Some players would rather pay 3% to NPCs than enrich other players by 0.1%. When you buy in Jita you can set the range of your orders to *station* so your stuff won't get spread around. And the 4-4 station undock is also much more interesting than the tethered Upwell safe zones.

I heard Carneros say that there is a lot of concern of the direction of Eve, and that players are having an emotional response to that. I think it‚Äôs pretty safe to assume that that describes me as of late. And it seems like the only thing I‚Äôve managed to do is to further decrease morale, and convince some people to unsub. I need to do better. I think I know what I want to do (besides put more thought into my actions), and will post a follow up as soon as I‚Äôm able. Hopefully, it‚Äôs a step in the right direction.

Yeah, I like thermal as a default. It only likely is heavily resisted by t2 gallente and caldari.

I had this happened to me quite a bit. On top of the lag, if it persits for too long I get disconnected with a "socket closed". I can't quite put my finger on it, as there are only some days when this happens a lot, while most days I get no lag and very stable connection. I even tried using 2 different VPNs to route differently along with different location servers, didn't change anything.

Has nothing to do with drones. I can be fine, no lag, no anything, for a week or even 2 straight with or without drones. Then get 3-4 bad and laggy days in a row even on turret ships, I like flying Phantasm for Electricals cause with its speed bonus I can clear the rooms + make it to the drill sites in addition to the default cache and still have enough time leftover to get back in if I of disconnect.

Also, the lag starts immediately upon arriving in Abyssal space. You can play burners outside, or be running escalations in LS or do hauling and marketing in and around Jita FFS and be lagfree, then you zone into Abyss and boom.
---
Default settings also play a role...
---
Not many play the Perimeter vs Jita game. I keep telling others that day to day station trading in Jita doesn't factor in other markets, i get a lot of counters to the points and i simply say "ok fine, setup a PLEX sale at jita Sell price, knowing its % marked up from Perimeter and wait"...and within few mins they sell.. I station trade while im at work (as i can sneak it open on a seperate monitor) and i've made billions ignoring Perimeter... i've sold a lot in Perimeter but it also means i have to haul between the two and while at work i can't take that risk outside watching Market Windows update..

Not everyone has to play the mega empire building and warfare game. With all the stupid politics, metagame and narrative building associated with it, it's boring af anyway.
---
We play a different Eve. We do nonconsensual pvp in innovative ways so we can do it places game mechanics make it very hard to operate. It's stupid when you quantify it with your metrics. Whether people's MER lowers, citadels die, sov is lost, membercounts failcascade etc is irrelevant to us. As long as we can  keep conducting our whaling, stuff keeps exploding, and space is a little less safe. And so far Goons have been helpless af particularly vs booshers lol. A minus 500-700b per month (across all booshers) is my gift to Delve Rorquals. You can't deny that that's money people would rather have not lost, or it is an accomplishment given that it was innovated by 1 person.

structures are set to green safety, so assume the same mechanics when you have your safety set to green. Is shooting your corp legal? If yes then you can shoot corp members.

I'm fairly positive this isn't because the drones are buggy. The ships in question break target locks on the drones and they swap to the next aggressive target.

---
Well, ostensibly. Realistically, it's for stealing vessels for piracy, tractoring them to yeet them into stations/planets/moons/the sun/other ships, and generally being an asshole.

because NPC stations are actually safe to keep stuff in without having to fuck with asset safety

Yes, but we all know Eve is at its heart a submarine simulator and naming a submarine after a bird was first done by CCP.

It also has to do with eye+target acquisition. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law are helpful to unpack what i mean here.. i was being sarcastic as i would wager more people use ISBOXer sneaky mode than "alt+tab".. but folks continue to defend them as ALT+TAB first until proven otherwise.

Which imho creates an opportunity for CCP just to say "you know what fuck it, Eve-o-Preview only, next question..."

Yeap, when I disagree with the drooling retards on r/eve, ima a fanboy of another product.
---
you are when its a blatant copy paste of the eve ship. This was shown almost a year ago and it was obvious at the time it was a ripoff, hell even their original "concept artwork" was rendered from the same angle as the eve concept artwork that had existed for years at the time, CCP even released a joke skin promotion making fun of them for it.
---
You have to get closer than 100k to spawn the npcs tho.  I think its something like 50/60k.  
---
Forget that, make PvE for entire cap umbrellas since all these guys are just mostly sitting there bored out of their asses anyways, and balance it so that average loss rate is roughly equivalent to T5 Abyss. That will solve a lot of problems.

I'm glad some people are being self-aware about how driving negativity (warranted or otherwise) can be. I stay away from /r/eve a lot compared to a year or two ago because people constantly shitting on the game (justified or not) makes me not want to play. It's a really shitty circle.

if you reported the player and ccp found nothing... just let it go.

I'm 1.5k deep and it's definitely going to be awesome. I trust them because the development is so open and they show you the tools they use to build the game and they have like 500 devs working on the game using the latest &amp; greatest technology available.

Funny thing is. Even if it's already replaced, it takes a day of mining in that one rorq to pay for the replacement cost (it's somewhere between 20 and 25 hours of mining).

How about remove Auto Agro feature instead ? Gilas are fine in PvP, its in PvE where they outperform other ships. If you nerf them then there is the otehr side of the coin, and Gallente already has enough bad ships on its plate as is. Starting with the Proteus and what they did to it not too long ago.
---
Also on a side note ,since its PvE, there is no need to touch the ships at all, just the mobs.

CCP doesn't ban Rorqual broadcasters.

Well I claim people are input broadcasting in Delve Goons get mad and ask for proof. When I post proof I get shit on.

I mean, that's all AT is... a way for everyone that can't beat goons to say "hey, we can beat you guys when we do arena style completely not EVE pvp! Sometimes... maybe.. well, one of us can

"
---
I wouldn't mind at all if all caps were completely banned out of FW systems. Not whole lowsec, just FW. As far as rest of lowsec, maybe the lower it goes let them turn on more modules ?
---
This way FW can stay FW, caps can still travel through it, but the higher sec systems will present more danger for them. Makes actual sense.

No it was not well liked. You are a reddit kid choosing to live and accept what your echo chamber tells you to think. You are a idiot spending that much space trying to compete AT ship value to any of those huge ships that any player in the game can build. Not eve the Titan is worth 1 At ship and you are so stupid you dont see the problem with giving away stacks of these ships every year. You are such a big idiot that you think the majority of EVE reads or posts here on reddit, they dont. Most people hate reddit because they see it for what it really is, same as AT.

This one will be a long one, I started eve in 2007 but went AFK and lost my account. Fast forward to 2014 and I was getting bored of the FPS games I was playing at the time. A friend of mine comes out of no where and says, hey play eve! This eventually leads me to play eve again, but it was such a long time since I played that I was a newb all over again. 
---
When I started playing eve again serious I chilled in high-sec, I joined a semi dead corp that was already dying, I didn't realize until later. We faced multiple war decs that our alliance leader was bringing upon us newbies (I joined eve with a former friend) and we eventually made the move to leave. I ended up joining the friend that told me to play eve again in an attempt to rent from delve, thing is this was two months before phoebe! We explored delve for a little bit until CFC said fuck off and we left null after one month or so. I lived in high-sec for a few years or so, but here is where the story builds up. 
---
While living in high-sec I did some pvp and joined a few fleets. I met many contacts and didn't think too much about at the time. For some time I just screwed around with random shitlord pvpers and didn't do too much. tried to run an alliance, realized I was shit at so ended that ordeal. Again, I didn't think too much of the things I did, just have fun is what I said. During this time I started my alt empire, created many alts (before ascension) and more after ascension. I did all this with no real goal, just wanted to get more alts to do more mining and stuff. I really had wanted to do wormhole stuff but after a bad eviction, I opted to stay away until I can get more people to join me next time.
---
Fast forward a few years, the same friend that got me back into eve said he was bored. He said he wanted to rent in null, he and I hated null drama and didn't want to deal with CTAs and the like so eventually we rented out some space. I still had alts out of renting corp so I had no issue committing to this. I had created the corp because I wanted to come up with a name, and because my directors ARE LAZY FUCKS, they said I made corp so im CEO. Its been another few years in the renter corp and I was just amazed. We started out with one astrahus, but now logistics allow us to ship from Jita in less than 30 mins, and we have much more than just one astrahus. Unfortunately in the process, I ended up kicking the same friend I joined eve with, because they were being stubborn, and uncooperative. This former friend eventually just removed me from his circle. I sometimes wonder had I just stuck to pvping in high-sec would I have lost a good friend? To this day it eats at me, but I just put up with it for the mean time.
---
As I'm strolling around eve with my alts, I read all these article about this group did that or this. Almost all the news about the things going has someone I know involved! You see all those little connections you make in eve somehow come back, and since now I'm a CEO with assets well worth in the 100s of billions I look at the game a bit more different than before. I then decide to poke around all those people I met back in the day and join their comms from time to time. This eventually leads up to an event where some Russians were making my life difficult. I had no means to defend myself, but simply poking one person I knew from back in the day led me and a few others to start a scamming scheme against these Russians. Not only did we push back the Russians, but even managed to scam their leadership of a sizable amount of isk. All this happened because I poked ONE guy that I met a few times (have only spoken to them 9 times in total to today) yet this fiasco occurs. Sadly someone in the group did end up embezzling the isk we scammed and biomassed (rip my isk). 
---
While this may seem like a long as read for a simple "Ha I scammed some Russians." the reality is that none of this would have occurred if I never enjoyed eve the way I wanted to enjoy it. By simply having fun and meeting others it eventually lead to this event. What people in the game need to realize is that it does not matter if you are renter tier scrubs or if you are some goon f1 monkey, simply enjoy the game and make contacts/friends. Eventually it will all connect back, for good or for worse. You make friends, and you lose some. To date I've had to create ten different cans in the eve cemetery for people I knew for years. Cherish the people you play eve with, my ex always wondered how I can call random strangers friends in eve. She asked how can someone you know nothing about be a friend and even have emotional attachment? I said this, "It does not matter who they are, it matters not what they do, they were there for me when I needed backup." They were there when I wanted to gank that piece of shit XIX bitch that thought they can fuck around with me. They were there when I wanted to fleet up and mine. What matters is that they were there for me when I needed them for something, that is all it takes.
---
TLDR Please remember to cherish your eve friends, meet them in real life, call each other shit, pod each other, mine, pve, and always remember that time spares no one.
---
&gt; Maybe you just want to see them input broadcasting, but in fact its not???
---
Maybe you just don't want to admit there is some broadcasting in a region of 40k accounts, because you are culturally conditioned to fanatically defend an alliance?
---
&gt; I mean people acuse you also of input broadcasting, should CCP also believe those people?
---
I twitch my activity so people have full access to how I conduct my activities. If they are accusing despite that, they are retards.
---
Imperium discord one one side, skillurself forum on the other - this guy spies
---
it gives players a reason to actually gank people as they can make a profit from what the ratter would've gotten. It will create content cause it will introduce a reward other than killmails to hunting nerds, since as it stands the vast majority of the ratting ship's cost lies in the hull.
---
It's either shit on it now, or watch it fade away for good. Either ccp wakes up and takes it seriously or 2019 will be the end of eve

you referred to toxic people when i mentioned you not replying to querns. so :P 
---
I don't even think that is true. The problem is ccp forced everyone into a subset of options. Look at npc null. Ccp has actively ignored it or even made it worse. Used to be one of the best places for casuals to play. Not anymore. 
---
Says olmeca the skirt wearing one trick pony!
---
You can‚Äôt use the guns if you‚Äôre not in a war with the target, gunner and structure have to be in war
---
Squish squish squish 
---
Yet, here you are.  
---
&gt; Imperium soldiers are never allowed to attend Legacy ops except on rare occasions when more firepower is needed.
---
so they're a feeder alliance, I see.
---
The general direction of EVE inching (seemingly) towards increased monetization of the player-base.
---
but you dont do that all the time you active right? so why are you not streaming all the time you are active, are you hiding the fact you are input broadcasting at that point?
---
At this point its a yes and no thing between you and me, the fact is CCP does not ban them, because there is no proof. Unless you are accusing CCP of beeing biased. If so, just say it.
---
And i am defending no 1, if CCP finds prove of botting/input broadcasting , CCP should ban them. But if people keep accusing people, while no prove is found, there should also be a penalty. Seems fair our not?
---
Details? I'll add it. Was this a part of the old [poitot.com](https://poitot.com) I'm not aware of??
---
i stole some idiot's isk but that must mean I'm not butthurt and ree goons.
---
I quit eve when injectors got announced. Makes no difference to me, infact i'd rather the game die naturally.
---
 Happy to provide a list of known toons.   This RMT scheme is the latest in his long list of scamming.  This is the stuff we submit reports on but don't hear anything....  We see it in our alliances on the daily . 
---
I think they don't care, game is sold
---
You sound like people assuming alt+tab until proven otherwise is a bad thing, would you rather presumed guilty until proven innocent? Because that is not the way the vast majority of people would prefer to live their lives.
---
Porn on the internet. 
---
Have they said anything recently about putting logi on killmails?
---
I've been watching people make this claim for a decade and a half, and it pre-dates me. That doesn't mean Eve is immune to it, I just don't take it seriously when people say this. While I personally don't think it's in an amazing place right now, especially for sov null, I chose to move to a wormhole instead of shitting on the game literally non-stop like I see a lot of people do. There is a massive difference between being critical of the game and shitting on it to shit on it. This subreddit specializes in the latter, not the former, typically. There are a lot of good points, but when they're regurgitated to ad infinitum it discourages the wrong group of people - the players reading - from playing the game.
---
jay's joke is about the 2 threads marshy posted about how it was "unsafe to rat in delve now" because of the 2 supers they've killed
---
I give you at least 1 reason (1.5 trillion) on why I can't be butthurt. You can't give me a single reason why I am lol.
---
You are more grr Olmec than I can ever be grr Goons.
---
El Jefe's heart will always be in Scalding Pass.
---
El Jefe welcomes your support! o7
---
You may not be proud but you've done a good deed, got your hands a little dirty in the meantime but hopefully if he ever did come back/ make an alt he would have learnt from his ways and be a better player because of it
---
&gt; but you dont do that all the time you active right? so why are you not streaming all the time you are active, are you hiding the fact you are input broadcasting at that point?
---
&gt; 
---
Why would I broadcast and risk getting banned all my investment and time in this game, when I do the same things easily without broadcasting?
---
Welcome to pearl abyss. They will make your game full p2w before they kill it. 
---
&gt; it gives players a reason to actually gank people
---
No, that's not how nullsec logistics work. It would maybe increase profits of people ganking JFs in lowsec and hisec. That's not organic content that'd create fun for different kinds of people.
---
Again, it works well for wormholes because you can get ganked taking wormholes.
---
No. A few months ago they said it would take a revamp of the entire killmail system but that the change is on the roadmap. But really, do Logi need participation medals? They already wear the freshest clothes and hang out with the chillest dudes.
---
It's a post done by me, any supporting comments will be downvoted by the hordes of haters because El Jefe marches to his own beat. Plus this wasn't a "I HATE CCP OR EVE ONLINE," which is what this sub-reddit is for right?
---
Do you consider yourself an investor and not a customer? When the boxed copies of the game ship is when I'm gonna look at it seriously. Everything before is effectively subject to change.
---
Do your part and upvote the NER
---
" If you push your skepticism hard enough, nobody is a broadcaster anymore."
---
and if you just keep yelling every 1, who has more then 1 rorq is a multiboxer, that makes it true???
---
It works both ways, but you are blinded by hate. And you accuse other people of beeing " culturally conditioned"
---
And the fact that you belittle people with saying things like " but they use round robin function, which leaves no trace; but you probably don't know what these are" says more about yourself then the people you attack.
---
Deleted by pa
---
I just think about the thousands of killmails I have missed out on, I'm insecure about being 5"
---
No dude,  you kill the ratter in the site(or gate whatever), the loot drops from the cargo like any other item. I'm not speaking of jfs.
---
It just means they are only available for a limited time. They won't ever disappear from your inventory or anything unless you use em. Some things however like cerebral accelerators have an expiry when they will be unusable. Also events sometimes will reproduce the same item as a previous event.
---
On this note I think the concept of pyrolancea/hardshell etc is bad because no one wants to think "uh oh these will no longer exist eventually so I'd better think super hard about using them". If they're gonna introduce buffing drugs or any pvp game manipulation through events it should be consistently supplied through events. Looking at you Geckos.
---
It was in the old site somewhere, I think it was an easter egg but I can't remember how you got to it. It's probably lost to the mists of time now if the old site has been taken down.
---
TBH by working on it they can activate more munchausen by proxy syndrome behaviours.... and with Brisc etc running defense on CCP's behalf... its just the nice mental health cocktail we love and enjoy ;)
---
Are we circlejerking about this again?
---
Didnt we do this last year? Can we come up with something new to hate please?
---
&gt;They should sue
---
and Star Wars for the Millennium Falcon especially as CCP also invented thousand year time periods.
---
not sure if hundreds or thousands
---
I guess CCP finally realized two things: 1. How massive the feedbackloop with skill injectors and rorquals was. 2. How due to that feedback loop almost 0 meaningfull concept changes to the overall game and specifically for (super) capital warfare are possible with out upsetting the balance towards 1-2 factions within eve. 
---
again, why would other people risk their time and investment in the game with input broadcasting???
---
So you know what kind of trouble it brings beeing reported, while you claim to be innicent. Other people have the same with you or any 1 else reporting them. 
---
Ones again, CCP has to be the investigator, judge and executioner, not you, not me. CCP should have the tools and the means to do that. We can agree on that or not, but there is no other way. We can report people, but its only fair that there would be a panalty for people who just report people for the sake of reporting people. I think it would make the life of the CCP people a lot easier in the long run.
---
That's a great read. I actually got back into EVE recently after quitting back in 2009, all because I felt I missed a huge part of the game since I was just a care bear ratting solo. I've gotten older and many of my rl friends have different schedules, have moved on or moved away. I live in a small rural town so most people don't have similar interests as me. Then it kinda struck me one day that I have access to interact with millions of other people, but I just don't like social media.
---
Now I have a new alt and got scouted into a friendly Corp for the first time. I haven't been super active lately because life, and a 3 week old pilot has shit skills, but I'm excited that I've met some people who want to ease me into low/null sec pvp. All I have to do is reach out and speak up, too bad it took me almost 30 years to realize that. Meeting people and making memories with them in a game is no less real than in meatspace.
---
TBF.. Bethesda also lets the community beta test their work once done. ... high five to all you Jita local chat players, great convos eh... high...nothing...no five?...nothing..sorry Jita is down ..fuck...
---
Blink two times if *they* threatening you
---
If you close your eyes and wish hard enough CCP will self correct the games issues....
---
Some absolute madlads even remap the recall command to a single key to achieve even more superhuman performance.
---
&gt; and you are here because you crave attention
---
Oh the irony.
---
At this stage Star Citizen is around 3 years away from being released. The reward is a 10&gt; year return on the investment.
---
Don't lie to yourself. at least i didn't make 10 + accounts , multibox and hang around in delve all day while associating with know input broadcasters such as marshy, all in the name of balancing goons. clearly you are more grr goons than i am grr Olmeca. :P 
---
If you want to run escalations it is far more consistent to buy them from your corp and alliance mates than it is to rat for your own. 
---
Yes PvE gets extremely repetitive and it‚Äôs why so many suggest finding other things and so many on this sub focus on PvP. 
---
The gila is fine. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs costs justify them pitiful increase in income from a VNI but use what you want. Ratting income only really becomes good at the carrier level. 
---
What kind of Corp doesn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt enough fleets to have logi? That sounds horrible. 
---
A ten greater than year return on investment?
---
Test Citadels still deal in standings! People don't want to lose clients due to war
---
We killed it again today
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/75231646/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75231646/)
---
Still not banned, somehow.
---
Not as strange as a flyover state OMEGALUL
---
:( Yeah it doesn't seem like the Flash object is archived on Wayback. RIP
---
I mean I'd like to get into PvP but I'm sure not really interested in supporting roles, maybe in a weirdo but it's just what I like. The alliance I'm in is pretty massive with like 900 members but the particular corp I'm in doesn't have many pvpers, I'd run with the other guys who do PvP a lot but they're mostly russian so I cant communicate with them.
---
Great, thank you for the answer :)
---
It is not and you do not understand eve.  If you actually understood the game you would key in on the RMT thread.  
---
We killed it again today, it warped to a fort when we entered system and just sat there. We bumped it for 15 minutes, then when it was untethered we aggroed it. It, of course, immediately and only then aggroed us back.
---
Because if you drew a radius on your possible range of people to come to join, 2/3 is either water or Canada.... so you only left with a 1/3 potential for people to come to join. Also, you have to compete with Toronto's meetup.
---
Your keepstar is not equipped correctly. I cannot see a single spreadsheet...
---
It's about the same. I've lived in both. I can tell you're pretty young and this conversation is useless.
---
W
---
..
---
By the way, if you're at war, the gunner MUST be at war with the target. You can't use neutral alts as gunners.
---
I wouldn't bet on that. Skillu is already over extended for their size. 
---
Ddddduuuunnnnkkkkkkeeedddd
---
I understand now thanks 
---
You mean Legacy for its size is incompetent without TEST
---
Pve is boring. Get that solidified in your mindset. You can spin in circles in a VNI and say "hey a Gila would be better because you have to actively assign missiles and drones" or you can say "hey a rattlesnake is like a Gila but I'd be fucked if it died so I better pay attention" but it really doesn't matter because the ticks are nearly the same. Regardless, it's fucking boring.
---
So then you get a carrier and then a super and you say "holy shit, this isn't boring because my God is this a lot of work but HOLY SHIT is this mind numbing... I can only do this in half hour spurts". 
---
So basically..  understand that making money can either be a little of work or a lot of mindless nothing... such is often true in life unless you land your dream job... and that sure as fuck isn't pve.
---
Dino brain is a real
---
This statement assumes goons cannot be beaten.
---
So what's the more active form of making isk?
---
No. It pokes fun.
---
Its not the first time [https://zkillboard.com/kill/74970705/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74970705/)
---
You should probably join a corp that speaks your language then.
---
And well that‚Äôs the thing with PvE. Either you go efficient and afk or active and slow. The one exception I can really think of is burner missions. Even some of those are extremely easy but if you get into blitzing those they can be excellent isk and more active. Some of the harder burners require precise timing and juggling overheat to do them successfully. 
---
You can PvP in dozens of alliances doing nothing but support roles. It‚Äôs all I do for the most part. I usually fly recons, logi, hics or long web Loki/long point proteus type stuff. 
---
How do you make money doing that though? Also it's not that my corp doesn't speak English it's that my alliance has German, Russian and English speaking corps, with English speaking corps being the smallest and the russian speak corps the more populated
---
Does it? When I read it it comes off as someone who eats crayons wrote.
---
Like this one.
---
First, go fuck yourself for:
---
&gt; Sure you wouldn't.
---
Second, I **explicitly** said multiple times in this thread that there is nothing inherently wrong with the 'empire building' style that major null blocs have adopted. That is not mutually exclusive, however, with being non-oppressive dickheads. Look at PANFAM. When wormholers roll into them, you know what they don't get? Supers dropped on cruisers.
---
At the end of the day, I do agree that CCP's parent company is to blame for what is in my opinion, a very sad state of the game resulting from corporate greed.
---
I have no idea. Making money is work. It isn't always all that fun. I suppose people make bank by Jita ganking but damn that sounds boring to me and shitty in terms of ethics. My alliance pays isk for killing enemies in certain home systems... so that's PvP that earns extra isk. If yours doesn't then you should lobby them to because it's a great incentive to keep things both locally safe but also enjoy local content.
---
Personally, I am an evil VNI multiboxer that uses my isk making time on Eve to catch up on Netflix shows. Hate me.
---
Our first Burn Reddit?  (or at least this sub) :V
---
That's a side effect of Panfam losing their edge, not Panfam being top blokes. When PL was at its height, they were the kings of dropping supers on anything that moved in their sphere of influence and everyone ranted at them about it.  
---
Leading me to believe this is something everyone does when they're the top dog, no? Which was where my skepticism of your holier-than-thou "It would be different if I were in charge!" attitude. Hence "Sure you wouldn't". If pretty much everyone has become oppressive when they were able to, why should I believe you?
---
Disappointed it's not a Thorax. 
---
I wish I had that type of skill
---
A reasonable response and deals with a larger viewpoint than most others in the thread.
---
No. I mean skillu has too much space for their size/numbers after today. But I'm sure their leadership will figure that out soon. Then again, some never learn from history, despite identical repeat performances of alliances that made the same failed overexpansion mistake over and over in Eve for the last decade.
---
Gotta love the hero sabre life
---
That ship is about the size of a drone in eve. Star citizen would never survive a fight with eve ships
---
I guess I'll be the one guy to suggest wormhole life. PVE is monotonous no matter where it is. And I highly support the post that suggested Abyssal sites as they are very dynamic and there is money to be made from the drops. That said, wormhole ratting can be exciting if only for spamming of dscan and constantly being under the pressure of being dropped on at a moment's notice--depending on the Intel in your chain. And that's the other thing, a changing gauntlet of random connections that expire after time or manipulation I find makes the game interesting with the added challenge in logistics and seeking content.
---
Some call it EVE on hard mode; I think if you're bored and would rather quit, give it a shot and see if it doesn't rekindle a spark for the game.
---
*Woah!* It's your **4th Cakeday** StainGuy! ^(hug)
---
Against tech II:
---
Amarr: Thermal then EM
---
Caldari: EM then Explosive
---
Gallente: Explosive then EM
---
Minmatar: Kinetic then Explosive
---
Against tech I:
---
Shield: EM then Thermal
---
Armor: Explosive then Kinetic
---
Hull: Any type
---
Remember that some pilots will fill their weak spots making them effectively more tanky than their secondary weak spots. This applies to both tech I and tech II ships. Thermal is generally the best damage to deal consistently to all tech I ships and EM is the best for tech II. However since you are using missiles you should do your absolute best to make sure you are firing your most effective damage at any target as that is one of the main advantages of missiles. 
---
To quickly remember which race is strong against which damage types remember the race's primary enemy. The minmatar have high EM/Thermal resists because they are built to fight Amarr lasers for example. 
---
No. 
---
Yes.
---
*Woah!* It's your **6th Cakeday** RequiemForDawn! ^(hug)
---
Then join a primarily English speaking alliance. If you can‚Äôt do everything you enjoy then why the hell stay? Most fleets in every other alliance in the game are alliance wide not corp only. 
---
It's actually kinetic, not em.
---
Because you don't log in to eve with your reddit account
---
Eventually.
---
You may be right. I used to run them last year and don't remember with 100% accuracy. But the idea is the same. Land far with sentry, and approach only about the final wave. 
---
I also remember anchoring a mobile depot and refitting for a bit more of tank/less dps if they come to close
---
Is it really that hard to repeatedly alt-tab and shift-R 3 different rorquals within a second?
---
&gt;BEE MAN GETS MAD WHEN YOU PISS ON HIS CHIPS.
---
Wrong. Bee man gets mad when there's no more gneiss in the belt.
---
all this from someone who's such an embarrassment their own alliance asked them to get off reddit
---
Peak concurrent users (eg.33k) is generally considered around 10% of the active playerbase in gaming. EVE may be slightly higher, who knows, but you would roughly need to multiple your estimate of 7.9 mill per year by 10ish to get a more realistic number.
---
I know there is a botting problem, but I am sure every single player is not logged in every day 23.5/7.
---
Oh really? I missed the memo I never got and could give a fuck about another nobody like you D:
---
10% of the active paying accounts are logged in? ...thats...crazy dormant numbers... but fuck it, 79 million would be a big burst...but if they are actually pulling down that kind of revenue stream 500-1k in staff isn't relative to the growth / revenue figures.. so Hilmar and co are just hoarding the $$ and/or dumping it into random IP product lines that go nowhere. Which is obscene amount of waste in comparison... 
---
Hauling is a more active way to make isk. Margins are a lot tighter, returns are worse than mining/ratting and there's a pile of scams to wade through, but no two trips are alike especially if you're delivering in and out of nullsec.
---
Soon‚Ñ¢
---
LETS GO WOLVERINES

MER report=Olmeca bait

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Yet, Goonies continue unabated creating wealth with no real attributable contribution to either seeing MER values reduced or ISK destroyed increasing. It could be argued that you are failing miserably. 
---
It does appear that your thinking is skewed towards just a hate boner for goons as they use mechanics to better the value of their space and the industrial output of their SOV. If you are just here to steal drones, then good luck on your endeavour as there is little activity elsewhere in EVE to do this.
---
He doesn just sound like a douche, he's also a lobbyist
---
didnt read your post but ill just inform you that the game is still crap and only getting worse, if you managed to free yourself do not get pulled back in
---
because ccp are incompetent, true and only answer
---
&gt; MER values reduced. It could be argued that you are failing miserably.
---
That assumes my goal is suppressing your MER.
---
&gt; hate boner for goons 
---
The very fact that you assume I want to suppress your MER means your hate boner for me is bigger than any boner I could possibly have for Goons.
---
&gt; use mechanics to better the value of their space and the industrial output
---
Its funny how every Goon repeats the same argument again and again. Shows how much brainwashing and circjejerking going on in there lol.
---
From my understanding, CCP has GMs who are at least party responsible for investigating accounts. I don't know if that is a position represented in the above numbers, but I suspect there are more then two people investigating bots and rmt. This may still be low as I doubt the GMs do more then investigate and ban people using existing tools and are not involved in developing better ways of combating botting. It would better explain the 3000 detected offences that CCP quoted though.
---
Its way easier to silence people than it is to make a game that's fun and worth playing
---
Yeah I factored that in but to me they‚Äôd be more likely first responders ‚Äúdid you see the live do the Eula breach‚Äù and if no it‚Äôs likely be handed off to an analyst for deeper search.. so it‚Äôs why I can see they add value but taking a leap of wager the bulk of the verification would likely live I. Analysts hands given how pissy we can be about ‚Äúproof‚Äù
---
But fair points
---
No, d-scan can give you an idea of where the wrecks are if they're at a celestial or beacon.
---
Wrecks cant be scanned down with probes, however if a player or drone is still in a mission pocket, then you can scan them down and get the wrecks that way.
---
Once upon a time he constantly talked about how his shenanigans were going to effect the MER.
---
When that failed, he turned to "hurr durr dum goon think MER is lyfe"
---
Using what you can turn up on LinkedIn is a pretty shit basis for any kind of analysis TBH. I know you said it's probably "not 100% accurate" but I think you'd be pushing to be 20% accurate given the number of people who don't bother with LinkedIn or don't bother maintaining their profile.
---
If all I had was LinkedIn and a bunch assumptions about the alpha/omega ratio and sub numbers was to go off I'd probably not bother trying to cobble something together at all.
---
There is always one in the crowd and you‚Äôre the one I can tell .. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry snowflake this won‚Äôt affect your eve donwunder ball cupping session with ccp .. Yeah no .. 20% .. fuck me math is hard for you as well as determining what day of the week you‚Äôre on .. oi fuckhead it‚Äôs what day.. Tuesday.. Sunday .. what a muppet you are.
---
You have to take into account alpha accounts as well as sub vs PLEX account. A (500) PLEX is $19.99 but this number will either be higher if that 500 is made up from multiple smaller purchases so it could be $19.99 for those 500 or $22.68 (500/110*$4.99) or $16.23 if they purchased a larger pack. So one omega account could give different amounts of income based on if you sub (least income at $14.99 to $10.95 a month) or you PLEX (and which pack the original purchaser got). Players may purchase extended subs at a time and yet never log in with their 50 skill queues. 
---
It makes me laugh how people protest EVE/CCP by PLEXing their account like it doesn't give them more money than subbing does (if each PLEX is truly actually purchased). 
---
Plus any additional revenue from PLEX purchased but not used/spent in game store or not yet purchased for game time. Or other income like merchandise.
---
Unless they made their income public, it's impossible to tell. 
---
Then stipulate what your goals are and how you intend to measure them. You cannot achieve anything without having a metric to measure success. Inform the reddit community of what this is and let the community decide.
---
What keeps me going is all the new friends i‚Äôm going to make in this quirky galaxy. 
---
Let‚Äôs make out own Eve in the unreal engine
---
As much as it sucks, I think the original video was necessary for transparency. It essentially spelled out what we have all been thinking, and it more logic and reasoning in it than most other doomsayers/negative nancys. Even if there were some  false assumptions, the onus is on CCP to dismiss the claims at cashgrabbing/pay for convience, and clear the negativity. OP silencing himself is being too generous..his concerns and the hivemind that shares them deserve to be addressed.
---
Also factor in how much stock inside the game goes unused or bought via in game only .. granted the plex buy cycles still need to occur there is a metric tonne of plex stockpiled each day from dormant purchase of the past .. so it‚Äôs also unaccounted for revenue (1;1 per account where as folks could RMT legit or illegally to stockpile plex beyond subscriptions)
---
Very hard number to guesstimate but the above is a feeble attempt 
---
This has to be a new low for MMO players trying to armchair manage the company that makes their video game
---
Maybe literally read the comment tree upward?
---
&gt; Our goals are more subtle. Delve is full with 0 skill 0 achievement utter moronic carebears farming in 0 velocity like these, like it is hisec. These people are the average Goon now. You provide them hisec level protection using game breaking mechanics untouched by CCP. They provide you with +1s in your titan fleets and dank MER stats. Our job is done when these people feel a little bit of risk in their necks. To quantify it, you can ask your Rorqual pilots whether they can afk mine as they used to.
---
I dunno you could be a commenter on the said low point ... whooops ..
---
 As much as it sucks, I think the original video was necessary for  transparency. It essentially spelled out what we have all been thinking, and contained more applied logic and reasoning than most other  doomsayers/negative nancys in the crowd. He even says that everything in it is tinfoil not fact but simply food for thought. Even if it contains false assumptions, the onus is on CCP to dismiss the claims at cashgrabbing/pay for convenience, and clear the negativity. OP silencing himself is being too generous..his concerns and the hivemind that shares them deserve to be  addressed. 
---
maybe, you should not focus so much on earning ISK?  
---
If not focused on ISK, things can get more funny. A fleet of 8 or more Tristans with speed tank doing lvl4 missions can be really funny, especially on comms ;-)  
---
try to optimize the usage of your actual ship. Find tactics to minimize incoming damage AND to be able to "carebear" out to a safe spot if reds appear ;) Find fun in the doing itself. It may take 5 minutes more to complete a site but keeps your mind connected and skilling times appear a bit shorter ;-)
---
  
---
try out corps and alliances and do things together and finally find the one, you want to stay at.   
---
EVE is about doing things together, not alone  
---
I had to stop reading at "CCP makes 5-10 million per year"  
---
33k is not the subscriber count! It's not the same 33k logged in. There are hundreds of thousands of active subscriptions to EVE at any given time.
---
"I am officially running for CSM"
---
That was mentioned in my point three.
---
I would love to see the stats personally. How much PLEX is purchased, how big people normally buy, how much is actually spent on time vs isk/in game shop/sitting in people's cargo holds (so to speak). But they would never release it and it's just because I find it interesting than any sort of 'let's work out how much CCP is ripping us off'. They are a company and can spend their money however they want. If I feel a companies product is suffering from cheapskate-iness, I'll stop giving them money. 
---
I know personally, I'm not a whale but I'm a high spender in 'extras' in games. I know I've spent a lot more on PLEX over the years than on sub (and I've never used PLEX for game time) but I also know I'm not the average player so can't judge others actions on my own. 
---
What changes do you think would help with that? How do you nerf organization? Because that cyno only helps because of how the whole group is organized with a defense fleet. Thats not really a mechanic... Unless you want to change how cynos work somehow
---
People have lives dude. Most people who play this game play it a few hours a day, many less than that even.  
---
Just because we are obsessed with this game doesn't mean at any given point during prime time that EVERYONE with a sub is logged in. 10% is probably a good estimate for prime time at any given point.
---
It's a Zombie game, has been since 2011
---
Who's mar5hy, olmeca, and leonia. I only see olmeca on reddit. What is it that they are doing again?
---
delve is super unsafe to rat lol
---
Rarely
---
Yeah no shit .. hence the quantitative metrics not the qualitative analysis on metrics .. and out of all that this is the hill you want to die on ‚Äúplex is under valued‚Äù .. fuck .. I often wonder how eve pilots get past the login tbh 
---
Is this in the abyss or just in general? I've had a couple corpmates with this problem, one of them turned out to have an issue with their router(and a really shit ISP), and the other is playing on old hardware.
---
I know most enjoyed the video, but for me it reeked of youtube-style conspiracy theories.
---
Oh look another thread hyperbolic thread about bots claiming they're the backbone of major alliances.
---
Bots are annoying, there are a lot of bots, bots are in all of the major alliances, probably more common amongst renters and Goonswarm than anywhere else.  
---
No, bots are not the backbone of large alliances. Let's put our brains back inside our heads ok?
---
Makes sense that you would critique the workforce makeup and effectiveness of CCP while basically being nonproductive in your own career.
---
Fuck.
---
The fuck are you talking about? I never said anything about plex?  
---
Also, you said that EVE's revenue is likely 5-10 million USD because of this retarded claim that EVE has 33k active players at primetime therefor it has 33k subs. Don't pretend you didn't. How do YOU get past the login?
---
There is an ingame channel 'pinoy'
---
These are not goals! You cannot measure this as its subjective. You sir are not having clearly defined goals to mitigate against the real chance of failure as statistically the data suggests the opposite. This of course in turn gives you a chance to argue success, but to argue people cannot afk mine cause you are in delve. Lol.
---
I agree with you but I still downvoted because you kinda asked for it with that smug last line.
---
cool stuff and cool music. thanks!
---
Unbelievable Jeff :)
---
You had my attention until this bit.
---
&gt; Likely costs for Amazon cloud hosting / on prem would be upwards of 50-100k a month best guess... but depends highly on the setup/architecture.
---
Eves hosting setup is extremely well documented. The fact you just went "oh idk they probs use AWS" makes me suspicious of the rest of your numbers.
---
&gt;But for whatever reason they came in close with the enyo
---
GEE I WONDER WHY YOU WOULD GET REALLY CLOSE WITH AN ENYO AND A JAGUAR
---
wtf toxic
---
You took that criticism well lmao
---
Arrogant bastard.
---
Lack of communicating a vision and plans for the game isn't something we dream up man.
---
Thank you for this!
---
The same reason other player hubs haven't taken off. I don't want to trade somewhere where my entire stock can be in safety for a week. Not only is it not worth the hassle for 2% (who but the most desperately intense station traders gives a fuck about 2%?) but there's a decent chance I'm going to end up spending half that saving and a fuckload of time relisting everything. Just... no.
---
SKINs, extractors and MCTs probably add a good chunk of revenue too...
---
WORDS WORDS WORDS WORDS
---
yeah i read it on the train and i was like "WHAT...what... how..what.." thats real-time me processing the tardy comment lol
---
&gt; You cannot measure this as its subjective.
---
Lol we play to kill ships and make space unsafe. We do not have 
---
anything to prove you. We can see our effect when we irritate a region so much that tens of people hunt us for hours. Or when Rorquals can't afk farm anymore. Our goal is to kill ships and make space less safe. We are doing it fine. You can check the kills or how much we steal from data avaiable.
---
What you keep not getting is that not everyone plays Eve your way. We don't measure success with MERs and propaganda and membercount and citadels destroyed and sov space invaded. We are literally 10 people irl too, so it's not like we can make any difference that way. 
---
Cool.. so..whats the number then... or...is that it?
---
Yep, I still play. Which alts did you try to grab me on? I've parceled some off over the years.
---
So this is your hill... plex... fuck me.
---
Love you man.. you know this right...
---
Hardly
---
Wow, that was well done. I might have to try an AB Tormentor.
---
fear mongering much tbh, average daily users is pretty stable since 2016.   
---
No sign of the impending doom on the horizon. Yes, Gatcha-Style is on the horizon, but I doubt it's gonna cause all too much trouble in the short-med term (2-5 years). 
---
I left them out as if PLEX causes the autists in the room to go into a loop driven screeching session i won't touch the additional revenue streams as that number is vague to infer any quantitative metrics around.
---
here you go, here's you CCP sippy cup... of you go snowflake...leave the adults to talk while you go play.
---
I didn't say it was a dream. What I was trying to explain was that the lack of communication a vision and plans for the game is, at least in some ways, the result of how those visions and plans have been received by the community in the past. It's a self-defeating prophecy. 
---
You humorless bastards. 
---
&gt;Star Citizen needs to steal more Eve ship designs tbh
---
Every Space game should have a Raven
---
Oh yeah it's Tuesday. 
---
&gt;Yeah no .. 20% .. fuck me math is hard for you as well
---
So you see how unconvincing numbers you pull out of your arse are?
---
The game went through serious crisis in 2011. Corrective action happened and it recovered.
---
It would not have recovered if there hadn't been negativity then. Had the 'Greed Is Good' memo not been leaked but instead slowly implemented, I don't think the game would exist today.
---
That's fair enough, but if you're going to speculate on revenue and make a claim like "CCP doesn't make a lot of money" then you can see why being off by a factor of 10 or more is probably worth less than if you had left that part out completely. 
---
Sorry if you think that making arguments on totally wrong numbers causes autistic screeching. I'd call it critical thinking, but whatever.
---
Yep the thread is an work of art by u/Hikkata
---
so..you're saying that 80% of the CCP collective staff at all points in their career past and present are not a fan of linkedin.
---
What motivated you to comment? honestly would love to unpack how the fuck you came up with that number.
---
To be fair I could have been a bit gentler, but the dude reading that and going straight to quadrupling down on the ad hominems is pretty telling.
---
&gt; How do you nerf organization?
---
Organization is a myth you think what makes Delve super safe. In fact its a combination of OP umbrella mechanics and blobbing. No matter how organized you are, if you weren't the biggest blob, then you wouldn't have access to Delve's safetty.
---
But let's suppose you are indeed organized. You can make space less safe given the best organized alliance lives there. Currently most "organized" spaces lose 3% of their mining for example. The aim would be pulling it up to something like 15%. I have long posts on how. 
---
1) Nerf anomaly respawns to make sure people [have to spread farming](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/) activities out.
---
2) [Rework cyno inhibation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/amgj7y/capital_projectioncynojump_drive_balance_three/) so people have to rely on subcaps for defense.
---
3) Rework fighters to old drones' stats before the citadel expansion.
---
4) Make dreads more mobile with c7 wormholes with ns static accomodating 10-15 dreads in one go.
---
Your saying as much as 99% do? 
---
Hey thats a showcase, not a *real usage*.   
---
No its an indicator that they're not making 100's of millions per year and just doubling down on 2-3 products outside of EVE is really the point here.. in that Eve being the primary adoption product isn't actually raking in the rate of scale here. Even with those additional SKU's i doubt they'd be a tipping point past the PLEX revenue stream combined.
---
As to my earlier points, PLEX is also stockpiled as well as at times accounts would likely buy more than 1x round per month.. so speculating on the accuracy of the PLEX sales is moot but indicative to the ratio of employees, population size of the game 'active logins' and lastly growth velocity of features... its not a great story to tell but it's got enough of a metric foothold to likely explain why they are the way the are at the very least...
---
dude, are you for real? where did my corp touch you? you smell like a Tri poster. 
---
At least 9 accounts open at all times!
---
imagine that your killboard was as good as that mouse clicker.
---
I don't disagree, but the massive difference then is that primary communication used to be spread amongst several different communities. Eve-O, FHC, Kugu, and this Sub. By and large, this subreddit has taken over as the primary area by which to talk to other players, and even community/developers at times, and at times creates an incredibly hostile and self-feeding negative feedback loop. It's fine to point out issues with the game, and it's great to get issues fixed and improve the game, but 10 threads a day where dumb f1 monkeys mimic the shit other people say in an attempt for Karma or to seem intelligent is entirely grating and makes myself, and I'm sure many others, not want to even visit the subreddit. The game isn't in a healthy place at the moment, and I think a lot of people see various issues causing that. The bottom line is that this is CCP's only source of revenue at the moment, so they have just as much on the line - if not more - than us players who have been here forever. I don't have blind faith in anyone or anything, but I think with time, as in all things, we'll see some of these issues get leveled out. Not all of them, the things that are going to appease the small alliances aren't going to make the AT teams happy, and the things that help gigantic blocs isn't going to help small alliances, and any other combination you can think of. 
---
Personally, rather than piss and moan about how my favorite thing in this game (small communities and small independent alliances) is no longer possible in sov null due to both mega blocs/predatory alliance practices, and unfavorable game mechanics, I just moved my group to somewhere where that's still possible, even if Wormhole mechanics gave them quite the head spin when we moved in. Unfortunately, there's not a solution like that to the big problems like super capital proliferation, rorquals, skill injectors, etc, but I still enjoy playing with the people I do, and at the end of the day, that's what matters most to me. 
---
imagine you being so relevant that anyone cared tbh
---
You need to probably re-read the first paragraph carefully before you go into your "i hate stuff" comment loop...
---
"here's some random data points i've collated from the source LinkedIn" ..now..i'll help you along here.. the words you want to focus on are "from the source linkedin" (Clue: its in the title as well).
---
Is there more people outside LinkedIn not accounted for...absolutely..is it by large proportion..probably not... but to say 20% of CCP staff from its entire 18 year history have avoided LinkedIn (as again...reading down further you'll see this "1,726 have worked or presently working at CCP (currently 96 in UK and 203 in Iceland remain)")
---
All good now champ? or you want to keep doubling down on stupidity?
---
What did I do this time? 
---
I edited to add more to the comment as you were replying FYI. 
---
your original estimate way way too low. I worked for CCP between 2010 and 2014, every year revenues were in excess of 65 million USD, the addition of skill injectors reportedly had a very positive effect on revenues. Developers in Iceland are not cheap and the vanity projects in Atlanta, Newcastle and Shanghai spent it all, salaries weren‚Äôt even high for the local area in Reykjavik (they‚Äôre now competitive though)
---
To your other points, Producer was the powerful middle manager role and generally the people who held the role weren‚Äôt suited to it by either having near zero experience of EVE or weak engineering or design qualifications, a LOT of good engineers and designers got sick of the lack of autonomy and bailed over the years. 
---
The EVE dev team has been roughly the same size for years but has experienced a significant amount of turnover and loss of experienced developers without like-for-like replacements available. 
---
A lot of good folk do still work there and care a lot so as unlikely as this is to lift the general malaise on this sub, no-one is activity trying to shit over your good time, resourcing just requires the people at CCP to make prioritizing decisions 
---
Dude what the hell are you smoking? I didn't mention plex once. Are you actually retarded?  
---
Are you incapable of understanding the fact that the 33k active players are not the only people subbed to the game, and that it's not always the same 33k?
---
&gt; Unfortunately, there's not a solution like that to the big problems like super capital proliferation, rorquals, skill injectors, etc, 
---
Those are the reason that I don't think this game has much of a future. 
---
I've stopped paying but I have about a trillion in assets so I can buy PLEX whenever I want. I'm doing that unless/until I decide to move on. If things change, well, that might make me subscribe again.
---
&gt; but I still enjoy playing with the people I do, and at the end of the day, that's what matters most to me.
---
Yep. When this game goes dark or when I move on, there's people I will keep in touch with. Hell there's other dying/dead games I log into on occasion.
---
The difference is that where 5 years ago I was trying to recruit people from other games to EVE, now I try to recruit people away from EVE and into other games.
---
&gt;but I am sure every single player is not logged in every day 23.5/7.
---
FC, what is alts

---
Well I'd say exploration is one of the most active ways to make isk. It can net you good isk/hr, but somedays you might end up with nothing. So it's a bot unreliable/luck based income. But nothing says you can't actively rat in a non-drone ship, people just prefer drones because the low effort once ratting gets boring. I myself rat in tengu in wormholes, so I'd call that active ratting, not just because you need to manage trigger spawns and targets but you need to check dscan and be on alert. 
---
source?
---
So you don't connect sub with plex... (sigh)... just...sigh..
---
RUS))2.0
---
stop ingesting tide-pods fuck
---
Yeah ok so the 69-70mill is the kind of best guess (thumb) so thats not far off i guess given the edits thereafter.
---
I wondered the Producer role would be likely the breaking points. I've seen that often in various creative companies where they are quite disconnected from the engineering/quality assurance muscles... you need balance in power here so i'm not shocked tbh. Sad..but not shocked.
---
Looking at the Engineering resumes on display, I mean they quite skilled so if anything this exercise made me take notice of the level of intellect thats being pumped in the game...so i agree... there is likely a large amount of talent.. however i can't see how they could consume all the work thus far and maintain parity with stability and shift/lift to new architectures while growing features...
---
more like tree fiddy thousands
---
1) asking a CSM person would breach their NDA so thats a no go
---
2) asking CCP would result in silence and if they answered...well.. i'd be questioning their sanity...why confirm that number ..why
---
And if you don't find value then hit back and move the fuck on... but to stand here and say "nah this is my moment to shine"... you're still wrong.. you're effectively saying approx 300-600 people past/present have avoided LinkedIn .... not just during their time at CCP but for all career from hence forth... thats... thats a neat trick in software industry to avoid.  
---
Had you said 20% were probably missing i'd say yeah probably..
---
Because screw Legacy/Horde/'Max-blues-nullsec-groups' attempts to control more of the game.  I'm not going to willingly give Legacy and groups like that more power over the game.  Jita is 100% neutral. 
---
Same thing with Isk.  I'm not going willingly give them isk if I can avoid it.
---
ITT: Man wastes workday LinkedIn-stalking strangers, writes 4000-word essay making wild claims, calls anyone who disagrees with him a "snowflake".
---
Maybe if you had used the full Microsoft arsenal the data would be more accurate.
---
Reduce the radius of your probes?
---
Center probes on a signature, scan, center on the (improved) result, decrease scan radius, scan repeat. This should at least improve the scan percentages of the signatures. With low skills you wont be able to get all sigs to 100%, but most should work. I was scanning data/relic sites in wormhole space in my first month in a similar fit. Better skills and experience don't change much about the basics; they just make the process a lot faster, and enable to get even the hard sigs to 100
---
hahah there it is... fuck that train is never late. Microsoft Arsenal.. zinger.
---
yikes
---
Lol 4 years of fight for lowsec gate to Stain           
---
Fuck this queue is long
---
I will give it another go when im back from work,  its just frustrating that after 3 days of trying,  it wont work.  Still good fun tho.  But thank you for the reply
---
Tried that,  but thanks for the reply
---
&gt; is generally considered around 10% of the active playerbase in gaming.
---
By whom? Based on what??
---
ITT: OP pulls some numbers out of his ass.
---
Then people respond by pulling some more numbers out of their asses.
---
this would end one of the only ways a solo capital player can play, with a haw dread or carrier in a fw complex. changing cynos, removing nsa's or changing them so that they only allow faster locking of enemy fighters not actual ships. remove the god damn useless and silly warp core stability supers have, it serves no purpose
---
Common sense. I don't know about hundreds of thousands but for sure more that what you see logged on every day. I would estimate the number to be around 100 thousand active subs since not every player will be logged on at any given time.
---
More to the point, when it was 350k subscribers the active player count was...
---
wait for it...
---
35k

---
So the stuff I've been saying all this time is vindicated. If eve has 33k active players, you can assume probably close to 330k subs. Not 33k subs. Anyone with a brain can figure this out intuitively without the need for data, but you appear to be special like OP and need it spelled out to you that 33k logged in players does not mean 33k subscribed players.
---
timer for spool up on cynos, remove warp core stab from supers. and change NSA so it doesnt instalock. these things would remove any unwanted capital attention in FW space, no 'hotdropping' only strategical placements. no instalock nidhogger on a gate.  muuuuch less people running around FW space with thier super, practically uncatchable. but you do get, random dude in a haw pheonix fighting the world. which is alot of fun to shoot at. and completly choice to do so or not.
---
Exclusive only in Abyss. Like I said, I play the game, everywhere, normally, even super trafficcy places like Jita and have no lag. Zone into Abyss, lag.
---
Also as I said, happens for few days at a time, usually like 3-4 days, and then goes back to normal for a week or 2. This also in the Abyss while rest of game works fine.
---
You're making assumptions based on 8 year old data (before alpha characters were a thing) and then call me special.
---
Yeah okay buddy.
---
&gt;33k logged in players does not mean 33k subscribed players.
---
Nobody disagrees with this btw. 
---
Nope, let the Rorq and bot gotten shit stay in fucking Rorq and botlands. Its where it belongs.
---
because FW doesnt have bots right?
---
&gt;Random LinkedIn CCP Factoids.

So to clarify "EVE evaluation even in an Asian market wouldn't likely go beyond 20-50million a year on year (\*\*EDIT: turns out its around 80million a year\*\*)? fuck do not know... how even to speculate the ROI on that one." 
---
so your seizure point is you arguing the toss of where i put the edits and you couldn't get out of your reee--loop to read on.. hence my confusion.. now back to PLEX... so player metrics in turn means what... so you say subs my think is a sub is a plex cycle... or you trying to fold in the split between omega/alpha now too..
---
Actually fuck it...what is it your desperately trying to die on here... i'm wrong about revenue ? no shit... i don't recall saying "Oh this is absolutely accurate shit don't question it.."  
---
Ok
---
OP asserted 33k subs, it's how they originally got $5-10M revenue
---
They don‚Äôt have more strength. Their lowest radius setting is just smaller. 
---
OP calculated his "CCP makes 5-10 million USD annually from EVE" from that 33k number. That's what all of my comments have been about.
---
And if you spent 5 seconds thinking about how MMOs work, and how people don't fundamentally change regarding how much they spend logged into the games they enjoy vs. doing other tasks/activities, you'd realize that the absolute sub count doesn't matter so much as the ratio of active players to subs, which is what I'm talking about. And the amount of active players in 2k11 was very similar to the amount of active players now, so even if my argument relied on assuming similar sub counts (it doesn't, it could be 200k subs and OP's math would still be off by a factor of almost 7), we are probably looking at similar sub counts compared to 2011 because we have similar numbers of active accounts compared to 2k11. If we want to count alphas, we could lop off 20% which is quite generous. His numbers are STILL way off.
---
I mean, burying one's head in the sand and pretending EVE is NOT going in this direction helps even less.
---
Wow look, a bee in a gif/video/picture, let me share this shit on r/eve because it's cool! Just like the Dino suits, its low effort crap. GJ.
---
There are literally goons replying to Olmeca in other threads about how they think twice about afking with excavators out or how they have to pay a lot more attention to their rorq screen when he hits intel.
---
This are not hateful replies, because they recognize that this is the great thing about Eve. 1 person, through immense amount of effort, had an impact, albeit a small one, on the minds of members of the largest alliance.
---
:face plam: ... so... this is the point you two want to land.. that 80% of the entire CCP staff have not only in the past, but to this very minute in time... avoided the use of sites like LinkedIn to win/lose jobs over the past 18 fucking years.
---
I feel like this is just a troll but then i realise you're being serious..and and i just don't know what else to think/say on the subject.. its like reality is over here...you're over there..and no matter what i think to say..you're like "nup, no way bro...data is a lie....its false..."
---
So... that would put CCP at around maybe 3000\`ish staff in total ......so....you're going actually sit there and say CCP best head count is between 2000+ but no more than 3000
---
Fuck it..what is the number give me a number... or ...you just prefer to do the comment drive by?
---
Maybe try out abyssals. They are more challenging and active than anom ratting, but are probably less rewarding on average.
---
&gt;I don't broadcast because I multibox for a living
---
Literally 99+% of multiboxers in the game can say that. 
---
Yes there will be a few people in the game who cheat via Input Broadcasting but it ain't fucking everyone who just happens to be able to pull in their Excavators quickly. I can sent the Recall command to 10 Rorqs in about 2-2.5 sec just using EVE-O Preview.
---
&gt;And I twitch my activity to provide full proof. A spodbrain miner is likely to be a broadcaster becauase he doesn't provide such proof
---
Who wants to watch a twitch of some dude doing nothing but mining for a few hours? (Unless the streamer is one of those that have a fun chat with his stream while he mines). Also that can just give free intel to those hunting said Rorq pilot. Just because you stream as "Proof" that you don't Broadcast doesn't mean that literally every other Multiboxer has to give a stream as "Proof".
---
Red dawn sounds great - someone suggested Dead Winter in a previous thread and I really like that one too. I hope they pick something cool.
---
That seems like a very accurate and succinct reply
---
tapi of all groups should know that being overextended doesn't matter if you can diplo your way into nip-secured borders, particularly in space that doesn't have empire or npc space in range of it
---
Dude just edit the 5-10 mil per year revenue claim. You even say at another point that it's probably closer to 80 mil or something like that, which would be much more accurate.  
---
You're the one picking a hill to die on by arguing with me about a revenue estimate that makes no damn sense at all, and not in the "numbers might be off" way, but in the "so wrong that it's useless as an estimate" way.
---
We were all noobs without much of a clue. Agang of us had decided to form a little corp and help each other with missions, mine together and just chill. An older player started to take an interest in the corp and gave us some advice, so we invited him to a chat channel. About two weeks later we got our first wardec. A single player in a tricked out assault frig. Not one of us had ever got to training T2, apart from the CEO who just had bought a shiny new kitsune, so it was pretty scary...even more so as he kept popping up where we were trying to avoid him and taking down our cruisers and destroyers. 
---
I'd never heard of locator agents at the time, and really thought it was strange he always knew where we'd be and how to find us. Then I noticed that the older player in chat would log off at almost exactly the same time as our war target logged on. We had one more major fuck up before we could get organised. I was out on night, and the guys decided to face him head on an assortment of frigs and lost ten or so ships.
---
Next night we were ready. The older player was in chat and said he had to log. Sure enough, wt logs on directly. We had the plan involving a bait destroyer and a lot of bumping to keep him from getting away. 
---
Everything in place and bait told us wt had just jumped to system. We were all really nervous because of what had happened the previous night. Bait tells us that the target had seen him at the gate and was heading for him 30km away at full speed. We all jumped into system and headed to the fight. The bait went down quickly, almost before anyone got a second point and we thought we'd lost the chance..but wt must have been overconfident because of the night before, and turned back to face us. This time we'd brought the biggest ships we could and started hammering on him. The Vengeance was a tough little ship with the armor resistance bonus and it must have taken us a good 15 minutes shooting before it blew up. The screams and whooping on voice chat were unbelievable. My jaw had locked with the tension and it was minutes before I could even talk. A couple of other said the same...they'd been clenching their jaws the whole time and could barely open their mouths. That feeling of joy..and physical pain is what eve offered that no other game could. I've felt pleasure at getting through tough bosses and reaching maximum levels etc in other games, but never that sense of accomplishment and teamwork that went into that first kill. 
---
You just can‚Äôt derive such precise information as the qa/dev ratio from some shitty linked in scrapping. You just can‚Äôt. What if 80% of QA are contractors that don‚Äôt list CCP in their LinkedIn because they work for other company? That‚Äôs how it works in my firm actually. Your number is as good as completely made up. Not seeing that is actually shocking and worrying for somebody who claims to work in the industry but anyway. 
---
It‚Äôs important to remember you won‚Äôt be able to achieve 100% on all sigs.
---
If your scanning skills are low, you‚Äôre using core scanner probes or you‚Äôre trying to scan down something of a high level, you won‚Äôt be able to do it unless you are properly equipped.
---
In all honesty, if you can‚Äôt scan it, it‚Äôs probably not something you want to go near anyway.
---
I like your blops idea... and I‚Äôve always pushed for ways to introduce some resource scarcity into eve. I like how aegis sov discourages building wide... but if you introduce scarcity that might encourage it without making it easy you might see null empires create enclaves since mechanics wouldn‚Äôt support outright expansion... in these enclaves they would naturally be more vulnerable than at home. Would be nice to get some natural wars in new eden... where people are fighting over more than dick sizes. I don‚Äôt see why you find it odd that a couple squadrons of fighters would be able to take down a cruiser but we can agree to disagree on that. Not sure I agree with dreads... because in my opinion you are either skirmishing or invading... if your going to invade you should have to go all out. If you are skirmishing then the challenge of the attacker is preventing the defender from bringing their full force to bear(hence the reason I agree with your blops idea)... but again we can agree to disagree.
---
QA ratio is bad. I've worked in corporate investment banking and we didn't have a single QA. QA is the failure of a company to promote clean code + code review + code testing practices.
---
The truth cannot be silenced!!!!!!
---
Except with threats and money...mostly.
---
&gt;CCP rules are based on unfair advantage

You linked this post a week ago so you should know better.

So your common sense is stronger than OP's common sense and fact's are irrelevant?

I've quite enjoyed some of the other events but this one truly sucks for multiple reasons, most of which others have covered but for some reason this one just felt soulless as well.

you can remotely redeem plex to your plex vault, where they become inaccessible to the game world while you travel to wherever it is you want to drop them onto the market

How are you even smart enough to have a cushy office job where you can pretend to work? How did you get that job?

&gt; because in my opinion you are either skirmishing or invading...
---
Here is one big problem. Blobs use titans and supers to defense their farmers' everyday farm. Dreadbombs used to be the single counter to that, but not anymore because blobs have enough faxes now. Meanwhile attackers can't use titans/supers unless they deployed their own keepstar or their super fleet is bigger than the defending fleet. That means you can either full scale invade a region, or can't do anyhting to disrupt the farm. And that means as long as it remains uninvaded, the largest blob will merely expontentially grow. Since nobody can keep invasions up, there will be an inevitable point where this exponential growht happens. So that happened to Goons. This is what I mean when I say game mechanics let Goons win.

Yeah cool be offended

This is data from January. I know people tend to associate what's happening right now with data because people like to connect dots in their heads, but if the exodus is the cause of that data, it's people who left the game a while ago.

some general, quick tips for scanning: 
---
**the fit**
---
Heron has: 
---
5 mids, leaving 2 for analyzers, 1 for compact 5mwd, 2 for the scan (i think it's rangefinding) array. Alphas can only use the two t1 arrays for time and range, use both free slots for range, this will give you a 18.7% scan strength bonus. 
---
2 highs, one for probe launcher, one for cloak. no probs if you can't use cloak, no probs if scanner is t1, but use **sisters probes** as even as they are expensive, they give a huge bonus to scanning. Do some highsec explo first and you will be good to get an astero in a day or two. as you upgrade your gear, get a sisters probe launcher too for 20mils. never forget the drones after you scan! --&gt; recall is a must.
---
**the scan**
---
\- Always launch probes as pinpoint.
---
\- always start at 8 LY as a newbie. Then go to 2, then 0.5. After getting to 0.25,  You can reduce probes range keeping ctrl or alt pressed, can't remember which one it is, but try it :) 
---
\- **clicking on an anom before centering probes each time will center the screen on that anom**, making it easy to zoom and place probes at exactly the core of the anom
---
**useful tips**
---
\- If you scan an anom at 8 LY for ex and it moves, but stays with an X, center it again and use the same range to scan again. 
---
\- if you scan an anom with 8 LY for ex and it splits into two dots, scan both dots at 2 LY, separately. (reduce the probe range and scan each) 
---
\- the farther you are from market hubs, the bigger the chances to get sites in system. 
---
\- the closer you are to sansha space, the better the loot, but rarer. Guristas or serpentis give second best loot, but they are much less hunted by other explorers. search each specific space, see where you do best and establish your ops there. 
---
\- even with a heron, you would do great in null, with a good alliance to protect the space. Join karmafleet or test for best exploring results. 
---
\- my name is the same as in game. send me a mail and i will reply with heron fits and further on when you need them (astero, t2, stratios, etc)
---
good luck! :)

(Saw this on App Store. This game is totally not inspired by EVE. /s)
---
Ahhh, mobile p2w microtransaction hell inspired by EvE. What else could one want? :D
---
&gt; holy shit... the insides of stations are actually interesting 
---
I feel you. It's an unpopular opinion, but I actually liked Captain's Quarters. Sure, it might have been pointless, but it was comfy and super relaxing to just walk around in between fleets or sit on the couch doing project discovery or whatever. I hope they make some kind of out-of-ship content at some point. It doesn't even have to be anything amazing, but there's so much they could do with citadel interiors.
---
I don‚Äôt have an answer on stuff so specific no. You don‚Äôt either. I just decide not to make one up. Your ‚Äúdata points‚Äù are garbage in garbage out.

Being scarwd of losing your "shit" is the mentality of why eve sucks balls now.

Try using a set of SOE core scanner probes and don't forget about the small gravity capacitor upgrade rigs.

It's as if you have a set of general rules for third party programs and a detailed set of rules for input broadcasting. Hmm.

What consequences mean exactly is for ccp to decide. But if they wanted to say unfair advantage they would of said so, like in the case of third party programs.

---
Again, that is exactly where you are partly wrong. Yes, all every plex was once bought from CCP. 
---
It's important that there are two types of RL money buyers: 
---
1. buy sth specific, with variable sum of $
---
2. invest a specific sum in $
---
Without RMT/botters you would have this case:
---
RL money buyer -&gt; plex buyer ingame = "direct" isk transfer, 100% of the value goes to either of the player.
---
With RMTers it's the following:
---
RL money buyer -&gt; RMT/botter -&gt; RMT plex buyer RL = indirect isk transfer. Now, a common misconception, is that the prices of plex in isk are the same in both cases (yes, most claim it to be related but then ignore it in the calculation how it affects CCP). This is obviously not the case, the price gets inflated, as botters pump more isk into the system, inflate the plex prices and sell it to RMT plex buyers. For type 1. plex $ buyer, this means less plex influx, due to less plex needed to buy the specific thing. For type 2 plex buyer, it is irrelevant. Inflated plex prices therefore HURT ccp. 
---
Your thinking that more isk/plex causes more sales is pretty much wrong. The system is very much elastic. players who do not want to spend $ on the game will most likely not, and players who do spend $, decide often how much they want/can spend. Players don't want 15titans, just because it's now as cheap as it used to be for 1 titan...
---
At least regarding the Titans, you have no idea how off you are from the reality :D

Thanks you for this info, i will deffinetly put this to use when i finished work today.
---
Technically, yes. Core have 40 base strength and Combat have 20. But the scan range for combat probes is double that of the core, so the effective strength is the same.
---
That being said, I'd still be recommending newbros use core probes as it is a pain to fit a combat probe launcher on an exploration frigate.
---
I will keep that in mind, thank you.

33k Players we see via stats "actively" logged in. Can we agree on that point.  
---
SO.... using JUST THAT... and also assuming they were all OMEGA ACCOUNTS (Which i fucking made clear i was being "Generous" on...well i typed the words but you dumb fucks are on this autistic screeching loop and are too busy racing to cherry pick every data point to suite some god fucking knows agenda that has no point... you use that data to use as a guestimate on potential likely revenue per month... just a simple random data sampling point to infer "WORST case" with a mix of optimism (ie OMEGA)...thats the baseline...or tide mark it won't go below.  
---
Now this is the part where you break out into an autistic screech loop as if somehow you figured out the maximum and say "fuck your baseline, this is the number" in so many words and well here we are... looping on a point that despite all the data points that were presented you're like "fuck no , this one right here...this is my moment to shine"
---
Thats the part where i just tune out and think "I get it, i get what it must feel like to be the smart ones in the movie idiocracy..." ...so...yes...that data you state is what plants crave ....welcome to starbucks, i love you.  
---
WORST....worst...case...not best case...WORST... and with generosity built in for omega 100% ...because again..nobody has the ratio split on Omega/Alpha.
---
FUCK ME... 
---
So can I buy this orrr 
---
weird, I've always felt scanning with core probes to go quicker. maybe it was all in the power of suggestion

"If we want to count alphas, **we could lop off 20%** which is quite generous"

Not sure why Seb's posting others' losses, and even then this Leshak loss of mine happened before your post was made. (I'd be lying if I said I didn't even consider posting the loss here to be smug about it)

The "subcap-only" limitation is a weird one: Capitals are just one type of cancer among countless other options to make sure you don't lose a fight.

And as usual, that Leshak loss was my fault alone, I could've just left after booshing the battleships off my face once. :)

eve is(was) a good game [at it's core]. It's the developers who've done significant damage to it.
---
If you do high tier abyssals they should be far more profitable. However that requires billions in ships and fittings up front, and carries a high risk of loss.

Assuming that you know the proper procedure for scanning what you're concerned with is your probe strength. You can find this out in a few ways. The easiest is to hover your mouse over your probe launcher when it has probes loaded, but not yet launched. The number can be anything from about 50-100.
---
As you're scanning a SIG, once you get past (IIRC) 25% scanned down, it will tell you the level of the SIG. Level I is easiest. Level V is very rare and the hardest to scan down. A level III requires about 65 scan strength. A IV about 70-75 and a level V higher. If you don't have enough scab strength then simply put you can't scan down these sigs.
---
From memory, to increase probe strength:
---
* Train the appropriate skills. One is Astrometrics, there's another I can't remember, under the scanning section.
---
* Use the gravity capacitor rigs.
---
* Use the scan range finding module.
---
* Training the corresponding skill for the frigate. So if you're in a Heron, training Caldari Frig skill, etc.
---
* Implants (generally expensive and not too useful).
---
If you're really stuck, feel free to message me in game (same name), I can help you out with fittings.

So you're saying Eve will live forever? 
---
TL;DR
---
&gt; Here are the current numbers just as we‚Äôre passing the half way point of this quarter: 
---
&gt; * 1350 account bans for account hacking.  
---
&gt; * 4102 account bans for botting related activities.  
---
&gt; * 1205 account bans for RMT related activities.  
---
...
---
&gt; After investigating further, the decision has been made to place all level 4 and 5 missions behind the requirement to have Omega status, to assist the fight against RMT and botting.
---
&gt; [Same-old spiel about 2FA and reporting bots.]
---
I'm really uncomfortable with the fact that the video got censored. I mean, by taking it down, CCP probably did more harm than the video, because they showed that they don't like that opinion and took it down. I am thinking about unsubing since quite a moment now, and CCP probably convinced me more than the video.
---
I don't want to be part of a game that censors voices just because they don't like what is said. Everyone is free to tell how they feel about the game, may it be positive of negative, and very often, the most negative feels are those of people who are the most passionate about the game and just want to enjoy it again.
---
Moral of the story, ggwp CCP, you made me hate you a little bit more just because you are douches. 
---
AFAIK those numbers are cumulative since the last security updates, so it means since a months. So it means in the month in between the 2 updates there was :
---
- 888 account bans for account hacking.
---
- 2151 account bans for botting related activities.
---
- 624 account bans for RMT related activities.
---
They say don't harbor or rent to these botters because they'll "clean you out".
---
Yet there has been clearly documentated cases, not to mention actual bans against some accounts in alliances and yet nothing?
---
&gt;After investigating further, the decision has been made to place all level 4 and 5 missions behind the requirement to have Omega status, to assist the fight against RMT and botting.
---
that's about 500 pcu hit eve will take 
---
That has been the same a year ago. All Gurista ships don't have the drone bandwidth to launch a full set of drones (compareable to the hull size). But the two drones they can launch don't only do much more DPS than normal drones but also have much more EHP. The bonus of the Gila puts the DPS of the two mediums into similar dimensions as five heavies. Two Hammerheads on an Gila deal 380 DPS while five Ogres on an unbonused hull deal 317 DPS (475 on a VNI). After you fitted 3 DDAs you have very nice damage. Remember that the mediums are also now as tanky as heavies but still have the application and speed of mediums!
---
lowsec is still fine for solo small ship fun and cheap t1 roams - you won't get blobbed too much and even if you are it's not a big loss.
---
you can go FW - to find relevant corps just use zkill and pick whatever faction you fancy. For example to see current amarr active corps you would look at this [https://zkillboard.com/faction/500003/](https://zkillboard.com/faction/500003/)
---
or you can go pirate and kill both sides. you can't make money by plexing/missions this way but you have twice as many people to fight. Again, check zkill for relevant pirate corps in the area you want to move. In Amarr/minmatar wz I'd recommend Schneckt if they're still alive, they're a good bunch.
---
stock up on tristans, tormentors, breachers, dragoons, coercers and thrashers. later upgrade to faction frigs for wider engagement profile or use gimmicky out of meta fits. Farm clone soldiers in 0.2 for isk.
---
they negwallet the revenue for each account caught, but fail to realize that even if they catch half of all bots, the other half are easily making a ton of revenue for the alliance
---
not that that is an issue, it's not the job of the players to police botters or rmters 
---
stay away from other germans in EVE 
---
trust me on this one 
---
*Wooo* It's your **7th Cakeday** suitonia! ^(hug)

Well, theres more than one way to skin a cat.
---
You illegally access an account and transfer the funds to either your or an RMT purchasers account. Liquidate everything as fast as you can and you can be gone in minutes, especially with the Multi Sell feature. I assume the bans refer to beneficiaries of the funds or items.
---
I experienced what you describe. Several seconds of module lag in the Abyss, never outside of it. Just one of the three rooms lags behind, go through the gate and it clears up mostly.  This PC isn't brand new, but a 1060 isn't breaking into a sweat when running Eve. I usually get around 60FPS when playing. 
---
It's for fighting other players. This fit is only for defending, but you can easily modify it to have a scram and go hunting other explorers.
---
It is way too weak for the sleeper sites, even in a C1. You could run up to 3/10 DED sites in HS with this fit.
---
nice trigger =D
---
Awesome, all hail the tormentor!! 
---
hello @ccp just before dt i killed a botting nyx and it was his 3rd botting nyx loss in 3 months, how is it possible that they are not banned
---
Or it's players for that matter.
---
they banned my alt three days ago because i extracted a bunch of skills and they thought it was hacked. only got it back yesterday, good thing it was only my alt and i wasn't planning on doing anything with it during that time
---
And yet you can still see [shit like this](https://puu.sh/CNITO/8589cca12b.jpg) in every other system in Fraternity in Wicked Creek. 
---
And before anyone asks, yes I've reported them.
---
Can you include a ticker in the OP on how many Mar5hy threads have been taken down?
---
you dont have to be goons to realize what a tool he can be now and then 
---
With the level 4 and 5 mission change to omega only, won't that just push bots into another part of the game?
---
Are these missions a high isk source for bots?
---
Keep whacking the moles (i.e. bots) CCP!
---
Should be an anti-tractorbeam type turret to legally push intruders outside of structure / belt range.
---
Could be useful in lowsec as well.. push people from engagement range. :)
---
I did the maths on this last year when this first happened and for a hundred bucks more than that you could have had yearly subscriptions to Eve for the entire time it has existed.
---
There are 2x security analysts validating the bots so I‚Äôm gonna guess they are likely in a queue .. GMs are apparently only able to act if it‚Äôs live at the time.. so that‚Äôs an issue in itself as if you can‚Äôt flag down a GM live then it‚Äôs probably a data analysis moment there after..
---
They were but recently left. They are no longer a member. They left to join panfam via evicting inhabitants of cobalt edge. /went well/
---
[:slight_smile:](https://i.imgur.com/nzkYHaj.png)
---
Considering their business model is to promise every feature ever wanted in every space opera game ever, this is kind of impressive.
---
There's a lot of other angles to look at here - automated mining, anomoly botting, all manner of stuff.
---
This is one step in a long term plan to kick people who're botting and RMTing square in the balls.
---
These are numbers for Q1 - 2019.01.01 through until the time and date of the publishing of the blog.
---
A month ago, we had a c4 shattered in the chain.
---
I wanted to try to leave solo with my two main accounts plus an orca that i'll used as a mobile base so i moved there for a week.
---
On the third day a hole opens, and a tengu followed by combat probes appeared.
---
Luckily, the orca was cloaked in a safe pots.
---
I quickly scan the new hole, and it's a c6.
---
And the tengu is a HK one, as they had recently moved to the C2/0.0-C6, I guess they are close by.
---
I suddenly see two occators warping to the HS static which is 6 jump away from jita.
---
I quickly reship my main with a sabre and I cloak it on the C6 hole while the scout in a proteus is on the HS.
---
There is more than 14 Au between both hole so i hope i can catch one of them on the way back.
---
Both ships are in positions and i know they don't have scout in the sytem.
---
I wait a bit. I hear a hole activation and decloak the saber and bubbles up.
---
Nothing decloak on  the HS... and suddenly a Mastodon appears on the C6 hole.... In other words I fucked up.
---
So I warps out the sabre and lay low for some time while they keep on doing their logistics with a retribution on each hole.
---
Then I decided to rat in the sytem where the anoms where out of dscan range of both holes. So i the ended up doing C3 sites for 1h30 in a loki with HK doing Logistics in the same systems as me :p
---
It's a pretty manual process right now, but solid automation is in progress.
---
It's all about trying to keep the number of false positives to a minimum so we don't screw with genuine players.
---
It happens from time to time, but we're trying to get better at resolving it as fast as possible.
---
This thread is nice, but it always get unsticked fairly quickly :/
---
&gt; [Same-old spiel about enabling 2FA and reporting bots.]
---
This spiel is often underestimated, and helps a hell of a lot with keeping the number of these cases down.
---
I see 2 things happening.
---
1. LP value will go up
---
2. the LP/h of L3 Missions are shit, which means it is no longer profitable to run them as alpha
---
I'll be interested in seeing how ccp handles that without screwing over legitimate players.
---
Are you retarded? Goals can be subjective. Not only that, the measurement is that his success rate goes down on stealing excavators.
---
i am aware, i'm just thinking if it's the former then it overlaps directly with their third statistic
---
good news, morale is up
---
This discord is already making me want to grab an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription and start re-learning some video editing skillz haha
---
I'll be honest, when i scraped over the CCP numbers (again via LinkedIn)... and realised actually the size of the company it became a shock in a lot of ways... i don't know i've never stopped to ask "How many people in CCP and what do they work on" as i just always assumed a AAA like game structure as Eve given its size would be upwards of 10,000 employees world wide give or take (factoring in marketing and what not).  
---
Then ... 2x Analysts and in your case 1x Community manager.... Ooooh... fuck me.... so you're effectively processing approx 200 accounts an hour would be my best guess... so automation would be critical?  
---
One thing you could do, is inject false memories ... its clear the bots use memory reading to determine events/triggers but that doesn't mean necessarily the human has to see the result. So like if you found a bot, you inject a fake packet that triggers a reaction..if bot reacts then its a case of "But how'd you know that?...as humans rely on sight..you relied on other means....ban"  
---
Something to that effect. 
---
[removed]
---
That's the challenge, and that's why stuff like this takes time :) 
---
Hmm.... The thing that bugs me is that they have space ships and all that futuristic tech but they still use electric/gas man operated forklifts? WTF? Oh nice drift on that forklift in the back. No wonder tho the ground must be really slippery and unsafe to work on.
---
Like it makes grinding isk the hard way feel so useless. Why am I bothering when botters can make billions a day with almost zero risk?
---
Structures can only shoot at WTs. I have heard that they can also shoot when the operator, target and structure are in same corp and friendly fire is legal (but if the structure is in different corp in same alliance it can not shoot at other alliance members).
---
The structure can not shoot at suspects or criminals.
---
Not sure if sarcasm. 
---
To be honest, I'd love to see "shark week" to be the regular state of this sub. Low effort shitposting and karma whoring is the main reason I stopped coming here on a daily basis.

Lol. Your example is terrible. What if you came out to your car and saw olmeca standing there with a knife and your 4 tires and a spare slashed.
---
Goon SIG lul
---
Salt Farmers are a German lowsec group in Black Rise. They used to run a public fleet each Monday -- I don't know if that's still a thing, didn't fly with them any more since I joined Brave.
---
Even shorter TL;DR
---
Still no visible incentives for enabling 2FA
---
Still no way to disable skillpoint extraction without deliberately getting yourself banned
---
Genuine question: are a lot of botters doing l4 missions? I know someone who has an alpha account and runs l4's once a week or so and that's the only way they play eve, so I'd guess anyone doing similar doesn't contribute to the game or Ccp's bottom line really but just wondering how many legit players (rarely logging in) will be affected
---
The 0.1% broker fees just are not enough considering the fact that I have to trust other players to protect my stuff. 
---
I was hoping this would be some new neat details about the conflict there between the russians/test/etc and frat/skillu, since an actual war in SP is rare and the conflict in question is shaping up to be really interesting. Or at least an AAR from one of the recent fights there which gives some of those details.
---
Instead it's a 1.5/10 tier roleplay meme. You guys didn't fight the last time frat booted you from SP and you memed about it then too. At least fight back first before you meme about it this time.
---
I used to be in a WH corp back in 2014-2016.
---
One day we were roaming around in a WH chain looking for content (4 man gang). We only came across a catalyst with some nice sleeper salvage and blue loot in it so we decided to pop him.
---
He then got super salty in local and said he will contract a merc group to track us down and evict us. We didn't really think he would go on and keep his word so we just laughed at him and moved on. Turns out he did.
---
So one day we wake up and our stick is surrounded by bubbles etc. So we contact the guys to ask what is happening. Turns out they were contacted by that salty guy. We talked with them got to know them and we persuaded them to evict that guy.
---
1 week goes by and we hear from the salty guy who got even saltier after he got evicted.
---
Yeah. not a great story but I am not sure if this could happen in many other games.
---
yes I have about 400 hours exclusively playing germany liberating europe
---
Your incentive for enabling 2FA is to not have your account stolen and fucked 
---
Pearl Abyss is Korean, not Chinese. Interesting that you think EVE will die solely because the company is Asian, though.
---
I'm a little concerned about these reports, and here's why (example is simplified):
---
In our country, local police efficiency is determined by the number of people imprisoned monthly. So, if in January local Moscow PD took down, say, 100 bads, next month better be 101 or more, otherwise your department might be considered problematic and your employees will face a fine. What this leads to is that more and more cases are completely fabricated, and more often than not innocent people get affected by this system. Whole thing is much more complex, but you get the idea.
---
@CCP, please, don't make these reports solely about numbers, make these about quality of takedowns. I'm glad to see the mission running limitation being implemented, please keep on developing tactics that will ruin bothers' lives. Just... make sure you're not going full retard and not affecting innocent capsuleers üôè
---
The call to arms against bots is interesting in the ‚Äúour skeleton crew can‚Äôt do anything, management won‚Äôt let us if we could, please help us and feel involved and don‚Äôt get mad anymore‚Äù sense. 
---
My message was very clear in my head and not clear at all once put through the keyboard, that's what I meant
---
Don‚Äôt worry, the botters war is ahead
---
Dang! I would attend but I'm still on 24/7 arrest huee.
---
Oh well. Have fun y'all. 
---
&gt; It's a pretty manual process right now, but solid automation is in progress.
---
this is the way to go. manually doing it is going to be a long term loser.
---
good job.
---
Is that Spore, Space Engineers, or some off brand mobile app? 
---
&gt;Also removing the POSes finally should help slightly to actually catch these
---
How? By replacing them with tetherable citadels?
---
I‚Äôm sorry are you looking for some kinda in game pat on the back for securing your account? Or am I misreading? 
---
Taking your ccp hat off for the moment...
---
What would you do, or what would you like to see happen?
---
Thank you for replying!
---
Yeh, its easier to setup bubble logoff traps on a raitaru f.e. then a pos with guns.
---
&gt; that's about 500 pcu hit eve will take 
---
It'll be interesting to see if that's the case, and I'll watch for it. Don't call it "PCU", though, that's something different: peak concurrent users. If there is a hit, it will be better reflected in a different metric, daily average logged in players. I am sad there is no good acronym for this. ;-)
---
I measured PCU for years, and it's just not a good metric for much of anything except maybe guestimating the break down of EUTZ players versus USTZ players. It's not a very good metric for estimating botting, some of which are 23/7 and some of which are confined to this or that TZ.
---
what's a "holy rollers"?
---
I have 2FA enabled on everything that has 2FA, hell even discord.  Yes it might be annoying forgetting I'm on a VPN and have to go to my phone or Authy (use this) to put in a code for a certain site.  But know what, it means that 2FA is actually working.
---
Yeah be reasonable. Chris Roberts never underdelivers or goes over budget and time constraints!
---
huh?
---
They should be asking for additional information about you, to identify that it is your account.
---
Thanks, having rolled out MFA services across various SMEs, that small point eluded me /s
---
However, for most people who don't know better, NOT having something happen is not a visible benefit to them, unless it's already happened before.
---
There are two ways of maximising 2FA uptake.
---
1) Make it mandatory.
---
2) Add a visible direct incentive for the end-user.to encourage them to enable it.
---
Personally I usually choose option 1, but as an intro step, option 2 would be an easier sell for CCP.
---
I'd be inclined to agree with a new server in a flash reset. Giving that opportunity bittervets included I think.many might go for that, not that ccp woll do it they already mentioned they wont make another server (read eve is single shard). But I think even newer players would come as well ones already playing and ones not due to what they could do in that server vs what they cannot dream of in this one due to sheer amount of time and assets collected.
---
I'd write more but I have to get to work.
---
Good progress being made. I don't think it's sustainable against the never ending onslaught of new bot accounts but I'm glad CCP is investigating other ways of dealing with this problem.
---
Throw some deep learning at it, seems to work miracles everywhere else.
---
Just sing Holy Diver by Dio and change the words.
---
u/CCP_Falcon In the update there is an appeal to Alliances who rent space not to harbour botters. Over the last year we (INIT.) have been monitoring, kicking and reporting players suspected of botting but when it really comes down to it players have no 100% way to tell if someone is actually breaking the rules. Yes people can be 90% sure but its still not completely sure.  
---
It would be helpful if CCP could supply some further information, to go with the appeal for help, to better help people recognise botters. A "things to watch out for". Help needs to work both ways in this case.
---
True.
---
Running dreads and having a new hole pop right as you enter siege can really get the juices flowing.
---
Wormholes are great.
---
Not to mention when you get a wandering low (move caps in) or high (sell blue loot) feels great. 
---
Wormholes are amazing.
---
Oooo Terminator X: Judgment Day New Eden
---
I like it.
---
A couple of youtubers may have some interesting stuff in their back catalogues; DeLoneWolf has a nice, noob friendly channel with loads of beginner tips. Chance Ravine, WingSpanTT, has a load of scanning stuff in his early vids, as he set off to learn wormholes.   
---
Best bet as a noob is to aim for ships and modules with bonuses, they will help massively - sisters probes and launcher, a racial exploration frigate (magnate or imicus recommended) and try some of the scanning arrays - they re mid slots - pinpointing, range and acquisition (iirc). these will help a lot and the t1 versions are super cheap.  
---
It‚Äôs not really a kick though if it takes forever to connect to the gooch, it becomes a prod, or a poke, I guess. 
---
Meh, i don't think the issues of eve are solely client-side, i just think that's one of many symptoms that lead back to server-side.. so i'm not personally convinced client-side is the penicillin to this issue.
---
The rich man's way is to just slip it under the QOL releases / stability changes coming down the pipe. Makes sense to do this now rather than later.. however you could accidently leave an exploit open so given the QA to Engineer ratios in CCP i'm not sure that's a wise approach given the workload (so yeah..to your question "Who" ...fuck..that's where the $$ need to be spent back into that "team").  
---
The poor mans way is to just leverage the XMPP chat servers and inject  players into certain systems (create NPC corp "players") that randomly teleport into XYZ system. To i'd say majority of Eve players it would just appear someone came from "Safe log" into existence and year our intel channels will light up "PilotXYZ Blah-999 nv" ..but that's moot, because what CCP at that point are doing is fishing the botter (GM's could do this with minimal training). Bots typically go to safety when neut shows up... rinse/repeat and eventually you'll measure reaction times (server side tick timestamps) and narrow in on a likely "botter". So thats when GM / CCP appears in local or maybe privately to said player, prompts them "you there?"...no answer...rinse/repeat... and then that begs the question how does an AFK human react to neuts? 
---
Its trivial shit tbh. 2x Analysts and what about 5-10 GMs atm probably couldn't handle the workload required sadly..so its fucked all round as tbh if CCP are pulling down around 80M per year in revenue (which i don't know to be true and really haven't got the stamina to fight that number) ...then not investing in this area is bad form. As we can weather a lot of shit in this game but i think EULA breachers are where the gamers even on reddit unite
---
Yes, it's classic incentivising positive behaviour. 
---
Alternatively, you could offer a 20% discount on the next purchase of game time, generally anything which realises an immediate benefit to the user, vs the "not being hacked" which, if it's done right, you'd never actually see the results of (because they'd never get into your account).
---
And yes, it's a well studied method, and as it happens Fortnite recently rolled out something very similar: https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/2fa
---
Not getting 20 thousand dollars in debt if I trip and hurt myself is a benefit of having universal health care. That‚Äôs a visible benefit to me.
---
I also have a lock for my locker at work and there have been absolutely zero instances of something going missing here. No one else has locks but I still don‚Äôt fuck around. The security of knowing my assets are more secure is definitely a visible benefit.
---
But yes I honestly don‚Äôt know why it isn‚Äôt mandatory.
---
&gt; I mean skillu has too much space for their size/numbers after today.
---
Imagine thinking we care about space/size ratio or whatever.
---
The kind of people who are going to put a lock on their locker, are not the kind of people who need additional encouragement to enable MFA. 
---
Unfortunately, optional MFA uptake is still pretty low. Google released stats at the tail end of last year saying only 10% of its users use MFA.
---
Personally I'm a fan if Yubikeys. 
---
Well, I can't say that they don't play a big part in a lot of engagements.
---
For the frigate abyssal sites, I've seen that the worm can solo T1s but can it do harder ones? Could anyone share a fit pretty please?
---
Read title, knew it must have been a beam confessor who couldn't track, scimmed the video, was right.  2/10 good job finding 3 bads.   
---
That would be a reading comprehension problem.
---
This is very true... I have recently found 4 systems with smart bombing machies and have yet figured out how to solo kill them due to the POS the retreat to having lasers and scram point...
---
Any ideas on how to kill these guys would be helpful (please pm me).
---
So it's more of the principle of "Rather the guilty go free than let an innocent man in jail", well I can respect that. Still better than some societies...
---
&gt; supply some further information
---
giving any advice to players will be outdated the instant the botters update their bots to work around any specific behaviours mentioned by CCP. 
---
So not giving out specifics is just CCP avoiding an Armsrace they can't win anyway since the playerbase isn't always up-to-date on the news and things just getting really confusing.
---
Is there any work on going to 'rebalance' current afk activities such as drone ratting and rorq mining?
---
It's pretty much the only way to do it. Even if you dedicated 100% of CCP's resources to fighting bots, the fact of the matter is that there will always be more people trying to break the rules than there will be those trying to enforce them. Automation is basically the only way forward.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
Holy shit, someone who actually understands that PCU is a crap metric.
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98584538/
---
I've been killing VNI bots for 2 months now in WC, some of them a LOT of times. Reported them all.
---
They are still there.
---
At this point I think there are 3 options:
---
1. CCP knows about them but for some unknown reason tolerates them.
---
2.CCP knows about them but can not stop them. 
---
3. CCP does not care.
---
All options are scary. 
---
Eh, it doesn't cost anything for them to say it. If it reaches just one person's ears, it's effort well spent. I say this as someone who is staunchly opposed to being responsible for policing botting activity as a player.
---
Fuck yeah you are right falcon. Corp mate recently got hacked. Asked for 2FA. Nope... RIP money and SP
---
Ccp and ex ccp made it go away, for the good of the people.
---
Yeah as I was typing my initial comment I realised that but I continued anyway. If they are going to appeal to Alliance (Leaders) and kinda threaten them in the same sentence then there needs to be more substantial information given to help players combat botters. What that information is or how it looks its really up to CCP, just help us help you.
---
&gt;Read title, knew it must have been a beam confessor
---
My thoughts exactly, he didnt even need AB just orbit 500 and beams cant hit. 
---
ya but it's the only information we're given right?
---
can only go with what we're given
---
If you think Eve is bad just wait til you see the Netease mobile version of it!

You can put rigs and modules on your ship to improve your scan strength.

Even though i will get negative karma with this post, let me tell you something:  
---
The only thing you have done with this post, is to promote his stream, and actually, thats kinda a nice thing. I've been watching his stream for a week now, and to be honest, i didn't even notice the rmt with his "Raider Points", cause i didn't even have a look at it.  
---
What i can tell you so far: As soon as he noticed it was illegal to do so, he imediatly changed the shop, so there is no chance to exchange real money to his currency. And within the week i have been watching, not a single person exchanged real money to his raider points. The only thing thats left, is his loyality system, which is, as far as i can tell, not illegal.   
---
I don't know his background, and to be honest, i do not care. All of us have done something bad, and are not in the position of blaming someone for his past.   
---
His content is chill, and thats what i have been looking for.   
---
Feel free to join the stream and drop a follow. As many of you guys have already done last night.
---
Cause someone actually is ratting for 18 - 23 hours on a day, nope no way at all for players to be 100% certain. 
---
CCP‚Äôs a fuck, and I will always be a vocal critic of their management. That being said, I‚Äôd rather people report a few false positives here and there - showing that they‚Äôre doing *something* - than never hearing any real world proof that the shit they claim is actually happening. It sucks, and they have to get better quickly, but I‚Äôd rather they flag an alt as hacked and have it not be true than have one be hacked and completely missed, forcing me to report it to them.
---
i dont mind that they banned it but i emailed them as soon as it happened, i wish they'd have sorted it out more quickly
---
Obviously we don't have numbers but botters can make enough in a single day to Omega, are alphas this rampant for level 4 and 5 missions? I know a good handful of people who use alphas for mission pulling. 
---
This just seems like a way for CCP to continue chasing that PA cash bonus by forcing bots into becoming monthly subscribers. 
---
I still play eve, but my love for the game is fading, doesn‚Äôt have the same fun factor as it once had for me
---
Eh, it's more that he has an agenda -- he hates the video game and wants it to fail. Nothing he says, or will ever say, is genuine or in the interest of anyone who actually enjoys the video game. It's basically a conniption fit over being banned that's lasted for half a decade or more.
---
I installed the Gimp again last night. That's not a euphemism. 
---
F
---
No, an infinite point.
---
"growing drifter activity"
---
They keep saying it, I never see it.
---
When are CCP finally going to do something with the AI they spent ages developing?
---
It might finally help make Eve's pve experience fun enough that they decide they want to do it instead of mindless botting.
---
I liked your post, Jibrish is an asshole :pensive:
---
You do realize the spawned super or titan would need to be much tougher than they are now? They are a cash loot pinata that just takes a minute or two to kill.
---
"Who're botting"... LOL!
---
Do alliances get notified when they are supporting bots? 
---
Do alliance leaders get responses to the bot reports they submit?
---
How does this work exactly? 
---
Lol wut
---
&gt;but solid automation is in progress.
---
After 16 years, are you sure it's not too soon? Maybe if we just "wait and see"? It worked so well in the past.
---
I believe it when I "see" it.
---
Speaking as a member of Evictus, the response is on point.

No argument here. Unfortunately it‚Äôs literally two people and maybe some GMs hand reviewing each case. Big yikes

Yeah... I really don't understand all this "lore" when it doesn't mean fuck all for the game 99% of the time.
---
He harbors yachts, not bots
---
If they do that, people who help the bots and rmters will just related the info to the botters on how to dodge rules even further than they already are. 
---
1.) this dumbass rose tinted lenses shit about people being more risk averse in EVE today is seriously obnoxious as well as wrong. More shit dies on a daily basis today than any time in the last 15 years.
---
2.) there‚Äôs no winning in this kind of gated PvP only area. If there‚Äôs nothing to gain, I might as well just fucking buy plex with my isk and right-click trash them after buying them. Jfc.
---
" If you‚Äôre an alliance or coalition leader, don‚Äôt harbour these people. If you‚Äôre renting space to an alliance, don‚Äôt rent to people who‚Äôre botting."  
---
This is funny.
---
The thing  I love is even the alliances openly opposed to botting have botters that they know about. As a example, BOT alliance, had a "strat" level op to save a 1 man corp structure that was in low power. 
---
damn, hope my nick won't be taken for a bot
---
We need a list of all banned in-game names so we can verify.
---
It's always based on following threads and trying to go up the chain of botting/rmt to catch as many of them as possible from 1 ban wave. That would be the only logical sense to why many of the bots are not banned on the spot or even after a couple of months. Nine Nine machine wasn't banned/burned even after 3+ months of reports of him super botting and rmting via sky's bot farm. He eventually became permanently inactive at the end of last year. 
---
whoops, wrong sub. mods delete please /u/Jibrish ... i'm dumb
---
&gt;After looking at usage metrics, it became apparent that there was a need to establish a clearer set of folders relevant to activities in EVE, as well as reducing the number of unanchored icons (icons that are outside any folder).  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;To do this, **we took a few factors into consideration, including the most commonly used windows in the client and the most popular activities in New Eden**.
---
this is a recent example. 
---
We all know the real reason is that they want their micro-transactions to be more prominent in the UI

I think CCP increased the number of concurrent drifter wormholes ("unidentified wormhole"). I saw a drifter wormhole with ~100 exits inside.
---
Tax doesn't matter for traders.
---
Bigger tax just means a bigger gap between the buy orders and sell orders, but in a competitive market, the profit margin per item will stay low in either case.
---
Imagine thinking you would actually undock for the content you created. See you girls soon.

And that's why plex is the only item not traded mainly in Jita.

I've been meaning to put my favourite EvE experience into writing for some time now but never got around to it - so here goes. Please note that this is from my perspective only, as a pleb line pilot I may have some details wrong but I have endeavoured to be as correct as possible.
---
**The twin battles of 77S8-E**
---
Background and era: Back in 2014 the majority of nullsec was held by three major alliances and their rental empires: Goons, Pandemic Legion, and N3. Jump fatigue didn't exist back then and with unrestricted movement supercapital fleets could move on cyno chains from one end of their empire to another in a matter of minutes, effectively smothering any would-be upstart nullsec entities hoping to establish a foothold in their area of control.
---
In response to this overwhelming control and stagnation of nullsec, CCP introduced the 'jump fatigue' mechanic, at a stroke removing the unfettered mobility of the supercapital fleets and in doing so, removing their control of so much space. Almost overnight new nullsec dwellers decended upon the now undefended space, renters who hadn't realised the gig was up and that their overlords either couldn't or wouldn't defend them from the encroaching hordes were left to the tender mercies of the invaders, some would strike deals with their new overlords in exchange for remaining in their space, many more would fire sale and evacuate as the rental space infrastructure around them was torched to make way for the new occupants.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irsXeU98FPE) is a sovereignty vid from the era, watch from around the six minute mark and you can see exactly when jump fatigue hit.
---
In response to the jump fatigue changes, each major empire dealt with it in their own way. Pandemic Legion sold their rental empire wholesale to Legion of xxDeathxx, I'm not sure what Goons did but by the look of the sov map they sold their southern holdings to N3 and contracted to areas closer to home, and N3 tried to hold onto the remains of their rental empire even if they knew they would not be able to hold all of it forever. In persuit of this, minor alliances were brought into the areas close to N3 rental areas and in exchange for space of their own, they were tasked with holding and defending N3 rental areas.
---
Gentlemens Club was one of these minor alliances.
---
In exchange for Immensea and Tenerifis, GClub was tasked with preventing the Russians, Dream Fleet and Red Alliance from spreading further into southern Detorid.
---
Over several months from late 2014 into early 2015 GClub did just that, mostly by way of 'defensive reinforcing' TCUs and stations to keep them in GClubs timezone. Occasionally the Russians would alarm clock to contest timers, sometimes winning, sometimes not, sometimes showing up too late, but as the campaign dragged on inevitably systems were lost either due to direct conflict, or a missed timer.
---
77S8-E was the gateway system to Tenerifis, capitals could not jump the gap to 46DP-O and had to jump through the gate directly to enter Tenerifis - this was a huge risk for any Russian fleet as if things went awry, they could not jump back into the relative safety of Detorid, at this time Supercapitals could also not take gates so a Russian fleet would be without their super support if they decided upon a direct assault through the 46DP-O gate.
---
Either way, the Russians needed to secure 77S8-E as a jumping off point before attacking into Tenerifis directly. They knew it, we knew it, and while we controlled it 77S8-E was the most closely guarded of all the southern Detorid systems.
---
**The First battle of 77S8-E**
---
The Russians had managed to secure both the shield and armour timers on the 77S8-E station, only the hull timer remained so for both sides it was do-or-die. We either had to win the hull timer or the station would be lost, and once lost we would have no chance to regain it.
---
For GClub the station could be secured a number of ways, either repair the shields back above 25%, or destroy one of the three SBUs in system in order to make the station invulnerable again.
---
I was one of about twenty repping chimeras, our job was merely to pump shields into the station while the battle raged around us, we were told not to use triage and under no circumstances were we to take any hostile actions including repping friendly ships for fear of giving ourselves an aggression timer and locking ourselves out of the station for the duration, this would make us sitting ducks for the Russians titans which we knew were on standby for such an event.
---
We also fielded a subcap fleet of Eagles and Tengus with scimitar support, highly mobile yet lacking the needed punch against the Russian staple fleet of sentry Dominixs with Archon triage support.
---
As soon as the timer ended on the station all Chimeras began to cycle reps, the Russians were quick to respond, warping in their Dominix fleet to 50km or so off the station, they dropped sentries and began focusing their firepower on the station, GClubs subcap fleet began to work on the Dominixs but with triage support it was very tough going to make any significant progress into their numbers.
---
Seeing as they controlled the battlefield and not being able to break the reps of the Chimera ball perched on the dock of the station, the Russians brought in five dreadnoughts to bolster their firepower on the objective - this had the desired effect and what had started as a gradual increase in the stations shields was turned into a gradual decrease, slowly down through the repaired shield, then starting to eat into the armour of the station, itself only at 25% as this was a hull timer.
---
Recognising that GClub had lost control of the battlefield at the station, a change of tactics was needed, the subcap fleet warped to the 46DP-O gate and began hitting the SBU there, cynoing in two Moros dreadnaughts to try to destroy it quickly, realising the danger the Russians scooped all their drones, made sure their triage was out and warped off to the 46DP-O gate to remove the threat. 
---
Landing on the SBU the Russians quickly set themselves up, launching sentry drones and entering triage again to repair the SBU, now at about 40% armour - GClubs subcap fleet again tried to contest but could not project enough damage to seriously trouble the Russian fleet, instead concentrating on volleying sentry drones before they could be pulled to safety.
---
The two Moros at the SBU were doomed, and they knew it, overheating and pushing as much damage into the SBU before they fell - under triage reps however, it was an impossible task.
---
Back at the station a peculiar pantomime was taking place, on one side was the twenty Chimeras pumping shields into the station, on the other was the five Russian dreadnaughts blazing away trying to bring them down - and the dreadnaughts were winning, the station was now at 60% structure and still falling.
---
Suddenly the call came over comms to the Chimera ball: *'Pull drones, pull drones! Launch fighters! Launch fighters! Primary is the Naglfar!'*
---
The cloud of rep drones that had surrounded the station suddenly condensed onto the chimeras, there was a brief pause then a huge ball of fighters began swarming towards the hapless Naglfar tearing through its shields and into its armour in seconds - the Russians had made a critical error and it was about to cost them dearly.
---
The Dominix fleet that the Russians had brought was powerful, potent firepower mixed with a heavy armour buffer, the only downside was that it was slow and unwieldy, while the Triage carriers were engaged they were immobile for five minutes at a time, even once out of triage and ready to warp GClub interdictors were keeping their fleet bubbled at the SBU, by the time they had managed to extract themselves from the bubbles and warp back to station they arrived on the field just in time to watch their fifth and final dreadnaught explode. The shields were climbing again past 18%, 19%, 20% and were now at a dangerously high level for the Russians, once 25% shields had been repped the station would reinforce again.
---
Now with insufficient firepower to overcome the Chimera ball the Russians had one more card up their sleeve, a cyno went up 100km off the station and nine Nyxes materialised in flashes of red - fighter bombers screaming forth from their bays in a final attempt to bring the shields down, the Chimeras overheated all their reps as the shields crept past 23%.... 24%.... the fighter bombers were spreading out now, it would be only seconds before their powerful volleys landed on the station ending this once and for all, the shields ticked into 25% and the station instantly went invulnerable as the fibos opening volleys closed out the battle. We had won!
---
There was 3 systems with these in, all created on the same day, all instawarping when you enter system. 
---
If CCP did take it down, how could they? Slander or something?
---
Please do
---
You could also just give your corpies the tools to thrive in what they want to do. By allowing them to make their own narritives they become content creators themselves. As a CEO its not our role to create but to make sure people who do have the tools in place to help them with this and people to guide them if required. They also have to fail. Its how we learn. By allowing them to run with a idea means others will also step up.
---
Did they just ask him to take it down? Pay him? Or was it through the copyright system?
---
&gt;Is input broadcasting okay then? 
---
yes, certain forms of input broadcasting has always been okay.
---
Dunno if that's so much better. Theran Alliance leader is also pretty much a  douche. 
---
I just hope newbros will realize and join a real newbro corp. Or find their luck elsewhere. Exploiting newbros is not acceptable.
---
True enough, I'll give you that.

How is it possible https://zkillboard.com/kill/67209490/ is not banned? False positive I bet?
---
You're on reddit... do you expect everything to be 100% true as well? Look just send me some isk and I'll be sure to double it for you! :)
---
"The opposite of love is not hate, but indifference"
---
remember when CCP spent over a year making drifter incursions that only lasted a month and were incredibly broken and giving isk to all 255 people in fleet, pretty much paying out 200 bil an hour to all involved participants?
---
Why is mar5hy not banned then ccp. He is obviously cheating. Why not do the obvious ones first. 
---
i logged in once
---
aar from a recent fight?  literally nothing has happened.

As El Jefe's CEO. I would like to apologize for El Jefe's actions on my Behalf.

However, this will not be the case.   
---
\#ElJefeforScaldingPass2019!!!!!  
---
I too am going to ask people to monitor every system, 24 hours a day, every day of the week and ask them to ensure they monitor every single person ratting and keep records of their time.  
---
Fuck, if it was that simple then why don't CCP just ban everyone that gets wallet ticks every 20 minutes for 18 to 24 hours straight.
---
A nice tip, if you scan at 4 AU and place the box between the sig and the closest celestial, you can begin to scan it down. Nice tip I use instead of starting at 8 au
---
Because the logs maybe proofe it was not a bot? 
---
Show me on this rorqual where mar5hy touched you
---
Throwing rocks out of the glass house huh?
---
What is input broadcasting? I tried to find some information about it, but all I found was people talking about multiboxing. 
---
Isn't multiboxing just having multiple eve clients open to interact with?
---
I quit the game months ago, RMT'd 2900bil on my way out, and not one of my 45 accounts is banned.
---
Damn, almost like in the real world
---
Also when you reach 0.25 AU try using alt button and moving probes a bit - this can give you few additional percents
---
&gt; We‚Äôll come for the ISK and assets, and you‚Äôll end up cleaned out.

Does this apply to the people KWG are paying?
---

TRUE LOL

I think your American Sign-Language to English translator messed up 
---
Not your best, but I'll still upvote for a laugh first thing in the morning
---
shark week over.  back to shit posts again.  :(
---
That's why it would need a damage cap. Basically - you want to run havens or sanctums with your Hel? Ok, then you get a capital spawn that gives you decent loot but you have to stay there for 15-20 minutes fighting it while being unable to warp out. No moonwalking out because you're running anoms while aligned.
---
Yup, this. It‚Äôs like a drug bust. You‚Äôre not gonna catch the head of a cartel lord by busting guys selling a few oz of weed right away lol. Those guys, like botting VNIs, are expendable, and CCP knows it. Go higher up the chain.
---
were gonna threaten your wallet if you unknowingly harbor botters...what kind of dumb shit is that?  this is a game...what alliance leader or sov renter is making the rounds daily to check in on each and every good little ratter boi?
---
harbor botters willingly?  fine.  but you cant expect players to police the player base through fear when you GMs cant even do it with player reports and server/admin tools.
---
Funny that scourge in Russian translates to "ya pidor"
---
In videos, they probably have these bonuses working for them:
---
* "Sisters" or Tech 2 probe launchers
---
* "Sisters" probes
---
* Most of the scanning skills trained to 5 for the first level and 4 or 5 for the second level
---
* Dedicated scanning ship (ships with bonus to scanning) especially the Tech 2 Cover Ops ship but at least the racial scanning frig like magnate, heron, imicus, and probe
---
* Gravity Capacitor upgrade rigs for bonus scanning
---
* There are some expensive implants to speed up probing.
---
Obviously not all the above are used in all videos / by all probers but a lot are.
---
As a low-skill newbro, you might get the most value from using a racial scanning frigate, training at least racial frigate 4, training as many scanning skills to 4, using the scanning rigs (T1 is fine / better) and using a sisters of eve probe launcher and sisters probe.
---
Even then, there are some signatures that might be impossible until you have near maxed skills.
---
That would require someone that is just playing the game for fun to manually review all of the corp. wallet tickets to see if someone is ratting for 18+ hours at 50+ ticks to count per name. That seems like a lot to ask someone playing the game to do on a daily or weekly basis per member. I 100 % agree that where you are looking/what you are highlighting is the right place to start though. I think that if they could do it laborwise, they should code in something that flags as a certain amount of of ticks achieved above XYZ (1mm isk?) per XYZ hours.
---
What do you mean going to do something? Have you ever seen those pirate faction ships with that ''fuck you'' diamond symbol? Those use advanced AI. Same goes for the drifters in (as far as I know) Wormholes.
---
FWIW I like this kind of thing. Keep the lore going!
---
For 15 to 20 minutes it sure as shit better drop 200 mm isk or people would just go back to using VNIs and that wouldn't be super fun for small gangs to catch. 
---
I input ur mum and she broadcasted an O-gasm 
---
It gets _much_ easier once you get your skills up. Don't forget there are _four_ relevant skills to scanning:
---
- Astrometrics
---
- Astrometric Pinpointing
---
- Astrometric Rangefinding
---
- Astrometric Aquisition
---
Train _all_ of these to 3 (very fast train), then trian Astrometrics (the first one) to 5. Then train Pinpointing and Rangefinding to 4. You can choose to leave Aquisition at 3 because it only affects speed, not accuracy, so it's more of a convenience thing.
---
This explains the differance - https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/5241022/

Do not criticize Dear Developer! The only ones you hurt are your community!
---
It could be that CCP did a investigation, and found that he wasn't input broadcasting outside of the chat msg ( or well we input broadcasting only to login multiple clients NOT cloak them, that would be legal ), and he forgot to turn it off after character select on all his clients, or it could be that CCP doesn't care we don't known. 
---
you tried making sense to morons.
---
ya except in the real world lore actually makes a difference to the game
---
They probably looked at the case and decided he did not break the rules. Shouldn't ban someone unless there is actual proof.
---
Checking the wallet for constant ratters would be really easy to automate with EVE's API, if you're interested I can even lend a hand, if it's for getting rid of botters.
---
You didn't let me watch very rude
---
Yes and they've been around and about for years. They're also a very small part of the Eve pve experience. Their plan _was_ to replace old AI with new AI. The whole point was to make the world more living.
---
What they have currently is good, it's just nowhere near enough
---
I see what you did there, but yea, that I can agree on
---
I am not that savvy with API or auth. But that sounds like a very useful thing to do. Serious statement, no jest.
---
That was a lame change imo. Anomalies are nuch easier to bot, you should make those omega. Missions can be fun to run with your friend or once in a while if you feel like doing some pve when you're nor actively playing (aka being omega)
---
I don't know the technical side of it, but as I understand, input broadcasting is when you are multiboxing and use a program or something to broadcast a command (let's say Lock target) to all of your active accounts at the same time. Multiboxing is okay when you manually, character after character, do the actions yourself. But if you use something that basically helps you to make that action on every single character at the same time, then it's illegal.
---
Gotta love those down votes that come in 8 mins before you could actually finish watching the video from the time being posted LOL
---
CCP could also just gift everyone their Vexor Police Skin of they activate 2FA. They don't loose money, everyone can get a nice goodie and it shows support for the thing ingame.
---
Basically my point
---
Down with the fascist ! Let shark week be abolished !
---
There is a bot designed to run incursions, mission bots have been around since at least 2008. 
---
WE GIVE NO QUARTER! 
---
So... just a thought and was curious if you guys ever contemplated this - implementing a spawn (*similar to faction*) that becomes ‚Äúenraged‚Äù and deals exponentially more damage over time (*i.e. Triglavian like*) to super-capital levels worth of damage. Perhaps the botting ships won‚Äôt notice and get nuked. I‚Äôm sure normal players will get nuked as well because there are a lot of ‚Äúnon-attentive types‚Äù... but at least you get a refined list to go off of.
---
Calling me retarded but goes ahead and says exactly what I just did.   
---
My point specifically relates to renting, not Alliance members. Next time don't charge into a comment with your head firmly shoved up your ass.
---
I mean the isk in the wallet was the result of cheating it seems not unreasonable if you work with cheaters (even unknowingly) any benefit you get from there cheating gets reverted. 
---
Your music...
---
&gt;who‚Äôre
---
Why is this allowed?
---
Why should I, as a theoretical alliance leader, be required to monitor my members' wallet journal for bot activity? How is that fun? This is a video game, not a forensic accounting simulator.
---
Can't appease everyone
---
perhaps if they negwalleted 10x the rent / tax for each botter caught the alliance leaders might take notice?
---
Are they going to have another highsec event where they transport the for all to shoot?
---
Shark week lasts for 7 days
---
Shart week lasts whole year
---
It's a cheap metric but the only one we really have. 
---
It's not the job of the alliance to police bots, nor should it be.
---
Fix the game, don't make players have to deal with the shitty parts.
---
BUT THE RORQUALS AND THE DRONE RETURN!
---
&gt; people who use alphas for mission pulling.
---
so multiboxing alpha accounts?
---
Don't take this the wrong way....but I'll believe that when I see it.
---
Fine by me tbh.
---
Was it even a week? 
---
I feel lied to
---
If it's that easy why doesn't CCP automate that?
---
Talking about downvotes only invites them my dude.
---
Same applies there really.
---
And that's how you get alpha clone intel bots cloaked on every gate
---
at yet those can be circumvented
---
Stop it! I'm getting flashbacks...
---
if i were CCP i'd look closely at any account that was active for 8+ hours, 7+ days in a row. bots may not run 23/7 but they sure are consistent. 
---
sounds like something ccp should do, not corps and alliances
---
There not, but if you work with cheaters and they get catch you losing the benefit of set cheating seems more then reasonable, it's CCP undoing well the effect of cheating. 
---
I‚Äôll add to what someone said already - but Abyssal sites! Yes the Gila is/can be the king of the abyss, but not solely. Abyssal space is nice because there are many different variety of spawns, different rooms, and to add to that different filament types and tiers. 
---
When I get bored of farming with a Gila I‚Äôll switch it up and hop in an Orthrus, Vedmak, Sacrilege, Vagabond, or hell, I‚Äôll do solo frig sites! Try frigs out with some friends, that shit is fun and rewarding too. 
---
Knowing is half the battle.
---
To be honest; if it comes to me, it's spite. I just don't want to throw my money at TAPI. I know the resistance of one won't make a difference.
---
Oh, absolutely. I agree. I just think it's also wrong to place the onus of detection on the leaders of the alliance. There's so many ways for that to go poorly.
---
Cause botters are paying subscribers so it's probably low priority. 
---
Drawing conclusions from crappy data is pretty counterproductive, and that's putting it diplomatically.
---
Well no one has asked this yet, but it's an important question: What is your current sensor strength? 
---
Hover your mouse over your probe launcher in the fitting window, and it should tell you what your sensor strength is. 
---
So in the future CUP will use a bot to hunt for bots. Nice. 
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks for the link! Site is blocked at work so I'll have to look it over later tonight.
---
Stain guy marry me please
---
A bot knows what it's looking for xp
---
Not sure why your post got downvoted into negatives, it's a perfectly reasonable question.
---
Taking my CCP hat off would mean also taking a break for the reality that resources to tackle botting are of course finite, and no other online game in existence faces the challenges we do when dealing with it because of the nature of how the game is built with a completely player centric economy.
---
CCP Grimmi and CCP Peligro take a horiffic amount of shit from people for no reason, when truth be told they're working their ASSES off constantly to try to sift through reports. A big part of what I'd do would be assiting them by making life harder for people who're trying to screw with our game and giving them more resources.
---
Bear in mind that I'm also not a game designer. If I was, you guys would hate me even more than you do now, because EVE would be one of the most savage games in existence.
---
With that in mind, taking my CCP hat off completely, some of the biggest steps I'd take for both botting and account security (if they were simple and workload wasn't an issue):
---
* Place every hull larger than a cruiser back behind the requirement for omega status.
---
* Place every weapon larger than medium back behind the requirement for omega status.
---
* Place T2, augmented and faction drones behind the requirement for omega status.
---
* Keep cross racial training for alphas, but place hulls that require a blend of racial spaceship command skills behind the requirement for omega status.
---
* Make NPC AI far more aggressive toward drones and fighters, and more unpredictable in general.
---
* Build an intelligence system that was separated entirely from the chat system from the ground up that required active user input to remain up to date.
---
* Local would become more akin to old "Region" or "Constellation" chat - here's a list of people roughly in your area, if they choose to show themselves.
---
* Look at creating incentives and gameplay to keep people active during activities that are often done AFK (mining for example).
---
* Quadruple the headcount on the Security Team with a couple of programmers and four more security analysts.
---
* Make 2FA mandatory for all accounts that have any roles that give access to pooled assets or ISK.
---
* Account based rewards for first time enabling 2FA and cumulative rewards every quarter for keeping it active.
---
I'd also go full scorched earth. You bot? You're screwed? You harbor botters and receive dirty ISK for them, we empty your wallet. Don't have enough ISK to pay back what you got illegally? Your keepstars and corp assets start vanishing. Zero tolerance. You collude in harming our game and community, we level you. Cut and dry.
---
That said, this whole post is based on the caveat that there were no limitations on what we could do. Some of this is really not realistic, even if I'd like to see it personally.
---
Fair enough. This will push the bots to level 3s which is less income but they will still exist. I do wonder how many legit alpha players this will affect though. I'd imagine it's a small number but still any change to stop bots is good I guess
---
Do you guys not have phones? 
---
I do not think EvE is bad, i have been through hell (play store) and back. 
---
Then i heard from a friend that EvE is free to play and instantly i was in love. :D 
---
I preferred the old blocky look. Stations were giant oblongs floating in space. It felt like I was flying around in a crappy sci-fi B-movie.
---
Now it's a Hollywood blockbuster with a CGI Darth Vader.
---
Fair enough, but won't bots just move to l3 missions instead? Not as much income but still income nonetheless
---

Alliance leaders who are harboring botters are going to get theirs eventually when they get found out. Doesn't matter what flag they fly.

---
It's like 10/20 minutes to write the code, most alliances have an IT team so they should be fine. 
---
He probably got a socket closed anyway
---
Has CCP ever considered setting up a hotline for in-progress RMT/hacking reports?
---
For example, I just logged in and [see this on contracts.](http://prntscr.com/mn80jy) It's a 5b RMT by someone in jita 4-4. If I could report this immediately, it might be possible to crack down on the buyer &amp; seller very fast, or if the isk is being muled, seize the illicit isk and ban both a hacked/sold account and an rmt mule. 
---
However, if I include it in a report to security@ccpgames.com, I doubt it'll get read for 2-3 months. While it might eventually get investigated, *the RMTer will claim his profit on the isk regardless, prompting him to continue running his RMT ring.* If the isk can't be interdicted before the RMT seller makes his RL money, there's no hope of running him out of the business. 
---
In more important cases, I often (1-2 times a week usually) see accounts that look like they've just been cracked by a hacker. A good hacker can strip a character clean in 20 minutes or less; if my report doesn't get read for weeks, there's no hope of sparing damage to the account (or stopping him from making hundreds of dollars.) If I had a way to get direct access to a CCP rep and explain what was going on, the account could be temp-banned before all its stuff was lost. 
---
Thanks for the update, /u/CCP_Falcon and for the effort I am sure all of you are putting into this.
---
However, I beg you, please let's not make the problem go full circle though, and full "YouTube  copyright strike" system, where automation will end up being the new grief us player will have to bear, with the bane of false positives being the new menace driving people away. Automation is good and needed, but can't replace devs/GMs judgement on matter like these. Reality is, this problem could have already been addressed much better than it already is if you guys were given enough hands to handle it.
---
And we're back again to many of the issues the game is facing right now being down to the personnel at CCP just not being there in enough numbers to sustain what EVE requires to keep improving, and us and the game being essentially on maintenance mode because of lack of manpower. Budget cuts win again :(
---
Ironically, we'd probably have the easiest time of it. (It'd still be an unfun pain in the ass.) We have a deep software development bench and already collect the API information. However, making this a requirement for *any* alliance that wants to own space or krab means that every single alliance leader has to be able to write code or recruit someone who does, or face censure.
---
This isn't meant to invoke Malcanis' Law or anything; it's just plain bad for retention. Raising the bar to running an organization reduces the number of organizations that can be run, and the single best indicator of retention  is whether or not a player belongs to a player-run corporation.

---
Really appreciate your help. Ill try out the Worm meanwhile and Im getting gallente frig to V, so the thermal damange will be maxed out. So maybe for the T1 frigs with gallente frig V thermal will be the way.
---
I would pay so much money for a hardcover book of all the ships of Eve.
---
 Why do you guys believe made up numbers when you see the same botting operations run unaffected.
---
That might actually be allowed
---
I appreciate your work too. Can you ask for a Police Revelation or Moros skin please? 
---
makes sense
---
Any chance you can leverage Eve DEV community to help contribute to the project? 
---
Totally aware some needs to be OpSec to work, but there's a wealth of knowledge who would contribute in small ways to help train &amp; refine a model. Just putting it out there!
---
Having local through traffic is nice, and not a particular danger to you when re-shipping.
---
One thing to check would be JF range from hubs if you're going to use your own JF or PushX (shameless plug). Bits of the Amarr-Minmatar warzone are single jumps from Jita (Egmar for instance), which will make your logistics less of a ballache.
---
I wanna put a circlejerky reply here, but ill be real. Something will release as "1.0" eventually out of that studio. Question is how much will be cut?
---
Ur gay pwned
---
i never understood how people assume the character they see is alpha.
---
What CCP needs to do, is make it very obvious who is alpha, and who is not.
---
&gt; What you keep not getting is that not everyone plays Eve your way. We don't measure success with MERs and propaganda and membercount and citadels destroyed and sov space invaded. We are literally 10 people irl too, so it's not like we can make any difference that way.
---
My dear friend, i think this statement of yours cuts both ways.
---
Maybe i am a stupid, slow and unskilled carebear. Ratting, mining and having fun while doing all this stuff you consider dull and stupid. You know what i consider stupid? Playing a game while not having fun. But at the same time, i love EvE to bits as well as you do. 
---
Isn't this supposed to be the beauty of this game? To let everyone play the way they want to? If i want to farm ISK like there is no tomorrow in a stable corp with the backing of a strongest federation in the game, why should i not be alowed to try and should you not be allowed to try and disrupt our farming? 
---
I am not saying what you are doing is wrong. You are playing the game as it suits you. And so are we.
---
I reckon it‚Äôs about economics. Reduce the profitability of the bot, every ban becomes more effective. Eventually it‚Äôll be too expensive to set up new ones (in terms of time and investment) versus packing up and moving to some other game.
---
And what about the alliances with a metric fuckton of capitals in stock that wouldn't feel the impact in months?
---
?
---
If only CCP could be bothered to define the actual allowed uses.. FFS it would only take a few hours to do this...
---
-
---
Or left vague deliberately which is typical of CCP....
---
Sounds good to me. After all, the Imperium controls most T2 production and the lion's share of the R16+ mining, so this would line our pockets most excellently. 
---
Not really, NC. has kicked renters out even before CCP has taken action.
---
On the other hand in Limperium, Mittani tells people not to report bots and Brave kicks people out for fucking with botters and Fey and Omist are you're got botting zones.
---
They will die over time. This is something that should have been done long time ago. Not fixing the issue because people will have a fuck ton isn‚Äôt a good reason to leave it broken.
---
If only people put some critical thinking skills to work before vomiting their ideas out into the interwebz....

Please seek professional help if such urges to begin to gestate within that colossal melon on top of your neck &lt;3

If you have blue eyes, catch them on warp in to the site with a hic.
---
Maybe frigs/destroyers with a boosher? Boosh in the direction they mjd if you can't get scram.
---
There is a guy botting in Imperium regions for 3 months now and is still not banned:

---
I don't think it's really something we could outsource to be honest, given security concerns etc.
---
:joy: +1 for that falcon. 
---
How many hands do you have?
---
Lmao now having an actual it department is a requirement for running am alliance.
---
ive been recording for years and it hurts to re-watch every time spotting those errors, activated AB far too late, over-repped at the start nervously then was focusing on gun heat while rep paste was wasted, approached the ceptors rather than orbiting etc... every fight is a weird equation of your original fits and tactics, then you minus each others various mistakes ... suppose you just try to make less of them .. but ive not learned to be a perfect combat pilot in over a decade so doubt i ever will be hehe :D
---
Oh look it‚Äôs cancer. Hi o/. So annoying cancer, whats your solution? Don‚Äôt have one huh? Yet everyone knows its fucked up and we got here because of millennials gamers. Yet you come here to cancer up my comment section without submitting anything beneficial. Hope you lose a leg in a car accident.
---
Are they joining the big Russian coalition?
---
I bet I didn't get  invite to watch because local was down very sad
---
If some one actually unsubbed because if that video they were probably gonna unsub anyway.
---
There is also a diff between some unsubbed with trillions of isk to keep playing and some one who legit leaves the game.
---
Honestly, people just want Comms.
---
Which issues is this suppose to fix?
---
Better then never feeling that impact
---
spending time sat at 0 on that landing point in bubbles with web scram fit ships can be a gift that keeps on giving, i do that a lot, tried to fight a retribution later in the same ship (different bubbles) but he was smart enough to kite out so i had to make a grueling dash 40k through bubbles and exit swiftly, lil beast still help up to the damage well
---
Also thanks for rescuing my Stork 
---
Oh and log-scaling damage caps for citadels to encourage people to bring caps on grid. 
---
But what if they are used to deny their competitors the possibility to replace their capitals?
---
I miss you Stu baby
---
Well, the best "normal" relic and data sites are level 4. They are quite rare, so it's not absolutely terrible if you can't scan them. But it's nice if you can, and it is possible in a T1 frigate.
---
Minimal requirements, which I had for quite some time: One scan rangefinding array, Sisters Core Scanner Probes (but only normal T1 Probe launcher), Astrometrics skill to 4, all other scanning skills to 3.
---
For Lvl 4 I had to go down to 0.25 AU and then center one last time and bring the probes closer together (STRG+mousewheel).
---
There is only Lvl 5 site - the superior sleeper cache. You can't really run this in a frigate anyways, so scanning that is not a priority.
---
as far as i can figure he went defensive waiting for the web scram ceptors then back to damage mode when they landed hoping to land his shots, it actually helped me finish him faster but the AB helped me vs the ceptor guns
---
The fact they are spammed in game as fast as battleships. There are more titans and supers than jump freighters. Thats a problem 
---
I think we should even go a step further with the dirty ISK thing. They are enabling the RMT and botters to do what they do as well. I say if a player harbors botters and gets cash from them, ban them as well.
---
Holy shit, 8 VNI losses in a day. 
---
I honestly don't know what CCP are doing to detect botters, but it's obviously not working well enough...
---
The big ISK bots right now are project discovery. There are only 1600ish solutions and the botters have them all mapped out. 
---
If they attack the smaller entities and effectively deny them the replacement of their capitals, the impact will never happen, you will just have one entity with gigantic capital overpower.
---
Easier solution. Reduce capital insurance. 
---
Do you mind explaining a little more? 
---
f
---
Interesting post, thanks.
---
Sounds like the free accounts, given how much they have access to, are causing much of the issue.
---
It would be nice to rework some of the more passive activities to reward a more active playstyle, though. As much as I like free isk, might be better if i were playing eve rather than watching Netflix or such.
---
Dang, I bet you were sweating bullets listening to all that going on while boosting the shield. You should totally copy that for yourself if you haven't already, it's well written. I'd love to hear more stories like this, just pilots on the front line trying to do thier best. It would be cool to compile stories like this. It's got a band of brothers feel, the old history channel show, not BoB.
---
That just leads to everyone being even more risk adverse
---
You mean like we have now?
---
Instructions unclear, dick stuck in the doll. Send halp!
---
Hm. Yeah you're right on that one. 
---
I mean I'm happy with all of these suggestions, Pretty sure a lot of the community would be as well. It would make the game harder than it actually is and what Eve was once actually known for.
---
Has anything like this actually been brought up to the big wigs / even been looked at?
---
Contact u/cap_qu (Worpout in game) 
---
Small correction, you need at least 104 to scan a Superior Sleeper Cache. I doubt the OP will be interested in those for a while, but since you brought up "everything"...
---
 There is no solution for that other then all of eve getting together and fighting said alliance. Problem is it shouldn‚Äôt have ever made it this far to begin with. Another solution is to come out with a sub capital whos only role is to counter supers and titans. At the end of the day, checks and balances are needed. spamming end game ships and allowing everyone into them will give us the same faith as the Chinese server in the long run. We are already floating down shit creek without a paddle. I don‚Äôt know about you but i can hear rumbling off in the distance. 
---
And a sister launcher.
---
Jita is a one stop shop no messing about everytime someone shoot someone else space castle
---
just look up the alliances ingame, their bio/description will have the necessary information
---
some names to look up ingame:
---

etc.
---
This post gave me brain damage
---
This is a different ship. This is the [ARGO SRV](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/ships/argo-srv/Argo-SRV). The one /r/eve went to war over was [Vulture](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/ships/drake-vulture/Vulture)
---
Can someone interpret this for me? Sounds thrilling but I don‚Äôt follow.
---
It would be even worse. atm the only thing holding back are the alliances themselves.
---
I tried my best... we strained a bit lol
---
This is incorrect. I can built a battleship in less than 2 hours. The fastest I can build a dreadnought including all the parts (assuming 5 runs split over 12 characters with max build slots for pure speed) is around 5 days 22 hours without build implant. Maybe 5h 16 with. Let's call it 6 days for a rounding issue. With the same capability in build slots as this is 9,504 battleships over the same time period.
---
The risk averse would lose more fights because they would refuse to commit. The rest of us would chuck them into the fire and if it dies, it dies.
---
Whats come first: eve finaly diyng out or sc release?
---
&gt;1) Try starting a convo with them: if no response within x amount of time ‚Äì check
---
2) Try decloaking and bubbling/scramming/webbing them and see if/how they react: no normal reaction i.e. attacking your ships or trying to get away - check
---
Pretty sure afk VNIs can check both without being bots.
---
I think some of it was not great.
---
* Don't go for an Astero early. It's much more expensive, and if you can't fit a covert ops cloaking device, it's not worth the extra cost.
---
* start scanning at 4 AU, not 8. Center on the star or on a planet, not in the middle of these huge red balls. All sigs are within 4 AU of one of these, pirate faction sites even closer than that.
---
* If you get 2 connected dots, the correct one is the dot, which is further away from the center of your probing (&gt;95% true, there are some rare exceptions). If you get a circle, the sig is also usually near the far end from your current center.
---
* Number of sites does not correlate to the distance from market hubs. Completed sites respawn in the region, so if there is a large inbalance of exploration activities in a region, the sites tend to concentrate in unused corners. But there is no higher density if the whole region has less explorers.
---
And you just assume the people you are referring to don't have other things to do in their free time than worry about stuff CCP is supposed to worry about, because they are paid to do so?
---
I would like all alliances to at least put some thought into preventing bot networks from operating in their organization. But they are not employed to put countless man hours into it.
---
They do that with a lot of ships in game. They are called T2 ships. Perhaps you are secretly asking for T2 and Navy issue capitals? I agree with that secret request to boost the value of moon mining and LP farming.
---
You‚Äôre missing the point. Everyone and their mother are building supers and titans. They are in an abundance.
---
&gt;If only CCP could be bothered to define the actual allowed uses
---
They did?
---
https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/5241022/
---
&gt;Examples of allowed Input Broadcasting and Input Multiplexing are actions taken that do not have an impact on the EVE universe and are carried out for convenience:
---
&gt;‚Ä¢ EVE Online client settings
---
&gt;‚Ä¢ Window positions and arrangements (of the EVE Online client in your operating system‚Äôs desktop environment)
---
&gt;‚Ä¢ The login process
---
Dude... ain't gonna ban no 50-70 accounts that are subbed a month. Get real bro.
---
Im not following what you‚Äôre trying to say or suggest. Im asking for super and titans to use more than just null ore.
---
It's a shame that so many people having played the game with the intent of reaching an end goal of owning a really big shiny toy are achieving their goals.
---
CCP doesn't want to fix the botting problem. Its providing more income than losses from fed up players.
---
Surely skyrocketing T2 prices with nerf the goons
---
Dont know who you‚Äôre trying to fool. Only 1% of people actually reached end game. Rest were skill injectors, wallet warriors, and alliance allowing botting to skill inject people into titans and supers *cough goons
---
I was pointing out that all t2 hulls in the game use t2 material. Capital hulls are t1. Perhaps they should introduce t2 hulls so that they use up moon goo materials and PI. (Keep in mind they would then get a new set of per skill level bonus' and boosts).
---
And if I was actively ratting and someone did this to me under these new rules, I would deliberately not respond to either of these just to get concorded so I can open a ticket, complain that the system is fucking stupid and get my ship reimbursed.
---
President jibrisch's recent power grab: declaring **emergency** shark week in r/eve &lt;&gt; already 16 posters sue him for illegitimate garbage disposal &lt;&gt; Staindude just announced he will once again run for csm in the upcoming election &lt;&gt; CCP under-fire for refusing to organize international space cockfight &lt;
---
would shop @ that Wal-Mart for a gun 10/10
---
Countless... 
---
It's a single days work to create a script that checks for someone who is getting ticks for majority of the day. 
---
You have data to back that up? It sounds like internet facts made up on the spot.
---
Sadly i dont care about goons.
---
I'm not even a goon and I'm sick of hearing the circle jerk of how game mechanics are broken in the goons favor or how garbage the game is because of it. Fuck off. Its the way the game is now, deal with  it. Have fun or biomass and stop complaining. 
---
Like you need more isk... I mean, at this point you are so far ahead on the krabbing front that this would be another drop in the ocean.
---
No to mention, why would you ever give anyone intel about whether you are afk or not?
---
Cheers mate, it was a close run thing which is probably why it was so memorable. Not over yet though, the second battle kicked off three days later then the station came out of reinforce - but I'll write that one out tomorrow. Also got some footage I'm uploading to youtube for it.
---
So they do this and capitals would go up a bil at most for gsf. Everywhere else five +... seems fair.
---
Its a no brainer. When skill injectors were introduced, the very small amount or rorq pilots boom like no other. The handful of titans and supers boom a year afterwards. If you played the game prior you saw it. Its youre noob, you ask for data.
---
For a true glimpse at how dire this games current state is, you only need log into any of the starter NPC corps.  These used to be teeming with life.
---
Leave a char logged into one of these corps for an hour in your primetime.  Come back and see how little activity there is.  This game gets *very* few new players while vets are fleeing like rats on a sinking ship.  It is the same 300-400 bots/silent scout alts in every npc corp every single day.  
---
"B-but muh nullsec!"  Yes, we know thats where the games populations lie. But a genuinely new player does not know that.  They join their starter corp, see only silence and then assume the worst. To a new player in a starting corp this game is absolutely dead.  That sort of environment does not engender people to stick around.
---
Assuming that things will work out is tantamount to simply shoving ones head in the sand and hoping for the best.  To say that CCP has a bad track record with business management and profit investment would be an understatement to say the least.
---
&gt; Alliance leaders who are harboring botters are going to get theirs eventually when they get found out
---
Alliance leaders are not GMs it's not their job to police the game and enforce the rules.
---
The trick to being a good finance person, at least in Eve, is to ignore the concept of "enough."
---
So you are mad about:
---
People that use in game mechanics (injectors)
---
People that have RL cash (wallet warriors)
---
and the hateboner for Goons (that last statement, wew lawd)
---
To be completely honest, you just come across as someone that is pissed because other people have things you do not.
---
I suggest you get over this, your life will be much better.
---
Its a endgame ship. Citidels are t1 yet they take PI. There is faction stations too. What‚Äôs your reasoning there?
---
&gt; Make dreads more mobile with c7 wormholes with ns static accomodating 10-15 dreads in one go. Organization doesn't enable locals to have the priviledge to use their supers and titans for defense, with attackers having no option to counter the blob. Game mechanics do.
---
Literally just let us have cap capable 3b NS statics. C2s and C4s have 2 statics, just give c6 a second kspace static. Every pvp group in the game would move to one. 
---
Ouch, I like ops idea(sorta, might need some work/specifics cuz it sounds like making the current capitals akin to T2 builds) but come on bro, let fammo drive safe! 
---
That is a very good point too.
---
So what about the time you banned KunMi because he was too good a bomber multiboxer? 
---
100% is overrated I have scanned down almost everything with as little as 30% as almost all opjects you can scan are at about 25%.
---
I have used expensive implants and rigs to get to 80% and have found no real difference in scanning stuff down the biggest factor to increase scanning   seems to be using sisters probes. 
---
Except alphas cant cloak
---
!yao
---
Why is elite drone AI price dropping so much ?
---
I have no idea, they left stain some time ago. 
---
Hoped for some info here. 
---
:thinking:
---
you decloak at :02, while wetus are still anchoring, and the drones are right next to the rorqs.
---
first group recalled/off grid at 7 seconds
---
next group at 8
---
last drone at 9. 
---
All the while the guy is obviously active, still anchoring wetus, and launching fighters .
---
just shut the fuck up already  
---
Add ladyscarlet as a friend on discord and give her a shout

Start watching the Discord then, the Drifters have been actively attacking including player structures.
---
Most already have it, like honestly i have yet to be in a eve corp where 1 or 2 programmers where not either in leadership rolls or line members. 
---
If your gonna rent out space or run a large nullsec entity, you're gonna have a need for custom code anyway. 
---
So, you have no data?
---
I see what kind of player I‚Äôm talking too. Im annoyed because eve use to be dynamic. Now its full of useless gamers ‚Äúlike you‚Äù who are risk adverse and wants to flaunt their stash of ships. You want a net of safety and we you dont get your way. You along with the other weebs cry for the cancer we live in today. This gameplay is stagnant and boring. Where the only way to get any content is to have +1 with bigger and better ships vs your enemy. I want what we had before these changes. When a solo sleipner could roam null and get amazing fights. Where lowsec was full on small to large size skirmish. Not this carebear online crap you support today.
---
Definitely, but AFK VNIs probably aren't ratting 23h per day either. Breaks here and there, etc. i.e. They wouldn't be deemed bots in the first place based on their input commands/time online actively flying.
---
Good point, though.
---
I remember an old 3D space RTS called Homeworld. Maybe something like that with Eve ships.
---
Those are citadels. They are not ships.
---
Dude look it up. Im not spoon feeding you. Not my fault you dont have the time in game to see this.
---
You made up a statistic on the spot and then want to me find data to back up your imaginary facts. That's not how it works.
---
They are T1. These are capitals and not sub capitals. They should require more since they are different. 
---
I don't think there is a 30 day gap in his killboard, there is a gap between Jan 18 and Jan 27 but last i check that's less then 30 day's. 
---
It's a little difficult to spot, unfortunately. Late last week, a number of Citadels in the Semiki system set up in response to this story arc were reinforced by Drifters. That's a new behavior in highsec, and we formed up in expectation that they would try and follow up on the armor timer.
---
Unfortunately the Drifters just kind of floated around in space instead, doing nothing as the Citadels repaired. We're not sure if it was a deliberately one-off thing, or the AI bugged out and short-circuited what was supposed to be a bigger event.
---
+10 Respect for CCP implant plugged in, wp falcon
---
No mention of exploration botters?
---
Very cool
---
I think, aside from the "ccp wants bots because they buy plex" people, most of the shit given to Team Security is really meant for whoever at CCP decided to only allocate 2 guys to this job.
---
I also want to play in your EVE. How do we make that happen? 
---
Can my capitals have 300km points and webs like citadels too? I mean, you want to make them more similar.
---
&gt; Players could sign up as Concord Citizen Special Forces (or whatever name). You would see a list of suspected botters AND their known areas where they fly. Concord would lend you extremely powerful special ships that you could never keep or unequip.
---
generally just a trash idea, but
---
&gt; 1) Try starting a convo with them: if no response within x amount of time ‚Äì check
---
people still expect me to respond to their convo requests in 2019? wow
---
I want NPC bots to run relics before botters do!
---
Large code rewrite for 64bit client (actually secret anti bot client features).
---
Im not going to do the research for you just to prove my point to you. Time invested to prove 1 person doesn‚Äôt outweigh me caring that much. Just because you think its false, 1000 of other players along with the devs knows this information is correct.
---
If you roamed in NC rental space you would know better than to say that tbh
---
This is like the advice: just don't die, it works both in RL and In game. 
---
wormholes
---
log off 
---
Then you just want CCP to put their thumb on the scale in our favor?  Alright, I guess.
---
Stating something in a manner like everyone knows it to be true, does not make it accurate or factual. Otherwise.. I could say that everyone knows you are an idiot, 10 million people on the internet say so and if you don't believe me... you just need to do your own research and you will see that I am absolutely correct and you should have known it because I said. Obviously I won't go do your research for you, you should just know you are an idiot. The devs all agree. /confirmatiobiasstrong
---
I mean not really do you think it's realistic for other alliances to scale the point that goons have specially now?
---
i should have some in my backyard ;D
---
That's fine, what I meant that objecting that such a change would make goons richer is pointless, because you are so far ahead that it doesn't even matter anymore.
---
Well thanks for the constructive feedback.
---
Isn't it amazing that all Rorqual pilots also happen to be Starcraft pros with amazing APM?
---
will you be at eve north.  you were one of the devs i always wanted to buy a beer.  (i would offer to buy you enough beer for your fill but after seeing you on the throne of beer at fanfest my wallet seems to think i could not do that)
---
And the probes , it might be worth it to buy them at least to catch your first sig. after that you get the idea.
---
translation: if we banned all bots immediately, we'd go bankrupt from the loss of subs.
---
log off
---
black ops bridge
---
I mean, I know- right? How the heck do these guys manage to hit 8 or 10 keys in 1-2 seconds? It's not possible!
---
Imagine being paid to roast people. 
---
As the guy below mentioned, you wouldn't be flagged in the first place, so this wouldn't be an issue. Do you afk rat 23h per day 7 days a week? I doubt it. I understand your concern, just responding to it with the idea in mind.
---
I do t know who you are but I miss you too. 
---
I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm also definitely not saying bots are impossible either, and on the balance of how eve looks currently I'd place my bets on the second rather than the first.
---
Materall..
---
Even ignoring the question of "Is inflation a strictly good thing for the player base," I don't think you need to worry about inflation slowing down by an appreciable amount any time soon.

Can we have these things plz, no seriously. 
---
Not with their current attitude and planning.
---
I failed to put the link into the title. I don't know how! I failed. But it was funny, no? I find it silly that people are seeing it truly difficult to hit a handful of keys in a second or two.
---
Nice update mates.

Frank the Bank being a noob isn't really news though.

---
Until you provide Alliance Leaders the tools to help you police your game you might want to re-think your comment.
---
You can easily multibox 3 Hawks in a level 4 dark site, with only an investment of 300 mil isk. I've ran level 5s with he same setup and with buddies, but I suppose if you are megamind you could multibox that too. I've never really looked into the cruiser side of things because it seems like much more of an investment for a much lower success rate. Myself, I easily average at 150 mil for each site (20 mins.) Try it.
---
Will number 5 shock me?
---
this fucking high apm meme is retarded
---
you can easily touch 3-4 clients in a second without really even trying, which means 10 rorquals will retract all drones within 3 seconds of inputs
---
it's not about having high APM, it's about doing the same motion over and over a thousand times (because you have) and already being really quick. round robin is even faster and there are even faster legal methods of doing simple commands across many clients (like having one of those megakeyboards, and assigning an individual key to an individual client with a command associated with it https://i.imgur.com/RMk28XE.png
---
Then do it and share it here for everyone to benefit from.
---
That is because you have not tried reading the descriptions for any of the flavorful loot drops, such as the Log Fragments.

totally right, brawlinf fit on it is not hard to do
---
ccp couldnt separate ghost training sp based on account sub status....how do you expect them to separate botting isk from legitimate isk after its been through 2-3 wallets minimum when were talking about 10s of trillions.  
---
Id like some solo subcap pvp.. gatecamps don't do it for me.
---
Yes
---
No, add maybe another 50 to 100 more, they had to make new ones to recover lost time and isk between re-rolling current bot characters
---
Hey, this is a low effort post....
---
Also by the way have you ever heard of ISBoxer? No, it's not banned, but macros with it are...however you can still use it to very very quickly change between clients with hotkeys. So if all of the UI's are similar or similar hotkeys exists, it's just a matter of doing that to obtain whatever goal (Pulling all drones in, warping off without using fleet warp, etc)
---
Wow. I didn't know those existed. Also, you can't mean that there are 1600 test question? Right?
---
&gt; Im annoyed because eve use to be dynamic. Now its full of useless gamers ‚Äúlike you‚Äù who are risk adverse

I'd love to know when you think the game was "dynamic" and full of people who weren't risk _averse_.
---
This is weird but I'll take it 
---
I love it when im right. Pussy
---
It sure as hell will affect me as i do l4 burners as alpha sometimes

Oh wow,  really appreciate the helpful tips, i find that the people who play this game are not very patient with new guys,  so i really appreciate all the advice given her,  thanks again

Here's a quick run down of what's currently happening. Take a look in the [World News](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/) section about the Semiki system.
---
TLDR: [Something fucky's going on in Semiki. Some guy broke in and now there's a cyber virus running around.](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/semiki-zainou-biohazard-containment-compromised/) [A virus with Rogue Drone connections that targets implants has hit a couple stations and Ishukone asked for help.](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/semiki-situation-deteriorates-ishukone-watch-releases-initial-findings/) Specificly they said "It would assist our researchers immensely if amiable parties would be able to gather and supply us with relevant research material, like rogue drone nexus chips, artificial intelligences, and other fragments of rogue drones. Additionally, any trinary datastreams,". Players responded by acquiring a frankly massive pile of trinary data from the Abyss. Tens of billions of ISK of Rogue Drone parts. Tens of thousands of trinary data stream items from the Abyss. Everyone thought they were doing good to help the Caldari with their virus.
---
Oveg Drust, CONCORD NPC, steps in and tells them [such massive stockpiles of rogue drone and trinary data could be dangerous. Do not hand it over to the Caldari, hand it over to CONCORD.](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/ikame-semiki-investigative-work/134331/68) Some players agreed, while others delayed. The delay seems to be the right choice as [Ishukone appealed to CONCORD and managed to get the order to turn over the data revoked.](https://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/ishukone-and-cep-battle-saro-in-concord-assembly-over-dangerous-research-materials/)
---
[Meanwhile in Semiki, Drifter and Seeker ships have started to show up in numbers that are definitely not normal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNZ24XDQzX8) Over 100 Drifter ships, mix of BS's and Cruiser. Countless Lancers. Some Citadels that were put in to the area got reinforced by the Drifters. [A group of Spanish(I think?) Goons showed up with smart bombing Mallers to try to clear the drifter swarm.](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001359/201902152300/o/%7B%22A%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22B%22%3A%5B%2298493825%5C%2F%22%2C%2298586062%5C%2F%22%5D%7D/) [Someone learned you don't bring a Golem to an alpha strike party.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75153433/) [Screenshot of the overview from someone during one of the initial Citadel shield fights, we were totally not prepared and got whomped by the Drifters](https://i.imgur.com/rPMpAcO.png)
---
The next day when the three Citadels came out in to their armor timer, a fleet was built up of many RPers and friends attempting to want to try to defend the citadels against Drifter attacks. Like before, more than 100 Drifter ships were in system but it seems they were parked by CCP in the asteroid belts. All three citadels repaired uncontested...? Maybe that was intended, maybe the CCP Dev in charge of driving a swarm of drifters was sick, maybe they assumed we would charge towards the Drifters and attack, no idea. 
---
So now we are where we are. There's that news conference in this post at the top of this page and the people who've been involved in this so far are not sure where this wild ride is going.
---
I can confirm by the way in the Drifter shattered wormholes through the Unidentified Wormhole, the connections inside those are in general way up. This is very abnormal considering the last few years. So -something- is up but I can see how most people wouldn't notice or wouldn't care. It's not affecting people yet.
---
You could work on convincing CCP to limit accounts to one per person?
---
Just feels like a lot of people are trying to deny that bot mining is a big thing. Like you can't just google it and take the first result and be on your way.
---
I find that a lot more believable than everyone being 100% attentive and having good APM, especially since it's obvious how much botting is going on from the VNI bots, market bots, mission running bots, FW bots.
---
Plenty of people create their own content. Maybe "the game is dead" for a certain playstyle. Maybe we don't need FCs or big aliances. Maybe the player base needs to stop being so risk -averse and just hop in a ship and go look for some solo pvp. What's with all the ship spinning and need for easy content? 
---
nah, multiple accounts are totally a-ok
---
If you use EVE-O and just tab through screens or hotkey clients you can hit  Num 1 and then - over and over and over pretty quickly. It doesn't make it a script, hardware acceleration or anything else. Remapping keys is all fine and dandy as long as you don't cause a key to do multiple actions.
---
dont worry, people rarely upload videos of all their failed fights, only 1 in 50 fights goes anything like this well in reality .. i die .. i die a lot... but you've gotta take those "im never gunna win this" fights every now and then...this is where T1 fun ships come in handy.
---
But efficient use of them is a no no?
---
don't want to sound rude but since i am a goon and the newblets in brave couldn't possibly have experience with anything as they spend their life in stations, docked and running from goons, i will after all. 
---
\- astero in highsec much more expensive = 30 extra mils. that is a single lvl 2 sansha relic site. 
---
\- i won't comment on that, just scan at 4 and see how it goes :)  if you get smth better than a heron, and ofc better skills you can easily scan 4/1/0.25 but as an alpha 8/2/0.5 was more reliable for me. 
---
\- the third rule is a general one, the dumbass above is reffering to scanning an anom directly. Once you switch to wh or a anom-populated system, stuff changes as many anoms will render a double signal. 
---
\- number of sites really correlates indirectly to the proximity of hubs. Most beginners will do explo and they tend to not go far from hubs. meaning you will find untouched sites easier farther away from hubs. anoms work like this: you finish an anom, another one spawns in the same region. if you are in a not populated corner of a region, you will find both untouched anoms AND sites which were done where populated systems are spawn AND you have a smaller chance that somebody faster than you will scan it first. 
---
Lol, This is 1 Acc where he always inputs into the same instance, I too like to compare apples with pears ...
---
More than one can Judge.
---
I couldn't tell you who is or is not bot mining. I can easily point out the AFK people by drones dying to rats. It just feels, to me, that right now every single rorqual fleet is getting it's very own reddit post about input broadcasting when someone can't kill their drones. I can't imagine it is helpful to the team filtering through these to get so many false positives over and over because it serves to create karma upvotes and grr hate whoever grr.
---
what?
---
I stand with Jibrish.
---
I'm sorry, who are you?
---
How the hell do you do burners as an alpha?! I won't lie I'm impressed.
---
But yeah that sucks to hear. Wondering how many others will be affected like this
---
Dang, you wild!
---
&gt; first group recalled/off grid at 7 seconds
---
Lol if you had the slightest idea what you are talking about (or a brain) you would realize all Rorquals scooped the same tick (7), and the 5 then the 1 drone in the overview are those which had to reapproach to their Rorquals as they weren't in scoop range yet.
---
eve is dying
---
The problem though is most of us already care and actively try to remove bots when we find them.  All this does is send the message that we might get fucked anyway if we miss any.  
---
My process for bot reports is as follows:
---
* Take an hour out of my day to fly out and shit test the suspected bot
---
* If I'm reasonably certain it's a bot, report it and kick it.
---
* If I'm reasonably certain it's not a bot, do nothing
---
* If I'm not sure whether or not it's a bot, report to ccp and keep watch on the person.
---
Keep in mind, Alliance leaders have no access to server logs, and we take time away from playing a game we pay for to do the work of the security team.  Chances are TEST does a good enough job to be fine, but it still leaves a really sour taste in my mouth with the tone they set here.  My assumption has always been that CCP has more tools than I do, so if I'm not sure I'll leave the judgement call to them.  When did that become an unreasonable stance?
---
Yeah no.
---
How out of touch do you have to be to think every alliance has an IT department and coders on call?
---
Sisters core launcher is close to 40mil and only lends an extra 5 percent-not worth imo. There are also rigs that increase scan strength and relic virus strength, gravity capacitor and scope emission sharpener iirc. The .25au probe adjustment is performed by holding alt and dragging the center cube of one of your probes so the spheres intersect each other to a greater degree (you may know this but other instructions seemed ambiguous). You can recall probes but they will automatically pop into cargo when you change systems... although getting a socket closed and sometimes just jumping a wormhole has caused this to not happen for me sometimes so it's probably best practice to manually recall when you finish scanning. Lastly, don't fit a cargo scanner and "cherry pick" cans to hack. You will make more isk by running the site fully and despawning it, as this causes a fresh spawn in your region. If you do go the cargo scanner route, intentionally failing cans you don't want to hack for lack of loot will also acheive the same result-the important thing is to not leave unfinished sites if you intend to continue exploring the same region. 
---
This feels like a commentary. This feels personal. I feel personally attacked.
---
There's definitely a point at which behaviour becomes suspicious. Someone COULD, in theory, multibox 10 VNIs in a system and warp them all as soon as someone entered local, however we all know that most of them are bots, along with botting carriers and supers, as has been shown on here time and time again. 
---
If you don't like seeing posts about them, downvote them and move on I guess. CCP will (hopefully, although I don't have much hope currently) ban them if they are a bot, and not ban if its a high APM Starcraft player doing some rorqual mining.
---
Garmur
---
And you have to be bit blingy since your alpha dps isnt enough without the Caldari BCS
---
It is a bigger risk than normal and i am currently on break from game but these news suck to me
---
Nah, dialogue is a good thing. But it's fair to poke fun at it when it has "jumped the shark". I ardently hope CCP can get botting and input broadcasting under control. I also believe in avoiding publicly attacking them for not doing enough. We all want them to do well. Calling them names and being mean about it won't fix it.
---
No collusion 
---
tl;dr - dudes that wanted to skilled themselves. those that didnt want, to didnt.
---
apparently someone who can speak the english language
---
Life continues to settle down in the drone regions?
---
However, the typing it out part could use some work I guess?
---
&gt; If you‚Äôre an alliance or coalition leader, don‚Äôt harbour these people. If you‚Äôre renting space to an alliance, don‚Äôt rent to people who‚Äôre botting.
---
&gt; Several alliances have found this out the hard way recently.
---
The problem though is most of us already care and actively try to remove bots when we find them.  All this does is send the message that we might get fucked anyway if we miss any. 
---
Keep in mind, Alliance leaders have no access to server logs, and we take time away from playing a game we pay for to do the work of the security team.  I'm not saying I think I could do better in their shoes, I'm just saying if they can't do something I certainly can't do better with less.  Chances are TEST does a good enough job to be fine, we haven't lost any isk, but it still leaves a really sour taste in my mouth with the tone they set here.  My assumption has always been that CCP has more tools than I do, so if I'm not sure I'll leave the judgement call to them.  When did that become an unreasonable stance?
---
Just setup my own one man corp in a C3. Still working out the mechanics myself but man this shit is fun. Should have done it a long time ago. Feel free to send me any specific questions you have and I'll do my best to answer them. 
---
I'll mentor you, the package is worth 100billion but I'll sell it to you for 15billion. Comes with complete guides of wormholes, emergency scanning escapes, help to set up citadels, skype mentoring 24/7
---
What does that actually mean? What do you actually expect from alliance leaders? Rmt is a clear red line but ‚Äúharbouring botters‚Äù is really vague. If it means anything else than actively setting up bot farms themselves I have a hard time figuring out what you want them to do really. Feels like a cheap way to discharge your own responsibilities and redirect anger toward alliance management that are here to play a game and not police bots. 
---
A lot of people post here that they reported "bots" but they aren't banned and ask why. When they explain what happened, people tell them that they're obviously humans and not bots and that's why they aren't banned. That's why people get flagged without running a bot. Mistakes happen - we're humans after all and all of us make mistakes.
---
I like how logging on is allowed, when it offers a direct tangible in-game advantage.
---
For the hookbill, try using either an enduring warp disruptor or a compact disruptor. It's less range, but it's also significantly less CPU, and in the case of the enduring one, much less cap. Try a regolith shield extender instead of the tech 2 one. With a regolith, CPU rig instead of the extender rig, and a compact disruptor, you may have enough CPU to fit a pair of compact sensor dampeners (use targeting range scripts in them). Makes it hard for other frigates to even lock you for damage as you vroom around them. 
---
alot of words without any information what you actually want to do.
---
why wormholes?
---
is it mainly a newbro-corp? or are you recruiting high-skilled players?
---
do you mainly want to pve? if yes, do you have multiple high-skilled accounts? do you want to farm with dreads? or just occasionally dualbox rattles? or do you only have a single char to pve with?
---
do you want to pvp? if yes big brawls, or mainly smallgang/ganks?
---
or arent you interested in that at all and just want easy null/lowsec access?
---
with the information you gave us, i can only direct you to read all of the wh-wiki since i have no clue what you actually want to do except the ''i want to do wormhole stuff''
---
You can just decline the missions that have you shooting player factions.
---
Happy birthday u/StainGuy
---
Understandable. I realize that this is not a concretely practical idea, as I have no idea as to whether or not CCP could implement such automation to do a first round detection. I really just put this idea out there to see if anyone thought it was interesting, not 'hey let's do this right now' kind of thing. 
---
Appreciate your feedback.
---
Now this is shitposting
---
He doesn't sub them himself. Banning him would improve the economy because players unsub when he camps regions.

Nullsec.
---
Rats start lighting cynos and dropping dreads and carriers with fax support on the poor mining fleets.
---
Mining fleets now consist of Hels, faxes, rorquals and skiffs. Everyone in the ore site are getting 120. Mil ticks.
---
Ore prices skyrocket. Prices of excavators drop as it's too risky to use them. And mining fleets now consist of a rorqual, 40 skiffs and a 20 man capital fleet. 
---
I have reported bots and seen NOTHING done about them as have several other players. It is frustrating to us that we clearly know they are bots and can give you all the evidence but, we get no acknowledgement and they continue on botting with no action what so ever. Some for months and others for year's. Why is this? You say you care and are making all this head way but, the same bots are still going. It gives the whole community the impression that you do not really care. We know your enforcement resources are limited but, when we do alot of the work for you there is no excuse.
---
I mean, that was information I didn't specifically know to provide.
---
Corp is Newbro friendly, but highly skilled players are obviously desired.
---
I want as much self-sufficiency inside the WH as possible. I'm unfamiliar with WH PvE, though I understand the loot is involved in industry to some degree (unless I'm woefully mistaken). 
---
From the talks I've had with a number of people, a C2 with a HS static for logistics seems like a good starting point, though that High Sec access provides ample opportunity for harassment from outside. Null Access would be interesting, due the opportunities there. In any case, having a C2 with caps inside provides a nice "home field advantage" for defense of the hole and infrastructure within it.
---
Again, I gave little information because these are all things that I'm still learning about and deciding on. Learning to Pros and Cons of each possible course is a big first step that I'm trying to take.
---
Is this so you can bring your Raven to the fleet?  
---
Funny man is funny
---
Bans for (suspected) hacks, and account recovery from actual hacks, are the slowest thing to get support on. You're not being helped by the low-level GMs, you're in a queue that's waiting on a limited number of CCP people to look at.
---
Get 2FA and secure your shit, or take the risks.
---
EVE 101
---
ANY multibox rorqs are just having very fast hands when they recall their excavators in 15 clients at same time.
---
BUT that dude who activate 7 booshers when stealing excavators is definitely input broadcasting! Even he recorded and uploaded what exactly he did on youtube, that's just camouflage! He should be banned!
---
Learn this from heart before you continuing this game.
---
Same here man, I will test this but I've always been pretty sure core probes made for easier scanning
---
Ccp did an extensive bot investigation (checked to see if acct was paid). Found nothing. But hey, some new skins are available in the store!
---
It's be interesting, and crucially, it'd be engaging for more than one (or zero) person if it required a group to do. Group PVE is the only thing that can or could redeem us from the botting menace and the scourge of tedious gameplay.
---
I mean.. if that dude can activate 7 booshes on 7 accounts and the rorqual can't recall four sets of drones across 4 accounts... that does seem a little sketchy to me!
---
Yup.
---
Not to mention all the loss mails üëå
---
Well I learned something thanks.
---
Well yeah dude that sucks. Hopefully there's something that can be done
---
Literally go join an established wormhole group. You are going to learn much faster that way. Then bail and start your own corp. You can read wiki and reddit all day, but there are some things that can‚Äôt be learned like that. You‚Äôll also get easier/faster access and hands on experience. 
---
Lots of us love being that guy who can explain stuff properly to interested newbros, just ask in large public channels like bombers bar or spectre fleet and I can almost guarantee you'll get plenty of help. Once you get good at it exploration can get really profitable and is quite fun, sansha and gurista relic sites in WH space and nullsec can easily make you 100 million isk per hour.
---
ETA 2 years don't worry
---
Problem being, spodbrains keep petitioning for that dude be banned for input broadcasting, while having perfect excuses when they achieve similar thing by so called high APM.
---

I mean, I 100% understand that reasoning, but I simply despise being a nobody in somebody else's Corp. I started my own Corp for the same reasons that I started my own business IRL.

I'm not dismissing the suggestion, by any means, but suffice it to say that it's not my desired course.

Nice strawman but you ever consider getting some friends?

Problem is that it's really hard to detect input broadcasting and differentiate it from simply high APM without software level change, and I don't see CCP will invest any resource into it in short term.

It's only a matter of time before someone uses BB in a personal vendetta, but I mean if it creates content then sure if it doesnt then have a chat.

Replace the MSE with a caldari navy SSE. Then use t2 cpu rig. This allows you to fit a DCU, which gives you 300 more EHP than your MSE fit. SSE gives you a smaller sig as well (not by much, but still).
---
If you have isk, then you could use an 'interruptive' point which saves a bunch of CPU and has the same cap enduring and same point range as T2. This allows you to T2 the BCU and DCU and gives you about 600 more EHP over the MSE fit. But, the 'interruptive' point is 55-60m, so probably not worth it. 
---
Wish storyline mods were cheaper for exactly this reason. If they were 10-15m and not competing with faction mods, they'd be great for tight fits like this.

Alright, to be honest those fits will all die very easily.

Perhaps you're right. It's something that I'll look into.

Sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy the show. 
---
My Runglish is not good enough for you :(
---
You must be upset a lot of the time...
---
&gt; My dear friend, i think this statement of yours cuts both ways.
---
&gt; Maybe i am a stupid, slow and unskilled carebear. Ratting, mining and having fun while doing all this stuff you consider dull and stupid. You know what i consider stupid? Playing a game while not having fun. But at the same time, i love EvE to bits as well as you do.
---
&gt; Isn't this supposed to be the beauty of this game? To let everyone play the way they want to? If i want to farm ISK like there is no tomorrow in a stable corp with the backing of a strongest federation in the game, why should i not be alowed to try and should you not be allowed to try and disrupt our farming?
---
&gt; I am not saying what you are doing is wrong. You are playing the game as it suits you. And so are we.
---
I don't have a problem with carebearing as an activity. But this game is designed with a premise that there are higher and lower risk activities. And the higher risk activities require more creativity, intelligence, and still have inherent risk, but are more rewarding. Mechanics I often complain about are mechanics which disrupt this premise. The highest end carebearing is also completely risk-free, skill free, intelligence-free. These are broken balance issues that mainly is a CCP problem. But they become a Goon problem when they begin shitting on people raising these issues etc.
---
Debatable
---
popcorn.gif
---
&gt; so multiboxing alpha account with their omega main?
---
you can do this without multiboxing the alpha, using bookmarks
---
Using BB as a weapon against someone... other than Imperium you mean? THE HORROR!
---
Your best bet is to join a newbro friendly corp like Karmafleet. The best of Goons (and maybe the whole game) with regards to exploration are in Karmafleet.
---
And make a bot that warps suspected bots to a random system .. instant content even if you have a false positive ^^ I mean a random enemy ratting titan or so in your home system ... just saying 
---
So join the corp and don't be a nobody? It doesn't take long if you put in the effort. For example if you join a decent wormhole group and you are immediately vocal and trying to learn while using whatever they teach you to try to find content you will quickly drop that nobody status. Understandable if it isn't something you want to do, but it would be 100% the fastest way into understanding how to run your own wormhole corp. 
---
Have you tried joining discord wormhole channels like Praisebob instead of having your own wormhole channel? Start poking around in there, there's over 150 wormholers in there on average (and another solid 150 non wormholers), granted they might not all talk or be helpful for your cause, but it gives you an idea of how it could be a valuable resource.
---
It's really hard to help you understand wormholes without knowing what you already know and doing a lot of q&amp;a on the topic which would better be suited for more live chat type of conversations. As far as running an actual corp in wormholes, that's a really tough question as running a corp anywhere in eve can be a challenge, every single one is unique (as i'm sure you know).
---
CSM expected to uphold emergency announcement?
---
Botting L4 distribution missions on alphas was super common.
---
You still need to give them direction and focus their creativity. As a ceo you need to LEAD. You can't just recruit a bunch of people, you must have goals for your group. Anyway it's something you will learn in time.
---
No CCP doesnt like them and are not profiting from bots, you just had bad luck
---
Sounds like a dream job to me
---
&gt; ccp wants bots because they buy plex
---
kind of a double edged sword, though.
---
plex prices go up, it squeezes profits for RMTers. that means RMTers have to expand their bot farms to farm more isk, so they can sell more isk, so they can sustain their profits. with free alphas, the investment for extra bot characters is... nothing, which I imagine makes said farms easy to expand.
---
if this isn't art, then art is dead
---
video is too long, can you just tl;dr me what happened?
---
Marshy has been using Bombers Bar for his personal profit for a long time.
---
Didn't realize, makes sense though. That's a shame, plenty of people use alphas for pulling level 4 missions for their omega runners. 
---
&gt; Perhaps the botting ships won‚Äôt notice and get nuked.
---
They added dread spawns to anoms, bots died for a little while then were programmed to run from them. Even if you make the "enraged" NPC have no distinguishing name or ID, a bot can still monitor the damage it's taking fairly easily. This would kill far more legit players than bots.

but i found this video worth posting in some degree while i am making it. At least not many people AFK PVP in blingy ships.    
---
if u found 16mins of this video not entertaining at all, i apologize.     
---
Also, TRYRM is recruiting!   [https://zkillboard.com/kill/72977771/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=ErVyH5TmeX8&amp;event=video_description&amp;redir_token=k-03L_5BmLX1UeVJF43aplbIwmx8MTU1MDY4MzA5OEAxNTUwNTk2Njk4&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fzkillboard.com%2Fkill%2F72977771%2F)   
---
for those who found video too long,
---
tl;dr :
---
i went afk while pvping in my 1.7b + &gt;1b pod sleipnir.
---
and i won even after my shield booster was off. because the target lost his will to fight any more. 
---
plus some entertaining moments in comms. 
---
How much you got for 3tril? Did you bulk sell it? 
---
yes i just did in my comment below.
---
I feel you dude I'm a wormholer I know about collateral damage haha
---
STU ITS BEEN SO LONG üòÇ
---
This kind of thing has been going on for awhile. When I saw this I thought "finally" and then realised it wasn't even who I was thinking of

You should probably read this.

Pretty good advice from a WH corp CEO

Hey it me ur cousin 
---
They already did ban proven broadcasters, and the most prominent case was ... oh wonder... a goon. Gaaras 50 cynos in one server tick ... you remember? But i am sure the pulling of excavators on close to 50 Rorquals was just done by high APM ...
---
Thank you
---
Because they didnt ban 4k bots. Thats why they wont publish a list.
---
I have a rather expansive english vocabulary but I had to look up their use of the word "brook."
---
TIL brook = tolerate.
---
I can sell you a Heron even 40M cheaper than an [Astero](https://evemarketer.com/types/33468). Interested?
---
You can always start at 4 AU. 8 or more may give an overview in wormholes with very many sigs, otherwise it's not useful. Going two steps down requires good skills, though. Without good pinpointing, you are faster with single steps.
---
If a region is not farmed equally everywhere, you usually have empty "highways" and some pockets, where the sites are concentrating. That's not so much caused by some newbies (which are not very efficient anyways and don't run lots of sites), more by experienced explorers and the exploration bots. Core informaion: There is absolutely no point in going to places like Omist and hope for a higher concentration because it's far away from any civilization. Sites are not denser there than in Tenal, which is close to Jita.
---
Drama Bar X btw
---
If they said he was broadcasting and banned him, good. I have no qualms with that at all.
---
i cannot indentify as a single thing , i am just another EVE player loving the game willing to go forward to help where i have to be  i could be in hig sec , wh , low or null and i still love the game the same way 
---
.. been doing totally by accident.  Yes.
---
4k bans are bullshit. They wont publish a list so we cant verify. But obviously, to some extent we can verify, and when we do, its pretty much always the same - the bots are still around!
---
Woooo fuck it up CowKiller
---
I will share this again.  Some disagree with me so take it with a grain of salt.  I can scan almost all sigs from a VNI using this cube formation I came up with.   I use ALT and scroll or CTRL and scroll to adjust size and spacing of the probes.  I save the formation at 8 au as a starting point.  Using this on a proper scan ship I can get most sigs in 2 or maybe 3 scans. 
---
[https://imgur.com/jBHLUAC](https://imgur.com/jBHLUAC)
---
Centering probes on sig will help ALOT!!!  double click sig in list to center the map.  adjust and scroll in and then double click the map to flip orientation and center and scroll again. repeat until probes are centered on sig at max zoom in for that final scan. 
---
Excav Booshing is so called "chain booshing" (just ask Pando -.-).
---
It even makes no sense at all to activate all 7 booshers at the same time. You have to do it timed in a chain.
---
Different thing is when Excav BOMBING is synchronized, that has a high potential for broadcasting too (and off course should also be punished)
---
That's cool bruh.  Us Pathfinders will keep doing it better than everyone else then, haha.
---
so much salty tapirium around
---
but... ur not actually afk? Im confused
---
Bombers Bar more like Bombers Barf
---
I feel like you could of just AB'd out of scram range of the domi when you needed to leave.
---
Also, why are you keeping at range on a battleship in an AB BC? Orbit outside of SB range, then you could of put drones on the nemesis and not lost all your drones. Plus you'd be at a range where grapple isn't as strong, easier to extract.
---
I really really really need the J-number
---
Marshy is obviously not happy someone else is using his personal weapon.
---
[All done](https://i.imgur.com/bAl8SqJ.png)
---
I forgot this isn't even something that needs to be programmatically done, obviously makes it easier though especially for large corporations. 
---
You can use a pivot table in excel which will group the total occurrences. I took 100 transactions and changed them to be bounty payouts as well as adding names. 
---
This took me all of 10 minutes, most of which was trying to recall how to group repeat occurrences together and changing my own transactions since I don't rat cause I don't hate my life **that** much. 
---
Programmatically you would go through and keep a database with the occurrences when someone has been taxed for a bounty and then later perform a similar analysis of it to find people who are ratting for say 16 hours or more a day consistently and then manually investigate this. 
---
I would be more than happy to actually do this if someone gave me access to the information. 
---
oh, i am. in the mid fight for like 10mins. 
---
u can see it when mouse stopped moving. 
---
i should have put more clear description about that, sry. 
---
Now this is shitposting!
---
Im so glad I got my deployment notice, Made me get my stuff out of BB astra for my inevitable hiatus. XD
---
You COULD rent from Goons as well.  Talk to "Sadus" in-game.
---
mar5hy has spent too long in delve and has caught spinitis. gotta spin to win
---
I can see that being an issue. 
---
Don't add an acquisition array, the scan time is plenty short anyway.  Add rangefinding if you want, although after something like 105 points? it's just going to speed up how quickly you get a location or an ID.  Mid-90s are fine for almost everything.
---
High probe strength makes a huge difference when you're scanning down a dozen anomalies, but not so much when you're scanning 2 or 3.  If I can ID and filter out the gas sites at 8 or 4 AU things go much more quickly.
---
&gt;Alliance leaders who are harboring botters are going to get theirs eventually when they get found out.
---
Are you fucking pretending you dont already "know"?
---
CCP aren't the Gestapo, it seemed from the thread pretty obvious the owner took it down by his own accord.
---
Oh this is stitch &lt;3
---
yeah you are right, i should have at least tried to pull range before i went afk.
---
my corpmate actually told me to do it. i doubted when domi was 0 even when i was keeping range 500m. 
---

Oversight, sorry! I banned a bunch of Asteros and what-have-yous doing exploration. 
---
Also lots of mining Apocs... The Amarr Navy would be disgusted. 
---
metoo!
---
Yeah, I think this is all very reasonable. Maybe there is some sort of ‚Äúbest efforts‚Äù policy baked into the system where they see you‚Äôre filing reports and kicking people you‚Äôve reported, etc. No idea if it‚Äôs that fine-grained, but it really should be if they‚Äôre looking to automate the system to a significant degree.
---
emails to [security@ccpgames.com](mailto:security@ccpgames.com) \- it'll probably get read and looked at within a day or two at the most, mon-fri though. i wish i had the time to reply to all of the mails.

You can be a nobody in your corp and learn slow or you can be a nobody in their corp and learn fast.

One of them leads to you being not a nobody in your corp faster.

---
I think the only thing your guys SeAT didnt ask for was blood type and the credit card number the player used to fund the account. I have been in multiple alliances, large and small including goons. No one ask for that amount of stuff. 
---
I am not against intel, but what you guys asked permissions for was over the top. Might as well of handed you the account.
---
I was only with Ray's corp for a few months, but i strongly disagree with your botting accusation. As a person who idles while at work a lot, i personally watched and talked to him while living in Period Basis. Not once did I ever see signs of botting, just a guy mining while working from home. There are plenty of botters in Delve, he is not one of them.
---
I seen the chats between him and Weistel, and those two simply did not get a long what so ever. I however never seen anything to make me suspicious that Ray was not delivering on orders and scamming people, and would have left had I thought he was. I know the orders I did with him went smoothly and never ran into any problems apart from a couple delays, but in his defense, he was building a Titan or two at the time. I do know some deposits were taken, and items never delivered. This was at the request of RMC's leadership and had their approval. Spies or something, I dont remember the exact reason.
---
As a person who frequents his streams, has won stuff without being a subscriber, I cant say if his method of doing stuff is wrong. I dont know enough about Twitch. I also only looked at his store once, and never compared prices or anything. Why would I? I get RP just for being there..
---
TLDR: Seems like a lot of accusations are being throw around without any substantial proof. As a person who was in corp with Ray, I never seen any wrong doing or scamming (that did have RMC's approval) or was made to suspect any was being done. 
---
I don't understand, what does any of this have to do with a GM? CowKiller took control of a chat channel using in game chat channel mechanics right?
---
If the owner didn't want to risk losing control of the channel then only set people as ops not fellow owners!
---
That's the first thing that came to my mind aswell. Marshy is literally using BB for his personal profit for a long time now. But can't have another fc take away his personal army, eh? The Ironie.
---
Didn't Mar5hy use his fleet of Don Trollone's plus Bomber's Bar as a weapon against an alliance for a 1Bil per System Contract?
---
When ISK is involved it's ok..but when it's personal...fuck Cowkiller?
---
I'm being told by my corp that I'm confusing the private entity known as Mar5hy, not the neutral Mar5hy part of the neutral entity Bomber's Bar...but I personally see zero difference.
---
God, Mar5hy makes me laugh...
---
We might be such a minority that we dont have to worry. CCP can swing the banhammer rather freely.
---
ty
---
so ur not afk pvping, but pvping and then going afk...?
---
Then whats the point
---
That is soo true 
---
am not goon btw
---
i use 2FA, turdburglar.
---
He camped Esoteria for over a month. His rate is apparently 1bil per system per month. He has a toon in all 85 systems of Esoteria. Do the math.
---
Mar5hy is stupidly neutral when ISK isn't involved...but the moment ISK is there...he is bought on a side.
---
Don't get me wrong, I dislike all idea topics in /r/eve.
---
well i have to be at least not being afk to start the pvp. 
---
i dont see your point.
---
But who is paying him to do fuck all in Delve?
---
Excellent. Stopping bots has got to be a community effort if it's going to work. I'm sure Mittens will revise his position.
---
this kills the Horde.
---
remember when you posted a video where you had t2 webs on your bhaal because you couldn't afford faction
---
how the times change 
---
Cornak4CSM
---
The Abyssal space is a PVP arena under test. They probably have a lot more going on in there than what we see.
---
hehe, thanks for remembering :)) 
---
What ship are you flying, what are you trying to accomplish, and what are you doing?
---
Shadow cartel alliance/mbloc corp. 
---
Need drugs good ones! Be our ‚ô§
---
Good to hear. I must admit I stopped seeing some of the regular bots around the north.
---
Problem is new ones emerged, hopefully at lower rate.
---
Upvote.
---
The article on FW updates is deeply moving. 
---
Bombers Bar needs to reform under a new banner with new leadership - Mar5hy has lost it and it‚Äôs time for the door.
---
Damn... logic is sound with this one... I'll send over everything I have, all of 2 isk :/ I'm poor please double it
---
If it looks that you are doing something dumb - then don't do it.     
---
It is so simple.         
---
Remember that each time you are undocking you are agreeing to lose everything on this ship. 
---
Mainly mining barges and exhumed, every now and again an expedition frigate. 
---
Change bounty to something like blue loot in which space? This way botters will loose not only their ship but also the income from last X sites Sherry being killed
---
He‚Äôs camping Delve right now so your argument is invalid.
---
Want to start seeding freighters? ;-P
---
Run it through Google translate again. You'll get it. Maybe. 
---
The BB fleets I've been participating so far jtuat roll into whatever region the dice suggest and whale there.
---
So you mean WHs are plotting against whoever you thing they are plotting against?
---
Given your massive boner for ISboxer and wholly irrational frothing at the mouth defense of it, I've learned just not to bother engaging with you on the subject given how you try to twist basically everything that's said about it to fit your own weird narrative about how having multiple monitors when playing EVE is unfair so people should be allowed to multiplex.
---
So yeah, whatevs broski, keep fighting the good fight.
---
*points to the northern prats*
---
Damn brother you can throw down!!!

Give this man a crown

He just made Jibberish frown

Shark week just drown

Under the weight of literacy and renown
---
I'm not suggesting they police the game. I'm suggesting they don't harbour people who're botting, and that they report them so that we can police the game. Entirely different.
---
I'm not asking that they run around and ban people, so your comment is pretty much entirely irrelevant.
---
More posts on Reddit shittalking about CCP been sold to Koreans
---
several months. FRT paid him. 
---
Absolutely nothing.
---
You wouldn't want to play my version of EVE, because it'd be 1000% more savage than today, with empire split into four and massive carnage on the other side of every  stargate.
---
Sweet, I have no problem losing ships. But I figure if I have an issue I should seek to prevent it myself. Losing ships only hurts my bottom line and I don't loose ships enough to bankrupt me. Just trying to make more money is all. 
---
I am not upset either, I think it's a fair tactic, I just want to be able to "defend" myself or have a ship and fit that is able too. If those bankers hit the bot miners I am fine with it, heck that help out my bottom line. 
---
I'm not gonna lie, lots of job satisfaction right here.
---
Mainly because no matter how much shit you guys fling at me, I still love you all.
---
He did that fuck all in Esoteria for about 50 days on Fraternitiy's dime. I think he was in an ISK hole ship-wise when he left since he lost more bombers then he was able to kill in Capitals. Subcapitals roamed pretty much freely. He became a part of the wallpaper after about 15 days and lost a ton of bombers to Legacy response fleets.
---
Idk who is paying him for Delve. Drum up who your enemies are with loads of cash and they might be your contractor.
---
Imagine barely having the money to have a super fleet and then paying some dude to kill useless people in another region
---
I'll copypasta my previous comment on this:
---
&gt; I'm not suggesting they police the game. I'm suggesting they don't harbour people who're botting, and that they report them so that we can police the game. Entirely different.
---
&gt; I'm not asking that they run around and ban people, so your comment is pretty much entirely irrelevant.
---
Boot people who you believe are botting, or don't rent space to them, and report them, that way we can slice them up.
---
Simple really.
---
&gt;Drum up who your enemies are with loads of cash and they might be your contractor.
---
I don't think goons have enemies with loads of cash
---
Nah, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm always trying to concentrate on positive things, also I believe that EVE is too unique to go dead suddenly. It‚Äôs just that I heard so much shittalk about game turning to p2w crap ‚Äì made me think if it has something behind it 
---
&lt;3
---
And this right here is why I love you falcon.
---
What ships (by name) are you flying, what are you trying to accomplish (with each ship), and where are you doing it?
---
please actually answer the questions this time so i can help you.
---
Not specifically targeting you, just answered your question
---
Most ganks work because the ganker gets to choose his target.  So it doesn't matter really what your EHP is but rather how juicy a target you look to them.  So cheap frigs to battleships are ignored because it isn't worth their time.  So are heavily tanked ships like procurers that aren't worth much.  But when you fly a ship like the hulk or mackinaw in hisec, you will be targeted as you have little tank and the killmail is worth it to the ganker (who is also out one or more ships). 
---
If I didn't care about botting in EVE, then I wouldn't give a shit about EVE.
---
If I didn't give a shit about EVE, I wouldn't be working for CCP. 
---
We're working as fast as we can to clean these guys out, it takes time when there's thousands of them, mutiple reports for every one of them, and only a handful of us.
---
It's pretty simple math.
---
&lt;3 
---
&gt;I'd like to try to use one for a Sentient Burst Jammer if possible for emergencies. (for all the good it may do)
---
This is something that sounds like a good idea but in practice just prevents you from jumping due to the weapon timer.
---
Yeah, just realized that
---
We love you too bby ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Does Cowkiller use asic miners?
---
Ah, yes, because the customer should absolutely be forced to do the job of the company for the company.  
---
I guess I didn't explain what I wanted. I want to survive while mining for about 20ish seconds until Concord arrives and takes care of them while in High Sec. Simply against a solo player, not a group, if I get hit by a group I know I will loose my ship. At least maximize my chances of survival at least. 
---
&gt;Is there any serious signs of turning it into p2w?
---
nope.
---
Jojoba
---
stick to procurers.
---
they're cheap and disposable, and there are much easier targets.
---
fuck you, cunt
---
cool thing about CSM. players can vote for more than one candidate. If Goons can get five in, I'm sure TEST can figure a way to get two or three :)
---
man, you're not answering the questions in the format i asked, and are not giving me enough information. read my other post
---
&gt; Alliance leaders who are harboring botters are going to get theirs eventually when they get found out. Doesn't matter what flag they fly.
---

Pls comeback to the Cesspit. Its so boring without you.

No

---
If you actually want answers to your question, you will pay attention to /u/globbyrebornASS 
---
Like so many other people have said, just fly procurers or skiffs. Procurers just aren‚Äôt worth ganking tbh.
---
I still love you too Chevis, even though your posting is pure 100% distilled anus.
---
Git outta here with that gay shit
---
Why can't mom and dad just get along? 
---
One could say that this has had an impact.. bust mostly on /r/Eve and less on the game.
---
hes been there that long he has started spod mining
---
Not so much pay to win, rather pay to catch up with veterans. Skill trading is a relatively new thing, I'll leave you to form your own opinions about it! The community is still brilliant although I find it quite a bit more aggressive than it was.
---
Yeah. Because loggin in with ISboxer is not something someone could manage without ISBoxer, right? He probably totaly fail to click the login button.
---
I don't blame Goons for playing their playstyle the best way they can.
---
The issue is when they shit on balance concerns like what I present in this topic. I've been struggling to raise them for 3 years now pissing against all the toxicity I receive.
---
Wew, you put spaces between it to try and add even more ~edge~
---
gg
---
Pink skins.
---
Ah, yes, because paying customers should be the ones doing the jobs of paid employees and facing consequences for their failure to do so without the tools to actively do the job.
---
That is how you win! Good for you!
---
What did I just read
---
&gt; wholly irrational frothing at the mouth defense of it
---
Because of CCP irrational frothing at the mouth hatred of it and anyone who uses it. I send you and company an email on the first day of the announced ban asking to sit down to discuss some grey areas and wording hiccups. Radio silence. I attempted to defend ISBoxer on the forums, only to eat a permaban because I was tired of the personal attacks from people on the forums calling me all sorts of names.  
---
&gt;  I've learned just not to bother engaging with you on the subject given how you try to twist basically everything that's said  
---
When have I twisted everything that's said? I point out edge cases, grey areas, and piss-poor wording that can be exploited by hostile entities in-game to ban rivals (such as KunMi) or where the GM team has historically little training and conflicting rulings on.  
---
&gt; how having multiple monitors when playing EVE is unfair  
---
No, I was pointing out how it could be construed as an unfair advantage as defined by CCP's wording, and had originally asked for clarification only to be insulted by you.  
---
You still didn't answer the question about when KunMI, aka oodell, was multiboxing his bombers and was mass-reported, so a GM decided to temp ban him because he was causing too much trouble for you despite not input broadcasting. 
---
When you have the isk all you have to do is make a new toon and inject it. They lose almost 0 progress after the ban.
---
On the one hand, you're a good dude and I want to give you my vote... On the other hand I don't want to give the Spanish community more representation than is absolutely necessary, IE none.
---
Well, some wallets up north have lots of cash at least, iykwim.
---
So if I suspect I may be ganked then switch to my procurer or skiff. So no real point to tank fit the better yield mining vessels.
---
Your other post wasn't in my feed when I posted this. 
---
His other post wasn't in my feed when I posted this.

I would vote for you for CSM, with a platform like that. :)

Thank you for this incredible post. If only you had more influence the EVE I knew would still be intact. These are the core principles of EVE, in my opinion, and they have all been compromised:
---
- **EVE is a dark and dangerous place where real world morality is a hindrance** (eroded by forbidding gambling, pornography, foul language, "harassment", and generally making the place teen-rated)
---
- **you can attack anybody at any time anywhere and, in turn, can never be safe** (eroded by tethering, private instanced abyssal deadspace, timezone-tanking sov and structures, wardec immunity, and friendly-fire-illegal corps set to default)
---
- **loss is permanent** (eroded by asset safety)
---
- **skills cannot be bought or traded** (destroyed by skill injectors which also enabled rampant botting)
---
- **every player is invested in the game because they pay money for a sub or are successful enough to generate an equivalent amount of in-game currency** (eroded by F2P Alpha, low-risk farming, and botting)
---
These principles *were* what create a sense of immersion and value for the players. They were equalizers that kept things in balance.  If you were clever enough to avoid all the hazards then you could really be proud of yourself, and this created a strong sense of investment. If you broke the game rules you'd risk losing your considerable time investment. 
---
Mmmmm
---
You're adopted
---
Hmm. I guess he was such a piece of the wallpaper that I thought it was shorter than it was.
---
Me too. Been hoping for a 'Cruisers of EVE' ever since the frigate book came out.  
---
Hi welcome to eve
---
Sounds likely actually
---
ITT: People arguing that FCing fleets to specific places (true or not) and holding a large NPSI community's main channel hostage for a personal vendetta (killing Eve community) are the same thing.
---
You just described eve
---
 &gt;investing in it
---
Thanks for the chuckle mate
---
It is really good at kiting other t1/faction frigates, and can probably handle t2 frigs alright. Not so sure how well they can handle destroyers, though i'm sure it would present a much bigger challenge.
---
Absolutely, if we could require 2fa to join TEST we would but there is no way to verify it. 
---
IKR?! It's literally why TEST was laughing at the salty panda tears

&gt;simply despise being a nobody in somebody else's Corp

where is my Blockade runner again?
---
Any place that has that many people is better to get info out of than an in game chat channel you make on your own.
---
So what you're telling me is that r/eve ... has jumped the shark.
---
Has this low effort trash post been destroyed yet?
---
Slow day at the empty office?
---
Start of the comment was great, then in the middle it sort of lost its way and became too serious, then the insult at the end just let it down.
---
3/10.
---
Talk to /u/ChevisPreston - he'll teach you how to insult people properly.
---
Do you even play the game?
---
Rats kill far more drones than players. 
---
They get hung up on rocks, people disconnect and the auto-recall doesn't quite work correctly. and yes, some get killed/booshed by players.
---
All in all, its just another day of eve, where shit happens.
---
Having planned for shit happening, like carrying extra fighters, or having extra drones, is just the old adage, "hope for the best, but plan for the worst".
---
At the end of the day, its just a flat tire.
---
Here is the Split: CAS members provide the major part of logistics that go into bombers bar fleets and lead people in and out the hole they are living in. Not every CAS member takes part in BB fleets, a small fracture of the BB members is part of CAS.. you could say that BB also is a recruitment pool for people who like to pvp more then just in BB.

Heil Jibrish

Hulk, for ore and ice mining. Mackinaw for when I don't feel like jet canning. Endurance when I want something different or are planning to WH mine later in the day. 
---
All mining I do is usually in .6 space that boarders on a low sec corridor, the corridor is frequented by PvPers and gankers. Ever now and again I mine in .9 sec space surrounded by high sec. If I am feeling risky then I mine in WH space, but am not worried about that too much. 
---
J121745. Keep in mind you can't bring Titans and supers into that WH. 
---
Funnily enough, I almost ran for the first CSM but then decided against it because I was too focused on just doing my thing and running my corp at the time.
---
I also became a vocal hater of the CSM while I was a player for a number of years. It was only when I came to CCP that my opinion of the council turned around after I saw how they interface with CCP from the other side of the fence.
---
If I ever left CCP at some point, I'd probably consider running because I know for a fact I'd go back to hardcore playing EVE haha
---
I mean, do it on a blinged scanner strat or t3 for sure. But this dude is fresh in a heron, he'll lose it to the first sabre he jumps into
---
/u/Jibrish wont text me back so its a constitutional crisis
---
I heard The Kalevala Expanse is a great space to rent
---
Ah, right. Yeah, that's a very fair point.
---
He wouldn't be standing there, as he avoids fighting at all costs.
---
I don't blame him for his playstyle, or knock it. This is Eve after all.
---
He is just delusional in his assumptions on how his actions affect others, that's all.
---
Nah, it's pretty busy actually, but replying from your phone is easy when you're bouncing between meetings and working on getting stuff done :) 
---
It's kinda after hours now anyway, gonna head home soon and scare another 10 kilos of shit out of myself with more Resident Evil 2.
---
I understand the tension from getting to work and being stuck in a long drawn out battle, which makes our focus a little fuzzy. At least you won :)
---
edited comment above, after i reviewed my video.
---
i normally wont reply to this kinda of criticism when i post this kind of meme-ish videos,

because i dont really care about people getting annoyed by my piloting skill when i posted this.

but i'm commenting because its the criticism from the guy of torpedo dreams. if its you actually.    
---
100% pure white columbian.

Yeah, it's something that I'm going to continue to push for, it's just a matter of getting it prioritised. 
---
oh lol u just replied when i added comment.
---
hey i &lt;3 u . loved ur vids.
---
yeah, i wouldnt get domi if i pulled range! : D
---
Yeah, this has been my experience too. It isn't literally someone payed to do tech stuff, but there are always people who know that around and are willing to help out (because it's fun for them).
---
Cacique Yuhasz is a corp treasure. Personally, I think the CSM could use a newer player perspective. I took him in with a few million SP, waived SP requirements and rolled the dice. It paid off. He's worked hard to get a fax alt, super and plex his own accounts. He pays $1 an hour just to get Internet to play Eve. If he's as dedicated to CSM and the Eve community as he's been to us, you'll have a CSM that listens to players and works hard for everyone's best interest. 
---
[Well......about that](https://i.imgur.com/ifFvtko.png)
---
You got my vote buddy!
---
So if I sell a botter a Titan I should lose my isk because according to ccp it's my job to know this? That's what they are saying but at an alliance level.

---
This is day what of mar5hy not being banned now?
---
As far as ideas go, this is actually excellent, you can make a bot do a lot of stuff like this. I would like to point out, that if CCP ever actually got such a tool, then they might or might not want to share this info with the public for fairly obvious reasons.
---
I would like Eve client to adhere more strictly to running from within a "main" OS if you will. Be it Windows, Mac or Linux. No VMs. Have some sort of detection built into the client. There may be a few players that run Eve on VMs, maybe some people at work here and there perhaps, but I bet its a super low number, whereas bots on the other hand is a relatively big percentage.
---
Next, not a confirmation tool, but rather a flagging tool if you will. Not one for definitive proof but just an additional flag to tack onto the existing ones based on clients IP. Most, if not all bots use VPNs. Either private (their own) or purchased service. 
---
So lets say you have 20 suspected bots, do traces, naturally they end up on VPNs and you get jack as their actual IP or physical location, etc. but there is a pattern to it. If an IP is for example XXX.YYY.ZZZ.WWW then the 20 bots will be something like XXX.YYY.ZZZ.233. XXX.YYY.ZZZ.234, XXX.YYY.ZZZ.235, XXX.YYY.ZZZ.236, XXX.YYY.ZZZ.237 etc. vast majority of the IP addresses will be all the same, except for maybe 1 or 2 digits in it, there is a pattern to it. Even if its being ran through a private VPN and rotates it daily or at interval of every several hours.
---
The other thing that is making things difficult is very simple. Eve is made to support multiboxing. Unfortunately, everything that is built and design to support multiboxing, is also good for the bots. Its that simple. The better multiboxing support it has, the friendlier it becomes for botting, its that simple. Make a decision, a cut off point, on how much multiboxing you actually want to have. Yes, it will affect some actual players. But it is by far the lesser of the 2 evils. Most people that multibox do not run more then a few clients at a time, unlike bots that will run 10, 20, 30, 50+. So determine that number and cut it off. 
---
Then ISBoxer, just remove it completely. There is no need for it. It literally takes me 1 minute, or less to start up 4 accounts, and thats typing in info each and every single time as I don't like using the "save" feature for obvious reasons. If you have up to 10 accounts then that is up to 2 minutes. It is really no big deal, and if you have more then 10 then either you're just as damaging to the game as a bot, or are just trolling and making false claims of actually playing while in fact you automate. Its that simple. So again, its the lesser of the two evils to completely remove it.
---
Next there are a lot of things in the game that are too automated. Address them, things such as drone auto agro, auto missiles, under options auto targeting back whatever targets you, the targeting computer modules. Removing these will of course not fix the issue, but why make it easier on the bots ?
---
On all missions, on the agents, every X missions or every X+-1 or X+-2, you can put a mini game. A quick one, if player passes it mission gives out a little bit more in terms of rewards such as faction and agent standings and whatever else that mission usually gives out. If player fails it, take a hit to the agent standing. Sure there is OCR but there are already ways to negate OCR as well, plenty of them and effective. And this will not affect PvP response times or anything, because its just PvE. If a bot fails the mini games too much, they will run out of agents or be scaled down to very low ones.
---
So stuff can be definetly done and improved and more importantly harder lines can be drawn between player / bots so it becomes easier to tell which is which, thus not having to let bots go without a ban because of legit players caught up in it due to false positives which come from the overlap. Minimize that overlap.
---
yeah, that's true.
---
bring your own lead gloves I guess 
---
But it‚Äôs important to know that an algos is bonused more for drones, not for hybrids that the catalyst uses. When I started eve I used a algos with an afterburner and armor repair module, then I‚Äôd salvage afterwards, using salvage modules on the algos.
---
Pretty much describes what TEST has done since moving to eso. 
---
One thing you are missing is protection. 
---
You have to protect your miners (aswell as you can) or they will just go to goons and your growth will slow drastically. 
---
Unless you are a renter,  protect your space. Caps, supers, Titans are a must else you will get kicked out. Having powerful friends is the best option, but you need some for yourself at some point.
---
Even a big group like TEST had to build rush 500  dreads in the first months of moving into Eso. 
---
what does bbtic know about living in wormholes? aren't you lowsec now? 
---
&gt; any serious signs of turning it into p2w
---
No, this game already is p2w since skill injectors were introduced.
---
It would be great if CCP could work on support for U2F services like [krypton](https://krypt.co/faq/).
---
Since 2FA codes can still be fished, U2F would further secure accounts against more elaborate schemes.
---
Plus U2F is just sexy in its ease of use.
---
&gt;He‚Äôs camping Delve right now so your argument is invalid. Also lol if you think he impacts groups in anyway.
---
Goons don't give a shit. And he does impact groups.
---
Toss that salad like his name Romaine
---
you as the gankee really don't get to choose whether or not the ganker goes though with it.  You can make it unattractive to him but really you just want to be ahead of the other guy.   Ala, the idea that "you don't need to be fast, just faster than the guy next to you" as the slowest person will get caught.  
---
Also just use T1 barges in highsec.  The T2 exhumers are much better used in null.  
---
Ideally you should get you're titan back and the money taken. 
---
He got a 7 days temp ban. CCP goes in a strike system. He burned his strike.
---
2/hs/3 is what you want. next consideration is good pi and moons for your indy stuff
---
hs static makes your life starting out easier. c3 static lets you farm efficient anomalies solo
---
you want a no effect wormhole tbh so you don't accidentally gimp yourself later on 
---
I guess I don't quite understand the purpose of this.
---
No offence intended, but it reads like a guide for 2003 nulsec conditions, when space was still unclaimed,  i.e. a little bit naive and impractical in current state of nulsec.
---
It isn't technically wrong, just not really useful as a guide.
---
everyone in my newb corp was complaining about the prices 
---
A lot of words, no plans, no actual ideas, no specific problems identified, no solutions.
---
It reads like a Miss Universe Pageant
---
‚Äú I believe in world peace and ending world hunger‚Äù
---
I guess he impacted bombers bar enough to failcascade... outside of that I‚Äôm not sure
---
I mean, to be fair, it's not exactly difficult to multibox 9 vni's or rorqs without botting/broadcasting, and giberrish names for those alts aren't exactly hard proof of a bannable offense. 
---
I'm not saying that they're *not* bots, but CCP can't ban people based on suspicion alone. 
---
If you mine in a hulk you have to pay attention, and leave as soon as you notice two or more catalysts on grid with you, or two or more flashies in local. If you're in a 0.6 you can survive two T2 Catalysts with the following fit ( https://i.imgur.com/1IBL70P.png ) even when pulled. [Implants only if you need fitting room]
---
The positive to highsec mining is it's ability to be AFK'd, so I'd stick with the Mackinaw and fit it like this ( https://i.imgur.com/bZKsPoY.png )
---
It would take 5 T2 catalysts to comfortably kill that, and you'd be mostly safe, I'd be surprised if you ever got ganked (unless you're super close to Josameto, Isanamo, Uedama, Niarja, or Gamis.) [Implants only if you need fitting room]
---
https://i.imgur.com/w1WweyR.png (Endurance fit)
---
Remember, the main allure of highsec mining is the ability to do it without having to pay attention for extremely long periods of time, so you want to maximize that part of it. If you want or don't mind paying attention, there are far better places to mine, or other activities to partake in alltogether.

Great advice! All the collective money and resources should stay inside the alliance to the fullest extent possible. Buy local, sell local, build local, and you enrich the collective. Jita is the home of the enemy.

Dramatic increase in doom and goom world is ending sky is falling shit posts on reddit which I suspect is paired with a big reduction in reddit site visits..

What kind of fit would be used? I‚Äôm guessing like a nullsec vni type fit, with a 100mn sig tank, and maybe a rep for emergencies?
---
At stage four, you need to start preparing to accept your loss. Short of a miracle, Stage 4 is pretty much terminal.
---
Sweet , door still closed?
---
Doubt it.
---
CCP declared mice connected with chopsticks and ducktape to be an exploit, so the bar is really low.
---
because CCP does not care about input broadcasting, in general.  A player cheating to actually play the game isn't nearly as interesting to them as a player who cheats to *not* play the game, and they can't even ban all of the latter, so...
---
Dude there's literally stuff going on in game RIGHT NOW related to this
---
As all real men do
---
gonna go shoot some ratties to get iskies for my toonies
---
You guys still running this line?
---
It really isn't though.  Most of us are completely at the mercy of whether or not our members or someone else sees a botter and then reports them to us.  Juggling the politics, organization, and maintenance duties of alliance leadership can be hard enough, without having to try and observe everyone's ratting habits under a microscope, let alone trying to spend the time to determine whether they are botting or autistic.  You've made the statement several times that you don't want us doing your job for you, but asking us to boot people is doing just that.  We as alliance leaders don't have the tools to be able to make those judgement reliably, and many of us are very cautious against wrongfully condemning someone and ruining their entire gameplay experience.  If I were going to lose all my stuff, I'd want it to be because an opposing faction took it through action, either military, subterfuge, or economic, not because a CEO felt pressured into making a rush decision that I was botting without any actual proof, and kicked me to protect his corp or alliance.  The only thing this does is fosters a stressful gameplay experience for all involved, except actual botters, as they'll just make a new account after theirs gets kicked or banned.
---
In addition to those issues, and despite the fact I know that your target alliance for this message are the alliances that openly harbor botters on an industrial scale, it very much feels like an ultimatum to alliance leaders to the job of policing botters "or else".  For the game devs to be making even a perceived implication of this to ordinary players is quite concerning.
---
Don't get me wrong, I find botting to be one of the most distasteful and harmful things in this game, and I want nothing more than to see it eradicated, but I also firmly believe that making alliance leaders the harbingers of that has the vast potential for harming innocent players.
---
Same reaction. What‚Äôs this for?
---
We do
---
100 ? Wow, I remember seeing 30, but still, that's more than convenient for BR runs. Is anyone mapping them, a bit like thera ?

people who aren't thin skinned babies who can choose not to be affected by words written by strangers on the internet
---
fuck you're a wuss
---
Yeah and it adds what, exactly, to the game, outside of a very small niche of people close enough to know where, when and how to get involved?
---
The drifter storyline started off being a huge thing affecting all parts of New Eden (think Jove observatories, unidentified WH appearances, the Empress' proclamation against drifters, her assassination, and all the new stuff that was REGULARLY APPEARING EVERYWHERE week on week to expand the story, the threat of drifters and the game as a whole), and now it's relegated to the occasional NPC structure POS bash from the sounds of it.
---
I don't necc dissgree.. But in a CovOps ship I don't need to jump.. I just need to warp and cloak.

No can‚Äôt do that kind of tanking in ded sites. Johnny Pew on YouTube I believe does some exploration and ded sites in a stratios. I‚Äôve never used a stratios for that purpose. You‚Äôd be limited in the difficulty of sites you could do for sure so I would just use a t3 cruiser instead. 
---
Besides the slightly aggressive intro it reads more like a showerthought with infos that everyone already has and figured out how to work with/around if they are capable of going into nullsec and drop a fortizar.

That's the thing about Horde. The quality of life of the line member is already so bad that it's hard for you to perceive *worse*. Case in point: have you noticed a difference since Horde lost the revenue of the Perimeter market? Things are the same at your level.

---
Bull-fucking-shit. You could buy a trained character, with millions of SP. You were not buying SP you inject into your own character. You were not PAYING for a clear advantage for yourself. That's a fundamental difference.

With the amount of drifter wormholes multiplying by more than a factor of 3, there's been numerous supercapital and rorqual losses in all regions of EVE that wouldn't have happened otherwise. If that doesn't affect a large amount of EVE then I don't know what does.
---

I'm not going into that argument again. If you can't see it, it's your problem. It doesn't affect reality we're in. A clear fact is - you can pay money to get a significant advantage over a fellow player ($$$ -&gt; PLEX -&gt; ISK -&gt; modules and SP). Sure, being a newbie you'll probably still lose to a veteran, but you'll wipe the fucking floor with another newbie. P2W.
---
Police officer here fighting IRL scammers. You're right! Investigating shit to not strike innocent is so human and time consuming that I can understand a game company is looking to automatize the process. 
---
Feel totally free to ignore the suggestions :) Feel free to insult them. It's a free reddit.
---
This. The less AFK stuff we have in the game the easier it will become to detect bots and the more obvious they become. Also, no reason to make botting itself easier for them.
---
Your intro comes off pretty dickish. Also, this reads like an ad on how to drive a car for some that has been driving for 40 years... and it was written by someone that takes the bus, but has watched cars drive by.
---
I have no idea what's going ITT but I think I like it.
---
What if the Titan has died, or I have spent the isk? 
---
like a bomber? 
---
It's not viable long term. If you pay all this money - im betting you're after making a name for yourself. In EVE you can't do that without building relationships. No amount of money buys that skill. 
---
And remember to get the milk/eggs/bread.
---
In EVE online, people pretty much multibox all of the time. Buying a character gives a clear advantage to yourself, the player sitting in the chair.
---
Buying a powerful character is still pay to win. Sure its not directly cash for power like it is now but you can't deny that it has existed for a very long time.
---
I'm not defending any of it btw, I think it is an awful part of the game and wish injectors never had been added.
---
Hi /u/NazAlGhul, idk who u r but were u aware that dng is recruiting?

 Is it really? Never done null mining, only WH mining. 
---
I don't think you understand
---
I do want to play in your EVE 
---
Question for you globby as I guess you've killed about a zillion miners, have you ever seen any miner attempt to use ECM drones to jam out a ganker?
---
IIRC ECM drones do not auto aggress so would not be useful for an afk miner, but for one paying attention and with destroyers having a relatively low sensor strength do you think they stand any significant chance of getting off a jam long enough for CONCORD to arrive on scene?

If there is a hell, and the more I play Eve the more I think there must be, it would have people doing captchas for eternity.  
---
They are awful.  
---
The company axed its community team, fired a ton of dudes so they could sell themselves to K-pop. Since then:
---
* Servers have gone to shit
---
* The new laggy XMP based chat desyncs every other time you check local. 
---
* They removed stations, making sov worthless. Citadel spam is now a valid tactic. 
---
* Also now its more cancer to evict someone than worth. Unless your autistic in which case there is always someone more autist than you. 
---
* They introduced the abyss, RNG is now an important part of the eco with no good way to market the shit. 
---
* Everyone has a titan alt that they wish they didn't.
---
* Botting in rampant, with full on RMT empires through EVE. Alliance leaders look the other way or actively defend it unless called out.
---
* EvE is still a blue donut. 
---
* Content in nullsec is invading highsec, or complaining about the taste of spod.
---
Mostly I just wanted to get some thoughts out of my head. 
---
No body cares about who is obliged to do what. All that is being said is that the current meta is bad for the game. As it is, less and less people roam and it's getting to the point where null sec is only for crabbing. This is bad for the game and is stagnating null sec beyond belief. But I imagine you spodbrain is too strong to see anything outside of your next 8 rorq alts.
---
Oh BURN!.. did you actually just call me a wuss hahahaha fuckin made my day dude.. :D

I have to ask... How do you respond to the allegations of you kicking puppies on the regular?

Definitely we lost the isk war hard but it was a matter of we had to try and push what we could do with the subs. 137 carriers really hurts especially when they had about 50-60 dreads in reserve to back the carriers up if we dropped.
---
"A modest proposal"
---
I chuckled
---
I understand what youre saying...its just not the actually solution to the problem you are perceiving.  It seems like your actual  problem is the effectiveness of subcapitals against capitals which is always a worth while discussion. Diminishing return should be a real factor affecting the choices between subcapital and capitals...but it doesn't mean capitals shouldn't still be better.
---

Does commanding a sweatshop to play your game also count as input broadcasting?
---
It might. But the guy who wrote the article could literally wipe out half of the null sec alliance's services with the stroke of his keyboard if he so chose. You dont realize how many sites rely on his market api.

Nope, we humped the shark.

Look, we all understand that Eve can be depressingly boring 80% of the time and full of salty autistic nerds who freak the hell out anytime you do anything remotely uncomfortable for their space pixels. Some of us play the game just to stir the ant hill and watch the people squirm.
---
Cacique is not that person. Wherever he is engaging with people, he's one of the most upbeat positive players I've ever come across in this game. Just seeing his "Hola" in chat puts a smile on my face, breaking up some of that crusty bittervet.
---
He is a breath of fresh air in a stale room, and I can think of no one better to put on the CSM for his attitude alone.

He doesn't have the years of "the way things are supposed to be" holding him back. He does offer a solid perspective and well thought out opinions in most conversations. He also buries himself into learning whatever he's pointed at, with surprising results.
---
He also makes one hell of a sandwich.
---
Cacique for CSM 2019 and beyond.
---
1. Buy a Casp/SC/Tit hull before changes
---
2. Recycle after T2 components hit.
---
3. Profit?
---
If you spent the isk you would be hit with a neg wallet, so you would have to sell the titan again to get well a non-negative wallet. 
---
If the titan has died that's the hard one because it's hard to roll back, without well reverting the kill and then it becomes a game of way to many rollbacks, that's why you can do this on alliance level but it's a pain to do on person level. 
---
You need a DST
---
That apparently translates into something important and should therefore be acceptable to be written in am asshole manner about things not in his field and taken as Gospel?
---
It is there for quite a while there is also one in a lowsec quite near this location ( in terms of capital jumps)
---
You're ass damaged because you just got called out for incorrectly accusing someone of botting when you didn't even get footage of them initiating their drone return commands. 
---
A reminder that he also used it against Legacy for Panda money. 
---
Should mod Naz TBH, all hail the supreme overlord of shitposts.
---
Are you on about abysal sites?
---
I don't feel comfortable discussing details like that. Eve might be dead in my eyes, but it was still a great game for a while, and I don't want to further contribute to its decline.
---
LOL that was my carrier you almost killed at the end. I had a feeling it was probably you guys. GG and sorry for no kill, I got lucky saved. Real silly on my part getting caught like that.
---
But you wrote it like it was important because you wrote it. So...
---
HORROR
---
tldr; crybabies who quit the game years ago stirred a bunch of pants-on-head conspiracy shit that hasn't happened and tried to make other players miserable and quit. Literally nothing has changed. 
---
&gt; I'd also go full scorched earth. You bot? You're screwed? You harbor botters and receive dirty ISK for them, we empty your wallet. Don't have enough ISK to pay back what you got illegally? Your keepstars and corp assets start vanishing. Zero tolerance. You collude in harming our game and community, we level you. Cut and dry.
---
Still sad that people like that get to keep doing it with no punishment. 
---
Is there any chance the community gets to see public records of who got the stick? At least for the nullsec alliances that use rmt/bots if not individual characters. 
---
God bless the slow children #redsouls
---
INSANITY
---
I meam, people calling people out for using their combat group to attack people is kind of funny. What's next? Calling out FCs for taking fleets out?
---
*Wooo* It's your **2nd Cakeday** eveonlined! ^(hug)
---
Im struggling to see the difference between buying a character and injecting skill points.
---
Hi
---
I'm originally a Gallente player back from the times when drones were complete shit, and unlike a lot of people on here and other places, I don't want to go back to those times. However, one thing that I think would be good, is to remove drone auto agro mechanic from the game entirely.
---
It is unnecessary for PvP. The only real situation in PvP that I have ever kept my drones on agro was when I was gate camping or in a plex in FW and expected company of the unfriendly kind to arrive. That is literally the only use of that feature in PvP. And I would not mind taking a hit on this at all.
---
On PvE, drone agro has more use due to some EWAR rats, the recent ECM changes do make things easier, which really leaves only stacked dampeners. If you can rework it so that drones still act normally vs the dampeners but do not agro any other situation, then I would also be perfectly willing to take the hit. 
---
As far as mob agro vs drones goes, this seems to be touchy because you guys unfortunately can never get it right. I do not know what the problem here is, maybe you do not have enough devs that actually play drone ships to get where the line should be, or maybe the available mechanics are not adequate to get the values correctly, but its always either too little or way too much, and sometimes its just plainly weird, never the right amount.
---
Next, the PvE itself. I submit to you, that its not necessarily drone ships that are OP, but rather that many turret ships that are so underpowered when it comes to PvE. Take Abyss as a great example of this. Yes, it can be done in turret ships, but look at the success rate of turret vs drone ships and more importantly, do some T5 filaments in turret ships vs drone ships. If you nerf drones without buffing the turret ships for PvE, then what will be left to run these in ? If you nerf the drones, then nerf the mobs to bring them to be easier for turret ships, then the drone ships will be back in the saddle again as all you will do is just move the line. So buffing turret ships for PvE is something you should take a great look at.
---
I love my Gallente ships and I love my Gila but they do get boring and when I have 2 characters that can fly almost all sub caps between them that are dedicated for PvE content I would actually like for something other then these to be optimal for a change, or at least to be on par or closer to it so that I have more options for different ship types available.
---
And incidentally, I don't think "nerf Gila" is the solution here when the issues are the mobs and AI as well as the general underperformance of turret ships.
---
 
---
Is there ever a purpose to these types of post? Everyone who is interested already knows where they are.
---
I'd much rather kick capsuleers in the nuts, it's more therapeutic. 
---
Probably one of the better solutions, in the long run, is to use User Behavior Analytics techniques look for telltale ‚Äòbehaviors‚Äô of bot accounts and flag them for review.  
---
CCP should have tons of data on what typical behavior ‚Äòreal‚Äô players and bot accounts are doing and then flag accounts that are doing suspicious things.  A lot of the analysis would be very hands off and automatic and would give high yield hits to security.  
---
I am not sure if MMOs use these systems, but they can work pretty well. 
---
In a CovOps if you need to break lock you fucked up a while ago.  If you can't warp sometimes the out is jumping or docking.  There are many more useful things that can go in that slot than a 1 shot hail mary.
---
If this was a "corp" we were talking about sure. I'm not "new" to Eve. I understand what's allowed and what isn't. Corps/backstabbing in corp is used for scamming/etc. That's allowed and encouraged in Eve. All fine.
---
**However, there is not monetary or gameplay related advantage to holding a chat channel used by a NPSI community, hostage. It's not even "meta gaming".**
---
Anyone in here wanna bet that CCP gives ownership back to someone other than CowKiller cause I'd gladly take that bet.
---
is he wrong?
---
it's too broad with no actual solutions to anything 
---
you mean ~~pickle~~ PiGgLe
---
&gt; you didn't even get footage of them initiating their drone return commands.
---
Do you not see the drone return command being initiated at second 7 of the video, or are you that retarded?
---
Your posting isn't helping anyone at all.
---
I mean if you complain that people go fishing in a barrel loaded with fish instead of the Sahara desert?
---
why is it that 50% of the tapi flairs post like this
---
i thought y'all were a reddit based alliance to being with yet you post like 12 year olds who just got on the internet
---
Has CCP considered offering some sort of in game incentive to use 2FA? I know you shouldn't need an incentive outside of your stuff not getting hacked, but it would seem like it would help improve the amount of people using 2FA and thus lessen the amount of accounts getting hacked, thus lessening the workload of the awesome people who try to get people their stuff back.
---
I'm not sure what kind of incentive you could really offer that would be fair though. For instance in SWTOR you get 100 of the "premium" currency per month you have 2FA activated but that is all used for cosmetic things. With AURUM being removed, I'm not sure how you could do that in EvE, unless we are all ok with giving a small amount of plex per month. AURUM would have worked better, that way it's only for cosmetic things that you can THEN sell for isk, instead of basically giving people free isk every month for using 2FA.
---
Just an idea, would love input and such
---
Found the domi pilot.
---
Fair enough. Best of luck
---
Dude.  The Tacos tho
---
At least he only looks like one. You, OP, are one.
---
Is this pasta or am I misunderstanding
---
Are you?
---
what the CSM has lacked for a while is someone with a fresh perspective. Newer players who aren't yet poisoned by the bitter vet goggles might actually solve some issues. God knows the bitter vets haven't. 
---
Selling to them is letting them outsource their manufacturing to you :)
---
Of course, as with all things, moderation. But you don't want to be shot with yout own ammo, do you?
---
the literal truckloads of salt from goons tell a whole different story, keep spinning...
---
Is this a reference I'm supposed to know?
---
You are probably a nice person but this toxic post doesn't help you at all
---
that's the exact opposite of what the CSM needs. the csm has turned into a popularity politics position instead of being an advisory position for players with actual experience to share that experience with the devs 
---
i'd gladly vote for cornak cause i have some faith he knows a bit about the game but not some dude who's platform says "idk u tell me" for null and wormholes
---
See, this is why I appreciate you more and more each day. You're a gift to us all.
---
This is what, the tenth time a goon has posted this exact same whine? 
---
Is this ten different goons with identical points of view, or one single goon input broadcasting on reddit?
---
I got a proposal too...You're a CSM right?
---
How about in your "privileged premium player who gets heard by CCP" position you talk/cajole/pressure CCP into delivering some actual features that have been "player ideas" for years instead of sitting there drooling or whatever you do while they outline their own stupid ideas (cowering behind the NDA) like the gambling lootbox mechanics of Guardian Gala... or the New-New-New-New-New Player experience?
---
Store fronts and internal markets (as in a market tab just for corp/alliance) were requested 12+ YEARS ago. Your modest proposal pretty much outlines that idea plus a "better corp roles" idea  that was wanted/suggested AGES ago - yet you (the CSM part of you anyway) fail to ever get anything done about getting those ideas in the game.
---
Before I get down-voted to infinity - Just to clarify this is not a personal attack (I quite like your fuzzwork site), rather an attack on your CSM role. I have boycotted the CSM from inception as I believe it was a PR stunt and has enabled CCP to dismiss every idea/request unless it comes through their approved NDA 'owned' CSM, causing inflexibility and in effect lobbying of CCP by impartial player groups.
---
You're right, I haven't seen any of those yet. That is quite interesting but not interesting enough for me to bother with the event. I guess the fact that I have better things to do in the game than mess around with the event speaks more to how much I'm enjoying playing EvE at the moment than it does to whether the event is any good. It just didn't grab me like some of the others have but perhaps that's just because I'm having fun messing around in wormholes and faction warfare.
---
Dont be AFK.
---
Super tank everything.
---
Dont fly alone.
---
Have scouts.
---
Have web alts. 
---
Dont be AFK
---
Thing is, its super easy to give out all fake info even if they ask.
---
If there is no gameplay related advantage to holding that chat channel then they can simply make a new one to use.
---
Is there a tool where you can enter reinforcement timers to automatically determine the time/date it ends?
---
Yeah, just join the mining fleet and your local friendly Rorqual will activate its panic modules on you if you face any trouble.
---
This is the kind of miner logic that gankers depend upon. Miners are not the most perceptive bunch and also tend to go AFK a lot. That's when you get hit and lose a Mack or Hulk and implants.
---
The best thing to do is always use a well-tanked Skiff or Proc to make yourself a less attractive target.  Sure it won't save you if they're dead-set on getting you, but it will increase the effort and expense. Dock up if you see a bunch of flashies in Local. The low-hanging fruit always gets plucked first, so tank up and let them pluck the others.
---
This is all part of following [the Code](http://www.minerbumping.com/p/the-code.html) that the gankers preach. For better results buy a permit to show your support for these principles. For the best results, forget highsec mining and go somewhere where the ore is worth your time.
---
Didnt say anything of the sort. 
---
Wtf? They were one of the best Russian groups left and probably the only one that had much of a real reputation.
---
It's like WH mining value-wise, except you never run out of anoms to mine and you can see exactly who is in system with you.
---
Space is to small and condensed for nullsec to work this way. ^(oh people are going to hate this - but if you care read why)               
---
     
---
In current new eden you will be camped and dropped just from the beginning by anyone who can - but mostly by people that loves when the "pray" cannot shoot back - aka cries here about defensive umbrellas people created.        
---
To begin what you are saying you need first have group of players that :              
---
* play in the same TZ and are willing to operate together in terms of fleets.          
---
* at least 2 FC ... better more as without people that can call for fleet and lead it , you will just feeeeeeed and by this bleed members fast               
---
* people in your group that will not engage in 95% of the PVE stuff - those people will find you targets and also "cull" surroundings a bit - giving your PVE members ability to breathe            
---
* you need space ... and you will not get sov before you have all stuff above working and ready.             
---
Eve need to change a lot in order for stuff that you just pointed out to work.         
---
Basically it need to be decomposed a bit - current map is not reflecting current mechanics **and state of game we have**     
---
Just to give you some perspective, in eve terms i am not "rich" player but i have enough isk to do some small projects for me.        
---
My current goal is to fill up my capital ship stocks so i decided to build myself 15 faxes ... and 15 dreads - it is not that i lack any of them - but having a stockpile will never hurt.     
---
    
---
I can field 4 of those at a time , not much - but at the same time i have twice as much characters that can fly those ships on same accounts.            
---
Any small group trying to achieve stuff that you pointed out need to compete with people like me and there are alliances that 90% of people have similar capabilities.         
---
What need to change .... space .... it must be more accessible - especially all those deep regions - the more connections (or entry points if you like)  they get - the less space groups can control - and by this letting more player groups to exist.        
---
Imagine yourself this situation.       
---
You have a area consisting of 3 regions ...             
---
**Variation A**     
---
it have 2 entry points and in 1 region and 2 other regions are "behind" the first.         
---
Who ever controls the 1st region can control 3 regions just by safekeeping those entry points.  If someone try to get in to one of the deep regions somehow - you can even starve him by cutting off logistic routes.               
---
**Variation B**          
---
Each region have 2 entry points ... due to ranges, time needed for controlling - you cannot hold those 3 regions - as it is to exhausting and simply unpractical.        
---
You will take as much space as you can control - maybe not even full region but part of it that you can cover by ranges or gate connections.   There will be plenty space for other people.             
---
Have fun solving this out ;) 
---
I'll vote for both &lt;3
---
Can I see the data for these claims? 
---
Listen, he just really really needs the j-number
---
i guess most commentator here are professional trolls. yes its heavily p2w.
---
skillinjectors, plex,dual skillqueues...u got credit card?
---
and now all the people be like " skillpoints and bling ships doesnt make u a good pilot...yak yak yak..."
---
you guys can go eat my poop.
---
its only half the fun when u kill some  nub in his blingshit, when he reships 1 min later like 0 fucks given ( and even if u kill that tard 20 times in a row...wheres the fun in that, if he too dumb to put up a nice fight, its just killboardpadding...).
---
Or have 5 omega alts rorqual mining = well again a possible p2w situation , setting up 5 omegas can cost quite some RL money, if u start from scratch and dont have ingame ressources to turn 5 alphas into omega not to mention inject the skills for rorqs...
---
same goes for the hardware at home..you got shitlaptop..having hard times multiboxing?..go buy better PC ( u dont wanna know  how often some dumbtards throw that sentence at u ingame..like yeah gaming PCs grow on trees and are for free)...another instance of p2w....well an abstract one that is, but still...
---
its true money doesnt buy brains and gamingskills...but it makes stuff a hell lot of easier, esp in a game like eve.
---
theres no possible way to deny that.
---
and no keep the shit coming, esp. those guys who feel super offended about the truth
---
I'll add these to the website as soon as I get home. Thank u for your contribution to the movement 
---
I do have to ask, how long did that take to draw?  It's fantastic!
---
Wtf is this garbage...
---
Okay, but once again without the tools how do these alliance leaders know people are botting? Just make a guess? Let reddit decide via witch hunt? Do we just report ever single person in the alliance so CCP can sort thru them and clear them?
---
I've seen a few posts on reddit where people post "OMG THIS GUY BOTTING FOR SURE" and the evidence they provide is extremely weak.
---
So again, fuck a 400+ member community because of someone's personal vendetta only?
---
Only reason that concept is getting cheered on in here is because of the "Grrr Mar5hy" sentiment around here. 
---
Stealing money from BB, okay fine, that shit happens in Eve all the time, but holding a chat channel hostage isn't even meta-gaming, like I said.
---
Everyone here is acting like CCP won't be returning the BB channel to the group and not Cow. If you're so sure...put your money where your mouth is, eh? Otherwise, all I hear from you is "Mar5hy bad, Cow good".
---
The link exists but the actual flash object wasn't archived by wayback, it doesn't load :( If you can find it that would be awesome! I've tried contacting Judas Poitot 
---
people have legit complains about the current state of the game and fears about the future of it wich have been going mostly undressed such as: Balance, Performance, Botting and RMT (locking L3/L4 missions is fine and all, but a single vni can do 1.2 billion a day running forsaken hubs and it dont need no stinking missions for that) Local being broken, Bad Plex Prices (a sub is not 1.8b+), Terrible events w/ horrible rewards and spawnrates and so on and so forth, the list goes on, and every day it gets longer and longer    
---
its time to adress all of these issues in a very long and detailed blogpost and video  
---
happy players make paying players, lets make sure to keep us all happy and paying 
---
I sort of get the feeling that this guide was written with the absence of the current state of nulsec on Singularity.
---
There is very close to 0% chance of a new small group occupying sov nulsec for any meaningful duration (longer than the time it takes to reinforce and destroy any newly anchored stuctures).  
---
Temporarily setting-up shop in the territory of a dying entity is probably possible, but again not a recipe for longevity.
---
There is a slightly higher chance in NPC nulsec, where random structures can survive a bit longer, but then a meaningful existence is harder to have without agreements with existing residents, that really have no interest, nor any reason to, share 'their' space.
---
That means joining some already established group, that don't need this guide, and will have ample guides of their own.
---
That would put everybody who already owns a super in a great advantage. It would make catching up to already established entities that much more difficult. Probably not a good idea.
---
Cake day, enjoy it.
---
dang, that's the one I forgot,  "8. Rookie Friendly" with a gif of a toddler getting bopped in the head and falling over.  
---
fuck off
---
lol it's been like this forever.
---
He wasn't banned lul, he went on vacation
---
Delet yourself
---
&gt; the evidence they provide is extremely weak.
---
Why do you think it takes us so long to investigate some of these cases?
---
I appreciate your use of a biblical writing style for a couple lines in there.
---
Okay - I'm all ears. not trying to be combative - just trying to learn how to fit an explo ship :) What is more useful? Another array?

---
&gt; I'm originally a Gallente player back from the times when drones were complete shit, and unlike a lot of people on here and other places, I don't want to go back to those times.
---
Me too.
---
Yes, fuck the 400+ member community. That has how eve has always been. HTFU.  
---
No one wants to "put their money where their mouth is" because   
---
1. No one gives a flying fuck about betting with you.  
---
2. The retarded things CCP has done in the last number of years, no one believes they won't just do another retarded thing and take it from CowKiller.  
---
Next you'll be saying he is a terrorist "holding a chat channel HOSTAGE".
---
:commissar: this garbage. Or at least tell me who they‚Äôre trying to beat so I can join the other side. 
---
WTF ?!          
---
Jon NC, you will fit there. 
---
quality of life bad?  huh?  compared to who?   ffs i used to be in goon(Imperial Guardians),  it was like being forgotten.   actually enjoying Horde.
---
standards low?  not really. at least we got the numbers to do things.  and honestly quality of ships has improved greatly.
---
as for the loss of perimeter. alot of assuming we lost it.   last i checked we still had ALOT of citadels profiting.  not to mention we've expanded in nullsec to 2 regions plus 2 unofficial ones..  and we've had NO problems with SRP on strat ops.
---
"A blog post and a video" isn't going to cut it.
---
We're aware of the issues, and we've been talking to the CSM a lot about them this week too.
---
I'd rather our staff be working on design documentation to address the issues first, rather than blogging about them.
---
We'll have more information as soon as we can, but before that time comes there's a lot of work that needs to be done.
---
Of course!
---
PGL...you've been a baaaaad boy!

holding a chat hostage is pretty clearly meta-gaming given how upset you are over it and how effectively its loss will impair your operations

not that i'd bet against a gm reimbursing something that shouldn't be reimbursable given how often gank victims get teleported to a npc station, but still

---
love you guys !
---
Hey look a CCP member posted, instead of having a conversation  with a normal human being, let's fling all the issues they already know about and aren't the one responsible for fixing at them. Sounds great.
---
This story line has been a bit of a slow burn for a while, lots of bureaucracy and politics, but it looks like it's starting to pick up. I'm interested in where this is going. Seems to hint at higher empire/capsuleer tensions, and perhaps not every baseliner is on the side of the empires. Increased drifter activity, their connection to the triglavians and this rogue drone related virus that can affect implants. I hope this goes somewhere instead of just petering off for a couple years like CCP normally does.
---
die to death ingame
---
More gochujang pepper sauce on everything.
---
Just some mobile game ripping off a bunch of space themed stuff 
---
Killing communities is a normal part of Eve; just look at CCP.
---
For sure and this is entirely my point, given it takes CCP with access to all the back end data a long time to nail down bots, how is an alliance leader who is not an expert and has no access to back end data or other such tools supposed to accurately assess who is and isn't botting within their alliance?
---
When pl invaded provi bb was also paid to fight the provi block.
---
What 2019 CSM?
---
Don't mind me just drinking my afternoon coffee. Carry on.
---
Misinformation is a powerful thing.
---
Reports don't have to be 100% accurate, this is the whole point.
---
If you have reason to believe someone is botting, report them and we'll look into it.
---
If you suspect someone is botting and feel strongly enough about it, don't have them in your alliance or don't rent space to them.
---
It's not rocket surgery.
---
It‚Äôs great when people who don‚Äôt vote bitch about the folks they don‚Äôt vote for. I‚Äôm sure Steve is going to jump immediately on your concerns.

Real life militaries target communications as a high priority target, why should eve be any different with lines of communication in game?

Scourge. forced us to create a new doctrine specifically to fight their loki comp because they kept yeeting our rorqs. Well that's in the past now, o7.

Yes. Ask your corp leadership.

Tax does not matter for profits. If the tax was 100% buy orders and sell orders would be 100% apart but ppl will still take same % margins on top.

Here‚Äôs your downvote - jerk
---
Hey Falcon,
---
I don't usually get involved in the shitshow that is CCP-Player relations, but I do have some experience in the community handling side of things.
---
You are 100% correct in that a video and a blog post aren't going to cut it. Players tend to favor quantity over depth- a communicative team can honestly get away with a lot so long as the playerbase doesn't feel like they're screaming into the void.
---
I think the main issue (from a player perspective) is very much the... lack of responsiveness? Mind, if I worked for CCP I wouldn't want to interact with the ~~autism~~ playerbase on that level either, but I do feel like more regular communication, even if the quality suffered a bit, might help.
---
Just my two cents, you'd know better than I what resources you have.
---
TFW the isk you just made from emtpying a 59m sp character dwarfs a giant corprate theft. LOL.

next time I go AFK pvping I'll make sure to make myself a squad member. :D

Downside?  You'll probably only be able to understand 50% of what she types.  Seriously, her typing skills are like an epileptic baboon is getting tased with all 4 of its hands on the keyboard.
---
alright cool, while im at it, give people feedback on bot repots, heck give em rewards when they report someone who ends up getting stripped of assets and banned, a notification and a %cut of the isk/assets (in isk, plex or exclusive skins [ones that arent pn the market anymore for example]) would go a long way

Project discovery 2: Bot boogaloo

You cannot take and hold moderately good SOV in 2019. The costs and time spent on improving the SOV is just a huge drain on the ally wallet and sustaining a war where you go back and forth will get you nowhere. And when the big coalitions near you decide its time for you to go it will be all over in a few days as you just can't counter titans bashing your fort or just overwhelming subcap numbers.

And for those that say 'oh you guys didn't know how to setup diplomatic ties with your big neighbors' well, when I was in CENTI we were blue to almost everybody around us in ER and then Skillu went blue&gt;red overnight cuz they wanted 'content' and it was all over.
---
And the Rorqual miners in a small alliance is just a huge NO, you'll be dropped and dropped and dropped until they die lol
---
But it's always funny to see ppl that never did any small scale SOV warfare give advice on how a corp like this should be run and what they should do lol
---
Yes, except the alliance tournement hasn't "gone into the night". Typical reddit. Toxic.
---
Hahaha Mar5hy is going to implode and self destruct bombers bar because he‚Äôs been trolled into trying too hard- now he‚Äôs obsessed and will be his downfall.
---
Support ticket response has already been automated, to serve you better!
---
thank you
---
The alliance tournament has gone into the night and then got shot at by a man from Florida claiming that he was standing his ground.
---
honestly found that funny, not heard some one say wuss in years...
---
when you get 0 feedback from CCP on these issues in the bazillion posts made about it, you take a chance when you see it 
---
Not really practical, unless you want wallets to go negative.
---
Would need to allow for a 'hold' on earnings, which wouldn't be popular (nor practical for new-players).
---
I wouldn't call that a giant corporate theft at all
---
its J-0118 999 881 999 119 7253
---
A negative wallet actually makes it extremely hard to sell the titan. You can't put it on market or on contracts. Additionally scaling this up to an alliance level is even worse, could lose trillions of isk for no wrong doing of their own. 
---
It's an interesting question. If we view commerce as a form of conflict, then the approach to inter-alliance commerce you suggest (broadly speaking - "don't do it") acknowledges that your neighbors and rivals are *better* at commerce than you are. Looking at a new group, in many cases this will be correct. You won't have backup systems already in place in case your external supplier sends typhoons where the haulers used to be. You're vulnerable to a rival taking what is effectively a loss leader by buying up all your stuff and then attacking you with it. If you can solve those issues, though, then you probably can win at inter-alliance commerce even as a new group. There are plenty of alliances out there without a strong PVE backbone. Letting them outsource manufacturing to you has the potential to be very lucrative.
---
Is he wrong in anything at all though? That should be the main concern for you to think about. You are our representative afterall, if someone realy believes it especially in your case in the first place. 
---
Yeah I get it.  I guess there's a lot of luck in finding these types too.
---
if they're just pretending to be retarded, that means you got trolled xd
---
Story? AAR?
---
thanks yonis very cool
---
The problem is the contradiction. You are saying alliance leaders don't have to police their members but also saying that if they don't they could face consequences. 
---
Wasn't it nearly 2 bil and with a lot of extra incentives, including plex?

What's wrong with player activities impacting the game's economy?
---
That's a seriously shitty idea, this game is supposed to be a sandbox ffs.
---
.5 and up if you're mildly tanked you're usually good and gankers will pass you over. 
---
perfect!
---
Jesus Christ Falcon. Why aren't you lead developer. 
---
thats actually fuckin great sumup xD
---
? My point is its difficult to balance officer/faction module drops in events because it impacts the economy. Unique items don't have that effect. Also, I'm not saying completely eliminate nice module drops, just use unique stuff as an additional incentive.
---
No, I'm saying we'll take away the shit that they get from illicit activity.
---
That's not consequences, that's fairness.
---
Steve, I love your work on applications, APIs, and database stuff but you are really out of touch here. 
---
Everyone is upset that trickle down economics isn‚Äôt working for the first time ever
---
Decent write up.  Probably works better if you are starting at stage 3, e.g. you already have a small group in an alliance that can provide cover for you, but you want to expand to a new area and are recruiting new players.
---
I thought discord only let you have 50 emotes?
---
&gt; feedback on bot repots
---
Something I'd love to see.
---
&gt; %cut of the isk/assets (in isk, plex or exclusive skins [ones that arent pn the market anymore for example]) would go a long way
---
Rewards would be interesting, but it would be pretty dumb to give them a cut of something that's polluting the economy and shouldn't be there.
---
This post makes me think you kiss girls too tbh

I'd have to check for exact timings, but I suspect you will actually lose time by refitting relative to just having a relic analyzer in all the time. Remember that there is a stacking penalty for each type of array, so I would be inclined to run MWD + Analyzer + 1 of each type of array.
---
Nobody's going to catch you without a very good decloak sphere or a bubble. For the former, a burst jammer doesn't help. (You're still uncloaked and in a bubble.) Your best defense is to book it with the MWD and cloak up immediately. A burst jammer *might* help you against a decloak sphere. I've honestly never had trouble with one of those in a prober. You don't want to be taking highly populated pipes anyway, so just go around.
---
If you do refit, you definitely want the second Rangefinding array. It'll help you exclude the types of sites you don't want to finish scanning down faster, and with your skills you should already be able to to 2 or maybe even 3 step drops reliably on a single Pinpointing array.
---
I forgot how crazy the conversations got in the forums.  Or maybe I erased them out of my memories. Lordy.
---
I am not a wormholer, learn how to close them, he who can destroy a thing controls a thing .
---
I want geckos again.
---
There's 3-4 systems of these, all created on the same day. And they all warp literally as soon as someone enters local, fast enough that an inty warping to the correct site won't catch them. 
---
He‚Äôs only a year in....... give it time
---
The thing that draws me to Eve is the lack of actual children. The leadning curve is a little too steep, so you don't have literal kids running around. Instead it's just a bunch of adults acting like kids.
---
Whenever I feel unfortunate, I remember there are people doing captchas for a living.
---
It's for making more people interested.
---
Input broadcasting means you have software that can repeat a command to multiple clients at the same time. Imagine having one master client and then a dozen subclients tiled in mini windows beside it, and everything you do in the master client is mirrored by the rest.  
---
Input broadcasting vastly increased the power of multiboxing. Imagine a farm of Rorquals that can all recall their drones, PANIC, and cyno simultaneously, or a fleet of gank alts that can all start shooting the same target at the same time. Before it was outlawed, a single competent multiboxer could even run Incursion sites entirely on his own. It allowed the power of single player to scale linearly with the number of clients rather than scaling logarithmically with his ability to manage them.
---
It was OP, so the rules were changed to forbid the broadcasting but retain multiboxing as long as the controller interacts directly with only a single client at a time.
---
What's wrong with killing some MTUs?
---
&gt; Elitist Recruiting =&gt; players with the necessary skills (to fly capitals) Mass recruiting =&gt; We will get by somehow (3 years till everyone can fly capitals)  
---
&gt;So, yeah, it's been accelerated, but it was the natural progression, if you ask me.
---
What's natural about it? We have lost one play style and are stuck with just the other.
---
&gt;The whole point of this little exercise is that you can't eliviate the numbers advantage for just one miniority (i.e. small gangs) without touching everyone equally. All the advantages that are not on by default (i.e. every advantage but local)are N+1 advantages.  
---
&gt;And no, ideally it's not that easy for a krab to avoid the hunter. Ideally, we would have a fight but that's not realistic without a fundamental overhaul of PvE. You can't put someone at a disadvantage (current PvE) and then remove the one counter he naturally has.  
---
&gt;It makes it a binary thing, which I agree is bad, but it's the way it is. Either you have eazy free kills because you only need to tackle the krab and then you kill him with your gang, or he escapes. It's not pretty, but it's what we have right now.
---
I would say the number's advantage favors the defender. You go to Delve...you aren't outnumbering anyone. Agreed that the divide between pve and pvp ships should be modified.
---
&gt; The assumption comes from the statistics - player numbers and the MER, which say that the average player numbers recovered from their freefall and have been consistent ever since the rorqual changes were made. Also, more destruction and more production. 
---
This ignores the fact that SRP always covered people's losses particularly Goons.
---
&gt;I can remember times where gridloading took so long that by the time you've loaded the grid after a jump, you were toast and back home already. I prefer tidi a lot over that.  
---
&gt;But yes, TidI is exhausting. Nevertheless, Tidifights usually have an impact on New Eden. You don't have that with small brawls. Big Fights often cause significantly bigger waves and that's what I like about them.
---
Yeah tidi is better than what we had before. But big fleet fights generally suck anyway. Small brawls don't have the impact that big fights do...but maybe they should? The initial wave of aegis sov with no citadels had some of that.
---
&gt; I agree that burning down citadels isn't the most exciting thing to do in Eve. It's possible though and if you want to stop krabs, you do have the option to do that. Without a place to hide, how many krabs do you think will continue to rat? :) 
---
Need to find a balance where there aren't citadels everywhere, wealth is more scarce, and there is fun play and counter-play to the whole small gang thing.
---
&gt;I agree - the viability is the problem, that's what I'm trying to say all along really. The problem isn't that you don't have the options, it's that they are sometimes barely viable.  
---
&gt;However, I don't agree that "It needs to be able to be done by 3 people in their dessis" and I certainly don't agree with you that blobbing is not viable.
---
Well then the viability is what needs to be discussed.
---
&gt;And I would agree - Citadel Spam is disgusting but they are content drivers to some degree too. Not easy to tackle as the current system is pretty reasonable for what it should achieve (i.e. it meets the goals CCP has set). So for me, the question is how they could be changed to make them more engaging and a more meaningful thing, but I don't know how that could be achieved. Pretty much every advantage they offer has a reason to exist by CCP norms...  
---
&gt;One of the big changes I would do right of the bat is asset safety. Move all the inactive assets to an NPC station in low and then remove asset safety from 0.0. I think that would go a long way in making them more attractive as targets.
---
I could see "mixed asset safety" in 0.0. Basically half your shit blows up with the citadel to be looted, the other half gets put in safety. Because you know most of 0.0 will not sign up to basically have wormhole rules. The other thing is making it so citadels don't have offensive capabilities until their first timer. So if you RF a citadel it can't shoot back. This allows small gang groups to actually stay on grid with a citadel if it isn't RFed and play with the locals.
---
&gt; Yes ofc a skilled pilot can balance out a wealth gap to some degree, that's not up for debate - it's the case. However, the wealth gap is way too large for that at the moment. Since creating wealth in null has done, what I would say, good things to the game (again, MER/Playercount), I would argue to give everyone outside of null a similar wealth so they can, once again, compete with the nullblocks. 
---
Not so convinced it's done something good. Wealth is too easy to acquire making engagements less meaningful/impactful. Activity via the MER/ship deaths does not necessarily mean a causational effect.
---
How is an alliance to know is the problem, that's where the vagueness of the issue. At alliance level I have no tools available to me to determine if we are renting to botters or not. The implication is that an alliance would lose isk they can't know the source of seems like it is not something that should be their issue.
---
It's the issue I expressed further below scaled up. If I sold a Titan to a botter and then CCP takes my isk what am I to do in that circumstance? Even if I get the titan back and lose the isk I am likely to be negative and in a difficult position to sell it. Similarly if an alliance loses hundreds of billions of isk for something they can't police this could cripple or destroy that alliance through no fault of their own. 
---
lies, it translates to cyka.
---
How about market bots?
---
I recently discovered while mining in a 0.5 a handful of gates from Amarr, that there are market bots doing endless loops around trade hub systems, in alpha ships, trying to look 'normal' and 'active'.
---
The locals told me not to bother reporting the bots, as they've tried, and they are just quickly replaced if they ever to get banned.
---
The particular system I was in (forget name, may have a bookmark still, but not sure), had at least 6 of these market bots constantly passing-through.
---
Surely such simple bots can be easily detected.
---
AAR(I'm crucifier):  tackled him on gate, established orbit, killing him, killed his one drone. He could have deaggressed but didn't. I bait tanked into 1/3 hull to keep him interested. He started to defang but too late. Then he died.. and a friendly Nereus warped in and took the loot.
---
Posted in separate comment
---
The problem is that we are not at liberty to put out every thing we say and suggest to CCP. So the assumption becomes that we haven‚Äôt brought the issues up at all, which is usually not true. 
---
So when somebody tells us we should do things that we‚Äôve already done and in the same breath says he doesn‚Äôt vote and thinks the whole thing is a PR stunt, well...yeah.

it does, that why there is an "emoji hub" server with categories and links to other servers, so you join the hub, see which emojis you want then by looking at the different channels then joining the corresponding server which is linked in the info channels, which would give you access to those 50 emojis

They only get called out because BB loves to claim total neutrality as part of its pitch.  If they were up front about being on contract against a particular group they'd probably still get just as many fleet members and then we wouldn't shit on them for being dishonest.

---
I get the bravado here with the whole ‚Äúdelve is safe‚Äù but the cloaky camping does have a negative affect on game play otherwise the ones you guys are doing in horde space by your own assertion now is useless?
---
Point is if the cloaky camping is legit then fair play but he isn‚Äôt so it‚Äôs unfair play .. these tactics do however cause a range of negative effects names it modifys peoples in game experiences.
---
I'd say that depends when in the game it is. Early on - I'd try to kill the Black Lotus because in theory it would be three more turns before he can drop the equivalent amount of lands/mana.
---
Later in the game, sure, I wouldn't care as much about the BL and counterspell the main spell that required said mana.
---
However, getting back to EVE, my overall point is that spending a lot of money on a game (EVE or MTG) doesn't automatically give you the skills to be competitive in the game. Having expensive items to use doesn't mean they can't just as easily be blown up by something that doesn't cost a lot of money.

---
Word on the street was that he got a 7 day ban. However I noticed during that 7 day window he still had Dons logged in, so tbh not sure there is any window in the timeline where the ban was enforced. 
---
This could be a case of a partner in the cloaky camping using same names and these accounts which were logged in aren‚Äôt technically his or it could have been him knowing that 2 analysts in CCP + handful of GMs would notice him logged in regardless of the ban.
---
Either way it‚Äôs a shit show on all fronts. Imho he should have gotten a 6 month ban given the level of damage he has caused to the game at such scale .. 
---
This is what i use

    [Helios, Nano Helios]

    Nanofiber Internal Structure II
---
    5MN Cold-Gas Enduring Microwarpdrive

---
    Scan Pinpointing Array I
---
    Cargo Scanner II
---
    Covert Ops Cloaking Device II
---
    Sisters Core Probe Launcher, Sisters Core Scanner Probe
---
    Small Memetic Algorithm Bank II
---
    Small Hyperspatial Velocity Optimizer II
---
Very first thing to keep in mind about a jammer or ECM drone of any kind is that the Helios isn't as hardy as an Astero. By the time a target has you locked up you already fucked up and are gonna die because basically anything is gonna alpha you. This fit intends to use it's speed and agility to evade being blown up, just watch dscan and don't spend longer decloaked than you absolutely have to.
---
If you are going to fo for a Zeugma or 'Frostline' Integrated Analyzer definitely also get a black glass neural lace. The massively improved hacking speed will save your life in this fit.  Also highly recommend a pinpointing implant. 
---
The lower the scan deviation you have the faster you will be able to scan signatures because you can get pretty easily to a point where you can drop the scan range by 2 ticks per scan and if you get it high enough 3 ticks per scan which makes it way faster. The most difficult to scan site as far as i know is the Superior Sleeper Cache requiring 107 scan strength, which you aren't running in a Helios anyway. Also don't be lazy like me and train Astrometric Pinpointing to V and get a Scan Pin Pinpointing Array II asap.
---
If you want something able to fight back or survive being tackled then you should look into the Astero. Your best bet in the Helios is to always run away if you smell danger. This fit is also not what i would reccomend if you are literally just starting scanning/hacking. If you want something cheaper/newer to the profession friendly drop a Pinpointing Array and the Zeugma for a Relic and Data Analyzer II and the rigs for a Memetic Algorithm Bank I and Emission Scope Sharpener I.

There is a longer list, but that would require more effort than CCP puts into making their coffee. I really hate these white knights. I would kill them (politically) but I biomassed 8 months ago, this only the stuff I read off of Reddit. I guess its close enough eh?
---
This has got to be the most subtle post StainGuy uas ever made on the topic of region accessibility. 
---
&gt; as I believe it was a PR stunt and has enabled CCP to dismiss every idea/request unless it comes through their approved NDA 'owned' CSM
---
I can tell you for a fact that you're straight up fucking wrong about that. From personal experience.
---
&gt;Is he wrong in anything at all though?
---
He is absolutely wrong about CCP only taking ideas from the CSM.
---
It is indeed reasonable advice to stay away from people breaching the eula because you can become collateral damage. But I feel like you‚Äôre crossing the line if you require alliances to start punishing suspected botters on their own.  It should be enough to right click report bot and you at ccp handle the case with an appropriate response. Punishing alliance leaders directly involved in botting activities or rmt is much needed, giving recommendations on good practice is great but actually threatening people that play the game that they will get punished by ccp because they don‚Äôt go crazy with the boot hammer and lynch other players whenever some random mails them that he thinks some renter uses a bot is not a good way of improving the game. These alliance leaders are the ones providing content to their members and they already have enough things to think about, fighting botters doesn‚Äôt have to be their priority.
---
oooh man, i know how these rewrites turn out from my day work
---
there's gonna be *plenty* of 'anti bot features' for the first couple of months :v:

I didn't even realize it was StainGuy until you pointed it out.

No no no! They should be selling their children to high seccers to eat.

so you've brought up all these things and they've been ignored in favor of, presumably, worse suggestions

the presumption is because of there were better suggestions, you'd have indicated as such

I'm sorry it's not your fault your job isn't getting done, but you're the one who has the job :-(
---
I thought exactly that on my session last night. I connected to Horde‚Äôs mumble server and it‚Äôs just a bunch of grown ups talking about space ships.
---
I hated to use comms with random people when I player other games like Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive because I was usually the older one in the match, I was worrying that my daughter might wake up in the middle of a session and they were discussing their homework from school.
---
We all were kids and teenagers once, but having older people to play with means much more profound and meaningful connections can be made.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs not giant. See Bad Bobby for giant
---
Not something I'd do. At least not deliberately.
---
Single supplier ecosystems are a risk though.
---
What are you asking? The dude's talking about about AWS (of which only a tiny and very recent part of the service has been on namely ESI and the new chat system) and "on prem" (colocation is not on premises). It's just demonstrating he's done zero research.
---
I know CCP uses AWS managed Kubernetes for ESI so its somewhere between $120 for the control plane and infinity, somewhere between $5 and infinity for the chat system, and somewhere between a lot of money and infinity for the colocation of TQ. Anyone claiming to know more than that without constantly reiterating that its a guesstimate is just lying.
---
May I recall your attention to the recent summer kerfuffle in Pure Blind, when Goons were cheerfully selling marked-up HACs to GoTG?
---
Ultimately, wars in EVE are **not** won by having ISK or resources. They're won, or rather lost, when one side loses the collective will to continue undocking effective fleets and confidence in the group leadership decreases to the point where individuals perceive that their future interest lies in looking after themselves as individuals rather than gaining benefit by supporting the group. Having fought in easily a dozen major conflicts, I cant recall a single one which was ended by the poverty of one 1 side vs the opposition - players will generally bail from the 'losing' side long before they've expended even a significant fraction of their NAV.
---
This is why posting on forums during wars gets so intense and aggressive: the enemy's morale is *always* primary.
---
no more like a  maruader  or something with specialised modules for blabbing ungodly amounts of fighters 
---
Doing gods work. Mad respect dude.
---
If you want to make that point then clarify it to say "unknowingly" harbour botters. The distinction is important otherwise basically every Null Alliance would be a culprit.
---
Can't see the amount on moblie 
---
&gt; You provide them hisec level protection
---
to be clear, Delve is way safer than highsec. 
---
Highsec protection - Concord - exists to punish, not to protect. They will punish the people who kill you, but they won't save your boat. 
---
Theta standing - FAX Online - *does* protect. Your boat will survive if you can get fax on grid. They'll also kill the people who tried to kill you. It's a much better deal.

TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
---
Yes 1600 with 5 task per minute and 300 per login. So they are aware that it is happening.
---
I was actually thinking about it too. Part of the reason that the current event and Permafrost are such shit is because CCP wants to reduce the accelerators coming into the game, but they obviously went way overboard on this to the point where now its super shitty.
---
So I was thinking, instead of reducing the rate of accelerators per event, why not just keep their high rate but make accelerator events like every 2 or 3 events instead, and give out other event rewards instead. 
---
I think it would keep a lot of people happier, or at least not as pissed off as they are now. A lot of players have cancelled subs etc. over this whole mess and even more are so pissed off that they are pretty close to it.
---
If you give them the old style of events at least once in a while, along with an explanation of why its done, then that would calm things down significantly. Sure there would be bitching and moaning, but no where near as many cancellations and turning players away from the game in general.
---
So unique item rewards might be a good way to do it, am not really sure what form these should take, but they do need to replace accelerators in value (current accelerator prices excluded cuz of price bloating due to event fuck up).
---
Zarms are fantastic.

Thanks man, much appreciated. Sad Panda Corp is expanding it's anti botting services in Omist and Branch now and we are always accepting donations to help spread the good word :) 
---
So you are saying that whether you CSM folks actually do something or not stays hidden from us (as results are not visible (yet?) or "in the process of whatever" therefor under NDA) and we should just take your word as a proof? I have my serious doubts about CSM in general, but its not CSM's fault. I simply have no faith left in any communication from CCP's side with anybody who has anything to do with anything at all, CSM included. Thats the reason i feel like the CSM in pointless and simple wasting of eachothers time. It all started back when Logibro and Manifest were "left" out of CCP. I am voting every year, but frankly just for lulz as i dont give a jackshit whos sitting there doin nothing v0v

Join a WH corp :) one that actively does stuff. Not one of the big boys like NOVAC or LZHKs (nothing against them, they're great - but I think it's a better experience when you first go into w-space to be with a smaller group that's tight-knit and super active). I'd recommend NaturalPhenomenon (NAPHE), sleeper dreams, Opsec., Sinnners trajectory, stranger danger, or wormhole society. Forgive me if I've forgotten a couple, I'm sure others will highlight a few...

---
Yes they are.
---
Wormholers seem to be the only ones to adapt them to their fleets. The zarm I fly has saved at least 4 primaries from exploding near structure through the ramp up mechanic.
---
It's really good in heavy armor. 72km optimal with a choice of smart bombs or anti-support guns is good.
---
My complaint is the killmarks on it are microscopic 
---
Dooo eet put that in and refresh / re upload. 
---
then go to zkill and find it? or do you need your fc to broadcast it for ya?
---
What happened with cowkiller
---
You being a whiny retard doesn't make eve p2w.
---
Not worth it. You can't get your own c6 rental anymore. 
---
I use mine as a meatshield. It absorbs the heat from the grill and becomes a tasty bacon
---
I named by ship Chris P. Bacon
---
Test also had the benefit of sheer numbers to make this kind of plan work. The often overlooked thing is that no small group can implement this without renting or becoming pets first. (Which is the primary problem at the moment.)
---
As if russian wasn't hard enough to read by itself. 
---
&gt; If they were up front about being on contract against a particular group
---
what makes you think they are in the first place? I mean I already know the probable answer but let's try the benefit of the doubt for once.
---
ECM was reworked not so long ago.  
---
Jammed ship keeps lock on the thing that is jamming it. That includes ecm drones and the barge that launched them.
---
hmm any idea why this was removed by a mod?
---
Cheesy items might be interesting, like a single use 8 sec 100% speed boost.
---
I don't want to shit on this too badly because you're a really chill dude and super nice when I met you in person, but it does read as someone who isn't in touch with the current state of things in 0.0. 
---
Couple of things that are very overlooked:
---
1.  You need friends or numbers... You mention "dropping a Keepstar is better." Who's going to defend it? A group like Snuff, SU or most other large alliances would love to kill an anchoring Keepstar they know can't be defended or was dropped by an inexperienced group.
---
2. No where does it mention PVP content. Whereas industrialist players would find this kind of empire-building fun, most players get bored relatively quickly. You'd need to be central enough to an area for content to make this feasible, unfortunately all of those areas now are in mega-coalition sphere's of influence. You either blue up the group near you or get forced out. 
---
3. Piggy backing off of 2, if you don't have PVPers entertained, they will leave. If they leave then the industrialists won't be safe to drop rorquals. If you can't save the Rorquals they'll join an alliance where they can. It's why groups like Goons/ TEST are able to pull such high numbers and the meme of 'Oh just get a rorqual into goons' is so ever-present in a lot of non-sov holding groups. (Even some groups that do own sov.)
---
Just out of curiosity... do you believe this play style is still relevant enough to stand by this post...? If so, is this something you argue for in the CSM.... It could speak volumes as why the game is in such a state if this is the style of game play you're advocating for the rest of us. 
---
Your lack of breathing gave you brain damage
---
Nope, I'll continue saying he's not metagaming by doing what he did, in anyway? He's not ransoming access back, he's not doing anything with the channel, or assuming the BB name with a different group, etc. 
---
It's not a corporation, apparently that's hard to understand in /r/Eve, it's a NPSI group that helps new players get a taste of combat. It's a community that's been in Eve for years. CCP will return the channel to the community because it's the right thing to do here, regardless of how "Grrr Mar5shy" everyone wants to be.
---
It was Flavor Aid
---
Everyone in this thread is buddmad
---
it would be nice if they reworked citadels to allow logi reps.
---
bit like...you know...POS.
---
Honestly, this was the best point you made in the post. The issue is most small groups can't safely produce without help from larger entities. Also, a lot of smaller 0.0 groups pull from local market-hubs of blues rather than go to Jita if they can help it and the prices are insanely marked up.
---
When is CCP going to denounce astra farming the drifters? It's about time we get rid of these risk averse krabholes and put more dreads on grid in w-space.
---
The thing is... these aren't suggestions. These are the game's most incredibly basic concepts of existing in Sov Null  to the point that even SMA already knows about them, and these points don't help a group (which at this point would require the capability to put 100 characters flown by veteran/solid pilots) to conquer more than an edge system in Etherium Reach, which holds literally no value whatsoever.
---
There is nothing here on the politics of where to settle, what you need to get there, or what you need to prevent that Fortizar from being deleted on anchor by a super blob.
---
In short... this post is useless. None of this would allow me to organize a group and get a chunk of (already claimed) Sov null for ourselves.
---
A microwarpdrive. You‚Äôll need that to get out of bubbles. If you jump into a camp, activate it right as you activate your cloak, and burn either right at the gate, or at a line perpendicular to the direction the campers are from you. 
---
If you‚Äôre in wormhole space you might want to keep the jammer, because there you can get tackled without making any mistakes, but in null you know exactly who is in local, if you see someone with explorer kills on their kB then you should just leave system. Add them as a contact with bad standing if you plan on going to the same place frequently, since it‚Äôll save you time on your next trip. 
---
Fair point. Still 20+ bill isn't chump change either.
---
That would definitely be a great use of a massed Zarmazd wing, although I'm not sure they'd be worth the considerable investment. Most people would probably decide to go with the T1 variant instead. 
---
Here‚Äôs the thing - no matter how many ideas I have, good or bad, the biggest thing we do is provide CCP with feedback on stuff they already are doing or want to do. Us bringing issues we want to see fixed is what most players think we do, but it‚Äôs not the primary reason CCP keeps us around. 
---
The amount of bad ideas we try to shoot down is far greater than the things we are able to get fixed or changed from our ideas or community ideas we present. And the entire point of the CSM from CCPs perspective is to have a group of players they can bounce ideas off of without those ideas being made public. That way they can try to innovate, present bad ideas or crazy ideas to see what folks think and the like. There is no way a company would do all their focus group stuff in public. 
---
What if you gave them a token (lore item) that included a note of how much ISK they removed and the involved capsuleers?
---
For example, Missive of Excellence: *This missive was sent by the authorities at CONCORD to assert the excellence of StainGuy in the chucking of poop at renowned botting ring Here_Be_Bots. Over one thousand isk was removed from involved parties, as well as a bot-mined shuttle empire. We are pleased to announce that EVE is better for the Stain.*
---
Okay y'all are better at writing the lore, but you get the idea. Congratulate a few players/alliances by name in the lore item; you could, if you wanted to, include an entry in the 'wheel of progression' (I have no clue what you called it) that you added.
---
You could even have escalations in the drone lands drop special 'records of legendary hunters' (the hunters who removed bot-infested capsuleer corps/alliances) &amp;ct.
---
Just my two cents; hope you're having a good one!
---
p.s. I hate lootboxes, first event I haven't logged in for in a while :(
---
&gt; but it would be pretty dumb to give them a cut of something that's polluting the economy and shouldn't be there.
---
wich is why i suggested "vintage" skins, id kill for a chance to get some more rataa sunset skins on my capitals, and to prevent people from selling em , make em a redeemable wich will instantly activate the skin licence on the character wich redeems it (like the SP gifts on the login events) 
---
Imagine spending 50b so you don't have to learn how to PvP in a subcap.
---
Would have certainly seen some use in AT...
---
IF WE HAD ONE
---
No, you can measure logged in users every 2-3 minutes and build up a profile of what each day looks like, then build from there. That's what Chribba does at eve-offline and what I do with a little app I built.
---
PCU is a single snapshot taken at around 1940 EVE time every day (the time logged in users peaks every day). It's not useful as a metric.
---
But it‚Äôs a net faucet. No insurance company could operate giving out more money than they take in.
---
oh btw.....the Plex market moved to New Caldari.....
---
so yeah,  revenue is fine.
---
oh boi the beans are getting on reddit!
---
I would side with Cowkiller. Because my interactions with him was always positive. Even when he dropped on me. the times the drop didn't go well (successfully defending myself) and they couldnt get anything Cowkiller has accepted my dual request me vs his fleet for some action before fleet stand down. The marshy dude....all i been hearing is just bad shit about him, cowkiller some bad some respect. 
---
Do what you gotta do Cowkiller.
---
I'm not sure I follow.
---
They gave channel owner permissions to him right? It's his now, he can do what he wants to.
---
Help me to understand.
---
CCPls seed infant BPOs
---
Mmmm no not really.
---
Loyalty is an admirable trait in a line member. There's something to be said for being satisfied with one's lot. üëç
---
There is no statistics for how many rorqual pilots or super pilots are available month by month.  This isnt a statistic.  But just by playing the game you can tell how fucking many there are.  You know what he is talking about, but you want concrete proof when you know that isn't possible.  So many have an actual debate with each other.
---
DOUBLE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH
---
not that i would advocate an innocent person being shot, but I can only imagine the tragedy that may ensue when they find out this person helps run an organization called "bombers bar"
---
Look for it in the next AT
---
You're looking at it from the wrong perspective.  It's a CovOps.  You live by not engaging.  Except for bubbles you have almost complete control on what you engage.  If you engage something you're dead so fitting items to deal with an engagement is a waste of a slot.
---
Fit something that you'll use regularly.
---
is it this time of the year again? 
---
ITT: pelijr is seriously concerned that his community is too unskilled to join a new chat channel.
---
For like the first 3 weeks, all he killed was a vni and an orca. 
---
every single time
---
Top comment is literally the worst comment.  With a fully inplanet Mid grade virtue pod you + 7th +8th slot scanning inplants you get a ridiculous bonus to scan strength and pinpointing.
---
Scan acquisition is the least bonused and has the most impact.  
---
If I were to pick one I‚Äôd go with acquisition.
---
GTFO nerd.
---
They don't have the numbers to be able to even do it. You think they will be able to inject into more rorquals then delve with less numbers and income while delve only ramps up. 
---
Big yikes
---
I run Pathfinders in Goonswarm...
---
HANDS UP DON'T SHOOT
---
THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN...and it is done!

That is legit. Although I only have 1 isk. What do fc?

gimmie fucking cat ears ccp
---
*All sides of the dice have the Goon fatbee on it*
---
  "OH LOOK DELVE AGAIN, WHAT ARE THE ODDS"
---
Id like a damage cap and ref timer on my archon too pls.
---
Yeah, the whole "Grrr Mar5hy" that "Everyone" has been saying. I've not said his name once in this thread (apart from quoting in this post just now), am I not part of "Everyone"? It's more like he keeps bringing them up all the time like some whiny little bitch because he can't get his own way.
---
Good to hear my dude and how it should be! HMU some time to kill dudes.
---
Remove the damage cap and sure that would be great
---
Fair enough. Do they have NPC Stations?
---
One has plenty of spare Reeeee to go around, the other doesn't.

Have you taken penicillin?

I'm deathly allergic, I cannot

I figured people going to null would already have the pvp side of things down. This is all additional stuff.
---
&gt; He became a part of the wallpaper after about 15 days
---
  Just like the regulars cloaky camping Eso today. Hi Kintzel!
---
Reading over the responses to this post have been kind of interesting. There seems to be a split between the "well duh" responses and the "this is all crap" responses.
---
Who are you?
---
Sov null never did. And then conquerable outposts were converted to faction Fortizars.
---
What about of you detect botters, go to that system with a fleet of real players and start farming it, the bots will stay docked and you'll have their wallets locked. Not to mention to set a trap in every exit, just in case the botter wants to move to another system.
---
But that takes time, and most of the real players are old and full of real life responsabilities besides EVE. So they won't bother, and will continue to complain as if the solution will fall out of the space.
---
You can sperg all you like, eve is more risk adverse then ever. Because more shit is blobed and dies has absolutly nothing to do with risk. Your  comment is dumb because you are using a stat to back up an a point that is isk killed, not risk.
---
2. You need to gain from pvp other the  the joy of combat and skill? Make sure you fit your salavager to i guess. 
---
ur flair is really hilarious
---
Using it as a weapon against someone? Do you mean goons n test like always? No one cares
---
Not quite. I just find the absolute statement that only 1 percent of the game could achieve a big shiny toy is stupid.
---
This is what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
‚ÄúRisk averse reeeee‚Äù
---
Who? Where? There‚Äôs a whole culture of just suiciding shit in highsec. They don‚Äôt do that shit for ‚Äúthe joy of combat and skill.‚Äù
---
There‚Äôs a bunch of people who camp gates in Lowsec still. Again, not for the ‚Äúthe joy of combat and skill.‚Äù
---
There‚Äôs tons of dudes who show up in non-Delve nullsec with roams and small gangs and even solo. Maybe they do it purely for ‚Äúthe joy of combat and skill‚Äù which definitely explains why most of those dudes fight VNIs and shit right? So much skill there that it makes the AT look like a bunch of krabs.
---
Take your sperg about being risk averse when people don‚Äôt feed to you and go play some call of duty or shit.
---
Not much. Abyssal Sites are neat. Their most recent event was trash with trash rewards of purple skins and eyeshadow... but as long as we don't see cat-girl ears and in-game waifu pillows, I think we will be okay
---
I don't know what they're doing right now.  I am referring to the Esoteria contract Mar5hy accepted from Noraus for 1b a system.  While constantly rolling for Eso holes and refusing to attack any other targets, Mar5hy kept claiming (on reddit, when he was trying to dodge his ban, and elsewhere) that BB was a neutral entity.  It clearly wasn't.
---
anyone can look at your zkill and see where they are taking you to hunt. Every once in a while they take a nice easy target next to the hole they rolled in some random region, the other 90% of the time its test or goon space.
---
They‚Äôre good peeps. 
---
You can only do this once every four hours without a sizable rep penalty.  Not an option, I'm afraid.
---
You know what helps with region accessibility?
---
A lowsec gate to stain.
---
This is the ultimate shitpost veiled in a coherent argument.
---
honestly, i'd love it if they did that. (and disable doomsday on citadels)
---
heck, could even add some dmg cap based on your sov in the system.
---
The impact is short lived tho and the events are spread out enough that any impact it does cause does not last, but honestly im not even sure it caused much of an impact anyway, id wager the bulk of the people taking part in the good events with nice loot would have probably been running 10/10's or farming anomalies anyway so the loot they missed from those sources was just replaced with the loot from the event.
---
I mean unless some one has actual metrics to look at its all assumption.
---
As for the events themselves, they nailed it early on and have progressively fucked it up with each subsequent event.
---
I'm not as cynical about it tho, I think the mining change to have ore in the combat sites was probably more about freeing up dev time by not having a separate site to design and test for miners, and the blue print for the boosters  could have simply been the devs trying to give industry a little nudge, clearly these changes have not sat well with the community, honestly I hated it as well id rather get a booster not a bpc and Id rather have a separate site for mining the ore if there is any rather than forcing me to pve then mine.
---
I don't see why during events they cant simply have some event ore spawn naturally in ore anomalies and then just stop them spawning when the event ends no need to design a mining event around it just let the miners shoot their rocks.
---
CCP getting more shit than usual gradually, but it's probably not on PA, just a coincidence.
---
Yes, I have the social skills, but they only improve gains - I need uninterrupted gains.
---
Declining missions against other factions can only be done once every four hours without a faction rep penalty, so it's not really a solution.
---
its not so much that we are complaining about them always fishing on our porch, but more about the fact that they claim to be neutral and don't always fish the same spot, when in fact they aren't neutral and they do fish the same areas every chance they get.
---
This very much so. One of the topics on talking in stations recently was the ‚Äúwealth of alliances‚Äù and basically all the big alliances have such large pockets that it‚Äôs almost impossible to make a noticable dent.
---
Who would downvoted this? :(
---
Yeah I'm not sure what they think a GM is going to do. Historically jacking someone's corp or channel or funds is ignored by GM's unless hacking or stealing a players account was involved to pull it off.
---
It does make you extremely powerful if you can drop the cash on fresh titans each time. P2W is not about being the most powerful, just buying power. Can you? Yes.
---
&gt;TO be fair centi diplo probably the worst diplo possible.
---
Elaborate? I'm actually curious
---
Anyways, Rarilmar does make a fairly good point. If a larger group wants to kick you out you're gone. Happened to us when we were in Tenerifis, happened after that in Etherium Reach. 
---
It is already a spreadsheet simulator :V
---
Here's a thought don't be fucking stupid with channel access if you don't want it getting stolen, this is EVE, if you leave the door unlocked long enough someone will steal all your shit.
---
Why would you go whaling in say oasa during USTZ or Cloud Ring ever when you can roll for Delve or Eso and get damn near guaranteed kills?
---
Like, i get the need to character assasinate some autistic nerd on a public forum, but lets not act like its some grand conspiracy lmao
---
You just stated the value of taking the channel.... disrupting a 400 man group, doesn't get much more meta than that. Good luck having CCP hand control back to marshy unless account theft or hacking was involved.
---
&gt;Nope, I'll continue saying he's not metagaming by doing what he did, in anyway
---
its so meta he's got you crying uncontrollably on reddit and petitioning devs to fix marshy's fuck up.
---
Awesome !!!!
---
this reads like it is written by someone who has never attempted to assault or control nullsec
---
because its an open secret he only camps when he's getting paid to do it.
---
Goons just killed the main Fortizar while those who forget their friends overnight cheered and kissed goon butt.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/75244979/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75244979/)
---
You really want to know the reason why GSF evicted Stellae but the exact truth maybe only those who orchestrated it know and the smaller(or even upper) goons know just the pretense that appeal to them. 
---
But if you want another suspect reason, check how many of the Goon leadership is part of the fail monkeys alliance who didn't have enough members (and still doesn't apparently).
---
Mean people :(  
---
OOOOooo out of my own curiosity, I would love to see those numbers as well once you get them. Are you going to post them ?
---
that would require effort and intelligence and marshy's brain is melting from all the time he has spent in delve.
---
By the time I learned that kissing boys was the correct decision... I was already married :(
---
Eh, I know enough about code to know it's a scam, even then I don't like them on principle and would never pay them, as a whole they have actually lost more isk to me than I have to them, but they aren't the organization ganking me anyways I just don't like them. So I am probably red to them, and I just dock up when they hit my system. 
---
It's the people who don't preach code and just show up for an easy target.

I know, that's why I had to qualify it with "forensic." This game is totally a regular accounting simulator.

hello, chief centipede caliphate(dot) diplomatic officer wildkins here

please lodge a complaint in the replies below, please and thank you

of course they do, but they need to collect evidence. that is much harder and takes a lot longer.
---
Feels like its been forever since the last Naz post what a great way to start the week.
---
Can/do you guys sell the plex you confiscate on the Jita market?
---
As the bots make isk and buy plex and then the plex is destroyed via bans it's stolen from the eve economy/players and contributes to pushing out real players who are obviously less efficient at making isk than bots...
---
Atleast there was an incubation period for training the toon
---
Nice! Thank you, you raise some good points. I will do that
---
Apparently doesn't know how to resolve basic discord permission set ups either.
---
Fair enough :-) I will lose the burst module. Thank you for being patient and explaining. 
---
That's why you do missions in systems like Torrinos where you have two level 4 security agents in the same station. It's an option, I'm afraid.
---
CCP should definitely add a skillbook with this skill
---
Will do - I've decided to lose the burst module
---
yup yup
---
Actually my beef is with CCP - they created the CSM.
---
The CSM by your own admission are just censored politicians responsible for crowd control. Like most politicians I'm sure most mean well, but there's also a bunch there for personal gain (such as the ego Gianturco and others hoping to land a job at CCP)  and a holiday (sorry 'working weekend experience' or whatever you prefer to call it).
---
Although I feel we'd be better off without the CSM, I bitch about a lack of implemented ideas here specifically related to Steve's post because CCP have failed to deliver on them and the CSM (whoever they happen to be that week) are complicit in that.

---
&gt;cuz they wanted 'content' and it was all over.
---
things f1 warriors believe
---
here's what actually happened. you were blue while we were both in the south attacking tapi, we had some good fleets, some good times. you had a fortizar under a cyno jammer in PEK. your dipshit ceo decided to leave for "content" and moved in next to literal renters and blues with no communication to either. the cyno jammer was lost, unhelped by the fact that centi was no longer present to run defensive entosis
---
once we were done in the south we came home, you were reset and removed
---
i wouldn't compliment you by calling it content, that's what tri was for about a week
---
there are a couple of places where there are agents all piled up in one station, and many more with several agents in a system. you can only decline once every four hours *per agent*, but you can decline a mission then just go start with a different agent
---
super useful when multiboxing hard as you have to click less modules and dont have to bother with cap chain. imo oneiros is very underwhelming. guard should be prefered for fleet stuff (not gang) of any size tho.
---
Eve is huge, there are many systems especially, but not only, deep in sov space where nobody will be even looking for a fight. You can join one of these alliances and look/ask around for where you can mine safely.
---
You can also go to NPC null and find some low traffic pocket systems that have low traffic but that's a bit riskier and requires you to dock up or take other measures (like putting inline bubbles) to protect yourself.
---
What do you mean gathering 70%+ of the pve players in the game in 2 regions only makes us a target for Bomber's Bar? That's not fair why isn't marshy going elsewhere
---

From one of the recent TiS episodes, it seems like most of them are joining Skill U. From my interpretation, the break up seemed to be due to a lack of people willing to do menial paperpushing work. 
---
Bear in mind that that line is only there because of the controversy a while back where Mittani told people not to report goons. It wasn't subject to any particular scrutiny with regards to messaging.
---
They pushed injectors before Koreans, but so far its only skins and crap.
---
Im sorry Welstiel but where is your proof that Ray scammed people? If you have it, by all means show it to me. All I have seen is accusations. No chat log, wallet screenshots showing payment etc. Just logs of you two fighting constantly because you two clearly dont get along.
---
As I have stated previously, being a member of his corp, I never noticed or had any reason to suspect Ray was scamming people other then some that had Chuts approval because spies or something.
---
And frankly, as a person who mined with him constantly, the botting accusations are false. I never once seen signs of him botting. Warping together, pulling drones at the same time etc. Just a guy who mines all the dang time because he works at home.
---
Im sure ill be accused of white knighting, but my from my observations as a member of his corp, and one who played with him on the regular, i have not seen or observed anything to suspect he was doing something nefarious.
---
I cant speak for the twitch aspect. I dont know twitch rules and have only managed to stop by his stream a few times.
---
Before specially skilled characters weren't available in bulk, you could find a dozen quickly sometimes for skilled up carrier alts but then the market would be dry for a while.

zkillboard.com
---
On level 5 skills, so Omega, if you take it easy, play chill, go take a piss, go get a drink etc. you make 40-60 mil / hr doing L4s. If you go ballistic on it and blitz or concentrate and just do clears for bounties + mission objective and do not care for loot, you can make around 70-100 mil / hr depending on market swings of off whatever LP you are getting. If you do burners instead of declining them, then add another 10-15 mil on top of that.
---
But doing nothing but blitzing or just concentrated runs like this is very unrealistic for any human being. It drives you fucking nuts after a longer while, so you slip back into the chill style, which lowers the averages of everything.
---
These numebrs are lower for Alphas. They do less DPS thus clear them slower, have less tank and far less utility, so they actually lose ships, unlike Omegas with level 5 skills. Maybe 20% ish or around there.
---
However, since we are talkign about bots, bots never have to slip back into the chill style, and they can operate 23.5 / 7, they can be rotated in shifts of X hours each not to trigger the 23.5/7 flags.
---
So my guesstimate, and mind you this is a guesstimate, is that its around 50-80 mil / hr per bot.
---
As far as mission puling goes, its irrelevant for L4s unless you go for pure burners and you can't do it on alphas because you need to be partied with your puller to get the mission and the reward. Pullers are used extensively for L5s because not all L5s are soloable and not in all ships, so you disgard the ones that don't fit the bill, no choice there.
---
if you know someone that is using alphas for pullers like this, then that person is already breaking EULA by having alpha and omega runnign at the same time, unless its on different machines, like alpha laptop, omega on PC.
---
I'm aware of at least one goon corp who paid him to camp their home system to spook other people away from the spod rocks.
---
you have to be in party to get the mission, to turn in rewards, to share the rewards.
---
that would require your leadership to be active in any capacity whatsoever
---
I don't know that many rorquals that would burn a panic on a subcap. 
---
Well you would take my 2 isk, then have 3 isk, then from there you repeat the action until you become a millionaire, then eventually win the game! \o/
---
In order of effort
---
P.I. is good in null, that can get some good money, depending on how often you log in. It‚Äôs like 20/30 mins to set up then a little time to haul the stuff around. Requires a couple weeks of skills, and a miasmos (gallente industrial)
---
Station trading is next. Requires a big initial investment, done on hisec alts.
---
VNI ratting. You kill rats in a navy cruiser. Havens pay the most, and you need to keep an eye on them, but you can run them mostly afk, ganking is an issue though.
---
Next is explo. My favorite, requires a 2mil ship and a week of skills, pays good in some places, meh in others. Very much an at-keyboard activity. Pays a lot more than vni rating in Sansha space, which is where I live.
---
Then it‚Äôs escalations. Again, depends on location. For Sansha space it‚Äôs a matter of getting a 1bil smartbomber and a 200 mil -2 bil ship to run the site. I have done Sansha 6/10s, which are done in like 30 mins and can drop a 1 bil module, so it‚Äôs like 500mil/hour if You solely do the sites. Waiting for the escalations bring that down a lot.
---
Generally they are doe eyed and the pvp is an afterthought. Any competent pvp group wouldn‚Äôt need a guide for the alliance building side of things.
---
That's a bug caused by resetting the server outside of downtime.
---
It would really give dreads one of their own roles back, it would be great.
---
But Mar5hy
---
With the ASiC Miners
---
In Local
---
this is literally the most ive seen ccp converse with the community in 6 months.
---
I was very unlucky then, because out of 6 fleets none of the 6 sides of the dice turned on one of the 6 Tapirium ones.
---
Exactly my issue - The CSM were sold to the community as being representatives of the community empowered to help CCP implement community ideas and requests (amongst other things). 
---
In reality the CSM are a closed focus group with little to no power - and gagged from even telling the player base when CCP said their ideas are shit or that they'd rather spend their money developing ways to further monetise the game than waste money on the stuff the players actually want.
---
If you have to gimp your mining yield to get more tank then it's just better to use the skiff/procurer.
---
Hot Naglfars want to meet in your area. Click now!
---
They have years of server logs. Checking active game time would catch a ton. This would take about 30 secs. They could start by checking all toons that are part of botswarm.
---
Bcs reason and how time zones work cannot be explained to Tapurium downvote brigade retards.
---
Unless they run a locator agent on you
---
Haha, thanks, hope you had the time to read some of the stuff I put there.
---
very nice piloting!
---
Not really, as far as im aware the skill injectors are not giving any SP into the game just redistributing it. 
---
Why would you do that ? They are solved, sure, but 1 slip up and you're a gonner. Its not risk free activity like super ratting, not even close. Also, makes perfect sense to have them especially in NPC null.
---
loot boxes and them being a lot more petty than usual in the name of profit (garbage event with 90m +6 accelerators, sky high plex prices and garbage -10% "sale", cancelling at cause they fired all the nerds who did it for free and don't want to spend a penny on it). as far as p2w goes, that's pretty difficult to achieve unless they mess with core pvp mechanics. so probably just a matter of time.

---
Can somebody tell us what actually happened between CowKiller and Mar5hy? 
---
If LP goes up high enough I might go back to do some missions, hehe. Also, L3s are unprofitable now, but if the LP values go up high enough ... hmmmm ... then there wouldn't be a point of excluding alphas from L4s .....
---
I guess Bombers Bar with all the drama that's happening with them, will be overthrown by Drifters Bar with Drifter hotdrops on rorquals and stuff. Sponsored by CCPlease.
---
Also, if you must mine in highsec 0.6 do these two things.
---
A. Check killboard for miner ganking activity in the system you intend to mine in.
---
B. Look for highsec "island" systems which require going through lowsec to get to, they tend to be more off the beaten path.
---
HA!
---
&gt; I figured people going to null would already have the pvp side of things down.
---
Ah, I think that's where you went off track. Plenty of new groups have gone to nullsec with no clue how to PVP. In some sense it's even helpful IMO -- "we suck because we don't know what we're doing, but we'll get better next time" is one of the possible ways people can endure a string of heavy losses. Endurance to losses is a key factor in nullsec war.
---
Most of the examples of groups who were already PVP experts before nullsec are either so old that they date back to the days when everyone was noobs, or were formed from retreads of previous alliances breaking up.
---
CVA has been in providence for more than a decade and they *still* don't know how to pvp.
---
Its just too impractical. Same reason that no one but bots moved into dronelands. For stuff like this to happen it needs to be close by and easily accessible location. The ones that aren't in drone lands often set up deep or behind, or as deep or as far behind as they can, of one or another alliance defence perimeters, making it too difficult to get to them.
---
Sure doing it a few times is OK, but if you need it done all the time its a whole different animal, just not worth it due to it being major PITA.
---
What a faggot, so you play this gay shit and buy and sell video game accounts?  Kill yourself faggot socialst bitch
---
better remove any scripts you got and maybe even that ISBoxer too.
---
aar?
---
HAHA

YA I USE eveoffline

Selling a titan with a Negative wallet, is likely a pain but use an alt to sell it it's a titan your gonna have a cyno alt.  
---
The issue is that this isk shouldn't exist in the first place, because it was generated via exploiting the game, keeping this isk around rewards alliances for turning a blind eye to botters (via tax revenue). 
---
If it means they can be hit with a massive bill it means turning a blind eye is no longer optimal. 
---
The winning move for alliances is to do as little as possible to detect bots and preferably hint to bot owners that their space is great for them.
---
Who doesn't do that?
---
Join a Null-sec alliance and forget you were ever in Hi-sec, Spent 4 1/2 years in Hi-sec made more in 2 months in Null than any single year before.
---
ya and then you bridge a character in and they've never seen him anywhere near system and now they don't even know who to run a locator on
---
better than 24/7 intel imo, could be fun
---
rip non English clients.
---
the trend is just to do one language and do it properly so every one calls the same thing the same thing, even if its done badly.
---
You're fucking retarded. Constantly rolling for Eso holes? You null bears are so dumb. Just because you make yourselves nice targets for BB fleets because of how many capitals you have out and about at any time you also think we target you because of your alliance ticker. Stop feeling like victims. Your areas are just easier to find targets.
---
Events impact the economy even without special items or factions drops. If players play the even instead of ratting in Null or running DED complexes there might be less of the respective loot acquired, less ISK made with bounties etc.
---
There shouldn't be a problem in having nice drops during a event as long as the loot tables are as screwed up as with the Blood Raiders event some months ago.
---
Perhaps it would be wise to contract some security firm that specializes in these sort of things for a little while, not to outsource but to work with you guys to help you out with what you have available, to make most of it. Reputable security firms by default are very confidential. Their livelyhood depends on it.
---
I see your a man of culture
---
rsk for life
---
That‚Äôs amazingly accurate to how I felt reading it.
---
Whats the ship on the picture?
---
While I appreciate your enthusiasm, would you be able to elaborate a bit more on the points you mentioned? Because now it looks like you're just saying some things people dislike without explaining what is wrong in your opinion.
---
Another thing; What do you think you would do if you were elected to the CSM? 
---
Got cocky with 6 or 8 nyx's 2 jumps from there staging, didnt leave when we should of, we all got bubbled, all but two got out, went back in to save the two, Stewed was last on grid, warped to sun to get of grid (only align out of bubbles, he got caught.  All in all fun. About time BoT did that. Will be back to drop again tomorrow.  Quick shout out to rorq panic and cyno jammers making the game so much defender favoured.
---
How should alliances police for bots if CCP can't do it with all their tools is the trillion isk question? Punishing an alliance for botters renting from them when as players we have nearly no tools to determine who is botting is absurd. It is not the players job to determine who us cheating and they should not be held responsible for failing to do so.
---
Let's go even further and say I find a member of my corporation bitting and report them. How much of my corp taxes should I expect to lose for doing this? This is a besf case scneraio and as a player I am about to lose something for it.
---
Scammers won't tell you how to avoid their trap. They also look for a lot more than 10m ISK lol.
---
Indeed. Not everybody in "code" is part of the CODE. alliance. And sometimes random players suicide gank your ship just for the hell of it. It's tough to trust your neighbor when you're in highsec, so always be prepared.
---
GF, you guys caught one. Sucks to be us but oh well there is always next time :) 
---
No it only helps the defenders of a eviction eve more despite all the advantages they already have.
