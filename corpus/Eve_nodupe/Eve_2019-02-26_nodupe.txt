True. However, I would like to point out that if you ever stop killing ants, you will get more and more anthills (or nests depending on which ants) until you eventually can no longer live in the house. Bots and Eve are exactly the same.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, while it is true that eventually the ants will come back, maybe a season or 2 or 3 down the line and you have to do it again, you have nice ant free living in the house. Again, same as with bots and Eve.
---
Unfortunately, CCP is unable, due to resources, or incompetence, or maybe even unwilling because it affects their multi account whale business model too much (this would explain why they go for RMT so much but not after rest of bots unless they are made public and theres a big stink about them. 
---
Most likely, it is a combination of all 3 of these factors, but I fear the business unwilingness is strongest because whatever they do to limit botting in this regard also affects the multi account whales. Incidentally, whatever changes they make to the game that make multi boxing and multi account play easier, by default also make botting easier.

---
The eve economic system is a joke now. Gave up caring, it's not going to be fixed because Ccp never broke it. It's working as intended. 
---
White people are oppressed because...
---
*shuffles deck*
---
*pulls out card*
---
...they are charged more to play Eve Online.
---
I get what you're going for but the people who work on botting issues are not the same people making skins.
---
For all the effort you are putting into this, you really are wasting your time.   
---
All a google term might indicate is completely ignorant people who know very little about it. 
---
It has no indication or signals that the established player base is suffering or new people adopting the game. Simply not enough data to prove anything and you're just sitting with your dick in your hand and a smile on your face. Which, is fine, you do you boo. 
---
Botting wasn't an issue until you could Plex 20 of whatever PVE ship daily ...makes me sad.
---
I can "afford" a lot of things that aren't worth it.  That doesn't mean I'm going to pay for them.  Until CCP starts giving a fuck, I won't give a fuck.
---
It’s been a while since I logged in, and even longer since I logged in on fresh meat.
---
Frank please.
---
&gt; The developers are hamstrung by management
---
FTFY
---
Lol then don't rant about it if you don't give a fuck, go put your time and money somewhere else. 
---
Your thread, your point and your general lack of knowledge about statistics and data are all shit.   
---
Ok, let's be abstract here. Botting is really just procedural generation an in game item, that has inherent risk where you may take a loss, but usually you end up with some gain. If you take automated mining to be this type of game, then there are plenty of examples. Pokemon, or any monster breeding mechanism would suffice. Eve has a system for it for some items as well, but I'm not 100% sure what it is. Research?
---
If everyone is closed minded about a system in game to set up and monitor mining operations then fine it's not worth it, but the reality is the game doesn't have a natural way to scale up the operation. Drones sort of help, but I think the problem is that any system that reaches a certain age eventually gets automated. This has happened countless times historically. The smart people in Eve have realized how to automate the most boring task in Eve. I see this as a signal that the game needs to move in a way that makes mining less profitable by making it easier for everyone, or that it needs to be more risky.
---
I'm also not saying this is the only solution. I actually think Eve could randomly set NPCs to raid mining operations. That's an easy enough win but I think it would actually piss off more people than help.
---

Says the guy giving anecdotal evidence as an unironic counterpoint. You're a joke.
---
the issue is ccp doesn't release official stats, so we have to go by less optimal statistics
---
we can see the player numbers, and they're down
---
we can count the bots, and they're up
---
we can see the alts, they're up
---
we can infer that far fewer people play today than did 2 years ago

I don't see you coming up with any ideas. This sub has become a shitshow of whiners about mining offering no real solutions besides "find the botters" as if it's an easy problem. It's not and half of the braindead idiots just want to bring out the pitchforks not realizing CCP is a company. They aren't going to do anything that isn't profitable for them and they also know the core players are leaving in droves. Why would they beef up anti-bots? If you're crazy enough to want to run operations like this, you're probably crazy enough to pay money for plex. This is a solution that adds more content, and probably won't piss off existing miners. I don't see it as a loss and I'm willing to bet money this gets implemented in some way in the next year.

 What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

You're great at your job, which is protecting your region/coalition operation on reddit through narrative. Wish I had some valuable asset or goal to protect - I might have more fun at this game like you do

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

I mean, you say this, but with directly comparable weapons on directly comparable platforms, medium AC on cruisers/bc are a strong example of a part of the game where frequent small iterative balance steps would work brilliantly. They have had no niche nor has their t2 ammo really been good in a while (for hail, arguably ever, as it has never performed like void/conflag, for barrage in the last year at least). Start playing with falloff/optimal/tracking/damage multipliers iteratively in small steps till they perform in the wild as they should - get under laser tracking to win, kite blasters to win.

Well that would be pretty cool. Instead of destruction, the station would turn into derelict that is inhabited by sleepers or some other ships. Sprinkle debris around and like abandoned player ships for scenery.

Did you just think that you could fucking fool me with that comment of yours? I've searched your name up in the Navy SEAL database and you have never even graduated BUD/S, hell, even served in the Armed Forces. If you were actually a Navy SEAL, then you actually know how to spell guerrilla, you fucking moron. And you say you are the top sniper in the entire US Armed Forces and have over 300 confirmed kills. If that were true, then why the fuck is Chris Kyle a household name and you aren't? And plus he only had 160 kills. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. Plus why the fuck would you say you have a secret network of spies yet you just revealed that you had your secret network of spies? Are you a fucking idiot? If you can kill someone seven-hundred different ways, then list them all, I bet you can't even come up with seven. And if you had access to the entire US Marine Corps arsenal, then why the fuck did you just say you were in the Navy SEALs earlier? If only you could have done your research prior to posting your little “clever” comment, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you goddamn idiot.

Elephants are grey.

I don't agree that dipshit OP is bringing any useful data to the topic though.

2x Analysts working manually on this problem. Let that settle in the next time you spend money on Skins / Plex... that the funding you provide aren't being allocated to areas of the game which cause the most concern.

&gt;these will either buy or their accounts will expire
---
if that were true then there wouldn't be multiboxing, SP farming, botting on the scale that it is right now and we would not be having this discussion in the 1st place because players who initially supply the plex would not be turned off from the game and quit, while those who consume it would do so at drastically reduced rates and it would have stayed balanced.

nah don't be silly just a guy going afk

1.5 bil ratting Nyx. 200 mil difference between it and a ratting carrier but it also makes a hell of a lot more then a carrier and gets more out of insurance. Actually, when I think about it, its even cheaper to operate then a carrier when you sum everything up.

I know the player driven and fueled economy is the best, but they seriously need to add in some form of basic/low tier items being sold only by NPCs to remove vast sums of cash out of the game

As a medium low SP toon &lt;50m I dont think it should be like that.

I think a new account should have restrictions like that, and age/sp total should increase amount per month. 
---
The problem is alt farms and injecting new characters into highly profitable professions instantly. Slow that down and we'll be good. 
---
it's actually clefairy

I agree with this. It would make ratting a bit more involved, but it would also make afking them harder if you have to pay more attention to them, and would hurt non-botters.

Think about the easy work around. Make 1000 new alt accounts in alpha. 1 year later people start selling aged accounts.

3/10s and 4/10s can be finished in 5-10 minutes
---
they're in highsec so there's zero risk
---
they're everywhere. you can make 200m isk/hour running highsec DED; 100% risk free and nearly afk.
---
Sure there is. For example, if they switch to memory reading, then jsut weak encrypt some little bit in memory, since its weak encrypted it wont cause any significant issues and dont need to do it for everything, just something small that will make a bot malfunction.
---
As for visual bots, just like there are image reading bots, there are already counters to them as well. I googled this a while back and there is a whole bunch of stuff being used.
---
It is a never ending fight that goes back and forth just like any other IT / Sec issue. The only thing that is certain is that the moment you stop fighting it you completely lost it already and due to a wide plethora of reasons, CCP is not fighting it anywhere near what it needs to.
---
I run alot of 6/10s in Molden Heath and Derelik, and i gotta say that it's my favorite form of PVE. It isn't as consistent as ratting, but the estimated isk price value in that wreck always makes my happy. I got a Centum A-Type EANM just recently and selling it for that 1 bil isk is so much better than seeing a little bounty notification every 15 mins. I wish noobs ran more DED sites in hisec, as they are so much more fun and engaging than the typical null VNI ratter. 
---

Huh, I'm just a shit pilot then - that's the fit I use. :(
---
&gt;Then ... logically the way to avert this scenario is to subscribe to the game to vote with your wallet for the better financial business model (subscriptions). That, and avoid spending anything on PLEX, period.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;As you said yourself, unsubbing forces the game to become more dependent on PLEXwhaling as its revenue stream and thus CCP has an even greater incentive to shove more and more microtransactions in.  
---
&gt;If we want to turn this trend around, we need as many people to subscribe as possible. Show CCP that the subscription model isn't dead.
---
My better logic is to use that little box that you get when you unsubscribe and stay alpha. Then see what happens / develops, if anything at all.
---
Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, but would it be possible to plant bots in a known botting Corp to expose the Corp for botting and get it banned?

In this fight i fucked up with drones. I must stay at range and 1-2 shot scoop/deploy with curator, but i lost them.

Lets be honest here, it's not the '15 rorqual account' guys that are complaining. They give zero fucks as they make 140 mill per hour per account minimum. That's 2.1 bill an hour...which is 2 days mining and bang all accounts paid for. They give no fucks because of this. A months sub can hit 4 bill and they don't care because, assuming they don't get zapped in the month, they easily pay for their investments. 
---
  
---
    
---
Here is a thought experiment. Rorqual miner with 15 rorquals mines only on the weekends, 8 hours each day, for 8 days total, thats 64 hours/month mining.
---
64 hr * 140 mill = 8.96 bill per account. Let's round to 9b for simplicity
---
9b * 15 acocunts = 135 billion isk / month
---
15 accounts * 2b plex price = 30b per month sub.
---
15 accounts * 4b plex price (hypothetical) = 60b per month sub cost.
---
As you can see at current prices if said miner does 8 hours a day average for 8 days (weekends, but could be split a few hours here and there during the week, 64 hours total in a month which is only 16 hours a week mining) ends up making currently 100 billion profit per month AT THE LOW END at current plex prices. If this miner is smart and does moon mining and picks the good stuff or has access to R32/R64 like someone who has 15 rorquals (90% chance they are in Goons in this case, let's just be honest here) their profits could be up to 50% more if they hit Imperium public moons.
---
So this is just to prove that your hypothetical '15 rorq multiboxer' that you posit in your OP give zero fucks about what John Doe and his 1 raven L4 mission runner does because in the grand picture, that L4 mission runner means nothing to that miner. It's simple realities of how badly CCP has balanced the game. People will go down the path of least resistance, we all know that. You have seen 'get rich quick' schemes on TV, newspapers etc, you may buy lottery tickets hoping to win and get out of your rental house and buy your own etc. It's the path of least resistance and humanity is conditioned to go that way. It's the exceptions that like to go down the road less traveled, for it to be harder for them, willingly. Most want to go down the fast lane to success and fuck anyone else they pass on the way there. Sad but true
---
Yea, you nailed it due, starting from fucking super new newbs in ventures, the whole thing of just "lock on rock, start cycling and wait" just needs to fucking go. Its needs an active component to it. Some actual play.

I've got a question about something I saw today. I've been through quite a few wormholes, but today I found one that directly connected two nullsec systems (by that, I mean you start in one nullsec system, splash, and then end up directly in another nullsec system.). I've never seen one that didnt have at least one J-space system in between. Is that normal? Do they happen often?
---
Are 6/10s escalations or do you scan those too? 
---
I see multiboxing Rorq pilots being pretty upset now when their own shit is at least partially to blame for their own plex problems.

This is normal. You can and will see wormholes that connect two k-space systems. Their rarity is somewhat hard to judge because w-space denizens rarely encounter them (for obvious reasons) and so they don't commonly get mapped with the various tools out there. But for alliances that do wormhole mapping, they'll take advantage of these direct wormholes to do roams and raids to distant space.
---
You’re missing the point that I really don’t care
---
We are, we are unsubbing, some just going alpha, some quitting, etc. consequently there is less of us, initial plex suppliers in the game. At the same time, the game feels less live and organic as it shifts towards more multiboxing, botting, etc. See ? Adapting.

---
OK. I'm good with them getting a little bit of their own shit that they themselves have a huge part in creating.
---
&gt; Then see what happens / develops, if anything at all.
---
"What develops" would be exactly what you expect to happen. Game studios are businesses, not charities. They maximize profit from their *paying customers*. If you are not a paying customer, someone else is -- and it is their spending habits that will dictate the future of the game. If you play for free as Alpha, that still represents a small burden on the server - a burden that has to be repaid somehow. If not from you, then from someone else.
---
The more people unsubscribe, the faster we accelerate the game towards incentivizing PLEX purchase by any means necessary. After all, the money has to come from *somewhere.*

yah there was one time some dude got into our hole which was bubble campped but he was able to burn out of it, but he got tornadoed, and his pod got off. I chased him around for like 20 minutes before he safe logged. I then rolled the hole.  Next day I see his body on dscan.

---
Can confirm :-D
---
Honestly your this bad at reading the sentiment of statements. 
---
Like it seemed clear to me that nobody went fuck any changes we want the game to be in the worse possible balance state and get an AT. 
---
A majority of the angry sentiment came from the form the messaging, like in my eyes ( and I suspect many of the other people but I have to careful not to project my thinking on other people ), eve is moving in a more and more mass warfare direction where personal achievements are losing more and more value, now removing the AT seems very much agreeing with that vision of eve for the future. 
---
Most of the folks that are unhappy with that direction where unhappy with the AT cancellation, not because it's the AT but because it's symbolic of a larger problem. 
---
Now you sorta give the game away in this statement: 
---
&gt; Leaving those of us who trying to figure out what the majority of folks want 
---
Here you give the game away if your goal is to represent the majority, you should just appeal to the big nullblocks because they already make up the majority of the game, this means to appeal to the folks who join the game get into a rorqual ASAP. 
---
Like that's the major player base now I don't think it would leave the game in a long term healthy state, because it means the content that most of the older players grow into as tidi lag fest become more and more boring, but it's what the majority wants.

There's some people that smartbomb anoms for for escalations, but I just scan them down in lowsec.

Man you dudes are pretty assblasted over that guy hey

All thats been coming out of delve/ftn past few months

So much anger. Lots of words. Bad idea bad.

&gt;Meanwhile i just went to check new anomaly in our WH
---
I've had people ask why I scan down every data/relic site. Little do they know that every one of those timed sites I've done have gotten me 200m+

i still have nightmares about that fucked up eve radio station advert

Thank you for your honorable and valiant work. Your reports are always so fascinating. You are the resistance. Keep your voice.

You call that satanic? You gotta take it a step further man.
---
* Remove skill extraction. You trained that now non-existant rorqual? To bad loser, you're stuck with most of those skills. 
---
* Along with limited respawn rates, regions deplete when over mined/ratted, leaving them useless for months. No more turtleing in Delve, spread out or die.
---
* Remove all existing combat sites, replace with new sites based on abyssal and drifter AI and site design. This includes the space weather, hazards, and randomness.
---
* Stations now require a mix of fuel blocks and cap boosters to run. A lot of cap boosters. A player has to manually feed fuel blocks every couple of days or it immediately goes into low power mode.
---
* All data sites buffed heavily. (no /s on this one, CCPlease)
---
* If a station spends more than a couple days in low power mode it drops to 1 HP and asset safety is disabled. Everything can drop.
---
* To compensate for power creep over the years, CPU and Power grid management skills are being removed with no compensation. This will lower the potential for fits to be optimized in any way without also gimping themselves.
---
* With no more skill extractors, let the skill injector market slowly die as the supply runs dry.
---
For when you can’t find a big tiddy goth gf... you make your own

When I saw the video, I kinda wished CCP whatshisname would have used the thing in his hand to deliver a message from the playerbase to the company.
---
[removed]
---
Wormholes or Incursions would earn you a few billion in a week of moderate play.
---
The trillionaires get that way through market PvP though.
---
No. Get out.
---
I do, and every time somebody else storms in and grabs the loot just as I'm about to. EVERY DAMN TIME.
---
"6.8K views"
---
Explain this please. Which of the two behaviours that you described are inline and against the company's interests? How so?
---
Idk if I've ever seen us manage to form that many pvp caps, half the time when our caps do warp in we hope no one noticed they're pve fit
---
Oh yes i remember that. The hello kitty kestral. How ccp have loot changed 
---
People with trillions are generally doing market PvP, which takes much less time once you have it figured out.
---
&gt;Hello everyone,  
---
&gt;I'm gonna be your CCP\_Satan for balance team today. I don't know much about the game so bear with me.  
---
&gt;So let's start with inflation first. For starters, we are removing rorquals completely from the game.  
---
&gt;Second, we are limiting the amount of ore/rats spawns in regions. Once you mine out that certain amount, you need to move into other areas or wait for the ore to respawn.  
---
&gt;Third, we are adding randomized spawns on the combat sites, with certain enemies that will "counter" scripted bots.  
---
&gt;Fourth, there is now increased "upkeep" tax for player owned stations, that increases based on how many buildings the corporation has. This will only affect the biggest corporations and limit spamming stations just to annoy others. There is also increased anchoring time depending on how many stations the corporation owns. Part of the increased upkeep cost will be added as a reward for players that destroy the station.  
---
&gt;Fifth, we are adding more loot to sleeper data/relic site containers.  
---
&gt;Sixth, Stations left unattended for a long time in low power can now be destroyed by sleeper fleets.  
---
&gt;Seventh, CPU &amp; Power management skills have been removed from the game and compensated with increased values.  
---
&gt;Eight, Skill Injector skill points can no longer be applied to certain skills, for example, capital ships.
---
Sounds good to me
---
just starting the game, what are goals i should set out to do as a new player?
---
its true. you are right, I'm not sure which one he is either. But I am sure when I see a fucking Rorq krab that is the cause of lotta this shit in the first place.
---
How active is the incursion scene? I've read that there isn't as much participation nowadays, since nullsec has gotten a lot more profitable. From what I can find, it seems like the big players *were* WarpToMe, The Valhalla Project, and The Ditanian Fleet. How are these groups doing now?
---
dont worry. hell probably be botting tomorrow after dt...
---
But that way you can shoot both sides and have twice as many targets! Don't blame the messenger, it's not my fault that FW has always been broken as hell. For me NOT shooting people sounds more lame and not fun.
---
Some nerd has probably already done that 
---
There has to be a general sentiment that most players will agree with - things that need to be fixed immediately or things that everybody complains about or acknowledges are an issue. If there isn't, it becomes extremely difficult to prioritize and that's when it looks like CCP is just jumping at every shitpost on reddit to determine what needs to be fixed at the time. 
---
That's why most of us tell them to ignore reddit, because it's extremely rare to see the community actually agree on something being an issue - this being a perfect example of that. 
---
The AT will be back next year, but that hasn't stopped everybody from flipping out about it and reading more into it than simply what was said. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. 
---
delete local. problem solved. 
---
lol, i remember in 2013 when people cried because it hit 1b wishing it was 2009 again.
---
I've been playing this shit so long I don't remember what it's like.
---
I like it. 
---
You should also add, that ISK is ridiculously easy to make now, so people who used to buy PLEX to put on market, likely have found much more time/cost efficient methods to generate isk.  
---
I used to buy PLEX to fund my PVP habbit....now I just log in my Rorq/Carrier toon and watch netflix while making fat stacks.   
---
ISK is to easy to get now, everything is cheap as fuck. Why would anyone buy PLEX to put on market these days. Shit average player (couple dozen hours a week) can make better isk as an Alpha today, then you could as an Omega in 2013.
---
Im up 4.5 tril isk since jan 2018
---
Not to mention how many people unsubbed from the game due to the Gala event, AT and other bullshit. They sure as hell were't in a PLEX buying mood, sale or no sale.
---
4k a month, and that is just the banned ones, then you add the ones that have not been banned. Although, no idea what the actual breakdown between omega and alpha bot is due to lack of data.
---
Even if you did care, CCP doesnt. So its a win win.
---
Youtube searches count. 
---
I understand that if we just stopped caring we'd have a far bigger problem on our hand but like dealing with ants we can't give people or companies grief about something that's widespread and if they see ants, even after treatment, they think that no one has done shit when we're doing all we can. CCP could be doing more to make botting harder but bots as a general problem is something that we shouldn't be shitting on CCP specifically for. Everything else about the game and the changes they make are free game but the issue of botting isn't something that's easy to address because if it was that person would be millionaire and bots wouldn't exist anywhere.
---
I mean that’s really up to you. Try out as many areas of the game as you can and then make some decisions on what kind of stuff seemed interesting, what corp to join and what long term goals you might set. 
---
[MRW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNz8ZsFxgM)
---
Big old titties.
---
Also, the bots could have been subbed with cash, and all the isk earned be kept, which would put a hole in your theory.
---
ok but is there anything every new player should do that will help out a lot in any area?
---
Not to say that they weren't reaching for the first excuse to come to mind, but, now that you mention it, I've been wondering why my EVE client uses 50% more CPU in combat than I remember it using...
---
wheres the payout
---
wrong
---
im not \~ really \~ back.
---
Idk why these people put bots in renter alliances like this, surely a large easy to join blob like TEST, Goons, or Horde would be better because it’d be a lot more inconspicuous 
---
Damn. You are right. Its about roughly what I did too. Subbed 1 PvE account, 1 misc kinda all-around account, and plexed my PvP account, especially that I had a habit (which I might pick up again) of PvPing only with certain people, so activating a plex once in a while worked out much better then subbing it.
---
I totally forgot about that.
---
Do your introductory stuff and complete all the career agents to get a sense of what there is to do. Do some combat missions. Get a solid understanding of the basic mechanics, how to fly your ships, how the different racial ships and their weapons systems work. Plan to move out of highsec within six months. 
---
Head into lowsec and lose a frigate in PvP. Then do it again and try to survive longer. Internalize the fact that it's OK to lose a ship. Avoid the trap of continually putting this off until you've trained more skills or saved more ISK. Find a small corp that does something other than mining. Volunteer to be responsible for something, like leading a fleet, or managing a project, or recruiting. Scan down a wormhole and go through and see what happens. Look for relic and data sites you can hack. Commit to paying for a subscription when Alpha starts to feel limiting so you won't get hung up on grinding for ISK.
---
Plan to leave your corp when it becomes apparent that they aren't planning to progress beyond highsec. Look for a corp based outside of highsec. It could be big or small, in low, null, or w-space. Your killboard history is your ticket in almost anywhere, since it will demonstrate that you are enthusiastic to try new things and aren't hobbled by risk-aversion. Search for leadership opportunities so you can start to appreciate the politics and the meta. Pretty soon you'll be a well rounded pilot with an above average understanding of how EVE works and what fun it has to offer, and you can choose a field to specialize in.
---
Sadly,  [u/Gangrene\_Chaser](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gangrene_Chaser) was caught attempting to Blackmail WERMT members by threatening to tell people they were botting unless they paid him 5 billion isk a month. Due to this fact, he has lost all credibility, and his posts should be ignored.
---
Sansha space has dank a type enams also, *and* intact armor plates
---
This sort of killmail is why I never take my carrier out to rat. I think I'll have mined myself a super before I have the 'nads to do it. Mind you, I've mined myself 2 dreads (hanger queens), 3 Faxes (hanger queens) and a nyx bpc (taking bets on whether it will be a hanger queen or not). 
---
I don't agree with this. You wouldn't design your house to be ant friendly like CCP has designed Eve Online to be bot friendly would you ? Also, if you did design a house to be ant friendly, would you be surprised that you got ants and then try to kinda bungle about trying to keep the ants off once they started getting even on you ? Or would you take much more immediate and much more drastic measures ?
---
While I may have some agreement with not giving them grief, I will definetly not say it is undeserved.
---
And even that rock will kill a shitlers super.
---
Laugh all you want but the only game I know that has been as active as eve is for this long is Chess.

olalal rimilsa t'est sérieux plus sa va plus tu t'enfonce......... arrête de te prendre pour alors qu'en 6 mois de guerre chez darkness t 'as jamais rien foutue......... -100 pour un post aussi useless
---
It's a premiere annual event to remind Highsec that we are here, that appeasing us matters and that as usual, we've always been the premier outlaw gang on the block. No one else can do blowing your ships up quite like we can. It's a form of power projection to show the universe, that nowhere is unreachable by the Imperium's long arm. Hard Knocks got hit in wormhole space, highsec pubbies aren't safe either, even if for years they've been cuddling up to Pandemic Horde.
---
In all fairness, who doesn't try to figure out whether an EA game has a launch date before backing it?
---
How does it even die wouldn't the passive Regen be enough to last until down time?
---
I never said I wouldn't exterminated the ants and I also never said I wanted CCP to ignore the issue at hand. Maybe you misunderstood me but all I wanted to point out is that botting is a difficult problem to solve as a whole. Also even if people plugged every hole, made sure their home was clean as a top pharmaceutical company, made sure they routinely had someone make rounds and put precautionary chemicals in place you'd still have ants or other insects invade your home. We can sit here and talk about the different ways CCP is shit but everyone knows CCP had torpedoed it's image with their actions faster than retards bombing their own fleet and is why I no longer play.   
---
For every solution we come up with, for every countermeasure we can theory craft and put into place, there will be people out there who will make it their life goal to go around these blocks. Does that mean we should just do fuck all? No but we need to understand that it's not something we can just snap our fingers and say we did it! Calling an exterminator is easy because they have the chemicals in place to address the issue, there's not such an easy solution for botting.   
---
Note: I'm not defending CCP and never have or will ever do. A lot of the shit they get is warranted and the jackasses in charge are sinking the ship faster than the captain of the Titanic.
---
I'm used to it just fine, it's literally the deluge of data that confuses me. There are naive like 5 or 6 stats I care about in most modules, but pyfa gives me 20 in alphabetical order. It's like a first world complaint really
---
You do realise it's mathematically the most obvious location?
---
Where did the "big fiddy goth gf" meme come from?
---
This is not true. 
---
The terms were 5.5b per month and I stop cloaky camping. This had nothing to do with botting.

quit before you find yourself having wasted valuable time you could have spent on improving yourself, quality time with friends and family, reading, going outside, or just enjoying life in general. One day you will realize you've been playing Eve for years and didn't even enjoy most of the time you spent playing it and could have put that time towards almost anything, instead all you have to show for your time and effort is some pixels. This game is addictive and a money sink, quite before it consumes you.

Definitely start with the career agents if you haven’t already. Those give you a light introduction to quite a few things. 
---
I would also join in on some NPSI fleets. I haven’t looked into these in a while but I’d check out Spectre Fleet, BjornBee and Zarvox if they are still all running fleets. Bombers bar as well once you have a stealth bomber and cloak trained. These would be great ways to potentially meet some people, see what corps are out there and what kind of combat you’re into.

I've hung out with him a couple times, he is a cool dude. Maybe I should give him a call and see how hes doing? and of course tell him that his vid made it to r/eve.

Lol - Delve is not safe.

This shit isn’t the player’s fault. 
---
The people literally in charge with balancing the universe are. 
---
Considering i've FC'd for them for years, I think I am pretty qualified to speak about them. It should also be noted, WTM has a policy of only contesting when contested. Not to mention, and I can't believe I have to say this. WTM STILL RUNS HQ'S. TVP DOES NOT.
---
NO HAVE A BOT IN MY CORPO
---
modify the programming
---
Your not being trolled I’m just stupid
---
So lets get this straight. You want to remove rorqs cause you don't like other people being able to make isk.  You want to give advantages to those who own alot of space, IE the north. (Which ironically was a complaint in the previous sov system that coalitions could hold to much space but oh well). I actually have no comment on the third idea. I actually  agree with that one. Bots = Bad. Same with your 4th point to a degree. I don't think you should negatively effect mega corporations. 5.  You want more loot for less work. 6. You want CCP to destroy stations for you, because lazy. 7. You don't want to train skills.. cause well lazy. 8. You don't want people to be able to skill into capital ships cause you are poor I am guessing? dunno. Maybe you should go get a rorq. 
---
I wouldnt say remove rorquals but everything is pretty much on point.
---
A shield moros eh? I like that.
---
Im not talking about using PLEX im talking about actually buying the thing and putting it on market. 
---
this is the most amazing goon comment I've ever read. It's got everything:
---
1) TNT (but only the botters) are (pseudo??) renters now
---
2) "lol didn't want that nyx anyway"
---
3) caring so little that you go to reddit to tell everyone how little you care
---
this is it. you may not like it but this is what peak goon looks like
---

---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/auvfsz/probably_botting_nyx_dies_right_next_door_to_1dq/
---
Ya because folks multiboxing 15 rorqs give a fuck about PLEX being 2B.  
---
Guess what the real answer is.  
---
The number of people who buy PLEX to sell for ISK has declined substantially....because ISK is too easy to make.   
---
That is not what happened. Jibrish speaking jibrish again.

Interesting story and great AAR.  
---
I'm All good, I know the dangers and make sure I have a very balanced life, I always put my Ms and little one before anything else and work before games, I'm just very casual and only play for a couple hours after work weekdays and make sure to go out and about on weekends even if it's just a kayak down the river, thankyou very much for your concern tho, I've seen the damage video game addiction can have on one's life and have come close to it in the past but luckily I have a family that helps me keep my eyes on what is important
---
etcetera
---
Right on.
---
&gt; Sure there is. For example, if they switch to memory reading, then jsut weak encrypt some little bit in memory
---
:facepalm:
---
How, exactly, do you plan for the client to operate on encrypted data?  Decrypt it?  In memory?  Where it can be read by the bot after the client decrypts it.
---
Oh, also your encryption key is stored in memory in order to use them.  So the key can be read too.
---
Please consider the utter failure of this example when you propose additional solutions.
---
&gt; As for visual bots, just like there are image reading bots, there are already counters to them as well. I googled this a while back and there is a whole bunch of stuff being used, just not in Eve Online and few other places that deem it "not worth financially".
---
And all of them are as ineffective as your encryption proposal.  If a human is supposed to do something based on pixels, the bot can too.
---
If you’d like an example, let’s return to Overwatch aim bots.  Those posters with images of the characters that fooled aim bots?  They were at specific locations on the map.  So the bots were modified to not react to those posters because of the fixed locations.
---
Random locations?  Ok, now you modify the aim bot so that the target has to move.
---
&gt; It is a never ending fight that goes back and forth just like any other IT / Sec issue
---
No, it’s very possible to secure systems.  But it requires limiting control access to the systems.  With multiplayer games, that’s not possible.   The botter has admin access to their machines, so the client can not be used for security.
---
&gt; CCP is not fighting it anywhere near what it needs to.
---
Based on your encryption plan, I’m not so sure you can properly evaluate this.   Or anything regarding security.
---
&gt; while CCP lawyers are about as skilled as their event programmers
---
I really, really want to hear your totally realistic plan to sue in, say, Russia.  Against a Russian national.  Who has assets in the thousands of dollars.  And is only known by a pseudonym.
---
Because it’s gonna be even more funny than your encrypt memory plan.
---

True. The price of plex is going to increase 400%-500% from where it is right now before it stabilizes if we keep this status quo going.

Generally speaking, you don't. The thing is, if you're moving the drones will trail behind you and so will lower their own transversal, improving their application. If you're stationary, then only your sig matters, but at that point an acolyte (for example) still hits even a 15m sig object 87% of the time. Practically speaking, the only time light drones miss is when they're still orbiting you at hyperspeed before their MWDs turn off, which you can't really control.
---
If you want to make light drones not hit you, you have to outrun them by going over 6k (ish) m/s - a fast interceptor, in other words. You can tank them with actual tank or outrun them, but you can't sigtank them.
---
Dam, may be my crazy experiment is a lost cause. Thanks for the advice. Oh well, on to the next crazy experiment :P
---
Don't get me wrong, you can still perma-mitigate light drone DPS if you try. You just can't do it by sigtanking.
---
Ok OP. I'll break it down fairly simple like here. 
---
1) Botting is bad because then no one would play of it were legal. Why play at all when you can write a script to play for you? Secondly, the absolute unfair advantage. Personally I spend half of my time awake playing eve, a decent chunk of that grinding for fun. I make my isk the honest way instead of running my credit card. If someone Bots they get the same benefit without any of the work. That like you busting your ass to take a test, and the kid in the next seat pulls out his phone and googles the answers. 
---
2) Lore wise, AI is banned because of a prior event where AI went berserk, killed folks, and started replicating uncontrollably. This event saw all "Strong AI" research banned by CONCORD. 
---
Here a wiki like link for you to read while you reflect on how incredibly stupid you are. https://fiction.eveonline.com/new-eden/lore/AI
---
TLDR: if you want a game that plays for you while you're not on, theres several mobile games with this function. Uninstall eve and play those.
---
I actually like that I can come back after a few years and it feels like I'm playing the same game.  Many games constantly hack and change their games until it is unrecognizable and not the game I enjoy playing.  
---
That being said, CCP's pace is even slow for my liking.
---
Looks like numbers dropped. Are players ...*gasp* paying attention???
---
you have to unsub forever
---
You know thats abbreviated to Etc. Right
---
And we're back to afk moon extracting
---
Flying a Hel and no even on a shield Super you take damage (\**lol\** like 2% or so... but still).
---
But I'm docking/tethering way too often cuz farming sites grinds your gears so the damage can't accumulate much.
---
I heard that on Nyxes they often times dropp into said Armor and only repair if they're chewed half to death.
---
 Before quiting cuz the game became shit I could rat with 2 supers at once on one screen in different sites
---
/&gt;imagine boasting on reddit about feeding a nyx for a few dread killmails lmao
---
Ah hell yeah, that’s my fetish
---
yea man we're pro
---
Nice of you to not include the other conversation where the threats were made. It was a nice racket man, sorry it had to come to an end. You cannot run around trying to play the altruistic hero while attempting to extort people. Now sadly many bots will go unpunished, because your words now mean nothing. 
---
Maybe so, but your posting isn’t lol

If you’re doing over 6km/s cold with a frigate non speed-bonuses light drones will apply horribly. Even if they can catch you like warriors, they will hit you once, turn off their mwd, and then start chasing again making them apply like 20dps to you so you can tank them for an absurd amount of time. I use a cheap tackle Slasher that hits around about 5km/s cold and it is essentially immune to non speed bonused hobs and hornets, and unbonused acolytes and warriors can be tanked for over a minute assuming that you’re not receiving any other damage.
---
We got a spike after the 'this is eve' trailer on YouTube.... Not Google searching "Eve Online"
---
Keep typing up those minutes Falcon!
---
20B a month without farming day and night? Thats what, 4 hours a day estimated? 120 hours for 20 bil aint that amazing. 
---
i too was also only pretending to be retarded
---
Triggered
---
mar5hy and is 20+ alts would never make any dent in delve.
---
I am not the owner of, nor do I possess the logs in question. If that person wishes to share them, they may do so. 
---
Flying less value cause they are fucking wiser 
---
I love this argument. Well, they have a small cache of 50-100 titans that can be dropped. So ye, they had less, but with the possibility of dropping the hammer at any time
---
If you're going to make up lies about me, at least have the courtesy to fake evidence for everyone. As it stands you have none.
---
So stop using skill farms to fund my casual PVPing so someone else could plex easier? Not gonna happen, friend. Time is precious.
---
well, if I look at the numbers of upvotes I got. It seems that ye, ppl are more or less happy with how CCP handles it...
---
Don't understand me wrong, there is alot to do. But it should be done with thought, not just because of the outcry for (mostly stupid) changes
---
Pathetic, half hearted attempt to defame me. At least you tried?
---
How many times per month did you get carpal tunnel syndrome though?
---
Interesting read. Actually sounds kind of fun bot-hunting, but how hard is it to do solo? 
---
I love how every time a super dies in Delve, a member of the Imperium immediately posts it to Reddit. Is this Mittani "control the narrative" orders?
---
Oh look at the downvotes roll in from the Imperium brigade lol
---
some loser alphaempire'd the kill before i could
---
so i'll show that FUCK by posting my OWN post with an AAR
---
Ahhh yes, how could I ever counter your completely editable paste of a text file, of whatever conversation that was. Ask yourself a few questions, was that the only time you did that? Could their be other people out there with similar stories, pieces of information, etc? I'm under no obligation to provide you or anyone else here with my sources of information. If they wish to believe you, they are free to do so. 
---
Here’s reddit’s history on the [subject](https://reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7mv234/where_does_big_tiddy_goth_gf_come_from_and_what/)
---
There seem to be older, less complex variations that predate reddit, though.
---
I already reported The.Ring weeks ago, murdered a bunch of vnis and get yelled at by gewns for killing blues, its quite helpless and sad that they are defending such OBVIOUS bots (they are awful, dont even fight back, or target you)
---
"If they wish to believe you, they are free to do so."
---
And if they wish to ignore your baseless rumors, they are free to do so. 
---
It's pretty fun the first couple of times, then it gets boring, frustrating. It can be hard to do solo as some bots are now immune to the more 'traditional' methods of hunting them. Blue scouts are the best way to catch them.
---
You can't extract tears from bots and the perpetually AFK.
---
CCP can't even outsource their own chat so god please I hope they don't bother.
---
Slasher fit you say? Let's ask our neighborhood friend, Jake 'The Numba Won' Stutta!
---
they can all initiate warp by fleet regroup btw
---
Thats the ones. They are not nice to do, as they take alot of time. Payout is good ofc (in average), but lets say you are doing a sansha 6/10, then even after 30-40min spent, you don't get a payout, you are like "well ok".
---
Serpentis you have to do both escalation parts + they scram, web and neut sometimes really heavy and the worst you get probed down, people can warp directly on top of you, wherest in all other 6/10 ppl have at least take the gate to get to you.
---
And when you're done after around 1,5-2h and you get nothing, you are not going to be happy.
---
And when i hear that people are farming the sanshas or guristas ones and do like 4 or even more per day and take that as comparison for serpentis ones ... then the day is over as it takes you like 6-8h maybe even more to get to all sites, wait out possible hunters and such.
---
Jesus, thank you for the reply.  
---
Back to /pol/
---
To PvP

True we've killed their tower and their bot that was in it.
---
https://zkillboard.com/br/107472/
---
I don’t think that OP’s idea is a viable one... but your taunt reminded me of [screeps](https://store.steampowered.com/app/464350/Screeps/), which I had almost forgotten about.
---
See they just played the system by not losing it.:smart:
---
Teaching a whole new generation of Eve players that they need to pay attention to what's going on in this game before undocking! Hopefully...
---
This is what makes Eve what it is, you can never give people the option to not PvP. Just think - anytime you undock you are consenting to PvP! 
---
Nope. Whether you had skills queued up isn't their problem and they don't care. They won't give you anything.
---
Pets is arguably a compliment. I like pets. I loved my dog. I like pet corps. They're filled with cute newbros and pay for themselves in relieving the bittervet. 
---
Alliances like evictus tho? They're closer to renters. 
---
Guess most of them are in lowsec and as soon as someone "not blue" enters local they warp of? 
---
But what would be a good ship/fit for solo hunting? 
---
I’ll take your advice, I gave it a try solely for exploration and damn usually it’s 100mil per site, I can only imagine how many careless people there are that don’t pay attention, it really is a gold mine haha, what do you usually use for your stain adventures, I was thinking a stratios?
---
If you didn't have stock then you are doing it wrong. 
---
I chuckled at 3 killmarked hel
---
They all in nullsec. 
---
Probably a cynabal with 3 hyperspatial rigs if you don't have an interceptor alt. 
---
I’ve been having bad luck with wormholes tbh, to the point it seems nonwormhole sites are more efficient isk/h
---
We could even grow a bot army and have it march out to ore sites and collect resources.
---
You know, since CCP has more of an interest in mobile games now than ever.
---
You have nothing to lose if you ask them
---
Are guristas as good as sanshas btw?
---
:unsmith:

---
My eyes. The goggles do nothing!
---
https://youtu.be/y91uHr-QW6A
---
I agree, any change, such as removing local, and the bots will adapt - however I don’t believe that means we shouldn’t try some things...you seem pretty against it? 
---
I’d upvote but I’m not sure whether to hit Endurance or Prospect. Or which one is Endurance or Prospect. 
---
Fuckin’ mods
---
Uh, excuse me, I think you mean CFC/thosebeeguys, thank you very much.
---
Quality shitpost.
---
Well carrier ratting is not per se the issue here. I mean everyone can rat in whatever he likes to ... you got a titan you rat in it? Probably funny to take it for that, but it's yours, do as you like.
---
It's more like this guy is 13 days old, injected into a super straight away and died in a site, not even by players. A VNI would survive the site and yet the basically 2nd most powerful ship type died in it.
---
It's the ignorance of alot of players, thinking that the bigger the ship, the better suddenly the outcome, only to realize that it's not the case and eventually blaming CCP that the site is shit, the game is shit, and everything is shit.
---
waaaaaaa waaaaaa waaaaaaaaaa
---
Keep it up! 
---
Holy fuck the irony of _____ pick a faction, region, type of space, activity. Pick a hand and point it to a random region. You'll find bots there. What do you expect from typical frat member? Running a bot farm? Maybe selling ISK to feed his family.
---
In wc botters aren't welcome but as everywhere, some of us have bots too.
---
Well, to be honest:  
---
there was an attempt.
---
My lord, is this legal?
---
A guy once tried getting recruited into some sort of Christian coalition by a young guy that said he was saved from his addiction to violent video games! 
---
I took the bait and gave them my number because I was on a binge and always it's fun to talk to these guys when I'm drunk. Needless to say I had regrets the next many weeks as my phone was red hot.
---
It do be like that.
---
Pretty sure that’s not true , if you have subbed your account I think the reimburse the lost SP 
---
Point 7 should be point 1. It is the most important one!
---
Keep in mind whatever you want to tackle probably has longer webs and scram than you do
---
Nope. Whether you're subbed or not, your training queue is your responsibility. If you don't have stuff on it, that's not their problem
---
You’re right, Stratios is one hell of a nice ship ! You have the ability to cloak, and can actually do a hell of damage to whatever could find you. 
---
However, the Stratios is quite slow for a Cruiser, which mean completing exploration sites will take longer. You should try to take a look at it’s younger sister : Astero. Can kill other explorers for those shiny wrecks, and so long that you don’t encounter a Tech III cruiser or Stratios, you should be good.
---
You mean it looks....all white 😉
---
fuck yeah I’m elite
---
That's strange. Earlier this month I didn't train an account for almost 2 weeks and they gave me all the SP. I've done this several times in the last 5 years, and they've always been cool and given me the SP. Not sure if they've changed policies or you're just being an asshole, but I guess your mileage may vary OP.
---
Eh, it's a good name for a Titan.
---
I wish I could bee as elite as you
---
I don't Google for pictures of my own car. I do Google for pictures of car crashes.
---
&gt;bwugghh my shitty, exploitive playstyle is being attacked! 
---
Tl;dr
---
Thanks mate. Here take my upventure
---
They try though. Sad that for every ship they catch, there is another 50 mining/ratting peacefully. Delve machine breaks for nobody.
---
Every skin on every ship, never forget.
---
&gt; wise

&gt; High-seccer
---
Pick one 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Damn when i noticed those huge placeholders i hoped CCP is working for something nice for us ... and this was just related tot trig ..... sad. 
---
But StainGuy, you don't mean for CCP to take a page from Dust514 by having a unified skill point pool where all the SP you grow coalesces, thus invalidating the need for Attributes and their associated implant shenanigans, since free SP is twice as valuable than applied SP.
---
That would be terrible! /s
---
You would need to break a lot of eggs to make Eve fun again. I'm hoping that one day there will be a hardcore server with CCP\_Satans mechanics. I lost hope on Tranquility.
---
Lolol
---
This is how all battle reports should be written.
---
No one wants to read all these 100,000 word dissertations we see on Eve Reddit.
---
Better to work bit more than ship non working client.        
---
Look at the chat server, we still don't have it working like the old one. 
---
ur posting has gotten so good lately
---
I just give it my personal best, Brax ❤️
---
This is some quality bait

Can CCP Deliver anything at this point?
---
Who said this is bait?
---
Don’t let your memes be dreams sweetie

Being forced to join fleets once a month and being a F1 pressing e-sheep isn't a big problem. But calling it 'pvp' is kinda far fetched.

Shh. Don't focus too hard on him.

It's requiem, his only subs are retrievers. He thinks leshaks instantly win. I'm pretty sure he doesn't know shit about the massive downsides trig ships have. Doubt he's flown them more than ten times 
---
Nope.      
---
Current injector price is due to fact people injecting 20-30mil in one session.

Whole idea is that no one can do this any more.

True, forgot skins exist
---
There's a midpoint between releasing constant updates, half assed updates and updates that take years.
---
Look how long void bombs were a thing. How about ferox nerfs, how long did that take. What about the fax nerf that didn't fix faxes and they need further adjustment.. Still?
---
When will tiericide be finished for bonus memes. 
---
Realistically, ccp doesn't make changes, even when the answer is simple. The retribution nerf took months, was obvious and fixed the issue to a large extent. Making semi regular updates is not hard 
---
Sorry about your orca
---
lol havoc if only people read goonfleet dot com, there would be a lot less deaths
---
Marshy and ol-meek-ah are too good at this spaceship game

This sums up my burn jita experience except I didn't get dropped I just mined the whole time
---
Soon^(TM)
---
i have a VNI w/ 8km's, all from killing ~~Bots~~ Elite NPC's
---
Had about as many gameplay updates as chess too
---
I agree. The main issue I see is "silently". No communication about it. 
---
Also, no new project for the next updates, it seems there is no more roadmap.
---
Oh i see damn. 
---
Can we just get rid of anomalies that are warpable without scanning? I mean this would solve a lot of issues .
---
you have my ear citizen 
---
wait there is a randomize button? i wasted countless hours on my ~~abominations~~ characters
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **1st Cakeday** MinerDistraction! ^(hug)
---
This has been my experience as well
---
It's definitely worth asking, the worst CCP can do is say no
---
you are welcome
---
It's really random.  I've done monastery 4 times in the last few days and I get 1-2m worth of loot.  I do a random ded 1 and I get 40-50m sometimes.
---
I pyfa'd the rlml Cerb and it looks pretty dumpster compared to Orthrus, honestly.
---
Cerb has insane range and higher kinetic locked-dps, which i doubt even counts as a pro, cause it has like 30% less total damage per rlml clip.
---
In this state of the abyss meta all-in dps fits do not work well at all, as evidenced by the early 1300dps vigilant and deimos fits.
---
Orthrus however has
---
* choosable damage type (without penalty)
---
* more damage per clip
---
* speed/control 
---
Tbh a reasonably pimped (800ish mil) TD Orthrus IMO doesnt have an easy counter if flown properly.
---
* anything turret based will absolutely cry cause 20km scram an tracking disruption, also 850ish dps with abyssal weather is no joke
---
* Gila gets one drone tracking disrupted for optimal (zero actual dps) and the other drone primaried, until you're ready to all-in on the gila w/ pvp weather
---
* Curse drones get primaried, then mjolnir fury under abyssal weather
---
* any ab overtank you cant break is 2b+ and cant kill you
---
Basically dont be me and forget that you cant activate heated scram while repairing launchers.
---
I do hope you realise the ramifications if they fuckup the deployment of the 64bit client. Let them delay it and don't give them shit for it. 
---
It's a monumental software development undertaking to retrofit a 15++ year code base with 64bit.
---
Hopefully, we see similar improvements in a similar fashion when they did the brain in a box work.
---
CCP - Cunts Cocksuckers Productions
---
They don't pay their sub like you and I...
---
what a wholesome thread
---
Who?
---
&gt; don't give them shit for it
---
I'm sorry this is r/Eve here, this is not possible.
---
There is a time and a place for giving them shit though. I sometimes forget this is /r/Eve. Thanks for reminding me xD.
---
They are gearing up for a bunch of 'surprise' events, these are probably not road-mapped out on purpose.
---
I'd say the player owned structures were a slam dunk.
---
Agreed, but that was a while ago (except for the POS replacements)
---
No they explode on this subreddit and it will be a pr disaster. Remember the fucking launcher? Jesus christ this sub is toxic
---
So.. like all campers he asked isks to leave system? So rude! 
---
He should have given them a friendly hug and a lollipop maybe?
---
I havent been able to head to triglavian space. What fucked up?
---
&gt; As more and more of our pilots migrate to 64-bit operating systems
---
serious question, how many are still on 32 bit operating systems? are 32 bit desktop processors even a thing still?
---
You know what CCP make sure it fucking works before shipping it... Dont be EA
---
Oooh... I see where you're getting at now.
---
Wouldn't a sort of Skill Injector fatigue work better? First time you inject you get full SP but after that you get diminished returns until some days passed? That would nip the bud of those pesky day one Rorquals.
---
You just posted a link to eve updates website. Is that not by definition a communication?
---
&gt;There has to be a general sentiment that most players will agree with 
---
No there hasn't and there never will be because eve has too many diverse playstyles for such a generalized position to really exist, this is also why the CSM isn't 1 person, the idea being that you represent a diverse community with a group of diverse people ( yeah that worked out great ). 
---
This is also why groups not represented by the CSM complain the loudest because there aware Reddit is there the only path to CCP.
---
&gt; things that need to be fixed immediately or things that everybody complains about or acknowledges are an issue.
---
This depends so much on where you live and what you do, that such a generalizes position can't exist because people often have contradictory goals. 
---
the idea of an eve player hive mind on changes or even a general consensus is not gonna happen and honestly trying to represent such a position means advocating for often contradictory idea's, it's almost as if Reddit isn't some unified hive mind and different groups of people face different problems. 
---
&gt; That's why most of us tell them to ignore reddit, because it's extremely rare to see the community actually agree on something being an issue - this being a perfect example of that.
---
The issue with going ignore Reddit the question becomes in favor of what?
---
Like your original position was you when you ran for CSM you where gonna represent all eve players, yet you seem shocked that eve players as a group have contradictory positions on what eve should be. 
---
Like, have you not look at the issues before running for CSM because honestly, that shouldn't shock you now it becomes way more visible over recent years granted. 
---
Likely because a majority of the playstyles don't have a representative to contact, so the can either shitpost about it on Reddit or quit the game when their playstyle get nerfed into the ground because there is nobody there to point out to CCP why it's a bad idea to do X. 
---
&gt; The AT will be back next year
---
I already have a remindme for this standing out, now given the shit storm it's like something like the AT will be back ( i suspect it's gonna be way more minimalistic than the format in past years ). 
---
The AT as pointed out a week ago by multiple posters (and pointed out by me above), isn't so much an issue as it being symbolic. 
---
&gt;  but that hasn't stopped everybody from flipping out about it and reading more into it than simply what was said. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
---
The reason most people read most into it then said is because of the way CCP communicates things.
---
Like most of the balance projects don't get canceled they get delayed and we you don't hear anything about it anymore it's likely canceled. 
---
When you do this enough people especially the older players are gonna start reading delayed and canceled as the same thing. 
---
Haha....
---
Hahahahahahaga
---
Ha
---
What would google know. Bunch of hard data collecting mofos... liars!!!! They hate eve etc etc
---
....
---
Just listen to yourself...i mean really.

I knew this was fake the moment OP mentioned a line goon reading the forums, otherwise this is probably the best post around these parts in weeks, maybe months
---
everything you need to know is here : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml?fbclid=IwAR2bfVlcxTD4-QF0OGskqeEeipvUInKanzyF6wyDdsG9YQWODdwytlp9o40#
---
use pyfa and be sure you can handle the dps and the neutra
---
watch out if your wh have an affect (passiv shield myrm or drake are great but not in wolf rayet)
---
If none of what I said make sense for you, you haveto google harder about WH before diving in ^^
---
ebm?
---
Or maybe just give an injectors max amount. You can only inject 20 injectors. After that you are on your own. Same with extractors. 
---
very clever sir
---
6/10's are 800m-1B per hour if ran right. So that's 20-25 hours. Still a lot of time spend farming. But a lot less mind numbing then 300-400 per hour super ratting. 
---
It would actually lived if it was a shield super ... with tank, passive hards tbh

I remember Mineclub was going crazy when i cloaky camped them. Also their Super / rorqual were so easy to hotdrop, now i understand why.
---
I'm going to add my own satanic suggestions based of dumb ideas we had during last nights rage roll and chill.
---
Look at the statistics over number of pilots in systems, remove the bottom 10% from the game. Invent spooky fluff to justify.
---
The other suggestions included remocing Stain entirely and perhaps a good chunk of the drone regions. Only the bots would ever notice it was gone.
---
On this occasion - have you heard about lack of lowsec gat to Stain? 
---
Were the torpedoes delivered to the right address?  Sometimes they get mixed up in delivery.
---
Yes, they arrived right to his hull, but without the receipt!
---
i have reasons
---
This is not the first time I hear about this. How will I trust their company now?
---
This feed sounds like all the people who run 6-7-8-9 accounts are angry because they cant play a game for free anymore. if you cant afford to run all those accounts with RL currency then dont have that many. The average account per player has also grown concidering most large null sec alliances want people to have FAX/Super alts. Its not CCPlease being bad its us changing the game and expecting CCPleases bottom line to adjust to our whims. PPLease stop moaning. We have a game that 90% of the time works. Take BF5 on release some nerds paid over £70 for it and it still didnt work. 
---
Youd be amazed how many people still play on toasters. Its one of the few games that actually runs on very old machines.
---
This could also have been affected by CCP's war on botters over the last 3+ years. 
---
technically yes. mechanically they are a nightmare

One week ago, this update was planned for the winter update. They just changed it to spring/summer.
---
Gotta max out them sliders
---
Isn't that just a copy and paste of the Winter 2018-2019 'upcoming update'?
---
"this is fine"
---
This is a really cool tool. I didn't expect so many features to be included. Thanks!
---
This is minor, but in the Settings sheet I can't set Skill Extractors to buy from buy orders. Is this overlooked or a consequense of a game mechanic I'm not aware of?
---
I have no numbers to show - I haven't even fully get around drone stats in pyfa yet - but I do have firsthand experience: a malediction going 5k/s can easily tank drone damage by occasionally pulsing the SAAR. That's more of a speed thing than sig thing tho, I'm afraid. 
---
Bots aren't ants, they are pets. If you don't want dogs on the public playground, you don't start to act against the dogs, you punish their owners.
---
I think this is the way to go. The bots are working for "legitimate" players -- punish them. Bot accounts are not valuable. Get five banned? Create five new ones. Or ten. But all the profits eventually go to accounts which are valuable to their owners.
---
Follow the money flow. Use moles who pretend to sell ISK via shady RMT sites and ban the customers, ... The risk of any RMT outside the official PLEX sales must become big enough, so that nobody does it any more.
---
60 character. i went to the 5M SP with alpha on each, took 1,5 - 2 years because of the time to skill the 3 character on each account and cost almost nothing : skill book and some implant. While they are training and alpha you can use some for pvp too :) After when they are omega, they are with full implant +5 and never undock from jita.
---
For me it was really an easy job against VNI ratting for example. Just few clic a week. The starting is the worst when you have only small skill.
---
that's called a meta. know what happens to games with a stale meta? they die

it was 1:42 AM and you were watching this. m8

havoc is a national treasure

for sure one is elite at multitasking if you manage all that.
---
i can smell the salt coming from this one
---
Not surprising at all. I'm pretty sure their codebase is shit enough that it breaks when recompiled to 64 bit.
---
That's beautiful OP

[¿Qué?](http://i.imgur.com/JhecQF5.gif)

Yes that's how they'll release quicker. Let's just make the graphics designers code the back end client 
---
It's not, because you can cyno titans in at 200k away, and instablap the inhib, then cyno in the rest of your reinforcements. 
---
Have you done any whaling in delve?

You miss your titan so much?

I’ve seen a question concerning wormholes connecting two known space systems together, and I have another question regarding this. While exploring through nullsec, I have found a super large connection from nullsec to highsec, the ones that can be used by dreadnoughts, carriers and FAXes. Can those holes be used by capitals to send one in highsec, or do they get an error message when trying to jump ?
---
Yeah, that seems about right. Not that much code to write honestly, and you can add some random delays to things to make it look like it could be a player who is doing everything, rather than perfectly running the anomaly (which will provide more ISK/hr, but a higher chance of being found out). Then add something where your bot cannot do things in more than one client at the same time so it looks even more like a player.
---
I am so sorry that your friend did not have a complete and enjoyable delivery experience. Unfortunately, due to the large volume of orders we have we sometimes have paperwork issues. I will gladly take care of sending a receipt to your friend along with our survey and other feedback tools as soon as I get into the office! Thank you for choosing WiNGSPAN and I hope we get to serve you again!
---
Obligatory not a wormhole Corp.
---
an event is not a road map for the future of the game, its a money grab. Caue there will be new skins with the new event and new crap loot. etc. 
---
A road map for eve, at least imo, is that we know what ccp has planned in the long term for eve. Lack of a road map gives me the i dea there is no long term idea's for eve. Only more mliking of the present player base, to fund other, soon to be in the dumbster, projects.
---
At some point CCP has to realize they hit the jackpot with creating eve and that it was a ones in a lifetime something. Keep investing in the game and communicate this and the playerbase will stay loyal and also invest.
---
We all know something has to change and it will hurt us as players (muh, ticks, muh yield) and it will hurt ccp, cause subscriptions will be ended, But it has too be done is eve wants to stay healthy and going for a couple of more years.
---
Lets fear the worst and hope for the best.
---
New skins are more important, please be patient just wait, pay for plex and buy all new skins
---
and noone is suprised
---
plex should have a maximum price in game. I suggest 1.5m isk for one plex maximum.
---
I'm a goon, of course I haven't whaled in Delve. But I have whaled under other folks' supercap umbrellas, and yeah, you need to make sure you are doing what you can to prevent someone from burning another cyno into system, that's true. Part of that is, yeah, knowing how to control gates and keep eyes out, such that if things do go sideways you're already off-grid.
---
That's the game. Inhibs aren't an "I win" button, if they weren't -- if there wasn't any counterplay -- there'd be a problem. But there is, so ultimately your job as a spearfisher or whatever you want to call it is to use inhibs to their strengths, and mitigate against their weaknesses.
---
If you weren't aware of that -- well, welcome to EVE, I guess.
---
Aw... bless. You guys don't feel relevant enough, is that it? 
---
"Guys.... guys.... we're here.... notice us.... please??!?!!??"
---
For what it's worth, I didn't ;)
---
Fffffff
---
They can't jump to hisec.
---
What a surprise... I told /u/ccp_falcon 2/3 years ago when they announced Serenity was closing and inviting their beloved Chinese community to Tranquility with open arm that they were opening the gates of hell and set the gears in motion that would lead this game to it's doom.
---
Everyone already knew including CCP that Serenity and it's economy was completely destroyed by botters yet they continued to ignore all the evidence in persuit of more money via plex and skill injectors. 
---
The security team cannot keep up with the influx of new bots being created on a daily basis and with a sometimes months long investigation rmt'ers and botters have nothing to fear. Thanks to skill injectors botters just make a new account and put them in a botting carrier the very same day. The exploration/Astero bots I wrote an article about in January 2018 are still going around on different and brand new accounts that who are all in the starter NPC corp. (If you go now to the killboard's Astero losses and look for starter corp Asteros with a t2 relic analyzer and  PW protected can in their hold, it's a bot.) Managed to get the first 50 banned after a 4 month almost daily 'report bot' button spamming and encouraging others to do so too.
---
I think we can all agree that this game is beyond the point of no return and it would need a miracle to save it from this mess.
---
*Just an idea that popped up while writing this: Since the Chinese server got revived it would maybe be smart of CCP to allow the players to move their account entirely to the new server with assets, wealth and SP included. Because right now those players that are here on TQ are not going to move as they have all their wealth and assets here on TQ and who the hell would willingly start grinding back up from scratch, right?
---
I dont get all the fuzz about it. They said 64bit will be deployed either in march or april. Even their CCPlease page states this since its launch.
---
Judging by the comments in this thread I should probably start using incognito mode.
---
You say 2 days, but I reckon you means about 16-20 total hours that normal people spread throughout a week
---
The sheer amount of SALT in this thread is unbelievable!
---
I agree with you as the orthrus is probably better, In most If not all case (I think its only really good against orthrus If I can tweak it tank to deal with a whole clip, I feed like two of them because I still had the dampener fitted and no blue pill) they have the same damage per clip only If cerb use kinetic 
---
I think the highter ROF might be relevant In some case (Like against active armor ship, my pyfa say 2.62 orthrus vs 2.02 cerb OH). 
---
I toyed alot In pyfa to search something new and fell for the "over 1k dps" meme as I wanted mostly to live the dream of killing a target In less than a clip, and finaly made It happen. I think i'll fly It again a bit and I might try the orthrus aswell 
---
tired of kicking this sick puppy.. i mean you kick only so many times before you wonder "is this really helping them" :D
---
You are missing the important part... 
---
Did you guys see the new SKINs though?
---
Mhmm, I don’t really understand why they would do this...
---
I know for sure that those diamond rats are way more advanced than the regular ones we can find in anomalies and combat sites, and are there to defend the mining fleets or act as tougher rats for highsec players when a FOB is nearby. However, why would they attack a citadel ? Is it a new way to get rid of the spam, or simply random encounters ?
---
The really funny thing is that they literally copied the Winter articles and called them Spring and Summer, without even changing any wording. 
---
Screenshot of the two for hilarity: https://puu.sh/CRW6a/d729eecb92.png
---
More balance updates coming in ~~winter~~ ~~summer~~ ~~winter~~ spring.
---
They never ever caused any issues other then the joy of thousands upon thousands of players. Never had so many of my alliance members sitting outside our Provi nullsec station buying random ship skins and random ships just to see what the outcome was. And this went on for days. Golden Drakes &lt;3..... But CCP does not want joy for free they want you to pay for it. 
---

Suing botters? lol... This gotta be the worst suggestion ever on how to fight bots... Do you even realise how hard it is to sue somebody in a different country, especially if we are talking about European country and for example someone in Asia??? On top of the jurisdiction thing - its a fkin anonymous person on the internet, probably with a VPN. It requires FBI level of resources and influence to actually find them IRL.
---
Even your spais should know, you turn on TACO before you undock.
---
Why are these ideas always terrible and/or based on faulty data?
---
As someone who sells skill injectors, it's rarely the case that someone buys more than 1 or 2, likely in an effort to move along a long skill train such as JDC5, or perhaps to get into T2 guns before an upcoming fleet.
---
Sure, you could buy 100 injectors and get your self a day one rorq alt, or you could just buy one off the character bazaar, dealers choice really.
---
&gt; Quit before you find yourself having wasted tons valuable time you could have spent on improving yourself, quality time with friends and family, reading, going outside, or just enjoying life in general.
---
Fuck those things. Why improve myself when i am going to die soon anyway? I have no friends. My family sucks. Reading hurts my eyes lately. Outside???? WTF is wrong with you? Enjoying this shitty hellhole of a place full of worthless individuals, that we call Earth? 
---
Nono my friend, exactly this fucking ugly world is the main reason i am escaping to any fantasy i can. 
---
was there not just an Eve Pulse??? No mention of a delay there...... Instead of all the bullshit they do there, maybe use it to communicate with the community???
---
You skipped right past the most important part! There will be ANOTHER Agency redesign!  
---
(That was sarcasm, for those of you born without a properly working sarcasm gland)  
---
#Oh i see that guristas sotiyo patrol found a raitaru.       
---
This one was also in the last winter update announcement and was delayed too. But meh agency 
---
Heh And I remember those used to be triple the value a couple years back...
---
Well on the bright side, the 100 people playing eve in the summer will have the dankest of skins to choose from
---
That's fair. It is in fact closer to 12 hours of playtime and i enjoy doing it.
---
damn right i mean they don't brag in reddit like those ncpl-skillu tryhards
---
More Guardian Gala style and quality events .....
---
I never sold/bought injector on the market.    
---
You always go to supplier to save yourself and him the fees. 
---
That's a penis!
---
Nothing new... literally.
---
Aha, but which Summer.

---
How's the pest control going?
---
🎵And another one broke his bot🎶....
---
Any of the wormholes that connect to highsec will have a mass limit too low to permit any capital ships (minus freighters) to fit through thus preventing this from working.
---
Good point well made.
---
To be fair, that is quite comedy. Cheers for the laugh.
---
tbh you can only blap bads/cheap fits, and then you can do it w/ orthrus as well, if not better (choosing damage type vs. RAH etc.)
---
Cerb could have some niche use vs. Orthrus yeah, where you just fit an ADC and tank one clip no problem
---
Cyno inhibs aren't working as they should; they need resists so that a couple of titans can't just blap them off from 200k away even when you have 10 logis repping it, after being cynod in by some random nullified instawarp inty. They should require the enemy to gain subcap dominance on field, as I stated in the last post.
---
Once you have done your career agents I suggest finding a corporation. I personally suggest finding things to do besides mining. If you enjoy mining then it is fine to do as a semi-regular activity. However, many new players become completely reliant on mining and never explore other parts of the game. Explore the game and find people to fly with, EvE truly is a game about the people you play with.
---
&gt; Character bazaar didn't increase number of specific pilots in game - chars simply changed owners. Skill injectors allow instant creation of such pilots.
---
Limiting new accounts to 5 injectors in the 1st 30 days is a more reasonable adjustment, and way more likely to be implemented than any gibberish that gets posted to /r/eve as a "fix" to what is wrong w/ eve.
---
See that huge white box on the left with the words placeholder written on it several times?
---
Capital shield extender 1.
---
I rushed towards bigger ships, but I couldn't fit them properly and ended up losing loads in missions e.g. I was using a Shield Tanked Scorpion for Level 4 Missions. All my low slots were cargo extenders...... I used Faction Ammo which actually lost Isk even when I completed missions.
---
Joined a corp. People pointed out how wrong my fits were.
---
12 years in I now mostly fly T2 &amp; T3 frigs.
---
funnily enough, there is 1 frame if the video [without blur on The Plan](https://i.imgur.com/RuepDi3.jpg), (isn't readable anyway becouse camera was moving :(  )
---
YEah they use asic miners these days
---
Eh, resists won't do that. Anything that makes it harder for titans to nuke, is gonna make it even more difficult for subcaps.
---
And, well, if intys have you down, smartbombs are your friend. Know where they're coming from, set up your bookmarks, and delete that cheekyboi as he hits grid.

---
Mid April in this timeline. Fits with spring/summer imho. But don't know what date it was before.
---
Running wormhole combat sites can pay well. If you want to daytrip then it will be a lower investment but at higher risk to your ships and lower payouts. Moving into a wormhole can pay extremely well. 
---
You should also consider just scanning for data and relic sites. It may be a nice change of pace.
---
Factional Warfare is an excellent way to get an introduction to dangerous areas of space and make loyalty points while waiting for a fight.
---
If you have no found a corporation then I highly suggest doing that. The more support you have, the better. I cannot recommend EvE University enough. They offer many activities and educational services to help you learn and enjoy the game.
---
You pre-overheat BEFORE landing in target
---
You DO NOT mash F1 in TiDi 
---
.....
---
Anyway, awesome tears. 
---
Why rent somewhere and expect to get help from landlords that dont undock?
---
yeah happened to my corp mates too lately, except they weren't using a guardian.
---
wingspan is not what they once were.
---
uh yeah actually you can sorta do it but yeah i agree its not optimal, forgot eve was single thread....
---
:) you've only watched the at havent you?
---
amen to that
---
All this work for...what?
---
Funny story, on my first day of EVE I saw his mixcloud linked in local and was going to joke about it, figured I'd open it first and it's actually pretty good. I believe I told him as much.
---
Try out abyssals for a cool pve experience
---
Umm I’m not sure how. I’ve tried using old machines and it tells be the graphics no longer support it.
---
I still wonder why anyone should ever use the Agency. I mean, I have nothing against it, I just wonder why giving projects lige Activity Tracker and Agency so much attention, when they bring no value in ingame experience, I don't know a single person that used it more than once (a player that tried Resource wars once, and then never did it again). I mean tthings like the Upwell structures or the new map for example bring a new game experience and have improved the game, but the Agency and activity tracker? Maybe CCP should acknowledge, that it's not their design of the agency, but the agency itself, that doesn't get used.
---
cant wait for the balance changes to be a few number tweaks that could have been done a year ago
---
They desperately need to communicate a long term plan to the community. There seems to be a general lack of direction and from talking to some other vets, they feel the same. Since Andi left there hasn't been a big update showing us their long term ambitions, plans, or anything really. 
---
I guess increasing the range of inhibs to grid-wide would be a better choice, as that would force the titans to warp to grid and then you can intercept if set up correctly. 
---
It may well be a case of the 32-bit client and the 64-bit client not being able to be released side by side. I can't comment as I don't know the in's and out's in that regard, but you are right. We could always "Rollback" but it's not an ideal situation by a long stretch.
---
I'd imagine partly to help stop citadel spam and party to create some pve content and make the world feel more alive
---
It's like we all forgot about neverodd.
---
Tribute. Or at least the west of Tribute, it's completely dead, I made a ton of ISK there a few weeks ago.
---
How come there's no structures for the other 2 main pirate factions (angel cartel and serpentis)?
---
Also they should really he in NPC null but whatever
---
For 1 account? 
---
they are too busy stream sniping folks to do their jobs correctly.  such a shame.....you cant find good help these days...
---
God no, that's even worse. You want a cyno inhib to be an automatic "trail of tears" device? Get outa here.
---
It's fine as it is. Learn the counterplays, and then, like an adult, mitigate them. Welcome to EVE, there's actually sometimes strategy at play.
---
Love it. See, we didn't die and killed your stuff. We're leet.
---
Question; no events scheduled? :(
---
Yes, I know the last one was a shit show... But I have hope that CCP can grow from that HORRIBLE crap! o7
---
Too much bleach in the cleansing-mixture?
---
You are obviously an economic analphabet, not understanding basic rules of demand and supply, why should I argue with you. Its like talking about paintings with a blind man. 
---
Where does the PLEX and Extractors come from that can be bought with ISK in the market? Do you summon them with your magic powers ?
---
So wait - just make 50 alfa accounts now so when you want new rorqual you have a char that is old enough for instant injection?
---
&gt; weak encrypt some little bit in memory, since its weak encrypted it wont cause any significant issues and dont need to do it for everything, just something small that will make a bot malfunction
---
This could work up to a point. Blizzard already does this in WoW at least. [Source](https://torrentfreak.com/images/blizzard-bossland.pdf). This creates extra work for the bot devs which means there will be fever bot developers left due to increased barrier of entry. Now that 95% of the script kiddies have been eliminated you can perhaps focus on legal means on the rest of the bot developers (especially if they sell their bot for profit).
---
Blizzard was able to remove Honorbuddy bot from developer by doing both of these things.
---
Another approach would be to insert fake information in the memory, while not showing it for players using the client. E.g. you spawn an invisible enemy that has the same properties as a normal enemy. This could perhaps reliably distinguish bot from human since humans won't even see the invisible enemy in the first place and won't attack it. However bots would read the enemy location from the memory and start locking. Now once the bot targets this enemy we would know it's a bot since only a bot would be able to target this kind of enemy (normal client wouldn't even be able to target this enemy).
---
A third method would be to observer the behavior patterns of a character. E.g. Track their moment locations over 30 minutes. And see if a certain location repeats itself over and over. Other stats such as: playtime / day  or playtime/week,   time spent farming vs time spent on doing other activities could be a clue as well. Does the player/bot use chat often and if they do then do they repeat the same messages over and over. Will the bot always fit the exact same gear 20 times in a row and never switch ship? This could potentially be a clue too.
---
However there is no silver bullet that would definitely break all bots down. The most important thing would be to use several approaches to more reliably catch them all.
---
Impressive spreadsheet skills. I envy you.
---
I just did some rought math, as I don't have access to ESI right now.
---
Max sp per hour 2700
---
2700\*24\*30 = \~2mil SP per month
---
4x extractors: 4x $356,999,995.89 = \~1.4B
---
selling injectors: 4x $782,690,991.12 = \~3.1 - \~1.4 = \*\*\~1.7B\*\*
---
Is that right? 1.7B profit without PLEX? And plex is 1.5B?
---
range made It believable unlike blaster ) gotta find time to try out orthrus now
---
Maybe better irl Isk if done in waves?
---
But they did it on the page that lists about the updates. Thats actually what they have to do.        
---
Why is that worse? Is it because it might force people to not play supers online for every fight ever?
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/t/64-bit-client/131325/51
---
Tbh i never understand the reasoning of having a skin on a subcapital.         
---
You have to play eve on max zoom out to have view on the grid - and you never see skin on subcapital at this point.  
---
All that for +3 cpu -20 sig radius lol thx
---
Leave The Baltringues Alone
---
&gt;corp : The:Ring    
---
im not suprised, confirmed and reported bots, ccp dont care 
---
I think its propect and vulture
---
Dude, when you wanna roam, just form a 250+ fleet with cap support and a fax wall. It's quite clear you're the one not adapting to the elite capital meta.   
---
I even bet you're still manual piloting ? It's useless now, we're in 2019 : jump to cyno and smash your head onto your keyboard (depending on your current IQ, adaptation may take two or three more hits before reaching the current IQ of nullbear population.) then faceroll your keyboard while screaming "IMMA WELL ADAPTED MONKEYYYYYYYY". You'll get a kill or two, and get back to mining. 
---
That's how you play eve in 2019 bud, did nobody mention that to you?
---
(also, logan pls!) 
---
I'd love to move into a wormhole, but how safe is it if I were to not log in for a week regularly? I don't have a very consistent play schedule right now
---
 Looks like 2 leshak spawns in one room
---
but i like ze baltringues, Toilet Paper. is recruiting Jeko ! 
---
Yes, he clearly ran lines through all of the illegal stuff. No one will ever notice.
---
If you go outside and look up in the sky, you may see an airliner.
---
If you do, know that this joke is still further over your head than that plane.
---
Even when you read the desciption of the corp it sound like rmt &amp; botting
---
CCP are normally pretty good with this. I would contact support and explain the situation. They will tend to grant SP towards the character for the training time lost.
---
I'm not sure what SP/h they use a baseline for this though. 
---
The BAG8 Iz recruiting too
---
Please highlight the shipments you believe to be PL merch
---
Thanks in advance
---
Remember the good old days when you could only have one skill at a time queued up? And had to wake up in the middle of the night to swap queues, or put a long training skill on when it was patch day in case shit fucked up and you wouldn't be able to log on for a few days?
---
I really miss those days...
---
Aille nauw, gl to you bois! &lt;3
---
Try using classic reddit. When you do it - you will never go back. 
---
TY !
---
PS: tu l'as eu comment le tag papier toilet? je veux mon mien !
---
skins should only be super rare items worth thousands of dollars, and work like old skins where if they die they're lost
---
That is not particularly safe then to move in on your own, again, I would suggest eve university. If that isn’t your thing then go ahead and pm me, I can probably find you a group that you’d like.
---
Oh yeah, there are also Freeport wormholes where people have public citadels. Still not ideal for going away for a week regularly but that could work.
---
Say hi to casabian for me fisty. 
---
no these are both copypastes 
---
That's why no more $for eve for me. They even cancel fanfest because they know there will be nothing new to show... 
---
about 50 secs, maybe a bit more depending on the kiting ships agility. 
---
Also lmoa at this: 
---
&gt; fail to keep at least 30km
---
&gt; ship that is only 200m/s faster
---
uninstall irl you F1 pushing clown
---
Remove skill injector / skill exctractor, and do that ccp wanted to do before : SP vs $ directly.
---
No skill farm at all after that. and if you want to inject, you pay.
---
I could assume that alot of them don't even know what zkill is, don't interact with reddit and ignore local
---
Havoc this is at least the third time I've upvoted you this week. 
---
Are you taking night classes on gudposting? 
---
Has the real Havoc been kidnapped? 
---
This needs to stop. 
---
yea but your ship is stainless 
---
Can’t agree with loosing part, but the amount of skins is out of hand. Better more expensive, rare and good looking stuff then  hundred of skins nobody wants.
---
Thats how the next B-R will happen, contracted by Diplos of 2 Rorqual-strong blocks in a darkroom, to entertain the line pubbies and counter the problem of ore inflation in post-Lifeblood-EVE, where nothing really drives conflicts and the ore flood causing Rorqual ticks to sink....
---
You pay to inject now.           
---
1st someone need to pay a sub to train skillpoints, 2nd someone need to pay for extractors, 3rd due to reduced effectiveness someone need to use more injectors each "sp level" he gets.          
---
Too meta for me. 
---
I should have listened. Reddit IS a trap!
---
I find greentexts to be the ugliest yet most practical and readable way to present literally any event.
---
Didn't post on goonfleetdotcom. Must be fake.
---
If he blackmails people (what by the way is totally inside of EULA) that are running bots (against EULA) i am totally fine with it.
---
What will you demand next, that we should ban Jita scamming?
---
You should start a corp with a focus to hunt bots, save the galaxy.
---
LOL, you really think it's going to be any better even after they delay it?  It's probably so they can work on more monetization strategies instead of spending more time on it 
---
Now I see why they wanted to leave in rush, in theory it was because they were offended I admitted Logan back in WERMT (who they accused of awoxing prob to shut him up) while in reality it was prob to avoid the kick from alliance it'd come from me as soon as I'd have read this. 
---
https://picr.ws/d/vua.png
---
I made this some days ago for the people interested in my corp
---
Yeah, you would make the game harder for people who do not multibox while everyone else just uses their scanner alt. Good job!
---
You see them while docked. (At least that is why I use 1-2 skins overall.)
---
Because delaying things definitely means its not still going to suck when they do release it.  Worked out great for stuff like Walking in Stations.
---
Yeah for sure. They certainly tried their best to slander Logan as much as possible. It's a shame I didn't post this before they got all of their fortizars unanchored.
---
hehe. i remember, me having a discussion with CCP falcon on the official forums when the first new multi-layerd skins were introduced.
---
i was wondering if they might cause more cpu/serverload, since  the game has to calculate multiple layers instead of just one, per ship.
---
he refused this could be any issue. and told me it wont affect the game in any way.....yeah right.
---
ccp falcon : " 
---
This is one of the main reasons that we don’t just put every color and material set on every ship all the time, and fill the New Eden Store with 50,000 SKINs.
---
Each SKIN is performance tested on a range of systems to make sure it reaches performance standards that we feel are acceptable for gameplay.
---
.......
---
acceptable gameplay :D
---
People use the agency because CCP is making sure you have to, by putting everything in it.  Don't be too hard on em, Hilmar's 3 year old niece worked hard on it!
---
The problem with CCP is, they delay, and delay and delay...and STILL serve up shit.  Its as if they aren't actually using the delay to work on the project, they're just procrastinating and probably using the time to brainstorm more monetization options.  Then the "delayed" deadline comes and they're like "OSHIT FORGOT ABOUT THAT, OH WELL BETTER RELEASE IT NOW" in the same state it was 6 months prior.
---
I think ccp is spending a ton of resources on things that aren't content or balance changes and so I dont really know how we can quantify how much work they are putting in but things like months of time on : Chat systems, 64 bit client, war dec's, security counter measures, and other various things that don't add anything to the game, it's hard to really be happy with that kind of work.
---
They really need to either make a ton of balance changes or make them more frequent to justify this current scheduling they are doing.
---
yeah the propaganda from both sides for this latest northern thing has been trash lately.
---
2/10
---
So like clothes on on your avatar when you walk around?
---
&gt; all the pathfinding code you'd need to write
---
Yeah it can be a bit tricky. Even if you copy paste a path-finding algorithm from [Rosetta code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm). 
---
ideally you have your char trained in what you want to do with him and have an alt with +5 sitting in highsec 
---
They canceled the AT so their 2 non-SKIN devs would have time to update the updates.eveonline page.  Aren't you thankful?
---
&gt;  hundred of skins nobody wants.
---
you mean like the skins that nobody wants that are already in the game and cost a fortune?
---
shut up and buy some more skins.

\&gt;haha i bet we killed yyYYOU!!
---
lol salty. thx for the downvote.
---
cant handle the truth , eh? 
---
Wingspan *is* failure.
---
&gt;We haven't had a decent expansion since Citadel (No, abyssal space was not a good feature, still isn't) and before that, I would argue, for quite a long time measured in years.
---
Yeah it's almost as if eve development schedule moved from two yearly large expansions to 4-6 yearly smaller expansions. 
---
well, they just shifted the update in the future...
---
Honestly, most points have been covered here but I would suggest you look into the different aspects of the game and then decide if you want pvp, industry, wormholes whatever and find a corp to join who will support you though the starter steps, all games are more fun when you have someone to play with. 
---
that just means they're not expanding the depth or breadth of EVE anymore, which sucks.
---
Your posting is getting gradually worse
---
You could try exploration and DED sites in lowsec/null, if you stage from NPC you don't run the risk of losing your assets with your restricted playtime but it adds an element of risk which makes things a little bit more fun. You will make decent isk too from drops etc.
---
Lol wtf is a goonfleet dot com
---
There are events scheduled, they're called SKIN releases.
---
I for one think the use of starcitizen IP as voting buttons is a bold move
---
First Blizzard, then Bethesda...... And now CCP.
---
Don't you guys have phoooooones?
---
I'm sure they have enough material from old fanfests they never delivered.
---
so how u expect me to send u a screenshot of another palyers wallet? are u some kind of special retard?
---
no i will not post its name on reddit....like dafuq is wrong with you to even ask that?
---
people doing market pvp and industry for last 10 years, and doing other scams and schemes with a lot of alts simultaneously...isk adds up over time you know.
---
if 1 dude makes about 2-5 bil a day on multiple toons...300+days of the year...over a timepsan of 10 years+ ( or even less would make enough isk)  go figure. calculate upkeep costs of toons, and re-investements...and u still get a number which will blow your mind.
---
im pretty sure theres more then 10 guys ingame with above 30-50 bil isk in wallet/ wallets , each one could fund a big war....they simply dont bother with it, because why should they?
---
and now keep on raging about a topic which doesnt bother you at all ingame.
---
Such lazyness... 
---
If using chicken wire you're doing it wrong... Use ducktape and cable ties and you should be golden. 
---
It should be possible. They're actually shipping the 64 bit client at the moment (it's due to how their build system works. Not much more disk space being used, as the majority of it is for art assets. The actual code is negligible compared to that. as with pretty much all games) We just can't use it with TQ.
---
Nope, you're a dumbass.
---
this is some pretty dank content Right here
---
Did you seriously upload a structure bash video, one of the most boring parts of EVE in real time at that and expect people to care?
---
When can I buy the pink Eros skin for my Queen ?
---
use old.reddit.com or just change to classic view like rest of the people.   
---
Why would you use something else than classic reddit view? 
---
tvp died, nobody really does incursions anymore
---

Please point me to the 12-18 small expansions we've received in the last 3 years.

if it aint white it aint right
---
"except I didn't get dropped, my bot just mined the whole time."
---

---
Its sad but it seems more true every day without any new content/balance updates posted.
---
You don't. You leave it in high sec next to low sec system and use a regular freighter the rest of the way
---
Nothing to see here, daily eve is dying post.
---
No, you and yours have given in to your learned helplessness and invent your own justifications for not attacking it, actually. :sun:
---
Because I don't have oh shit cynos in every low sec
---
At least you can run one out in Korea without it affecting you citizen score!
---
Except most of them are poorly thought out trash. Like, the upkeep tax on structures per corporation or alliance? That one wasn't pondered for more than 3 femtoseconds before it was ejaculated all over the internet, like some sort of plague. Anyone with even any semblance of understanding of how structures work ITYOOL 2019 could tear that one apart. Shit, *I* was able to tear it apart. That should tell you how awful the idea truly is.
---
see what i said? it isn't dead, but given the shell of its former self it presently is, i'm almost inclined to prefer that it should be.
---
Lol no.
---
Bots still convert their earnings to Plex.
---
&gt; If a station spends more than a couple days in low power mode it drops to 1 HP and asset safety is disabled. Everything can drop.
---
you do realize when structures hit last reinforcement they enter low power mode, right?
---
There's nothing stopping you from killing it dead now. Extract all your characters, give them &amp; your isk away and unsub.
---
You can just daytriping if you are not sur about what you want. scan a WH from a low trafic HS. do some relic/data, gas, bring a PvE ship and print ISK. Then come back to sleep in HS
---
You can also join un low class WH corp (low class because you seem not knowing well the wh stuff). I think any offline periode shorter than 2 weeks should be OK (depending of the corp)
---
Finaly you can try to put your own citadels but it could be very risky. Are you aware that asset safety and citadel timer are diferent  in WH
---
Personally, if it meant improving shit legacy code and moving on from it, I'd choose that over expansions any day 
---
Yes. HAM Loki. 
---
i wonder.. how much profit could i make off of four hundred injectors?
---
Put your assets in a WH freeport citadel is the worst idie ever.
---
Easyest way to be scamed or evicted
---
Or both
---
Happy cake day

I chuckled, fucking poors couldn't fully inject to T2 guns on their 3 month old titan Char ...
---
like those led by Kim or the other ones Kim wants to nuke?
---
lol You nailed it.
---
I remember ring mining...
---
Outside of Abyss the stuff we did get was to finish citadels so that POS could be removed. Still in game.
---
tl;dr they are milking a dead cow...
---
If you have to buy the extractors, like 2-250b?
---
I know you're not really serious but don't extract your characters, if you're unhappy with eve right now just let your sub lapse. You might get the itch a few months away and your stuff will be here when it comes back.
---
The sad news is there isn't anything really like EVE, and there's no way we can just simply go back to RMR or whatever expansion people thought was good. EVE is always going to be changing for better or worse, if it's not the game you like anymore then you probably just need a break.
---
I've played since 05 and taken several breaks, its only natural really.

When I first subbed back in 2009, I used 3 days of my sub before my hard drive died, I messaged ccp to see if it was possible to “pause” an account so I wouldn’t lose subscription time,  they couldn’t, but if I messaged again when I was back online, they’d add the missed time to my sub. Bit different now with Alpha states and stuff, but worth asking about :)
---
With less then a few winter days left i say we didnt get any spring expansion at all. Maybe few tweaks for summer. 
---
REMEMBER WHEN THE LAUNCHER WASN'T EVEN A THING AND WE LAUNCHED TO A DANK LOGIN SCREEN WITH DANK REALX MUSIC?

what is your definition of "silently" since you're clearly linking the announcement from CCP?
---
I wonder how much the somer blink guy made before cap shut it down 
---
RMR Blood and Stuff btw
---
OP you need to go play X4.
---
I do. I also remember eve always had this new big thing coming in next expansion. But after citadel there was nothing. Only dead cold nothingness, like space itself. 
---
Jesus fucking christ, what the fuck is up with your overview, and what the actual fuck is that fit?

Not printing a receipt usually indicates tax evasion. It's good that there's honest people still out there trying to catch these criminals.
---
Most people I see complaining about rising PLEX prices and sinking Rorqual ticks wear the same fllair as you ... just saying ...
---
Eve is a super common game for playing on laptops due to the low stress, and the fact you can complete 99.9% of gameplay activities without the need for any real computing power.
---
I played eve on a 2012 MacBook with zero problems until late 2017. Good shit.
---
Thank god. I can still 10 box rorqs with my 32bit. 64bit will almost definitely increase the memory usage. That has been the pattern in every single game that has gone from 32bit to 64bit.
---
I specifically remember RMR launching because I was on holidays in Turkey and I had to have the internet cafe download it before I could login. Looking back on it I do miss the old .exe and login screen but honestly, the launcher is a better system nowadays.
---
What irks me the most about CCP is just the tiny little QOL changes they could make to appease us.
---
&gt;Launcher having too much ad space

wonder if theyre just working hard on that FPS thing they want to do. instead of actually working on eve, and dont want to admit it cos then as subscribers we would expect the game free, when it for sure wont be to IRL money eve subs
---
Uhhh they are doing mini fanfests this year round the globe because the Harpa is having renovation work/isn't available. Back to normal Iceland fanfest next year. 
---
Greed is Bad! Greed is Bad! Greed is Bad!
---
Well im with eve from about 13 years and most of this time it was day by day playing or at least tracking news and game development.
---
It's obvious that they cut eve development very much by slow process year by year, it was easy to see on year by year fanfest where there was less new content and ambitious projects in eve, less promo videos, less new content that matters. When we get 2 big expansions per year that was great, it keeps game alive, vibrant, it attracted new and old players, there was new or redone content for months of playing. Now there's not even fanfest(!) 
---
Now CCP goes to EA and Bethesda approach which is "as low effort as possible with as much profits as possible" the whole game industry suffer from that and yet CCP goes that way... At least that approach is finally backstabbing those companies but probably it wont end because of youngsters that buy all that unfinished games with cutted off content just to sell it again. 
---
For me it's the end of that journey with eve, im not excited, i don't see any good will from developers, and i have some honor to not be fu... by that $$$ only matters approach.
---
You will all see, in next years eve will get less and less new content, more and more players will go away. CCP will just try to maintain cash cow as long as it's possible, probably there will be players riot so they will bring some shiny content to extend cash flow (don't be deluded then).
---
Ofcourse i would like eve to live forever but You really believe that they will remove skill injectors? Hire a lot of peoples to bring constant big amount of content and make proper balance team? Invest in eve? Because only that can save that game, well i don't believe that if they can't even make proper working event...
---
That epic skin, tho!
---
Must admit, agree about this sub. My first fanfest was 2017, i would have an amazing time there, meet loads of people, talk to passionate devs and generally have a laugh, go back to my airBnB and check in on Reddit and just see everyone raging about everything at fanfest. Was just like wtf. 
---
Didn’t they, like... just release a MASSIVE expansion and overhaul introducing a completely redefined structure system, NPC sotiyos w/ new AI, and numerous quality of life improvements and game balances? Or am I just imagining that?
---
because in 2019 putting a rorq in goons is safer than incursions for more isk
---
I'll be running in maintenance mode by playing other games until something changes.
---
Legally: how does PLEX work if they end up biting the dust? As I understand it's written as a liability on thier books. 
---
#BringBackROIR
---
And you picked one of the cheap skins too. For some of the capital skins you can buy complete other games :)
---
And the fallout skin costs more than the game itself so that is already broken
---
When I see these posts I cant help but think back to 2007 when I was training perception to 5 and all the 05 players were basically immune to anything you could do.  Then I move ahead a bit to 09 and.... It has not changed much.  The 05 players are still 2 years ahead of me.  I can engage with them too a point but they can always escalate to ships I have yet to get too yet.  This imbalance created a cancerous environment of swollen egos.   This was killing Eve.  Taking out learning skills was not enough. 
---
I know many hate injectors but it solved the greatest problem the game had.  It balanced characters.......  
---
Permaband only travels in Ishtars.
---

Yes that s why it will be better to directly have sp with money : no plex used for skill farm
---
Frank, can you please stop being a baltringue ? 
---
(Capitals are AIDS btw)
---
I’m not sure why but I once had my entire 6 structure industrial complex reffed by them and I don’t even have bad standing with Bloodraiders.
---
That is why i love EvE nowadays, it reminds me of my life.
---
I really like the dev blogs and all the information your get from behind the scenes and all that, but since there's the Twettfleet Slack with a lot of CCP's devs, I get my daily doze of behind the scenes stuff.
---
Isk velocity would decrease, that seems to be the main problem short term
---
Obligatory self promotion.
---
Started eve on a 2010 macbook air. Nothing looked great but it was *playable*
---
This wouldn't be fair for nullsdc player... No!
---
Lets be honest, the 64 bit client has been rolling on the leading edge of the updates page since Fanfest last year.  
---
Not to mention the two time periods are literally only a couple of months apart (Winter to Spring 2019 is effectively February).  
---
Bashing them for the sake of bashing them doesn't help anyone.   
---
If you aren’t dank fraggin’ it on a laptop at the beach while multiboxing 5 rorquals you aren’t doing it right.
---
Do CCP is try to copy paste Star Citizen in the delay of releasing " new " contents ?
---
Funnily enough, before any of this went down, I checked with CCP. They said it's fine to blackmail and extort botters by threatening exposure.
---
Not sure why this NC guy is trying to make a huge deal out of it.
---
Hello, wonderful Capsuleers!
---
Today we’re happy to present another devblog on upcoming changes, with this one focused on a system that absolutely every pilot in New Eden utilizes on a regular basis – the skill training system.
---
CHANGES TO TRAINING YOU SAY?
---
Yep!
---
The dev team have been looking at some of the more complex systems that new players encounter during their first few hours in New Eden, with the objective of simplifying some of the flow and allowing easier access and understanding.
---
In addition to this we’d also like to improve the level of convenience for veteran players wherever we can too, so these changes also have established pilots in mind with the objective of making skill purchasing simpler and more convenient.
---
WHY CHANGE SKILL TRAINING?
---
Training itself will remain the same, with skillpoints accrued over time that are fed into a specific skill to improve specialization in a given field.
---
The change to the system involves how pilots acquire the core skills that they train. We’re calling this new method of obtaining core training “Skills on Demand”.
---
New pilots are often confused by having to use the market to buy a new skill to train. The system is difficult to understand and requiring knowledge of a secondary system – the market – to be able to set up a solid skill plan during the first steps of their new life as a capsuleer.
---
With this change we want to ensure the best of both worlds. We don’t want the need to travel to gather skills posing a barrier to training and we want to ensure that pilots spend less time obtaining skills to train and more time out there enjoying their time in New Eden.
---
This change will give us the best of both worlds, retaining the old functionality of allowing the injection of skills that can be purchased as physical items on the market, while allowing us to improve the user experience and reduce confusion when training core skills.
---
It also allows us to preserve the rarity of some skills that are obtainable only though in game content, such as Precursor skills, for example, which will be unchanged.
---
SO, WHAT’S CHANGING?
---
The largest part of this change is the fact that all core skills will now be purchasable directly from the character sheet for ISK. Rare skills that are not seeded on the market and are only available through the completion of in game content will not be available, but the skill sheet will provide a market link for them.
---
This new system will make sure that the old core mechanics of seeding and injection remain in place – if you don’t want to use skills on demand, then you can continue to pick up skills just the same as you have done for the last sixteen years!
---
Skills that are sold via the character sheet will also have a percentage mark-up in ISK that makes the skill more profitable when trading.
---
MORE CHANGES FOR CONVENIENCE!
---
With skills on demand, hovering over a skill on the character sheet will give you the option to buy the individual skill, or buy and train it, which will place it directly in your skill queue after purchase.
---
1
---
If a skill you’re looking to buy has untrained prerequisite skills, then you’ll be presented with the option to simply buy the skill, or to buy and train the skill plus all its required prerequisite skills too.
---
2
---
All skills that are purchased via the character sheet will be automatically unlocked. There’ll be no delivery of a skill as an item, they’ll just be injected directly into your character sheet to simplify the training process.
---
In addition to these changes, using “Show Info” on an item that has skill requirements will now allow you to purchase skills directly to your character sheet in this way straight from the requirements tab.
---
CHANGES TO SKILL PRICING
---
As part of the rollout of these changes, we’ll also be looking at the base price of all skills.
---
This has never been done before, even though hundreds of new skills have been added to EVE over the course of the last sixteen years.
---
We’ll be taking a pass on the prices of skills to make sure that their cost is consistent, fair and sensible for today’s market.
---
WE WANT YOUR FEEDBACK!
---
These are substantial changes and we’d love to hear your feedback on how they’re going to affect you all.
---
Giving the community early access to changes like this is super important so that we can work with you all to make sure that tweaks like this make sense.
---
We’ll be deploying these changes to the skill training system to the Singularity test server in the next day or so and we’d love as many of you guys as possible to log in and try them out.
---
When you do so, be sure to leave your feedback in the comments thread for this blog.
---
See you in space!
---

---
REEEEEEE... when will the pvp end?????
---
I can't, it's part of who i am! If you look deep inside yourself, right next to your l33t nanofag heart, you'll see you're a baltringue too &lt;3
---
Why not tengu?
---
I can’t tell if this is good or bad... the format is really fucking with me.
---
Whole videogame industry is broken. Companies do not care about customers, but about profit and profit alone. 
---
Simply put, greed is the new black. 
---
Having had a bunch of friends try eve, the way skillbooks are handled is usually a big hurdle. The market interface is intimidating and this will probably help with that. Seems like a pretty good change to me.
---
This saddens me. We saw some Wingspan Delivery vehicles in Brave space a couple of months ago and they didn't even deliver our Torpedoes. They just asked us to give them some RLM's. I mean. We were happy to oblige but the quality of service from Wingspan has really gone downhill. First that... Now this! If I were a shareholder I'd definitely be voting on new leadership. 
---
Well, as long as they can get away with it they will try even worse things. This will go on until one of those schemes explode into someones face.
---
Wow I must admit I inferred something very different when I read the title of the devblog, but this actually sounds like a no-brainer and should hopefully stop noobs being fleeced on flipped skill books in starter stations.
---
But... think of the alphas!
---
Whoa whoa whoa there bud - I’m still wiping the blood from my eyes after reading that haiku or whatever the fuck it is you just posted with all the little fucking arrows pointing right like it’s directed me towards an eloquently worded thought only to be met with the grim fate of reading calibri formatted fecal characters.
---
CCP can completely reverse all of their problems if they can find a way to monetize bitter vet posts on reddit. They would be rolling in dough. 
---
Implying it was never complete shit
---
https://www.eveonline.com/articles/patch-notes
---
And people in this subreddit wonder why their ideas are never implemented.
---
If it creates a huge issue for a large part of the player base (especially those who you do not even want to target with the change), it is probably not as good of an idea as you think. Killing the mosquito might just not be worth it if you bomb the whole fucking house to do so.
---
Stop being mean to Sort. 
---
hire me, pay me to write, and then charge everyone per post. I've got more where this bitterness came from.

---
and due to the "feel bad" ... the last delivery of torpedoes I got, they where all broken (exploded) as they reached me. 
---
Either it was his bots or nobody falls for his stupid Jita Local scams ... XD
---
I’m still trying to represent all of the players, but that is difficult when there is no consensus on what folks want, and the community jumps from issue to issue like a slap happy rabbit. It is way worse now than it has been in a long time. 
---
I do all my best shitposting from my phone
---
I thought we are finally getting somewhere last year with that whole EA/lootbox affair. But a few weeks went by, loud noises placated (by ungodly ammount of money made from child gambling i suppose), no charges raised against anyone (as far as i know) and now we have lootboxes everywhere. 
---
Literally can't wait for them to arive in EvE.
---
Ccp realized they kept the wrong player base and drove off the one that made this game great. This is them pivoting 
---
modern problems require modern solutions :smart:

Well there are alot of goons so makes sense you see their flair. And I'm okay with whatever happens. I play the game to have fun, when I stop having fun I stop playing the game.
---
Wouldn't a higher Plex cost make you happy if this were true? More isk for your dollar.. I don't understand what you are complaining about.
---
You should have a crossover with a rope (ingame)
---
You think you know what a game in maintenance mode looks like, **you don't**. Look at Guild Wars 2, Look at Titanfall 1-2, Look at Max Payne 3 Multiplayer. 
---
Shit man look at Any Blizzard title from the past 10 years. Nobody has tried to re-invent the wheel or iterate in a risky way like CCP has. CCP might fuck up routinely but at least they actually try. Nothing ventured nothing gained, most MMOs are in a stagnant lockstep release cycle that nobody gives a shit about. 
---
In the next 2 years WoW, Guild Wars, etc will be like Tera, Aion and Archeage are today. This isn't a problem unique to eve online, this is a larger problem with the way gaming as an industry works. CCP to their credit are trying to change things. 
---
For those concerned about the potential issues with it removing trading opportunities;
---
\&gt; Skills that are sold via the character sheet will also have a percentage mark-up in ISK that makes the skill more profitable when trading. 
---
This should just put a ceiling on the margin that can be charged, which should be beneficial to new players as well as older ones.
---
I was on the edge of losing my shit because of the title, lol.
---
Good changes.
---
They'd have enough material from Seagull's [thrice-presented development slide](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bZxKMptsUnI/VfY5bujzWOI/AAAAAAAAELY/CZ5BP_fcE6E/s1600/PBSG%2BFF2014%2BSS%2B1.jpg) for a couple of expansions all by itself.
---
For CCAbyss, cash in the bank. For players: lulz.
---
Hilmar, you have no balls. Sell them for PLEX, not ISK.
---
seems like a good change, why should i have to go to the effort of travelling to buy skillbooks when i want to make another rorqual alt?
---
If you can get them by playing the game, who gives a fuck? 
---
Well belgium decided to forbid loot boxes. But if other countries don't do something about it they will continue. There seem to be enough people that buy those boxes so that they make profigt off them. As soon as they don't make profit with those they will stop. But not before that
---
~~Maybe this will be~~ This will definitely be an unpopular opinion but it comes from a place of love for EVE: I'm ready for a new EVE game. 
---
I've always wanted a proper space sim set in the EVE universe. I'm thinking EVE Valkyrie + open world? Probably couldn't be online because the server ticks would have to be too fast but I'd be ok with that. Maybe something with more instancing (booooo hiss!) like Elite Dangerous?
---
I dunno, I'm just an old man who doesn't have enough time for internet spaceships anymore looking for a way to return to New Eden.
---
Yeaaaahh.. Just copied the Dev blog name. Blame CCP :D
---
/u/ccp_falcon           
---
Those changes are great - just a hint - when someone **BUY** a skill just include in this those 250-500 sp to get someone to LVL 1.       
---
If we are talking about newbies - skilling up from lvl 1 will be more consistent than "buying" a skill just to wait 5min to train it. 
---
in b4 titan and other capital skillbooks increase in price tenfold.
---
also this sounds like a bigger isk sink, so yay.
---
why would you use the new reddit?
---
who the fuck uses Opera by choice?
---
/me gets the gag.
---
Its venture and vulture iirc. The subreddit asked for this in July and mods finally went for it
---
&gt;We’ll be taking a pass on the prices of skills to make sure that their cost is consistent, fair and sensible for today’s market.
---
Oh god all skills are going to cost a fortune now! 
---
Ccp being lazy/promising on stuff they can't deliver?? I will not stand for this type of slander!!
---
thats a danque naglfar fit, how many booster cycles do you get off before you cap yourself out?
---
I generally agree, Eve is in maintenance mode.  It's the lifecycle of a product and Eve has lived well beyond the expectations of pretty much everyone including CCP.  Being in maintenance isn't "eve is dying" it just means it's going to get less attention, less development and expected to make as much revenue --- ie., expect more skins and in game purchase options.   CCP's challenge is to make another Eve, a better Eve and one that will last just as long.  Their track record to date is abysmal.  They have the formula to do it --- it's called Eve Online, but they're too busy trying to be like other gaming companies and recreating lack luster FPS shooters to realize what they are good at and to duplicate and expand Eve into a new direction using the same tried and true formula.  smh.

Oh boi, I thought this was proposing being able to literally buy fully completed skills for ISK. That'll teach me to read these Devblogs properly. Good job CCP
---
dumbing the game down further lol
---
Predicted? It was on hoboleaks.
---
Shhh… you're disrupting the circlejerk.

because ccp doesnt need to waste more dev time on useless shit

Why sell an asset once when you can sell it 143 times?
---
So you can skill faster and slower ... and if you are skilling slower , such thing can motivate you to inject some sp to catchup with lost skillpoints. 
---
I don't wonder why most of the ideas are not implemented. Big ideas big changes thrown out there for feedback and discussion is better than putting out a inconsequential strategy that does nothing and bores everyone. 
---
Decrease mining drone yield by 12.6 % and boost pirate haven spawn rates in relation to mining index and per hour jump gate activity. Might change things more gradually and cause people to ... not be scared, but it does the same thing. 
---
[big think](https://imgs.ovh/i/uugs2.png)
---
Clearly the CSM has been conditioned by CCP.
---
I agree with most of the bitching on here, but as a wormholer, the agency can be very useful HINT HINT.
---
Ah they've invented Amazon Kindle
---
No time for updates because fanfest world tour. What do you people want? Fanfest world tour or updates? Can't have both, they're contradictory.
---
&gt;Seventh, CPU &amp; Power management skills have been removed from the game and compensated with increased values.
---
Wut?
---
...are you bragging on the expansions CCP deployed in November and December of 2017? 14 months ago?
---
&gt; Its not dead yet, but it might as well be.
---
There are a lot of people who still like Eve. People into the nullblob drama still enjoy the game. They get their occasional client-crashing tidi-cancer super-blob over some inconsequential structure. Kotaku does some reddit copy/paste news article quoting the invaluable insights of one progodlegend that they can share with their friends and say "I WAS THERE!". In between they can watch their wallet balance go up as the alliance buyback program purchases all the ore they've been mining in their 5 rorqs this week.
---
Unfortunately I don't think there's any going back from here, so you're right. The things that made Eve great to many won't be back. I saw the usual "mining is safer and more profitable in nullsec" advice repeated yet again somewhere in the past few days. There's no risk/reward tradeoff. The "right" way to play Eve now is to just find a nullbob hide deep in their space and grind isk until the next maxxxbois CTA.
---
Before I hear "but rorqs die so everything is fine": Yes, you _can_ still focus on some of the more risky types of gameplay and try to impose some risk on those snuggling safe in their pockets. But, when changes to the game have been slowly eliminating/discouraging that type of gameplay, you can see why it's dead for some people.
---
dude, no.
---
Mabinogi went crossover insane. and it has not helped at all. just made gancha boxes the only way to get worthwhile equipment.   same company as maplestory
---
so no.
---
Best log in screen burnt into 3 of my old crts
---
Lmao, ah yeah I forgot they need that time to just add another feature to abandon and leave in game.
---
Again.
---
Need that injector sink to come from somewhere!
---
I remember when CCP got sick of our shit and just started releasing things on schedule instead of when they were ready.
---
Those were dark times. 
---
Citadels were introduced in 2016 if I recall
---
NPC Sotiyo's are over year old content which only affect
---
* Guristas
---
* Blood Raiders
---
Those are also content which most likely 98% of the EVE playerbase won't ever even see. They are a cool thing in theory, but in practice, in terms of combatting them &amp; what they drop, a enormous majority won't have anything to do with them.
---
QoL Improvements: Small stuff, those are nice but to be fair, not exactly on par with say, introducing wormholes. Bringing an entirely new line of ships, say, a subcap that had massive damage against capitals but was almost defensless against subcaps.
---
Also, for game balances? In case you're out of the loop, CCP have been ridiculed just now for pushing basically all of "Winter" content to Spring (Spoilers. Its coming in June/July most likely), one key feature which was advertised, is more balance. They've done exactly 0 of that during the winter, so, unfortunately you're just imagning that.
---
Wish it weren't so. I do love EVE but CCP aren't exactly what we'd call the best devs, they do have some good sides but if I had to guess its an upper management which is in actuality giving us gray hairs.
---
Look at the price of exoplanet skins
---
Straight up? This "bug" started when they made roaming gangs exist in the sotiyo system. They just attack everything they see and CCP decided to leave it. 
---
Obligatory: https://youtu.be/OCsMKypvmB0
---
What’s the typical player’s progression in pvp ships (besides injecting into a titan)? It doesn’t seem like that many skills carry over from a frigate to a cruiser or cruiser to a battleship. Do people just stick with one class of ship from the start?
---
Wormholes don't do real PVP... Only run away when hammer comes.
---
Less than 0.5% of our players, according to the metrics we have.
---
It is to plan ahead and select a certain path for your character. What I could do with is a purchasable remap on NES though.
---
It is people like me that have no fun in static rinse&amp;repeat PvE or fapping to wallet counts. As CCP kicked this playstyle in the balls very hard since 2015. a lot of people like me stopped investing more cash than needed for the sub since then as we did not support this. CCP didn't care and that lead to current PLEX market developement. I iI was an egoistic asshole only looking at myself I could say fine, mire ISK for my bucks, but as a caring player for 12 years I see where this would lead too (Serenity 20 Bil ISK for 500 PLEX but the economy totally fucked up and peoüple fleeing the server)
---
Good. Maybe then things will naturally balance out and CCP will see how many accounts they have are just alts bouyed with ISK that is way to easy to generate from nothing.
---
I mentioned that I was planning an article with that name a few times over the summit talking about the past 3 years on the CSM, and comparing where we were at the beginning to where we are now, and the things I feel people have forgotten on that path - The T3 rework (both D and C), Upwell 2.0 (Low Power), the end of Ishtars/Tengus Online, Machariels Online, Void Bombs, Ghost Training, Default Overview changes, Rorq Ancil nerfs, War dec changes, Alpha ships rebalance, etc.
---
&gt;It is to plan ahead and select a certain path for your character.
---
You do that with skills themselves. Attributes create a needless dated interaction.
---
&gt;&gt;Skills that are sold via the character sheet will also have a percentage mark-up in ISK that makes the skill more profitable when trading.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;This should just put a ceiling on the margin that can be charged, which should be beneficial to new players as well as older ones.
---
Hahaha, as if players will buy skills from players/the market anymore just to save a few million isk in the age of extractors, supers, and rorquals.
---
Extracting is using extractors, extractors you get from plex, plex can be only bought from CCP - thus you are paying to leave the game.      
---
WTF         
---
So we should expect sweeping enhancements to HS and LS?
---
Great change that removes something annoying and replaces it with something sensible. 
---
Injectors in no way 'balanced characters'.
---
In your own example, you've been playing on/off for 12 years so you should be beyond the point where injecting is worth it.
---
How are you classifying 'balancing characters'?
---
A newb opening their wallet 3 weeks into the game to buy plex to inject into a carrier isn't 'balancing a character' - it's rushing them and it leads to stupid lossmails where they either open their wallet again or quit the game. 
---
It also allowed the rich to get richer via injecting rorqual alts, etc.
---
&gt;all the 05 players were basically immune to anything you could do.
---
Are we playing the same game here? I'm an 05 character and I got jammed by a griffin last night. Yes, an 05 character that in subscription costs alone would be around ~2,500 euro got jammed by a one day old (most likely alt) in a ship worth less than 1m.
---
&gt;fuck yeah, I’m elite
---
Use ghsol galactic hauling services , cheaper than the regular guys and faster. They deliver from jita to low sec. 
---
damn it, you got me here :D +1
---
Having to find an NPC station to buy amarr frigate has forever been a shit mechanic. Though I myself would just have given new clones a larger basket of skills untrained but injected.
---
Give all C6-C6s an additional null static
---
All major wormhole groups move to the C6-C6/Null wormholes
---
Roll C6 static until it connects to another group, repeat until all groups are connected through their C6 chains
---
All groups then roll their null statics for some target
---
When any one group connects, all groups travel the C6 chain to the correct wormhole and jump out the null connection
---
Pewpewskadoo
---
On symmetry: Classes 1, 2 and 3 all have a kspace static, whereas classes 4, 5 and 6 never have a kspace static.
---
On a serious note, when was the last time CCP made any structural changes to j-space mechanics? Highclass connection mass changes with the FAX introduction?
---
Scam ur corp first to buy the extractors off market.
---
This game is in gacha mode. The skill system is passive and instead of creating a dynamic EXP or Mastery system or just plain nixing the system and relying on market rarity and production costliness to maintain capital and supercapital rarity, CCP has intrinsically tied their financial system to the passive skill system. By making PLEX the only way to both acquire skill extractors and 30 days of subscription, CCP Games has made the only *consistent* method of pilot skill progression inseparable from their microtransaction system.
---
Because there is incentive to inject your character straight into anything you want and using the leftover ISK to buy the hull, there isn't a possibility of instilling a sense of value in our ships. Everything can be purchased and injected into. This isn't a Goon-instigated problem or a pubbie-instigated problem. It benefits CCP Games to make you think the Imperium is abusing the Rorqual balance issue when any common-sense gamer would get a Rorqual and print ISK. CCP Games has designed this PLEX Ouroboros and is going to eat itself alive chasing profits in a closed system that is perpetuated by players being tempted by microtransactions.
---
This game should've never left subscription only. The passive skill system should've been scrapped or revamped to allow in-game acceleration, not instant progression via credit card. This game is fucked beyond measure.
---
People literally do that right now in Jita rather than fly 4 jumps to the nearest skill-spawning points. You can go and check the market depth there, it's surprisingly high. Not everyone plays EVE with a credit card in one hand and an injector in the other, so these sorts of things still matter to newer players.
---
Awesome, let's streamline the already problematic alpha/alt abuse. Thanks ccp another useless change that literally nobody asked for!
---
How many years has this taken from concept to now? Seems like 5 years at least.
---
I see someone got their freighter blown up. When you quit eve, can I have your stuff?
---
But think avout the newbros. How could they possibly handle using the ingame market? 
---
Obligatory “but muh gate to stain!”
---
Sounds kinky, fuck if i know what kpop is iam stuck with Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin, Fats Waller and such.
---
Says silently....links to update from CCP where first item is 64bit client.
---
I'd like to know the point of typing 2k19 vs 2019
---
I'd read it for what it's worth, sounds very interesting!
---
Lmao.
---
There is really no point in either.
---
Ive tried to get my best friend to play eve like 3 times in the last 5 years and little shit like this led him to repeatedly tell me to fuck off. 
---
These mindless mongos rather cry and complain about shit than actually take the time to realize the incredible positive forward movements CCP has made over the last years and even done so with smaller staff.
---
Fake:  warping siege rorq, getting Concorded without firing on freighter.  
---
Gay:  goons. 
---
Come to terms = stop giving them money???
---
Isn't what you're asking exactly the same? Abandoning attributes. 
---
What I want to know is why people still use the 2kXX format for dates when the original 2k instead of 2000 was for lazy people that did not want to type 4 characters. 2k19 is the same amount of typing as 2019, or is your 0 key broken?
---
&gt;Skills that are sold via the character sheet will also have a percentage mark-up in ISK
---
Another bite taken from the player market, via an isk cap. If i ubderstand corectly. 
---
none of these are "expansions" other than citadels
---
Surely you can see that the triage mechanic necessitates PANIC, though.
---
Otherwise Rorqual usage anywhere by anyone would be pretty much nil after the first time a decent bomber gang bridged around holocausting half a region of them with essentially no counterplay, then it'd be back to "abloobloobloo we can't tackle things because they rat aligned CCP please force them to feed us" and the other various flavors of entitlement in about 5 minutes
---
And said holocaust would probably occur midway through the day the patch removing PANIC was released
---
I agree PANIC is retarded but so is tying the hull's effectiveness in the intended role to a triage mode, and because the effectiveness is tied to a triage mode the only way for the hull to be viable in the intended role is PANIC or something similar
---
Wonder what is so hard about chat. If a 15 year old gaming company can't figure out chat, what hope do we have?
---
That is an excellent point you got there. 
---
Yes I’m sure going to miss the thrilling gameplay around needing a skill and having to travel X jumps to get it, and then going back feeling like I just completely wasted my time.
---
CCP might be more than a little late in doing this, but it might be smart to focus on why people who pick up the game stop playing it.
---
the apocalypse is truly upon us. the day that an old bob member agrees with a goddamn goon has transpired...
---
We have an electric car orbiting the sun. Please tell me how hard it is for someone to code a 64bit client.
---
it also created the biggest problem in the game lmao
---
Didn't they nix fanfest too in favor of that "hey let's make a player host it at their house lmfao" plan
---
I’d never move in, but a cheap ratting ship, a scanner and a salvaged and you’re all set
---
They're about to do a bunch of conferences, where they usually make announcements. I'd at least wait until then. 
---
General feeling was good.
---
What's Taco?
---
Thanks for explaining why people still ironically say 2k19.
---
Gone will be the days smartbombed interceptors with titan &amp; capital ships in cargohold.

---
2k19 is shorter to type than 200019 duh
---
Activity tracker isn't \_just\_ for us. it's also an expansion to the logging which allows CCP to data mine our in game activity, looking for trends and spikes. Metrics are good.
---
It's already a feature that hasn't seen any significant changes in nearly a decade, which saw part of it's system axed. What's left, as I said before, is needless and clunky gameplay.
---
I’m pretty sure new jump gates and cyno beacons were released like last month. 
---
A ton of people are enjoying and participating in the new precursor stuff which added a relatively balanced and whole new alternative to typical ship / module / strategy trees.
---
Sotiyo rats are everywhere not just at Sotiyo.
---
QoL improvements are god send for those of us who actually play EVE vs. typing up whine posts about how CCP isn’t listening to every snowflake about their dumb ideas.
---
Yes, they are understaffed and the workload may exceed the hands available to handle said tasks. Outside of that CCP has one of the best dev teams, and most interactive dev teams, of any game I have ever experienced. They may try out different directions and ideas in the pursuit of profits and new revenue streams but they are a fucking company and their sole existence is dependent on the bottom line - most people here seem to completely lack any capability to understand how companies work. Eventually, given time, they make changes and mold shit towards the player base’s needs and wants.
---
Nope. Rare skillbooks still need to brought from the market and injected normally. Pretty sure they can't be injected remotely?
---
They haven't tried shit in Eve for the past 6-8 years.
---
I mean they have released different structures almost every quarter I don’t know how you are attempting to make an argument here?
---
renmeber the jukebox? yea i kinda do and nobody knows why its removed 
---
But poeple dont think it do.
---
&gt;People literally do that right now in Jita rather than fly 4 jumps to the nearest skill-spawning points. You can go and check the market depth there, it's surprisingly high.
---
You have it backwards. People are currently buying skills from players in Jita, paying more than from the NPCs, for the *convenience* of not having to jump 4 jumps. When the NPC costs include this undefined ceiling margin, player books will be cheaper. However, I expect most people will pay the NPCs more for the convenience of not having to open the market and buy a book they might have to fly jumps to go get. Why fly to Jita when I can inject the skill book now, in my mission hub?
---
&gt; Not everyone plays EVE with a credit card in one hand and an injector in the other, so these sorts of things still matter to newer players.
---
Sure. When I was an isk starved newbean I counted every cent and only bought skills from NPCs due to the cost. Those people might still buy from players. Anyone with any significant income (where I term significant &gt;= 200m/month) is not going to care about a little lost isk here and there when it saves them N jumps.
---
rip jukebox bro. i loved that thing.
---
Fuck, CAN we go back to RMR? That was when I started EVE. Fuck, Trinity would be FINE. Incarna would be fine. Apocrypha is where they ended official Linux support, so clearly where shit went down hill. 
---
I legitimately think CCP listened to the CSM way too god damn much.
---
Maplestory? Srsly? I had to google that shit.
---
And i did not like what is saw. :D
---
I mean your argument honestly is more than just completely refuted
---
It's impaled on the throbbing, veiny member of refutation if you bother to go back literally practically amount of time and compare how many Rorquals and other capitals are dying now to how many were dying under previous mechanics
---
Capital losses of any kind used to be fairly noteworthy and with reasonable play practically impossible to catch as they warped to range, aligned and/or pulsed above jump cap so they were able to jump to an emergency exit
---
The simple fact of the matter is that CCP gave everyone the feed they wanted by making Rorquals self-tackle, more capitals are dying now than ever in the history of the game, and yall entitled fucks are still begging for a lower bar like I don't even
---
Well I wouldn't mind if there were no attributes at all. At least I could train whatever the fuck I need at the time instead of going by my year-long plan and barely deviate from it at all.  
---
But they're probably not gonna do that. So at least the NES could help me out - but knowing CCP they'd probably ask for something ridiculous like 50 quid, which I wouldn't buy even if I was completely smashed.
---
&gt;Citadels are just pos replacements.
---
Sorry but there's no way you genuinely believe it's that straight forward. There was a lot changed with introducing citadels, ACLs, new timer system, new models and anchoring mechanics, tethering - all that shit.
---
Further, it's not 'just a meme' that Eve is spaghetti coded around POS's. This is something that's been joked about for literally over a decade. Whenever there was *any* changes made to POS mechanics, random stuff used to break in the game. Back in the day before expansion day you literally, had to set a long skillqueue because the servers would either not come online for a few days, or come online, then rollback for a hotfix (sometimes several tiems) because something was changed with POS's.
---
The day CCP actually fully do remove POS's from the game I'll applaud them, because it's not a simple task. I don't think Citadels are the direct replacement for them (in their current iteration), but that's the way EVE is being developed so more power to it.
---
or the ingame browser / ingame billboards   
---
heck even the bountyboards where nice, i lived in HS back then (did so till 2017) and seeing someone have a 30b bounty was the stuff of legends, now i see people shrug off supers being welped as "meh another one i guess, already replaced" 
---
Cthulhu fhtagn!
---
oh god no i thought you were trolling :D
---
Here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2J8IoK5iqw
---
Sometimes let it run in a endless loop when doing stuff in my house ...
---
Don't get me wrong, CCP isn't infallible and they've put their foot in some pretty obvious holes over the year, but they are slowly marching towards things the community desperately wanted them to do 2 years ago - The pain of that coming at the expense of Jesus features is really showing though, and it's a shame to see the community argue against what it so desperately wanted a few years ago, work on the back end of EVE to give it a long standing technical future. 
---
Why pay to quit?
---
it's technically a white text(or black text if you are a pleb and not use night more) tho...
---
Let's be honest, traveling to pick up skills was never a barrier to create rorqual alts.
---
Pls
---
ANet just lost 1/4 of their staff - 100 people - including several 'Big Name' people there since GW1. They were pulling people off their core product, and developing (but never releasing) other games (1 mobile, bleh). NCSoft put their foot down, and a buncha peeps 'took early retirement' / were given a cardboard box and told to clean out their desks. 
---
I believe that's 'Rare as in drops', rather than just 'expensive'.
---
However, when there's a percentage increase in cost for using it, I can see some skill books still being moved. Especially the expensive ones.
---
Nah they'd release with vip packs where you can grab yourself two remaps, a few common rarity skins three extractors and a chance to roll a rare skin for $75.
---
Leave your remap even then. Ez. Don't like the comparative result vs players managing their attributes and learning implants? Well, there you have it.
---
i am happy that you are aware of this ingame bug. 
---
sure, its nowhere near a 1:1 transaction but in terms of gameplay there isn't a HUGE new change when citadels are meant to replace POSes
---
yeah there's new tethering, ACLs, models and timers, but most of those are just better/modern versions of the POS bubbles and mechanics
---
as such I don't count the baseline citadels as "expansions" as much as they are modernizing and older, core part of the game
---
did you guys thought about wormholes when it was discussed in the csm (i suppose the whole thing was on the agenda). I know WHs dont matter in the grand sheme but now ppl can store alpha toons and instant mass inject them to usefull stuff like rolling caps, defense doctrine etc in case of an eviction attempt. This kinda takes away from the point that one would try to pod toons of the other side ---&gt; w/o the need of any foresight or planning. I know its not a super viable tactic but it can be option
---
Rose tinted glasses really 
---
It's nice to think about but I'd never want to go back. EVE is what it is today because it's always changing. If I had any choice at all I'd instead choose to restart EVE in it's current iteration with 0SP, 0ISK instead.
---
Plus back then the game was ugly as sin, big fights were blackscreen for hours and hours and the game itself wasn't really as good. Exploits were far, far more common too.
---
through\*
---
&gt; incredible positive forward movements
---
You mean the close to 40% decline in logged in Accounts since 2013 ?
---
ahhhh
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz9AQ_jLqVU
---
used to be a big fucking deal. i agree with you that its kind of sad now.
---
Ah, right, people who have a negative opinion of a mechanic should just not use that mechanic they disagree with, because reasons.
---
Ensures you've nothing to come back to. If you truly want to quit eve, (IMO) you need to salt the earth so it's not worth it.
---
Just use the eraser and make the 32-bit logo and 64 and bam you're a 64-bit client.
---
NEXT TASK
---
Bad title CCP but good change, spooky as hell until you actually read it.
---
Yes
---
Eve is a game of consequence not oops I fucked up time to hit the reset button and start over.
---
14 months old, NPC Sotiyos are a laugh ... still broken aggro mechanics make it exploitable with 2-3 chars. And I am sure a lot of people cherissh the QoL-Improvements of the cahat system ...
---
like just delete characters, or do some RMT to have them perma banned. 
---
&gt;I’m still trying to represent all of the players
---
Your never going to because again all players don't have a uniform vision for the game, the best you end up doing is representing a majority. 
---
&gt; but that is difficult when there is no consensus on what folks want
---
Given there is no uniform vision how the game should look and priority often comes down to i'm facing this issue ( for example i don't give a fuck about 64 bit client, memory issue's don't impact me anyway ). 
---
&gt;  the community jumps from issue to issue like a slap happy rabbit
---
It's almost as the people that have there game play impacted most tend to be loudest on a particular issue. 
---
&gt;  It is way worse now than it has been in a long time.
---
It's almost as if people don't have any faith there representatives are doing a good job, so without any place to complain about the state of the game other then Reddit people use the tools they have rather then the tools they want.
---
Same, the title of the Devblog induced me to think the worst and I was getting ready to lose my shit and finally win EVE... but no, crappy title but pretty logic thing to do that will make life easier for new players and veterans alike.
---
:flex: 
---
True, and to that I'd say it's a good thing. 
---
Is it really a bad thing that we forego an expansion or two to have super old parts of the game updated and removed?
---
I like POS's tbh, I still think they can serve a purpose but I won't shed a tear for them when they're gone.
---
\*cringe\*
---
All of your support missile, gunnery, and drone skills are going to transfer over, as well as any engineering and defensive skills. Literally the only things that don't transfer is the spaceship command and sized weapon skills (medium hybrid turret/large hybrid turret or HAM/Torp) and in missiles rapid lights and lights use the same skills.
---
Going to buy you some ISK off ebay and send it to your character, then report you.
---
BRB.
---
[kpop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7mPqycQ0tQ)
---
Yeah, but they still probably took a huge amount of work, therefore they were expansion levels of content
---
Unzips.
---
NP please send it to StainGuy. 
---
Silly change. Just ate up dev time. If you thought new players might be troubled in the beginning just add more skills as already injected. Work needed for such a change would have been 5 min. How long did this one take?
---
They have no reason to exist, and haven't had one for quite some time.
---
P.S. Anyone arguing that this would destroy the LP market because training implants is retarded and should seriously question it's thinking capabilities if not able to realize the simple solution to that.
---
why do you stare at people?
---
You are right, with all the money from that posts they could stop fucking up the games economy with RMT schemes fueling their sub numbers ....
---
uh how low can you go
---
I cannot express how bad this idea is.
---
A reset isn't going to give you the level playing field you think it will.
---
You made me pretty butt devastated when i forgot that you cant activate preheated scram while repairing launchers and got dumpstered
---
Good job!

If he's so hell-bent on shield tanking the bloody Nyxes, why doesn't he just get a Hel to have a proper tank along with dps... But looking at this dumbfuckery he'd probably just use all the mids for Drone Navs and Tracking Comps anyways.

The only way to transport caps around is to find a c5 or c6 that connects to null and then once inside that c5 or c6, finding a low sec with very large mass limits. When the whole Rage thing was going on I moved a carrier through a scary wormhole people c5. Just be warned trying to do this will most likely end in you dying. Only two reasons exist why i was able to do this, 1. Rage was happening and most people were rage rolling static connections to get in to whore/help 2. It could have been a bear hole but I wasn't sticking around to find out.
---
You probably don't fix your own car and order all the little parts yourself either or you have sites where you find everything in one place so no need to google.
---
There isn't.
---
All attributes should be normalised and remaps should be removed.
---
Cmv.
---
It's not necessarily a bad thing, but the most recent major expansion I can think of is Aegis
---
Citadel/Lifeblood are citadel passes which can be counted based on your own definitions, imo they don't add a huge amount of new gameplay
---
Ascension was citadels + alphas
---
Other than that, the only thing I can think of is Abyssal changes, which was decent content but not hugely impactful either other than introducing leshark
---
idk, it just doesn't feel like there's a *huge* amount of change, and with no decent roadmap it doesn't look like there will be in the future either
---
why not RMT'out ? Its the best Solution.
---
Unsub
---
Got baited by that title lol. This seems like a very good change, helps out newbros. 
---
You mean they don't amass thousands of retards, so the total IQ of their fleet barely reaches above 100? Yes, you are right.
---
Another post that, as a newbro, gives the appearance that there is nothing to look forward to in EVE, despite me having fun every time I log in.
---
&lt;Shrug&gt;
---
Maybe more the fact that you didn't bother with any look at the actual interactions with attributes in the game. I merely offered a solution in line with your attitude.
---
Fuck yeah, we're elite!
---
Do you have any idea who you're mansplaining at or do you just like to huff your own farts
---
"Were making a new FPS zombie shooter/minecraft clone!"
---
What a glorious cluster fuck it would be.
---
I am not quitting the /r/eve so don't ask me if this is best solution. 
---
It can still be the case, depending on the margin. The more convenient the solution, the more it should cost.
---
For example:    
---
NPC-seeded Market base price : 1,000,000 ISK     
---
Character sheet price : 2,000,000 ISK
---
People can still sell/buy for 1,500,00 ISK in Jita and sparing themselves the travel cost to get it 4 jumps away from NPC-seeded market. But if they're 5 jumps away from Jita, and 9 from a station selling the skill, they can buy the skill for double the base market value.
---
If you want to kill it for good, sure. :D

Depends what's broke, in fairness.

Last time my car needed fixing it cost 75% of what I paid for it, and the list of parts filled 2 sides of A4.
---
Thank fuck for insurance.
---
For the Sega Saturn
---
hey! sometimes my 2006 alt flys a griffin.
---
This is a good change.
---
I'd certainly like team little things to take a pass at the character sheet UI. I'm still a believer that the previous style was better, but if we're stuck with this one, at least let us have easy access to things like one-click access to "Train X to level IV" and have it automatically queue up all the skills required to train it.
---
I don't know about others, but when I'm spam clicking on skills to stack them  up, the character sheet lags like an absolute bastard. 
---
Some limits on this would be nice. Don’t include  anything capital sized. Also, since weapon specialization skills are  faction based and not available in school stations I assume these will  still need to be bought from the market? For these something like:  “Available on the market starting at xxxx isk in this region or from npc  sell orders in \[Faction\] space.”
---
Also, do something like Amazon does it: List the price for direct  inject and show a price available from market sellers in the same  region. Something like “Available for 1000 isk from 3 sellers…” You  could deliberately exclude npc sell orders in that.
---
&gt;CCP doesn't communicate with us nearly as often or to the depth that they used to
---
Of course its easy to "communicate" when most issues are trivial. This is no longer the case. Bots and injectors are killing the game. But CCP is too stupid to fix because the former requires work to automate the bannings, and the latter, which is a huge balance issue, is directly tied to the revenue of the company (this might actually be the dumbest idea in the history of gaming).
---
&gt;CCP Falcon doesn't really give a shit to actually own up to communicating about problems for months at a time (See: chat/local bullshit).
---
Hes irrelevant. You need at least a game designer or senior management or nothing gets done. CSM is useless.
---
**Eve isnt in maintenance mode, its on life support!**
---
I didnt include that ability because extractors are (usually) only created by using PLEX to redeem for extractors in the new eden store. People don't buy PLEX, redeem it for extractors, then sell those extractors to buy orders. The only time people really sell extractors to buy orders is during galaxy pack sales, but its still usually significantly cheaper to use 1120 PLEX to buy extractors in the new eden store. I just didnt really think that anyone would choose the less cost effective option so I didnt include the functionality in the sheet. If theres a strong desire for it, I can add it easily enough.
---
Come on tin. You don't have enough alphas that you could remote inject cap skills, then shove injectors up their ass. 
---
At present prices that's what, 7m sp when injectors are almost a bill, so more or less 14b+skillbook cost for a rolling carrier? 
---
I've never lost an eviction because they found a rolling carrier they forgot about. If they inject a good carrier, say 12m sp because fuck jump skills, that's now mid 20's
---
I don't think many corps could just shit out more carrier pilots for home defence. Or defence doctrine, hacs aren't gonna be cheaper.
---
Now, yacht and rolling battleship pilots? Maybe. Yacht pilots especially are just cloaking 4 and align skills, so that's viable to be injecting. Battleships, at a stretch. The rest won't be an issue.
---
Their interactions are not all that deep, we're not talking rocket science. 
---
As I said before, it's a dated system. An unnecessary dated system. Expressing my distaste with that system does not mean I will not use it to my advantage.
---
qq binch
---
g4y
---
Good. Players have too much isk. We need more isk sinks. We don't have many big ones. 
---
Thanks. I taught myself how to do all of this just so I could create a spreadsheet that filled my needs. It took a few years but I eventually got the requisite skills. And yup its a bit of a crapshoot at the moment with regard to profitability for brain farmers.
---
sad but to be expected. still think we gotta wait till end of year tho
---
WTF I love ccp now! Since you're balancing skillbook prices, can you nerf titan skillbooks? They're over 10% the total cost of the hull! It's ridiculous! (😏) 
---
It's hard to pod out a titan pilot, in the days of keepstars, especially when you remember that the titan pilot doesn't have titan injected. 
---
WTM is still around and run daily. I believe TDF also still runs an armor fleet. The waitlists are only bad in the situation where the last incursion was in a 0.6 or 0.5 (gankers heaven) and then the new one is in a higher security and the influence is all the way down. You'll get hour and half waitlists easy. Other than that situation I've never waited longer than 15 mins. However, that zamiel guy is sadly correct. Putting a rorq in goons means if you put a cyno on it, it gets a 15 titan backup easily. It is unreal the amount of supers that the TAPI-Imperium can field. Its kinda funny that people make chinese server comparisons, there is already a gigantic blue donut that bots heavily.
---
My actually is, okay? And i am poor, so stop shaming me!
---
Well, yeah... 
---
If you haven't done something for CCP lately they disable your omega status.
---
How long players asked for this?       
---
&gt;roll c6's until connect
---
&gt;kill nullsec
---
why not just live together. And if you think lmao, roll 6-6's for pvp you're insane. The blueballs will be real. We've done this, and we went back to c5 space. 
---
Good lord, the standard overwiev is really THE pain in the ass. Took me 3 weeks to unfuck it at least a little bit!
---
Then i joined nullsec corp and they forced me to install a proper Overview. 
---
Good god i am glad they did!!!
---
carrier was merely an example and i also stated its not super viable but an option now
---
CCP what the..... Oh thank you. 
---
The thing people seem to forget is it was like this before - we shot the monument for a reason, you know? There was a couple of good, albeit messy years after launch and a couple of good years post Jita riots but this really is just development returning to the mean. For most of its life Eve has been a great concept with half arsed development that could and maybe should have been far bigger than it ever managed to be.
---
Perhaps the one thing that's new is the complete lack of hope Eve will ever fulfill it's potential but frankly that's not even that new either. Maybe in the end the game just lived a little too long and whiffed a few too many times. Those devs that cared enough to play it appear to be long gone, seemingly replaced by people creating features 'inspired' by other games and brutally shoehorning them in regardless of suitabillity. In the end Eve has many things that feel unique but aren't that important in the day to day - the player driven market, the massive fleet fights, the endless politics all pique interest but aren't the average rando's daily bread and butter. The one true USP you could login and expect was the solo-to-small gang PVP, the randomness, the complexity and myriad compsitions you could use and come up against. And they threw that in the bin with SP Injectors. Eve 'died' the day it became capitals online and can't row back cause both the players and company are too heavily invested down that road. Everything else since is merely a symptom of a game with nothing much else to offer.
---
Just wish I cared as much as you do. That too is long past.
---
&gt;it was easy to see on year by year fanfest where there was less new content and ambitious projects in eve, less promo videos, less new content that matters. When we get 2 big expansions per year that was great, it keeps game alive, vibrant, it attracted new and old players, there was new or redone content for months of playing. 
---
Fuck the expansions and new content. The core of the game is the PVP. With shitty balance and bots and injectors, it dies.
---
It is incredibly likely that the absolutely retarded wardec system alone cost the game more players than a gradual lack of expansions ever would have.
---
Very nice changes. Wondering what the price difference for certain skills is gonna be as I held off on getting Minmatar Titan for a few weeks.
---
I really thought I was going to see something to combat skill farms and hacked accounts getting their sp ripped out like "limit to one extractor per week per account" or something.
---
Overall decent changes, but I feel they missed an obvious fix.
---
Yeah that line hit a little to close to home. I have to admit. 
---
Do they have a TZ or are they 23/7?
---
Every skill in EVE has a primary and secondary attribute for calculating how much SP per minute you gain while training it. Skills in one category usually have the same primary and secondary attribute. Ex: Spaceship Command skills have Perception and Willpower, while Engineering have Intelligence and Memory. Remaps allow you to maximize SP gain in some areas while sacrificing SP gain in others. This mechanic lets new players who actually think and plan ahead catch up to older players with a lot more SP spread out. Same thing with attribute boosters, though they give a bonus to every attribute.
---
&gt; Why should skill attributes exist in eve 2k19? 
---
So you can learn how to tie your own shoes
---
What the fuck is anyone doing carrying 10 bil worth of stuff in a 10 bill ship during burn jita?
---
New graphics card with old processor should do. Majority of the russki playerbase run with this setup.
---
Isn't it anything that isn't seeded can't be brought with SoD
---
thearrowofapollo &gt; NO FORTIZARS ANCHORED IN PURE BLIND!
---
Make it half price and i am in. Seriously.
---
6 min
---
So after the initial grind to get those support skills, training into a new ship will be like 2 weeks max to get the guns?
---
I would say allow remote injecting of all skills we already have it with a few things.
---
But then i will miss stupid arse killmails.
---
&gt;It's already a feature that hasn't seen any significant changes in nearly a decade
---
Why change something that isn't broken?
---
Surprisingly good change from CCP. Shouldn't impact economy too much as it's only for 'core skills' (which I'm guessing is all skills sold in NPC starter corp stations?) but also removes an unnecessary annoyance from the game (ah fuck I need this skill and have to go 7 jumps to get the book) as well as stopping newer players being unknowingly shafted on the market.
---
Not much plex left in the game. I would guess the confiscated plex is in a different category legally because of EULA violation.
---
It really depends on the day and who is Fcing. Your best bet is to join the in-game channel and in the MOTD it will say where to dock up and if they are running or not. WTM is VERY newbro/shitter friendly, they will walk you through how to do it if you don't know.
---
Stop getting bitchy about losing 1.5 b! Get a PLEX and chill mate
---
I hope they give the skills from exploration a little love. Help the newbies out and make data sites decent 
---
I shat my pants at first and though that it was some kind of buy SP for money lol 
---
And I caused climate change because I drive a car and take hot showers? It's not the 8 rorqual pilot, it's the whole system you ignoramus. 
---
Titan skill books are on the market from NPCs
---
I think it’s explained in the post somewhere there will still be the existing player market available for them, this is just another option. The player price I’d imagine will fall in between NPC price and skillsheet price 
---
Still looking for a good preset, happen to know any?
---
You only need one, why would you need in every lowsec.
---
It's a shit option. 
---
They could always have had skillbooks in the hole to hand-out to alphas. All you're doing is changing 'have spare skillbooks' to 'buy them from wspace'
---
Of all the wh corps in the game, maybe hk has the isk. And we both know  that hk didn't stock skillbooks, even though you could remotely inject sp. 
---
Come on bud. 
---
*this is not real just a shitpost (not)
---
+1 upvote
---
I scooped 2 x Hobgob I’s from a wreck in HS. Best week ever!!
---
Logoff freighters are easier now but this will definitely be a qol improvement overall
---
This system doesn't allow for catching up, it inherently throttles growth by the penalty you receive through a remap. 
---
Removing the attributes system and having a uniform sp/h would allow a fresh character to necessary skills for ships much faster since they do not all share the same attributes.
---
tldr: Core skills will be purchasable directly from the character sheet, rather than having to buy them in the market (and potentially fly some distance to fetch the skillbooks). Books for these skills will remain available and the price when purchasing from the character sheet will be higher than what the books are seeded for. Drop-only skills (e.g. triglavian stuff) will remain drop-only. Also a rebalance of skillbook prices is coming.
---
In a nutshell yes. The bigger the ship/gun the longer it will take. Although, unless you are interested in Null blob gameplay, the majority of the player base is in battlecruiser and down ship sizes, due to warp deceleration and not being clunky as hell. Ass frigs are in a great place, and cruisers are probably the most popular hull size imo. 
---
Well, in the devblog it only sounded like you couldn't get books that aren't seeded. Titan and other skillbooks are seeded in NPC stations.
---
Great, now we can all inject Chuck Tingle skills!
---
How do I enable that on mobile?
---
&gt;It can still be the case, depending on the margin. The more convenient the solution, the more it should cost.
---
There, we agree. If they scale the numbers so low-SP books have a small margin and high-SP books have a high margin, that leaves a market for book traders without hurting newbies' wallets. I hope CCP does that... but without any concrete numbers from the dev blog I have nothing but speculation to go on.
---
Would argue it is broken and has been so for some time. It isn't engaging gameplay, hurts the player more than helps and is extremely dated.
---
Well I’m half blind and on mobile, so thanks. 
---
£10 is disgusting for a skin on a single ship that you won't see half the time becuase you're zoomed out. CCP really fail here.
---
&gt; Realtalk: EVE is in ~~maintenance~~  cashout mode and we need to come to terms with that.
---
Good thing I can play 100% free with alpha :)

---
Z-S overview, google it and join ingame channel 
---
And android, don't forget android! Because we have phones!
---
Aie spik frainch ! 
---
We would be the biggest customers tbh, not gonna lie
---
&gt; If I had any choice at all I'd instead choose to restart EVE in it's current iteration with 0SP, 0ISK and with a newly generated map.
---
The players have changed far more than the game itself. Resets or rollbacks wouldn't undo the knowledge and sophistication that people have now. The chaos and crazy shit are what people remember, that was because everyone had no idea what they were doing or what really mattered. It wouldn't happen now.
---
having skillbooks ready means having potentially alot of isk sitting for potentially years in a wh. moving in alphas is free of charge. ISK is also a bad factor. pretty sure some eve nerd can make a max efficient low sp inject defense doctrine. usually there are more ships than toons in a wh.
---
Not saying this thing is a bad change. in contrast its good. however i dont understand why stuff like cap skills or t2 hulls or whatever is a bit more advanced has to be included if its for newbros.
---
Doesn't matter if he's explaining something to the god-emperor of the universe. Skillbooks ARE more expensive in Jita than NPC sell orders a couple jumps away, because people will pay for the convenience. Just look at the daily trade volumes for more popular skillbooks, and compare player sell orders to NPC sell orders. It isn't rocket science.
---
People will absolutely be spending more so they could have their skills NOW instead of going to Jita again. Which will be especially true for people based far away from any major trade hubs. In this case 'far away' might be as little as 5 jumps.
---
No, it shouldn't.
---
&gt;I know many hate injectors but it solved the greatest problem the game had. It balanced characters....... 
---
Lets ignore the fact that for at least 5-10 years, a ton of braindead, but vocal, regurgitators claimed "SP dont matter".
---
Injectors reduced the value of the main progression mechanic and created the isk explosion by granting instant access to end game "content" that essentially cannot be fixed without CCP taking a likely revenue hit.
---
Basically tragedy of the commons.
---
no goon only discount
---
correct, good point. saving your assets is easier 
---
Z-S and SaraShawa are good. 
---
Sara needed a bit more tweaking imo, but both are definitely useable. 
---
And here is howto for basic setting (i hope you are not afraid of goons, many people here are): https://wiki.goonfleet.com/Public:Overview_Settings
---
&gt; The game should’ve never left subscription only.
---
At least the ones who could never pay for it have the opportunity to experiment a greater part of the game. 15 days was _too few_ to experiment enough.
---
Delay and still push out shit is where we are now, at least for a lot of stuff. Don't rush me, I'm making mistakes as fast as I can.
---
This guy get is! 
---
CCP, if you not hire him, you are doing it wrong!
---
&gt;It also allowed the rich to get richer via injecting rorqual alts, etc.
---
A lot of that. It seems this was basically the idea from the get go. Thats why they came with no skill restrictions. Why do new players need instant access to end game ships/skills? Makes no sense to me.
---
I saw a documentation lately with a hidden-camera-clip from a Developer training at this fkn FarmVille company, i guess the name was Zynga. The instructor spoke about the customers as "stupid sheep to milk" and the content of the training was how to generate frustrating paywalls that urge the customer to pay without driving him away too early. Basically most mobile games today are developed around the goal to trap the customer in a circle of paying and not leaving because of sunk cost fallacy. Its disgusting ...
---
Basically, Mineclub was going ape shit as soon as they couldn't krab. The corp had buttload of drama and people cheapshoting each other for an anom or a rock, it was hilarious and sad at the same time.  
---
I remember when this sub had other posts than this constant fucking moaning.
---
This is top tier. Where do I donate to the kickstarter? 
---
you're right, i've capped my 5mln skill points, now i don't think i'll pay for omega because i can barely play 4-5hr a week.
---
It's only slightly less effort though in the grand scheme of things, I could see that home defense capital caches without pilots could be concerning but the books are likely 10% of the cost  so people could be holding them anyway
---
Keep going, I'm nearly there! 
---
hate it tbh. yet another change that takes some of the mystery and deliberate obstruction out of the universe. the reason players moved skill books before was to provide a service: convenience in the form of skillbooks being in a centralised, accessible location. ccp is undercutting that player-driven endeavour via a menu. i think it's another change that people will perceive as good because of the convenience, ignoring the fact that eve is a game that requires inconvenience to give interactions meaning and significance. once this change comes through i will never go to hisec for skills again, another reason to undock is removed.  
---
i think it's also fair to say that having some skills you can buy from the menu, and some you can't, will be at least as confusing to new players as the current system. and let's be real, this will just be another menu where ccp will try and flog space gold to new players. if the skill purchasing system or the market interface is confusing, the solution is to fix or improve those things, not bypass a whole layer of player interaction and then slap an advert on it.
---
Half? I might be playing wrong, i am zoomed out all the time. 
---
Most of the time i only recognize the ship i am flying by modules i use. :D
---
Not enough shiny plex containers. You need to promote the "buy" part more.
---
Other than that, not bad.
---
He probably mines in null in an orca
---
&gt;did you guys thought about wormholes when
---
You already know the answer to any question that starts with this!
---
Probably to late to do this now but when skill injection came out they should have barred the use of un-allocated skill points from capital skills. Titans and Rorquals online would not exist then.
---
&gt; new jump gates
---
Yay, no fatigue for the big bois, its almost as now that goons have overtaken PanFam, everything that was cried about as bad &amp; nerfed back then now comes back with a new name.
---
- Phoebe patch (on of the best ever) reversed with new gates
---
- Tracking Titans back with HAW guns ....
---
&gt; Basically most mobile games today are developed around the goal to trap the customer in a circle of paying and not leaving because of sunk cost fallacy.
---
This. And only this. But once you see through their schemes, it completely sucks the gun out of it. 
---
THe ffunies thing is, they really started aiming at whales lately (understandable as one whale player often spends more than 1000 normal people, so why cater to them, when all they really need to appease are the whale players.
---
Did I just read a greentext on reddit?
---
Does someone have a list of skills that are "rare" or "dropped" other than Triglavian skills?
---
Not really, I won EVE like 4 years ago cause it was too stagnant for my tastes. I simply think that all of what he brought up contributes even more to said stagnation.
---
[Got you fam.](https://i.imgur.com/ihepf1u.jpg)
---
It's qol in general. 
---
Yes, it's expensive to stockpile skillbooks. 100 muninns would be 4b. Maybe that's missing a few books - 6b. Nothing. 
---
To stockpile yachts? Basically free.
---
Carriers? Now that's expensive, but it will be expensive regardless. 10 carriers is like 10b in books at present, maybe a little less. 
---
If they want 50 carriers, that's 50b plus the injectors
---
And of course, they need the fits on hand. And the injectors. And the alphas. 
---
So it's currently not much to have a home defence doctrine in skillbooks rn. Hacs are like 4-6b for 100 books. If it's t1 bs, like tempests, even less. 
---
The injectors make it a non-viable solution. That's about it. 
---
CCPlease...
---
Yeah, lets promote the "locking" of skills. Its just arbitrarily "locked".
---
Who cares about the 64 bit client? I'm hyped about the new new renewed agency redesign!!! hell yeah!
---
I made several bil from exoplanet skins. There is just way too much supply for the prices to stay up. Wont be an issue with plex.
---
Just about everything you listed was a CCP fuckup in the first place, and each was allowed to negatively impact the game for ages before any action was taken.  Worse yet, most of the solutions ended up being relatively simple fixes that could have been implemented much earlier if CCP had actually cared enough to dedicate time to it.  Instead, time and time again they waited until things boiled over and pressure came from not only the forums and reddit, but the CSM as well.
---
This is hardly a glowing recommendation.
---
That has to do with the source rather than the skin
---
I've given up on "premium" skins a long time ago. Nothing good is reasonably priced, nothing reasonably priced is anything else but total shit. There's microtransactions in games for you. This applies to the entire fucking industry BTW.
---
Phew good thing I actually read the article
---
Is it predominantly the base racial ships or pirate faction ships?
---
People who don't want to waste a week or two grinding for a fucking texture.
---
Except...they're not actually doing these things.  Making promises of doing things, and actually doing them are two very different things.
---
Newbro btw, what major improvements to custom overviews offer?
---
Just show it for three days.
---
lol
---
its not that eve is dying its that the eve I enjoyed playing is dead. There is no resource scarcity, no need to to conquer sov for renter income or money moons. This combined with citadels means there is no way to hard evict someone. Prior to citadels if you killed their towers, anchored your own, and took their stations that was it there was no bullshit staging citadels they could spam. If you took their staging citadel they couldn't evac to one of the other 60 citadels in system. 
---
Wars if they do happen are won when the other guy decides to quit, but there are no hard objectives that say "Ok, this is their last station in this region after we take it its over"
---
L O L! "THIS IS NOT TRUE!!".

"However I totally checked with CCP via support ticket if I could do the exact thing I denied doing two hours ago. "

I wittnessed this in a small mobile game I played from 2014-2017 on my phone when I was taking a poop at work XD, it was a very simple to develop base builder with 4 basic unit types and so on. At the beginning I also paid about 2.50 $ a week for smaller things, it was ok and I managed to climb up to the top 20 on the server. After a while the prices for actions and items wre rising, the frequency of pay events also. At the end you had to invest close to 30$ PER DAY, just to grab all dailies. Then one account I had farmed for years was sold to a whale that started late and had an even worse own account. Within the time of a few weeks this account went to server top and I calculated the amount invested in it. Until the moment I stopped playing this guy had dumped the amount of something between 3k - 4k $ per month into the account over at least 6 months ... 
---
We need "BeepBoop" bot skin for VNI.
---
I'm sure they're pouring tons of money into that research already.  Monetization strategy seems to be the only thing these yahoos care about anymore.
---
Dude you should just quit and stop whining on internet forums. You sound like every other poster on /r/ for the last 3 weeks. It's time to move on and just play the game again (or don't). If it's truly bleeding playerbase and tanking, then we get to move on with our lives (or what's left of them anyway).
---
Sorry you need to delete your post because it could it could be copyrighted.
---
Yes, 100% on point. But you should also consider the new skins available and we are having a plex sale next week......
---
If you mean Nova by the "FPS thing", its basically dead in the water now after it turned out sucking huge nuts after years of work.
---
We should incrementally remove all of what makes eve interesting until we're left with Wow
---
he can have my old receipts, I never wanted them too much.
---
In short: I allows seeing stuff that you actually want to see in a certain situation. 
---
Also having multiple tab presets creating means you can load new ones on the fly, ie: swap that "only dictor" window to a "only logi ships" in a couple of seconds.
---
Also, color coding stuff.
---
Also, wider tabs for those with fat fingers
---
Also, separate presets for dscan
---
Extensive overview is the lifeblood of Eve, it's coplicated to setup but gives tremendous window for customisation. Thing is, it's not at all explained nor shown for new players and only **after** they've installed some custom one can they truly understand the potential.
---
but only the original, it uses a brand new DRM to make SURE you can't play it on an emulator.
---
But that’s not what he asked, that ‘12 MB had a 64bit capable processor, and was definitely running Lion, if not Mountain Lion shortly after your purchase which means you were *forced to run* a 64bit OS as well
---
He is totally free to blackmail, scam, etc. That is part of eve. The issue is he expects people to believe him when he says "Hey this corp is botting, you should boot them from their rental space". However, when you run around scamming and blackmailing, you lose all credibility to do that. I made no demands, I merely stated that this poster has lost all credibility based on his actions. 
---
All the same would you do it though?
---
I'd remove killboards also so people stop jacking off over them
---
What the actual fuck is this whole thing? 
---
I'd assume much longer than for a lowsec gate to stain.
---
Even if we could ever agree on 'what the community wants' - and then agree that the community primarily wanted CCP to work on the back end - I don't think it's reasonable to expect that this should come at the expense of the current state of the game.
---
It's not about new features or content either; it's about what problematic older additions continue to do to EVE as long as they remain unchecked.  The more time that goes by wherein CCP allows rorqual and capital imbalances to wreak havoc on the game, the less it matters what they do with the back end.
---
It really depends on what you are doing and how you like to play the game. I personally like being useful to my corp/allaince so I'm generally in support ships. E-war, logi, or tackle since most people who play games want to do dank damages. My best advice is to find a fun activity and then skill into that. In the meantime, train the magic 14, ( https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14 ) your support gunnery/missile/drone skills, armor/shield compensation skills. Those skills transfer to everything, then once you figure out whats fun to you, you'll be in good shape to get the required skills to use/fly them.
---
Endgame, Mining. Poor Soul
---
&gt; any common-sense gamer would get a Rorqual and print ISK.
---
So you implying that all "common sense gamers" are economic retards not knowing how this would affect the economy of EVE and the PLEX market ?
---
no, i hate everything that clutters up the screen. if evekill was still a thing id use that because the zkill UI is screenjunk garbotrash. also fuck everything new.  
---
&gt;level 2KiakriOriginal PosterScore hidden · 37 minutes ago · edited 29 minutes agoI would say allow remote injecting of all skills, we already have it with a few things.But then i will miss stupid arse killmails.ReplyGive AwardsharereportSave
---
You can already inject at a distance, right? Or I might miss the point of your comment.
---
I usually buy the injector through a toon at Jita, then contract the char I want to inject in, and through the asset management window inject the skill injector from anywhere.
---
Nobody plays a video game asking themselves "is this going to benefit the market of eve online" they play to put themselves at a big advantage
---
i do like the idea of being able to subsidise members purchases of skills. going forward I would think it is a nice addition to the system as proposed.
---
however...
---
&gt;  a major part of the newbro experience
---
i think its done this way because for alliance logisitics its currently easier to just give away skill book packs than it is to seed the market with 100 different new player friendly skill books. rather than tying up market slots and selling at NPC price + tiny profit, just give them away to newbeans.
---
Much salt u have. Show us on the doll where the goon touched you.

Old reddit best reddit tbh.

To expand, a hole connecting null to highsec will be of type [B449](http://anoik.is/wormholes/B449) which has a Max Mass per Jump of 1,000,000,000 kg which is less than the mass of any capital ship.
---
Soon™
---
go away.
---
Its the u/Jibrish mod, wants this subreddit to die
---
good post thanks
---
He means injecting skillbooks remotely, that currently does not work.
---
SP injecting works remotely, you are right.
---
:P
---
Don't drop it in the bowl.
---
Nope - Citadel was quite a big leap and has dramatically changed the landscape of Nullsec, WH space and FW lowsec. On top of this we have had the Capital and Rorqual changes, T3Ds introduced and the rather drastic changes to AF and HACs which has really pushed them into a role.  
---
I will say though that since 2016 things have slowed down quite a lot, although once they've got over the giant hurdle of releasing a 64 bit client things might speed up again a fair bit.
---
0 mining yield

I accomplish this with t1 frigs, assualt frigs, t3ds, epithals, covert ops and crusiers.
---
Well he is a Goon so...........
---
i tend to agree. perhaps all skill Alphas can train should be in this system, as well as some that are Omega only purely for balance reasons, like cloaking and PI skills.
---
Yes huge leap. Gave us stations.
---
indeed
---
It's a shame people will continue to engage in free labour for CCP. 
---
"Oh you want ads made for your game, for free? Hold on let me make sure I'm subbed and work on this for you. "
---
It's like Near2 but goon supported. 
---
i believe you were aiming for "Upventure yes" and "Downventure no"
---
inb4 its a prospect and endurance
---
Totally right. Skill is not the difficult part when you start playing eve.
---
HAHAHAHA
---
&gt; This mechanic lets new players who actually think and plan ahead catch up to older players with a lot more SP spread out 
---
IMO older players with long training time skills queue would be more likely to gain benefit from this remapping mechanic over a new players who have to scramble for 100 basic skills.
---
People can only catch up with injectors anyway so the "catching up" point might as well be moot.
---
Make everything easier so banality reigns supreme!
---
LOL even linked the km
---
Idk about you but I never find a lack of content nor am I interested in pve yet I understand everyone is different. 
---
This is my fetish
---
&gt; via an isk cap.
---
also a convenience boost.
---
stuck in nullsec staging? import from jita or buy from character sheet. I know what i'd choose.
---
My Corp has a standard overview in the Corp motd for this exact reason
---
bwahahahhaa
---
LOL, do you think the same about people killing other people (ingame), called Pirats, or Jita scammers? You think by choosng this (legit) playstyle they lose credibility? Oh boy you should turn off the PC more often and go out. You have issues mixing up a game and RL.
---
No
---
10% lmao they're insignificant in the cost of things. Injectors are the real cost and you can already do that remotely, y'all just complaining to complain.
---
you better skill yourself to become so elite like we goons are
---
Wyvern will be better for him for the 20% resist lol :p
---
Needs reference to "Omega opens up more skills, that you can skill farm".
---
Hahaha.  If only we could be as lucky to have the number of active devs, amount of regular updates/fixes, and community support that "maintenance mode" Guild Wars 2 will have even post-layoffs.
---
CCP certainly tried hard at one point - going against the grain to make something amazing.  But to pretend that's still the case is a wild fucking hallucination at best.
---
You think so low of goons. Are you gonna roast the other major factions to?
---
Good chance for new players. And the markup for skills on demand seems fair to me.
---
Rise isn't the brightest crayon in the box
---
See?  This just proves that if they hired redditors then Eve would be the perfect game.
---
Maybe in games where the audience is aged around 16 avg., yes. But EVE avg age is somewhere around 30, and I am far above that. There are a lot of people well educated that play this game and maybe they have some economic knowledge exceeding yours, or maybe even Hilmars ...
---
another noob feature.. yeah dev good time being wasted on useless stuff like this, while bugs remain unfixed and some game elements unbalanced forever. I can't remember a time when acquiring a skillbook gave me headaches, but dozens other things. Does remapping an occupied keyboard shortcut actually still ask you to unbind it first? 
---
What fucking work dude?
---
Where do I buy?
---
&gt;They've killed every other game because they keep attempting to find the magic of what made EVE great and unique while also wholly avoiding what made EVE great and unique.  
---
kind of
---
they killed every other game because they're just half assed pieces of shit. at the time dust was released there was essentially zero major cross platform mmo interaction. it had the potential to revolutionize the way people not only play eve but the industry in general and capture this wider audience they so desperately need.  
---
you're a strategist? maybe you want to just hang out and mine while watching netflix? or you might just love going out solo and getting awesome frags - sweet, eve is the game for you. but maybe while you have downtime why not swap over to dust, get a little fps action while you're half afk anyway.  
---
how many eve players are on comms playing apex, wow, league, or whatever other fotm games come out when (if ccp wasnt literally unable to capitalize on one of the most fanatical fanbases in the industry) they could have captured those players on other branded titles... if they weren't just halfhearted bullshit.  
---
we also saw the scrapping of what seemed to be a pretty expansive mmo in production (after they had presumably wasted a shitload of money developing much of it), and the release of a vr title (dude who would have possibly imagined the 10000th iteration of vr wouldn't have taken off especially since you still have to set up all this stupid bullshit equipment in ur fucking house wow mind blown xD), and finally [a vr tennis game lol](https://www.playsparc.com/).  
---
imagine if they had spent an iota of that time on eve online pve iteration so it wasn't specifically one of not only the most broken and unfun elements of this game but one of the major contributors of burnout in the title as well. imagine if they had held legitimate competitive tournaments with actual prizes like the fighting game community started to do in order to drum up sponsors and widen interest in the title by showing off the vibrant and hilarious community this game once had. imagine if they hadn't bet the farm on the untested vr market and instead relied upon the community that had their back years later even after they specifically released internal memorandums talking about how they were going to fuck the community over with cosmetics. imagine if they actually rewarded activity and skill and pushed players to push themselves instead of constantly rewarding the least engaging activities in the game and glorifying players with the most limited interaction with others. imagine if they were still the company that put up that monument to their players years ago lol  
---
this company does not care. they are trying to survive and doing a terrible job of it. theyre becoming victim to their own years of ineptitude. 
---
Z-S is awesome but not updated since Abyss iirc, and it's kinda pita to modify coz if you do it from the game level saving will break the &lt;color&gt; tag. 
---
coz fucking reasons. 
---
[excuse my French, but a vision to add cyno field to 30+ presets in a yaml file using a text editior is not something that most games require after an update]
---
They are pretty damn different from Outposts and POSes - both to run and to attack/defend with, so other than the fact they're structures in space owned by players myself and many other people who use them for more than docking in can happily say they are quite a large leap from what we had.
---
just have an alliance panel that lasts three days. they used to be entertaining as fuck.
---
Have you checked the default overview in the past 2-3 months? It was updated to a new pre-set that is (whilst not as complicated as the standard presets) significantly better and easier to navigate. As an FYI the reason you can't just port Z-SS is that EVE has to be compliant with weird default screen sizes like 800x600, which Z-SS is not.
---
I will accelerate the schedule. We must attain the shitpost singularity!
---
Game needs new players period. The first few hours of this game are way to complicated for a brand new player that does not have a mentor. 
---
You must admit there tends to be an excellent correlation
---
I'm not complaining it's a good change 
---
yeah maybe we should just be able to buy ore from the menu as well. industry is a core part of the game, having a acquire resources from npcs or players just makes me feel like I'm wasting my time! 
---
The reps have said in the feedback thread that rare skills (non-seeded and thus not available via the character sheet under the new system) will have a note on the skill in the character sheet about how to obtain it. Currently, it's already confusing as to why some are available in the starting station, some in other stations but not that one, and some don't show on the regional market at all, so this will make it much less confusing.
---
As to the first point, they have confirmed there would be a mark-up over skillbook prices, so whilst a veteran player who currently will pay an extra mil or ten to avoid the hassle of travel because it's more than made back in a single ratting tick, newbies to whom isk isn't as easy to come by will be tempted to travel to save a few thousand. So you can still do the resale markup game, just there's a cap on how much you can overprice by before it becomes cheaper to buy via the character sheet. Skills are already inconvenient due to the time gating, and seeded books are normally in fairly safe areas so not like there's any risk getting avoided: they're just removing a time-waste.
---
Yeah it s crazy , they just dont know so much about burn jita or are new imo.
---
Yea but the tank is pretty much the only thing Wyvern has going for him :\\
---
Current state of EVE mixed with all of their failures proves they're not really good at anything.  The devs responsible for the magic of EVE are long, long gone, as is most (all?) of the general talent.
---
Sure but they worked on citadel's for 4 years now.
---
only 20% of marketing is advertising.  
---
80% of marketing is creating the right product for the market.
---
this is the right product.
---
 People who made EVE  good left 
---
&gt; Until the moment I stopped playing this guy had dumped the amount of something between 3k - 4k $ per month into the account over at least 6 months ... into a shitty mobile game programmed by 3-4 Hongkong Middle School dropouts ....
---
Ugh, if only this was isolated games. I played one similar game at the end of it lifespan and devs actually went the opposite way, they  made a ton of events that let us almost max our accounts - with clever thinking you could at least double your premium currency each day without any additional spending for like 30 days in a row. 
---
So i went to server #2 and all the russians who put their money into the game before (hundereds, maybe thousands) were pretty pissed of and left the game. 
---
Needless to say, i left soon after. What good is maxed account when there are like 10 people playing on the server and 9 of them is in your alliance, because duh.
---
*"Shit man look at Any Blizzard title from the past 10 years. Nobody has tried to re-invent the wheel or iterate in a risky way like CCP has. CCP might fuck up routinely but at least they actually try. Nothing ventured nothing gained, most MMOs are in a stagnant lockstep release cycle that nobody gives a shit about."*
---
I have to agree. that is the reason why I always return to eve
---
of course you won't provide a screenshot, you are either lying or you were lied to and believed it. 
---
&gt;no i will not post its name on reddit....like dafuq is wrong with you to even ask that
---
i didn't ask that? i asked for a screenshot or any sort of proof other than some "i know a guy" bullshit 
---
asking for proof when you make ridiculous claim does not mean there is anything wrong with me, it simply means i am not a gullible idiot like a lot of people on this sub seem to be 
---
hmm lets do the math on that then 
---
1*300=300. 300*10=3000 , 3t per toon
---
2.5*300=750. 750*10=7500, 7.5t per toon
---
5*300=1500. 1500*10=15000, 15t  per toon 
---
pretty good numbers, of course this is over 10 years 300days a year and i can't remember a single person that i knew that could tolerate grinding isk for even 2years at 300days a year without burn out  
---
yeah, i'm gonna stick to my opinion that there are  plenty of liars around when it comes to this, not that many actual real people. 
---
There might be 10 guys with 30t+ yes, but i honestly doubt it. So far this list is maybe aryth, maybe entity, who else? 
---
Most of the people i knew in game that had plenty of isk stopped caring so much about growing their wallet to the next level at around 1-5t. at that point they usually either stopped caring entirely about isk or they just went full maintenance mode and didn't like dropping below their x point. Making isk in this game is a fucking chore outside of patch speculation but good speculation opportunities for trillionaires are rare
---
what's wrong with it?
---
I really enjoy the game though and most people I know enjoy it too.
---
The galaxy pack of the future is here!
---
wut butter safe
---
How much $$$ does a bot make in 3 month if it's VNI
---
I just tested that and hit the "reset overview". It seems very similar to I've seen in 2013 when I first started Eve. Sure, it's functional in a sense that ships are there, cynos are there. 
---
But ie: folks with -5 sec status are still red despite being in your alliance.
---
Folks with criminal/suspect status will still blink if they're in your alliance **unless** they're in a fleet with you.
---
But how should twitch audience see the nice skin on your ratting Nyx then?
---
rAnd? Do you want it a working product later or a broken one now?
---
Because that’s exactly the same as having to spend 5-30 minutes ingame on fetching a single skillbook because you’d like to spend a week training some skill.
---
People complain that everything in Eve takes hours to do. Isn’t it smart to maybe streamline some of the worse timewasters?
---
Who in the history of this entire game enjoyed spending time flying to fetch a skillbook so that they can have the luxury of waiting for a skill to train?
---
Ah i see, it makes sense when you broadcast. :D
---
EVE, a game dying before it was released.
---
The fun of highsec incursions was **A)** some of the most accessible ISK printing available in the game and **B)** striving to run the sites as efficiently as possible to finish them in the shortest time and achieve record payouts.
---
There's a better way to do **A** now so fewer good FCs are drawn to HS Incursions and **B** doesn't work unless everybody is Omega flying max-DPS low-buffer autism chariots.
---
I would liken FCing a fleet of Alphas to teaching a special ed class in one's spare time.
---
no one complained. it was merely stated that it can have a new effect on a minority of the playerbase in an eviction. so basicly a rare situation no one cares about cause its very unlikely to effect the majority of players. thats all. i dont think the ISK aspect matters to much but having the skillbooks ready prolly does. alteast i dont have spare skillbooks in my wh today lmao 
---
&gt;more capitals are dying now than ever in the history of the gam
---
Because everyone and their mother has a cap these days, perhaps? Therefore more die?

Good, so a little hope remains ;)
---
Its really sad that as of today (end of feb.) we have nothing official from CCP regarding content updates / expansion / roadmap for 2019. Thats not really reassuring in light of the recent buyout / the general layoffs in the gaming industry (Blizz/Areanet/Daybreak/etc.)...
---
Swipe that credit card goy
---
Non-seeded skillbooks:    
---
* neurotoxin drug skills
---
* drone specialization
---
* a few w-space sciences
---
* social ___ connections
---
* precursor ships
---
I guess the weird case would be skillbooks that are only seeded in restricted areas like racial capships.
---
I'm guessing these SKINs aren't finished yet.
---
You'll notice that there's two holograms on the back end of the Ishtar, one of them is broken.
---
The the other Caille Neon skins might get it yet.
---
Use the Kafferton fork, they have a link to it on the Gitlab page for Z-S, it was updated in December and has the new upwell stuff and cyno groupings. I've been using it since mid December and it's better than Z-S imo.
---
Exactly. It will be limited to a max value imposed by the npc price. 
---
Pretty sure they don't want my feedback.
---
Does salt mined count?
---
Yeah that line got me as well.  #SuitoniaWasRight
---
Also also, specific profiles for brackets so your game doesn't hit 10fps when there are suddenly 500 ship and 1000000 drone icons to draw.
---
As I have been playing since 2012, and still love the game because of the fact it allows players to 'play the sandbox game like they want to', I earnestly, honestly, vehemently wish that ANYONE and EVERYONE that constantly trashes the game, bitches, rants, REEEEEEs, declares the game dead and/or dying, disparages the game, devs, owners, players for whatever reason.. Would GET the FUCK out of EVE and this Reddit and go back to WoW or whatever they find to be 'the most awesomest game ever' and leave the rest of us who still like the game for what it is, to continue playing it and hoping for any and all improvements, tweaks, QOLs in the future...
---
Glorious! &lt;3
---
In an odd way, this post reminds me a lot of when CCP assured EVE players that they'd get back to spaceships, but that they needed :18months: to get Incarna out the door and working.
---
Don't get me wrong, I totally agree this needs to be done, but the parallel is becoming striking: CCP is focused on this to the exclusion of everything else.
---
As a person who kept selling caldari BCS’ through market up to 2018 with a 30% markup from market...nah, the ceiling is not working :P

---
Im gonna put this on my botting ishtar just for the irony

Hmm, In 12 years I never bought a skill from a player. There are NPC-Stations that sell them and in good organisations something like starter skillbook packs are free in corphangar ....

“ keep the PVP meta fresh”
---
Heard it here first chaps. The meta is always fresh. Definitely not stale as fuck but in fact,minty fresh. 
---
I'd like to know the number of unique humans playing the game concurrently nowadays vs 2013. My guess is that multiboxing has gone way up and the actual number of butts in chairs is way down but that's just a guess.
---
Gevlon Goblin? Is that you?
---
My first thought was DUST 514-style training where unallocated SP accrues and then you dump it into skills as desired.
---
I'm gonna blow your mind and tell you that there are a ton of people who play with the markets of the real world to their own advantage and damn the consequences it has on the larger structures of society. People do not play video games to help the devs maintain a harmonic economic utopia, they play to win.
---
Hard to continue to invest time in a game when the owner of said game does so little to reinvest in their product and customers. The long drift to irrelevance continues and my money drifts away too
---
Did you really? You realize I support more restrictions?
---
I just started yesterday and having fun so far. Sucks to see this type of post in a game I wanted to spend a lot of time in.
---
REEEEEEEEE
---
also grrr goons :D 
---
gf
---
&gt; All the same would you do it though?
---
I dunno, I'd have to think about it for a while. My gut feeling is that it would be 6 months of amazing fun with lots of vets coming back to the game, then crash dead.
---
&gt; I'd remove killboards also so people stop jacking off over them
---
agreedo 100%
---
excuse me for being disappointed with the state of something i used to have a lot of love for.
---
man you are pathetic. all the changes that your refer to as " good" are nothing but catering to the capital menace and the shit 0sec blocks.
---
the rest of the player base doesnt have much ,if any, advantage of those changes.
---
so yeah...how about pulling your head out of your rorquals/ratting carrier/supers arse...and LOOK at eve in the full perspective. 
---
sitting in some 0sec empire, and not seeing whats going on around you...typical.
---
Hope you're doing well Rise.
---
the refined structure system is lame
---
Everyone has citadels now, it has completely ruined FW space, asset safety means losing them isn't a big deal. If these structures could be limited to just null / wh space with no asset safety, that would be great.
---
And get rid of skill injectors while we're at it.
---
Only worth it when on sale 50% off.
---
The t3 rework, so when the semi-used t3cs fell off existence and it became loki online?
---
Upwell 2.0, aka holy shit there's too many structures we fucked up
---
Machs online was caused by voidbombs, which were shit, blatantly shit, and took forever to fix.
---
Ghost training is still a thing. It was posted how to do it here like a month ago. 
---
Default overview changes after how many fucking years. 
---
Rorq ancil nerfs, cool. Where's the meaningful ones, aka their broken local tank (which remains) and their broken invulnerability module
---
Come on man. 
---
Tbh I'd buy that. And I'm probably not a bot 
---
Maybe it's not the game maybe it's you.  Ten years plus same game you changed just as much as the game has.
---
yup.
---
[BBTB IRL?](https://i.imgur.com/Y9xlhSh.jpg)
---
Oh, my bad, I misread. Forgive me; I am strung super thin. This change, man.
---
For the most ppl here its hate and love at the same time :) but i agree with you :D
---
Many who complain simply enjoyed the game they joined but not the direction CCP have been trying to take it.
---
Eve is a very different game now to what it was 5+ years ago
---
you stay in and all your stuff stays in. If you try to undock you get a warning that you can't dock again because the access changed.
---
You could just biomass all your characters.
---
Admittedly that takes a few days, but still.
---
It was announced after I started in like 2014/2015 so about 4 years. 
---
How many Chinese cocks does it takes?
---
Are you so disappointed that you no longer play the game?
---
It is absolutely, perfectly fine to be disappointed. I get the impression you have played longer that I have been.  If you are still playing, why focus on the negative?
---
If you have already 'won EVE' and quit, why continue to devote precious seconds to its Reddit when you could be pwning whatever game you have graduated to?
---
This is a very sensible change, great for new players.  It also offers a quality of life improvement for all players since you no longer have to haul your player to a market to buy some random skill you are missing.  I wish all skill books could be remotely injected like injectors/extractors but this change still makes a huge difference.
---
Kpop is..... kpop music videos are good just turn the sound off
---
So you are a botter?
---
nice talk shit again Gangrene , you become good!!
---
I was afraid it would be a CS item that would losslessly dump SP from selected skills into Unallocated or something similar. 
---
PLEX was actually a clever way to allow RMT. It was introduced initially to fight against RMT by offering a legitimate way of doing it.
---
Skill injectors though seem to really twist things around, especially with the advent of alpha clones.

I play to have fun with my mates, If you want to win current EVE you have to make it your job. Thats not what I intend to do.
---
There's still a *lot* to do in Eve.  You and u/jediASU are **years** away from where many veterans are, where they've been playing this game so long that things get stale without some change and upheaval every so often.  It's a legitimate complaint for them, that CCP has made changes that calcify the game into a state that's stale for them, but it doesn't trickle down to you guys yet.  You're both right, in essence.  It's a sandbox after all, widely varying perspectives are to be expected.
---
It's not. 
---
(if it was, then I'd be, umm, less than quiet about it.)
---
I did too when I joined it... still do.
---
I just don't understand why anyone who hates/dislikes/is so disappointed in game they used to play, STILL waste their time on bitching about it when they could be spending that time on whatever game they 'graduated' to...
---
Much like Eve itself, it looks like Wingspan is on the decline. Truly a sad day for us all.
---
Your post is sadly reflective of your companies position on the matter
---
This is good.
---
A little maintenance is fine, makes you enjoy the game even more when they add new stuff.   
---
CSM seemed happy so hopefully we gonna see a FW rework soon. This in my opinion would fix the game. I love FW and I don't care about anything else. :D

---
\&gt;  We are streamlining that experience, and instead now you will be told that key combination is in use and **are offered to rebind it to your new shortcut.** 
---
Because they still have hope.
---
Hope that ccp will take the game back in the direction of the things that made them fall in love with the game 5, 10, or 15 years ago.
---
huh?
---
Me too. This sub once inspired me to integrate reddit as whole into my life. Now its encouraging me to get the fuck rid of it. 
---
*slowly puts away pitchfork*
---
Don't worry the ability to buy the skill fully trained w/ premium currency will be added in a few patches down the ~abyss~ road
---
I just don't understand why anyone would bitch about people bitching.
---
there goes my main income source
---
Just drop more and more and more then some more and some more. Its aids to fight citadels and they are cheap as chips.                    
---

If your willing to lose them the enemy will eventually lose out of shier boredom
---
I mine approximately ~1 Bill./Hour, so thats PLEX for like 11 Subs a Day.
---
dude man your truly havent met the real eve nerds yet. obviously. and your math is so bad..did u even go to school?
---
i give u an example . lets take the best possbile numbers.
---
 10 toons generating 5 bil a day. = 50 bil.  x 300 = 1.5 tril x10= 150 tril.
---
and thats just an average very simple thought. 
---
sometimes dudes make a huge profit in 1 day on 1 or more toons, by simple luck..or whatever reasons.
---
and again. i have no idea why u so triggered about it. 
---
if its influencing your gameplay, you wouldnt even recognize 
---
( or are u investigating every market change on whatever module price changes, back to the asteroid the minerals came from?)
---
i do not care who this aryth guy is or was.
---
theres plenty of those dudes.
---
most of them clever enoguht to keep their mouth shut and not posting screenshots of their riches/assets.
---
and now calm your nipples.
---
start using your brain (yes that chunk of grey matter between your ears)
---
so you probably eventually realize..theres lots of richguys ingame...they are also none of your buisness, and prolly give 0 fucks about whatever your thoughts about them are.
---
o/
---
have a nice day.
---
lol goon pleb
---
get dropped
---
I have read the number of 1.7 Accounts per player in 2013 (find no source tbh). Watching the developement It should be closing in on 2.5 or 3.0. So my elaborate guess is thet we are at 50% of real players of 2013 at max.
---
Belay that
---
Can we have a shark year now and get rid of shit like this more permanently? 
---
The AT will be a profit source, that is their goal. Abyssals are the testing grounds for arenas and stations will become player-made gambling dens. They just need to divorce the gambling from real money and company organization as much as possible. And CCP seemed to talk a lot about the importance of gambling.
---
Generally, I would recommend getting back on the Xanax. It will be ok old man.
---
"still has hope" means they are either still playing the game or are watching the reddits and blogs to see if things have improved enough for them to come back... 
---
Reeeee posting and declaring the game dead does absolutely nothing but discourage anyone looking to start playing (which keeps the player base from growing), or pushes those on the fence about staying further away from playing (which decreases the player base)... 
---
How about doing/saying something positive if you are still playing... or saying nothing at all if you have already 'won EVE' by quitting?
---
It seems more real because this sub is a toxic shithole. 
---
Changing the architecture is a big step so i can see why they need more time to squash bugs.    
---
IMO is kind of a waste of resources, but i heard it will prevent the game to crash in big NS engagements so it's fine.

If you're gating a jf through hs between regions for example, you leave jump range quickly. So you gotta burn your cyno in a route that stays in range or have multiple cynos
---
How far down the barrel are CCP scraping. We have a ton of issues. I dont think Ive ever seen a complaint that this was an issue :/  
---
Cant we just fix that crap we have first please :/ 
---
Wow, guys...it's over. I've officially found the most bleating-retarded post on the internet for today.
---
EVE is dying posts have been made for as long as the game has existed. Going on 16 years now.
---
OP has some good points but you don't have to worry about the game being dead and gone next year or anything.
---
I guess/hope they still struggle how to replace all the content and the ISK- &amp; Material-sink POS fights have been

Hello! Just interested in getting into the skill farming business. Around how much sp can I get per month? Assuming +5 implants and remapped to be optimal. Is it possible to even earn a lot of isk with mptc, plex, and extractor costs so high?
---
I wouldn't even try to monitor the behavior of bots, it is incredibly difficult and time consuming.  Rather, just follow the money.  All that isk has to end up somewhere.  Once you find where the isk is going, just work your way back out to ban all the connected accounts. 
---
i have actually. They aren't at 30t+, people at that level are very unique
---
10 toons generating 5b a day you say, doing what exactly? 
---
i have no idea why you are so triggered that i am triggered... 
---
it's not influencing my gameplay and i don't play anymore anyway, i am simply tired of people throwing numbers out that they have no idea about the true cost of. Like you are doing now. 
---
of course you don't, you know 10 players that are richer than him that no one knows the name of, why would you care about the 1 guy that has at least a lot of people that will say that he is at that level of wealth when you know your 10 guys have even more for sure. absolute idiot 
---
most of them don't exist and no there is not plenty of them, if there was plenty of them there would be more than 2 names that are semi confirmed to have 30t. what cleverness exactly, this isn't rl people can't just reach into your wallet and steal your shit. people at 2-5t are gonna be using alts and more alts and associating 1 name with your wealth would make 0 difference 
---
you telling someone to use their brain is funny considering how utterly braindead you are 
---
o/ have a shit day you fucking idiot 
---
For a moment there you got me CCP! 
---
people are bitching. because they hope their voices get heard by ccp.
---
if all the people would simply keep their mouth shut and eat whatver ccp shoves into their mouths....
---
also dont be blind to whats going on. eve loses players ( veterans ) constantly. 
---
you ever enjoyed any npsi community ingame?
---
if so, ull see a declining in fleetnumbers, fleetmember numbers, FCs...over the last 6months.
---
Public fleets/communities are always a good indicator for the general health status of games like eve simply because players from all over the game, and from all kinds of playstyles / backgrounds/alliances/corps..join in npsi fleets....
---
if public communities starts to slow down due to a lack of players participating....
---
i think u catch my drift.
---
How do bots launder the isk?  At some point it has to be transfered / spent right?  And in large sums.  Seems like CCP could do a much better job at tracking the transactions that are suspect and then banning all connected accounts. 
---
Isnt that the new module storage for 64bit container client streaming? Placeholder!
---
&gt; Most mechanics in EVE are very simple. The complexity in this game emerges from the sheer quantity of mechanics and their various interactions.
---
&gt; Due to this, 80% of the problems in this game could be solved largely or entirely by tweaking stats without any significant code changes.
---
to which I respond with:
---
&gt; In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state.
---
Sure, just tweak numbers, super simple.
---
????????????
---
Did you notice how it says the skill can be unlocked?
---
Oh confusing for new players... Let the role players have something I guess
---
The sub being a toxic shithole doesn't mean that they're wrong.  
---
If you honestly think the game is in a healthy state then you're lying to yourself.
---
Go away, nothing to see here.
---
!!! BTW HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW SKINS!!!
---
Why would you be gating for more than 4-5 gates. If your gating for regions your doing it wrong.
---
Forgetting to swap out of training clone is sort of a rite of passage isn’t it though? 
---
I don't think i've ever heard such a good suggestion that would return the absolute amazing spur of activity to C6 space from 2012-2015 levels, if not surpass it
---
CCP's security is gone / is security theater and has been for a while. I and 3 other people from my corp all bounced out of eve at the same time via some pretty blatant RMT and nothing happened to our character shells (extracted to sell) nor the receivers of the ISK.
---
Note this was a few hundred $ worth each, directly from characters that had just sold everything and sold the SP, and transferred off the ISK.
---
There's a reason the game is 1/3 bots by online players.
---
Some people just need a reason to be unhappy in life and then to let everyone know that they are the victim. It gets a lot more attention than being happy and self-sufficient.
---
the people selling them for money probably did
---
No, they are just reacting like any normal person who doesn't have their head in the sand. Remember the grandma in Dante's peak? That's you! The sub is grieving the loss of their once beloved game whole old Dante grandma's keep saying "I aM hAvinG PHun so tHe gamE is sTIll gO0d!!"
---
I switched to regular reddit on mobile a year ago because it doesn't have the constant "OMG DOWNLOAD OUR APP" prompts.
---
I mean the fact that I understand about 2% of the words listed above is what make me worried about getting started in EVE. Wooooow.
---
Shut up retard idiot he's not some CCP Borg unit 
---
Why isn't Chess Boxing an Olympic Sport?
---
thats what a skillbook does...
---
do you play this game?
---
:omegablobsweat:
---
There's so much to learn and do for new players which gives the illusion of endless content.  
---
A year down the line you will begin to understand what people are talking about.
---
Yes, I catch your drift... my point is still valid... bitching constantly like so many posts here on Reddit only hurts the possibility that CCP actually listens and acts.. if they want to keep their money rolling in, they need to do whatever it takes to KEEP players coming and those already here, to stay... 
---
How does declaring the game dead and the devs clueless help "voices get heard by CCP"?
---
Totally agree that keeping silent is not the best way... but shitposting and blatantly insulting CCP... really?
---
I agree, there are some really simple changes to make game a looot better especially for vets and everyone like removing injectors, balance some ships (ffs changing few digits it's so hard that it takes months and months...).
---
FW need fixing, botting need fixing etc. it feels like CCP is intentionally killing game... but heyyy here You go, new gay skins... ffs
---
Ooh while we're at it lets get rid of skills, everyone just starts in Goonswarm with a fully fit Rorqual in Delve.
---
Lol,,, ok,, that is something I totally believe and understand!  :)
---
remind me when your nda expires?
---
I gotta set a reminder 
---
Are you a Master Bait-or?
---
Goodpost. Except the part about CCP Falcon not caring. He's a spectacular community advocate and doing his best to keep EVE true to its original vision with little support from management.
---
&gt; [Taking your ccp hat off for the moment...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/as995t/security_update_q1_2019/egsyafl/?context=1)
---
I wonder what happens if 200 ishtars rocking those skins land on a grid...framerates prolly drop to 5fps.
---
well.nope thanks.
---
Thats reversible from what I've heard.
---
Most people have come to terms with it and as a result they've quit or at least stopped putting effort into the game.. You don't see them posting on reddit because, well, they quit.
---
I will *make* it legal.
---
Um... what’s Near2?
---
i understand its hard for you to think that others aren't happy with the state of things and think it sucks seeing CCP and EVE in a sad state of affairs but its necessary that we can talk frankly and candidly like this.
---
I enjoyed salvaging as a new player. It was good isk, and tbh it is more engaging than most ratting.
---
Paging /u/tuz 
---
People might really hate this opinion but I actually hope they bring back WIS.
---
When they initially unveiled it and had that risk-like tabletop gaming thing I was pretty excited about it. Lots of cool things you could do with it too, eve-poker (the comeback) and stuff like that.
---
The gaming industry is in the dark ages. The golden age of innovation and challenge are over, greedy executives with no vision or passion have taken over. 
---
Ccp deserves to die
---
Speaking as one of the many people who watches what they seed to the test server's database via hoboleaks I can say there are more events coming. There is certainly something connected to the Drifters on the way, likely related to the Invasion word they keep using for the multiple fanfest locations this year. We will know more in March.

---
Always bet on stupid.
---
You use a real app and not the official one. Reddit is Fun is pretty good.
---
This sub? Every single eve discord, every one of my channels in game...the reality is the game has sucked for a couple years and the masses are just finally starting to wake up to what a few of us have been warning 
---
But are you ***GOTHIC INDUSTRIAL***?
---
Man, this has been going on for like 2 years. The isk/hour has to be abysmal.
---
&gt; It's more like speaking to a deaf audience. 
---
That is the feeling a lot of people reporting bots to CCP have too ... hmmm
---
Considering I've been in nullsec  systems with a 10 man gang but the 50 in local won't fight I think it's the other way round mate 
---
OP is supposed to be a joke but it's actually eerily accurate
---
I understand the point and the passion behind it but it isn't that bad
---
Yep, attributes offer literally nothing positive to the game.
---
It is just a newbro trap.
---
Onboarding and new player retention has *always* been an issue.
---
225 m^(3) per second, 810 000 m^(3) per hour. At average 250 isk per m^(3) of ore that is 200m isk per hour.
---
oh boy. were did i hurt you?
---
again, use ur tiny shrunken little pea brain...eve exists for 16 years now.
---
theres a LOT of dudes playing since day 1...plenty of those had their empires established over the years..and now be quietly in the background, treating this game as an economy simulator.
---
so if you moronic enough to not see the possibilitie of plenty of trillionaires existing in eve, and nobody gives a shit about it..then you are truly the braindead here.
---
and now go back to delve , put your head back into your rorquals arse...
---
people like you disgust me.
---
your view of eve must be very very narrowed if you cant even fathom the idea of multiple multi trillionaires in an SANDBOX player economy driven mmo running for 1 and a half decade now...
---
i bet when u read about games like entropia..and the real money generated by people over the years..your head will explode.
---
you are a prime example of a narrowminded eve krab. and im very very very sure...you are krabbing and or mining most of the time. would explain your blatantly ignorance / lack of knowledge ...
---
and now
---
go eat my poop ;)
---
Horseshit.  
---
There's plenty of companies out there trying out new shit and reinventing the wheel, blizzard with Hearthstone and Overwatch, a whole new fucking genre of games was born with Battle Royales, mobas are doing great, FF XIV and ESO are crushing it when it comes to MMOs, and WoW still stands, long hard dick in hand ect ect ect.
---
Your whole post is literally a lie trying to make excuses for CCP's incompetence, stop.
---
come back and read my post in two years. bookmark it and set it aside. it isn't meant for you. i dont expect you to understand. its okay.
---
I think I'd like to see this restricted just to Alpha skills - we don't need dread skills to be available on demand, IMO - but otherwise this is a very good change.
---
I think the excitement over the first week or two would be insane. I'd probably book it off work for it, people restarting corps and going up through frigs to cruisers, first battleship etc. 
---
It would definitely be a lot faster than the first time due to large ingrained groups like goons and test but it really would be a sight to behold. 
---
This format and style comes from 4chan where typing &gt; at the beginning of the line formats your text as a quote that happens to use a green font, hence the name.

lmao, what a moron you are 
---
only the bots who rmt the isk away are hitting on ccp wallets, the one who plex and extract sp to fund titans are only helping keep plex valuable and have "players" logged in, in the statistics.
---
Ratting bots don't even use Ishtars, because the omega lock. 
---
How far the game has fallen. 
---
To be fair, the one from 2018 has a link to a dev blog, which means they already had changes in mind, so they could be more specific.
---
The one for 2019 is very vague because the "balance team" likely hasn't even started thinking about it yet.
---
Can you share a rolling dread fit?
---
Misery loves company. 
---
/r/Eve should not be used as any reliable source as the player base for Eve. 
---
This sub is here for the toxic players to vent. 
---
Anything beyond that should only be taken for strictly entertainment value.

i don't want to admit we have bads in our playerbase.

What if someone else had already imported it, and it was a few percent cheaper?
---
Gambling in EVE is never coming back due to the legalities. I enjoyed it too but its gone forever.
---
you would know how it tastes i guess 
---
I agree with you for all of the "expansions" not much has changed other than citadels which is 2 years old now or Abyssal space which is nice but a pretty niche area of the game. The lack of progress on anything is what has become so frustrating as a long time player.

Drakes were popular towards the end of that run, but yeah you could make your game time in a 4-6 hour period. Faster if you hunted where arbalsest siege launchers dropped
---
Already replaced? :D
---
While I agree that this sub's purpose includes a place for toxicity to spew forth like alpha strikes, it is also a place that some people use before they decide whether or not the play the game... 
---
If I were remotely interested in trying the game and came here to get some insight, I would never waste my time to download it because "it is dead and/or dying"...

We should just incrementally remove every aspect that made Eve interesting until we're left with Wow

So... Injectors then?
---
fuck you ccp, i dont wanna spend money on this game 
---
Right now I’m pretty sure the profit margins are negative unless you’re also using those accounts for PI
---
I've bought and fitted battleships to save myself a 10 jump round trip. Travel is a necessary mechanic but it's as fun as watching dried paint when it's to collect something easily replaceable. 
---
'Innocent until proven guilty', is okay in my book.   
---
What makes a bot guilty, though is the real question.
---
But... is there even a Permaband anymore?
---
Love it.  
---
Have you tried google maps
---
It's something like 1.3 -1.5 m sp a month. Moral of the story is you barley break even so it's basically a free omega if you do it right.
---
I'm not going to put a lot of effort into refuting you because most of the changes you mention occurred in 2017. It took CCP 6 months from then to release 2 new structures with no timeline on the remaining upwell structures being released. NPC Sotiyos are abandoned content which CCP can't even put the effort in to finish for the other factions. Every other "life improvement" have been minor UI changes with no balance passes since the battleship one almost a year ago.
---
There is. One of the singers no longer is a dev for CCP but still "tours" with Permaband at events.
---
It was unfit which suggest that it was anchoring. It's common practice to initially anchor structures in a neutral holding corp then transfer them to the real owning corp once they're armed and online. It can also remain neutral and the ACL can be configured to allow arbitrary access. In a warzone, any Fortizar of questionable ownership is a potential beachhead for a capital army and thus a prime target for destruction.
---
&gt; It's a monumental software development undertaking
---
we've all known this for years, which is why most of us were very surprised to see it on the list for early 2019, and aren't at all surprised that it's been delayed. CCP had told us repeatedly that it would take years to complete and never said they'd started it, it just magically appeared on their agenda 6-months out.
---
While a good change, this is totally going to butcher the skillbook trading market.  Unless skills on demand prices are insanely higher (which I doubt), next to nobody is going to be manually buying them to save some pennies.  
---
With a change to a system this big after 15 years, I think the fair thing to do would be to allow any currently stockpiled skillbooks to be converted back to their isk price.  Trying to offload stocks is going to be incredibly painful after this change.
---
Would you rather they wasted time rewording it?
---
If you're gating through hs in a jf at all you're doing it wrong. I'm not arguing against your point, just providing context why it's dumb to move a jf through hs.... Not always having an exit cyno from every hs system is a stupid risk you don't need to take
---
i'm assuming you are retarded and regularly eat your own poop, why would you even think about something like that otherwise 
---
No, I'm a goon and goons are too pro for google maps
---
Injecting into a Titan is not part of a typical players ship progression. I for one have no interest in supers and barley any interest in caps in general. Once I've completed bs down I will then consider a dread or carrier.

Pros:
---
Reliable. 100% uptime guarantee.
---
Not being datamined by those evil NSA-like wormhole corps.
---
Zero incidents where obscure holidays exclusive to the developers region are plastered on the tool.
---
One less tab in your browser. Leaves more room for furry porn.
---
Cons:
---
Some artistic ability required
---
Some wormholes eat the crayon, and then realize that they cannot map anything else.
---
Fucking climate change messing with the seasons is all... nothing to see move on and undock
---
RIP Thera scanning with 118 new incoming wormhole signatures. 
---
The people reselling the amarr frigate skill at a 4000% markup can literally go fuck themselves, and move on to reselling the non-core skills to lazy fucks like me, as those skills will not be a part of this.
---
Remember kids, EVE is fun!

C6s are supposed to be extra-isolated. C2s and C4s having dual statics facilitates more wormhole activity.

---
&gt; How about doing/saying something positive if you are still playing
---
then ccp need to give us something positive to talk about.
---
vOv
---
I played EVE a fair amount back in the Rubicon days. I returned recently on a new machine to find my Overview gone - I legit had no idea what to even do at that point. It didnt help that I didnt have a link to use.
---
Is there a specific Explorer/Salvage overview? I like running cleanup on battle sites and cracking Explorer sites, but the Overviews I have seen seem to focus on PVP specifically. 
---
Just use Tripwire. It sucks the least.
---
the CCP we need
---
To be fair, most of the things you mentioned are potentially very positive changes;
---
 * 64 bit client - Better access to system resources and less crashy in big fights. (maybe)
---
 * War Dec changes - An insane amount of new players are pushed out of the game with the current war dec system, changing it can only be a good thing.
---
 * Security counter measures - Botting is bad for the game, countering it is a good thing.
---
 * Activity tracker - Good for new players, might help them stick around longer. More players == good for game.
---
 * Agency redesign - Don't know, never used it. 
---
Also remember this, each one of these changes has been done at the request of players who begged and pleaded for them here on /r/Eve, various Fanfests/meetups, and on the forums.
---
However, to keep everyone happy, CCP really needs to do all these things AND balance passes and the usual continual roll out of new features.
---
Welllllll... lol,,, let's continue to hope they are indeed working on that!  :)
---
I bitch about this game, because I keep trying other games, and they keep sucking. Eve is the only MMO I’ve ever gotten excited about. The last game I got excited about, in general, was Halo 3.
---
There is nowhere else to go. All other games might as well be FarmVille, for all I care about them.
---
Have you ever undocked a sub in the last year? Also being in a fleet of 500 doesn't count.
---
Wasn't fair they didn't have their 80000 titans. 
---
Tbh I'd buy that. And I'm probably not a bot
---
Why not
---
Haven‘t played since 2016. I was in Pandemic Horde in and around our ratting pocket in C4C, GME-PQ. Now PH has left that area, I got kicked from PH for inactivity in 2017 and I have assets worth around 3 billion ISK still there.
---
How can I get my assets out or sell them from far away? I got teleported to my faction home system and I don‘t know how to return since all the structures that were there are gone.
---
That's not how goonswarm works. You must merely exist. 
---
probably not*
---
True. There is an easy way to do that. Actually start fixing things that have be known as broken for 1 year or more and make an alliance tournament. Then you can convert back anger from people that stopped playing the game but still come to Reddit into subscription money from returning players and friends they recruit instead of discouraging them. 
---
They look at init channels chat logs so when someone posts a system near you. It yells at you.
---
Bittervets will be bitter.  Except these are new wave bittervets, who aren't fun
---
You know you already get an aggro timer when you shoot on something, not just when it shoots back? Where am I here, anyone in this thread actually has a clue what he is talking about ?
---
I'm ashamed that I enjoyed this so much.
---
I have no idea dude he is crazy 
---
Ohhhh boy... Nice!!! xD
---
Hello I am gameplay.
---
Oh. So they are cheating. As always.
---
And you are not capable understanding simple facts .... tfw
---
but he still en't wrong. 
---
Exactly... you keep trying other games and keep coming right back... as bad as it is, as dead or dying that it is, as flawed... 
---
Actually love your point!
---
How hard is it to look at what ships are being used disproportionately more or less than the others, and make a tiny change like +2% to MWD bonus per level? Something small that won't make the ship completely broken or worthless, but would help bring it in line with other ships?
---
I wish CCP developed their own bots...
---
NPC null has been like this forever and has been fairly dynamic over the years
---
Are you so sure?
---
you forgot 24/7 rorqual shield for free without DT.
---
I actually would buy that but thats another point for another day.
---
If you have to tell me how to play to game to make your point valid you are proving my point. The game isn't all shit, some aspects I know little about probably are broken, even I can see that roaming lowsec in a frigate infrequently. I do own a Phoenix and never used it since I got it, because I don't like big toys.
---
There is a lot of fun shit to do in this game and what this sub is doing is way beyond constructive criticism. At this point it's nothing more than a prophecy of a dying game and it becomes selffulfilling. 
---
Jesus thats an ugly skin. 
---
Not going to happen, pointless to even discuss it. A better question would be: when was the last time you felt the game was doing good? ie: if you were to rollback the server, at what point of Eve history would you rollback it and why?
---
Snap, going to have to upgrade from my VNI now...
---
sorry mislinked my answer to you
---
Sounds like you look at yourself plenty.
---
When did dscan work differently than it does today?
---
Nibba I hate CCP as much as the next guy but piglegrio is probably the only REAL nibba at CCP who bans bots as his day job
---
Honestly, when they release things when they're "ready", they tend to never get released (logi on killmails CCPlease).
---
Even citadels, which were launched "when they were ready" weren't ready when they were launched.
---
That's nice but not what the original post or the comment I was replying to was about.
---
\&gt;mfw you don't have a reasonable response to my point so you write a couple paragraphs about a tangential topic that I never mentioned.
---
Yes but adding mining to it has created another activity that doesn't compete with ratters allowing even more density
---
Right, goons have their own tools - for example for wormhole mapping.    
---
https://pathfinder.goonfleet.com/
---
&gt; Agency redesign - Don't know, never used it.
---
They are on their 3rd re-design of the agency window, and I don't even know what the fuck it does or why I would want to use it.
---
This information coming from someone with Test flare seems dubious at best. 
---
Hey hey your body has to be warm and your pc needs to be able to run the mandatory botting package that comes with every membership.
---
So... can I have your stuff?
---
A week or 2 ago I felt for the first time like not logging into eve like at all.. After some thought I realized that all I am doing is waiting for div2 and crowfall and eve doesn't matter to me anymore as it did a year ago... It just became so pointless to log in... 
---
Gigabrain: Everyone adopts the mcav enyo to optimally move around chains at max speed with low mass and rorqs learn to fear the enyo swarm
---
By far the most obvious scam in Eve.
---
What exactly is interesting about the attributes and remap system?
---
And at the people in our community we build up over 12 years spanning multiple nationalities, ingame factions &amp; groups that all lounge on our discord(s). I have no problem that Delve plays a different style, I just have a problem when people stupidly complain about issues their playstyle is the reason for ...
---
Do you really exist if you dont have those things?
---
&gt; As part of the rollout of these changes, we’ll also be looking at the base price of all skills.
---
Amarr Titan - 40B
---
how many of those companies has also failed to produce more than one successful product in their history?  
---
Me too
---
&gt;CCP isn't bold anymore is the problem.
---
Incarna was the last truly bold EVE expansion, CMV.
---
Major League Bots. FTFY. 
---
Assuming everyone is looking in the direction of the boss, just turn the camera 45°, make your character run forward (right click on front of you, auto-run hotkey, whatever WoW does), alt-tab, repeat with a higher camera angle. That would work on the few MMOs I've played at least.
---
*concern*
---
What do you mean? Pretty sure all they did was add a keyboard shortcut so that we wouldn't have to move the mouse away from whatever we're doing every 2 seconds to click the button. And the D-scan cone is pretty much only useful when triangulating the location of cargo containers in space, which is too autistic task for most people. And the feature to dscan anoms by shiftclicking on them only works it the system map is open, and the map closes every time you dock, so it's fairly useless.  
---
If anything they nerfed it, removing the checkbox for quickly swapping between current overview and the preset, and setting the minimum distance on dscan slider to something useless instead of maybe 100k-1mkm.
---
Those are nice skins. now, lets see what price point they put them at.
---
then i'll tell you how excited i am about them.
---
Progod said theres no bots in test space leadership wouldn't lie to me. Only steal members auth passwords and other unethical things. 
---
Then do something about it. 
---
Report your bots. Awox them. Feed intel or disrupt theirs. 
---
Maybe the game shouldn't be made so that the highest reward method also has very low risk?
---
tl;dr Eve is dying? Pearl Abyss paid a lot of money for CCP and the cash money grub bullshit like skins and injectors etc. were already in the game when they were bought by PA. They can't squeeze the player base enough to profit off CCP with what was already in the game so CCP will have to continue to improve the game and add content.   
---
Been playing since 07, the game is further from dead than at some points I can remember.
---
old theme best theme
---
1. This is not the way to look for a corp.
---
2. This is not the way to apply to a Thera based corp. Most of them are invite-only.
---
Yet rorquals still dwarfed by IWIN isk gambling 
---
No. It's not /technically/ cheating so its goons as always. 
---
I feel like the transition to bittervet lies around the point where you get bored with your current place in-game, start looking at other areas of space for a breath of fresh air, and start recognizing patterns and realize that almost the whole game is the same few flawed systems strung together with different paint.
---
Great systems they are, but the same problems and lack of iteration are scattered everywhere from years of similar abandoned projects.  And problems created or left unpatched in one area feel like they propagate across the entire game.
---
tell this goons not me lol, i gues you mis adressed your post, as I agree 100%
---
By undocking a sub i mean experiencing the cancer that is capitals online
---
EvilHuntz pls.
---
Yes, but it is still a social game. I’m not going to keep playing it if my friends aren’t.
---
“Dead comms kill [small] corps.”
---
And they did get back to spaceships
---
Just keep the bots running with Teamviewer when you're off on vacation
---
I'm not cool enough to be in the awox group though :-(
---
Users must be trained to accept the unlocking so it is easier for them to accept when items can only be bought in the store.
---
I have no idea how asset safety works
---
What a surprise!
---
I think that deserves an applause. 
---
I love the Abyssal Space, not to mention Upwell structures have been great. I see a lot of posts on Reddit about how people feel EVE has stagnated, I recommend reminding yourself what EVE looked like back in 2012. May be if you feel the game has stagnated you just need a break and I'm sure if you come back in 12 months you will be having to get back up to speed with all the changes. 
---
look up overview packs, z-s and sarashawa(sp?) are two big ones
---
are you also match my search?
---
just get like 100 titans boson ratting
---
Are you emergent though?
---
Yea. CCPlease stop making sensible changes. You're robing us of the chance to bitch at you. It's outrageous! 
---
You have put into words what i've been feeling for a few years now.
---
I can now rest in peace ( in-game ).
---
Lol yes misleading title. This'll actually remove the burden of handing out free skillbook packs to newbies who come to null.
---
wait what, how far? Can I be 30 jumps out from jita, buy a skill injector with my alt, contract it over to my main, and inject through the assets menu?
---

Eve would never have been as big as it could be because it's too broad and difficult.  There's a reason popular MMOs got simpler as time went on.  UO-&gt;EQ-&gt;DAoC-&gt;WoW was a progression of difficult near anarchy(like EVE) to tightly controlled user experience with easy progression and few risks to your player character.  Every subsequent game borrowed the best bits and discarded worse bits, and each subsequent game became more successful.
---
Would still buy from the character sheet, because i can't be bothered to check every time to save like 10 mil. 
---
Wow reading the title then the article was a roller coaster of emotion and tension.   
---
I don't need that right now goddamn. 
---
Winner of who can sell the uglies item to eve players goes to.....
---
just head in there and ask in local
---
fuck off Frat alt
---
What a scam, it doesn't even come with 3 months invulnerability.
---
120%
---
Fuck, it's true that citadel was two years ago and we still haven't seen the "small" citadels supposed to replace mobile depots. Nor most of the structures shown at whatever fanfest Citadel was revealed.
---
Yes,,, and how does that happen... players leave, new potential players are dissuaded/discouraged because they decided to do some research on Reddit and found the game is dying and decide, "No thanks"... 
---
Anyone who actually gave this tard money deserves to be scammed.
---
attributes are interesting?
---
Man, you’re a shitposter yourself who got immensely trolled. You jelly or what. 
---
Yes because they don't have the financial capacity to do both and are not currently doing it ?
---
Its sad trying to milk people by selling a product based on an awesome band they effectively killed due to piss poor decisions.
---
Exploration in lower sec areas. You can get started with very few SP and a super cheap T1 exploration frigate, if you can make it into a wormhole or into lowsec and back out with some loot you can make a lot of isk very fast.
---
With a cheap T1 frig you only really need to make it back with one decent load to pay for it dozens of times over.
---
Yup
---
&gt; playerbase will stay loyal and also invest
---
No, we'll stay because there's nowhere else to go for the same enjoyment we get out of EVE *occasionally*. 
---
why have you resurrected these demons
---
I laughed, I laughed good.
---
Look through your assets for an asset safety wrap in a lowsec station. You'll have to fly there and pay 10% of its value to regain access. Then you can firesale it and/or arrange to have it shipped elsewhere via private courier.
---
Finally!
---
“Mansplaining” ffs do you retards ever have an original thought?
---
Everyone will tell you to join a big nullsec corp because that's where the money is at. A 1 day old super autistic player can make a billion in a day but it's not fun but you can use that isk to have fun. And by fun I mean explosions. 
---
I like incursions, fleet pve, you can make some good isk with those and the loyalty points they give you. Look into public incursion groups and see what fits they recommend. It's a good introduction to flying in a fleet too.
---
Dude, there is so much shit thats more or less working as intended. Sure its enoying to get blobbed by caps, but my alliances members have a lot of fun flying bomber fleets blowing up shit (as can be seen on internal forums), I really like the highsec brawls we are having in high sec in a non set meta (Ferox, Canes, Maels, Abaddons, Leshaks, TFIs), Incursions are fine, exploration is fun, rated and not rated DED sites are cool, project discovery is interesting, there is a lot of stuff in developement related to AI I'm really excited about. You dont have to do any of this 24/7. If you are bored of one thing do another, become a casual player if you get bored after playing the game for 10 years. Thats fine. A lot of stuff needs to be worked on but we are nowhere near the point where CCP fucked it all up. There is a lot in this game that people can find joy in but wont because they probably wont give this game a try checking out this subreddit. If only this sub was working on a vision in absence of CCP's own (according to this subreddit)  - that'd be something I could get behind.
---
we all have our weaknesses
---
Maybe stop bitching about things you choose to read on your own?
---
People is entitled to complain about the (lack of) direction the game is taking because most of them have invested a lot in it and this community and feel betrayed or robbed by CCP because of their latest (lack of) actions.
---
This is a public forum and most of the complains voiced here by the community have been heard by CCP, some even lead to development changes, balance passes and whatnot, while others of course have been diregaeded as authistic screeching (correctly most of the time)... so there goes your futility argument out the window.
---
If you enjoy the game and don't like to read people comments saying they don't, just stop reading r/eve. Far more effective than white knighting CCP and bitching about people bitching.
---
REEEE EXPLOITTTT REEEE another Mar5hy alt detected
---
I can’t you’ll have to describe it for me 
---
What would you consider lower sec areas? And what types of things make you the money? I think exploration can lead to ratting sites / salvaging sites / mining sites. So how would you set up your frig to handle all of those? Id love to do this as it sounds pretty fun.
---
you mean like the board game 
---
Idk if I'd call the runner of the scam a tard. He seemed to put some pretty decent effort into keeping it going. 
---
Updates, duh. Lol.
---
Jeez you call half of eve to defend your own shit (which is all you've ever done) and still have the nerve to complain when we batphone one other alliance? Is the love potion wearing off yet?
---
Grr goonz 
---
Pretty sure all that isk being spent to mass inject == good for CCP.
---
Hahahahaha
---
You are exceedingly late to the game. The market is saturated and margins are so thin right now that you need to be able to buy PLEX six months in advance to turn a thin profit. 
---
wow so shocked i can't believe he's done this
---
Tripwire. 
---
EVE will continue to go down this part as long as the mass of people who are unhappy continue to log in. 
---
Ever since I started playing the game I was (negatively) amazed at how many people play this game while having rarely anything good to say about it. The amount of bitterness was sheer incredible and that was several years ago, long before the PA acquisation. For some reason that I can't fathom, players seem to become unironically content with suffering addiction to a game they don't (anymore?) love or even like.
---
It's almost as if the meta game is a competition in who can more vigorously do something they hate.
---
You are literally just crying about the same thing all the other inactive pilots complain about each time an update comes out. 
---
I stand corrected. Thank you.
---
I have been saying PI should be an RTS game
---
&gt; No. You will get two mobile games and you will like it
---
I really don’t give a shit about newbros. I just want my friends to keep having a reason to log in and play with me. vOv

---
useless camper XD
---
Quite optimistic, aren't we?
---
For many with an army of alts it is already an RTS.
---
And probably the longest one aswell... I'm glad it's over, the moron that ran it was fucking annoying.
---
&gt; All they are doing now is focusing squarely on microtransactions and the new eden store 
---
I disagree with you. They are focusing on multi account whales, Rorquals, VNI ratting, Super ratting. And not just are focusing, but have been focusing for a very longtime now. Sure, there are some changes here and there, but they're crappy, have less devs on them etc. Take for example the latest Guardian Gala event. And most of all, the whale system is pretty much complete, so it isn't so much that they need to develop or change it, but rather so they need to make sure that they don't touch it, the key now is to preserve it at the cost of fuck everyone else.
---
The microtransactions are a drop in the ocean when compared to whale income. It does add a little bit, but no where near what it needs to, New Eden simply doesn't have enough skin interested players when it comes down to it.
---
Any no brainers such as cap rebalance, PVE encounters rebalance, mining or Rorq rebalance or any ship rebalance that might affect whales, is automatically disgarded and ignored.
---
It might slow them down a bit, but it won't in fact do enough. No amount of reporting will be enough. No amount of awoxing will be enough. Given EVE general game mechanics, it may also not be immediately clear who is a bot unless the bot breaks or the owner just doesn't give a fuck about trying to appear "normal".  
---
What CCP needs to do is what Blizzard did: [https://youtu.be/WqT8JV1sul8?t=59](https://youtu.be/WqT8JV1sul8?t=59)
---
and being presented with the glowing pride of someone who just solved a really difficult problem
---
You mean like Sins of a Solar Empire?
---
I think you just have a hard on for goons cause I was litteraly laughing and making fun of this post saying it's stupid as hell to cry about it.. yet you are writing me books about how it's stupid to cry about it..
---
Like your coalition’s sense of autonomy?
---
Yeah I mostly agree with your above points. For the small gang bit I can testify that roaming/small gang in nullsec is essentially dead, and if you do it, it is more of a display of masochism. All there is to do is shoot invulnurable rorqs, frag VNIs or eat shit to just about every cap owner in nullsec. Cant say much about lowsec because im mostly nullsec smallgang, fc or wormholer btw.
---
[CCP Peligro will remember that.]
---
he wasn't wrong, also it's been handled http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Blood_Wolf_Team_Wolf_Blood/alliances
---
What are the best places to find corps like that. I'm not opposed to quick cash as Id expect I will lose a handful of ships as I learn the ropes. Learning Fleet PVE would be great as well. Where do you find public incursion groups, is it just a matter of asking in chat or is there a discord or something. 
---
You mean card game ?
---
Have you actually tried the Agency though?
---
/s
---
With the new skillbook changes, is there any word on which skills will no longer be available for fixed price?
---
Also what is the best move here for capitalizing on a pile of skillbooks?
---
*buys as many cap books as possible*
---
Trying something just for the sake of trying something is not a benefit.  The changes take time and effort away from other features, and frequently make the game worse for human players while having no effect on bots beyond a version bump.
---
That doesn't mean you should do nothing about bots.  What it means is you can't do it through game mechanics.  You have to do it through behavior.  Such as a human can't play 23.5/7.
---
We ping for fleet.... But you run away 
---
WHy fuck up one game when you can fuck up two? Go for it.
---
And you just exploded next to healer, killing him
---
i think the COSMOS skills , ying ling or what ever , salvaging drones and astronomic engineering
---
Eve lingo is wild. It took me months to be able to understand most of the posts on /r/eve - not just because of the terminology, but because of the in-jokes and the labyrinthine alliance politics in this game. For some people, internet spaceships are *very serious business*.
---
Isn't that the opposite of preserving niche gameplay though? If I understand correctly, there isn't going to be any skill trading on remote markets anymore, because everybody can just do it from the character sheet.
---
You need a ping for 50 people to take on 10?
---
https://i.redd.it/esyp02tp6ui21.jpg
---
3 big ones:
---
Siggy, Pathfinder, Tripwire
---
So....is this not a good time to get in to EVE?
---
PI should be a Factorio minigame     
---
^(0.17 released today!)
---
make it extra static, like it never despawns, drop fortizar with PDS at  0 on the hole :)
---
Dumbing EVE down. Next to come: "New players have difficulty finding the ISK to buy the skills from their character sheet, so after careful consideration with the C$M we decided to introduce a cash payment option"
---
The movement pattern observation thing I think might work for most, but unfortunately, Eve Online has a large percentage of autism among its playerbase. It will not work due to false positives. For example, when I run stuff in more serious mode, I use same tactics, same approach, etc. for same type of sites once I find one that works for me the best.
---
The otehr 2 would work great, I was actually thinking further on having an NPC rat in memory only, but not in the game, make this rat not shoot or do anything, just kinda be there and maybe orbit something. A memory reading bot will try to lock onto it, but won't be able to because it will be in memory only but not overview or D-Scan or even visible to select on screen.
---
This would essentially break any bots relying on memory only.
---
And you are right, if a bot even tries to target a rat that is in memory only instead of actually fully in the game, we will know right away that it is a bot and not human.
---
And yes, there is no way to get rid of them all, but there are multitudes of things that can be done which in their sum total, can bring them to manageble levels, that ought to be done, but aren't.
---
The game is basically unplayable with the default overviews. 
---
so what was the total haul?
---
In before 15 plex micro transactions for skills 
---
Me? Nothing. I run marathons.
---
In all my time in goons ivw never heard anyone say fuck yea im elite unironicly
---
It's funny seeing everybody here happy, and everybody on the main forums losing their minds. LOL
---
This is the kind of quality I expect from a delivery company.
---
I love it how they went from, player built stargates, to, lol j/k it's just re-flavoured jump bridges.
---
There was another post basically complaining why everything should be so complex with EVE, wanted attributes axed as well.
---
I tried getting into EVE several times since 2007. I didn't feel the satisfaction of the game until I actually forced myself to tab out and search the wide web for guides and explanations of the mechanics. This is a game that demands more of you and if you can't pull it, go play WoW. 
---
I prefer tripwire, but I would say try the big three and go with whatever fits your style
---
If you hate clicking, want your chains to display without scrolling, and want a undo button tripwire is the best.
---
Volta and Beach Boys 
---
We've brought this up in every summit. 
---
WTB /r/eve contest for brightest crayon in a box  
---
They really need to remove local. But now that it is know how goons use it to automate near botting like behavior, no wonder there is pushback from them.

The security status of the systems are listed in the upper left hand corner. they are numbers ranging from +1.0 to +0.5 for hisec, +0.4 to +0.1 for lowsec, 0.0 to -1.0 for nullsec, and -1.0 always for wormholes.
---
In hisec the sites are worth the least. Combat sites will be much easier and its good place to learn how the mechanics of different sites work but the payouts are really low. In exchange for this if anyone attacks you they will be killed by concord. 
---
In lowsec there is no concord. Gate and station guns will still shoot at people who have criminal timers (people who attacked you) but probably won't kill your attacker. In exchange for this lack of protection the site payouts are much higher and the sites are much tougher to run.
---
In nullsec its much the same except there aren't any gate and station guns. The sites pay out even better and are even harder than lowsec. There are additional dangers, warp disruption bubbles can pull you out of warp and directly into the waiting hands of people looking to kill you. Interdictors can put up bubbles that prevent you from warping away from gates as well.
---
Wormholes are like nullsec but you can get to them by scanning down a wormhole anywhere even in hisec, but keep in mind that if you go into a hisec wormhole there are probably people watching the inside waiting for you to come through so they can catch and kill you.
---
And running hacking sites (data/relic) and combat sites generally won't be done with the same ship, you could try it tho if you wanted to. I would reccomend trying the Imicus cus it can fit the most drones. Otherwise you'd probably want a combat ship and a scanning ship separate. Scan down a combat site with your Imicus and warp in your Thorax or Catalyst to actually run the site.
---
Drunk at 10am. So, doing very well, as you can tell.
---
TBF it is not like i paid for it, so yolooooooooooooo
---
Who is in charge of this sensible change?
---
Stop rushing me, making mistakes as fast as I can.
---
That list is too short.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP\_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

Well this is game after, with small population - you cannot scam constantly scam new people like Star Citizen is doing

---
Okay.
---
Yeah, I hope they consider faction-based skills. There was a fun world-building moment as a new player when I realized I couldn’t buy Amarr ship skills from Minmatar space and had to fly over there.  And if players can buy Capital skills on demand, that basically takes the fun out of expensive killmails where some poor aspiring capital pilot doesn’t get his books when the delivery ship goes missing.
---
Depends on goals and alpha/omega status.
---
If your goal is pvp, it's worth doing mostly 1 race frig/dessie skills and support skills first. You get the most immediate payback. Then you either go wide and broaden to other races or go up to cruiser/bc of your chosen race and, eventually, maybe BS for that race.
---
If your goal is safe pve, then the current meta is to go gallente cruiser and drone skills, get into a Vexor Navy, if safe enough go into a Gila, then a Rattlesnake or a Carrier.
---
If the goal is building stuff or to do trading you don't need to fly anything and you basically cannot be an alpha.
---
If the goal is hauling (which is really for an alt) it's industrial -&gt; t2 industrial -&gt; freighter -&gt; jump freighter (only in null/low). Alphas basically can't do this.
---
If the goal is mining it looks like the meta is orca -&gt; rorqual (only with access to null). Almost useless to mine if you're alpha.
---
What I imagine it's like being CCP Falcon reading r/eve https://youtu.be/FGA2-ghB_yo
---
The default is too inconsistent and misleading.  You can't approach it with zero-knowledge of what is what.
---
The colours red and yellow are not used logically.  Then there is inappropriate use of flashing which causes panic when none is justified.  Flashing background is also distracting when sharp focus is required.
---
Criminals, low security, outlaws, kill-rights, and suspects, are not immediate threats.  They are targets of opportunity.
---
Recommendations:
---
Same corp (safe) = green background.
---
If it is an immediate threat (danger = war targets, limited engagement, opposing faction), it should be red background if not in same fleet or alliance.
---
If it is a possible threat (warning = everything not otherwise marked), it should be yellow background.
---
If it requires attention (criminal, outlaw, kill-right, suspect), flashing on the icon and not the background is sufficient to draw attention.
---
Best Friends = dark blue background (alliance, excellent standing).
---
Friends = blue background (same faction, good standing, assisting in war)
---
Low standing / enemies:  orange background.
---

Absolutely awful, fuck me.

This actually sounds like a solid change. Nicely done

To take had me scared for a minute though, not gunna lie. 
---
Yeah, supers can occasionally miss AB frigs
---
Clearly needs to get fixed
---
I pulled up alongside it, rolled down my window, and screamed that Burn Jita was going on, but he couldn't hear me over everyone's warp drives. God rest his soul.

I forgot to mention I left. Sorry.
---
I guess no toolerino for me ;)
---
it's just a lot of drama guy's XD
---
100000000000000% agree. It is completely unreasonable to expect a new player, or even frankly most veterans, to be able to create a decent set of overviews. It is not an especially user friendly process and it's absolutely game breaking to not have a good set of them. 
---
Big shout outs to Ohtaka in PL or the guy who does the z-s overview packs for making this game playable.
---
If anything though, CCP should completely remove the current overview system and replace it with something that doesn't even remotely resemble the current system, because it legitimately is awful.
---
If anyone is even remotely suprised by this, they're tapped in the head... 
---
Pfff, not sure who invited Enyobrain.
---
Assuming the mass is the same 3.3b as current c6-null wormholes, you can fit 300 Drekavacs through one with a minimum mass roll on the variation.
---
Or, you know, 2200 Kikimoras ...
---
Maybe you should recruit more good posters, wait
---
more density is good and was the goal
---
It's not at all cheating. And from what I understand most alliances suggest their line members to use something similar. It doesn't look at who is in local it looks at intel reported by other people on alliance intel channels.
---

If I read the article correctly I believe it implies you can without outright saying it in words.
---
They canceled fanfest because the only convention center in Iceland that is big enough to hold it is being remodeled.
---
Damn evil CCP and their....refusal to hold a convention in a construction zone!!!
---
Btw, they're also holding several mini-fanfests around the world as a poor man's replacement.
---
It's almost like they were trying to clean up their own bed after shitting it. Still scrubbing on those chat stains, I think.
---
you did a misspell 
---
You forgot some rorqual and super that i drop man, the only interesting part :) 
---
Is PVP possible without first skilling lightly into PVE ships? I haven’t found a sustainable way of conducting PVP that doesn’t involve tanking freighters and miners. 
---
Yup my accounts have mostly all lapsed and I haven't logged in, in a week. Much like WoW died for me a year ago, I see the same thing in Eve. Why struggle to eke out fun in a game that's transitioned away from its core values to profit from an anti-PVP playstyle. But I will thank the game for one thing- made a lot of good friends from all over the world.
---
bad bo... wait a minute?
---
F?
---
You're kidding, right?
---
EVE is all about exploiting the edge cases to make a ship just a tiny bit better.  Change a number and you get a cascade of interactions resulting in large-scale changes.
---
Also, changing the meta every month is going to seriously piss off the playerbase as they just "wasted" a month skilling into a now-useless ship.
---
I couldnt here you over the sound you make rimming your goon buddies.
---
Sooooo... Can I have your stuff?
---
with 10% extra discount for kids with guns, test and goons
---
Honk for respects.
---
Exploration hands down the best for newbies, as a newbro myself I can give you some advices, when you explore set yourself a goal for example every 50-100mil store your loot in a nearby station in case you get ganked so you don’t lose it all, always use your d scan to see if there’s anyone nearby and lastly look up which faction’s sites are most profitable and go for them..
---
Its intent is to make one actually plan for what to train and focus on the long-term of that. It's very much in keeping with the original core Eve ethos - make decision carefully and accept any consequences (or advantages) it confers.
---
check out https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/ for corps listing for new players. 
---
There are also a lot of newbie corps out there, Pandemic Horde and Brave being some of the biggest ones.

I will link their websites/reddits below and hopefully you can get all you need to  know from there.

PVE is heavy on the pirate or faction ships, combination of great bonuses and low skill overhead vs. T2 ships. Also drones are currently very popular for PVE and Vexor Navy Issue and Gila are the best cruiser sized drone ships by a very large margin.
---
I am find you are looking for
---
someone please explain why this change is good?
---
seems like more dumbing the game down, now skill trading will be fucked
---
So how many does it takes for you to be mouthful considering their size :) 
---
I mine a large sum of things in Immensea. You should definitely bring your Rorqual down there and do some mining.
---
autbot mk IV (Eve wetware) v1
---
Yeah man, I've seen those grazing shots and that just shouldn't happen, every shot should at least be a hit
---
I look forward to your plethora of evidence.
---
Why does Eve have to be compliant with stuff like 800x600 ? Its not 2003 anymore. Games all over the place, even the long lasting ones raise their system reqs on regular basis.
---
All this sort of stuff does is make it easier for the bots so they can run more clients per machine. We're in fucking 2019 FFS, 1080p should be absolute bare minimum.
---
Trying something because it might slow down the bot takeover for a while is a benefit, sorry. And what other features are we missing out on, where all we need is the security team to implement some changes. 
---
lol I might even buy it
---
I mean the bigger issue is you can pick the doctrine for the alpha's after the hostile fleet shows up, as you can then inject into w/e and source your ships from members there spare ships. 
---
It's like a massive utility increase without having to do the absolutely boring job of maintaining a large collection of skill books for everyone to inject from.  
---
This topic is going to be pure guesswork until the changes start appearing on Sisi.
---
For your first question, it's probably likely that most of the skills up to rank 3 will be affected, as well as select rank 4 (Tactical Shield Manipulation, Acceleration Control, and Missile Projection, for instance) and a few rank 5 (BS weapons) skills. And a few of higher rank might come into play (the racial BS skills, for example, are rank 8). Other than this, though, it's unlikely that rank 6 and above skills would be affected, and it's possible that select lower rank skills might not be affected (Subsystem skills, for example).
---
For your second question, it's a pretty good bet that most or all of the cheapest skill books will become more expensive. For example, at 80K, a skill like Shield Emission Systems (Rank 2) seems absurdly under-priced (ditto the two equivalent Armor skills, plus Capacitor Emissions). And this extends will up the skill ranks. Drone Durability (Rank 5) at 50K is another prime example of an under-priced book, and a fair number of the Electronics skills are likewise under-priced for when players actually start to use them. It's also likely that the lowest-cost books (Mechanics, for example) will also come up.
---
That said, a few books here and there are likely to come down in price. Thermodynamics always struck me as being wildly over-priced, as did Infomorph Psychology (one of the most expensive Rank 1 books outside of Subsystems, at 1.0M).
---
If you were looking to make ISK out of this, your best bet would probably be the side books that are 100% utilized by players but tend to be neglected in terms of skill give-aways. Stuff like the middle tier Navigation books, the specific resistance and emissions books for Shields and Armor, the support skills in Gunnery, Missiles, and Drones, and the e-war and tackling skills in Electronic Systems are all likely to be decent investments.
---
Still and again, all of this is pure guesswork and could be totally and utterly wrong. As with all speculation on future CCP expansions, you pays your money and you takes your chances.
---
Thanks Jester! It's really great insight!
---
Complete waste of dev time.
---
Sorry Yodik. Wish it didn't end like this.  
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/75330870/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75330870/)
---
Because you can't train it, if you don't have it injected?
---
I know Eve can be a hard game to understand, but if this concept is beyond you, you may wish to go to hello kitty online.
---
You vastly underestimate the effort required to develop these “anti-bot” features, and vastly overestimate the effort to adapt the bots to deal with them.
---
There are literally no game mechanics that could stop bots for more than a day or two.  Each of these changes take one or more months to develop.   That math means your approach of “just change things anyway” can not work.
---
Again, the only way to combat bots is via their behavior.
---
Rejoice! The EvE of old is back!
---
EVE Monopoly when ??
---
Its been updated
---
Just like they refused to ban the goon suspected for rmt
---
my auth password is an eight, a couple equals signs, and a capital D with some tildes at the end. the more important the access, the more equals signs.
---
Tracking cam wasnt a thing
---
&gt; remove local
---
Laughs in wormholer
---
Seems like a good change, and it will probably not effect skill trading.
---
Skills purchased through the interface will be marked-up, and CCP is reviewing skill pricing, so expect prices to rise (and margin to increase).
---
ill buy that for a dollar 
---
The only skills I don't have are the titan skills, and the unavailable science one.
---
&gt; We're in fucking 2019 FFS, 1080p should be absolute bare minimum
---
Come on now. I agree 800x600 is a low target, but you can't expect everybody to have access to 1080p screens.
---
Having to keep a jumpclone at a school is a PITA.
---
Oh boy the time I spend on PI would shoot up to 1000+ hours so fast
---
Yeah it's a pretty terrible name :| They should have said skill books on demand, skills on demand sounds like they'll just straight up let you purchase skills from the charactersheet for plex :P
---
If I had my druthers:
---
Set everyone (Omega. Alpha gets half) to the same rate of training. (exactly what this is, is up for discussion. Do you go with max, or midway)
---
Remove all the attribute increases from implants. If this means an implant does nothing, remove it. (obviously, with some recompense of some sort. see the next entry)
---
Add time limited training accelerators to the LP store (and as drops to replace any implant drops which were training only) 
---
These accelerators should be the same as the ones used for events, except smaller in magnitude (say, closer to +1 to +5 on every attribute ;) ) Hide all mention of attributes, and just say what bonus you get in SP/hour. These accelerators should last for varying lengths of time, with the longer duration being a little more expensive per hour, than the shorter ones. (This is possibly controversial. But for ease of use, you pay.)
---
So implants become just for making flying ships better. (Slaves are still useful, as who uses them for the training boost?) and you have accelerators for training and no longer as a reason _not_ to PVP, as you can't lose them.
---
What is wrong with the default overview? I asked here https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/av08ns/wanna_help_new_players_fix_the_default_overview/ but got no response...
---
How do you confirm a bot from someone who just *really* likes VNI ratting?
---
Man, this is a really hard one... bait, retard or koolaid?
---
honestly vnis are much better anyways, 50m hull, 15m drone pack and 15m fit, beats the 200m hull of an ishtar and still does 450/490/530/565 dps (Exp/EM/Kin/Term Faction drones, max alpha skills for vni and drones, 4 DDA's)
---
Make it 4 month. 
---
Actually, you'd probably be fine. 
---
Eve implements something known as LOD. Level Of Detail.
---
The further out you are, the less it renders for each ship. Like Guns, for example. They go away pretty quickly. 
---
I'd be surprised if this didn't.
---
The drug use skill come to mind.
---
The loyalty stores used to sell T2 skills.
---
The decryptor skills were exploration items.
---
meh
---
I'd expect skill trading of _cheap_ skills to take a nosedive. Because you won't be able to make a 1000% profit. (Will I fly 5 jumps to save 300,000 isk? nah)
---
Expensive skills, on the other hand, are another matter.
---
Ironic.
---
spoicy mate!
---
You think this is some way for CCP to train people for when they eventually make skills available for $$$ or something? Man, you’re off your rocker lol
---
There’s some very simple anti-bot features, such as the “captcha” idea - even if they are hard to implement, is that not worth it to save the state of the game? 
---
so you witnessed 150 dodge neons come out from the upcoming traffic, crash into the truck and a swarm of police interceptors appearing out of nowhere from all sides of the highway (including above) guns blazing at the neon's? must have been one hell of a show 
---
The only problem is, you're not getting the skillbook. You're getting the skill, directly into your brain. (at level 0) 
---
&gt; Enyobrain.
---
real men fly T1 shitfit atrons 
---
Yes probably with BR it's not the best considering that they neut a lot, but for all the other races is really good. 
---
That's what a skill book does :| It's essentially delivering and injecting the skill book for you. 
---
&gt; \&gt;tab to my 3 killmarked Hel

If you left this out it would appear to be a funny non-salty prose. However, since you mentioned this, it appears you are salty that thousands of goons are accumulating supers and titans faster than killmarks.

---
You can't. Used to use a brawl crusader against ratters. I couldn't mitigate damage from any competent ones even with high grade halos
---
the skin itself looks cool, but im not gonna pay to advertise a band that i dont even listen to
---
oh wow, nice. They finally did it!
---
yyyyeeeeaaaaahhhhhh
---
You want us to bring more, and because we dont bring more because we only have 10 online, you call us cowards.
---
Right, 50vs10 and we are the cowards. 
---
Are you a bot? Surely an Eve player can't be this stupid, how did you manage to launch the game? Did you have to click on all the ads before finding the play button?
---
What's great about eve is that you can make it easy or you can make it hard by which content you decide to utilize. I've been playing since 06 and have seen many changes and core difficuly factors do fluctuate but I dont see anything too drastic...other than the removal of SP loss when you die...that was a bitch.
---
so overpriced injectors at remote hubs sells 100% from ignorance
---
uni skin line makes unfunny.  Needs moar Chinese and Russian.
---
So one of the issues with this is identifying legitimate transfers. Behind every bot wave is a legit player, some of which I'm sure are run by players we all know and love. Unfortunately these players are keen to the current witch hunt so they've smartened up, instead of straight sending 100b isk to your main from your botting alt, you pack an orca with a bunch of expensive shit that you paid for with your botting isk, then you fly your orca through some random wormhole, blow it up yourself and take the loot. 
---
On paper this just looks like some silly orca pilot got ganked with a cargo full of expensive shit, but in reality it's the bots laundering isk in less obvious ways. 
---
So how do you take away all of that laundered isk? How can you differentiate between a legit gank and an rmt scam? In some cases you're pulling isk from a legit botter, and in some cases you're taking the reward away from a diligent ganker.
---
I never buried them, I just hadn't seen you in a long time.
---
Hey buddy! o/
---
Thanks! I didnt know this existed.
---
Oh no he has Air Pods in he can't hear us telling him that Burn Jita is happening oh God oh fuck.
---
I didn't either until I went looking for a fix to Z-S not showing the new jump gates. Been using it ever since.
---
Exactly and they don't have such a huge requirement of SP compared to a super and don't require such a huge isk investment.
---
Imho it's also a lot less stressful and boring than super/carrier ratting. 
---
at the end of the day, there just really arent that many people that actually play eve. it takes time and commitment, which casual gamers know... so anything painted onto the canvass of eve will always be proceeded by its hardcore gamer reputation.   
---
personally I think CCP did a miserable job but they were doomed from the start.  the way games are developed is backwards. 1 person igniting a vision for millions to share? it's a risky investment and borders on a utopian type fantasy that rarely ever pans out.  To me, it's much more sensible for a bunch of communities of gamers to form committees that discuss what kind of games they want, on what engine and who it should appeal to, then to pay someone to make it.  one day, this is the way all the best games will be made. star citizen sort of exemplifies the idea... but services like kickstarter fail to give the people who contribute any real leverage in the development process, which I feel is the essential key element missing in gaming development today
---
https://youtu.be/IDfLETGv28g
---
&gt;  theyre becoming victim to their own years of ineptitude.
---
Another poster on this sub pointed out that for CCP to survive, they have to leave iceland. Their only other choice is to make their team mostly remote-workers if they want to get some really fantastic talent on their team but I've found that CCP is openly hostile against employing people who aren't local to their offices. 
---
I think their developers and engineers and designers are good, but only good, in a sort of B-student type of good. They keep things running well but they don't have a really great handle on how to  polish their work up to deserving of A's. 
---
They need fresh talent on their team yesterday and they've got to setup a new office near some tech center in europe or america or anywhere to get some truly brilliant minds working for them. Their atlanta office was somewhat of a good choice, but even atlanta developers are mostly not the best. 
---
CCP needs to hire several people who are "the best" and they're not going to do that if they keep making them move to fucking iceland.
---
I think they have trained themselves to think along those lines.
---
Because the toon hasnt learned the basics. The idea that it is locked is just laughable.
---
No one likes VNI ratting and if they do they get what's coming to them the psychopaths.
---
nice shit lol.. u got rabbit luck bro 
---
&gt; On paper this just looks like some silly orca pilot got ganked with a cargo full of expensive shit, but in reality it's the bots laundering isk in less obvious ways. 
---
It doesn't though.  You, me, and certainty CCP can tell when this happens over and over again.  And detecting the Bullshit transfers would be 100% easier than detecting bot behavior.   For one thing, the amount of ISK coming off the VNI farms is so so so much more than any normal mechanism.  And the kicker is that you really only need to identify just a few of the participants to figure out the entire structure. 
---
Need to balance all the colors on the new skins.   CCP 2019 balance team.
---
More complaining they will stick the person responsible for the new character sheet and the agnecy on it. Ummm gah.
---
Caps are the most unbalanced right now. They also take the most SP to get into. This is why CCP wont correct the issue...because people would stop spending lots of money to inject into more "end game ships" which is now just titans and supers and Rorquals.
---
Also nobody wastes a month training. They just use their 14 Rorq alts to buy injectors.
---
Since when do we have to read an entire dev blog before we lose our shit?
---
The whatnow?
---
Wow what a low effort shitpost - are you not going to tell us how you sent a cheeky bait fleet around hullpen's staging system to get camped in as a _MASSIVE MISDIRECTION RUSE_ so that you could pull off this daring heist?  
---
Paging some init boi to show these scrub DHSJ kiddos how its done
---
 Who cares about any evidence when suspicions are so strong!!!
---
You know that says vni right? Lol 
---
Turns out there are even more smoothbrains on the official forums than here. Which is incredible. 
---
Looks like shit. Too cluttered to look at. No different tabs. No colour coding or sorting things how you like. No preset tabs to make quick switches depending what you’re looking for. 
---
Please clap, Please clap. Oh god why aren't they clapping.
---
Since you haven’t played in that long CCP will move on ship and it’s contents for free to a system of your choice provided it’s not a ship with a jump drive. 
---
Then the rest you can assert safety to low sec and pay a courier to move it for you, fly it yourself or fire sale it there on contracts. 
---
That's because you're not awoxing
---
-A- is shit, hulkageddon, the madness of montolio, 400million PLEX, armor hacs, drakes and hurricanes. Yes I'd rather have 2012 back now you mention.
---
People don’t really do that for isk anymore. You do it for “free” alt accounts that don’t require constant training. For example if you want a huge industry setup you could make a few accounts of alts with all the industry skills you need in a couple months. Then just extract them after that to pay for the account and now you’ve got a bunch of alts bringing in billions a month and cost you nothing to run the account. 
---
This is the real answer right here.
---
Never not awox.
---
Those are some dank ticks, bro :D

\&gt; Goons "players"

Are we sure there are any left?
---
Alliance of 596 feed fort to 250 people
---
When?
---
I get what you are trying to say, but when was the last time CCP did something with Eve that was 'brave'?
---
All I see is bug fixes and opportunities to introduce more micro transactions
---
no
---
... because nobody else would ever do that, too.
---
I think there are still stockpiles of billions (quantity) Guidance Systems.
---
This is good for the introductory skills. But it shouldn't apply to everything that's seeded - I'm thinking capital skills, but also T2 ship skills and other things like that. The best existing category to use is probably the list of alpha skills.

What is that?

A new C6 type with static LS and Stain connections.
---
I disagree. How many alliances run a fleet of t3c's now ? No one. It got flat out wiped from the game in large fleet fights and that's just the last thing that got canned. This is how it happens every single time we get a big balance patch. Something gets buffed massively and others nerfed massively making the old meta completely unusable in any circumstances because there's now something that is superior in doing everything. That's "wasted" training.  
---
The line of being usable and being absolute garbage is very thin and if you expect to get it right on every ship the first time its 100% going to fail.  
---
Small changes with high frequency are going to make sure more ships are in some way viable and therefore less likely to have people "waste" their SP.
---
That's the point, the dumb ones are repeating the same exact behavior over and over. It's easy to see the obvious ones if you look at contracts. The contracts where you give 45b for a venture and some small ammo are obvious. 
---
Yes if you buy the same items and put them in the same ship and let it get ganked in the same system, there are going to be recognizable patterns. But changing the load out, ship, how it dies, etc. the point is there are a million ways to transfer currency in this game and disguise it as a player mistake or a legit mechanic. Like buying a keepstar and it gets "stolen" by an unrelated alt of mine while I was unanchoring it or something. I mean I'm just coming up with this shit on the spot but there's a hundred ways to make something look natural. If you're CCP you're not just going to start robbing from major corps and alliances on a hunch that these alpha clones getting caught doing dumb things with lots of money in their cargo COULD be running an rmt ring. That's presumptuous and they couldn't possibly risk taking isk from some players that actually earned it. The backlash from the community would be too much. And we aren't talking a couple billion isk. These bot farms are injecting hundreds of billions, if not trillions into the economy. Imagine the Reddit reactions if CCP actually cleaned house of all that dirty isk. Sure most people would probably implicated and know that they were at least dealing with someone that is linked to botting. But then you would also have little Jonny Rocket that bought his first ratting super with moms credit card off a laundering scam and now he's out his ratting super and his money. 
---
You make it sounds extremely easy but it's more ambiguous than that. 
---
Great game btw
---
Disappointed it wasn't a rorq
---
Good point. The money I spend on Eve pales in comparison to what I drop to get yearly season tickets to the theater.
---
Injectors absolutely doesn't balance characters, it exacerbates the problem. They allow (roughly speaking) ISK to be turned into SP. And who has the most ISK? Why, it's the older, richer players!
---
CONDOR COUNTRY 
---
Captchas are a solved problem.  They do not require a human to solve them if you want to keep it solvable by humans.
---
For example, all those lines across the image that mess up "stock" OCR software?  They go to the edge of the image.  The text doesn't.  So, they're easy to programatically remove.
---
Also, you are seriously proposing that players won't mind constantly solving captchas in EVE.  This is utterly insane.
---
If you're attempting to refer to the "green healing laser" above, again the bots read memory.  Even if the bot is implemented by screen capture, they can easily detect a green line going from one ship to another.
---
&gt;even if they are hard to implement, is that not worth it to save the state of the game?
---
There are zero gameplay mechanics that can stop bots.  This is what you need to get through your head.  Zero.  None.  Absolutely none.  There is nothing a bot can not detect that a human can detect.  Every single idea you come up with, even something as insane as "let's add a captcha before firing your guns!!" can be defeated by bots.
---
So let's rephrase your question to be based in reality instead:
---
&gt;even if they are hard to implement, is that not worth it to give bot authors more money as the people running their bots have to buy upgrades?
---
damn niiice lol
---
Ask those ex dopa guys if they need new people 
---
Goons are not allowed to report blue bots per their master.
---
I do Faction Warfare which can be sustained at the smaller end (destroyer down is easy, t1 cruiser/assault frig down is not much more difficult). Doing some of the FW activities earns you LP, comparable in quantity to good level 4 missions or better (without getting into too much details).
---
Specifically plexing can be done in any kind of ships frigate and larger (with size limits for different plexes and need for sufficient DPS for offensive plexing) and is also a decent way to get pvp fight.
---
It's not a way to get rich usually (depends on faction, tiers, and dedication) but it's easy enough to casually make enough ISK to keep in T1 pvp ships mostly. It's possible to also make a lot of money some of the time from FW missions but it's dependent on a lot of factors and especially rewards the dedicated farmer who can switch side to whichever has the best payout option at the moment.
---
I'm in amarr faction warfare at the moment and earn around 300-400m ISKs per week from faction warfare. Nothing to get rich by but I only use the money to get new ships. I also loot about 50-100m ISKs worth per week. I lose around 200m of ships per week generally I think?
---
You must not have been playing before injectors....
---
&gt;Also nobody wastes a month training. They just use their 14 Rorq alts to buy injectors.
---
And they'd be mad about wasting all those injectors too.
---
Every time I try to use drones on my dominix the rats own them after a few seconds. How is drone botting a thing?

LMAO nice job

Wow someone make that guy call the shots. His Eve is a real Eve, with risk commensurate to the rewards of nullsec, and much harder to bot/RMT from alphas.
---
Why won't management listen to him?
---
Want to see a game that is really in maintenance mode. Look at Dark Age of Camelot. It had its last huge update in 2013. Then two patches in both 2014 and 2015 that tweaked bits of the big 2013 patch. 
---
Then nothing afterwards. The game has 10 people who also spend time maintaining it as well as a second game, Ultima Online. 
---
Get out of here with this bullshit.
---
Well, you do you but I'm having fun :)
---
Sarashawa
---
lol @ all the 20,000 isk skins flooding the market
---
who even uses skins/clothes, it's just so flooded
---
Made me laugh. Take an upvote.
---
What's really funny over the last couple of years is how many hyperventilating Goons this guy's brought out of the woodwork every time he scratches his butt. They seem insecure about something.
---
Jeezzz what took them so long?
---
Or just dont release anything, then you are 100% guaranteed to not release any bugs
---
As many mistakes as they made with it, I'm not really inclined to disagree. They at least attempted something different.
---
Well, if you ask most people, the answer will be "lots"  
---
But some MAJOR things (opinion incoming) are as simple as the order of States/Flags, like having criminal/bad sec status/etc be higher than fleet/corp/etc. This leads to a lot of new players calling "reds" that are actually members of their fleet.
---
Also, "lots"

There aren't a million ways to transfer trillions of isk naturally.   And i think you overestimate the length that RMTers will go to make it so.  They aren't spending hours coming up with different new schemes everyday to circumvent CCP.  They use the same method over and over again because it is easy.  Hence why you see all those BS contracts and other crap that is easy to catch (and yet still continues to this day).  
---
And "But then you would also have little Jonny Rocket that bought his first ratting super with moms credit card off a laundering scam and now he's out his ratting super and his money."???????
---
YES of fucking course that shit gets confiscated. 
---
Let it ripen
---
&gt;Small changes with high frequency
---
Small changes are the difference between usable and garbage.  5pg can make a ship great, or render it crap.
---
&gt;going to make sure more ships are in some way viable
---
"Viable" is not enough.  Only "best" is. 
---
There's lots of HACs that are "viable" now.  Everyone flies Munins or Ishtars in fleets despite all the other hulls that are "viable".
---
So when you change "best", you have made everything else crap.  When you change "best" frequently in a game where time=levels, you're going to create a lot of angry players.
---
I always love the Eve music - anyone know the track name?
---
There's room for misunderstanding. People thinking that they are buying the skill book and having it delivered.
---
Only when you stop letting the mittani bang your wife
---
It doesn't work, I've seen some tutorials, and none of them help or suggest anything in a really straightforward non-retarded way, what should I do or read or watch to help me start using Tripwire?
---
But you all were thinking it
---
From what I remember the reason Goons use TACO and not Near2 because Near2 was at the time developed by GoTG guys.  It's legal because it just reads intel chats which require people to report the intel. It doesn't actually scan local and let people know hostiles are there, like I imagine botting programs do. 
---
No. Most of us just realize how incredibly shitty it is to be a goon
---
Literally unplayable
---
You are not wrong, but this is a very typical way of "giving feedback" that is 100% worthless.   
---
"This is crap, fix it." will hardly motivate someone to make it better. And I know, it's not your responsibility ... then why post in the first place? \^\^
---
Hey Brax, how are the DRF renters? It’s been a while since they got stomped and want to check on them
---
I do still log in. I teach new players to become extremely dangerous sharks that are capable of taking on things far larger than themselves, alone if need be. One of my most recent mentees crossed the one trillion isk damage line in his first six months.
---
No, I won't hear you out. Because it's total bullshit. There are new thinks coming out, there are things being announced. Yes, CCP has a communication problem. But that doesn't mean the game is dying.   
---
it's possible to play the game zoomed in, and more fun tbh.
---
ok then. when your opinion becomes one that i give a shit about, i'll let you know :)
---
Exploration, hands down.  It can be sporadic, though. I've spent 4-5 hours zipping through a dozen wormholes only to come out almost empty handed. I've found a single site in null and zipped away with 100 mill in loot.
---
Assuming you're using cheapo t1 frigs, make your fit center around getting your align time down to 2.00 seconds (using Inertial Stabilizers and/or Nanofiber Internal Structure in the low slots) or less (anything less is wasted, so get as close to at or below 2.00 as possible). Going for armor/shield survivability is a waste because if someone is warp scrambling you then you're already dead. You want your goal to be to get away ASAP. And generally, you'll be evading other cloaky ships, and they take a few seconds to be able to target after decloaking, so if you can escape before then, you're good.
---
You can also fit with as many warp core stabilizers as you can fit, but I prefer minimizing align time with inertial stabilizers instead. As long as you have good situational awareness and warp away as soon as a hostile appears on your overview, then you'll get away every time.
---
Sooo good!
---
I'm genuinely glad to be wrong in this case.
---
What about a real-life robot who enjoys rafting in his downtime?  
---
Eve in one image
---
I was playing when learning skills were still a thing. They were stupid as fuck, and some stupid people complained when they got removed too.
---
Attributes are fucking useless. The biggest impact of the remap system is to make training plans a chore for new players. Instead of training a mixture of core skills and ship skills in a way that makes sense with the progression from small ships on to bigger and cooler things, it rewards sticking with frigates for months while you train skills that are really important but unlock nothing "new".
---
A game mechanic where the most optimal way to play is to take a long break from the game while some skills cook is a bad mechanic. EveMon is not Eve.
---
What am i looking at?

---
Then you would even need to play, you could just get a monthly email with your updated balance...
---
All of these are good ideas. I started out mining mining mining. Said fuck it bought 500 plex and gave myself the 1.7ish bil from selling it. Still in super poverty by Eve standards but gets you some starting cash. Used that to fund a bunch of small FW ships, started up PI and used it to buy some BPC’s from contracts. Found a decent spot where mining barges were going for close to 20% over jita price and build a boat load. Also did some exploring and a few combat sites here and there and some abyss sites for something different. DED/abyss sites can give you some decent loot for starting out. Corps can definitely help but do whatever you find is fun!
---
I modify mine from the default Z-S to basically only show enemy ships/fighters on the overview, along with the sun to give me a quick warpout with minimal clutter. The standard overview shows all sorts of structures, stations, gates, that do nothing but get in the way during a fight, and clutter your dscan. It also shows friendly ships on the overview, and if there's a bunch of them nearby you and you're all going for a group of enemies pretty far away, they will be at the very bottom if you sort by distance, and you might even have to scroll to see them.
---
It also correctly tells me if someone is an enemy. If they have good/excellent standing, or are in my corp/alliance, I don't care about their sec status, criminal/suspect status, etc. 
---
I like it
---
Nothing of that changes if attributes are removed. It is a useless hurdle for new players and has no effect for established players. Having to install a program or making a spreadsheet to train your skills optimally is idiotic.
---
The reason mining is safer in null sec is because it's actually relatively dangerous in high sec considering risk vs. reward, as high sec gankers can kill you easily unless you're sitting in an Orca, and even then you either mine slowly in with T2 drones or watch your pricy drones get popped instead of your Hulk/Covetor. It's "safer" because if you're mining in Null Sec you know anybody around you that isn't from your side is there to kill you, so you know to gtfo if you're in something small, or to call in your drones if you're in a Rorqual. As for "no risk" in null sec, I'm convinced people are saying that to watch people lose 5 billion in drones when hostiles show up through a covert cyno to bomb you. 
---
I’ve been playing since 2007, still love the game. Recently left null and am back in HiSec regrouping.
---
I think my next adventure will be WH life.  I spent a short time there a few years back, was most chill, good smaller gang stuff and a lack of drama.  Now I’ve got to start looking for a good small group to join.
---
I guess all of this really means, Eve always seems to have something for you no matter the time &amp; effort you have to play.
---
haha yeah I love idiotic sweeping generalizations about groups comprised of thousands of players
---
By the amount of salt I’m getting it must have had happened more than a few times. Go buy some KY.
---
"Hey this corp is botting, you should boot them from their rental space".
---
Why would I EVER lie about this in public?
---
I am totally against bots. But how they describe it in the video, I would probably quit eve if they monitored all my computer task manager settings.
---
VNIs are very good drone boats
---
Congrats nice job on that
---
Stores is an interesting concept and I do like the idea of having a public and private price for certain goods. Problem is this is only a fraction of business as most alliances have their stores already in their own limited access markets.
---
imagine being this out of touch
---
Nice of you to chime in. Got anything else to tell us?
---
Well I agree with your post for the most part from looking at the 2 "automation consultant" advertisements I have literally been sent to me via in-game mail, which is hard to believe I know it's kind of goofy, are both pixel recognition bots.
---
In another game I play, destiny 2, there was an issue with AHK aim and trigger bots that were using a particular shade of red that only showed up on player health bars, the devs changed this to a transparent texture that shared colors with a great deal of other objects and for a short time you could just watch bots freak out as they spasmed.
---
Now I imagine you could fix this if you were a the programmer behind the software by editing color palettes or texture files in order for your pixelbot to work but then I also could easily imagine the doves doing a parity check on all the texture files randomly and then banning those who had modified extra files.
---
I'm not saying this is a final solution and it definitely only stopped things for a small-time but every little bit helps I guess in the ever-growing war between devs and botters
---
(1) No. Very bad - because whoever has the most market alts autonatically wins the 0.1 ISK war every time in this model. Also holy shit - "oops fucked up my order...gotta fix it, I'll just wait - uhh - *half an hour????*"
---
(2) More taxes and fees? NO. Fucking no. Not at all, ever. 
---
(3) There are already stores, look at Perimeter. There's constant turnover of market structures because everyone is vying for the ridiculous amount kf ISK you make off of that 0.3%.
---
(4) Wtf is "Jita stress?" 
---
fag
---
you can always limit your market to certain parties by docking rights.  Otherwise, in any market, the matching engine will match your buy or sell order with the best available (but won't give you the discount).  If it doesn't match, it gets rested. 
---
I wouldn't worry too much about the .01 iskers out there.  The market does take care of it eventually (or else all the prices would go to 0).  You just have to have patience. If you don't want to be a market maker, then just sell your stuff to the resting buy orders. 
---
imagine being serious about memes
---
there are WAY more botters in Skillu space (not skill u itself) and Frat.
---
try again
---
I think this is probably the right way to go as well what's an interesting thing to consider is that whenever you see someone fall for or you think that someone has fallen for a trade scam sometimes more often than not I think at least that's the way that rmt transfers happen
---
Type face fail.  Also, yeah... lol@me
---
I agree as long as the equivalent ends up being the same as if you are getting maximum sp/hr currently. Being hesitant to train something because it's a low attribute was very frustrating when I was new.
---
I also like the LP for booster because it becomes an isk/lp sink rather than a permanent one time purchase. Assuming the proposed boosters will have an isk cost.
---
I have 5 tabs on my overview.
---
One of them is called "Omni" and shows everything.
---
The other 4 are to my liking.
---
But that omni tab is really important imo, it's important to have a tab where you can see EVERYTHING!
---
I can see why. But I played WoW at the time this took place and the game improved a hundred fold just because there were no bots in the BGs, no bots farming your ore and herbs... You could actually play against players again. It was amazing. If that would be the price to pay to have botless EVE, I don't think I'd have to think twice about it.
---
If it is the same person falling for the scheme day after day you'd probably be interested in how that person came by the billions and billions of isk that he is losing.  And then follow the money out to the bot farms and banhammer. 
---
"I think it deserves an applause" - I still shudder and cringe when I think about eve echoes
---
Guess that depends on your idea of healthy. I enjoy every minute that I spend in it.
---
yeah but no one thinks skill u is invincible so there's no motive to use weird-ass imagined leverage as a desperation weapon
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/av2xqa/ccp_right_now/ yea like reposting it twice
---
Spoken like a true alt in an NPC corp running market bots
---
I agree they have their own markets, but there are a lot more corps in this game than alliances. Jita is still the one place most go for everything... it's time for that to change. 
---
all i see is thin skinned (g)oons posting about being upset 
---
Oh look, its Goons on their way to get their asses handed to them, again. 
---
No.
---
This is great! I’ve been fine tuning my overview for years. I’m going to try some of these tonight! Yes the overview is a serious PITA but I love it’s complexity. Watch a couple of YouTube vids and you’ll get it. I love being able to modify it exactly how I want it. 
---
CCp did an almost direct cut and paste, turning the Winter expansion into the summer expansion.
---
bitch
---
Goons sound fun 
---
At least they shuffled it around.
---
(1) 30 mins too long, 5 mins not enough... 15 then. 
---
(2) Taxes and fees mainly for those hiding in NPC corps... this is a great way to get them out.
---
(3) Keepstars are hardly obtainable to most of Eve. Just like we have big box stores, we also need mom and pop stores.
---
(4) Jita stress... pretty self explanatory. 
---
imagine all the people
---
dont concern yourself with what makes the most isk. instead do whats fun to you and you will learn how to make the isk flow in time. gunning for the one thing that makes the most isk or trying to grind isk to plex your account as a newbro thats the fast track to burnout.
---
And your constructive debate? I'll wait for it...
---
It's the new more streamlined CCP. Rather than release updates, just update the updates page
---
Take your time CCP.
---
It's better to get it out right rather than rushed.
---
When the bot hunter laughs...be concerned...
---
I've been a bittervet for a while now... just haven't bothered making my opinion public until now.
---
Sad but true.   I've let my subs lapse, but I'll always have fond memories of your amazing fleets dropping black hacs or dread bombs on goon carebears. o7
---
&gt; Small changes are the difference between usable and garbage. 5pg can make a ship great, or render it crap. 
---
So your against doing the small change to not make it crap ?
---
There are very few things considered best and an effort should be made to expand the pool of possible ships by slightly fixing them to bring them up to par with the others considered best. I mean how large part is the part of the playerbase that would need to retrain everytime ? That would just be the absolute new comers and i dont think the game should be balanced to that extend around them. I think the majority of long term players would like something else then the 2 ships they fly for the year.
---
did some blops loki stuff not long ago...
---
Just get more friends lol
---
But not like actual friends I mean thousands of faceless mouthbreathers
---
Virtues, max skills, and blinged out Pacifier I could scan 100 sigs in an hour. It's very tedious though. 
---
Don't think Pacifier is the fastest scanner though, Helios and Buzzard better for the extra mid
---
Thered only be 100 of us playing in a wasteland of bots.
---
That's a pretty poor defense to the .01 iskers.  When an item is 5,000,000.99... you pretty much got eternity for the market to "take care of it".  And that still doesn't fix the robo-market. If you're not an active physical person in front of the computer, why should you get to undercut sales? Also, most buy orders are far less than build cost and are quite frankly insulting. Buy orders need love somehow as well. Again, if I knew who was buying... perhaps I'd be more inclined to sell to them? Seems simple enough.
---
&gt;but then I also could easily imagine the doves doing a parity check on all the texture files randomly
---
Nothing says the files shown to this check have to be the same files sent to the GPU.
---
Again, the botter has root access to the machine running the client.  You can not rely on the client to provide any sort of anti-bot security.
---
&gt;but every little bit helps I guess in the ever-growing war between devs and botters
---
Only before the Internet was so widespread.
---
Now, you only need one bot author to figure out a fix for whatever the devs do.  Every change the devs make to break old bots means more money for that bot author as people have to buy an updated version.
---
Any attempt to catch bots has to be server-side, because that's the part the bot author can not control.  Which means you can't do it with game mechanics.  You have to do it via player behavior.
---
No one said that we do.
---
That's why there's iteration. Chop off the broken end, add some to the forgotten end. Rinse and repeat.
---
it's not even a good meme though, dude needs to up his game
---
shit, someone got a couple mining drones bombed.

No it's fine the way it is.
---
So..  you differentiated yourself by knowing the mechanics of bait links? Seems pretty legit pro there.
---
obviously had the intended effect
---
I was in a really small corp in 2014 and I remember one dude that got a titan, between his pilot, good fits, hull itself and everything it cost him around 220 Bil.
---
(1) 5 mins is too long still. 15 is absurd. 
---
(2) This...is not terrible tbh, I'd be OK with taxing NPC corps to get people out into player owned corps. 
---
(3) You can put a market hub in medium sized structures. There are plenty of market Azbels, which are well within reach for mid-sized corps. 
---
(4) If you mean that there are too many people in Jita, a lot of us like this. It's a central place where you can go and see a thousand people active in the game. It's a hub of activity. Without it, the game feels dead. 
---
&gt;So your against doing the small change to not make it crap ?
---
No, I'm saying small changes have enormous results.
---
&gt;There are very few things considered best and an effort should be made to expand the pool of possible ships by slightly fixing them to bring them up to par with the others considered best.
---
This is not possible as long as the differences between ships are more than cosmetic.
---
There will always be something that makes one ship better.  Weapon system, sig radius, fitting room, etc.
---
&gt;I mean how large part is the part of the playerbase that would need to retrain everytime ?
---
TEST has changed primary doctrines about 4-5x this year, IIRC.  And that's in an environment where you think nothing is changing.
---
If you change what's 'best', doctrines will be changed to follow that.  So lots of people will have to retrain.  And then retrain again as FCs figure out what works and what doesn't.  And at that point, your plan is to change everything again.
---
&gt;I think the majority of long term players would like something else then the 2 ships they fly for the year.
---
According to your theory, the slightly worse but still viable ships are just fine.  So go fly those ships instead of the same two.  There's only a handful of truly awful ships.
---
If you kill a bot is it PVP or just player created PVE? 
---
cons: hard to reach the dev, has had stability issues the last few months not related to CCP servers.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Thats as far as i got. At 45s, they say not major imbalances, but subtle ones. Capitals are major imbalance, among many other major imbalances.
---
I fully agree that EVE should not have perfect balance, i'm advocated against that the entire time we've wanted balance changes. There should always be a "strong" or OP ship/ship class. The issue is that there is no evolution or "changing of the guard". We've been in capitals online for 3 years now, its about to make Ishtars online jealous of their insignificant time in comparison, which got iterated on multiple times until balance was found.
---
On top of capital application, we have rorqs (another huge imbalance), citadel mechanics (huge imbalance), pirate/navy battleship cost/usefulness (major imbalance), the isk waterfall that is anom's (huge economy imbalance). Along with several other glaring imbalance issues. None of these are really "subtle" imbalances like they describe in the video that are "good". The retribution was a good example of a "subtle" imbalance until it was beaten down slightly. The orthrus is another good example. Those are strong, but counterable with most long range ships, or proper piloting.
---
No one wants EVE balance to be so perfect to never need future iteration or balancing, but it needs more than 2 (1.5) real balance passes per year to be engaging and evolving.
---
The sad part is, the community has already done the work for them.  They could just copy one of the popular overview packs and its fixed.  The don't even give enough of a shit to do that.  CCP 2019 folks.

Danger game was the most successful board-game in Icelandic history. EvE is currently the most successful sand-box MMO in the space/sci-fi genre. CCP games as a company has produced no less than 2 successful products in their history. 
---
that title almost gave me a fucking heart attack. damn you, /u/ccp_guard /u/ccp_falcon
---
no one wants perfect balance
---
they want some balance
---
So what if it takes a long time?  Nobody is guaranteed a price for their goods.  If someone else can sell it for less then the customer  benefits. 
---
And if you don't like the buy orders, place some of your own and flip the goods.  
---
&gt; "There's plenty of companies out there trying out new shit and reinventing the wheel, blizzard with Hearthstone and Overwatch..." " FF XIV and ESO are crushing it when it comes to MMOs "
---
lol what
---
&gt; The reason mining is safer in null sec is because it's actually  relatively dangerous in high sec considering risk vs. reward, as high  sec gankers can kill you easily unless you're sitting in an Orca, and  even then you either mine slowly  with T2 drones or watch your pricy  drones get popped instead of your Hulk/Covetor. 
---
Highsec mining is nearly 0 risk unless you're lazy or stupid. Just like in nullsec.
---
Also the market always fills the best order, so you never have a choice from whom you buy.  
---
there's no difference between npc corp and player corp with no structure anymore, so... try again

Sounds like he’s more interested in pvp. Signal Cartel / Eve Scout doesn’t control any area of space.

Man, I remember when these guys started making videos, so many people would watch and then claim they were experts at making video games by just parroting the videos and waving them around as gospel and truth.

Ive been gaming for more than 20 years, sometime over 40hrs a week and never even had close to have carpal tunnel syndrome. If you have an ergonomic gaming spot and do something else than playing computer, you should do fine.  
---
\-Lift driver/order picker irl BTW
---
Thing is, its a combination of both. For example I hate mining and I find explo and indy boring to tears and only do them once in a great while, so I'm mainly a combat pilot. In order for the game to remain entertaining, somewhat fun, thus worth paying for, I need it to provide me with enough ISK or whatever else, to PvP at a level that I want to PvP at, and I don't mean caps eitehr as I find operating and flying them utterly boring in comparison to sub caps.
---
So the only way for me to do this is via a mix of PvE and PvP. If the PvE part gets too stale or bad for me, I end up taking a break, it needs to be interesting enough to be entertaining at least on some levels as well, not just the PvP.
---
So horrible PvE is just as good of a reason to stop paying as PvP issues, such as for example cap vs sub-cap imbalance.
---
Sure, I've done the underdog thing, take one out here and there, blah blah blah, but on average and in longterm its the game as a whole that needs to be better, not just a single aspect of it in order for me to start paying again.
---
Things such as Rorq mining, VNI ratting, the last Guardian Gala event, are just as much nails in the coffin as PvP stuff.
---
Good argument have a nice day.
---
what
---
You are saying things that are demonstrably untrue and I can't tell if you are trolling or not. 
---
I'm a mechanical engineer with almost 40 years of experience and I have plenty of cash. Its not an issue of money, its an issue of CCP deserving to be paid on principle.
---
AG
---
These are very good suggestions, definitely a way to spice up market pvp!
---
Not sure I agree really. We like to pretend Eve is speshul but really the vast majority of the population has always been the bored and tired grinding PVE, popping rocks and waiting for someone to hold their hand and take them F1ing. Now Eve may be objectively bad for those playstyles but it always has been, those people have always been here and probably still will be the ones propping up the game ten years down the line.
---
Unfortunately the losses that hurt the most are the people that gave the game it's soul, be they pew pew video creators who can't find fights, FCs who burnt out grinding sov, community service providers that closed as numbers dropped or terrible podcasters noticing nobody was listening anymore. Far too often the reason has been bad development decisions pushing people away from their niches. Jspace is a desert, lowsec has never been so devoid of content and nullsec is so badly broken nobody even bothers fighting anymore. Everyone is so impossibly rich from all the isk dumped into the game mass capital losses barely inspire a shrug. All these things can be traced back to design decisions - structures just thrown out into FW/jspace without a care, PVE mechanics that shit isk, sov that encourages unstoppable juggernauts, SP injectors giving everyone cap alts, etc, etc. The list is not only distressingly long but filled with so many game-breaking, immediately obvious problems it's hard to believe they were okayed by functioning adults.
---
Not that we can blame them really, like you say it's a niche that's hard to make a profit in and they gave it a go with the people they could get. It ended in the tragedy of mass layoffs and since then they've decided to play it safe. But given that maybe it's on us to stop pretending too. CCP aren't the special, unique developer we want them be, rather a corporation that had a good idea once and after a fair run done fucked it up royally. So it goes.
---
Well that was a stupidly long post, sorry.

The only 2 uses of 800x600 are CRTs and multiple clients per machine, with or without running them in a VM.

&gt;You are saying things that are demonstrably untrue and I can't tell if you are trolling or not.
---
Its a cosmetic item. You dont have to buy it.
---
Why are they so reluctant?  Old code that no one wants to touch?
---
It's less of a misunderstanding then buying skills directly for plex which is what it really sounds like. This is the same thing except they don't have to press inject.
---
There haven't been any market updates in like 10 years. CCP can barely get the more important changes in place.
---
Was customer service not trained to V ? How dare!
---
how do you get fleeced when they're literally seeded there
---
oh, it's because the default market sort is retarded. thanks ccp

The amount of salt because some guy is able to multitask, while another tries hard to (even with input broadcasting) but doesn't succeed is too damn high
---
I went into t1 Caldari  and gallente cruisers, for ratting and caracal/Osprey fleets. Then I got a bunch of t2 frigates and t3ds, for everything from logi to tackle to roaming to bombing to ewar. 
---
Now I’ve just trained a scimitar, and am going for a stratios, then a Loki, and after that a guardian. 
---
I think that is a fairly typical progression, maybe change the races of ships up based on the doctrines your alliance flies, though 
---
Do you remember that time when CCP released a new chat system? Oh brother... this subreddit during that, pure ~~gold~~ shit.
---
It's not goons that are doing anything wrong. We're doing what gives us an advantage which isn't even unusual for people for playing video games. This system we have where the biggest profits have the lowest risk but also require skill injection to quickly acquire is by design.
---
So tell me again why people should stop spending money on the game so things can be cheaper for you!? 
---
Merry Xmas for the next fifty years
---
Would be funny if they let people buy this and then just automatically ban them after buying it.
---
How is this game for you as a new player? I’ve been dying to play this but I’m always a bit reluctant when everything I read makes it seem like, given so many have been playing for so long, it’s near impossible for new players to get rolling. Is there any truth to that?
---
I think it was the right thing, just came at the wrong time. Looking at what the next generation of space games is doing, EVE had started that in 2013 and then removed it last year because it was too much of a burden to keep updated.
---
\+ there was them splitting the Plex into 500 individual plexs and increasing the plex price \~30%. 
---
And as mentioned decline of players willing to dish out 3 Starbucks worth of coffee.  + skill farms
---
I think we are lucky it is not even higher
---
Dud you clearly dont know what the fuck your talking about, iv moved billions of m3 via jfs and went 4 gates through highsec to jita on every single run with no problems. There is no reason to take a jf to anywhere else but jita, regardless where you live in nullsec or low. The same cyno you use on urnlast jump to ur highsec border system is your exit cyno, use one toon to scout and just gate.
---
When I was on the CSM I pushed for the default overview to be altered and tailored to better fit the average player and new player. I think the default overview should be replaced with one of the existing packs or a hybrid of a few of them. 
---
shh.. adults r talking. 
---
well they did update the roadmap lol
---
pointing and laughing at idiots doing stupid things is very much part of the whole goon thing. it's fun.
---
the weird thing is, this looks more like a drooler caught by a log off trap than a bot
---
wow yeah, how could I forget about the board game they released in 1998.  I must have been distracted by the DOA console FPS, the VR exclusive Gunjack and it's successor (am I the only one who didn't even know there was a Gunjack2?) and the upcoming VR handball game.
---
I'm sure Valkyrie was really good for the 16 people that played it though.
---
eve Valk was the most successful title on the platform. So I guess you are right that is 3 successful products. 
---
RIGHT!? 2 years ago I bought 3 of the 500 plex packs (excluding the 200s etc etc) just off amazon. But the game seems to much in maintenance mode to justify that kind of of spending. ... Then the Plex changes ...
---
just remove jfing at this point, just make universal deliveries take time and isk
---
Mind sharing this fit?
---
Yes.
---
if that final part is true I think one of CCP's issues is that with EvE they fail to consider how EVERYTHING interacts. I mean how often do some huge corp/alliance figure out how to 'break' a new mechanic? For iteration to be useful they need to know how to shift things in a way thats minor and not major otherwise your being haphazard.

Is this sarcasm because there are no Thera groups?

True, but because most of the above mentioned things seem interesting I guess it was more of "Whats the most bang for your buck" to at least start with. 
---
Ill take any tips you have! Fittings/ships/skills. I'm caldari and near Jita if that matters.

Permaband are one of the reasons I play this game.  [Come Fly With Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXKVnXFQuUA) and [Wrecking Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V117Ycxb6a0) always make me smile.
---
I **guarantee** the functionality exists on launch to swap ISK out  PLEX or an arbitrary currency of CCP's choosing when ~~PA~~ they decide to go for P2W.

Want to inject that skill remotely? Easy. Just pay 1500 PLEX and it'll pop into your noggin at 5th level.

I supplement with mining, primarily so I can use industry to make what I need.
---
I have some combat skills, and recently started running abyss sites in a VNI (only done T1 so far). Once I get some more skills trained up, I'd like to take on more content; pvp, combat sites, etc.
---
Working towards an Endurance right now for some low sec ice. ;)
---
Also stockpiling gas for eventual T3 production.
---
For the record, while I may be in a minority, hold out for the right corp. Dont just join randoms.
---
I've been flying with a small group for a few months, and recently some started thinking I was a spy for a low sec corp because they keep getting suicide ganked at their moon belt.
---
But they havent taken my advice to change up the time on their belt spawn... ridiculously predictable... so I'm kinda back at it alone, seeding systems across empire space incase I need to GTFO for awhile. Exploration absolutely gives you that mobility because the ships and mods dont take up a lot of room.
---
I may be heavily biased though. :/
---
If i were to estimate i'd say hubris is in the way at the moment. I'd guess they're working on a big reveal once they build confidence in the stability (client update, quality of life, server shift+lift etc)..they'll then formally announce a hero feature or two and think "we nailed it" ...but by the then the appetite for courtesy from the gamers will be at an all time low.. so that means something typically we'd likely reward with cheers/happiness will at most land in a neutral tone (will be some minor sugar rush highs from ppl who just react and don't think when CCP speak but thats a vocal minority).
---
Think of us right as a credit score, every day they pull crap that keeps angling towards "we don't have a plan" a point is deducted... so over time it gets lower and lower so when they do decide to dump and praise..the score is so low, it doesn't have maximum effect as it should or could.  
---
Imho, they should be right now re-tasking their messaging / framework and look at this from a new strategic direction  - formulate a plan leading up to whatever the big reveal is that stimulates positivity not remind us of how broken the ecosystem is at the moment.
---
* Skins - Stay away from them for awhile, it just reminds that the easy route is the lazy route "here, give me more money pls"
---
* Security - build more content in the ecosystem, reassure the masses that its not 2x dudes in iceland and 2x dudes in US running the security show manually ...develop more trust content to reinforce the message that the days of botting / multiplexing etc are over and its a top priority.
---
* Mid-Late gamer mechanics. Abys was great for early - to - mid, but let's face it, it was just a content refresh... you take the same mechanics as wormholes, anoms and mix in a lot of new killer art...thats an expansion pack sure..but it wasn't a mechanic change. Rinse/Repeat for early to mid gamers, but anyone who owns a capital or above...probably the least impressed as a majority.  Focus on retaining the end-game mechanics to a new evolution, one that entices older adoptee's to either come back or persist.
---
* Skill Injectors. Start devaluing them with a shadow currency, one that has to be earned. You want players to slow burn to success not rush, the reason being is once they max out their "purpose" for playing the carrot/stick mechanics create a decay rate on adoption of the game "well i guess now i have my super/titan or whatever..im now kinda bored...as what do now?"
---
* Sov / War Mechanics. Hande full of dudes in eve are running the show, war barons worked in the past but now its getting tiresome...what's the incentive to win a fight other than a zkillboard battlereport or some dude line members barely know is now "richer" in turns of sov/assets etc?  Give people a more structured common enemy to then build high performance teams around.
---
* Modify Killmails. Instead of showing what was dropped/not-dropped in a killmail only display what was "dropped". As this will enable EFT geeks to potentially obfuscate their fit strategies from everyone knowing at the first sign of a kill but also change the narrative in battle reports into speculation based less "lol we killed 1 bn...i win" .... as in the end nobody really keeps a mental tally of the total isk they've killed over x time....but it leaves you wondering "wonder what he / she was really carrying..."
---
* Cloaky Camping. Having clients AFK in a system may act as a "har har, made you dock" behaviour... however it has a negative effect on the game, meaning some players will throw in the towel and not log in or take risks. Ok, cool, for those who want to watch the eve world burn, op success...however, growth / logins per hour... its time to adjust this behaviour.

[Dreddit](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/corps:dreddit:joining) is definately a newbie friendly and established corp that you should consider. It's the main corp for Test Alliance which is one of the more powerful nullsec alliances in the game, so feeling trapped/camped shouldn't be an issue for you. We also have plenty of space if you need to PVE and make some cash.
---
We have plenty of PVP fleets 24/7 in both our corp and alliance, and joining them is pretty straightforward. We also have a mentors program if you still need to get into the hang of things. I'm not sure about Horde, but Test and Dreddit offers SRP for our doctrines. (SRP is when you die and we reimburse part of the cost)
---
Hope to see you in-game, o7
---
keeping in mind that the point of unbalance, means you have to revamp the balance time to time to avoid stagnation. as they say.
---
which is a problem as we haven't had a serious balance pass outside of interceptors  since the carrier/fax divide.
---
Just that possibly the markup won't be what it'd usually be in player to player trades in remote regions, unless it's like 2000%
---
Stores is a great idea! THIS!
---
u consider CFC fleets to be pvp? Interesting theory.
---
Yes I agree, I just wanted to point out that having 1920x1080 as a minimum resolution would exclude many people from the game (myself included, I currently play on 1280x720).
---
1024x768 would probably be fine as a minimum, even if still very low compared to must current resolutions. I wonder if CCP provides stats on this subject.
---
I want this:
---
Everytime you engage someone else aggressively you get a popup "You're about interact with another player aggressively. Are you sure you don't want to play nice?" if you hit okay, the other player gets a message "player xy is a meanie and not your friend. Allow him to interact with you aggressively?"
---
If the target chooses no, the offending player is not allowed to do PvP with his target, his ship will be locked down in place for the next 24 hours and then Concord comes and grounds the offender for his outrageously despicable behavior.
---
I think this thread title should just read "fix the UI". I remember being so confused when I first started and everything was hurried in layer after layer or drop down menus.

But, if we do that, some of us might even have to login!  Or even (shudder) *undock*.  And if we did that, and actually tried to do something, it could fail miserably!  We can't have that, can we?  What's next, suggestions that people unhappy with the present arrangement of Null Sec power blocks start putting their support behind groups they *do* like?  Madness!
---
(I hope everyone can see the sarcasm in this post, but I realize that the internet is a sad place, so I will point it out.)
---
you can, just use the contract system. 
---
Even knowing what I'm doing, when I was rolling new machariel smartbombing alts, the first hour was spent  traveling to hits, buying and injecting skillbooks, and setting up a skill queue. It's cancer. 
---
No idea - Jin pointed out below there's apparently a scaling issue with smaller monitors, but I feel like just preload Z-S for everybody and be done with it. 
---
How sure are you of this statement ?
---
K
---
Put an alt with some SP in Pandemic Horde. Seriously, do not commit your main, keep it in HS for now in NPC corp or your own corp, just don't built any structures if you do your own corp so you don't get wardecced.
---
PH does not lack action, it would be good if you put your 2nd highest SP character in it. You can find fleet of all sizes and solo action going on quite a lot. And you don't even have to deal with bullshit checks when joining. Just hop in and have at it. Later on, you can have your main either join as well or go elsewhere if PH turns out to be not to your liking. Also, most alliances won't hold it against you if you were a past PH member cause a ton of them themselves have PH alts, so its not just joining PH that is easier but also switching if that's what you feel is best for you.
---
BTW. I am not a PH member, though have been for a bit in the past on one of my alts. It is a fun place to be.
---
3 rorquals 
---
Why in God's name would you mine in lowsec?
---
&gt; No, I'm saying small changes have enormous results.
---
This is no reason to not make changes. You know what also has enourmous results ? Big changes. Except sometimes we get stuck with something completely overpowered compared to everything else for months when a few tweaks here and there could have instead made those months more enjoyable.  
---
&gt; There will always be something that makes one ship better. Weapon system, sig radius, fitting room, etc. 
---
 If you compare two ships of the same class to decide a doctrine you might pick either one based on how your going to use them. Does not mean that one is strictly better then the other but the problem lies when one or more of ships in the same class are complete garbage and of no use in any situation, that is what people complain about.
---
&gt;TEST has changed primary doctrines about 4-5x this year, IIRC. And that's in an environment where you think nothing is changing.
---
4-5 times in the past year i take it. So in an entire year you only flew 4-5 ships. You can easily train 4-5 subcaps to decent skills in 12 months without even having to use injectors. This skillpoint argument is nonsense and has nothing to do with how ships are balanced. Even so you can just buy injectors so there's no excuse to not be able to fly a single ship in a doctrine unless you started playing like a week before joining fleet.  
---
&gt; According to your theory, the slightly worse but still viable ships are just fine. So go fly those ships instead of the same two. There's only a handful of truly awful ships. 
---
This is the exact opposite of what i'm saying. There are only two groups of ships. Those viable for fleet use in a situation and those that are not. The former group is too small.
---
&gt; We expect a robust and disproportionate response to attempt to crush our spirit. Be patient and recall our times in the hinterlands of Syndicate, running rings around the Casino whores.
---
Yeah. Cause when you tackle a Retardperium krab, you don't get an over retarded response such as Titans and Supers. It always gets me when an "alliance" bitches about being hit by the exact same shit they are doing.
---
I'm surprised ccp hasn't fired the balance team, hired a dog to distract people in the office instead of work, and delete damage control mods and minions and called it a balance update.
---
Edit:spelling
---
lol, yeah that's certainly better ISK wise.. just want to do something different and not so mainstream-ish.
---
Exploration outside of hisec also puts you in dangerous places, which is *good*. You'll lose ships (don't get upset - learn), but you'll make isk, you will learn to fly safe (make bookmarks, use d-scan, etc.), and you'll be better off when you decide to start hunting and fighting others. Nothing you do in hisec or even in deep, safer null will help open up all the fun sides of Eve as quickly.
---
Game is bugged, it clearly dropped half a ship.
---
So everyone is saying the big 3. 
---
but let me reach out an suggest a lesser one.
---
https://wormholes.new-eden.io/#
---
''even if you corp turns out to be shit i will stay just because your mapper is so amazing''
---
''i have tried all the mappers, this one is the best''
---
the thrill of bring my orca through lowsec might be entertaining I guess....just want to try something different :P
---
or...it is a definite possibility...they are taking a step back with the new investment, and are planning re architecture , and re factoring of the whole monolith into a modern microservice architecture.
---
Just mine in Black Rise. No small gangs go there anymore, since its dead. Something killed it.
---
If you remove attributes might as well go one step further. Have skill point accrue over time into unspent skill points. Then inject the points like you would do now. So you can pre-train for the next doctrine. Or for the new player, check out an aspect of the game for 2 weeks to see if you like it, then effectively back train those skill points.
---
TL:DR CCP's latest sign to the community that they have no more fucks to give and are phone it all in from home while playing other games on consoles.
---
This is is a meme right?
---
Hear hear!  The old gray mare ain't what she used to be.  
---
But this is the daily Eve Is Dead thread!  It's obligatory!   If we don't post them, Reddit will shut down our subreddit per our secret contract with the site management!
---
a bunch of people like helping new players so it can actually be pretty good for new players. Most of the big null groups have new player training corps and they sound like a pretty good deal for new players.  That said a smaller corp might be more personal and help you learn better but can also be more of a crap shoot as to if they know what they are doing and can be effective teachers. 
---
Also there's a bunch of player turn over,  when I started there were people years ahead of me, but many of them quit and new players joined over time so I'm way ahead of most people. And if a new player is dedicated they can probably pass me pretty quickly. 
---
I'm sure they have the data, however, all that data is skewed exactly and precisely by bots and an overbearing amount of multi clients running on same machines.
---
This is yet another way that the rest of us get fucked in by those.
---
I'm shocked but it seems like they actually thought an idea all the way out this time before designing and announcing its future release.
---
You fantasy about switching to combat ships won't work the way you think it will, btw.
---
Your Orca fit is shit.
---
Damage Control Unit II
---
Reinforced Bulkheads
---
in your low slots, with Transverse Bulkhead rigs.
---
That's a nice strawman you are making. No one is bitching here.
---
or getting fleeced when they move to null by importers overcharging.
---
Run.
---
Did someone say awox?!?!?!
---
To try to be somewhat fair, if I had a major development delay like this, and released the Guardian Gala event in the state that it was and that release is still very fresh in peoples minds, I'd keep quiet about any delays too.
---
I'm also going to speculate, and say that its the 64 bit client that is holding everything else up, and given the quality ( /s) of their recent releases, they must have realized that they better polish the fuck out of it and work out everything before they let it go live unless they wanna lose more subs and have even more people switch from omega to alpha.
---
It's usually better to read the post first, and comments after, genius. 
---
Why will switching to combat ships not work? Worked fine when I did it yesterday...
---
Siggy was nice but no dev support 
---
Pathfinder is eye candy but turns out to be very slow af even in a private server
---
Tripwire, past the weird looking chains, is actually really nice, I’d recommend that one (+regular dev updates)
---
hmm? Why not? I can't switch ship while locked or what?  just curious.
---
edit: btw, I thought about using Bulkhead but doesn't the Inertia stablizer work better with MWD+Cloak? I assumed, if I got scrambled and can't warp out, it doesn't matter anymore how much health I have, right? 
---
Believe in AWWNB
---
A World With No Blues. 
---
&lt;&lt;This twisted game needs to be reset.&gt;&gt;
---
sadly...no...
---
tbh I'll be more surprised if the 64 bits client actually gets released at a given moment. 
---
Given the blizzard mention I think they were referring to the roaring dumpster fire that is fallout 76 and not Oblivion.
---
Yeah, try reading it. If it is too difficult, I'll hop on comms and read it to you.
---
EDIT: I am sorry to make promise like that and not keep it, but I dont have time right now to explain what so many words mean. 
---
Its actually sad for me to read this stuff here in /r/Eve and there are a lot of similar posts. :/
---
I am very new to Eve. I play for half a year now and I feel the game gets more and more interesting as I learn more skills.
---
Because of these posts I tend to not read that much here because idk, it kinda "dampens" my  fun I still have with this game and hopefully have for a lot longer.
---
&gt; See r/greentext
---
what about actually going to a board instead of going to a reddit proxy of it?

Tell that to all the new bros raging in the forums about high sec gankers like CODE. It is INSANELY easy to kill retrievers and convertors with 5-6 mil gank fit destroyers and only requires a few extra ships for mackinaws and hulks, which limits your options to super tanked procurers or orcas. I've always found it comical that a bunch of goons who can't tackle or follow primaries make their space safer than the AI control regions guarded by invincible NPC ships with super weapons.
---
That’s like less than 1%
---
That statement was like a 2/10. Your shit posting is easily a - 7/10. That takes skill
---
INIT talking about "disproportionate response" when all they know is throwing Titans or Supers at bombers is clearly bitching. Even worse when 2 days before Bliss pinged that fun time is over for the krabs that stayed home and died to us.
---
It may not have even been the wrong time, there were just so many missteps around it--incomplete features with unimpressive gameplay (no real gameplay at all, in fact), crazy prices, disdain for the customer, and more.
---
If Incarna had launched with even minimal real gameplay, like the ability to interact with other players (corp lounge, anyone?) and managed to insult players less, it might have taken off.
---
yes and no 
---
You still can buy SPs from injectors but someone still has to extract SP to make them. Alot of people when reading it at first thought you could just buy the skill from CCP by just creating SP out of nowhere.
---
How is "btw expect the same kind of response that we use" bitching?
---
Everyone knows that disproportionate responses are the best way to protect the farms and fields at home. There's nothing bitchy about pointing out that the enemy is going to do the same thing.
---
That depends upon your definition of "Get Rolling."  If you mean, can a new player futz about and have a good time?  Sure, even without a subscription, you can have a blast.  (A subscription will give you more options for having a blast, but is not strictly necessary.)  If you mean, can a new player personally have a dramatic effect on the political/social/economic state of affairs in New Eden?  Not without truly herculean effort.
---
What you see here in this subreddit is the daily "Eve is Dead" thread.  People have been whining about how the developers at CCP have abandoned EVE and left the playerbase to rot since the game was first released, and possibly before.
---
We have dismissed these claims.
---
or maybe they just remember being a gullible new bro and imagined how disappointing it would be to buy into this used car salesman pitch about building the first palatine keep only to find out later he was just bullshitting and was going to moonwalk with everyone's stuff at the end.
---
literally unable to upvote your post, wtf. yeah had some strange things happening as well. Ship not being maneuverable for about 10 seconds etc.
---
Yeah, it's not bitchy at all to ping, call some nerds a fat pigs that do nothing more than krabbing while your own coalition is full of botters and input broadcasters that can do nothing else than mining, then tell that they are going to send a disproportionate response to wreck your sorry ass, you're right pal. 
---
That only works if the legal entity you're fighting is in a place you can actually fight. Good luck trying that in ruslandia or china.
---
Glad we're in agreement!

\*Just deleted it and remade the post to fix the title.\*
---
Eve Onion told me that goons is all just Mittani's bot alts.
---
Anyone saying otherwise is fake news!
---
Its a copy paste of the same content that was already announced for winter, now being re-announced as spring-summer content. They even shuffled the photos around so it didn't look identical, so they knew it was going to be an issue and did the most pathetic thing they could think of in a vain hope that the playerbase would somehow not notice...
---
If you really want to orca mine in low sec... do Higgs Rigged orca + procurers with 2 webs on them.
---
Keep the orca aligned while mining and warp out of anything lands on grid. Also put your 4th account into a miasmos to run ore. 
---
Okay but there needs to be an in game lore reason why this works in wormholes.
---
In K-space (especially high-sec) you can make an argument that your neural network or whatever is connected to the markets and thus able to remotely pay isk for skills...
---
But from a lore perspective, I don't see how this makes sense for j-space.
---
TLDR: No Skills on Demand in wormholes.
---
&gt;At some point CCP has to realize they hit the jackpot with creating eve and that it was a ones in a lifetime something.
---
I think you are giving hilmar and his buddy buddy club WAY to much credit. I mean these are the same people after all who designed, released and then dumpstered a console shooter only to try, and succeed at repeating their failure 6 years later...
---
"Players" ftfy 
---
Given the way they have been going with changes this past year I'd actually be willing to believe that.
---
what´s commical about it? n+1 is king. the only reason eve didn´t die years ago is that the average eve player had some self inflicted self respect left to at least somewhat clinch to the *forge your own path to greatness* moto. years of recruiting new guys into the gon/ph blob themeparks as well as CCP fuckups have done their part to erode that incentive. i couldnt care less to play eve in tyool 2019. the actual game might be in a better/less buggy/QoL improved state. but fuck the playerbase. it´s beyond gone. 12 year olds on minecraft pvp servers have more spine and fun/hr. 
---
We're due for another upward trend.
---
patiently waiting for EDM to go out of style
---
Joining a big NS corps will just make eve a work, but not a fun game.
---
Go in LS, undock shitty pvp frigs, get killed, undock another one, repeat, make friends, get invited on discord, join fleet, get killmarks, have fun.
---
Repeat for one month.
---
Roam LS alone, make friends
---
Roam NS alone, make friends
---
Roam wspace alone, make spooky friends
---
Ok, you are now ready to enjoy eve, do whatever you want.
---
This is good for EVECoin, just buy at the dip.
---
flair checks out. sad thing there are no PvE only servers in eve amirite?
---
I dont recall bitching in that post. I must have missed that paragraph.
---
inseminated by greed...my new tattoo will say this
---
was that his PI farmhole? idgi
---
Ah! That's a good idea,totally forgot about such thing exists.
---
even the toasters are 64-bit at this point. I just replaced my 9 year old PC that could still play eve and even it was a 64-bit system
---
I am hesitant about the prospect of changing the market system. 
---
Changing anything in software can have unexpected consequences that no one can foresee. The more interconnected a component is in a system the higher the risk of changing it.
---
I can't think of anything in this game that is more interconnected than the markets.  It affects all game activity from pve to pvp. That's not something that would be wise to monkey around with. 
---
From the lack of updates to the market it seems that CCP feels the same way.
---
1) vOv, seems like a QoL change for the botters not the people
---
2/3/4) ummm, they already have this via structures. Literally a thing already haha
---
As for “jita stress” nah, I like having a central, neutral, market. And I’m sure everyone else does too. 
---
inb4 delayed to late 2020
---
Yes it was
---
They should fix the broken things like Ghost Training before changing things like this... 
---
The game feels like what most other games do right before the Developers launch a brand new title and IP. 
---
My bad, I forgot only the northwest is populated and rest of null is empty. 
---
CEASE AND DESIST

Its almost like they realized they can't go 6 months without announcing something but didn't actually have anything ready, so they picked something that wasn't ready and then just keep delaying it until it is finished. Personally I can't decide which would be worse, just admitting you have nothing major coming down the pipe for a whole year or pretending you do and gradually letting the playerbase down over time.
---
New bros dying a few jumps from jita while belt mining with covetors and watching Netflix? What part of that isn't "lazy or stupid" like I was talking about? Lol.
---
I mined in highsec for quite a while and never lost a ship.  I simply got a bit off the beaten path, set known gankers to -10 standing, and didn't go AFK for 20 minutes at a time while my untanked retriever/mackinaw was filling up. It's not rocket science.
---
I've also mined in null (in renter space, small alliance space, and large bloc space), multiboxed to suicide gank miners in high, hunted miners in null, and everything inbetween. I stand by my claim that highsec mining and nullsec mining are both "nearly 0 risk unless you're lazy or stupid."
---
holy shit what a nauseatingly written post lmao
---
Imagine unironically writing morale dribble like this
---
Link?
---
To be honest, the only thing that would surprise me is the 64 bits clients actually being released one day. 
---
I always ended my route at jita regardless where i lived. Delve, paragon soul, Feyth, Tenerifis. SO please keep talking out of your ass. You clearly are either a novice jf pilot or just dont have a fucking clue how serious hauling is handled.
---
at 2006 levels damn
---
If you know how to do that much you would know how to do that in null sec where the ore is more valuable. Miners would never leave high sec if the profit you can get from null sec was the same or lower to the point that the risk to mine there was not worth it.
---
TFW you agree with Xenuria
---
That sounds like a pretty baller idea. 
---
Good. I hope it does. The less PLEX that hits market in this game the better tbh.
---
About time eh!
---
Please leak some goonfleetdotcom tips and tricks, so we can all learn to not die.
---
Go to Jita
---
&gt; If you know how to do that much you would know how to do that in null sec where the ore is more valuable.
---
That's narrow-minded. There are reasons to be in high-sec other than "but muh isk/hr!!!!" For example: you can be totally safe in highsec while playing solo, while you'd need to go to considerable, extra lengths to be that safe flying totally solo in nullsec; convenience of highsec compared to most/all of null; ambience of highsec; presence of people you'd like to play with in highsec; etc.
---
I skin my fleet ships all the time so that I can tell which one in the pile is mine in the event I need to manually pilot my way around something mid-fight.
---
'iv moved billions of m3 via jfs and went 4 gates through highsec to jita'
---
Don't worry, you're elite
---
since it takes years to learn the basics of this game that´s kind of a nobrainer. just sucks for you that unlike us you get nothing to do with that knowledge once you obtained it. better quit while you´re ahead. 
---
What am I looking for? I’ll I get are worm holes and combat sites 
---
I must admit, they made exploration way too easy. I liked creating bookmarks round a system to drop probes. It took effort, planning and skill to get the BM's just perfect.
---
Generally what people will do is make the orders, then send all of their isk to another character. That means even if someone tries to buy a single item (which they most likely bought off the seller at a highly inflated price), even a single unit of an order will fail to go through.  
---
The thing to look out for in these scams is the price history, and a minimum buy order amount.  
---
That's fair. The answer for me. Explo
---
Reminds me of the time a goon FC complained about horde dropping carriers on his roaming fleet... 
---
You know you can already do this right.  
---
All thats left is for them to just take out the middle step (which they should at this point) and take PLEX off the open market.  
---
or i just know what the fuck im talking about and trying to squash retards spreading false information.
---
This was a problem when I quit eve A DECADE AGO. Seriously CCP, wtf?
---
Or how bad
---
+1 for Jita. And then, open up YouTube and search for “Eve Station Trading”. Watch all the videos and apply the techniques they describe. Prepare for one or more people to tell you that you’ll make more isk in less time by ratting in null 
---
&gt;Was just reading EVE skill system changes... great, now make the default overview useful the way it comes is completely broken and confused the absolute crap out of me as a new player.  
---
&gt;Easiest thing to retain more players than anything else. Period. This really should be a no brainer.
---
Yup. Not to mention its also least time / manpower consuming change they could make on top of being incredibly effective.

nice
---
You might consider Brave Newbies - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fprzCHwN6P8
---
It would take a while to find a buyer with such margin.
---
Better try to make many low margin high price orders, stuff like deadspace/faction modules, rigs, popular modules and ships in fw space. 
---
It's much more profitable comparer to trying to outbid a bot in hubs. 
---
Because the promised balance team has not yet been hired.
---
Yeah, knew a guy that had like 25 vni alts and sp farmed them to keep costs low. Also PI is a good passive thing that stacks well with sp farming.
---
What if botting was a skill and allowed you to run up to 6 cruiser sized bots that would run sites once you set them. They would be be easy to find and kill, and would have some kind of npc ai that controlled them. If ccp were able to make that somehow more attractive than actually running a character bot do you think that could have any possible effect on the current botting situation?
---
&gt; We expect a robust and disproportionate response to attempt to crush our spirit. 
---
[https://zkillboard.com/br/107493/](https://zkillboard.com/br/107493/) like that?
---
Gotcha, yeah I've never considered doing it lol, I knew it was too good to be true. Just seems like it could be legit if I had never heard of it being a scam.
---
Tempest 2000 was a successful title on the Atari Jaguar. 
---
Hey it's working great for AT&amp;T's 5G rollout! 
---
To be honest, CCP should just stop allowing PLEX to cover Omega status. They don't serve much purpose anymore in so far as being able to play the game "free" with Alphas..., other than to facilitate bot farms for RMT of course. Bots generate much more ISK than PLEX costs in a month, much much more. You think people who are RMTing don't know this. They make piles of ISK, sub their accounts, sell that ISK out under PLEX to $ Ratio, and keep on going. Its free $. Want to kill bots, kill "Free" Omega's. The option already exists for people to turn cash into ISK. Extractors. Skins.
---
Want to play for Free. Alpha.
---
Want to exchange $ for ISK. Extractors. Skins.
---
Want to be an Omega and make dank ticks. Pay a sub.  
---
Poof bot problem gone, and PLEX problem gone. 
---
&gt; (4) Jita stress... pretty self explanatory. 
---
how is it self-explanatory? even during burn jita the system held up fine.
---
when the market doesn't respond, that's a totally different computer that's overloaded. spreading stuff out doesn't help because markets are regional.
---
Can someone put an Album with all new skins? 
---
Yep.
---
Yeah, that's what I generally meant by wrong time. There were a bunch of more pressing issues at the time that needed fixing and Incarna itself definitely needed more time in the oven. In a way, Crucible was what the game needed but CCP was pushed into delivering it only after the shit went down post Incarna. 
---
&gt;what´s commical about it?
---
You can't kill a concord ship, its capable of instantly spawning and firing on the same tick, it has weapons that far surpass anything you or I can use and thanks to being an NPC it has perfect awareness of what is going on in any given highsec system. Its comical that I a player can do a better job securing space than an invincible NPC with perfect reaction times.
---
cringe
---
Correct - this is a great mapper!
---
_Why_ it is safer wasn't the point of the comment. Fixing it is a long road and, as I said, I don't think we'll be walking down it anytime soon.
---
&gt; "no risk"
---
Please read the words around those words. I wasn't saying there was no risk, I was saying there was no _risk/reward tradeoff_. Obviously there is (technically) non-zero risk, but it is less than highsec despite higher profitability.
---
Yeah dude. I sure would love to be a new player and facetank 10000 different mechanics without any idea what to do. That would make me want to stay.
---
Long ago many of the current mechanics didnt exist yet. You old vets had time to adapt to the mechanics of that time, and whenever new mechanics were released you did not have to learn all other already existing mechanics. This is not true for new players. 
---
As eve gets updated more and more CCP will need ways to help out new players adapt to the ton of existing mechanics. The new skillbook update should really help this.
---
In the end you can make EVE as hard as you want to. So saying EVE is too easy is just a stupid statement in my opinion.
---
sounds like goons have all the action going on these days, is this some kind of reverse anti recruitment recruitment thread?
---
Why would you want to use this? 
---
No idea if real or troll, but ... Dude a ton of us is letting our subs lapse, many have switched to alpha only and remain as non-paying players while basically living of off hoarded crap, myself included. 
---
I would wait. See what, if, anything happens and in which directions.
---
I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how markets work
