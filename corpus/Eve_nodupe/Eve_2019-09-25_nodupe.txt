This is a great proyect, hope you guys have fun doing it and lots of people join your fleets!

There isn't one as far as anyone knows... there are a shit lots of things that need to be reworked, others fixed, others made from scratch and lots of balancing and tiericide desperately needed; but all those things that would actually inject new life into the game seem far to boring to do or something, because CCP refuses to do so.
---
So life as usual?
---
Delve or bust!
---
Good point.
---
My main have one of the mobiles at 0, i put in the queue to 5.
---
Yes to all, if you focus on making isk and become a risk averse krab is not that hard.
---
i resolve selling characters and purchasing one with more skill points. Less spend, one inventory, but always need tweak a bit.
---
Ok. This is starting to make more sense to me now. Unfortunately, I've never heard of a corporation having the particular Recruiter role you describe. I can kind of see how it might work, but I don't know any corps that have tried it.
---
Is 0,0,0 top left, or bottom left? That's what makes the difference :)

Generating images, its top left. Graphs, its bottom left.

Buy it. Fit it as best you can. Buy a second and fit it as best you can. Go fly the first and get it blown up. Fly the second and maybe kill something before getting your nice nestor blown up.

You're more like a space rapist. Forcing PvP upon people who don't want it but too much of a wuss to do any real PvP where the other party shoots back.

---
That's been my experience, but I think the exact form depends heavily on the structure of the alliance. 
---
For example, old Pandemic Horde was similar a monarchy with a royal court, but I'd guess that had a lot to do with being structured (at the time) around one massive corporation and a few tiny ones. TEST is more like a Roman republic led by two "consuls", a head diplo and the alliance executor, who are advised by the CEOs of the member corps. That's probably because it has more medium sized corporations orbiting around one bigger anchor corp.
---
Not trying to get into politicized "TEST good guys, Horde bad guys" stuff, neither of those alliances allow for much (or any) decision making from the line members. I'm just saying that, in my limited experience, the number and relative sizes of the member corps seems to play a role in how the alliance is structured and power is shared. And to build on the point made by another commenter, if a line member doesn't like the decisions of one corp or alliance leader they vote by leaving to join or start a new one. It's a "love it or leave it" model.
---
&gt; They have some pretty strict rules that they enforce in order to maintain their neutrality and is a reason I never joined them.
---
What's particularly strict besides the rule against shooting structures without director authorizing it? I know that years ago, the rules were a lot more strict (in the distant, dark past, not even being allowed to go into NPC Null, which was a bad rule), but right now, the rules are fairly lenient. And does anyone actually enjoy bashing structures?

Mobile Factory Operation and Mobile Refinery Operation are not market items, nor can you sell or search for them them in public contracts.  The only way to sell one is via trade window or private contract.
---
Astronautic Engineering is a market item and there are several for sale in Jita right now.
---
Black Market Trading was a character creation skillbook only for builds of EVE prior to the Revelations patch in 2006, which revamped the character creation process and added additional bloodlines.  The book was never available for sale in-game, unlike the above three books.
---
You're. Line members are not exempt. They are literally the enemy and hurting them is a great way to lower morale.
---
It is not isk neutral. Most of ore goes into ships. Ships give insurance when destroyed.
---
This looks interesting but costs money and is actually quite pricey. I'll save it just in case I ever want to use it. Not a necessity for me as I do have some access to a Windows gaming PC (my husband's), but only one, so we play together in real-time with his PC and my Mac.

It's honestly still playable in 32-bit, just not as good.

---
NPE and live meets, meanwhile the existing players are getting more and more fed up with stagnant mechanics that sap the fun from the game.
---
Eve is a business simulator. Sure, you can grind the isk on drops and bounties; sure you can get officer mods and sell them; sure you can mine all the time, do PI, industry, ect...
---
But the real way to make isk is to do everything and not miss a beat. Get firesales when you can turn a profit, standard buy low sell high. Make your own market. Fill a void that exists. 
---
Eve online is literally market opportunities in space, with a dash of shooting people.
---
If the game is so shit then just quit playing. Easy fix.
---
Npcs are the real endgame lads, never forgot. You think your hot at pvp in eve? Diamond rats would like to have a word with you.
---
I can't speak for the others, but personnally I craft items that I sell at jita.
---
last 30 days I only sold for 140B, usually it's around 6B per day. at minimum 25% margin, it's something like 1b5 net gain per day.
---
It takes me only to buy the stuff at jita, move it to a production center, bring back theproducts to jita, sell them, update my offers, then start the jobs on my other alts. Less than an hour per day. Sometimes 30minutes is enough. Sometimes 20 is enough (I update my orders when the freighter/DST is warping). Sometimes I use more, eg when I log in on the morning
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The thing is to be very precise on the cost of what to do. You need to know exactly what you buy, the price, the cost index of the system, etc. If it's made by your computer it avoid the biases. If you can try to compute the benefit of reprocessing compressed ore (including volumic cost). I have one alt with a reprocessing implant instead of manufacturing. A lot of people ignore the volumic cost, the time cost, the bpo cost (I do for this last one), the invested money cost (if you make 1B but need to invest 50B in material, it's worse than if you make 1B but need to invest 10B only).
---
The hardest part is to have all the bpos. Since I make so much money, I can afford to buy new bpos on contract very often. Also you need a lot of SP, because all your alts are gonna work on the prod ;also having several alts with freighters allows you to split the materials.
---
its a horde leadership laffo copypasta lol everyone taking it seriously.... F

I am a PvPer, who earns my own ISK and buy my own ships and supplies. I engage in piracy when I wish to, in which case any ransoms I demand, or ransom offers I accept (clearly communicating the terms), I will honour.

I am a lifelong learner. I seek the respect of other pilots through mastery of the PvP skills, honouring any 1v1s or duels I agree to.
---
I appreciate the opportunity of flying with my fellow Tuskers. Tuskers learn from one another and Tuskers learn by doing. However, I do not need a gang to practice myskills, and can hunt solo with ease.

I don't smack talk - I respect all my opponents, win or lose, volunteering a "gf." I am free with my praise and advice with foes. I invite those with promise to consider becoming a Tusker.

If I invite someone into my fleet, or if I accept someone's request to join my fleet, they are safe in fleet with me. I keep my word.

There are folks with large stockpiles of PLEX, but overall, supply has also diminished. This is evident in the latest PLEX sales. By "supply" I am not referring to what is currently on the market, but how much they are selling on the website.

---
I would like to derail this shitshow and ask how come CCP hasn't done the more sensible thing by adding a fatigue to skill injection. Like a once a day type of thing? I fall into the "What new players use it for is to bump their training ahead a few weeks quickly." technically on my alts. But I only have the money to inject once a week or two assuming to drop isk on an injector at all. I can't see how adding a fatigue mechanic would harm that at all. Perhaps, if you would so kind, as to enlighten me?

This is an awesome idea, would really love to hear from ya'll on what I can add to my EWAR class for people wanting to join nano-gangs in said ships (frig or cruiser) for my EWAR 102 class i'm working on , feel free to reach out (name is same in game just with a space between thelzar and calzahar

distrobots making 5m/hr is better than vni bots making 9x more
---
This. It of course depends on your corp/alliance/donut's rules, so I'd check with them first if it's ok, but generally, I'd say that as long as you don't shoot your friends and just stay out of the fight against your friends, you should be ok.
---
And the sky is blue. What's your point? Of course you can make money mining. The point is it doesn't add isk to the game.
---
You know what man... Thanks a ton for making me look stupid.... People like you is why Trump won!
---
In all seriousness I kinda assumed bots needed supervision. Like there is no way one guy can play 10 carriers at the same time without a bit running I just though a person would be there watching intell and making sure bots aren't snagged on something

At least in that case *something* is happening. More and more as I get into the depths of the "eve endgame" Im realizing that 90% of the game is sitting in a station because either your fc or theirs chooses not to fight because they dont have overwhelming odds/numbers... At least whelping a fleet means you get to see *something* blow up...

meh u bot ur carriers back ezpz.
---
plus you can do myrms and make back the cost of the myrm in less than an hr per myrm lost.
---
napkin math: 20 myrms botting (50m ticks lowball) =  1b tick or 3b/hr, 8hrs a day = 24b a day or 720b a month. Who cares if you lose a few myrms now and then and you can build them locally and have a hangar full of them so if your bot dies, he can wait a cooldown (or till local and intel is clear again), reship, and go back out there (yes, the "smart" bots can and already do this).

I went to Vegas in 2016 and Fanfest in 2018. I had a fantastic time at both, even though I wasn't in any large group during either one of those times. 
---
At Vegas, I got drunk with Dunk Dinkle and his suitcase of friendship, got to play some cards with Grath Telkin (and a drunk Grath is a very fun Grath), shoot the shit with Mittens, and yell TEST ALLIANCE BEST ALLIANCE to some random TEST guys that promptly got me a drink for doing so.
---
At Fanfest, I got the chance to visit Iceland which isnt something I would normally do even though it's a short flight away, got to talking about CCP MasterPlan about his days in Veto and then he asked me what I thought about local in null, and the limitations of the code/exploits that he found, hung out with CCP Mannbjorn and Orca on a farm drinking some icelanding booze (overpriced as it was but whatever), and played a shit ton of board games with wormholer dudes (Fucking /u/pinkylein is really good at Secret Hitler).
---
So I guess to sum it up, it's just the people part of it. Yeah, the panels and information is neat, finding out about Abyssal deadspace was neat, but ultimately it was meeting people that had a similar interest in internet spaceships with me and just hanging out.
---
Means that they can make a fake one look real.
---
Pure connection here, but could you make the argument that in a very convoluted and round about way mining adds isk to the game via insurance?
---
Awesome to see a new player having fun!
---
I always assumed that bots of that quality were rather rare. I mean I have no reason to assume this just felt that way. I was accused of being a bitter because a guy would come through the system and I would dock up till he moved on. We played the game where he tried to trick my vni into being out of position so he could get to me before I warped. Like it was fun and games then I got mail telling he reported me for bitting. Plus I know plenty of people who straight up enjoy carrier ratting like that's the part of the game they like. They run one account with the carrier and just hang out and make isk and it is enjoyable and fun for them... Do they look like a bit from the outside? 
---
The while botting situation is so memmed now I'm not even sure if it's a real issue or not. 
---
I know there are bots for sure. But I have no idea how common.

bots are more common that you think. EVE is a huge RMT cashcow for whales, just like any MMO out there. and where there's a market for something (bots), there's always going to be bot creators.

Do you have the brain of a fucking insect? I'm not saying that anyone is blameless here, I'm saying that the **NARRATIVE**^TM advanced by Legacy that Frat is dirty botters is lobbing stones from glass houses considering their past relationships with groups they allowed to rent under them for 2+ years, and then their relationship with AOM who (surprise) are doing the same thing they accuse their enemies of doing.
---
Well I am talking about the game’s economy, so isk neutral
---
My mother is dead. Thanks for reminding me.
---
That is the system of insurance that adds isk into the game, not the system of mining. There are so many steps between the two that you cannot connect them like that.
---
As I said to the other person who commented this, it is the system of insurance that adds isk to the game then,  not the system of mining.

Sometimes you just have to be around for the right opportunities. There were two big ones during my time:
---
(1) Right after skill injectors were introduced, it was highly profitable to train a character and then extract its skills every month. I bought a dozen + characters just to farm SP and made billions. 
---
(2) Initially after re-balance rorquals were even more ridiculous than the current version. Reinvesting skill farming profits + characters into a few rorqual pilots yielded more billions.
---
Both those opportunities also coincided with me having a lot of time to play, and me already having a few billion isk to get started.
---
Mine ore &gt; Build T1 ships  &gt; SD  
---
EZ isk
---
Zkill. See what others have died in so you can die with similar fits
---
&gt; I'm fairly sure the poo has been flying in both directions.
---
this is what you originally responded to and went "NO ACKSHUALLY" too.
---
Somebody once told me ~~the world was gonna~~ that CCP stopped giving out road maps because they were afraid of being held to the expectations those gave the players, since they so consistently failed to meet those expectations.
---
and who are you to dictate who can play or not a game the way they want?
---
do they not take a cut?
---
It was a lot of fun. The Kikimoro pilots were shooting steadily.

There is no best place in the literal meaning of this. Best place is the place you make yourself that consists from small parts of:  
---
1) ***zKillboard*** *to take examples from.* (where drake was born)  
---
2) ***Youtube*** *videos*  where  you can find few fights and general concept of ship fitting... and no... armor tanked drake isn\`t a good idea.
---
3) [https://www.reddit.com/r/fittings/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fittings/)   search this thread and MAYBE this question was answered before (4 stasis webifiers on drake isn\`t the good idea either).  
---
4) [https://fits.federatis.fr/](https://fits.federatis.fr/) \- looks like half-assed version of old osmium (speaking of which, there is a file that you can find on the .net that has every single osmium fit and 85% of those are VALID fits... in .txt format that can be imported to PYFA).  4 nanofiber internal structure IIs on drake is a bad idea.  
---
5) ***PYFA.***  Last  bastion of insanity, a realm of polarized rocket launcher wielding armor drakes, shield buffer hyperions and place where tanking 9000 hp/s on battleship is totally possible (as long as it is in PYFA, because in game you\`ll probably get dread/carrier/20 men on top of your head with big ECM stick).  
---
However some common sense:  
---
1) ***Do not ignore your ship\`s bonuses.*** Does it say +7,5% to medium projectile turret damage? Right, medium autocannons will be the best weapon for this ship! Don\`t you dare mount blasters unless you know what you do.
---
2) ***Even out the resists***, ideally 72-75% resists will do but that is theoretical and not easily aligns with goal you have in mind, but evening them out without any holes like 18/70/70/70 is a must.  
---
3)  **Use ONE type of tanking**. Ship\`s bonuses and slot layout is a key. For example: +7,5% to shield boost amount and/or lots of mid slots - active shield tanked, lots of lows - armor tanked.  
---
Others points you\`ll learn from going out there and PvPing instead of sitting on reddit (that adds 0 dps to your current fit).
---
This has been asked for repeatedly and the answer is always you're not getting one. At Eve Sydney Hilmar said this is because historically the company has a very poor record of executing on roadmaps. There may be an internal roadmap but this has not been confirmed I believe. If you want an example of this; we're still waiting on Shield slave implants.
---
Never thought of that, incomplete blueprints
---
And how much is the "well planned 40m SP character"?
---
Ty, sounds good. Can I post fits here for feedback?
---
" We are talking about other systems, which require the player to OPT into entering. "  
---
Yeah, the system the ROOKIES are being SENT TOO..... could someone queue up the slow clap track for kristal plz?
---
You skipped a couple steps there such as refining the ore and obtaining a blueprint through one of several ways, but, that’s irrelevant. The act of mining does not directly add isk into the economy in the same way that ratting does. Therefore, mining itself is an isk neutral activity
---
Remember when Vily said TTT tax would never go above .3%?
---
Same extensions as the desktop version. I'm never going back to Chrome because of this.
---
50m ticks is like krab fit max so carriers. A myrm is more like 10m ticks.
---
If they can't port there extensions like ffs there is a pretty clear winner. Guess I have a browser to download.
---
This is a well kept seacret.. maybe it's cuz I stopped using ff years ago. Chrome runs better on my PC.
---
oh shit ur right, maybe a bit more tho, like ~15m per. so anyways, 15m ticks @ 20 bots = 300M ticks or 900M/hr @  8hrs a day = 7.2b a day, or 216b a month.

&gt;It is not even close to being a tit for tat narrative

Had you even bothered to read my post, you might have seen this line where I pointed out that the overwhelming voice in this narrative has been the Legacy commentariat screaming about how dirty Frat is botting all the time. If you want to see examples of people going "NO ACKSHYUALLY" you can see it on any post where people point out Legacy's longstanding agreements with KWG/Wing's Wanderers and get "ACKSHYUALLY'D" by the same Legacy posters from the first category. In fact, Dran posted some inane bullshit last night how they tried to clamp down on it when in reality **when TEST moved into the south, it was evident that KWG and WINGS were botters**. Everyone knew it. And yet they took their isk anyways.
---
The idea that its been "equal" is falsifiable bullshit, considering that anytime these points are brought up, they are shouted down, buried, and hit with classic whataboutism while the single-sided narrative is advanced.

That's how it should be, but capitals are so horribly balanced so they generally end up as an exception to this rule.

Explosion Velocity and Radius affect how well you damage small and/or fast targets.

They unintuitive key here is that your theoretical damage is waaaay overinflated.

Application modules only make your real damage closer to your theoretical damage.

Look up "Dark Venture Corporation". It's a rookie friendly learning oriented wormhole corp. They live in a Class 2 wormhole with a static class 3 and High sec. This makes logistics very easy.

They might not want it, but they opted into it when they undocked. And you're comparing a space computer game to rape, good job. That got me a miner bingo square, just not the one I needed.

---
My position is a pretty simple one: both of them are bad. And there are no 'shades of grey of bad' botting is bad and test is just as guilty as frat is of it. Just because one side has been louder on this english forum (are you retarded in thinking frat should be as loud here?) does not mean that it was actually worse than the other side.
---
They are both fucking guilty execute them both.
---
This is the moment you realized you wasted so much time training missiles.. you coulda trained guns and been able to use three different weapons systems that apply instantly so long as your turrets can track your target.
---
I did the same thing.. I’m sorry for your loss.

Or you know, maybe OP

PYFA, the only way to understand what makes a ship good is to spend hours concocting ships on this magnificent beast
---
Always loved this logic.
---
I mean realistically, that's what it is out there. Those massive sweeping pictures of nebulae and galaxies were taken from earth, thousands of light years away. 
---
Get up close to one of them, and it's literally just another solar system orbiting one of those dots you saw in the gas cloud. 
---
It's a good Idea, but if you want something like that,  just go to any custom bookmark in the center of a system with little background decor and look around, welcome to 99.999999% of real life outer space.
---
explosion velocity and explosion radius are the equivalent of tracking for turrets. Missiles will always hit a target that they can catch up with. But their damage will be capped by these two numbers. If your targets speed exceeds the explosion velocity or if your targets signature radius is too small then this caps the damage your missiles will do to them.
---
Where as for example of you can reduce your transversal enough you can hit a lucky shot with a turret you won't be able to do that with missiles.
---
Maybe 100-200 km wide, so bright the player cant even see his screen, gravity so strong it rips the ship apart upon coming within an AU of it.
---
I wasn't part of the fight, but let's be real...it's not a GF if you're bringing an Apostle in to fight a standing fleet that's forbidden from dropping caps in that system. That's bullshit maneuvering. If you want to bring a fight bring a fight...but ya, aside from a few dozen good fits they're not going to break the tank with an Apostle repping.
---
did you ever do a video about your terrible mistakes/running alliance ? It sorta hard to imagine all the in game things you have to do/not due and people rarely have a chance to even attempt those things
---
Found a High-Grade Ascendancy Omega bpc in a ghost site, manufactured the implant and sold it.

Its surprising how often people take these sorts of games more seriously than real life. Me? I love the fact that I can play maybe 2 to 3 hours daily and still progress via skills whenever I'm offline.

Aww man let me bring like 3 dps ships after covering logi, damn that should be more fair /s

Rookies aren't SENT to any specific system.

And again, since apparently you'll make jokes about others being slow while deliberately ignoring important aspects of my comments:

Do you feel the systems between the spawn systems and career agents should also be invasion free? What about destination systems for career agent missions?
---
The thing you have to remember about rental alliances is they're not real alliances in the traditional sense.  They change hands all the time when people take over adjacent regions.  New landlord, new rules, but less headache taking over all the existing clients that you want to keep if you keep the names the subrenters know.  Yes we knew there was a lot of botting in both of those alliances; we absolutely still stole the shells of the existing rental alliances because it allowed us to not have to replace an entire region worth of stocked ihubs, pocos, and tcus. stole some of the leadership too.  We just gave them new directives.  Most renters, especially those leading subrental alliances, understand that new landlords mean new rules.  Most of them probably didn't care about botters before we got there but once you make a few examples out of some, most of them learn to stop harboring them or they'll get kicked and locked out of all their stuff.  They understand money, and that following instructions to not harbor botters is in their best interest of continuing to exist and make money.  When we didn't feel that a leader was following that directive, we purged them and found another until we did.  That's why I keep asking CCP for the bot bans of the years we were in charge, and why I don't think they'll ever release it.  It'll start too many witch hunts into all the alliances that turn a blind eye that aren't us.

Ducttape and rust in a box... oh joy!

*I never said they weren't*.

---
**I never said they weren't.**
---
&gt;Just because one side has been louder on this english forum (are you retarded in thinking frat should be as loud here?) does not mean that it was actually worse than the other side.
---
You are beyond brainfucked if you think that WC as a whole is purely Chinese. Loads of English speakers have posted to this forum about this and been shouted down by the legions of TEST posters who swill the narrative koolaid like I've never seen before.

Nah, these things just take actual work.  The only devs left at CCP at the ones too lazy to find another job, and they're allergic to work.

---
&gt;I never said they weren't.
---
&gt;&gt;And there are no 'shades of grey of bad' botting is bad and test is just as guilty as frat is of it.
---
No you just said test was worse because they badpost here about how they aren't botters.
---
&gt;They change hands all the time when people take over adjacent regions.
---
They didn't change hands for 2 years while you let KWG/Wings do their thing in Omist/Feyth unmolested.
---
&gt;Yes we knew there was a lot of botting in both of those alliances; we absolutely still stole the shells of the existing rental alliances because it allowed us to not have to replace an entire region worth of stocked ihubs, pocos, and tcus. stole some of the leadership too. We just gave them new directives.
---
Which apparently didn't include "stop botting."
---
&gt;Most renters, especially those leading subrental alliances, understand that new landlords mean new rules. Most of them probably didn't care about botters before we got there but once you make a few examples out of some, most of them learn to stop harboring them or they'll get kicked and locked out of all their stuff.
---
**BULLSHIT** KWG and Wings were overflowing with bots until you kicked them out of their sov and fed Omist to AOM and Feyth to your own alliance. You manage to speak out of both corners of your mouth at the same time. You knew they were botting, did next to nothing to stop them aside from tokenistic examples which, SURPRISE, *didn't work* and continued to take their cash from them.
---
Why don't you grow a spine and admit you just wanted the rental money?
---
&gt;They understand money, and that following instructions to not harbor botters is in their best interest of continuing to exist and make money. When we didn't feel that a leader was following that directive, we purged them and found another until we did.
---
You mean when you basically dissolved KWG and absorbed almost all of the renters into your own rental groups/alliances, or let them go into AOM? Corporations with longstanding botting history? You didn't find new leadership, you merely shuffled them around.
---
&gt;That's why I keep asking CCP for the bot bans of the years we were in charge, and why I don't think they'll ever release it. It'll start too many witch hunts into all the alliances that turn a blind eye that aren't us.
---
Beyond moronic.
---
So to recap:
---
* You knew that KWG and WSHOT were overflowing with bots for years
---
* You were okay with that because of "ease of transfer" of the renter alliance apparatus
---
* You said that you didn't have the time to handle it (WSHOT rented from you until mid-2018, KWG until 2019)
---
* You claim to have recycled leadership and removed botting corps, when most of them merely ended up back in your allies that you're blue to or in *your own rental groups*
---
* You then go on to say that you pressured CCP to do your work for you that you were *unwilling* to do despite the time that you had control over WSHOT and KWG.
---
JUST ADMIT THAT YOU WANTED THEIR ISK.
---
Join a decent corp and don't be afraid to ask for help. Zkilling the killboards of good pilots works too, but it's a crutch. You'll learn more quickly how to build fits for yourself by leaning on knowledgeable corpmates.
---
Heh, I wouldn't have known from the multiple failed spearfishing attempts. To be fair, we eventually got two ashimmus for the effort.
---
The Nestor is good for wormhole fleet or group use, but it's not so good either on its own or as a straight combat ship.
---
* The Remote Armor Repairer bonus makes it an extremely powerful literally battleship logi platform
---
* The armor resistance bonus makes it very durable, especially when multiple Nestors are flown together and can repair each other
---
* The absurdly low Mass means it doesn't damage wormholes, and it can even fly through C1 Wormholes if it doesn't have Plates online
---
* The Drone Damage bonus and large bay make it a surprisingly powerful DPS platform, while also being a logi-tank
---
* 2.5AU/s Warp speed, meaning it doesn't slow down a fleet as much as a normal battleship
---
* The Nestor has a tiny **Ship Maintenance Bay**. While you can't put anything in it, any allied ships next to a Nestor can use it to rework their fits in space
---
The combination of these factors makes them very capable as either a heavy armor logistics platform supporting Leshak fleets, or when flown in groups of 3, as ships to easymode chew through C5 combat sites for money.
---
However, the Nestor also has a list of issues that make it not really a good ship outside of niche uses
---
* Price point. With the impact on dronelands ratting of the blackout and this year's wars, the Nestor hull has jumped from 350 up to 700mil in the last few months
---
* The Laser and Scanning hull bonuses really aren't useful. There are other much cheaper and more efficient ships for both laser damage and scanning/exploration, in part because...
---
* Speed. While the Nestor has only battlecruiser mass, it is literally the slowest subcapital ship in the entire game
---
* The Remote Armor Repairers it fields still have fairly short range, forcing it to stay close to allies to be effective
---
* Battleship scan rez means it cannot lock target on non-battleships very quickly at all
---
* Capacitor instability forces either cap-chaining (at the cost of high slots, requiring extra Nestors, and ECM vulnerability) or heavy investment into cap stability (and you will look like you've lost your mind)
---
* Even with full Heavy drones, the damage is still a bit underwhelming (especially compared to the also commonly used Rattlesnake)
---
* No CovOps Cloaking device (unlike the other Sisters of EVE ships)
---
If you are thinking of "combat" and "wormholes" (and you don't have a big group you're with), the Nestor's little brother the Stratios makes more sense for both purposes. Good drone firepower, decent armor, works well with a rack of Neutralizers, faster, and can actually cloak which is the really big deal. Also it's a really good looking ship.

That's probably more viable than supers tbh, but still doesn't address the problem of RMTing 0.5% of the eve economy every year without getting caught by CCP.  Unlike botting bans, RMT comes with gm tagged negwallets that alliances can see when accounts don't get banned.  I've kicked dudes that get caught buying 2b isk, how the hell are we going to sell a hundred times that every month without getting caught?

Op's pick:

&gt; My pick: Exodus November 17, 2004. For all the reasons stated above.
---
Unsurprisingly right after Eve Online died it's first and most poetic death.
---
&gt;first mention of ["EVE is dying" was posted by Madox on 30 July 2003](https://eve-search.com/thread/22860-0#8)
---
It was all doomed from that point forward.
---
For my money, Apochrypha was the highest point Eve ever reached for me. It's also the update that drew me in a hooked me. Regrettably, CCP succeeded in killing my love and fascination with this game through years of neglectful development, failed initiatives, broken player trust, and a push to monetize and P2W MTX in a full subscription game.
---
Thanks CCP, thanks for ruining the game.
---
Is that the new scapegoat for dwindling PCU?
---
Reading about fights on Discord means you are not online to participate in them.
---
Which means you are probably doing something in RL, so put your phone away and interact with people next to you.
---
Any process that creates something out of nothing cannot be termed as isk neutral activity. By your flawed logic exploration, salvaging,  abyssal running, wh ratting, etc all can be termed as isk neutral activities.
---
Don’t use a gila. It’s a kitey droneboat, meaning you can’t be near your targets and use it effectively, meaning you can’t loot wrecks until all enemies are dead, meaning ninja-looters will steal all your money. 
---
The gila is good for filaments, not invasion stuff. Can you fly any other faction/t2 cruisers well?
---
Yes, they can be termed as isk neutral because they do not add any new isk to the eve economy (except for wh ratting). I would consider wh ratting an isk faucet because of the blue loot it provides and that NPCs can then buy that blue loot.
---
All those activities (except for wh ratting) introduce materials into the economy that can only be bought by other real players. This means that no new isk is created, therefore, it is isk neutral. 
---
Now, these processes are not material neutral. I do think that the inflation of available minerals by rorqual mining is an issue that needs to be address. However, as I have said, rorqual mining is still an ISK neutral activity because it does not introduce any new isk into the eve economy.
---
Yeah, figured it was ecm wot did it. Thanks for the fight.
---
I think you should find another alliance because DAMN are you retarded.
---
She is relevant because people want her to be, it makes for a good story.
---
Besides that, nothing she says is new, but I hope with all that attention, at least one or two "political points" get spent at things that are good for our planet in the long run.

Tackle is cool logi is good dps can be fun. Find a few cool people to hang with on comms and gatecamp a pipe. Chill pvp can be as good as big fleet stuff especially if you take the time to get know a few people.
---
I joined eve to solo krab and tbh I'm sorry I waited 15 years to jump in. I had no idea pvp would be something worthwhile and avoided it like the plague. I hardly pve at all anymore.
---
Missiles can still be very useful for certain contexts.

PVE being one of those.

Get a Drekavac with a good self-repair setup.
---
*aaaaah ... if only it could levitate*
---
There are a few good options, give Brave or Karmafleets high sec Corp a shot. You'll get to learn stuff and get help without pressure. Eve Uni is another option. I believe r/evejobs may have even more new player friendly corps you can look into.
---
Best suggestion would be to hang out in their public channels and see if how they treat people meshes with where your head is at. Each culture is different, don't rush in find a good fit before you commit.
---
even for us hes retarded.
---
Yeah there is a lot to talk about. There are a lot of people who know a lot more about ewar frigs than me on the discord. Vekuz is a good person to ask, he is a very good ewar pilot, especially with the hyena and keres. On the fleet I will try to go over it briefly.

That's exactly the kind of answer that I was looking for, thank you.

Even my 32GB RAM isn't enough. I noticed a massive improvement when I switched back to Firefox.

In any case, Chrome on mobile specifically doesn't allow extensions. There's nothing about porting, as they have (more or less) the same internal code between desktop and mobile.

Why wouldn't you? I don't try to talk to everyone ever sitting next to me in public transportation, but on longer trips or if you see the same people all the time, speaking to them is an awesome way to pass the time.
---
It's nice to get onboard of a bus or train and see someone who at least is not a complete stranger and I personally think that is more sane than people awkwardly trying to avoid each other.
---
Well, that does not contradict that it's part of WC. Actually, it would support that.

Jokes aside, iron crown is at least not 100% bots (in contrast to others) or very sophisticated bots, as they dropped and killed a TEST hel (if I remember correctly) a few days ago;)

I suppose it's still the ol' way - you have to link EVE to Steam before purchase?
---
Join a decent corp and don't be afraid to ask for help. Zkilling good players works too, but it's a crutch. You'll learn more quickly how to create fits yourself by leaning on competent, helpful corp members.
---
I think this might be a new level of retarded - full plaid retarded.
---
My man, this is literally what purchasing power is. This is inflation/deflation, if you can purchase more or less with the same amount. Because money supply will always go up, but the question is if the prices go up faster or slower. 
---
Our prices have fallen whilst weve had more isk coming in, thats the opposite of "more isk means more inflation". It goes against irl economic theory as well but there are reasons for it. This is in the end a game and one that doesnt fully simulate irl.
---
Now do I agree that things should have remained more rare. For sure. But keeping the rarity was honestly a pipe dream, the game just grew too old.
---
I love it
---
Has your client also been randomly freezing since the last update  leaving you to force quit ?
---
Mission accomplished I would say.
---
So people can not constantly in starter systems ? 24/7 50% is better then every 4h 100% for like 30 min
---
More*
---
I didn't know a model could be out of date and unplayable.
---
Just wait for it. Green man gaming even went down to like 70% or something once.
---
We need the victims:)
---
Welcome man, glad to have you. If you need anything hit me up.
---
Ye age of chaos was the opposite of planning dude. Dont blame the people who saw it for what it was from the start.
---
If you use an injector it adds an amount to your unallocated sp equal to your current tier of return. At 70m using an injector for me adds 300k to my available skill points to use on skills.
---
They are spent 1:1 from that pool, but added to the pool via the diminishing return structure
---
Gmg terms of service only allow for one account per household and limit purchases to 1 per Gmg account which is stupid.
---
Ye like Jintaan said in the other thread, dont expect anything for quite some time. 2/3 of the devs seem to be working on the new NPE so forget about anything real being changed. Feels like age of chaos was only implemented to make us forget that they werent gonna do anything relevant for quite some time.
---
As fking usual.
---
idk the specifics all i know is that its frustrating for me who actually knows what he's doing, i'm sure its like 10x as frustrating for a new player  
---
plus i often see belts further from jita that're full, i dont think botting would be an issue considering that, plus if your bot is in highsec and not null you're probably doing it wrong lmao
---
Unless this is insta respawning anomaly that have enough ore for few people NPE missions.
---
So what? Game should be designed around real players, not bots.
---
CCP gave a load of these away at EVE Vegas a few years back, each person was supposed to get one but they had a load spare so I went back for another. I have the Tempest and Apoc sitting on my shelf, I'll get some pics later. They were too big for my luggage so I had to get them shipped home.
---
There's anoms for exactly that problem. 
---
Not CCPs fault that you didn't notice them when doing the starter scanning missions.
---
Yeah, i wonder how many DEVs they have left who really design game-systems, iterate (lol) and do the actual implementation (programming). 10? Even less? Sure seems to be not many with the extremely slow pace things are developing atm...
---
They have a sell by date on the side of the box but it's normally still good a few days after that.
---
not to mention as a logi you usually tend to use auto-aggro to remove ecm drones off of you in stressful combat situations
---
Where tf were people like this when I was new?
---
You have now instanced PVE that you can do in higsec that will make you more than a supercarrier ratting in nullsec.    
---
This broken PVE can be done in **any system of your choosing** by using special keys.
---
Buying Characters via Reallife Money isn’t allowed .
---
buying isk via CCP will prob. Cost you 800$ to buy a character with 80m SP ..
---
Lowsec is dead , nullsec is a giant blue donut ... 
---
level 5 are lowsec only and level 4 are the same as befor the just added burner missions which are a bit more profitable
---
I mean this is what i get for people ninja-editing their posts to 500$ originally they didn't have $ in it so now I look like a plonker.
---
I bet CCP would do that for half the price if you asked them direct.
---
This is so pathetic. Everyone speaking out against bots is a good thing. Test are the only ones who actually did something about bots in their renter alliances. And you get all in arms about them not doing enough and even worse TALKING ABOUT IT. 
---
You are on the wrong side of history here I'm afraid. You should get mad at people who silently accept bots in their renter alliances.
---
Game is now free to play. Paid accounts are like how they were when you left. Unpaid accounts are much like trial accounts. 
---
This system is called Clone State. 
---
The old plexes were divided into 500 miniplexes. They function the same, but now you get 30 days of subscription time with 500 Plex. 
---
Subscribed accounts are called Omega Clones and unpaid ones are Alpha Clones. There's a bunch of limitations applied to Alphas. You can look into what's relevant for you yourself.
---
No Level 5 missions in highsec.
---
No computer controlled punishment for looting. You are free to shoot _any_ looter you find. They will be free to return fire.
---
Lowsec is pretty dead.

What your missing is that most missile have terrible application.  By far the most used missiles in eve are rapid lights, precisely because they are a cruiser sized module with good application.  If you want the higher on paper dps of heavies, heavy assault, cruise missiles, rapid heavy missiles, or torpedos, or capital sized missiles, you need to be packing modules to improve application.  Even rockets and light missiles start to drop in damage when hitting interceptors and other extremely fast frigates.  Prior to the release of these modules, most missile fits packed a rigor and flare rig for precisely this reason.  Having access to application/range modules in the mid slots greatly increases applied dps of missile ships as it leaves the lows open for ballistic control systems.  Also, keep in mind that many missile ships are operating at extreme ranges are really don't need to dedicate much to their tank. Often an ancillary shield rep or two + a damage control is enough tank, maybe with a rig or two to fill the resist hole.

Maybe CCP decided that because of all the whining that you no longer deserve nice things...
---
Nah, if eve dies in the next decade it might become valuable. Too many hard core eve players will be at an age and have the income to be able to afford memoreblia like this if they didn't own it already.
---
I totally agree with you but it should give players the opportunity to not , because they will do.
---
buzzfeed trash
---
That's not the reality we live in.
---
I tried and failed to find the right element way back. Though I'm not sure if it's because of my lack of experience or Javascript fuckery.
---
Ha! Yes. Precisely
---
I think they should give you a high sec gate to stain instead.  You know, maybe from jita to stain.  Yeah, that's a great idea.
---
&gt;And why all the Rorq and Carrier pilots were crying big fat tears about having their income hampered.
---
Except you can't multibox carriers like you can Rorqs. They require you to be paying attention and clicking like a madman. Carrier ratting is not particularly high isk per hour, and isn't scalable like mining. 
---
Carrier pilots are pissed because people like you keep complaining that they're OP in terms of isk generation, when they're really not. If you were talking about a super you'd have a point (but these can't be multiboxed easily either). 
---
You don't seem to understand that you absolutely can't multibox carriers effectively in PvE. Two is possible, but I wouldn't recommend it. Significantly more than that is basically admitting to botting, as that's not the kind of APM a human puts out, and certainly not for long.
---
For the last time
---
#Carriers don't scale like Rorquals. 
---
You aren't making billions carrier ratting, without putting in the hours required. You also can't AFK carrier rat. Have you ever even owned a carrier?
---
Nobody in his database.
---
Yeah, although that happened under the old 32 bit client usually too. I can't wait to get back to the 64.
---
If you are sitting in station waiting for other people to serve you content on a silver platter, then you are doing it wrong.  
---
Undock, be active and content will find it's way over to you and your buddies.
---
is this made by a young teenager? xD i mean, you may be speaking to each other, but your not 'speaking' to each other. or learning facial expressions as much or as well as you would. your not keeping your chin up, which instinctively makes you happier.
---
That's how kidnappings happen. You start occasionally seeing someone on the train, you let your guard down, they gain your trust and become "not a complete stranger"- BOOM! Next thing you know, you're in a back of a van, being raped.  
---
Just be dicks to each other, its safer that way.
---
pretty sure the average age of eve player is 25-30. we all old bastards
---
Yes please. I love ships with a massive sig radius and low EHP.
---
Well.. if they do try to change the mechanics atall all they get is unsub protests from the null powerblocks..  
---
You wont let them change it (unless ofc it aligns with nullblocks vision for eve) been this way since Incarna maybe even before that.  
---
soo yeah.. What can they do? Not alot really.    
---
Imo its best if CCP just start a new server with CCP's desired changes for those who can embrace change, keep TQ for all the ones who cant deal with change so they can keep "their eve" and let the chips fall where they may..   
---
Maybe not a great buisness model tho.. but maybe it just might work.
---
Toilet
---
Not entirely fair considering that there are balance concerns wrt shield slaves.  
---
And their implementatiion is still moving forward, just at a snails pace (iirc armor slaves got renamed on sisi recently, but i can't check right now)
---
I felt that eve uni gave a really false impression of what eve is/can be.  I was in the uni twice when I started, and quit when I was told not to undock, and that I needed to mission, mine, or trade to make isk for my pvp ships.  On top of that, being told to fly glass cannon tackle was a complete waste, and I didn't learn to actually fit a ship until years later. Returning for the third time, and joining CODE./spectre fleet/redemption road was far more informative.
---
So just don't go.
---
"The people that saw it for what it was". More like the krabs that screeched before the change was even live.
---
You have enough evidence on screen : he got cyno blobbed while ratting and is now warping out with his pod
---
Is the VNI good for Abyssal?
---
I read that as Midweek crises
---
M-O.  Just shout in local that you want a 1v1, and don't warp to the E-O gate before that.
---
At Eve London a couple of years ago, someone had managed to projectile shit all over the inside of a cubicle and also into their underwear, which was left on the floor.  Have fond memories of trying to work out who the unfortunate gentleman was.
---
I still don't get why people are so upset about trig ships. On the one hand you want the game to be developed, it happens, new content is added, and somehow you are still asspained about it. Great.
---
Jintaan, do you plan to do a video on impact of null 80% bluetral donut on the game?
---
u/squizz why don't you use [BAT](https://basicattentiontoken.org/)? I'm sure you'd make better revenue &amp; you won't have to beg people to unblock ads.
---
I dont mind the trig ships, im upset that CCP wont do anything else.
---
Jokes on you I'm too ugly to be raped!
---
&gt; Exactly, I never disable ublock.
---
This and any website that tries to force you to disable it to view the full website can fuck right off too.
---
Good thing zkill still functions without disabling it.
---
&gt; BOOM! Next thing you know, you're in a back of a van, being raped.
---
I read that and was trying to imagine john madden saying it.
---
Sometimes, so do i.
---
Uh, you might want to check this yourself.  Charon's have dropped significantly, but other other t1 freighters haven't moved much.
---
What's really interesting to me is that the number is down, but the value hasn't dropped much.
---
Doesn't the career agents take you to a specialized spot specifically for that career agent to be able to mine from that 1 veldspar deposit (to mine to make like 300 tritanium or something?), outside of normal belts?
---
Trust people? I did not tell you to stop being an EVE player
---
It will be hard with alpha skills, since you can't use the 3 advanced scanning skills, or have the basic ones to max, so scanning will suck.
---
And no cloaking...
---
So, on 36 Toons, that would be 23.4b per month....
---
Do those toons have to be omega to pull this off, because at that moment you'd be looking isk on plex
---
Another version  of the ad:  
---
"Do you have a clear vision? He has..."  
---
;-)
---
My ryzen 3 2200g with vega 8 runs fine on medium!
---
Man, I started in the wrong location!  Glad you're back and loving it! Safe sailing o7
---
Value didn't dropped yet, market need a while to adjust.
---
They ever add any Jove space content?
---
Ingame for PLEX there will be lots of people, as ISK is shitted in multiboxed megatons in current EVE and 10 Bil is a single weekends mining haul for 1 person. So if you usually buy PLEX to get ISK because you do not like PvE it is not a bad deal as that 10 Bil ISK would equal 100€ for PLEX.
---
I am told that you can just create a new email to utilize it again; GMG don't even care if you use the same payment over multiple accounts...
---
Hillmar indicated in his AMA last time (in direct response to my asking him that question) that they would not be doing the same level of sales this year as they did previously. I expect the sales on these DLC packs will be rare, far in between, and this may be the extent of the saving possible on them.
---
Also you should probably factor in that the act of selling all that PLEX and buying all those injectors will influence both the PLEX sale price and Injector Buy price unless you space it out sufficiently.
---
underrated (sadly)
---
One of the big issues with online interaction is that you miss all of the additional social clues and data that your brain usually processes i.e. is this guy potentially mentally insane? That's why people end up in lengthy online arguments with people that would have normally just been ignored.
---
Actually you have roaming drifters that occupy jove space, in the instanced PVE you also meet them there.
---
Everyone waiting for Hilmar abdication. Cost is growing do to bots coming back after Blackout (disabled local in nullsec).
---
2008 baby!!   
---
bring back the good old days!!!!
---
Refresh.
---
Plex got split into smaller pieces, it's 500 plex for 1 month
---
Missions suck, if you're looking to get brain damage you can't go wrong running L5s
---
On the subject of loot CCP needs to implement the runescape looting system. Make a wreck only visible, or lootable (probably more realistic), for 60 seconds by the person who did the **top damage** on the kill
---
Nullsec sucks because there are few people in the game with imagination or initiative. People would rather blue each other and krab, or camp out in one area for 5 years
---
Idc about pve loot.  Best pvp loot I've ever gotten was a 60m sansha module I scooped from a fight the first week I started playing. That really kickstarted my Eve career
---
MLM listings can buy and sell plexus that you hear that may be short. Talk to all the common cancer patients Are these ?? the test to actually try
---
Er; what?
---
The point is you had enough supers to cause small groups migrate to larger groups. While crying about the big groups being too big. That the damage I'm talking about. The Legacy alliances were the quarterly punching bag and fresh talent source up until the point where they accidentally were left alone too long and managed to get strong enough to retain their people. This has never been a sustainable model or good for the game. PL is guilty because they had the people with enough skill and game-sense to see this coming yet chose to accelerate it.
---
Rookie welcome chat be like: YEAH SO IM IN A SHIP IN A BELT WHERE ARE THE ASTROID

Minmatar Offensive Systems 5?
---
be glad, i wish i could just never have experienced the last couple of years
---
Went with "how can I make BNI fly with Moas like a Moa and provide two boosts". Ended up with a decent fit, surprisingly.
---
I can't find bots in D-P or QLPX markets, but I can easily buy battlecruisers. Why should I use a bot when I can rat in a Myrmidon fairly safe?
---
So who was right? The people who screamed bots for 2 months or the ones saying that players were leaving? Dont try to rewrite history dude, just accept the facts.
---
Stabs no longer allowed inside plexes. Is a problem for largest though https://zkillboard.com/kill/79096362/
---
if i dumped 20 grand on eve, it would be because i can buy isk whenever i want. i dont need to farm.  i just dont want limitations in what ships i can fly and what i can do.
---
Lmao knew an insecure faggot like you would be jealous of a fucking kid
---
Hey! I read an another eve post about the pandemic horde being a welcoming corp to join? How can i get invited? Ive always heard of the game and literally today downloaded it, and played 8 hours. Still feeling lost though lol
---
Good question. The age of chaos was perfect for them, basically no dev time to accomplish large changes. I am extremely happy they got the signal that this shit isnt acceptable and that they actually need to do shit for the playerbase to be happy.
---
When you differentiate between isk neutral and material neutral then it kind of makes sense. Ratting is material neutral and mining/explo/abyssals are isk neutral. They are two sides of the same coin.
---
&gt;Rookies aren't SENT to any specific system.
---
There is a beginning mission arc that connects you with the starter mission agents... have you even played EVE?
---
Ignore the spodbrains saying the game is dead.
---
Customize your overview. Go into the game, click the + icon on your chat, and join an overview channel like "SaraShawa Overview". Will make the game a lot better immediately.
---
Join a corporation, important. Skip mining in a venture for some retards and instead "venture" (haha get it) out into low/null/WH space, it's where the majority of the content is.
---
I would also skip joining the mega blobs, ESPECIALLY the ones that are more newbie oriented. You won't be more than just a number, and you will actually have an impact/learn more/experience more/develop into something other than an F1 monkey by joining the smaller boys.
---
Find some way to make money, if you're going to stay in highsec, try incursions, maybe WarpToMe fleets if thats still going on. Use the money to practice PvP with frigates in FW if possible, master the basics, meet people, have fun.
---
I recommend using [PYFA](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/PYFA) for planning fits and learning how to best optimize them with your character.
---
Everything in Jita local is a scam. Don't haul anything in a T1 hauler EVER in high sec, **you aren't safe in high sec** High sec simply means the police will respond to punish the offender, and it is realistic in the way that the offenders aren't always caught.
---
Buy skilling implants, and skill into a jump clone. Every time you leave the station, switch clones so you never lose them.
---
Have fun man, my personal recommendation to you is WH space. I think it's the most enjoyable part of the game right now, especially with the current null politics (half the map being blue), and sov mechanics.
---
&gt; There is a beginning mission arc that connects you with the starter mission agents... have you even played EVE?
---
Less than a month ago I helped my girlfriend through this stuff.
---
You get to the end of the tutorial and it suggests you go to a Career agent and then gives you a bunch of systems that have career agents. Not 1. Many.
---
And....once again...
---
Come talk to us in the in-game channel " Join Horde"
---
Who the fuck gives fleet commands through text on discord?
---
Sorry but you are talking our your ass, mining does not generate new isk into the system, neither does salvaging or exploring. For these activities the isk comes from other players.
---
The only isk abyssal running generates is the red loot which you sell to NPC vendors and the same goes for WH ratting.
---
&gt;On the subject of loot CCP needs to implement the runescape looting system. Make a wreck only visible, or lootable (probably more realistic), for 60 seconds by the person who did the top damage on the kill
---
What a stupid, stupid, stupid idea.  So you hero tackle and die fighting, get top damage, but can't scoop anything in your pod so your fleet of friends can't obtain any value from the wreck.  "Realistic" ... You're serious?  A ship blows up, there's a wreck, anyone can loot and salvage it.
---
you can try to play with what your opponent think about your ship.  
---
my 2 favorite unusual ship fitting are a polarized brutix (because they have so much ehp, no one dare to choise it as primary)  
---
and self rep blaster eagle  
---
both are still alive after few fight  
---
the satisfaction to come back home with an absurd fitting is incredible =P
---
i always thought [duckstroll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOcJR9vFqHw) was the best representation of what wormhole space is like.
---
Same here,
---
the target painter add what? 40% signature bloom? (its not a magic number every ship literally shows you its signature value)
---
if the speed of the target is correct )you can make this happen with missile application/explosion velocity speeds or webs you technicly could make you deal 40% more damage, (if the missile stats allow it) but unfortunatly a missile that would allow it would only be dealing a small applied dps number for the %boosts to be applied.
---
in eve pvp. things are actually closer than people would usually think.
---
say a Drake is shooting a rifter. the drake using heavy missiles without any web/target painter/missile lowslotx2forapplication without any of these things, even at max skills the rifters armour repper is going to tank the APPLIEd damage of the drake, with the web+etcetcetc the amount of applied dps tends to fall into the amount the armour repper cant keep up with, and you kill the rifter super fast between its reps.
---
now do you fit just a web, and be able to kill the rifter, or do you fit, web, painter, and a rig and a couple of lowslots and be able to kill tankier more expensive frigates much better as well?
---
same with guns, do you fit tracking midslots for optimal range etc, or do you fit a web so that you track better close in. its a choice. its not the modules suck
---
Not to mention that the career agent systems are not the starter systems...
---
about 3. and do we really need them?
---
alos, theres the faction missile+drone ones.....
---
and abyssal? what more do you need
---
&gt;Do you feel the systems between the spawn systems and career agents should also be invasion free? What about destination systems for career agent missions?
---
yes... duh. You need to give people  a chance to actually get into the game relentlessly killing them with god like NPC's while they are still learning the game is the fast way to declining numbers of new players.
---
Ye what zeroniss said. Just create new accounts. And there is amazon and humble store as well. But like he also said it seems they wont have a sale for some time.
---
It is all fun and games until you find out that they are in it for the long con and once you class them as friend they have you mining and running missions in their Corp with taxes and ore buy back programs.
---
Gmg definitely cares, their EULA clearly states one account per person per household. If you want to let a friend use your card that's not the same thing as you making multiple accounts with bogus info to game the system. Humble bundle has the same once per account limit and whole I didn't dive into their EULA during the sale of 2018, I can only imagine that restriction is per ccp.
---
Protect yourself and your accounts, as someone that had to have an info exchange with security last year I can't stress enough that it's just not worth it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2p2s7m/player_age_distribution_in_eve_online_oc/
---
Last/easiest age distribution I can find from 2014 puts the average age at 31 or ~32 (depending on what type of average you want to use).
---
Of course people leave the game, but I'd hazard to guess the average age is closer to 35 these days.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/qtMO4U5.png](https://i.imgur.com/qtMO4U5.png)  \- then my math is wrong :(
---
I wrote a small program to work this stuff out a while ago and i get closer to 28k. I might need to check my routines that work out the injectors needed.
---
is that a, POLERISED 0tank entosis typhoon? aye?
---
We are awful too, don't worry.
---
Sitting down for the big presentation about the future of eve and what great new things will be coming in the year.
---
Also being lied to the whole way through the big presentation about the future of eve and what great new things will be coming in the year.
---
NPSI always.
---
Okay, so you realize that would be a SIGNIFICANT portion of highsec right?
---
There are 12 tutorial systems and 12 career agent systems, with even the nearest being 5+ systems from the tutorial system, and the furthest same faction one being 10+ away. Then each system has a rough mission range of 5 jumps.
---
That could be upwards of 500 systems that would be invasion free.
---
&gt; You need to give people a chance to actually get into the game relentlessly killing them
---
Yes, the tutorial systems.
---
&gt; while they are still learning the game
---
At what point is one no longer "still learning the game"?
---
And how is a popup one HAS to interact with not an effective self selection gate?
---
nice catch
---
just like in real world, no worker (aka krab, mission, miner...) can be insanely rich. to aquire hundreds of billions isk (or trilions) you need some alternative way to earn money : scam, trade, heavy industry.  
---
the only exceptions are some very high end Pve/mining combined with a lots of time dedicated to farm as NS super krabing, multiple dreads in High class WH or rorqual multiboxing
---
There are just 400 LSIs in Jita at the market.....

---
my personal step by step when im flying a brawling frigate in lowsec =
---
1. dont go into somone, make them come to you in the site, or catch people landing at 0 on the entrance.
---
2. the moment they are on overview i click approach (and select the ammo type i want to use against them)
---
3. when they almost stop from warp i turn my prop mod on (im usually sitting close to 0 on the entrace beacon)
---
4. left click them once, and spam the lock button on the 'Selected Window' box. spam it until it starts locking
---
5. once you start locking pre heat scram and webs if they are in a kiting frigate just to make sure i catch them
---
6. start firing (unheated) you can let your weapons and module flash to engage immediatly when you lock them.
---
7. turn off heat on midslots as soon as possable (i may need this heat later in the fight)
---
8. once i have them tackled and im comfortable i have speed over them or the fight is at close quarters and they are not trying to run - i will start to heat to pump dps into them as long as:
---
* if i am missile ship i try to kite out around 4-6km
---
* if i am blaster boat i will try to orbit them at 1000m
---
* if i am autocannons i will try to either just approach them(dont do this if they have drones), or orbit at 500m
---
* if i am drone boat, keep at range is good at lowering thier orbit/turn speeds for drones to track
---
9. the moment my shield is gone on my armour frigate, i heat my ancillary, and cycle its reps heated, leave this on unless you notice theyre dps is nothing and you can afford to not rep (this adds input requirement from you, but your winning the fight so, thats fine)
---
   10. changes ranges, ammo, knowing what to do against certain enemies comes with time. once youve tried all the weapon systems, and learnt thier strengths, you can start trying to play into your enemies weakness, and your own strength. (theres no straight up way of explaining this)
---
   11.check heat on guns at this stage, one or both of your tanks are starting to break(some people heat this late in the fight to be able to pressure later, personally i like to burn reps and cause mistakes with heat. some guns overheat faster than others, heating rockets is a art form trust me lol.
---
   12.with both of you about to die, one will try to escape, keep an eye out and do things like, load longer range ammo?maybe, overheat scram when theyre gaining distance,  at this stage having a bit of heat ability left in your prop mod (which is why i stated at the start overheating mids is a timing thing and not to be wasted) your prop mod is what can confirm you kills if your in a tanky slow dps ship, youll be outrun often, so you need this overheat to keep up and grab the kill.
---
   13. lucky number 13th step, i saved this for last because no matter how experienced the people i meet are, this is something frigate pvpers ignore WAY too much, overheating that prop mod, whatever it is, mitigates damage SO much. and often can keep you in control of the fight. usually in a fight, i heat my prop mod once every other cycle. maybe heat it for 2 cycles and keep the rest of heat for the end. youll need to learn about how the modules react heated on your ship, as not only is it chance based, sort of random, but a prop mod if your unlucky at max skills can burn out in 3/4cycles. sometimes you get 5 or 6 cycles, 6-8 cycles if you do one heated one not. you can seriously mitigate damage against ALL opponents using this, ''tank overheated? need a little more, its heat prop mod time''
---
with all this do i finish a fight and the last cycle of my heated prop explodes my mids and my web prop scram burns out, my ancillary repper burns out, my ships glowing with heat, but i got the kill. this is perfect. NEVER heat your guns to death its not worth it, but mids and lowslots? burn them fuckers out (as long as your heating for a reason) as often in frigates there will be alot of times if you dont heat your ship dies anyway, i mean, then who cares. 
---
i love frigate pvp. fast, skilled. mistakes on boths sides always, yes it sucks if you go against a guy with expensive pod, but dog eat dog.
---
GLHF, and pass the knowledge on when your a master :D

Time to uninstall.

Adding [THIS](https://i.imgur.com/iICfIOb.jpg) in case of some devs checking :)

---
The reason heating your repper is important: that ancillary gets a % bonus on AMOUNT each cycle, and it reps a HUGE amount. so the heated bonus is massive, when its out of charges, any frigate in the game can beat the armour rep output, so your time is limited in that ship at this stage. your 'HEALTH' is inside that repper. if you dont offload it, offload it when your full armour, or dont run it heated, your literally just wasting tank, playing with less tank really doesnt improve your chances of survival or victory. you also can heat an ancillary, and it will run out of charges, and continue to rep WAAAY longer than the charges last. so just leave that thing heated until it burns out (AS LONG AS YOUR OVERREP is minimal or nothing)
---
Depends on what you mean by "best"
---
Rattle is heavy, well-tanked with decent damage but it's pretty much a Netflix boat. I doubt there's a more boring boar in existence. If you don't have Netflix or work to do or something, you're gonna have a bad time with it.
---
Yeah i plan to afk rat in it, any builds for it? And where can I go to afk rat at
---
Then clearly you don't have a brain, as it used to be time = sp.
---
Also I feel it's important for some reason to tell you to fuck off.
---
Looks like I don't have to waste my super in a lowsec event. Was gonna do that if AOM turned out to be playing by the rules like they promised. Then again I was sure that wouldn't be the case. Especially now that their leadership bought 2 tril RMT iskies. 
---
As for KWG... still flipping the bird to PIRAT every time I visit Amarr. As for PIRAT leadership was and probably still is tied to their huge super botting ops.
---
Jove content: yes. Is it in Jove space; no.
---
The decendants of two opposing Jove factions have come back and decided to pick up where they left off. Both sides hold somewhat contemptuous opinions about pod pilots and will happily shoot you after they've shot each other.
---
You carried me in that fleet, I was anchored on you
---
As someone who did rattle hunting for a LOOOOONG time
---
Do t2 cruise launchers with precision ammo, a Rigor catalyst, target painter and active tank
---
Far better dps, can still one shot frigates without a web
---
And a clear range advantage
---
Then you're evidently a damaged individual. Smh
---
Why do you keep stating computer game when your sat in a computer game forum talking about a computer game you autistic fucking retard?

---
Every major null sec entity has a bottling backbone, end of discussion.
---
Do not sperg on this comment. If you claim your group of snow flakes don't bot then you are a) not part of a major null entity, b) a liar, c) not a relevant figure in your entity to know any better.
---
lowsec dead eh?  go to asakai,rahadalon,huola...its not dead,only activity is dead.
---
word is there's going to be a open beta/test coming near end of the year
---
Cheat to compete. God dammit I gad to endure that shit on ARK Survival Evolved when my alliance got attacked but cheating Chinese and Russian players. Only way to kill them is using their own methods against them. Devs didn't do shit.
---
Somewhere close to a trade hub. 
---
If you like trading in Dodixie, then Old Man Star is good for ratting. If you're a Jita man, then Tama is your best bet.
---
Trig sites do Thermal and Explosive. The rats that live near to both of those trade hubs do Kinetic Thermal. Skip the EM unless you're in Amarrian space.
---
solid advice right here.
---
I have the Tempest and Apocolypse on top of my 2 miniature cabinets along with the Rifter USB hub that came with the 10th anniversary box.
---
They're lovely kits, just wish I could find a raven and megathron for sale at a price I could afford.
---
When a thief is being bombarded by accusations of thievery from another thief, it doesn't make them all enjoyable. Yeah, one can laugh at the hypocrisy and the bigotry, but also bet rather annoyed after a while.
---
They finally added some Jove content aye.... I always had this crazy idea get in fastest ( forgot the name) interceptor fly for Jove space bookmarking your progress there. Even if it took months to a couple of years. But I don't have the time.
---
Yes it can, just play for a longer time in null/wh, and always make sure you live like a poor college student even tho you are making big isk.
---
I still have to find one... but I don't hang in the proper holes too often.
---
&gt; healthy hobby
---
Suuuurreeeeee
---
Lol. I understand the context
---
Aaarrrggghhh my grammar autism...
---
Nooooooooo
---
I prefer laziness, let the drone do it's thing and just RHML the frigs.
---
Isnt it wondrous what treasures you can find in garage-sales and on flea-markets at times? &lt;3
---
I'll eat my fucking shoe if you can explain to me how and why krabbing is bad without just repeating what you read other dumbasses parrot on Reddit.
---
Yeah, that's what I meant to say. Cheap ships are fun and you can buy more of those than bigger ones. There's just plenty of people who feel required to spend a lot of money on ships, or just don't "want" to use cheap ships for whatever reason.
---
proceeds to feed AT ship lol
---
yep it happens to couple of ours guys with T3
---
Find something you enjoy doing that generates ISK or sellable goods and just play the game and enjoy... Set your main-toon a max ISK-level and send all excess-ISK above that level to a seperate toon as "piggy bank". It just sums up over time.  
---
And dont be me and run around through trade-hubs like a 6yrs old through a candy-store :D
---
Navy Battleship rebalance?
---
The don't discount bulk purchases though, so it is best to wait for the $500 packages to go on sale, then notify your credit card company, then buy however many $500 packs are on sale, then hold it for a couple months while prices recover. That is the most effective way to convert your USD to in game ISK.
---
Except you re a Rorq, then its: 3200s all teh way ;)
---
lol... you guys find everything ;)
---
Right now reread what I said.
---
Still have all four of these on the shelf in my living room - bought them back when the EVE Store was based in the old CCP North America office in Stone Mountain, GA :)
---
Yeah. You wouldn't play EVE and say "shit, someone entered local, let's all dock up immediately" ... right? Oh!
---
You really try hard, but you can't get around the fact that you're basically speaking for losers and hypocrites, who project their failures onto others. Seek the problems in yourself, because that's where it originates from.
---
It's not the other people's fault they're playing the game as intended and when other people deliberately make themselves victims, then that's on them. Only them.
---
No hard feelings.
---
In soviet CCP we like pvp!
---
im inviting you to ratting in vecamia and ane..safest lowsex systems.
---
"free" after paying some free $ yup
---
It is NOT a isk neutral activity
---
The ore has a value that it can be sold for, and by generating it (because it always respawns) you generate value
---
bad bad bad...  a type exposive deflector and therm a type deflector  then shield extenders and shield power relays and core defense field purgers.. you need minimum 2 DDA and not gecko but any other heavy drone,you can still plop some small/medium if you like/need but still heavy drones best.and NO RHML because reload time..  fit HML or  HAML
---
or smartbomb them
---
[Poper Blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pop-up-blocker-for-chrome/bkkbcggnhapdmkeljlodobbkopceiche) You have to train it, but it's good for a lot of anti-adblock overlays
---
can i hav ur stuff pls
---
I think you're confused.
---
I mean the sub is more fed up with faggots like yourself that can't seem to kick their addiction to a game they stopped playing years ago. Maybe consider necking yourself if you are that incapable of kicking your addiction than brigading what a weak retard you are
---
In highsec?
---
Where are you doing this?
---
I definitely won't cloak up next to you and get you concorded
---
&gt; am I missing something? 
---
whatever you´re shooting at.
---
looks like adsense did its job
---
Check out [Rykki's Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml#) for which sites you can do. For alpha, I'd stick to C1\\2. 
---
As for the fits, base it around shield extenders (don't fit more than 2\\3, its not as useful as shield recharger past this point), purger rigs and shield power relays to match the take of the site you need to do (If you want to use Drake). A cheap but better alternative to Rattle might be passive-fit Praxis. Same concept as Drake, just scaled up a bit and uses battleship weapons and drones. \\
---
That said, I'd expect you to die quite quickly if you don't know how to be safe(ish) in WH. Possibly by me and my small crew :D 
---
There is a lot of say about safety and there is a ton more to say about krabbin, but I'd suggest you join a corp and learn by talking and doing.
---
Is that 01:00 or 13:00 EVE? Can I join if I'm afraid of wormholes?
---
Wait till you find out that sansha phantasm are battlecruisers
---
You didn't underline the misspelling of "mainly"
---
People think sitting on trains doing absolutely nothing is somehow "good for you".  It makes no sense.
---
Too fit to play EvE.
---
I've played on emulators for old, niche, dead MMOs that have more development than Eve.
---
consumer logic
---
how in the world exploration and salvaging are NOT isk-neutral?
---
Abyssal running and Ratting (WH or not) are not ISK-neutral since you get isk from NPCs but the others, fuck yeah they are.  Rigs don't create insurance, neither does production. I would argue that salvaging and explo are actually isk-negative since the take the ISK away in form of industry taxes.
---
Yes bots get killed.  Does this mean they’re ok...?
---
Get the fuck over the “feed me pve kills to prove something” entitlement
---
It’ll never work out, and it doesn’t make you or other hunters a victim because people play the game as intended.  aka not feeding you for unwinnable “content”
---
Geeze that’s not even hard to comprehend you know that man.  Come on
---
Send it to me and I’ll double it for you.
---
The invasion, yes. The filaments, no. Same thing as the gila, but reversed, the VNI is only good at very close range
---
ok thanks :)
---
One of the best ones.
---
Apology email??  Dang, I've never seen that but judging by your upvotes I'd say it's a thing.
---
Yep. I think they even start using that weird ore that cant be sold on the market towards the end to prep you for Mining Missions.
---
I think this is a case of not reading the training missions.
---
Sounds like some other games.  
---
"So where's the rest of the features you promised?"  
---
Game company: "Skins"  
---
"Yes but that's not the whole game,is it? there's got to be more"  
---
Game company: "Skkkiiiiiinnnns"
---
If that's a model I'm willing to part with £150 plus postage and packaging UK :) PM me.
---
if you looking for fits for solo pvp search the ship on zkill. go to montly top and find a player with a lot of solo kills and look at his losses.
---
I thought MC had the shirts?
---
I just take my laptop while everyone stares at me
---
7/10 for vision

9.5/10 for not putting *too* much effort into it

Nice.
---
The fact that CCP now has confirmation that it isn´t worth it spending any development efforts on changing the status quo to revitalize the game and its playerbase? 
---
What do you guys expect? That they will suddenly invest huge amounts of resoruces into a game in maintenance mode to try to fix the core issues which might or might not upset larger parts of the remaining playerbase that has proven to lack the flexibility to adapt to changes that impact their playstyle in non insignificant ways? Completely reworking systems they have implemented and developed for years with n-times the resources comitted to the cause? 
---
Testing if it was worth it to invest into the game was a major part of blackout. Turns out it isn´t. There is only one viable route to go from now on.
---
The Eve Discord dude clearly has a bicep.  None of yall nerds have biceps.
---
You misunderstood, the whole concept of FW bots got "killed" (i.e. patched) by 1st disallowing warpcorestabs in FW Plexes, and then after recognizing the fuckup CCP additionaly banned the Venture (a ship with built in warpcore stabs) from FW Plexes. So there are in fact no working FW Bots anymore
---
Toustain
---
I hadn't heard that there was a reason for the delay, I know it was announced ages ago but never materialised.
---
Thanks!
---
Are you.... okay mentally?  I mean that as respectfully as i can ask that. “Bots r ded because eve took away one mechanic” is... it isn’t even logic.  It’s just parroting an agenda without even trying to think... 
---
Because you’re so wrong it isn’t funny and you have such a surity on top of it that it’s staggering.
---
From what I can tell, it's the former addicts relapsing back into the grind. 
---
Of course, I'm only really speaking from experience here. But it's getting more difficult to explain to other people how this is essentially my meth.
---
Yup because we actually work to look for them. It's one of the advantages of a smaller alliance, bots actually stand out rather than fade in to the background.
---
idk if this applies to the galaxy packs, i bought my first from ccp and 3 discounted from gmg in sales, no problems no account juggling
---
shut up little pubbie retard ... XD i got laughing cramps ...
---
Appreciated! Buuuuuut I'm going to see if I can re-form my old Corp from scratch. 
---
I had a pretty neato cloaker scout group that used to hire ourselves out to mining companies for pathfindind/escort duty. 
---
However once I get that set up and you lot feel the need for an extra set of eyes, lemme know!
---
I've been reading up on that. 
---
Is there a concrete way to actually map out this shit yet? Or is it just sort of a "keep an eye on signals and just yolo it"?
---
Well, use it when it's possible. It's not realistic to look up 20 people in local. But if there's only a handful, you can quickly see if any of them have recent kills and what they were, or if they have a history of killing frigates with a loki, or whatever. Along the way, you can see if any are in the same corp, or if they appear on the same KMs a lot, etc.
---
Proxay what have you been looking up m8
---
Your corpse can will be a fine addition to my.. collection!
---
Ccp should start selling those things again a lot of people would like to buy them

Dumbass

Honestly homie, it was a fucking plot twist for me too.

Last time I was doing runs do jita, I was being gifted charges direct to my hull. 
---
Now they're just handing them to me by the stack. I have never squint eyed a thank you harder in my life.
---
Pretty sure it's based on stuff you already look for...
---
Glad to hear you enjoyed it!   
---
I usually as of late always choose the tackle roles, mainly because there´s a lot of entosis going on in my alliance, but also because the role of a fast tackler is super fun. Both the satisfaction of getting that scram onto someone, and I love hunting ships down with my d-scan skills which also is super satisfying when you find out how to use it proper and a way that is comfortable and successful for you!
---
Thank you! Happy travels friend! o7

Woah. I wish I had one

40+ year old dumbass with diploma kiddo

You have adware installed. Recently there's been a rise in Chrome addons that pretend to be adblockers and hijack ads instead. This is the end result.
---
..... i wouldn’t care if you were 100 with 7 phds
---
You’re acting ignorant and i’m calling you out
---
No particular order because it's early and I've already dodged too many hobos on the street before having my coffee...
---
1.  You're never alone.  There are always cloaked ships watching you.  They know whether you're trying to scan down and explore Relic/Data sites, huff gas, map a chain, or play bait.
---
2.  Find friends to fly with and join them if you like them.  All depends on what you like to do.  What ship(s) are you interested in flying, or have/training the skills for?  Regardless, get your Cloaking skill to at least IV.
---
3.  Watch YouTube tutorials about whatever you're interested in doing.  Words here won't always help when you're staring at your interface and don't know what D-Scan even is.
---
4.  Always bookmark/save the location of whatever hole you jump through.  Jump from High Sec into a wormhole, bookmark the location back to High Sec as something that will alphabetize at the top of your saved locations when you right click on space, e.g. *HS or !HS or ..HS
---
And 5.  See #1.  Wormholes can make you rich in isk or salt, because you're never safe and you don't know just how sociopathic people can be.  They will camp every entrance to a wormhole system with multiple friends or toons for hours, never showing they're present, and wait for you and three friends to believe you have eyes and security so you can run combat sites in your Leshaks.  It's not *always* about winning fight after fight for wormholers.  Sometimes it's about the quality of the workmanship and the intel that go into seducing pilots into believing they're safe, so they can be fitfully salty and lube their own looty wrecks with delicious tears.  You are never safe.
---
Maaaate incognito for the yiff shit, ya hear me?
---
Does that still happen? Because local seems to be just a clusterfuck of isk scam.
---
I swear I am one Nigerian Prince away from reaching some sort of breach between eve and reality.
---
Indeed very helpful advice. Might use it myself perhaps
---
I remember seeing a Rifter model at some point. It's my favourite looking ship other than the Corax. Anybody know where it could have been from?
---
Call me out on what? Whith your obvious No-Knowledge about game mechanics and your salty whining about blackout? Yes blackout was half-assed, but just for the tears of hello-kitty-gamers like you it was worth it. I am an actual Bot hunter so just shut the fuck up ... you are a salty kid with no knowledge at al, did you even play before 2016 and konw something else than the FarmVille Clone EVE is since then?
---
Yeah I remember that. The ore was some weird name starting with a B I think?
---
Sorry dude, but that's based on your search history, cookies and such. Nothing wrong with it, but don't blame zkill.
---
&gt; Facebook
---
lol
---
Yeah I have been! 
---
From what I can tell, they look like little solitary buckets you can stash all your shit in. 
---
Which is great until l you realise how many holes are in the bucket, and no amount of sticky tape is going to seal that up. 
---
I mean. It's great for me, I'm constantly looking to steal everyone's pile of sugar so, yeah. I like it :)
---
I shit you not, I just checked my mail before to find the generous souls, and the last one was literally from CCP, welcoming me to the game, gifting me the fruit basket. 
---
You are 100% spot on with that statement 😂.
---
I'm getting them as well on my work PC which has never seen smut. I turned adblock back on.
---
Yeah. We got reset to what we were before the whole thing started. But, for a short while, I was very rich!
---
This is retardation in a post.
---
typhoon fleet to be exact.
---
It's a cesspool of high sec carebears, wormhole care bears and people generally bad at pvp that live vicariously through zkill and high fiving each other on how badass they are and regurgitating EVE memes as quickly as possible.
---
no they don't for the one where you need to build cap booster 25s, you need to mine  Plagioclase or other minerals because veld only has trit. there is no deadspace mining site provided
---
they don't have anoms for all the missions. when was the last time you ran them?
---
technically speaking missiles never miss, despite their name suggesting the opposite, but good meme anyway.
---
\&gt; Asteroid belts in **starter/career agent** systems need to be infinite
---
there's infinite spawning anoms in nullsec, guess thats not a problem though is it?
---
Not the old store, but the old old store. This fucking game
---
Would be a short Vid saying "Sov Nullsec is basically ded in the large scale, except some "tolerated content regions" like Querious or Tribute.
---
#bigname
---
im highsec found quiet system with emergent conduit then i warp at site,mjd away then let them come and then i set off smartbombs,when all rats in range die i turn them off then send drones to kill remaining and when second vawe comes i repeat this and so do in next/last vawe. ofc rattlesnake does it quicker and is risk-free but smartbomb leshak under faction smartbombs is not bad,it brings risk vs reward and adrenaline rush when local spikes!
---
Git fukd
---
Have you run the full tutorial? The anoms are only available for a few.
---
Yep pretty much, but apparently the smart people that see things for what they are don't recognize it, heh.
---
This.
---
Yeah no, I see what you mean but a. I get decidedly non gay stuff right now and b. NSFW ads are not okay
---
There was a guy who played daily and was the #1 highest skill point character (think he started day one).  Nice guy, talked with community, etc..
---
I think he left the day injectors showed up and someone just paid to beat his characters skillpoints.
---
Was a sad day.
---
It's not made anymore. I wrote to the company that made them. IIRC they had one spare for sell
---
The one is my cureent system seems to change location constantly.
---
They've been available on every alt I've ever made since their addition.
---
Yeah, have cleared Chrome data and it's back to selling me plex.  Definitely not the shit I'm into, but must have hooked into Chrome somewhere. Weird as I don't really hit much up.

Damn. I love building models and having a Rifter would have made me so damn happy. Thanks for the reply
---
I mean you can easily break an apostle once you've neuted it out. Considering the numbers Horde can bring this wouldn't be an issue with subs.
---
They're the most OP ship in the game.
---
Endgame eve shouldn't be fought in frigates.
---
Why not?
---
But it has too much salt, that is your problem.
---
Hah, they sure showed those dumb suits their shortcoming with that emotion fueled (and totally not expected) baby rage tho. Now CCP will come and fix the game. They must come.

i could log into mumble but only got every third word.

as FRT showed us at the end of a recent strat op, bombers can bomb just fine

Hmm, work PC and incognito mode, the only service that I have open is reddit.
---
Even if it would get data from my home PC, those ads are certainly not reflecting my browsing behavior.
---
I think the more simple explanation is: Incognito mode without any tracking data or something = porn ads.
---
Because let's be honest, that is what most people use incognito mode for.

Happened lots in test, usually something like.

Log your dreads in take the beacon to xxx and dock in the fort, say nothing on comms

Sadly that's the state of the game. That a keepstar isnt a big deal anymore.. just like titans
---
I had very much drone aggro problem with domi..
---
Tried eject at sun, burst jammer, sensor booster, and many other things but couldnt solved...
---
ishtar is expensive to lose ( semi afk ratting), vni and myrmidon : no money...
---
So how can i fix this drone aggro problem..
---
&gt; I look forward to placing flowers on your graves in null &lt;3. 
---
Hey, newer Eve players. Take example from this old players attitude. Would make the game more interesting again.
---
yeah 200 of them can even kill a Titan!
---
give them 8 high slots and 8 bomb launchers
---
&gt; used to hire ourselves out to mining companies for pathfindind/escort
---
Uh oh. Game has changed sooo much since those days. Recommend you join some fun group to learn how the game works currently before forming old squad back together yet.
---
It is my happy place &lt;3.
---
now that's just lazy
---
Dont tell that to my tripple tanked ONI with autocannons and rlmls. Dont you dare
---
technically speaking missiles miss when they can't reach their target.
---
the trig rats are probably more dangerous tbh
---
The egg is f\*cking raw!
---
Hmm could be.

But also you need to login just once and the tracker cookie get hit from this machine.

:D (not when generating an image it's not)
---
How does mentally abusing a child make for a good story? I have lived through enough catastrophic climate events to know the scientists spouting this are STILL full of shit.
---
Right, and you want to remove from them the weapon system designed to hit large targets specifically that has terrible application against small targets, and leave them only with the weapon system that does AOE damage that can kill dozens of slow or unaware vessels at once.
---
How about instead we buff bomb damage but spread it over an area like how missiles work, make them apply based on sig radius, so they're solely an anti-capital weapon.
---
Still waiting for randomized mutaplasmid boxes

Raw eggs are fine.

Yes i know, I just pointed out that if you would spend that 50 Euro anyway to get ISK by selling PLEX, its indeed a 50% off deal
---
Whatever data you used to train this bot, it clearly wasn't the right set.
---
And yet somehow people don't seem to have a problem with that being the case in nullsex.

This pack includes 8 skins (I don't know if they are any good), so the Price of a single skin would be 6.25. Not bad IMO
---
&gt;I always had this crazy idea get in fastest ( forgot the name) interceptor fly for Jove space bookmarking your progress there.
---
Not possible. Each system is on a separate node, no matter how long you fly out you'll never reach another system. Not to mention that it would take decades going on centuries to do so even in the fastest sublight vessel.
---
In Britain I'd rather sacrifice a child than talk to someone next to me on the train.

There is no portion of Jove space that is accessible to the players.

So it's dead, Jim.

So much wrong with what you're saying. 
---
War aside, you're space is full of carebears. That want to do nothing but PVE and are 100 percent risk averse. This is the high sec mentality, and are only there to farm in complete safety. They contribute nothing to your alliance. 
---
And when you say that a roamer runs instead of fighting. I'm presuming you mean you show up with complete overkill and expect him to just fall on your sword.

Wormholes don't use cynos shit Lord. So we never could bring in anything interesting.

" Does PA take over or have more say come October? "

When the sale was announced this was what I feared most. A year of Hilmeth later and I keep hoping that somehow PA can find a way to unfuck the game because Hilmeth sure can't.
---
Blitz level 5 missions in a carrier. I have two toons with thanatos’ and max faction standing so I can decline the bad missions almost indefinitely. It took me a long time  and a decent investment to get to this point, and the income is not passive. This makes me roughly 1.2 bill an hour if I’m grinding hard. There is one mission that spawns a faction rat that can drop nice implants, so it helps to have a 3rd toon in a dramiel or something to scoop loot.
---
oddly on point for satire
---
&gt;that will make you more than a supercarrier ratting in nullsec
---
Sure. If you want to dump the cost of a dread (or more) into a cruiser that only just manages to tank and requires a fair level of manual piloting ability. That can be just yeeted out of existence with no hope of fighting back if you get a bad spawn. That leaves a trace in space that can be easily scanned and camped by anyone who comes by, who can just blow you up with no real recourse.
---

You’re ignorant at best.  I’m getting trolled at worst

I would say "surely they aren't stupid enough to do something ridiculous like that", but then I remember how they ignored hundreds of necessary balance changes and mechanical improvements in favour of a drastic all-or-nothing approach to the cancer that is free intel in low that they then reversed completely once players started getting used to it.

Crack that egg!

Buy firesales, particularly when theres a change announced and sell when the market recovers. Have made 8b in a single titan sale 2-4b flipping supers. Once you hit 100b the next 100b can take less than a month. Or multibox 10 rorquals for 1b ish per hour at very low risk in the right place

If you have any actual evidence that any of the groups still around in one form or another are botting please by all means post them in this thread.  I'll forward them to CCP myself.

BOG has no bots because it has about 5 active players and the rest being legacy spy accounts. Meanwhile your sat living under the rule of a Chinese botting ring ran by an Exec that isn't even allowed to play the game. LMFAO

&gt;Most EVE ships aren't moving erratically. They are moving at a constant velocity following a predictable path the majority of the time.
---
You think that because you are in wingspan.

Pando's first time to have another person join him on his stream and just talk a little about the game. 
---
I think that talk was interesting and maybe a couple of you guys have not seen it yet.

Enjoy and make sure to leave some feedback for future episodes of this kind of stuff?

PSA: Elo's volume gets turned up at around 20 minutes.

The "one teenager against them all" is what makes it a good story. We want to live in a world where that is possible.
---
The impact it has on her and her personal future is whole different story and I agree with you that this might end bad.
---
Scientists are a whole different story as well. All they can do is make predictions based on the data that is available and the current predictions don't look exactly good for earth, but "a lot of people you only see if they get featured in the news for a 2 min highlight if there is a debate about climate change will be affected in multiple years if we do not take steps in the next 5 years" isn't something that gets people to act.

Carrier ratting isn’t really afk though. And when you’re multi boxing carriers it can get difficult to manage, can’t even pay attention to Netflix at that point
---
Oh you lucky bastard

They already apply base on sig radius you nampty! That's why you take twice as much damage if you have your MWD on

Actve tank no good against heavy neuting of trigs. Got to go passive tanked. You can get 500-700hp/s with passive rattle, but do give up a lot of DPS for it.
---
You obviously just acting smart without any actual knowledge, any sentence of you reveals that.  Show me the Hisec sytem with 50 Bots, and furthermore show me multiple of them, you cant as you just lie to keep up your narrative. I can show you at least 10 systems in Sov-Nullsec right now, where also right now bots are running (again sadly as Local is back, during blackout they broke and I killed them). Your stubborn dumbness is just astounding ... but thats the world today
---
It's not that hard. If CCP wanted to create shield slaves to mimic the functions of armor slaves, simple solution would be to buff the max HP of shields and to nerf the regen at the same time. This would keep the shield slaves in line with armor slaves, without giving shields an edge over armor.
---
I can't believe you used Rattlesnake as an example, because it's super easy to balance this way.
---
However, shield capitals are balanced in a way that would most likely make them way too good if shield slaves were implemented and shift the meta too much, but this can be countered by giving shield capitals more shield regen and less maximum shield, if the situation would demand it.
---
Why has it been so long that CCP hasn't even discussed the possible options with the public, I'm not sure My speculations are it's because they have "more important" things to do like thinking about how to monetize the game better for their new overlord PA, which is getting more obvious year after year. Downsizing eve online's staff the past decade, instead of having the opportunity to grow, surely doesn't help the game either. It's funny how the news outlets mentioned CCP making more money than ever just few years back, but CCP probably never invested that money back to the game for it to grow.
---
Missiles have a few properties that all serve to POTENTIALLY REDUCE the damage they do. 
---
So you start off with what is listed in your fitting panel, and from there:
---
* If target ship speed &gt; missile explosion speed (NOT flight speed), damage is reduced by a factor
---
 * You lessen the damage reduction by increasing missile explosion speed with a low or mid slot missile guidance modules (mid can be scripted for better effect), rigs or implants 
---
 * alternatives: there is also 1 BCS (the damage mod) that reduces the penalty from speed. Stasis webs offer the same effect in the end
---
* If target ship signature radius &lt; missile explosion radius, damage is reduced by a factor
---
 * You lessen the damage reduction by reducing your explosion radius the same as for explosion speed, outlined above
---
 * The alternative here is the Target Painter, which increases the enemy's signature radius and thus brings it closer to your explosion radius
---
The only way to do the damage listed in the fitting screen is to shoot a ship that moves slower than your explosion speed, and is larger than your explosion radius. 
---
You do not get EXTRA damage this way, but you do your theoretical maximum (before resists, of course).
---
As others have recommended, it's best to use a software like Pyfa. Inside, you can simulate exactly what effect your missiles would have against a specific target with a given speed and signature radius, as well as how the different Missile Precision improvements and modules like webs and painters affect your damage application. 
---
To answer the questions at the end, missiles all appear to do a lot of damage because there are a lot of factors that can mitigate that damage (to partially compensate for the fact that they can't miss and otherwise do fixed damage, no grazes, wrecking shots etc.). 
---
It's best to fit these modules because otherwise you are losing potential damage and, furthermore, might end up in a situation where you thought you had enough damage to kill some ships, but you are actually not applying most of it. Best example is large T2 Fury cruise missiles and torpedoes, which deal next to no damage to frigates unless you improve application.
---
For maximum flexibility, use Missile Guidance Computers in mid slots, and scripts. If you are applying well, missile range scripts will make you do damage "faster". If you are not applying well, switch to missile precision scripts and it should fix it.
---
I can't subscribe to that. It's like you say autotune in music industry is a trend (sadly) and everyone has to use it. But guess what, that's just different styles and if you think you need to adapt to something you probably have a different problem.
---
Giving instant access to information/places/etc is a cancer of the current time. Longtime players of eve know that eve is a game of patience - just take the skill learning. Waiting. Not by progressing through the content with a boost just to see everything before the game gets boring because one is used to have instant access.
---
Do you still think instant access is good? Elaborate please your view.
---
&gt; You think that because you are in wingspan.
---
Go watch any pvp video.
---
In the time a missile takes to reach its target, 99% of ships haven't really changed velocity.
---
If people would fly more stuff that gets killed by bombs, maybe.
---
Also remove HAW guns and nerf fighter tracking, so big ships can't shoot at small ships so easy.
---
&gt; simple solution would be to buff the max HP of shields and to nerf the regen at the same time
---
Sure, but that would make this the only set that provides penalties.
---
Their
---
I think I linked the wrong one.  I was looking at an armor fit.  ug.
---
You are shit.
---
It also shouldn't be fought in capitals only. Yet here we are...
---
Yes, however that's not a problem. Is it? Some implants have penalties right now because they are balanced well that way. There's no reason why it couldn't work on implant sets either.
---
The number of ships killed dropping with the total value staying static means that the loss per ship is increasing. I guess this is a reflection of gankers having to prioritize targets more.
---
There's also a comma before an and.
---
That is just an incredibly silly statement. Even if their velocity hasn't significantly changed their vector has.
---
Fastest way to make isk in EVE is with a real life job.
---
Sure, it just hasn't yet.
---
There must be a chart on the monthly econ report that shows the velocity of isk. The faster it moves in the game, the harder it is to catch the dirty transactions from the legitimate ones. Additionally, there's multiple ways of laundering said ISK (Using corp wallets, asset transactions, the occasional "Scam", faking a ransom, etc.).
---
So yes, you might eventually get caught and banned, but its either not very likely to be in the beginning of your scheme, or you have already wrote it off and have backup accounts - made easier than ever with skill injectors &amp; alphas - to take over when a batch of bots &amp; brokers get banned.
---
AFK carrier ratting lmao
---
How to say: "Idk wtf I'm talking about" but with many, many more words.
---
I’ve been trying to use rykkis guide but it seems like the numbers don’t add up, all the fits I see for C2 sites don’t have enough Rep/DPS to cover the last wave (or something like that)
---
It is isn’t it
---
I am in a Corp, and it’s hard for me to justify spending money on games especially when there are lots of possibilities going free
---
That's actually not wrong.
---
It can be used even on lists of only 2 to clarify the end of a clause.
---
What can they do you ask? Maybe try to make changes not for whooping 10 “nullsec is safer that highsec but for some reason I never lived there and will never do it” guys? Maybe try to address reasons for nullseccers to go to wars instead? 
---
There is a lot of things which can be tried. Instead CCP tried to make minority of players be happy at the expense of majority. Understandable failed at it. Now “Era of Chaos” ended...
---
And something in orbit is moving by a known predictable vector.
---
Do you have you shift zig zag constantly through space? Click randomly every 3 seconds?
---
I haven't seen a single pvp video of someone doing that.
---
They both have shirts.
---
Hanging out with my friends, making new ones.
---
I didn't forget, it's time to start this crusade to take our holy game back from these dirty WHOTs.
---
Really? My primary school teacher is going to get a strongly worded letter.
---
"""""few"""""
---
There are a couple of sites that are harder that others. Namely, last waves on half of Data and Relic sites.
---
looks like a lot of fun!
---
lol fuck off
---
There are cheap implants that give a small percentage for missile application. They are honestly great and cost very little.
---
In this case, most style guides would probably say it's wrong, because they are dependent clauses and not independent clauses, but English is ever evolving.
---
You can buy the boosters on market if i remember correctly, might b wrong tho
---
Bro thanks! I've never seen the first ever EvE is dying. That's pretty ironic since EvE was just starting to kick off. 
---

A man of culture. Truly I aspire to be like him.

What’s the other?
---
Dread?        
---
Like fitted super is 20bil  including all fitting, implants, fighters and support chars you need to do.          
---
It is also click intensive to the point you will kill your mouse doing it.            
---
You will lose fighters doing it that are pretty expensive. 
---
Abyssal T5 **frigate ones** can be done cheaper ship 1-2bil in total with fitting - sure you can go way more into bling stuff but you have fits able to run it at this price level.        
---
You need less skillpoints for abyssals ships than for super also if you do it smart in random higsec system that no one is visiting chance of someone finding you are near 0, as your activity is not visible on ESI.              
---
Where do you find abyssal balanced?
---
I’m the same way. I actually started when they sold Eve Online retail boxed. Stopped after a while because couldn’t afford it. Somehow eve is an itch that I just can’t get off. Plus there’s so much new stuff that’s interesting.
---
The idea is that these should should be both interesting to fly and fight against in small scale engagement, and not be able to be abused too much in large n+1 doctrines.
---
It died with Farms&amp;Fields approach that heavily cheered by the CSMs at that time (80% SovNull).
---
Yea I honestly figured that was the case but it's not like there is a better browser by default tho. Soo glad to hear ff has extensions tho.. I'll be spreading the word like the damn Gospel lol 
---
I specifically don't use my phone to browser the net half the time because adds and pop ups are beyond intrusive on mobile. Hopefully this fixes that. It's funny tho I use Ublock on my PC.
---
Interesting to hear that chrome refuses extensions . Someone's getting an angry email. I assumed it was a limitation based on ram or code or something not a choice.
---
Yeah, there are a few 3rd party apps: pathfinder, tripwire, and a couple more I think.
---
You can but generally it is not correct segment of reddit to ask for fittings (not a wrong one, but this is sort of "general" eve reddit compared to specific "r/fittings" reddit). Point 3 in my message is a direct link to a place where you can create new topic and directly ask for fit like "Need PvP active tanked fit for kestrel" or "passive tanked drake for level 2-3 missions" or something along the lines, you got the general concept.  
---
As others said - pick a newbie corp (choose any - Pandemic Horde/Karmafleet/Brave/EveUniversity or any else newbie corp and join) so you\`ll get kickstarted on what is what as it is supposed to for these corporations and their people are true "tutorial" of eve online - they have numbers, they have people willing to answer your questions, some have care packages in form of skillbooks and ships and they have fleets to get you right in the best stuff of this game - PvP and all of its majestic (and not so much) fuckery. Do not mistake others newbies do by isolating yourself in high security space and running carreer missions,  it isn\`t single player game and NPCs here are players (if you get my drift) that forge their own history and more than willing to help you because ***you are their content as much as they are yours***.... and yes, they will have a bazillion fits with explanations on point by point basis regarding every single module,  just be brave and ask even stupidest questions straight away until you build your solid understanding.  
---
Cheers!
---
You're more on point than you think - since the introduction of Asset Safety, wormholes are the only place where you can actually loot the buckets (Citadels).
---
In other parts of space, the loot seeps through the floor and you don't get almost anything. 
---
So while more exposed, it's also the only place where you get to loot in the first place.
---
"Bring out dem excell-sheets, so you can clap those excell-cheeks!"
---
I'll see myself out.
---
No. Much too difficult to balance. The drekavac is already problematic in balancing regards. The difference to faction capitals is that they don't truly mess with balancing as they are very expensive. A triglavian dread would not really do a lot to the meta in general for example. On the plus side people would want to fly it just because and train the skills. (people training new skills = money for CCP = servers stay online.) Pirate battlecruisers don't add anything there because people have those skills already trained.
---
I would like them to rebalance alot of ship classes first before adding ANYTHING in to the game.
---
I was watching a video the other day that gave a little explanation about building buckets in wormholes. 
---
Homie was doing it solo so, that alone deserved a watch. But at one point during construction, the guy had to kinda just "now don't you move" some containers filled with fuel while he bounced out to get some more bits. 
---
When he got back, he discovered that some cheeky fuck had plug walked in and pinched two of the containers, completely ignoring all the unused materials just floating out there while he went on a quick run.  
---
The look on this poor guys face when he realised the math didn't add up was bliss.
---
That has kinda left an impression with wormholes for me.
---
Trust me when i say i want them but theres a powercreep problem. I'd imagine they would be around 300m for the hull and they would just be better than battleships in 99% of situations. Might be cool if they had their own flavor of command burst, eg web strength for serpentis.
---
I agree, but CCP doesn't seem to mind adding new ships. In the last year they added a whole new race with 10 ships.
---
Get Into PI. Set up 5 planets on all 3 chars and profit.. After you get Omega that is.
---
Top bar content is great tbh XD
---
its actually better to just buy that ore :P
---
And the Sansha succubus are destroyers
---
Imagine being so powerful that you breathe life into others to take pleasure in their destruction.  
---
That's the kind of person who throws gifts in EVE. :) They are good folks. Generous Gods
---
&gt; Might be cool if they had their own flavor of command burst, eg web strength for serpentis.
---
That would actually be very very interesting
---
Hi OP.
---
This was me who injected the char from new. Some skills are worth in excess of 50 bil due to them being rare and one that cost approx 150 bil.
---
It was just a bit of fun.
---
You can literaly kill a bomber with a t1 condor. Eve doesn't follow the rule "the biggest, the better". Bombers are terribly slow, can't fight sub cruiser ships, are relatively expensive.
---
iam quite sure its like half on some chinese rmt portal or whatever shizznit they use, you just wait :D
---
Some people eat them while I puke
---
No they just need to code a dead space pocket for the new player to mine.
---
Don’t let them “move your assets”....
---
Now we talk true eve xD
---
See my reply in this thread.
---
It's not a good price, at all.
---
He's probably playing second galaxy.
---
But faction BS exist.. 300 mil for hull is a lot compared to a t1 bs.
---
Chinese have a seperate server? I thought all players are on tranq?
---
In Germany as well. I never board the train without my inears
---
Credit card. Srsly, if you just want to fund you omega, pay for the sub and enjoy the PVP with money you farm any way you like. 
---
Unless you enjoy working in the virtual field for pennies an hour.
---
Too much efford for ccp, thats the core problem, hell they cant even fix shit they broke,don't give em any new ideas how to shit up the game!
---
Hence the real reason Eve is dieing and cant be saved, our generation has grown up, had kids and has no time for games.
---
The new generation aren't into big old subscription mmo's.
---
The missile+drone thing doesn’t effect application, only damage and you can’t abyssal roll either of the application mods for missiles
---
There are two official servers, the global one that we all play on and the Chinese server, Serenity. 
---
The reason for that is the Chinese government not allowing its citizens to communicate and play with outside influences. The Chinese who play with us have to use a VPN to avoid the Chinese government from cracking down.
---
This is pretty much a useless website.
---
It's just a little picture graph, there's no listing of what they plan on changing and more so no voting in submitting ideas of what players want to see changed.
---
I had high hopes originally when they launched this but was sadly disappointed.
---
Something Something Signed for auction on next eve-fanfest :P
---
well sure, but if we start having to do stuff like feed rookie ships worth of plex to launder isk, and then lose some more to bans every now and again, we're looking at losing 50-60% of our isk to ccp before RMT, meaning we're down to making $600/mo on top of operating expenses.
---
Full ship balance pass, then add in faction fun stuff to fill voids that exist. We don't have some combinations nor do we have a pirate miner ship. Get on it.
---
never bite a hand that feeds you
---
At the very least, we have learned that EvE will not die of starvation, thirst possibly but not starvation!
---
its too late, they shouldn't be added in the first place
---
Pretty sure https://o.smium.org/ died.
---
....and then he lost everything moving stuff in the mark5 itheron through Rancer....
---
Unfortunately I'm not working poor student so I can't afford buying plex at the moment. And finally I'm totally fine with the grind in this game.
---
This is a neat idea. Even with a pretty small number value, this sort of thing could have a big impact in fights.
---
Yes.
---
Even if it does taste similar, the headache is certainly worse.
---
Learn PI.. seriously.. seeing up a good PI farm can pay your sub. Don't worry about farming the isk.
---
But more to your question. Rattler then Loki. Rattler is a bit easier to skill into and can clear almost all the pve in the game solo with enough sp and the right fit.
---
I used mine to farm 6/10s before I left NS. Also yes scanning may be boring but it's the easiest isk in the game easy 100m per site give or take, But some people just enjoy scanning like me.. wher btw. 
---
Loki is my second option honestly because it's broken atm and you should probably get one. Something like 800-900 dos with webs and battleship level tank... Yea thanks ccp..
---
But as another said don't try to play for your sub unless you know where and how to make isk. To a degree it seems like you do. NS makes it pretty easy tho. But I agree the game is more fun when your not worrying about your next "months rent" lol.
---
You’re already training into missiles and drones, rattlesnake is a fine ship.
---
Sounds like a group thing.
---
Think of a BNI with Serp bonuses. Oh yeah baby, hull tanked brick cannon time.
---
Unsubscribing is best for ratting.
---
Then I would say Rattle, and a good selection of educational YouTube channels (or a stolen Netflix sub). Cheap vodka will be very helpful as well. Get into null with any of the crab nullocks and crab your heart out. Or into a WH corp, whichever works for you. Heck, you don't even need a Rattle, get a crapfit Dominix, it's easier to replace. 
---
The reason why I don't recommend any of it, is that's there's 90% chance you'll get sick of this shit and quit before actually getting any real PVP done.
---
Remember that time everyone wanted skins like chineese servers
---
Bombers are the reason battleship fleets are no longer a thing. Bombers are so strong an entire meta shifted cause of them.
---
Meeting the best gaming community in the world in person. :-)
---
Never not shoot blues
---
Yes, this. I played LoL a bit the other day, and was reminded just how toxic other games' "communities" can be. EVE is full of sass and salt, but very few actual toxins.
---
Bombers should be split, a covert ops bomber and a covert ops Torpedo craft. 
---
1 ship shouldnt have the flexability of being able to destroy subs with bombs, destroy caps with Torps, be able to drain the cap on any ship and still have frigate align time and sig, t2 resists and be able to cloak.
---
Splitting the ship into a dedicated bomber (Can fit  Bomb Launchers but no ability to fit Torps) and a dedicated Covert Torp Boat (Can fit Torps and is bonused for them. But cant fit a bomb launcher) is a better approach.
---
your napkin mafs are a bit off mate. feeding plexboats is a meme.
---
Mate what
---
They need to split he team in half and go half and half new content and balancing old. They will get into a state of perpetual balance if they can't get anything new out. And new stuff shakes current stuff up. Observatories anyone? Fixes local?! Lol 
---
Ccp rise basically said so himself on talking in stations. *Can't get the link but it's out there* to sum him up their in a rut and chaos is their way of getting out of it. Reading into it a bit.
---
That being said your absolutely right they need to fix alot of stuff. Fausets, T1 mats to some extent, and alot of sov/station stuff.. not even counting ships.. like OMG the Loki/Proteus right now.
---
What we plan to fix: 
---
The game
---
What we've done so far:
---
Fixed things.
---
I swear to god, I will purchase a thousand ibis for the pocket space before I willingly fly that abomination. 
---
Besides, I feel like there is some bootleg strategy here to get goods from point A to point B, based purely on the idea that "well yeah, but I got more ibis than you have patience so, go nuts".
---
I could also just be a hopeless dreamer.
---
Out of most multiplayer games I've played, EVE Online has the least toxic community by a far.
---
I mean they already have it for supers it would be nice to get some subs to get cute tricks
---
Never mind making videos. Get in fleet. :Colbert:
---
They're all mindlessly scrolling Instagram anyway, not texting friends and family 24/7.
---
Sure, let's remove torps and make bombs require contact. And for good measure, let's buff the bomb damage to somewhere around 100-500k.
---
You are supposed to reprocess the loot that drops in and are apparently lame rewards (e.g. overdrive x 4) from previous and parallel career agent missions. If you loot the field during those missions and save your lame rewards, you will not find yourself short.
---
EVE is more complicated than other games, so EVE players should have slightly more braines
---
Alpha should be thought of as a trial, not the full game. People were never meant to be alpha players (which is why there was no such thing until a couple of years ago), it's just a way to get people to try it out so that they can commit to subscribing. If they gave alphas access to the most interesting features (and mining), they wouldn't provide much incentive to do that. Most of what people do in wormholes either requires a subscription or is very difficult without one.
---
It's also extremely difficult to live in a wormhole on your own even with the features (not part of the trial) which make it possible. So if your corp doesn't have one, you have to find a corp which does.
---
Fucking Hilmar only cares about his raise and does nothing to fix these bullshit grammatical errors.
---
Someone quickly produce a meme, preferably a Simpson's meme.
---
&gt; so EVE players should have slightly more braines
---
And then we have people like Olmeca and StainGuy.
---
Thanks for the replying! I was told that its much easier to train well skilled t3 rather than well skilled rattle is it false? And why Loki over tengu? I heard tengu can easily solo c3 / 10/10 / L4 and much more but I've never heard something similar regarding Loki in pve. And btw, as I know Loki isn't missile based ship (am I right?) so assuming mine close to zero gunnery and laser skills is it still a good option for me?
---
I would rather say EVE community is just the most tolerant to the things like scumming, PVP, lying and betrayal
---
Get the feeling he hates everything wormhole cause he doesnt ***understand*** them.

Wormhole space - Best space

Huh, I hadn't noticed that. Fair enough.

haha, in a large family not without a .. still 99% of awesome people in the game!
---
Yeah. Others are also outdated or replaced by better versions.
---
For example Rykki's Guides: Wormhole PvE (v. 1.12) should now be [Karr's Modified Rykki's Guide 1.2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml#). Better version of the ammo quick reference is  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aedo66/projectile\_ammo\_overview/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aedo66/projectile_ammo_overview/)  (versions for the other guns exist too). It's also not really a guide but a reference sheet. As a guide maybe reference  [https://ashyin.space/category/how-2-krab/](https://ashyin.space/category/how-2-krab/)
---
NPC damage/resists isn't needed anymore as it's present ingame and more precise (there are many exceptions to the damages in quick reference thingies.)
---
The [Inter-faction Relationships and Standing](http://www.newedenlibrary.net/eon/faction_standings.shtml) link leads to a dead website.
---
A nice PvE quick reference sheet which is missing:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ayw3lo/abyssal\_deadspace\_cheat\_sheet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ayw3lo/abyssal_deadspace_cheat_sheet/)  (at least I did not see it above)
---
I better stop going through that stuff...
---
Yeah. Like a 3rd party site is going to make a problem out of getting more sales...
---
Damnit how is this not top comment lmao
---
officer damage control now.
---
Sorry to sound so gloomy but good luck living in a wormhole without proper scanning skills and no ability to use a cloaking device. It's possible but doesn't mean it should be done.
---
Yeah I've heard about dominix but I'm looking for higher-end ship to skill into. I already can handle null combat sites/c2 or even c3 with my 240 mil praxis fit or Gila but I want something more consistent and fast-clearing. 
---
Regarding getting sick of game - I'm playing path of exile (arpg diablo-like game) a lot so I'm very familiar with huge amounts of monotonous grind so its really fine for me. Even more if I can do it semi afk watching movie on my second screen or listening music etc.
---
I bought millions of contaminated lorentz fluid for ~800 isk back in 2009 assuming ccp would make it useful someday.  I was right :-D
---
If there's no roadmap at Vegas I'm going to be incredibly worried for the future of the game. 
---
I've never been one to say EVE is dying, I feel like that's counterproductive and I highly doubt the ~60% of the game that just levels up their Raven in hisec would keep CCP in the black until the end of time, but it sure as fuck feels like it's on life support right now.
---
Wait for the feeling of your first legit solo kill !
---
This post is also shit...
---
The Rifter model came from the EVE Collector's Edition box
---
yes boss
---
Loki can go missiles also check it's sub systems. it's just as good as the tengu if not better these days its honestly broken. It can run everything you've mentioned. 10/10s are probably a bit hard on it I think it has a little less raw tank than a max tengu but the webs vs frigs make up for it imo. I ran a rattle and Loki for 6/10s just for clear times either could solo it. I've also used all three in a c3 and Loki wins hands down webs OP.
---
Idk about time vs rattler I know there is more sp in a great rattle than a tengu yea but most of the skills cross over. To even sit in a tengu is like a month. Rattle is at least usable right away *almost*

---
Yeah this is basically what I use. Rhmls and a gecko. Grappler and tp. Faction xl shield boost. Resistances. The rest is flux Coils, CCCs and whatever else to make it stable. Getting almost 90% resists where I want them, 1k DPS, and perma rep for 275+ p/s and I have mediocre shield skills.
---
Only complaint is rhml's take forever to reload and gecko needs to be babysat because they cost plenty for something easy to lose.
---
Fireworks
---
My man lol
---
Triglavian ships work on the spool up mechanic, it's not like they added a new line of, say, missile ships for example. Trig ships are a new line, not a mish mash.
---
Yeah assuming how broken webs are with missiles it makes sense now. Which missile type should I train then? I already have light missiles rank 5 (trained for gila) Cruise and heavy at rank 3
---
I know Lilies are traditional for graves but I'd  like to request blue Peonies. Thx!
---
Only Reddit is toxic
---
As someone who does what you're looking to do, go astero for explo and income while you skill into a tengu.  For running sites/explo tengu is best across all roles, where as the rattle is best for dps/tank but hella slow and Loki just kinda lacks imo compared to a shieldy tengu
---
Ex test, can confirm. Large amounts of questionable opsec
---
Battleships are not being used cause you cant get them places, if you do you cant get them out and they simply dont have any significant advantage over hacs when it comes to killing subcaps.
---
Bombers are easily countered by most subcap doctrines actually.
---
i have all but the megathron which is harder to find
---
Thanks it was as it is known, a shit post.
---
They do, but its negligible.
---
Heavy and assaults. Just heavy maybe cruise if going rattle.
---
With the Loki damage type dosent matter so you have some options on ammo to use unlike tengu and rattle that must be kin or therm for rat.
---
I was doing astero null explo for last 2 months and found it to be very unfun and tedious for me. Can't wait to try out t3/rattle
---
Pls no
---
Clearly CCP Convict doesn't play enough Eve if any amount of salt still makes him nauseous. :D
---
Can make a few bil a day if you're munching good nullsec moon goo. Personally I run carrier l5s in lowsec and pull around 400m an hour if not a bit more.
---
Buh, you wannt get flexed on?
---
1RM comp at the sun?
---
I'm really sick of these classic eve request posts
---
What's the difference between heavy and assaults? Looks like assaults are just less dps with less range compared to heavy
---
More DPS less range.
---
T3 I'd say is better than rattle in that case.  Rattle is great but for learning leaves you very vulnerable and you will get ganked.  T3 opens a bit more grace, but higher SP requirement.  Could do both?
---
ah, yes!
---
I’d vote no injectors/excavator drones but yes to triglavian stuff.
---
Yes, it is isk neutral, mining itself does not directly create new isk that is put into the eve economy. Isk only trades between player hands. 
---
Mining is not material neutral though. Mining creates new minerals that are put into the eve economy.
---
Second Galaxy's p2w is apparently a lot cheaper than EVE's.
---
Turn it back to a time when not every retard had a super, titan, rorq, fax, combo. A time where you actually had to have some sense to wield these. 
---
Also a time with combat refitting.
---
+1 for just removing parts of the game, make it a true chaos era.
---
Are we ever going to see something similar return?
---
They have micro jump drives. Maelstroms still have super alpha strikes. They have great buffers too...
---
Yet 20 bombers can delete an entire battleship fleet. 
---
I agree battleships are too slow and dont have a niche anymore.
---
Well, yes. Ratting is not technically material neutral because of the wrecks it creates, but you get the idea.
---
Yea +1 for just remove injectors and have rorqs how they used to be.
---
:thumbs\_up:
---
Lol. Gonna bait you inside of my van with candy (DEDs):)
---
I definitely will try them both someday but now I want to stick to one of them and I feel like t3 is more forgiving to play as newbie so atm after reading these advices I'm 90% sure about choosing Loki/tengu
---
hedliner taking pictures from the bus and posting them in -10.0 alliance discord chat be like

they go for nearly double that on the bay of e's.

This is the biggest load of bullshit Ive heard. You are literally saying "either accept bad changes or dont get any  changes at all". Thats fking BS dude. You should never reward any company for doing bad things because it will become the norm and we would never ever have received any good changes in the future.
---
Thats what just got stopped. The impact from the players made sure that CCP never try this shit again (atleast for while.
---
And if you really believe your own BS then man..
---
As we mindlessy scroll reddit :thinking:
---
MJD, cruise missiles with Sentry drones if active ratting.
---
Bring back conquerable stations in sov null.          
---
All other structures can be destroyed and have one 24 to 56h timer.           
---
Moon mining is moved back to structures with single 20 to 28h timer.
---
I want classic r/Eve back.
---
Cymek posts, memes about people not being aware of changes to ships, battle reports that are worth reading.
---
balance changes complete.  since the game is balanced now, they won't have to revisit till at least 2022.
---
I mean he made one yesterday as well
---
Agreed.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
 ^*Bitch*.
---
Holy ballz thats some serious bullshit over there
---
 Cymek posts were great.
---
So you really fully believe that we would in the future all of the sudden get great changes if we accepted these shitty changes now? I mean are you drunk? Listen to your own reasoning. No person works this way and no company works this way. If you let someone slide once they will sure as shit do it again.
---
If you want happy customers then you actually fking need to invest. There are no other ways around this. Ever.
---
If you believe in something, you work on it everyday!!!
---
so much effort on something ccp does not give a shit about, well played
---
PI on all 3 chars. Get on it
---
I hear you could always put in a bit of effort and kill off those pesky mining fleets.

Lol dude this game has the best community for welcoming new players. I just started out and I`m like a week in and legit the first day I joined some guy randomly gave me 50mil isk without ever speaking to him. A couple of days later again a random guy just messaged me and we were talking about random stuff and he decided to teach me how to rat and I basically tagged along while he killed everything off so I could loot and salvage got another 20mil orso by just fucking around. Today some guy in WH space blew me up and messaged me afterwards why I didn't jump away and I said that I didn't know how the Dscan worked so he explained all that stuff to me and gave me 10mil as a sorry. First time I'm invested in a mmorpg and this is the welcome I got so I can't complain :) 
---
Still got a fuckton to learn though.
---
or just eve mail them like a normal functioning human being trying to reach out.
---
Sigh. I just bought a Meteor pack a few days ago...

aw the cute little attention seeking retard wants to be a spai now

 [https://zkillboard.com/character/1101618242/](https://zkillboard.com/character/1101618242/) 
---
Judging by that character's killboard and the killboards of the other members, who i can assume are her alts given the information you've given us. i'd guess that they either no longer play, or play on a different set of characters. 
---
I'd suggest, provided you remember any of her other friends, ask if she had an alt or if she outright quit.
---
I wish you the best of luck finding them! I have just reunited with an old buddy of mine I met through runescape just a few months ago after 2-3 years of looking. Here's hoping you have better luck than I did!
---
It's balanced now? Awesome. Brb restarting my subs.
---
The reason I asked is because at the time T3 was the way to go, I haven't got a clue what a praxis is
---
SISTERS OF EVE DESTROYER THAT CAN CLOAK PLEASE AND THANK YOU
---
And with that last sentence, you neglected the first one and repeated what I said
---
If you generate something of value from nothing, you generate isk, in whatever form it might be
---
u/ccp_falcon Unironically, can we have a client like this please? In addition, of course, to the full client. 
---
I want to play on this client so bad it hurts.
---
this idea is braindead jesus christ.
---
This brings me back to my early days working in the video game industry. Developers would get so pissed when I bugged their terribly spelled, terribly punctuated, and grammatically incorrect text; however, I would sass them back and tell them basically what you just said. Some errors, even if the do not effect game play, are going to make your game seem like an unprofessional joke and cause people to stop playing.
---
Drop eve and focus on your studies
---
Thats illegal and counter productive. I hope it doesn't come to that. Cities of Heroes shutdown and its taken them years to try and rebuild the server tech. They've only just started hosting private servers near feature parity this year.
---
send me your char name and i will contract you a few i have collected over the years for free. you only need to pick them up in some hisec system(s) if thats ok with you.  
---
need their ammo too? like snowballs and such?
---
Hey! Welcome to the game! I guess you are pretty new? I will take this opportunity to shamelessly plug my corporation which happens to be recruiting:) in the botom of my corp add you will find an ingame channel name. if you join this channel we can have a talk about what you want ingame and if we could be a fit. you could also just pm me and we can take it from there.

Lucifer’s Own is a newly formed corporation for casual players who are looking for a place to call home. In Lucifer’s Own, you have the opportunity to play the game in many ways. We understand that not all players are able to dedicate a lot of time to Eve. We want to create an easy no barrier corporation with a focus on PvP. We will not be owning anything so no mandatory ops to conquer, destroy or defend.
---
We welcome all pilots no matter their skill points and account status. The most important characteristic of a pilot is the wish to PvP together and have fun whilst doing that.
---
We run gatecamps, cruiser roams, frigate roams, Black Ops would be cool in the future.
---
What we are:
---
Friendly with leadership with a decade of experience.
---
A start up corporation. Meaning we are building something together
---
EUTZ PvP
---
A group that finds satisfaction in blowing things up!
---
What we are not:
---
An elite PvP corp with CTA’s
---
In an alliance and probably never will be
---
Looking to merge with another corporation
---
We are looking for:
---
PvP pilots or weekend Warriors
---
Pilots who want to learn to PvP.
---
Pilots who are willing to help build up a corporation
---
Pilots who can be on comms when we are in a fleet
---
If this sounds good to you message Mikhos or join ‘’Lucifer’s Own Pub’’ in-game channel and ask what you can do to join.
---

---
I think the key of reddit is picking and curating a few subreddits that you have vested interest in. Then spend time clicking/reading what...oh fuck I clicked on all again.
---
When you spend a big chunk of the play time playing just so you can play more, you will get sick of it. It's not even close to \*grind for something interesting in another game\* 
---
It's just work for the sake of doing more work. 
---
And as for why Dominix over Rattle.. You will get caught eventually, and lose that Rattle,as well as most of the ISK invested in it.  Dominix is dirt-cheap, enough to not even care about being killed. 
---
Actually no, fuck me and my big mouth, get the Rattle and don't forget to make it active. I hope I'll be the one to collect the salt.
---
It's exactly the same dumb shit you see in r/eve, but on Facebook
---
Fight them. That's the point of their existence, they're not background decoration.
---
Only if you are in a timezone close to downtime and can live with having a bad standing to the NPCs that own the region you are living in...
---
lmao. Btw can you tell me please whats wrong with active rattle? (No trolling pls)
---
It would definitely be centuries. Lots of centuries.
---
Did you even read what he said?
---
In sov null they have been known to mine so much ore that there isn't enough left in the system to hit industry level 1.
---
For C3, rattle is the best, but only if you live somewhere with a C3 static. If you have to travel or want to day trip, T3c are better
---
&gt; You are literally saying "either accept bad changes or dont get any changes at all". Thats fking BS dude
---
It´s neither about bad nor good changes. It´s about acceptance of substantial change at all. To test that you need to make sure you actually have a sample that predominantly stresses this point. To lift Eve out of stagnation substantial change is neccessary that will ultimately effect a lot of paying customers. Many of them in inconvenient ways. CCP tested the waters and found out that their customers are not willing to put up with such changes. Large investments to turn around a stagnating game with a dwindling playerbase hence seem like a risky option. 
---
People thought they were kinda joking or mocking the playerbase when they released their post blackout statement saying they collected a lot of valuable data on how to progress from here on out. They really weren´t though.   
---
&gt;The impact from the players made sure that CCP never try this shit again
---
Oh, don´t worry, they won´t.
---
Eve vegas is mostly just a venue and an excuse to get eve nerds in a room together.  Some people go for the keynotes and speakers, but I'd say the majority come to just hang out with people they interact with online all the time, but never get to meet in person otherwise.  As awful as we can be to eachother ingame, 99.9% of us are great fun out of game, even to our bitterest of enemies.  You guys should have a blast!
---
Also damn he's really good at those legos!
---
You have to make a distinction, though, between generating isk and generating value. Generating value, is doing something that creates something of worth. So, mining, ratting, basically any pve activity in the game. However, generating isk is more specific. When you generate isk, you create NEW isk that has not ever been in the economy before. So, isk generation includes ratting, and selling blue loot to NPCs.
---
This distinction means that, while mining does create value in the form of ore, it does not create isk. Any isk you earn from selling ore, is isk that has already existed in the eve economy, it is NOT new isk.
---
"Away from keyboard carrier ratting" = 5 words
---
"I do not know what the fuck I am talking about" = 11 words
---
Yes... you used many more words than I did.
---
Thanks - that makes me think we should join an alliance and start meeting more people in game over the next month before we go.
---
In EVE we understand that other people being bad makes you look slightly less bad
---
Maybe 25-30 last decade.
---
when you get to reach your hyperion goal and need someone to 1vs1 with in jita or something hit me up!  
---
im complete shite when it comes to 1vs1 so this oughta be funny.  
---
hell i will let you even decide what battleship i should use, except the scorpion or something bad like that :P
---
What's the ETA on models? I recall CCP posting or the chinese company posting that they and CCP were negotiating. You do know we want to buy models, so what's stopping it happening?
---
Eve Vegas is hosted in the conference area of a casino, and there have been years where people under 18 couldn't even attend the conference events.
---
I really really hope this has changed, but you might want to reach out to customer support and make sure. This has resulted in some heart break before.
---
Yikes, I will check.  The good thing is he's nearly 5'10" now and looks older than he is.  Dressed properly I doubt he'd get stopped.
---
64 bit client has better performance so it should be better for multiboxing, no?
---
Use the menu Social -&gt; Channels, and type in English recruitment. Groups post adverts there, and perhaps you will find one for you.
---
Nothing is wrong with it really. As long as nobody brings out a good, thick, long neut :D
---
The problem with all of those ships, is that they are extremely expensive. The first rule of Eve is don't fly what you can't afford to lose, and if you're trying to grind up 1.8 bil a month for omega, then its unlikely you can afford a half bil loki/tengu loss, and you definitely can't afford a 1.5 bil rattle loss (don't poorfit a faction battleship).
---
Use an Ishtar if you want to do nullsec pve, it runs havens/forsaken hubs well, and if fit right it can do some escalations.
---
he definitely can't do the nightclub thing, but I didn't think there was any issue with the conference area itself in previous years.  Never hurts to check though.
---
I don't believe it was a thing they were concerned about when I went last year, you should be able to go with him to all the talks and such. Just won't be able to go on the pub crawl or the party, since there is a whole lot of drinking involved in those, and he wouldn't be able to get inside.
---
Only been to G-Fleet in Berlin, this year, so, not a lot of experience,  but my take was... a bunch of mostly awkward computer geeks meet up and talk about the game.  There is food and a place to sit and eat and chat. There is a stage where someone talks and shows game-related stuff for intertainment. There is late night party (with alcohol, so, not for children). And that is it. You get to meet people and chat and may be see some cool presentations.
---
Or you can be a risk averse pvp and either don't undock if you don't outnumber your opponent, or simply run when some other ships decloak on grid and you realize youve been baited.
---
There are plenty ways.
---
Yeah, we didn't buy tickets for that at all.
---
Yeah, effort and dev time. CCP cannot even commit to Angel capitals, which they already sunk dev into.
---
He can stay with the wife while I go to those.  :)
---
Got it ;)
---
Hope so, but not my call!
---
I'd buy the shit out of new ship models! :D
---
Lmfao that's brilliant.
---
Definitely.  Best piece of advice I have is don't be too attached to the corp you guys are currently in.  Any alliance that would let you keep a 2 man corp instead of making you guys move into an existing corp is  probably not worth joining.  EVE is about community, and it doesn't do you nor the alliance any good to have barriers between integrating into their community.  Join a corp in an alliance, join their discord and their voice coms, if you don't like them leave and try another.  Repeat until satisfied.
---
Gankbears, ha! There is a term I have been searching for for a long time.
---
In complete fairness, you should just be aware that the overall culture of Eve meet ups tends to involve a lot of drinking and other adult activities. CCP itself used to be fairly infamous in the game industry for hosting some of the wildest industry  parties around (though they have toned that down in recent years). I’m sure you’ll have a good time, but just be aware that Eve get togethers are not traditionally “kid friendly.”
---
If you want a group that's fun to integrate yourself with come join Brave, we are very new-player friendly and always have a good showing at these events.

---
Not been to EVE Vegas. Veteran of 7 Fanfests in Iceland.
---
What should you expect to see:
---
\- many, *many* nerds
---
\- the consumption of alcohol, sometimes even in a reasonable fashion
---
\- nerds nerding out on a very deep level about details of the lived EVE Online experience
---
\- enthusiastic concerts \[typically with very good music\]
---
\- roundtables discussing new and upcoming features
---
\- [EVE news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQU4bf2PaL8) keynotes
---
\- I would expect some gambling given the Las Vegas context
---
\- whores and other strumpets, but that would be outside the EVE Online context
---
There are typically not very many young players, as this is not a game that is widely enjoyed by the teenage demographic \[those would typically enter the game through parents, as in your case\]
---
I can only recommend visiting an EVE Online meeting. It’s an adult environment with adult conversation \[if you’re shy about the vibrant use of f-bombs and other vituperation, you might want to adjust your expectation\]. These are typically articulate, considerate, smart and passionate people, talking with authority, experience and at times quite heated debate \[if you want to bind a number of EVE players, say something along the lines of “[ship.name](https://ship.name) with with ship.fitting is the best way to engage with your.preferred.EVE.content. That statement is more likely than not to start a conversation that will last until the heat death of the universe\].

Go for it!

Used to love flying interceptor duty for fleets a fair while ago.  
---
Jumping into gatecamps to scout for your fleet, angling your approach on sniper tempests and the daredevil trying to tackle BE Ravens when they were in your space.  
---
  
---
Good times, and I envy your fresh outlook on fleets and pvp in general.  
---
Happy hunting.
---
I keep wanting to get back into it again, but I don't want to get sucked back into the Intel gathering again... So much time burned on that...
---
Fair enough.  I created the corp just for me and kids as they were younger and I wasn't sure about their interaction with others.  They're getting older though now so I'm less worried.
---
Allow me to introduce the best newbro corp.
---
EVE University! I know that starting off with a new corp sounds cool, but it'll be hard.
---
We have all the stuff you need for starting off. Guides, wiki, forums... Everything. Actually, most EVE players use our wiki for third party knowledge pool. And... Trust me, we know what we're doing(lol do we) we have 14 years of this under our belts! 
---
Seriously though, there is no safer alternative than EVE University for starting out. There are many starter Nullsec groups such as Brand Newbros, Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde, etc. Not saying they're bad(they are actually great for entry into Sov-Null), but they are really for people who know what they wanna do. We take those who really don't know yet.
---
We try to give as much of a spread out experience as possible, we have 'campuses' in Hisec, Lowsec, Nullsec, and even Wormholes! These areas are pretty much hubs for our corp in small pockets of New Eden, where most fleets are formed and where people generally like to hang out in.
---
For real though, you will NOT regret joining us. I regreted my own adventure into starter corps as a new guy, had no idea what to do or if I wanted to do what they wanted. So I left, searching for a better starting area. Then I found this damn corp. I have been here for over a year and a half and I've still got stuff to learn! 
---
If you choose to join us(YOU SHOULD), I can personally guide you through(if I'm online). This you will not regret.
---
i already have 3 spy accounts you fucking mong
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University
---
Yeah, so in addition to you not knowing anything about carrier ratting, you're also flat out retarded.
---
But fuck it, I like playing games and since you believe that 16 words is *more* than your wall of idiocy...
---
"From a quick bit of Google, it seems that safe math works out to about 100 mil per hour for a single Rorqual out mining or a single Carrier out ratting. So in a single day of AFK, that one ship would bring in 2.3 Bil which is almost enough to buy 2 months of PLEX.
---
Use that to set up 2 more accts to sit in their own Rorqs or Carriers, and the next day you've brought in 6.9 Bil... Those 3 pilots could make 150 Bil is 3 weeks.
---
If you really had 8 alts going, you'd be making 18.4 Bil per day, and you'd have 150 Bil for "stuff" every 8 days.
---
And that... is why they try to do stuff like Blackout to reduce the torrent of ISK pouring into the market. And why all the Rorq and Carrier pilots were crying big fat tears about having their income hampered." 
---
# = 147 words.
---
yeah you can and thats what i did but obviously that is missing the point of these tutorials for new players
---
No. Just no.

yeha you can just buy the cap boosters too but thats missingthe point of these tutorials for new players
---
They're so much fun - plus vegas is great because there's lots more he can do that's interesting too.
---
Nice ad. Tbh though I'm adverting too... But if he's new, I think it'a better for him to join a newbro corp like eve uni or pan fam.
---
Well I'm glad his mom is coming too then.  :)
---
This was a great review, thank you!

They didn't fix it - I'm repressively using directx 9 after giving up on support.

---
&gt;Rattle is heavy, well-tanked with decent damage but it's pretty much a Netflix boat.
---
Why the hell would you afk rat in a rattle when it's not cheap and you need to switch targets with missiles/your gecko/drones can get fucked up?
---
Both the times I started Eve fresh I was given considerable items from older players.  I like to return the favor.  What might be an hour for me might be a month for a newer player.
---
If your son is not playing eve then he might be a bit bored or lost.  
---
As i just read that he does play eve, then he shoudl have a great time.  He will hear all baout the new stuff coming, meet devs and others and he might even get to play demos of things (last year they had the nova demo to play, year before that we got to play Eve Asention which i think is a fialed mobile game at this point, year before that was hands on valkryie and before that was hands on spark)
---
The store is a good place to get swag.  Its a lot of fun, for eve fans.
---
Incursions are going to be reliable cash. Minimum of about 100m isk/hour, and the minimum battleships fits are fairly cheap, ~200-300m for both TDF and WTM.
---
https://wl.warptome.net/fits/ WTM fits (runs more often generally, but slower fleets)
---
and the mailing list for TDF is, I think, TDF-HQ FITS
---
Tuskers is better than ever. We are deffinetly seeing huge numbers in eutz. Nothing to see here.
---
That's why people do tags and epic arcs.
---
I still feel that we are ether in a rebuild phase or they are setting up 'EVE 2'  It seems most new stuff is band aids and we have had an actual real expansion since Incarna.  Though triglavian space was really close it felt like it was missing something.
---
I'd love a road map, but i have an odd feeling they are going to let eve limp along and either drop a sequel or they are doing a full rewrite that will 100% change everything.  
---
But who knows at this point.
---
BS will not Track a Hac to any decent Degree, negating there DPS/alpha advantage.
---
A BS has ok buffer but easily beaten by a ADC Hac
---
A bs is a turd to move, ongrid and moving to a target System (NMs and Machs are a bit of an excuse towards this so they are used a bit)
---
A BS does not outrange a Hac in most cases.
---
Every Doctrine has MJD with command dessies and the LAST thing you want is to have people to MJD themselfs in fleets, it will spread them over a giant area. Maybe to flee but thats about it. You see the problem now?
---
Bombers did not Delete BS meta, CCP did. 
---
Also capitals shit all over BS while hacs can kinda deal with them
---
You're damn lucky. This is so exclusive at this moment.
---
Shoot the frigate with cruise missiles with no application.  Shoota frigate with application mods.  Will die a lot faster in the second scenario.
---
I just use a shitfit praxis in a C3. Sure, its a bit slower - but since its out WH we generally have hole control, and even if I do lose it, its ~200m.
---
Compared to a ~1.6b rattle, I think its worth it. You're normally more limited by number of sites in your WH than by time since any you don't clear now you can clear tomorrow, so being a bit slower doesn't cost much. I'd do that over risking a rattle if the cost of a rattle could be a month of omega.

You know, I absolutely hate grinding. I am all about that self gratification. A "selfish lover of life" if you will. 
---
But, eve has been the only game I've ever played, where I genuinely enjoyed the grind, and I honestly believe it's because of the "the galaxy is your play thing, go stir the pot" mechanics that I genuinely feel like I'm not constrained to just basic resourcing like every other sandbox world ever.

While totally unrealistic, it's not outside the realms of possibility for myself and a group of others to secret build a titan, and just casually toss it in a direction I choose because "why not?".

Im not sure where you are from, you sound American. Every country I've been outside of the US, you generally don't randomly talk to people. In a lot of places (especially when you go more east in the world) randomly talking to people is something only con men or people that want to take advantage of you do. It may sound odd, but the US, Canada 'manners' (north american continent) is quite the oddity to most people.

I'm glad you said that, because I went out and bought a fucking notebook today as a part of my prep kit.

Thanks! If you know any good pilots who would be willing to fc or join a fleet to help new players it would be much appreciated.

Why?
---
I remember when a high sec Corp I was in was WarDec'd and stomped by a PvP Corp.  Afterward, they took the time to teach us about how to best deal with a similar situation in the future and even took some of our members out on PvP roams, myself included.  
---
It says something about the community when you come out of the mlm other side of a beat down feeling better for the experience.
---
At least I can purchase some school books .
---
I think the reason why people on cell phones are bad is because humans are just more than words. It takes a lot of experience of communication to people to be able to understand and interpret human behaviours. You don't learn how to read facial expressions through text. You don't learn how to talk to a crowd of people through text. You don't learn how to talk to the opposite sex or potential partner (especially if you're trying to court them) through just text.
---
You need to be able to comprehend and interpret human social actions. Unless you're a really charismatic person, you're going to be a social inept hobo if you don't understand human behaviours and experience it.

Tldr, if you really want to learn, just go join a Corp that is doing what you are interested in doing, and dive in. Take the leap of faith, and learn as you go.
---
Just my two cents... Listen to me, (more likely) down vote me idgaf.
---
It's a whole different mindset and has to be learned from the community. I was pretty bitter about my first ever loss but just yesterday I got dogpiled by some nerds from Did He Say Jump and I only experienced FUN.
---
...and TREACHERY! He said he would leave my ECM drones alone! :(
---
Will he get a free sabre BPO for that?
---
False
---
I think it has to do with accepting that this is going to be part of the landscape of allowed player behavior, so we cheerfully overlook it unless it makes things less fun.
---
Other games' communities could be this way, but EVE is the only one I know of where hardening up and accepting an unpleasant turn of events is so integral to the game experience.
---
I think the long term plan is for them to remove the 32 bit client, you might have to look into upgrading your PC for more RAM because there's no telling when they might pull the plug. That would be my guess a to why they're "forcing" 64 bit.
---
Welcome back btw. If you need anything hit me up so I can deny you in person:)
---
Sounds just like null.
---
I recently read that you can lessen the effects from sodium-overdosing with mild cheese. And there is lots of cheese in r/eve, too. Dunno if thats coincidence or if there is a plan behind that...
---
"HTFU!" :D
---
&gt;What is a WHOT?
---
I guess the WoW Classic nostalgia has really gained some traction.  Unfortunately, and more than "semi-seriously," the Drifters/Sleepers, Anoikis, and all of the lore (which we're all still waiting to unfold) are an integral part of the story now.  Space is vast.  Wormhole space should not be removed.  New Eden was originally discovered and colonized by humankind *because* of a wormhole.  
---
What you're immersively experiencing is the growth of civilizations at war with:  one another; expansions across space and time, and through a new galactic cluster of systems; and a growing business model that necessitates change in order to generate interest.  That you're writing about the good old days means you yearn for when things were better for you and your friends.  I get that.  But if players are divided onto separate servers or exclusive Eve games altogether, the game will die.  It's equivalent to eliminating technological and medical breakthroughs of the present day because a few old-timers don't like having to use email.
---
And as for this sticks-and-stones BS:
---
&gt;The general degeneracy and ruin wormhole players have brought to the EvE game space, can be similarly be compared to the Twitch THOTs who ruin the livelihoods of men for their own personal amusement and gain. Their latest failure with complete black out of nullsec was the direct result of wormhole players asking for their gameplay to be extended nullsec. They can never be forgiven for this. Please kindly remind them that their thoughts and ideas belong in the darkness they so do enjoy. A simple BEGONE WHOT will do as arguing with wormhoers is ill advised.
---
Correct.  Arguing is ill-advised.  Salt only improves the flavor of your bald bulbous egg.  We strongly advise you stay docked until Local is empty and we return to Anoikis looking for more interesting company.

If a doctor wants to see if youre allergic to bananas they will test you for that and not if you are allergic to apples. Why is that? Because one of those tests will be relevant.
---
Now does Eve need substantial changes? Perhaps. Can you test peoples will to adapt to substantial changes by making a meme into reality? Not really no. 
---
The issue I see here is that a little group of people keep whiteknighting CCP for doing low effort-high impact changes. Thats your group mate. You are rewarding bad behaviour. Its like giving your child the thumbs up if you see them smoking. 
---
The rest of us saw what was actually happening. That CCP wanted to invest even less money into the game but still wanted to make big changes. We said no. We will not accept anything less than actual development. And the game will certainly not get better by turning of a switch.
---
This is what happened. Now you can try to make us into the bad guys for trying to save the game or you can accept that without us the game would have died within months. Its your choice. 
---
And fyi, we have been screaming for substantial change for quite some time. But it needs actual work and not some spare dev they can find between other failed projects they keep investing our money in.
---
Awesome!

Yes, splitting an already small and niche playerbase is a good idea.

This will be my 4th Eve Vegas. The conference areas shouldn't be an issue at all. That said, a lot of the general hanging out happens in bar areas where you are supposed to be 21+ to even enter. On the other hand, in my experience they usually won't card unless you give them a reason to ask, but if they do expect to be asked to leave.

Holy shit, has the "Created By:" always been there? I miss seeing stuff like that from games like Star Wars Galaxies. Pretty neat.

I get theres an argument for classic eve but you are being too retarded to make the vaild points. First paragraph is legitimate, i disagree but thats politics. What drugs did you take before writing the second paragraph?

Hey,
---
can someone tell me what happens, if there is a contract outstanding and the citadel he is on, is destroid? (WH-Space so no asset safety i assume)
---
I feel like the "over time" bit would be really hard to sell to the devs, but for ships (and even mods?) that would be really neat. I've fantasized a few times about trying to become the premier producer of xyz obscure hull of the moment.
---
You also have the line of attack BCs that don't have any counterparts. Much easier to slot them in there where there is less competition.
---
Any hole is the proper hole. The superior ghost sites that contain them spawn in any class of wormhole space. The one i got mine from was in a C4.

---
&gt; If a doctor wants to see if youre allergic to bananas they will test you for that and not if you are allergic to apples.
---
Actually that´s exactly what the doctor doesn´t do. He will test for general inflammatory factors in blood samples and perform broadband screens like the prick test.
---
&gt; Can you test peoples will to adapt to substantial changes by making a meme into reality?
---
Yes. Especially if the general direction of development would ultimately impact the same group of players in comparable ways. 
---
&gt; The issue I see here is that a little group of people keep whiteknighting CCP for doing low effort-high impact changes. Thats your group mate. You are rewarding bad behaviour. Its like giving your child the thumbs up if you see them smoking.
---
I never whiteknighted for CCP. They´re a bunch of amateurs and their handling of the situation was incompetent at best. As usual. Doesn´t mean just because the patient is dead you didn´t gain valuable data. It´s also why people need to take responsibility if they want the game to persist for relevant amounts of time since CCP has proven time after time again that they´re not able to do so by themselves. 
---
&gt; We will not accept anything less than actual development
---
You won´t get that. That has been near certain before blackout and it´s set in stone now. 
---
&gt; Now you can try to make us into the bad guys for trying to save the game or you can accept that without us the game would have died within months.
---
I never said it wouldn´t.  
---
 &gt; But it needs actual work and not some spare dev they can find between other failed projects they keep investing our money in.
---
Sure, but that was something CCP was conservative about even at the height of the game. It certainly isn´t an option now.
---
Not sure I should cop to exactly what I used to be in game out in the open...
---
Totally! Hope to see you in fleet in the near future.

In null you have the anoms that don't get the NPC miners. We don't regularly get the anoms that can be mined. Once in a while we'll get a relic or data site that can be mined but not often do they have Jaspet.

Yes! - But.

Not 3-4 months ago, they started talking about it again. Even presenting it as an almost released thing.

It is a melancholy time for EvE. I think you are probably right... I always said I'd play until the servers shut down, and I still intend to. My account may also go into maintenance mode (α) from time to time and my logins less frequent, but I'll be around. The one hope I have is that the history of this game is second to none, and that has value as IP. Maybe there will be an overhaul of the entire engine at some point and they will try to let you keep some version of your "stuff" in the next game to carry that history forward in some form. It may just be that they entirely focus their efforts on superficial mobile games though. 
---
I think the Trigs have made for some interesting content though. We'll see what happens. EvE has been "dying" since I started playing though. Citadels were an excellent addition, and I think if they just make certain resources unique to certain low and null sec regions and let all of them drop the loot, people might be inclined to actually fight for space again. That could bring some life to the game. We'll see though.
---
&gt; So they were heavily hinting a rebalance very soon, and then completely forgot about it.
---
Maybe we should check what Devs have left in that timespan lol

Get into covops ships. Pick a race and get frigate V, covert ops to at least 4, 5 when you can. The exploration frigs at lvl4 covops outscans astero though they have no offense. 
---
Exploration is a cheap, high pay pve activity that will also increase your awareness of wormholes. Wormholes lead to other players and more relic/data sites. Hisec sites suck, WH/NULL is where you wanna go. Sansha are known to be the highest paying dues to intact armour plates. GL, cya out there.

I crashed EVE Vegas in 2012 and it's a bunch of nerds being nerds, and a ton of alcohol.  Not something I would take my kid to, if they even let anyone under 18 in (probably not).

I don't know how it is now, but when it was in the conference center at Paris Las Vegas, we waited until like an hour after the

party started and just walked in.  Eventually Fozzie walked over and asket to see my ticket and I left in a hurry.
---
E:[From their Site](https://vegas.eveonline.com/)
---
Is there minimum age for EVE Vegas?
---
&gt;No. But minimum age for the EVE Vegas Party is 21 years (strict), and you need to bring your identification with proof of age to enter. Same restrictions apply for the Pub Crawl.
---
Usually player killers are much less toxic than npc-only killers ...
---
Thanks - it's a fun project! So far EVE has provided the greatest variety of different systems of governance and unofficial rules. I'd like to see what happens if the devs add more features in which are non-combat related - what kinds of incredible state-like organisations could form?
---
get wrecked op
---
An NPC corp?
---
Maybe because (at least until some years ago) these things were an advertised part of EVE and the players joined exactly for that.
---
Also I find it hilarious that you list pvp with scamming and betrayal. EvE is explicitly a PvP-MMO, where even the PvE can be PvP, even more so since Farms&amp;Fields patches
---
afaik it's impossible to impose this on ship hulls and modules because you can repackage them and stack, unlike abyssal mods - or so I understand it. Every mod has its own ID of sorts, unlike repackaged items.

Maybe it's a newbie bias thing but I`m really digging it. The guy who blew me up yesterday just sent a mail to ask if I wanted to join his corp while giving me free stuff lol.

Enthusiasm upvoted, a nice change of pace from all the typical ‘Eve is dying’ know-it-all cynicism crap.   Don’t let anyone curb yours.
---
KILL THEM  then you have problem gone ffs
---
Nothing against horde, but its a very specific playstyle out in a gigantic nullbloc. Lots of opportunity but you have to find your fun, and you often feel like a faceless cog. If, after you fly with Horde for awhile, you find it doesnt work for you, try a smaller, more personal corporation. Nulllblocs arent the only way to play the game, they just have the best marketing.
---
You take that back or I'll cut ye
---
then kill their DST's and loot the bitches that what im doing in lowsec
---
Sounds like someone who's never been. I haven't known anyone who didn't love it.
---
Pepperidge Farms remembers.
---
tested. standing loss is 0,0001%
---
It would be nice to have a securities market. Corporations also have “shares,” which is a feature that’s woefully underdeveloped. It would be cool to be able to buy shares in a corp like a regular market.
---
But the cool thing about Eve is its sandbox quality. I think the reason all these amazing organizational facets were able to form is because early on, the devs didn’t have a guiding hand beyond making sure things stay balanced. There’s an interview with CEO Hilmar talking about that very fact; I think it’s one of the Mittani videos, where he says Eve was designed with a hands-off approach so that dictatorships and warlords could actually be a thing. 
---
Any new features should be like a door, crafted to give players more options and to be more innovative. 
---
And what we’ve seen recently with CCP’s “Era of Chaos” shows that when the devs pave over the sandbox, the game struggles. EVERYTHING in Eve is PVP, markets, politics. We play to fight other people, not the game devs.
---
0,0001% actually
---
standing hit is micro size.  you would have to kill approx 150 fleets of miners to have any impacting standing loss
---
At least I’m not damaged enough to believe impartial judgement isn’t a virtue
---
The Ashimmu pilot were eager to neutralize the enemy.
---
Due to how their database works, when a ship gets repackaged it erases all the info on it. Thats why killmarks disappear when you repackage.
---
B.s. I have a wonderful son that I devote my every breath and whole existence to. I still have time to enjoy eve and he even likes to watch sometimes though is not much into video games. 
---
Just Ccp stop making it such a miserable game to enjoy with half baked totally cocked ideas
---
Battleship meta lives in the fact that it's cool to fly a battleship. And that's about it...

Turn on your afterburner when you are fighting, it makes you harder to hit.

Also, look into getting a good overview package that will make your overview waaaay better.

Every weapon type has a long range, lower dps version, and a short range higher dps version. Heavy missiles are the long range, heavy assaults are the short range. Generally heavy assaults (HAM's for short) are very, very good.

I was heavy into eve, 2 kids a wife and 10 hour days at work ended my leisure time, I cant wait for echoes to release, it was great for casual play between feeding the kids and walking the dog.
---
I fail to see how this is a bad idea. 
---
1. Players could be play both Classic and Modern. Most of null is ping warriors anyway.
---
2. Having a second server feeds to players that want to play an older version of EvE Online.

Mimesis also provide penalties
---
I know that it's so little that after killing a dozen of them i can still run lv4 missions with astral mining.
---
I guess Kitfox s been more adressing the boredom of having FCs who precalculate the outcome of every battle and just do not undock the fleet if there is the slightest chance they might lose. And I m all with Kitty there. That sucks in a game.
---
It already exists... Interdiction Maneuvers charge in skirmish bursts.
---
What strikes you are particular invalid?
---
You can do a passive rattle for under a bil that’ll smoke C3 sites and even run C4s but you don’t want to do those (horrible spawns and longer clear times coupled with constant refits to min/max). Easy 150m/hour so you’ll make the cost of the fit back quickly. I can find and link the fit if interested (on mobile or I’d post now). 
---
If you find 2 good C3s in a day and aren’t interrupted/ know what you’re doing, you can easily pay for your ship and pay your sub for the month. Now - that’s if you aren’t interrupted. WH activity is admittedly at a bit of a low point right now but that’s not to say that it’s non-existent (as it sounds like you already know). 
---
You’ll be at almost infinitely greater risk running only 1 toon in a C3 than you would running a solo Ishtar as part of a big null block where you simply have to watch local/intel and be perfectly safe. My alliance is one of several that fairly routinely rolls into or finds ratters down the chain and kills them for sometimes billions lost. Day trippers are especially vulnerable because you have no tether, no POS, and likely don’t have nearly the amount of intel that an established C5 Corp does that has come to gank you with every dps also having a sabre alt and a maxed combat scanner to probe you as soon as you land on a safe. Just things to consider. 
---
As for the other ships, Loki&gt;Tengu. Loki applies and projects better and tanks slightly worse but this doesn’t matter much for C3 sites. You’ll spend easily over 1b for the fit and clear time is slower than a rattle. I personally think they’re more vulnerable than a rattle due to the lack of MJD, and a rattle can put up a bit of a fight whereas the T3C will just eat shit as soon as it’s point/web or a neut even looks at it.
---
Hello powercreep my old friend...
---
Solo or with help? What fitting you flying?
---
bling hac tanking them very good preferably shield ones. rely on resists+passive regen,without faction/deadspace mods you can  do them but  you will run hot.
---
At least it's not a Call of Duty convention. It's pretty much the opposite there.
---
Where do you suggest newer players get eve related discussion with fewer primitive preservatives?
---
true.  so....so...true.
---
a bunch of kids walking around with sterio systems screaming all the cuss words they can think of
---
So much this, its way easier for me to buy 20-40$ of plex each months and don't farm at all. It take me 2 hours to ''farm'' 1100 plex . #worth. More pewing  - Less farming.
---
Lemme AFK mine and do some curls right quick
---
I forsee a decrease in players. You can't really say otherwise.
---
See that corp application page I linked?
---
The corp's public chat channels are quite helpful for new players. Most corp members don't pay much attention to the public channels, mainly just the recruiters (who are also channel mods), but it's a good place to ask questions.
---
It's already in the mail
---
Deep time space pockets or as the lore says
---
Scope news in captains quarters was so neat.
---
What complex is this guy from?
---
They came from the Abyss
---
And as of where the heck is the Abyss, nobody except for some lore nerd in CCP knows, at least for now
---
That's not a set though.
---
hello fun police my old friend...
---
Yeah but you’d have spent as much on eve as retirement.
---
&gt; and other adult activities
---
lmao I have heard some shit about EVE Vegas that's for sure
---
I doubt it’ll cover the interest on his student debt...
---
&gt;  new stuff coming
---
:thinking:
---
&gt; Yet 20 bombers can delete an entire battleship fleet.
---
Only unprepared battleship fleets. It's extremely easy to counter bombers if you have half a brain. There are even weapon systems specifically designed for this purpose which, when actually used, render bombs useless. 
---
Source: I have deleted entire battleship fleets with bombs. Regularly, for years.
---
There is a lot of drinking from what I can tell, so I'm just going for the talks and maybe meet some people. I dont drink at all.
---
Oh thank you very much!
---
Whenever I convince a friend to try EVE I always send them this video first. Best trailer I have ever seen for ANY game.
---
No.
---
😂
---
So let me get this straight... you decided to pod them right there and then regardless of what you’re doing or what you’re flying?
---
I smell bullshit Susan
---
That might actually be a good thing for Eve. It would at least even out the sides bit.
---
The actual conference is pretty mild though. It's the evening events that are 21+. 
---
If your son likes Eve, they he will probably enjoy the conference.
---
Income - expenses x time = wealth   
---
As long as your income is greater than expenses you start accumulating wealth and it starts to snowball. I would say right around the 1 year mark of playing is when most people start snowballing and being able to toss around ISK. People who have been playing the game for a decade have had a long time to snowball their wealth and so they have hundreds of billions of ISK to throw around.
---
Agreed, although actually after tax, national insurance (british), and pension deductions my fairly reasonable salary works out an equivelent of 2bil isk an hour based on the 15400 plex pack (I know isk sellers offer a better rate)  with current $&gt;£ exchange rates. Which means that actually if you earn the national average wage (which I believe is around £24k at the moment) you just be earning the equivalent of 1bil an hour, so quite a few people in this thread are making more than that... shame its just space rich eh ;)
---
poor guy
---
you can also do this with a t3 dessi but it's more cheese than fighting
---
This.  I don't expect much right now with Vegas so close but if Vegas is a flop in terms of what is coming then I fear for the worst.
---
I've been to the last 4 Eve Vegas events. You should 100% do this. It really changes the conference for the better.
---
/u/PM_ME_DUCKS below recommended Brave. I was in Brave before I joined Goons 5 years ago. I recommend you take DUCKS up on their suggestion.
---
Yup, that's why all the game packs are on sale now. Too many new players, gotta cut that number down. Oh wait.
---
I'd also suggest e-uni. Start there, learn the game a bit more then you can decide whether you want to live in highsec, low, null or wherever.
---
It was a response to your comment of becoming a risk averse krab. I don't krab, but I do enjoy pvp in many forms and from my point of view there are sure a lot of risk averse pvpers that try to get away when they see what was supposed to be a gank has done a 180 before their eyes.
---
Rarely do I encounter other pvpers who want to fight to the death. Pretty risk averse, when I'm flying something expensive im equally guilty of it
---
stupid idea, stop suggesting it
---
Maybe that's why all the decisions being made are half baked.
---
Can close your eyes and listen to it like a podcast if you prefer, it's not like that one episode of Black Mirror
---
Small nitpick, but a vindicator is probably the easiest way to join an incursion group, it takes over a month just to sit in a logi cruiser compared to a couple days for a vindicator.
---
I was answering to his question about "how do you make so much isk?", and grinding all day to make isk as an objective in itself and being averse to risk (and thus losses) is clearly an easy way to do that.
---
If you felt so butthurt about my use of the phrase "risk averse krab" (which you clearly did considering your answer) that's entirely on you buddy, not my fault, I wasn't even pointing fingers.
---
I've got a friend who has a really great printer he uses to make custom dnd figures each new campaign or death lol. He is printing me the three SoE ships this week
---
If you have a nvidia card you can use shadowplay
---
Wouldn’t you need racial battleships V to use it well, though?
---
No shit. It wasnt a simplification? Point being you dont test and treat for irrelevant shit.
---
No you cant, because you cannot compare no local to anything else. Go ahead and give me an example of what this magical other thing would be.
---
So what is the issue then? You are yourself admitting the situation was bad. Which is what we were saying. But your idea of responsibility is that we should accept being victims without counters. That the majority should not have fun so the minority does and if we dont it means we want the game to die.
---
Incarna was much like this mate. And after the outcry CCP delivered what most agree is one of the best expansions. And if it was like that before then age of chaos wouldnt changed shit because the blackout wasnt actual development. So if they are gonna let the game die then atleast it can die while the majority can have fun.
---
Then the game is doomed no matter what. But it sure as shit has nothing to do with the blackout and everything to do with CCP dropping the ball. The only thing I see the blackout has actually done is to highlight that this game is on the brink of death and needs actual work to survive long term. 
---
Now we as players can either unite in our demands or we can bicker about the blackout. I prefer the former approach because it puts pressure on CCP to actually start doing some work. That atleast gives us a fighting chance. Im not saying it will change anything but if this game is truly to die then atleast it wasnt on us. 
---
But if we sit here and point fingers... I mean you get the rest. It should have never become a PvP vs. PvE or small gang vs big gang thing. If everyone would have just thought about the changes for more than 2 minutes they would have realised they were bad and we would have been the entire playerbase against CCP. Then we would have perhaps gotten a delayed local or something like it.
---
Sometimes you'll just get a private message. Yeah doesn't happen super often, but it has happened.
---
Just search in game for "Pandemic Horde Inc.", apply, check back for an invitation, accept it, and you'll find all the details you need.
---
I've been playing for a few weeks now, joined them after I finished the tutorial, and to the other comment, I think smaller null corps aren't suited for beginners, being in such a huge alliance allows me to navigate around nullsec relatively safely and the home station market is always full of stock.
---
&gt; if they use wormholes do we get chance to invade their space?
---
You get to invade their space for a short time whenever you use an abyssal filament. 
---
They come from abyssal space.
---
Abyssal Deadspace is an area of deep subspace that seems to have semi/stable pockets among massive gravity fluxuations. 
---
Whether the Trig discovered or in fact made it is unclear. We know that at one point they came from k space and was most likely part of the second Jove Empire.
---
Almost every bit of your maths (and assumptions) is/are wrong, but that's beside the point when you consider for example the working poor for which even as little as $1000 USD  extra per month would go a very long way. I mean I know people that have a pretty decent salary but still feel the need to run bitcoin farms at home, and they, I'm pretty sure, make quite a bit less with their machines than someone botting in eve.
---
All of these ships are very expensive. If you want to do anomaly ratting, use an ishtar. If you want to do DED complex ratting, I'd use either tengu or rattlesnake. From what I've heard and seen, loki is more often used for pvp and tengu for pve. Also, loki uses neither drones nor missiles, which you have already started skilling into
---
It will be tough to play rp in a universe with varieties freaks 😂 Good luck and fly safe.
---
This is nauseous, as in this is causing nausea. Not that this makes others feel like causing nausea.
---
Where do you see Pearl Abyss in all of this? Any chance of them being able to actually turn things around?
---
Ye its amulets now on TQ even. So it has gone forward.
---
&gt;minttits
---
Ok, I have to admit that made me laugh.
---
That's the best part about EVE; we understand that to make sure we have good fights, we have to make sure that both sides are in good spirits after the fact.  If you just outright kill the enjoyment of the other side, you're just going to get to a point where you're standing atop the hill with nobody to push into you.
---
Kind of what's going on in nullsec right now; nobody wants to fight Citadels, and proliferation of them is too easy, so instead of fighting they just crab.
---
Surprisingly little gambling from what I see of attendees. 
---
Also the prostitutes in vegas are legalized but kept off-strip, you can just expect to get a lot of cards handed to you while walking the strip if you're a dude.
---
Otherwise yep the rest is accurate.
---
I’ll check you out if I remember o7 good luck out there
---
I had a trio of t2 frigs (maybe a cruiser or something too) roll up me one of the first times I was in lowsec (sent for a mission) and I'm dead in like 30s or so. Then podded too, thanks fuckers. Then I get a msg from one of them "we need to destroy the station too?" Huh? "For your mission." Oh.. "we gonna destroy it anyway." ... "Your mission is done." 
---
So a least I didn't lose standing.
---
Love you too, spodbrain.
---
It's Vegas - I think it's assumed there will be *some* misbehaving.  She'll be on her own too outside of the conference hours.  (!!)
---
Just half of the brain 😂
---

---
The gambling and the hookers I took a stab at because I’ve not been there but gambling in Las Vegas, that’s not going to be a big surprise to anyone.
---
The hookers were a sniff of imagination of something that conceivably be present [again, never been, couldn’t say].
---
It’s going to be good. EVE Vegas has gotten its own reputation and public, it’s going to be awesome.
---
That's great for in game, and I expected that, but I Reddit when I'm not at home playing.

---
I, too, want to know where he can go AFK rat in a juicy, hopefully bling, rattlesnake...
---
Yes, but re-balancing is a constant process.
---
If you always wait for rebalances to fix current issues, you'll never add anything new.
---
Tho the Trigs could use a nerf.
---
Wow classic has had a very corrosive effect on the wow community. It did much more than just split the playerbase. Every social circle lost a few members. This more often than not collapses the social circle because they now must find new players to replace those that left. More often than not the circle collapses completely and most of the people in it quit as a result. 
---
The result is a kind of turbo attrition that's quickly strangled the life out of many guilds on retail wow. And still no assurance that classic will survive long term.
---
And you want this fate for eve online?
---
Why is it so easy for me to picture a room full of EVE players awkwardly staring and two people kissing
---
Whatever, r/eve has no sense of humor any more.
---

---
I'm going to guess that you were in there many years ago. Because thats quite unlike what things have been recently.
---
There was also a banana with a condom on it nearby. I kind of looked the other way on that one...

---
Grab a shield tank praxis and come wreck sleepers in c3 wormholes. Capstable fit is around 600mil but I got a 1k dps blitz fit that's not exactly cap stable. You can farm up to 150-200mil/h in c3s
---
Thought for a revamp of the missile mechanic... Right now the missile mechanic is somewhat challenging to intuitively predict how you'll apply damage due to the interactions of speed and sign against the missile attributes.  
---
I was thinking today about a way to bring missile mechanics more in line with guns, so that missiles can miss
---
Instead of explosion velocity and radius... Replace that with manuverability and terminal proximity radius.
---
It works (in my head) like this, you lock a target and fire. At t=0, a line is established between the agressor and target ship positions. Centered on this line is a cone (wide end toward target) who's angularity is defined by the missiles mobility.  
---
The as the missile moves down the cone it checks for terminal proximity (is it close enough to go boom), if not then it checks is the target still in the initial cone. If no, the missile loses target and misses. If yes, then it draws a new cone centered on a new line between the current missile position and the target, and reapeats until it either hits, misses, or runs out of fuel.
---
Or alternatively, I guess just use the current gun mechanics to determine hit or miss instantly and then just let the damage be delayed by flight time?
---
lol my Corp did this way back in the day. We shit on people in wardecs then turned around and protected them from others, joined their alliance, or just taught them how to deal with other corps like ours.
---
fuckin lol it's muted cause of copyright
---
Insults and death threats? Who the fuck are you killing, man? Where I live, we send you thank-you messages via missiles.
---
But they don't say "someone get tackle"
---
Wait what is the right subreddit?
---
Just the first 6 minutes are muted. You pretty much only miss the introduction.
---
Its super easy to drive the spawns off.  Fire one shot at literally any of the npcs, and then *immediately* warp off before the response fleet lands.  The miners and hauler will warp to a safespot and sit there until they despawn.  The Hostile response fleet will land on grid where you were, then, if you warped off as you should have, they will find no target and warp on top of the miner NPCs and sit there. Your belt will be yours again.
---
Loki has missile sub. 
---
Also has a modest 40mbit drone bay with that sub.
---
Hell, 107 of them blapped my rorqual in mere seconds. Granted, I was unsieged, they caught me with my pants down and kicked me in the gonads.
---
How *dare* 107 players be able to kill me? The audacity! /s
---
They're only OP when you have 200 of them.

Put together a fleet of 200 Muninns with support, and tell me how the bombers do.

---
The friend ship should be a real ship that blues and adds whoever targets it to a fleet, with friendly fire disabled punishable by drifter battleships, who warp in and fuck up anyone who doesn't want to be your friend, be it in null, high sec, or a wormhole.
---
That is all.
---
where was FXR?

Yea, but how is that different from Winterco retreating right? I mean if they did advance, you'd have all of em down and nothing would happen

---
It looks like a C-level overview - to be wheeled out during board meetings etc.
---
UI Changes..  
---
EVEs UI is now mostly dropdown based. What if that was to change just a bit..   
---
Right now a difference between life and death is often how fast can you right click and select the right option from that dropdown. That doesnt seem right from the UX perspective. I feel like if there was a different solution then maybe new players would also like it and the retention would improve. I'm not a specialist and can't propose a good solution to this but there is definitely a lot of room for improvement.  
---
I bet there are people here that would give some examples of how the UI could be improved.. ;)
---
I want something new and exciting for EvE. Sorry you see it as something to lose, and not something to gain.
---
There's not much reason to throw away an old character. You already have skills trained and some assets, unless you really hate the character name it's easier to re subscribe with the old one.
---
Not currently. The alliance we formed under "Aggerssively Average" is the new version of TBC. Same concept, different name.
---
And does the RAF works that way?
---
I mean... They are very basic characters. I didn't play as much after the tutorial (and I need to do it anyway)
---
Was a nice fight.

I'd recommend [Brand Newbros](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Brand_Newbros) as a good place to start.

---
&gt; No shit. It wasnt a simplification?
---
Wut? You picked a dumb analogy to support your point. That´s all. 
---
&gt; No you cant, because you cannot compare no local to anything else
---
You can use it as factor to measure engagement of passive and non-proactive players. Many of the changes needed to turn the game around would inconvenience these players in one way or another and would force them to pursue more individualistic and less dependend playstyles. The blackout was a sufficient model to measure if those players would be willing to stick with the game if faced with this environment or if it would make them stop playing. The later was the case. 
---
&gt; But your idea of responsibility is that we should accept being victims without counters
---
My idea of responsibility is that you should at least have a moderate amount of self-dependency and incentive to be proative on a personal level to succesfully and profitably participate in non-hisec content generation, be it PvE or PvP. Because that is what keeps sandboxes diverse and afloat. Besides CCPs fuckups sandboxes are rarely balanced. It takes players willing to comit to non optimal playstyles to keep them going. I never argued that the blackout on it´s own would be a good way to do so in the long run. As i have stated multiple times. 
---
&gt; Incarna was much like this mate
---
It wasn´t like this at all for plenty of reasons. 
---
&gt; And after the outcry CCP delivered what most agree is one of the best expansions
---
Crucible wasn´t exactly an expansion. It was a balance pass on issues people were complaining about for years and it took all of CCPs development efforts for a year to accomplish. The CCP we deal with these days is a mere husk of the CCP back then and Eve hasn´t been a focus of development for at least 3-4 years now. On top of that Eve was a growing franchise which it won´t be ever again. They aren´t even the ones calling the actual shots anymore. Do you really think it was mere coincidence that they pulled this stunt right now and that it really was about Hilmars bonus? PA wanted some hard data on how to handle the game in the future and wether it was worth it to invest any effort and hard currency into changes that would potentially enable longer term stability at the risk of agitating a part of the playerbase. Or wether they were just going to milk what´s left of it. You just convinced them to do the later in the most obvious way that a table pusher is able to fathom. 
---
&gt; Then the game is doomed no matter what.
---
It is. 
---
&gt; The only thing I see the blackout has actually done is to highlight that this game is on the brink of death and needs actual work to survive long term.
---
It needed work for years and it was obvious that CCP wouldn´t deliver on that part. It´s on the playerbase to not at least trying to compensate for that well known and decade old fact. 
---
&gt; Now we as players can either unite in our demands or we can bicker about the blackout.
---
That would imply we, the players, would be in a position to bargain. We are way past that point. 
---
&gt;  It should have never become a PvP vs. PvE or small gang vs big gang thing
---
It was never about that. It was about active self reliant content creators blaming the people who aren´t that to be in part responsible for the current state of the game. Everything else is just ideoligical propaganda and gate keeping.
---
There is nothing to gain from this. And there would be nothing new from reviving old content either. It's by definition not new.
---
This will be my 6th EVE Vegas.
---
There is a good amount of simply chatting with others.  Typically your corp/alliance and other people you know in game. 
---
There are sessions that usually go 9-10 in the morning to 5 in the afternoon on a variety of topics.
---
There is a small "EVE Store" with things for sale and there will probably a room for the PvP action in the tournament.
---
Many (including myself) give away swag to people, usually with corp/alliance logos.  Find me and I'll hook you up.
---
Night is usually "partying" with food and drink.
---
How much SP do the old chars have?
---
what is this 3rd party mapping tool you are using? looks a bit weird.
---
never seen it before

I don't see anything in your profile that touts your doubling abilities, no wallet links and certainly no large bounty that is indicative of the many thanks you received from satisfied customers.

Pretty much all of them tbh

In an ideal world you'll eventually train it to V, but I don't think any incursion group requires that. I don't think TDF or WTM require T2 guns to start either, they just want you to train them once you've been flying with them for a while.

True, but to different degrees.

Yeah, that's kind of an inherent double-edged sword for the game. All that stuff is what makes it unique and part of the game's appeal, but they also make it hard to tell precisely *when* someone has crossed the line separating acceptable gameplay and toxic behavior.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ What can be done? I don't know. I just play the game and muddle through as best I can.

---
Yes, and in the post-blackout reality any investor that has braincells left won't touch this game with even the longest of sticks. You can't win with this community at the moment because noone is actually willing to compromise.  
---
Would you put money in a game, where if you fuck up one change 1/3 of the player base leaves outright at the mere prospect of that change? I know i wouldn't invest in that pile of shit.  
---
So yes voting with your wallet is important, but what happened here was just a show of force how degraded this games community is at this point.

The first time I died, it was to a gatecamp in lowsec. Less than a minute after my pod escaped, I got an EvE-Mail and ten million ISK from one of the guys who killed me. I was floored, that was more money than I'd ever had before and I couldn't fathom why he had done that.
---
Turns out that he could tell I was new and sent me that ISK so I wouldn't quit the game. I wasn't intending to, but I was touched by his action and thanked him for it. We had a short chat and went our separate ways, but that's something that will stick with me for as long as I play.

Yea i was slightly off-topic here, and i also understand that not everybody has the time available to create content for themselves.  
---
But the sooner this collective community realises that the more people undock on their own, the more fun everybody will have, the quicker we will have a healthier game.  
---
If those same FCs can't get fleet members because there are more attractive alternatives to their fleet, they will immediately take more risky engagments.
---
Everyone got shitcanned
---
Check out Brave Empire. A new high-sec corp related to Brave Newbies. It's a great place to learn the ropes and get into the more social aspect of Eve Online. 
---
In short. There's a good number of corps that are new player friendly.  It all depends what your ambitions are. Brave Empire specializes in teaching the game in high-sec where you are less likely to be blown up over and over again. We are a small sub-group but growing more and more each day!
---
Either way, look forward to seeing you in space! Fly Safe 7o.
---
I remember back in the day when you could single cycle them! They nerfed them hard wow
---
I met manifest at E3 Years back, really cool dude.
---
Or when it's in pickles. Baby dill pickles have about a year's worth of the human body's salt requirements in them and they're tasty as hell.
---
Just do 10/10 farming in a rattle.
---
Kill them. The hauler can drop like 150mil.
---
What part of "for 60 seconds" did you have difficulty understanding
---
I have no clue what that is. I gave my example based on my knowledge of scape when I played it, which was 2003 to 2009 and then for a year after 07scape came out
---
In game map, I think.   I was looking at cynos and jumps on it the other day.
---
Death threats? *Seriously?* I get cranky when someone blows up my ship, but that feeling lasts ~10 minutes at most and then I go back to playing the game.
---
Christ, internet spaceships may be serious business but there's a point where you're taking things *too* seriously.
---
What ever happened to mintchip
---
&gt; If you just outright kill the enjoyment of the other side, you're just going to get to a point where you're standing atop the hill with nobody to push into you.
---
Or they just stop playing the game entirely, and I don't think anyone who actually loves EvE wants that. We need more people!
---

Usually after a battle while we are all flying home in our broken ships and pods everyone's like "great fight see ya next time!" In local haha
---
Disgusting
---
Not sure if it's true, but word of mouse told me that some asshole began cyberstalking her after she accidentally posted naked pics to one of her social media accounts. IIRC they were up for like, ten seconds at most, but that was enough time for the creep to download them and start the harassment campaign.
---
Especially to people like myself who have borderline OCD when it comes to spelling and grammar. I get anxiety issues if my writing doesn't look correct even if there are no glaring issues with it that I can discern.
---
hi.
---
nice to meet you bud...
---
I wont say much, as im too shy \*wink wink\* to be talkative, but i think as for begining you would fit my corpo quite well...
---
We have some ppl that are experienced as hell, knowing a lot of mechanics and using it well.
---
We got a lot of ppl like you, who starts playing it again or even first time, so you wouldn't be alone...
---
We try a lot of activities - from mining and exploring through invasions and incursions (pve) ending up with roaming fleets and covert cyno drops (pvp).
---
So whatever you would like to try ingame once you play - we can help you with that...
---
We are community more than ingame corp, so anytime you want to take a brake from the game - its completly fine... If you have some other games on steam we can also try to go that direction as well...
---
So, lets sum it up. 
---
If you dont look for veteran corp and search for something newbie friendly, with lots of activities to show, who can try to show you ropes of getting a bigger fish in the game, my corp should do the job. You can also leave anytime, we dont mind it... It might be a good startup for further development ;)
---
Oh. And since we are more of community than corpo, we gather ppl from all across the globe. We got a lot of US folks, but im from EU, we got plenty more guys from EU and Australia, so there is mostly always someone online.
---
If you are interested in this offer, just hit me up with reply here, ill try my best to comfort you :bigthink:

There are a lot of active bombers these days because there are a lot more active capitals, and bombers are designed to be, in part, a hard counter to capital spam.
---
And I like fighting end game Eve in frigates. It's more fun than fighting it in supers and titans.
---
Nah, Frat is "Mr Roboto"
---
If I may advise, before you jump back into a big group, fly with a smaller corporation for awhile. Tons of fun to be had with a small group of buddies and it's easier to relearn the game.     
---
Nothing against the big guys. Just think it's better to start out small.
---
Damn people playing the game somewhere grrrr i’m looking and seeing them playing &gt;: (. Something has to be done about this how could they possibly allow this?!  People are PLAYING the game!!!! FUCK THIS FUCK CCP WHY CCP HOW COULD YOU ALLOW THIS SAFETY TO OCCUR I WANT DANGER FOR THEM GRRR HOW DARE THEY PLAY IN

I WANT TO KILL THEM BUT THEY DONT LET ME FUCKING OP SAFETY BOTS HACKS CCP PLEASE OH MY GOD IM GOING TO DIE GAME WILL BE DEAD IF YOU DONT STOP THEM FUCK PEOPLE PLAYING THE GAME REEEEEEEE 
---
ITS A PVP GAME THAT MEANS PVE IS ILLEGAL FFS BAN THEM
---
Its eve players mostly getting along, but like previously said before, nerds doing nerd things. Every time i go i have a great time and meet some great people. It's a lot of talking/listening and power points but if you guys are really into eve, lore, and player experiences, it'll be fun.
---
I mean. I am a member of a Fraternity ally but, you are not wrong.
---
Easily one of the all time best propaganda videos.
---
But this is a *sandbox* I SHOULDNT HAVE TO FIGHT THINGS??!??
---
Look how bright lowsec is, something needs to be done.
---
That’s some pretty DED site loot. Remember Eve is a game of PvP at all times. There are people who dream at night of new ways to wreak havoc on other people - it’s actually encouraged gameplay. Haul less in a more tanker vehicle OR contract it via courier to make the risk virtually zero. For real though, courier contracts.
---
They did a good job at what they set out to do. As much as you don’t wanna hear it, you fucked up. One T1 destroyer worth 4 million tops could have claimed it the second you fell out of warp. 
---
Don’t leave the game. Use this experience as the springboard to learn more than DED sites. You’ve got this, man. I was in the same spot as you once and turned it completely around.
---
Speaking of which, we should all just go back to Star Wars Galaxies. Much better potential.

The Revenant needs more spikes and Sansha needs more ship hulls. I'd settle for not being able to use them right off the bat so long as they looked good, and have found some on Deviantart that would probably fit the bill (some were even for the Design-A-Ship contest!):
---
* [*Spectre* battlecruiser](https://www.deviantart.com/krats/art/Sansha-s-Spectre-182232741) - more vertical ships is always good.
---
* [*Hellhound* battlecruiser](https://www.deviantart.com/lperegrine/art/Sansha-s-Hellhound-182608966) - looks like the Sansha equivalent of a [*Warlock*-class destroyer](https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Warlock_class_destroyer) from Babylon 5.
---
* [*Revenant* battlecruiser](https://www.deviantart.com/morality-gradient/art/Revenant-Battlecruiser-182610721) - the artist made this before *Incursion* launched, so the name is entirely coincedental.
---
* [*Banshee* battlecruiser](https://www.deviantart.com/briandoyle81/art/Sansha-s-Nation-Banshee-182375278) - another battlecruiser, this time it's wide instead of tall.
---
* [*Spectre* battlecruiser](https://www.deviantart.com/novafox/art/Sansha-BC-Specter-Sketch-156802298) #2 - nis the same as the one above, but it's a different ship.
---
* [*Ignus* battlecruiser](https://www.deviantart.com/novafox/art/Sansha-Nation-Ignus-121011938) - I found a *lot* of battlecruisers, and this one is also vertical! (Though you might not be able to tell due to how fat the main hull is)
---
* [Unnamed battlecruiser](https://www.deviantart.com/rotosequence/art/Sansha-s-Nation-Battlecruiser-182565011) - this one is both tall and unique-looking, I like it!
---
* [*Siren* cruiser](https://www.deviantart.com/izumizagari/art/Siren-182253306) - Sansha's Nautilus!
---
* [*Incubus* destroyer](https://www.deviantart.com/novafox/art/Sansha-Nation-Incubus-120908368) - the only destroyer I could find, though I'm not sure it looks good enough to base anything on.
---
* [*Echidna* frigate](https://www.deviantart.com/bi99uns/art/Echidna-Eve-Online-Constest-182471920) - weird-looking, but enough spikes to fit and the shape has possible Jove influence to it.
---
[*Abhorrence* mothership/carrier](https://www.deviantart.com/novafox/art/Sansha-Mothership-Aborrence-135324819) ([color WIP](https://www.deviantart.com/novafox/art/Abhorrence-WIP1-135395957)) - Drawn before the Revenant was released, I think it might fit as a carrier or some other capital ship if CCP ever fixes their proliferation issues.
---
[*Repugnance* fighter](https://www.deviantart.com/novafox/art/Sansha-Fighter-Repugnance-135323891) - Again, drawn before the Shadow was released, but it might actually work as a Sansha-designed fighter or drone.
---
&gt; It will be tough to play rp in a universe with different kinds of freaks
---
Not sure how many people there are there doing it, but there's role players at the structure at the EVE Gate. I think they role play like Sisters of EVE scientists or something studying the EVE Gate.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzvjG13w9hA] More like this tbh.

How much!? :D
---
We don't need an anthem when we have a war horn.
---
୧༼ಠ益ಠ༽୨ SOUND THE HORDE HORN ୧༼ಠ益ಠ༽୨
---
Yes my man. Sound it! We shall fight till the end! The Horde will stand!
---
~doot do doooo~
---
Thought you said Garbage sale.
---
Sounds kinky.
---
What else do you do?
---
Maybe your joke was just bad
---
depends who is that thing,or what.
---
Poor soul
---
Love that approach... Just returned after a time off and went some area I have no clue about, no "firm allies" in and am just enjoying whizzing through with small ships, sneaking through with big ships, watch the locals and try figuring out whats happening around me :D
---
If we all d stick to follow likely predictions we could just drop the game and declare someone winner. The fun part in games is the surprise, the unexpected turning of events, the dramatic upheaval( eventually successful, eventually not).
---
Dare doing stuff, Capsuleers! You cant die anyways!
---
It's great, if you want to drop caps, you have to have more strategy to it. If someone sees a Rapier/Arazu/Pilgrim/Falcon on grid, you can kind of expect it, etc.
---
Yes they made moving capitals more difficult, but subcap content is fire yo.
---
Can confirm
---
"Impartial Judgement" . . . yeah no, you sound like a broken record, you don't even play any more and you're sitting here giving yourself heart issues over wanting to take pleasure in people losing their livelyhoods because years ago some of the people there didn't listen to you?  
---
Seek help.
---
&gt; My nightmare is that CCP are not willing to invest to make Eve a better, and more, say, up to date game.
---
CCP probably isn't, given the fact they sold the game to the Koreans.
---
Lol who knew one fax breaks HORDE
---
Yes, End topic.
---
&gt; If someone sees a Rapier/Arazu/Pilgrim/Falcon on grid, you can kind of expect it
---
Well that's if the pilot isn't a turbo pepega.
---
You know it doesn’t. Dropping it into a system where caps aren’t allowed to be dropped, though, changes things. According to the FC he was told a gf was coming but no mention that a fax would be included. He would have gotten a bigger fleet. 
---
They were trying for a good and even fight to get content. That’s not what it ended up being.
---
Yes, please. It would be so nice to see your fit :)
---
last I heard horde didnt sound the horn for 2 regions getting invaded. is it just rusty or...
---
Pornhub and EVE streaming.
---
Would you mind sharing ur fit please?
---
refer a friend.
---
Which 2 regions?
---
Depends on how old the character is and how long it trained.  If it was like a 2 week trial the guy never did anything with a new character would likely start with more sp now.
---
I've found EvE to be like kosher salt. 
---
The cleanest kind of sassy with some helpful advice that usually follows a dumb kill. 
---
Wish I could find a couple of the guys that I cussed out as a brand new player for killing me but now I understand the concept of nonconsensual pvp.
---
Welcome back to New Eden. o7
---
Its only bad for the carebears... who cares about carebears, they do nothing of value, the real pvp elite would pvp in ibis if they would have to... noone needs carebears except ccp and the rmters of nullsec, which are mostly ALL OF THEM
---
Listen to this guy,
---
My answer is very similar to this.  Some things I build, some things I have shipped from place to place.  Other things I buy and hold when I get a good feeling about its future.   I update orders and set up contracts over my morning coffee and print isk quite nicely in my sleep.  An analytical mind, some ESI pulls, and some good logic in a few spreadsheets makes for some bonkers ticks.
---
But remember, gravy trains are almost always temporary.  Move with the market and keep your mouth shut about what you do.
---
that might be true. but the guy mentioned in the article didnt.
---
Good Bot
---
I am concerned for your mental health r/eve is mostly full of salty vets and people who haven't played in years / ever. There are  people that currently play. But more then not there playing the game and you know having fun. But to each there own on that front.

Are you in Goons or Panfam?

No, but I hope one day r/Eve goes a day without a post like yours.
---
In the last year I've been playing again there has been a lot of new stuff, world events are unfolding ATM, I like what the game is and I play, and I pay for my sub about every other month when ISK is getting low.

Proteus is good how exactly?

Years ago, if I’m not mistaken, smartbombing some structures or beacons in high sec, depending on the mission, could get you concordokken. Or so I heard been ages since I PVE’d in high sec, and never tried it myself due to that very rumour. Is that a thing?

Oh my sweet summer child... keep thinking that you'll take longer to hate the game.

Be careful not to crack your egg while visiting /r/egg_irl or do idc.
---
  What does money even matters when Eve already got your soul?
---
no
---
So basically you think that people should stick around playing a game they don’t like anymore?  Eve has been bleeding folk for a long time. “Social circles” have been dying in eve because people don’t like the direction ccp has gone and have up and left. Classic eve might kill retail eve, but it’s not healthy anyways. At least classic eve might stand a chance of bringing folk who have long gone back into the game.
---
The Empires are carebears as well, hence why they turbo mine belts to be able to maintain their infrastructure as well as build all those corvettes and then give them to cunts like you for free.
---
That's my point it's broken in the opposite way lol fucking usless
---
This took longer to make than their list of "chaos" changes
---
Sansha BC would be overpowered AF with a 100mn afterburner, and it's pretty easy to get one of those on a BC
---
Honestly? Mindless ISK-making that requires little attention or time.  
---
I have a strong dislike of the bulk of the community that thinks everyone should be sporting 65 accounts and multibox them to run their own mining fleets. That's cancer.  
---
What they -did- get right though, is having a character who is absolute beast at 1 particular thing and expanding from there.   
---
For example:  
---
Station Trading sucks. The more slots you get, the more stuff you might buy and flip for a profit. The better your skills, the less you pay in taxes, the more profit at the end. Eventually, you start buying stuff further out for less money. You either contract some wanker to do it for you, or you make an alt that is good at hauling. He hauls some or all of your contracts.  
---
You start getting huge percentage returns on your invested ISK, especially among smaller ISK items in bulk. You start building up an excess of certain items that just refuse to sell, but you need market slots for items that aren't fast movers. Most folks make another market alt. They start the same routine at a different trade hub. They ferry items back and forth between hubs to sell stuff for the best value, either with their own hauling alt or some contracted hauler.  
---
Other folks have explored and connected almost every facet of this game, but some other wankers do things like run SP farms and abuse CCPs broken injector system to make a money fountain.   
---
At the end of it all, the entire game is location, timing, and filling a niche, or being a douche.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVO212wlF24 ?
---
I'm speaking within the context of a game. Ships and money don't matter as much in the context of everyone having so much of it.
---
It certainly needs some iteration, but it has added challenges so I think we can all enjoy that.
---
I hope this is facetious.
---
Hm.  Despite the vitriol I actually agree.  Updooted.
---
Haha lmao yea it is terrible
---
'Good Post'
---
I would rather they try and save retail eve rather than stick a knife in it and call it done.
---
AWWWW YEA
---
It was one fax. If they dropper a super, I'd understand. But neut the fucker out and get on with it.
---
But what if they were? Like just fill them with some random amount of ore and have them "mining" cosmetically.
---
Not much bloc left
---
In the past they did. They were changed.
---
There's literally one step. Build the ship, gratz you've injected isk unless someone does right click trash.
---
I hated this movie so fucking much and the meme that followed was glorious. It's heart-warming to see it used more. Updoot 4 u
---
Pirate Destroyers instead please.
---
Let the Navies have BCs, and the Pirates have DDs. It'd be nice to avoid homogeneity.
---
I want death threats! Now *that* is some serious salt. Someone who sends death threats is asking to be killed repeatedly on principle.
---
^ whining
---
Well, it's funny actually. Unless someone is coming down  the pipe in a force recon.. those 5 to 20 man gangs that come down the fight are pretty much a known quantity. There is no chance they can escalate and you can just drop a hammer or dare them to warp into the belt with 10 rorquals, a few supers and dreads just waiting.
---
There's plenty of us around, mate. People and corps/alliances come and go. That's just how it is; how it's always been. Provibloc remains regardless.
---
&gt;This is my first video and if you all have any advice on starting out I would appreciate it very much.
---
If you can I'd hide your system (top left corner) while streaming. Maybe your overview too (people can figure out where you are based on gates). Some people will look for Eve streams to find PvP targets and gank you. This is even more important if you venture into null or low sec (and you should, they're fun). This isn't as important for videos posted later but livestreams can be risky, especially if you're flying something shiny or have many viewers.
---
I know Bomber's Bar does streams with opsec (hidden info) so you could possibly ask one of their streamers for help. I don't know much about Twitch, though, and it's up to how paranoid you are if it's worth the effort.
---
I'll watch the full thing later and see if I notice anything else. Be aware that *everywhere* is PvP "flagged" in Eve Online...high sec will destroy your attacker but they can still kill you before they die. The best defense is to pay attention and fly what you can afford to lose; cheap ships are rarely ganked as well.
---
Something to keep in mind.
---
Let’s mug him and take his stuff for a proper initiation
---
no, thats the usual EVE way. let's shower him with golden streams of content instead.
---
Thats what it says schleprock 😑
---
CCP needs to stop adding content and start improving the content they already have.
---
Huh, I  posted [a list of fan-made Sansha ships](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d90o4k/literally_unplayable/f1fk2r9/) about an hour ago. Guess I'll repost them here, see if anyone likes them.
---
Me: I can't be an egg. My avatar is still male.  
---
Them: But you're avatar is an MtF.  
---
Me: \*has identify crisis mid talk\*
---
I think they actually made models for those, too...
---
That's web range, not strength.
---
Yeah, though with how slow they've been lately I'm wondering just how bad their legacy code issue is. Do you think attempting to balance the ships right now could actually break the game, like what's happened before?
---
F
---
Right, you were whining.. about whining. And you think I was calling you out on spelling? Hurrdurr
---
Scamming
---
And guess what my friend... You are acting like a child that is high as fuck.
---
Oh dear my chat feelings are now hurt. What ever will I do? 😆
---
Must be a slow day for Init members sucking Goon dicks ehh?
---
Nice stream, really enjoyed the vibe! But damn, this really shows how much ccp need to improve the new player introduction.
---
Awe so I stocked piled these for nothing!
---
 You can fit a 3rd quad mm if you carry it in your cargo, you just have to fit an expended cargohold at your warp in and refit.
---
I ran it a few years ago with meta shield booster but i don't think you needed the 2nd cap battery i guess you could drop it too.
---
From whining to butt hurt responding. Definitely have to remember to send your corp mates a gift basket for doing God's work keeping you on.
---
[https://discord.gg/CUqsRn](https://discord.gg/CUqsRn)
---
Wow thank you! I went for the cowboy bebop vibe but just knowing someone actually enjoyed my stream means the world to me. Thank you so much
---
Jokes on you I stopped playing Eve long time ago. Don't have the time for it. Thanks for worrying about my butt being hurt. Appreciate it.  Have a good night tho 👍
---
Thank you alot for this advice. Wow what a game haha.
---
Thank you so much! and oh hahah
---
Oof!
---
What you really said:
---
&gt; Joked on you, I stopped playing Eve long time ago. I didn't have any friends and now I need to occupy my time sharing my grief and loneliness with others.
---
It’s gone
---
You should have known they weren't going to buff carriers/fighters, bro.
---
why should that be the case
---
haha, goon pets helping pandafam good one
---
Yes, CCP cut costs to the bone. The community team was sacked a couple of years ago. I remember when they all sent out brave sounding Twitter announcements.
---
These insults are great. They might work on someone thin skinned. Thing is you can only really insult a person if you actually know them personally. Anything else is trying too hard. 😆
---
And yet you keep responding and chucking in emojis. /ok
---
Because you amuse me. Do continue.
---
the general process works like this:  
---
1. find a corp you like or wanna join. you can do this many ways, through browsing forums, going on public roams, or just flying around. whatever floats your boat.
---
2. find out how to apply. there's a couple ways to do this but generally most *active* corps are going to pretty much spell it out for you. so here's a few things that might get you headed in the right direction:  
---
  * in any chat channel, including local, type out the name of the corporation. highlight the text, and right click it. now go to Auto Link &gt; Corporation. cool youve now created a clickable link to the corporation you wanna look at. in the corp description most active corporations either link you to a discord or an in-game chat channel to talk with a recruiter. they will help you with the rest of the process.
---
  * if you know you want to join a certain alliance, like goons or something, you can look through their corporations and  see what would be a good fit by doing the same thing in the chat channel but by typing the alliance instead and clicking Auto Link &gt; Alliance. like if you're chinese, there are specific corps that are mostly filled with other chinese players so you always have a nice active group in your timezone to play with.
---
  * never. pay. anyone. anything. to. join. it's a scam, 100% of the time. if people are telling you it's not a scam, guess what - its still a scam and they'll probably laugh at you if you fall for it. don't let people take your shit with zero collateral courier contracts because you think they're being friendly and are going to move it for you. they're not. they're just going to steal it and laugh at you. just be smart and don't fuck up. joining a corporation is when you're really most vulnerable. also if you get turned down, just move on and join a different corporation.  
---
  * speaking of timezone, don't apply to an alliance you aren't in the same timezone with unless you want to be bored out of your fucking mind or like roaming solo for no reason.
---
Toxicity appears when there's no better way to hurt your enemy. Since we can all shoot each other and loss is permanent, we get it out of our systems in a healthy way.
---
mintchip was a meme for a long time for obvious reasons, and then  randomly during the early part of Dust 514's life she was announced as an official  CCP community rep for Dust 514. Obviously this pissed off pretty much everyone since 1. mintchip was shit at eve and had shown essentially zero interest in dust and 2. other more active and reasonable candidates had been overlooked because mintchip had put her name in the hat.  
---
i dont think the announcement thread is even up anymore but within like an hour of her official title being announced it was frozen and i'm pretty sure she didn't last very long in that position  because of the mass community outrage.
---
It’s too late - it’s taken years and lots of little nicks and  cuts to drive eve to it current bottom dwelling place. Ccp doesn’t have the will to do what it takes to try and recapture it’s lost players. It would rather just bleed those that are left for as long as it can.

Do you know how many Faction BC's people would have to lose - to balance with the loss of 1 Faction Super?   
---
Do you want the 10$ gallon of milk? Or the 10$ cup?

for obvious reasons im not going to specify where the pictures in question are on the internet but theyve been online in the same place for like 10 years. idk how recently your word of mouth info is but i'm pretty sure she just disappeared after this happened:

It was largely speculation on my part. There *may* be technical reasons, but I do expect it to be Google just trying to clamp down on the ecosystem.
---
Sell them to rorqual pilots for mining
---
&gt; I would rather they try and save retail eve rather than stick a knife in it and call it done.
---
And i don't really care what doomers have to say about it. Quit, leave. Leave those of us who still care enough to press on.
---
Yes which is extremely unfortunate cuz I've switched over now I might just be doing it for my PC also because having a single ecosystem for all my needs is Handy and that's what I liked about chrome except if I can't block ads with it it's virtually useless

your age is showing there fella

What movie was it? Never seen or heard of it, only this glorious meme.
---
Hey on release they effected fighters I can dream! Lol
---
You get the most salt and death threats from the people in the safest areas with the least at risk.
---
Highsec venture in a dead end system = death threats
---
Titan solo moving through hostile space = aww you got me, good job!
---
When you make a contract to somebody else, the assets are technically counted as being in your possession until the contract is accepted. So if the location was destroyed the contract would be cancelled and the assets would go back into your hangar, which would then be moved to a can in space with the rest of your possessions. Disclaimer: not tested.

Babadook I believe

Fine. Put them on used faction crystals

If you want to get into roleplaying I suggest you check out the [Fiction Portal]](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/fiction-portal) on the official forums, as well as the [old](https://oldforums.eveonline.com/) and [archived](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/) forums if you're interested. There are also some in-game chat and Discord channels for roleplaying, like the Arataka Research Consortium.

Why not just stop using fax and citidels if you don’t like them
---
should just disallows caps and nullified ships from using cynos. this change fucks over hunters by not letting them use cynos on bombers, hics, dics, and asteros just to name the main ones.
---
Except this whole time I’m saying I take no pleasure out of what will happen to them. So unless you are some kind of mind reader or fortune teller you can your bad faith assumptions and stick them up your ass
---
Everyone's favourite gay icon

The Babadook. Essentially, this monster puts a children's book in this woman's home, and it's progressive harassment of the woman's .... eccentric child eventually has her ripe for possession by said monster because she grows to hate her son for being ....himself. It's a LOT of allegoric storytelling... and thought I thought it was -really- stupid, I have to give the writer props for making you wonder -why- things were happening or what they might mean in a different context.
---
That particular meme stems from a scene where, IIRC, her son has been suspended from school for, no shit, bringing a backpack-catapult to school (in response to the monster). She's at her wits end when she screams 'WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE NORMAL!?" and to be honest, I can't remember if he's screaming for something reasonable, like the monster, or if he's screaming... just to scream.

For what it's worth, on both my phone and computer I use;
---
* Ghostery,
---
* Decentraleyes,
---
* Facebook Container.
---
On my phone, I'm more interested in blocking apps from accessing identifying information about me. I have something to mask my addressbook, message history, and cellular network, and a bunch of other things.
---
Would tell you it does depend as always. Plenty of toxic people in eve

Probably was taking away too much time and resources than deemed worthy. Plus anything they say in those videos just add to the number of things people will try to hold them accountable for, which at this point seems to be an insurmountable list indeed
---
I check here daily to finally see CCP hilmar in his Costa Rican mansion holding up his middle finger saying thx for the isk.
---
If you *see* the recon pilot more than 2 seconds before the cyno goes up, they've done fucked up.
---
People are already adjusting to this pretty well, tbh. The cyno recons can use covops bridges, so you can still just hunt using covops frigs, leaving the real cyno on a bridger ready to drop him.
---
So you never see the recon until you're already in deep shit, and it still doesn't take more than a Prospect to drop a ton of supers/FAUX on top of you.  And with the inexplicable decision to let blops use indy cynos, you can even still bait using T1 haulers, using blops to light the cap cyno when a target is committed.
---
Sure, it requires an additional step in between the inital springing of the trap and the caps/supers landing on grid, but it's only a matter of seconds for a decent group.
---
They paid someone for this. Talk about krabs...

---
Hunters can use covert cynos. Covert cyno in and blops bridge a recon, light hard cyno, No problem. Alternatively you can Stage recons in each constellation you normally hunt in. Afk them or log them off. Move your hunter around active systems until you find something worth catching, then catch.
---
Ask any hunter, any real hunter, it doesn’t matter if your ship can light a regular cyno: hunting is hunting.
---
excellent choice of music. god bless.

Cloaks already exist.
---
100? So like a fleets worth.
---
I had an opportunity to go to one of their dev conference after parties a long time ago. They had strippers and midgets serving beer. Definitely was not kid (or wife) safe. They've toned it down a lot over the years.
---
Excellent, thankyou for the response.
---
&gt;	old Pandemic Horde was similar a monarchy with a royal court, but I'd guess that had a lot to do with being structured (at the time) around one massive corporation and a few tiny ones
---
You mean Horde has evolved away from being Gobbins as king and Nidia as the Hand? Do tell.
---
legit thought (or wanted [that], at least) this guy was looking for a corp to rp as a badass fighter pilot
