Huh, interesting implication on the total value of PH. Looks like we're worth roughly 1.7T.
---
---
---
Hisec players whined that nullsec has too many advantages and their mining and mission running is not profitable.
---
Thats the point, if they are forced to have an alt, they will have to buy more plex or game time.
---
Eh, organ harvesting is where it's at. Drugs are fine and all, but people will raid you and try to take them. If people raid you to try and get your organs, boom... More organs.
---
Damn, this actually sounds like a great idea. 
---

---
This... this is r/eve right... wtf is going on?
---
Wait CCP did something in lowsec?
---
You dont do nuance do you, literally at all.
---
Chopper flying, engine begins to fail, chopper pilot has a single place to put it where it wont result in a loss of life or property other than the chopper, he then lands the chopper in the tree.
---
That chopper is exactly where its supposed to be even if it doesn't look like that to you.
---
Yep. They talk a lot about new players. Stuff like that would simply make them (and most players I would suppose) even more risk averse.
---
&gt; You must really hate gay people. 
---
What makes you say that? What if I'm actually gay myself? See how you look at something and dont know what you're talking about and it makes you look like an asshole?
---
&gt;You are the one who started that, I just responded in kind. Its definitely not me whose the human piece of garbage here. You have done nothing but essentially been a rude, disgusting person since you started posting. You are the one that is the human garbage by far and its sad you dont realize it.
---
You cried about a coming change on a public form then called people who didn't agree with your complaint 'scared', you've earned nothing but being treated the way you're being treated.
---
&lt;&lt;if nobody has noticed, our old Geminate staging system appears to have developed a static wormhole problem. The new might be having the same issue.&gt;&gt;
---
&gt;That chopper is exactly where its supposed to be even if it doesn't look like that to you.
---
It's literally not, like that's not something you can argue against, a helicopter is not mean to land in a tree, shits fucked up yo.  You are a herp derp sir.
---
They are already here: https://i.imgur.com/fWJ2VAb.jpg
---
Of course, because they have more of it due to WHs shitting out money.
---
If you look at a "money created vs money destroyed" ratio, Wormholes have the highest ratio.
---
Apologizes, I realized after I posted you were.....what you are. I choose not to explain metaphysics to a dog, try to teach a snake to jump, or do other futile deeds. Thus there is no reason to engage you in conversation. So, your right. You do you.
---
Well, I am just saying that in general Disintegrators are known for high tracking.
---
You can check out anytime you like,
---
but you can never leave.
---
weebs out
---
alphas get half the sp
---
And they get 12,000-20,000 every week so that is a meaningless number when you realize a large number of them are alpha accounts that can be instantly recreated and begin botting again.
---
Our kestrels will block out the sun!
---
OK, on this fleet it's your turn to main the in-cyno, since none of us have alts. Have fun. Maybe next time someone else can do it and YOU can drop a cap as well.
---
When you pour out of a wormhole and drop on a dude 20 or 30 to 1, it's cool. When null wants to do it to you, it's not. That's called bullshit.
---
Lol, again, you dont do nuance, maybe the tree was the only place the chopper could be put down, you're not a fucking pilot so you have quite literally no fucking idea, and yet you somehow insist you're right that the chopper shouldn't be there.
---
Maybe there was literally nowhere else it could go that would be safe, you have literally no fucking idea.
---
You just look at it and go "NOPE SHOULDN'T BE HERE" while everybody else is calling the pilot a hero for saving everybody on board.d
---
You're the type of dumb motherfucker who would have rode by Chesley Sullenberger's plane in the river and gone "wow he fucked up and landed that in the wrong place" when in actuality he landed it in the perfect place that saved every single human on the plane and avoided damage to the city and probable catastrophic loss of life.
---
Or you could roam out of the hole instead of rage rolling for the back door.
---
I wonder how big the Tranquility Tower’s bounty would get if this was implemented
---
~~Allied~~ race - Jovians, coming to ~~WoW~~ EvE in 2022
---
didn’t let me get it on my alphas
---
&gt; I’m still waiting for the day Eve introduces a ship that has 200 guns that 10 different people could control and 1 person pilot. 
---
so a pos?
---
worked for me vOv
---
EvE, a game with features that let you "do something else" rather than playing that ~~boring~~ exciting game
---
Ccp stated wormholers represent 3 to 5 % of the population. That means 3 to 5 % of the population made 12t in blue loot vs. ALL of null (representing over half the player base) making 29t in ratting isk.
---
That means that wormhole isk value in this equation correlates to wormholers making on average. 5 % of the game made a third of what 50 % made. In other words.. they made 4x as much on a per person level.
---
Filthy carebears.
---
well the train time goes up per level even tho the bonus doesnt; i think wat they meant is its generally better to get several to lvl 4 than just 1 at lvl 5.
---
It has been about 28 years since I took Intermediate accounting.  But here is what I learned from 30 years in business....   These are only games for the accountants and the revenue only counts when it comes to taxes and those providing your finance (bank, shareholders,  etc.).  In the meantime, I live by the cashflow.  
---
When CCP finally dies, be it in a year, 10 or 100, there are two things guaranteed:
---
1- There will be unredeemed PLEX in someone Vault or hangar somewhere.
---
2- The cash will not be returned to that person.
---
ITT: The bait is taken
---
Eve's engine is an in-house custom job.
---
What about day trippers?  As someone who exclusively hunts in WH’s, most of the ratters I kill don’t live in a wormhole
---
I'm not sure if they even track that. Or how.
---
&gt; On top of all of this blue income you have also materials for whole T3 production in New Eden. 
---
By this logic, we should remove all bounties from kspace and all payout should come in the form of drugs manufacturing materials. Because only k-space gets drug-materials.  
---
What an asinine argument.
---
Every time I deployed in the past, I logged my Supercapitals off in a safe spot off dscan. Anyone who logged it on a structure for more than a couple of days is just asking for trouble. Wasn’t there a Supercapital recently killed at a POS in Stain that someone watched for years?
---
Nice paraphrase
---
Assuming the country that botter lives in has no electric bill, yeah, absolutely a net gain
---
Is that on a total volume per structure volume? Or a per character amount? Because both can be abused.
---
That’s one my overall points,  people that think all this isk is made by a wormhole people is an incorrect assessment.   In the grand scheme of things it’s a very small amount of isk per hole per day per person
---
I mean, they'd just unanchor/transfer to holding corp to be killed, and set up the next one.
---
Sounds good, roll the hole and trap yourself inside in a single pass, combating super proliferation 1 retard at a time
---
Yup, none of this is incorrect lol
---
You can keep pinging all the higher powers you want, but that's not going to change the fact that you're blatantly stating incorrect facts for your own gain. A lot of people can see that. A lot of people don't like people shilling for things based on lies.   
---
You yourself even admitted that you were probably quoting fake numbers.  
---
It's not brigading, you're just wrong and people know it.
---
Disgusting. Anime is cartoons.
---
When they state that wormholers represent 3 to 5 %, they are saying that people that use wormholes represent a very small segment. In all likelihood that includes day tripper isk makers.
---
Bob never was.  The deity of Wormholes doesn't care who ship gets blown up, but only that they do blow up. And the salt must flow.
---
I have not run abyssals in a while but the Gila is always the best bet upto T3
---
&gt; Lol, again, you dont do nuance, maybe the tree was the only place the chopper could be put down, you're not a fucking pilot so you have quite literally no fucking idea, and yet you somehow insist you're right that the chopper shouldn't be there.
---
lol Because it isnt supposed to land in the tree.  You're just wrong.
---
&gt;You're the type of dumb motherfucker who would have rode by Chesley Sullenberger's plane in the river and gone "wow he fucked up and landed that in the wrong place" when in actuality he landed it in the perfect place that saved every single human on the plane and avoided damage to the city and probable catastrophic loss of life.
---
Lol lot of conflating info there, careful you dont start getting random shit stuck to your bo- oh wait...
---
Just cause it landed there doesnt it was supposed to...you are a very big idiot.
---
I'm not sure how many condors there were but that's pratically ganking haha. Lots of cheap ships against solo players
---
More null to null holes would be awesome too
---
&gt; You shouldn't be punished for not playing the game 
---
You definitely should though. Why is it problematic that you might lose your ship if you don't play but its not a problem if you lose your space if you don't play?
---
&gt; People take breaks from the game, go on vacation, or are just generally too busy to play at times 
---
Thats fine, keep your shit safe while your afg. If you can't, or you're to lazy to, then you have to much shit.
---
&gt;  If that happened and I came back to see my titan disappeared, I'd just quit 
---
Good.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;If i was afk, undocked in space in a giant spaceship and my ship just disappeared because i wasn't at my keyboard then I'd just quit. Not everyone can be a neckbeard who sits at their computer for more than ten minutes at a time. Sometimes we have to get up and pee and we shouldn't be penalized for doing that.
---
This is basically what you're saying. If docking up when you go afk isn't to much to ask, then having to make sure your stuff is safe before you afg shouldn't be to much to ask either.
---
You had to suddenly go afg because of things outside of your control? Fine, things like that happen, albeit rarely. But the risk of that happening and then losing all of your assets should be a part of the risk you take moving to null.
---
You had to suddenly go afk because of something outside of your control? Fine things like that happen. The risk of losing whatever your were undocked in is a part of the risk inherent to undocking things in eve.
---
I don't think theres any real difference between those two statements.
---
There are tools to deal with having to suddenly go afk, npc stations and cloaks and things, and it might be worth talking about making sure that there are similar types of mechanics in place for docked assets, but simply asserting that you have the right to have assets that are not and can never be at risk is the most entitled thing i can imagine in a game thats all about managing risk.
---
If 50,000 people log in over a 24 hour period.. (it’s more) and wormholes are 5% of the population.  That’s 155mil/hole per day
---
&gt;What makes you say that? What if I'm actually gay myself? See how you look at something and dont know what you're talking about and it makes you look like an asshole?
---
Calling me a faggot alot mostly.  But see how you ignore obvious shit you say?  It makes you look like an asshole.
---
&gt; You cried about a coming change on a public form then called people who  didn't agree with your complaint 'scared', you've earned nothing but  being treated the way you're being treated. 
---
It's funny how you try to downplay everything by calling it crying.  You're like the schoolyard bully trying to still use those tactics as an adult...but I guess you just never grew up.  Also no I havent earned that, you're just literally being an asshole to be one.  If anything its what you've earned that you're trying to project on other people.
---
Part of the system would be a refund of a percentage of the ISK if the structure is taken down. Also that would suck for stability/clones/all market orders in your station.
---
I did that too. Now what?
---
I am still waiting for the ~~Hentai~~ Anime adaptation
---
I mean, if you are going to use the total number of systems as your talking point rather than players in said space (which is entirely disingenuous) then you can make up whatever numbers you like. Heck, there could be 10 guys in WH space and because you are referencing systems not players, 12T would still seem good to you! 95 % of the population of eve lives in 5201 non WH systems and generated 29t isk. 5 % of the population live in 2500 WH and that space generated 12T.
---
Can you not whine so much? Gosh.
---
If anyone could move to where they wanted to be instantly there wouldn't be an eve to play. Get real son go play wow classic.
---
&gt;What do you think is the limit of soloing? 
---
staying awake.
---
literally all my losses from abyssal space come from just flat out not paying attention because repeating the same thing over and over isn't particularly engaging and my attention wanders.
---
Not saying ns isn't also a problem, strawman.
---
If I saw 15 damaviks in a T5 without blue cloud I would just self-destruct
---
So if 1/2 of the wormhole systems have some form of activity.. that’s 300m/day each hole generates.  
---
Systems in delve generate 3.45bil per day per system in bounties and ore.
---
now add the player density, delve alone have 50 000 + player I doubt wh space have even 10 % of this
---
You're nuts if you think that's accurate. It's like saying 50% of null income is people ninja ratting..
---
Lold
---
Based on the information in devblog he made a bunch of rigs.  
---
  
---
Realized he's been cheated.  
---
Finally accepted the truth and decided to cash out.
---
Are you actively avoiding basing in on actual accounts to obfuscate or are you really not aware that it's the person doing the activity that generates the isk and not the system simply existing that generates the income?
---
I love your way of throwing math all around the place, it remind me people talking about flat earth with "science"
---
&gt;math genius
---
&gt;think blue loot is underpower because you compare their value to an area farm by thousand of player every day

That's a neat idea. I'd like to see that.
---
if you actually come back with 20-30 comparable ships we'd fight. we're not expecting a fight from 1 ratter nor should you expect a fight from 20 guys with 100 guys ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Many of the wormholers i know make isk from PI and than pew pew the people daytripping in.  A 10 man corp can farm out their hole in a matter of an hour and it takes days to respawn all the sigs again  (unlike NS)    
---
Just saying...

Lmao, I swear to god, eve players are peak r/iamverysmart fodder
---
Just what i studied, it is relevant... even if that is an upsetting fact for you
---
Written more in Python than it should be.
---
I think if the chance of getting rolled in.. so to speak is much less, a lot of null would actually bring a decent fight into the hole. I can speak for everyone though.
---
All RL politics from here on out will result in a temp ban. Seriously, this is an Eve online meetup how is this even an issue.

WTB Jin'taan's Frozen Corpse

I may do that one day. I day trip in WH but do find it rather stale most of the time. Sure the drops are better but you can dscan in a cloaky ship and stay very safe. I prefer the massive fleet engagements null has. There is something about two major powers going to all out war that is just a blast. I guess the mass thing would take away a lot of what makes WH a WH and would ultimately make it an extension of null.
---
To be frank I think all these changes are bullshit, they aren't fixing anything they are putting bandaids on big issues. Yes capital proliferation is a problem, I think we all agree on that, but this isn't the solution. Not only that but they created this problem with skill injectors to try and grab quick money allowing people to drop a few hundred bucks and make a 3 hour old titan pilot.
---
I think we all agree changes need to be made, but the ones they are making aren't the right changes. We need more actual content both pvp and pve, we need less pay2win bullshit (kill skill injectors) and we need new interesting ways to wage war. Lets face it as much as everyone hates us, groups like Goons are the ones who cause the gaming articles to be written that pull in new blood with tales of 4000 player battles, corp theft, and losses in the thousands of dollars. Yes EVE needs some changes but little bullshit like blackouts and cyno changes will do fuckall to make any real progress
---
If only there was some way for people to watch system entrances or otherwise scout the area and communicate what they see. Or, maybe if there was some way to find out what your most commonly encountered enemies were planning to do.
---
Alphastarpilot?
---
He’ll make them permanent. Titans no longer dock, no longer log, you log out, your char is still ingame, so is the titan.  It’s immune if near your safety keepstar or dock.  Titan turns back into a coffin for characters.
---
For fucking real. Honestly looking back, most of the times I've stopped playing Eve for any length of time it's been because of r/eve and the constant catastrophizing. Like fuck it's just so depressing.
---
Are you flying frigates? If you're looking for profit over challenge, buy and fit a nice active tanked Gila and there's no reason you can't cakewalk T4s &amp; T5s solo with the right implants and standby drugs.    
---
Even a passive purger-fit Gila can cakewalk everything up to and including T3s, and will only sometimes die in a T4 - it will die though.
---
I think if that hole connect between Perimeter and NS, the NS corp will get most benefits because they can bring many ships as convoy to protect freighter group. But also increase the risk HS corps raid NS and citadels on that wh space
---
Makes arguement people only make 150m per day then says he makes trillions in whs
---
It hurts itself in its own confusion.
---
This thing was in game when I started back in 2009.
---
I think.. But it has been long time. Just an easter egg.
---
&gt; There's never not a chain leading from K-space to ones wormhole. Might take a little to scan but they are always there 
---
This isn't strictly true, your chain can absolutely loop back on itself making one that doesn't have a k-space.
---
More commonly though you'll find a chain with only eol exits that are far enough away from your roller that it can't get back in time.
---
Op says whlers only make 150m per day then says he makes trillions in whs.
---
you obviously dont actually play/live in wormholes, or probably pvp either...
---
actual WH players want to raise their hands as to how many roll their holes looking for pvp content...
---
Has someone killed it? If it is a static complex, there’s usually some person (often a Russian), who logs in immediately after downtime and runs the complex. You can probably find the item you need on contracts.
---
People that know me know that I make all my isk market trading or looting wrecks, not doing PVE in WHs.  I only shoot at people in WHs.
---
Because everyone think it is dangerous to come to hole too near on trade hubs and its right. Usually I use them to haul goods from NS to Jita to sell and buy goods from that trade hub.
---
JUST POPPED ONE IN PAYE
---
Let me explain to you why rolling wormholes/statics is too safe. 
---
Lets say you have a Naglfar in a C6 with a C5 static and you want to run sites safely and make some of the best isk per hour in the game...
---
Step 1: Scan holes down and scout them really quick.
---
Step 2: Roll holes with appropriate ships.
---
Step 3: Do not scan down new static. If left unscanned after rolled, new static will take 1-4 hours to show up (I forget how long)
---
Step 4: Krab with no connections open to your wormhole. Chances of a fleet rolling into you are very low. Just be wary of new signature spawns.
---
You can literally have a system with 0 connections to anything... Just a lone system - sitting by itself... No connections... To anything...
---
Change this CCP.
---
Just think how great a mixed BEEEN/AFK or BEEEN/HK fleet would be :D Braxus would probably have an aneurysm
---
I don't anymore.
---
People talk about beta damage all the time. Every time ANTIFA has a protest in Portland, for example.
---
Used to be this
---
If nullsec is going to be fucked with, so should WH space.
---
Such is life in Black Rise; gank, get ganked, repeat!
---
&gt; So you telling me in a C5 to C5 you are only running site in your home hole? 
---
Most 5-5 corps make isk on alts in farm holes, not in their home or in their static since that generally means no-one can pvp while a couple people make isk.
---
Most of the people that live in WHs roll holes to be safe, and those people don’t post on Reddit.  The ones that DO post here are the PVPers 
---
Actually almost everything I’ve ever done in EVE is WH related (besides my market toons)
---
...and the other 75% were obviously bots, anyways.
---
Cant wait for them to immediately make the signature pop in probe window and become scannable on the k162 side when you roll a static wormhole. Atleast that would help people find each other or atleast make em deploy scouts instead of just closing a wormhole. Wormhole space is now arguable safer than nullsec.
---
you mean... like... NPSI fleets?
---
Yes, because making it so one side can bring 5 caps and the other side only 1 is good for the WH Meta
---
You'll be back one day.
---
Snuff deliberately doesn't have one but yeah I mean I've had the experience. I bought my current Nyx in a keepstar, JF'd a fit from Jita which was really nice. I also left it docked in a public keepstar for a couple months while I used the toon for [this](https://zkillboard.com/kill/63507899/).
---
I'm not in favour adding tedium to the game generally and I'm not suggesting removing supercap docking from Keepstars is really a good solution (or a solution at all), I was just saying I don't think it'd really big a big deal for anyone who has dedicated pilots for their supers.
---
Just spitballing it since we're talking, I've had this really dumb comical idea of like CCP do a significant but not massive nerf to supers/titans and halve their cost while they're at it. Then add super super capitals that have the same relative power level over current supercapitals (with their new nerfed stats) as current supers do over regular capitals and have the price be some appropriate multiple. _Those_ supersupercaps (we can work on the name) then have all the same docking/production/etc restrictions we're talking about having for current supercaps.
---
That way you get free reign to fix the balance problems with current supers, you still have a difficult to acquire "biggest toy", and you do it without screwing over people who already own them too hard.
---
Anime was a mistake, gas the weebs.
---
They could always hard cap the number of caps that can jump through a hole
---
Elo is now in an alliance with blatant RMT and botting that's completely destroying the economy of the server but okay lmao.

I do believe I still have my jewel case copy
---
i thought you said you dont pve?
---
Small correction, heat damage is not the value of heat added as well, just the heat damage done when it does damage.  
---
Heat dissipation is the factor there.  For example, T2 Shield Hardeners are 3.4 Heat Damage, and 2% Heat per cycle, while Faction Shield Hardeners are 4.0 Heat Damage, but 1% Heat per cycle.  
---
Eve handles heat like resistances (where it is actually anti-heat in the code).  This causes heat generation to accelerate with the current heat level. (eg Current Heat Level * HeatDissipationModifier).
---
The result of this is you want to use Low HeatDissipation Modules early, and low heat damage modules later.
---
The overview gives the correct amount of information.
---
I'll trash a super carrier if that ever happens. 
---
Quote me on it.
---
having knowledge of game mechanics doesn't mean i do it.  I have 120mil SP and have never sat in a rorqual, i know how they work and know how the mechanics work
---
Haha, oh man that sucks. I was just talking about EVE scout caches though, which are placed specifically so they can be easily located without bookmarks.
---
&gt;refund of a percentage
---
fuck that, refund the whole thing.
---
I think a lot of people have hope in the potential.
---
Nobody is going to undock for some solo nerd derping around it's not worth the time playing cat and mouse unless you're really bored. For all they know the dork chirping in local is just a cyno, so again nobody is going to undock for some solo nerd derping around.
---
What’s the go with active tanked Gila’s over passive? Does the active tank have much better burst tank over the passive?
---
Definitely an option. I was thinking there was a way to abuse that, but after thinking for a bit, probably not. So 100% refund should be good.
---
This actually makes a bit of sense.
---
The fundamental problem with the bounty system is that EVE is not real life. IRL, most people don't try and kill everyone they can get their hands on. In EVE, if you see someone you think you can take, you're going to shoot them. Them having a bounty or not is irreverent to the decision. Instead of encouraging people to kill the target, bounties just give random rewards to people who were probably going to kill them anyway.
---
Structures are different though, because they usually involve boring, dangerous grinds that most people can't be arsed to do unless they're at war with the target (or it's in WH space and they think there might be enough loot involved to make it worth their while). A bounty can change that.
---
The issue is that a bounty big enough to entice people to destroy the structure would probably probably be worth more then the raw cost of the structure itself, which opens of the can of worms of someone shooting their own structure to get the rewards. You can limit the payout like is currently done with ships, but that might make the reward too small to be worth it.
---
Ever dog has his day I guess. Between all the stain guy posts, something good was bound to be suggested.
---
If structure bounties were a thing I wouldn't mind cleaning up the trash. S couple of afk oracle's to make a buck? Not s bad idea. Even if it is shit isk, it's isk
---
Nope.  you can Win EvE using a variety of strategies.
---
Realizing EvE is great when reading about it as valid as any other method.
---
That is possible! I did get a GM to reset for me so i will try again tomorrow.
---
you seem upset. hopefully they do whatever you are afraid of.
---
607 comments say otherwise
---
Nerf C6/C5 buff C4
---
Right, keep trying to tell me you got it hard when you can roll your static with a single cap to find your content. GTFO. I lived in wormholes and it's a fucking cake walk compared to travel in null.
---
https://www.autohotkey.com/
---
Yes, well technically, possibly, potentially banable under the EULA, this is one of those situations where it wouldn't be since setting up a hotkey to simulate a double click for you would fall under the "isn't giving you gains at at an accelerated rate" rule.
---
You can very easily use autohotkey to fall foul of that rule... but if you're JUST using a keyboard shortcut to emulate a double mouse click you're fine.
---
&gt; You may not use your own or any third-party software, macros or other stored rapid keystrokes or other patterns of play that facilitate acquisition of items, currency, objects, character attributes, rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary Game play.
---
you can roam delve from period basis. what a dumb post.
---
thats what this sub is for, right? spewing salt all over everybody else?
---
rarely does anything productive come out of this shithole, so ill spew my salt here on, and be productive and helpful other places.
---
What if there was a fatigue system? You would take a random %loss on a ships bonus. Possibly 2 bonus could be affected depending on the class or tier. I also feel there should be a new skill with the purpose to lessen the effects of this, like with drugs.
---
Drifter holes were a shot at this, I think. They work fairly well without being broken.
---
I think the nature of EVE is that many of the things worth doing take time and patience. It's the thing that keeps bringing me back. I don't mind that and I think the rarity of great accomplishments (like killing a wormhole Keepstar, conducting an invasion, being a legendary solo pilot, manipulating markets, etc.) is one of the marks of its greatness. Not everyone can do it because not everyone can commit to that.
---
OTOH you should definitely be able to do *some* things without making EVE your full time job.
---
"Most corps" eh? The only people with farm holes are the bigger guys that can defend them. Yes, people do farm the C5 statics in a C5-C5.
---
he could have trickled them out easily, even though it was a shitload.
---
I'm spending the PLEX and Subscription money I set aside for EVE to spend on people who make sense on /r/EVE instead of giving it to CCP. Thank you for being a logical member of /r/EVE. Enjoy A week without ads.
---
Get gud noob
---
This video was amazing. Nice music too.
---
Think of it like a bet. With a passive fit, you're guaranteed to die when your ehp runs out but you're betting the npcs that you'll kill them before it happens. With an active fit, you're in a position (capacitor allowing) to repair some of that damage and stave off death long enough to win your bet.    
---
With a bling fit you can perma-rep the damage, but with a bling passive fit, you're still gambling - and if/when you get a neut-heavy spawn that ehp is gonna vanish damned quickly once your hardeners turn off.    
---
Even if you scrape through, it's going to take so long to passively regen enough shields back to safely start the next 'room' that your going to be pushing the limit on your 20 min timer once you hit the higher tiers.    
---
Taking a passive fit into a T5 is a death sentence.
---
Does it? I can't see values being given so isn't it just being scaled against the highest values?
---
Now there's a relic from the past.
---
THIS. I long train almost everything because I have been against Skill Injectors from the start. I trained over 30 fucking cyno alts and got them set up the DAY the announced the cyno changes. I long trained 12 rorqs. I long trained 4 titans. I long trained 6 perfect sub cap pilots. All this from back in 2008. 
---
I didn't spend real life $$$ to get all these alts, but it was a significant amount of subscription time. To add to what /u/allbur_chellak said, I was one of those people willing to throw over $40,000 to CCP over the decade or so I've been playing and not think twice because EVE was my hobby. The recent changes this summer have all but driven me away from EVE. Yeah, I still have some play style in small gang stuff and low sec and large fleets and a few sigs in TEST, but that's only half my play style. CCP has killed smart bomb ratting, killed rorq mining once cyno changes go live, and forced two of my real life friends to quit EVE because they can't even VNI/Domi Rat now. They quit when the drifter shit started. 
---
All this being said here you go: 
---
&gt; Can't wait for the era of chaos to put an end to huge mainstream newsworthy capital engagements when the cyno changes go in.
---
Personally, I'm rooting for capitals to be removed from the game, fam. I'll settle for 'useless and unplayable' though.
---
Making ratting - the basic concept of ship combat - more "engaging" is pretty difficult. Anything that hinges on repeated a certain number of steps over and over is going to be easily automated.
---
And this is the player base CCP is killing off. 
---
I subbed all mine with IRL $$$. But this is exactly why I finally quit. 
---
Implying that you're going to stop shitposting in the sub unlike the rest of us who have quit.
---
&gt; Just cause it landed there doesnt it was supposed to
---
thats actually exactly what it means because a qualified expert put it right there and everybody lived.
---
like can you imagine doing your job and having some asshole dressed like you come up an go "that doesn't look right you must have done it wrong", even though said asshole has no idea what it took to get what you've done done, or how its supposed to go.
---
like holy shit the arrogance, so far in this thread you're a better dev than actual devs, a better ceo than an actual ceo, and now a better pilot than actual pilots.
---
meanwhile nobody shows up to your job and tells you how to cut grass
---
Hunter comes into system, scans you down and warps to you hitting his covops cloak as he goes into warp. You either get lucky and see him by hitting Dscan in the 2 seconds he's uncloaked or you see him when he uncloaks in range of you and already tackling you. There is no skill past spamming V involved. That would be like me claiming my kills as an F1 monkey involved skill on my part.
---
A not insignificant part of those new accounts are said bots you mention can just be recreated...
---
and let's face it, even with the NPE as "fresh" as it is, eve has a terrible retention rate on new players. This isn't a game that appeals to the mass market; many will try it and just stop.
---
its hard for you se the reality? =P
---
New RMT method. Place bounty on structure have dude who's buying isk kill it
---
Actually, this is the post that made me do this, so here you go. 
---
This is exactly how I feel. 
---
too cursed. too cursed.
---
Yep.    
---
I rarely run sites any more as I don't really need the isk, but they were getting so routine the only danger was from splitting my attention. I've had a few close calls from spending more time chatting with Twitch steamers, or listening to TiS during controversial topics.    
---
And it really should go without saying, but actually just 'staying awake' as you say - flying expensive ships in the Abyss while really tired is asking for trouble. I've certainly lost a few bill from accidentally activating the wrong type of filament altogether - once you click the confirmation, that's it. No undo.
---
What part of your idea seems fun?
---
accidentally activating that dark fillament you got as a drop in the last site... bad times entirely.
---
i think pretty much all of my recent losses have been me activating a site and thinking i can sorta half arse it while i get ready for work in a morning. apparently trying to find a matching pair of socks is my leading cause of hawk losses.
---
flair checks out
---
I seem to distinctly remember public outcry resulting in a couple reversed changes, most notably the fighter nerfs during late 2016?
---
How on Earth do you justify claiming that CCP has "been at the beck and call of the people that wanted safer null"?  
---
I realize CCP has been overly catering to your low-risk killmail-farming playstyle for far too long, but your sense of entitlement is still virtually unbelievable. The nullsec empires built themselves through enormous amounts of work and a great deal of time, not through "CCP being at their beck and call". Believe it or not, you don't DESERVE to kill those people and CCP had no obligation to negate all of their hard work just so that you could continue receiving killmails for a fraction of the effort they put into defending themselves. If you want to kill them so badly, put in the kind of effort they did and build your own empire to fight them with. 
---
You DO realize that just because CCP made a trend of catering to your play style does not mean that you are entitled to such treatment indefinitely, right? Just because you are accustomed to getting what you want 100% of the time does not mean that someone else getting their way once in a while constitutes CCP being at that other party's beck and call. You sound like either a child or SJW. 
---
If you STILL can't manage to kill people, despite the great lengths CCP goes to to make it easy for you, maybe it's time for you to look for another game.
---
\&gt; Step 3: Do not scan down new static. If left unscanned after rolled, new static will take 1-4 hours to show up on the K162 side of the static. (I forget how long)   
---
This is not correct. If you or anyone else, does not initiate warp to it, the hole does not spawn the K162.
---
Yeah... you're corp/alliance mates. Everyone and everything else is open game
---
&gt; run relic sites for a few days.
---
you're running the wrong relic sites.
---
Are you a boomer?
---
The part where upwell and Jita 4-4 are mentioned in the same sentence scares me...
---
bazooper
---
Nah I'm not with Empty You. Although I do appreciate the salt in this reaction. Mobile Depots are a waste of time better spent popping MTUs. Plus you can't shoot em in high sec. There's no unknown intent, both Empty You and myself are there to piss in Cheerios. That's the schtick.
---
I'm honestly sick to death of CCP using the NPE as an excuse for players not staying with the game. Years ago they blamed the NPE for retention, then they retooled the fuck out of it, completely redesigned the UI, all with the stated purpose of keeping players in teh game and somehow after all that time and work the NPE is still somehow the problem from their point of view. The issue is the game play for large parts of eve is incredibly boring and repetitive and they continue to refuse to address that issue. They don't need a better NPE, they need to start using the NPE to funnel players into a corporation with people in it who can show them what eve is really about.
---
We will find out Saturday morning if he starts mowing the lawn.
---
you're definitely right that there is something I misunderstood. So I made a few tests
---
I used a compact tracking computer. When I look at fitted module stat, it tells me 2.48hp damage ; the stats are 
---
HeatAbsorbtionRateModifier: 0.009999999776482582
---
HeatDamage: 3.299999952316284
---
so after two cycles of 10s, according to you it should be 2% heat but instead it was 14%.
---
Then I did the same with a sensor booster II.modified heat damage is 2.55, stats are 
---
HeatAbsorbtionRateModifier: 0.019999999552965164
---
HeatDamage: 3.4000000953674316
---
after two cycles of 10s, it was 26% heat on the middle rack.
---
Then I tried two cycles with a "greaves" medium armor repairer (modified heat  3.98 by skills)
---
HeatDamage: 5.300000190734863
---
after two cycles of 9s  it was 11% heat in low rack. 
---
So I came to the conclusion that your formula is not correct either.
---
Also I checked on a video(that I made), and the heat of the rack is divided by two every 68s(wrote the timestamp at which it went from 94 to 64,32, and 16 and between the three there was exactly 68s). That means you lose 1.014 % of you heat every second ( =100 - 100\*0.5\^(1/68) )
---
Yeah I was kinda joking. It was a bad joke :).
---
Or maybe they just PvP more and don't hide under a supercap umbrella. vOv
---
&gt; There is no skill past spamming V involved.
---
Yea my bad i thought you meant the hunter, theres actual skill in a hunter using his dscanner
---
&gt;I was wrong, but instead of being man enough to admit my mild error, I'm going to just insult you instead, and put on airs of superiority.
---
Awful grind for for the ISK. What citadels can a solo ship even break the damage cap on?
---
Uhhh, wat?
---
A Large POS, even with a SOV bonus will eat about 500 mil in fuel a month. Setup cost is 300-400mil.
---
As opposed to an astrahus with a clone bay which will only sip about 150mil/month. But the setup cost is 1+bil.
---
Industry example, back in the day I ran a dual large tower setup and it chugged though 1 bil/month total with the SOV bonus. Later on I had an athanor setup with similar profits while also running reprocessing and it only cost about 280mil/month.
---
My point is, people are whining about PCU, but people also whined that they wanted bots banned. The bots got banned. PCU fell as a result.
---
Sure, they can just make new accounts if their credit cards/paypals/IPs aren't banned. But those are new accounts they have to train/inject back up.
---
&gt;This isn't a game that appeals to the mass market
---
Look at the games that do, and then tell me you'd honestly rather play those games than EVE.
---
Point is - it's dumb to be able to be able to rat in a system with ZERO connections up.
---
What do you think happens to the battleship when it uncloaks and the hunter's 17 friends land on grid? Battleship goes boom first, mining barges next.  Quite frankly, mining barges in a standing fleet don't stand a chance either unless the fleet is actually already on grid. The only mining ship that has any chance is a Rorqual, and if you are in one of those you probably have supers in the standing fleet so almost anything will be safe.
---
Before the changes you could mine in small groups or solo and get away with it a lot of the time. The losses were relatively easy to absorb as long as you weren't an idiot. Now, it's not worth undocking a mining barge if you aren't going out with a group of 10 or more with on grid protection.
---
I made a suggestion that the NPE should focus on teaching newbies how to interact with other players, and to direct newbies to EVE University or other approved training corps. Suggestion was predictably shat upon.
---
Nothing, if there are more vegan pansies that pay more/more often. You don't have to cook as much steak and steadily charge more for the side dishes that come with the all-you-can-eat tofu. Your costs go down and revenue goes up. You piss off the steak-eaters, but they were coming by less frequently anyhow.
---
Top problem in all video gaming... the 1% want the coolest things, but the 99% will actually pay for them and can't be bothered to grind for them.
---
Why play if you don’t enjoy it?  Quit and find a new game.
---
Except for everyone else that does it? I don't belong to a big group of gankers, so when I do it it's just me and my alt. Shit requires some planning and work. It's challenging with two capsuleers.
---
&gt;The bots got banned. PCU fell as a result.
---
The correlation isn't there though. The massive player drop happened POST blackout. The massive ban wave the just announced happened BEFORE June. The players should have been missing for 6 more weeks if the player drop was going to be caused by the ban wave.
---
Wait, people actually play this game? Like, *in game*, flying around, clicking the buttons and all that?
---
Though there is a few numbers that top 177013 on the NOPE factor. My brain is already too cursed with seeing those ones.
---
If someone makes a less whiny r/eve I’d visit it
---
Pretty sure you can kill an Astrahus or a raitaru with a solo (polarized?) oracle or another battle cruiser like it.
---
This is honestly a great idea, would upvote twice if I could
---
Current UI is pretty sweet, I remember when we had to launch each probe individually and custom probe formations weren't saved.
---
Atrons are better.
---
I joked about this in another thread, but my joke just feels more and more possible the more Hilmar talks..
---
It almost seems like Hilmar got this great offer from PA to do something else, but PA wont let him take the offer while EvE is still alive because they need a driver at the wheel. 
---
But Hilmar cant just kill a product that PA just bought, so he has to make it discrete so no one notices. So he comes up with this cover story about "Chaos", blah blah and starts forcing changes that he has thought up to purposely drive players away, all the while telling his bosses, "look, look, 'numbers' are up!"
---
I'm fully aware that this is massive fucking tinfoil hat levels, but anyone else have another explanation? Other than Hilmar is fucking retarded and has no idea really what he's doing?
---
Context?
---
Both sides should spawn right away.  I agree 100%
---
It is a good analyses.
---
Why? you have the ability to pvp with wormholers already, or is it too difficult without the n+1 and capital crutch?
---
Ultimately the problem is that CCP set this ultimate goal for players to get a titan. Now that many players have been working towards them for years, you can't move the bar or make titans/supers useless. CCP needs to come up with ways for subcaps to be useful, not for caps/supers to be less useful. Something along the lines of removing entosis capability for caps. (obviously that's just an example but it should give you the general idea).
---
I never said the bots being banned was the entire sole reason for the PCU being what it is. I said that PCU *fell as a result* of the bans. Not that the bans *caused* the drop. The cause of the drop is multifactoral.
---
22,000 is a LOT of accounts getting banned. I don't know how many current subscriptions EVE Online has, but I remember one time there was 300,000 accounts. 22,000 is almost 10% of that, although that number is a few years old.
---
How many people do you think have stopped logging in because Local was removed from NullSec? Remember, CCP has said more than once that most characters spend most of their time in HiSec and would presumably not be affected by Blackout.
---
That's true, but less time spent farming and waiting for sigs to spawn is less time being vulnerable. Maybe null should have drastically reduced respawn times and drastically increased yield per site/ore too.
---
Why are you spending time in a forum of a videogame you don't enjoy playing?
---
Nerve the titans.
---
Make it where damage percentage of killmail results in percentage of bounties.
---
Just look.  Ya'll made that man unhappy.* Are you proud of yourselves now?  
---
That is the face of a man who needs to spend a month on the ocean, to climb a mountain and be reforged by a planet indifferent to mankind and its trivial concerns.
---
^^^^^^*I ^^^^^^helped
---
Keep playing eve online.
---
I suddenly realize that I could be playing Eve with people that were not born yet when I started playing Eve.
---
Mind. Blown.
---
I did. Can't play games while in the carpool or while on the shitter though, so here to see if CCP ever pulls their heads out of their collective Hilmar sized ass. 
---
I personally don't mind black out. The thing that broke EVE for me was the cyno changes and Drifter fleets. I forgave them on the Drifter fleets because they did away with them, so I came back. I left indefinitely the second they announced cyno changes.
---
Here to see if CCP ever pulls their heads out of their collective Hilmar sized ass. 
---
Boom ?
---
You forgot "stop giving this company money" was an option.
---
You don't get jail time for that, just a slap on the wrist.
---
not to mention that rigs cost way more than the structure itself and those go poof when you unanchor
---
gimme a place to type in a citadel name/id even and done
---
Based on Hilmar's latest interview, after years of ignoring that recommendation they are finally going to do that but they are acting like it was their idea all along to do that and they weren't doing it because they feared a backlash from the players for "favortism"
---
dunno if you can call those folks wormhole corps lmao
---
I'm not refuting that fact. Just making sure you knew.  
---
But also, any random connection can open at any point in to you. So there is no full way of locking your system off 100%.
---
Just post URLs already, you pussy.
---
Funny part is, I want something to entertain  me until classic.  EVE just isn't it anymore, due to 5 years of terrible decisions topped off by random poorly thought out bandaids.
---
Thanks very very much! 
---
Also thank very much for your thoughtful comments.  It’s always nice to feel that your not totally alone in your options on r/eve.  :-)
---
I actually just finished a more detailed one.

[Maths are done](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cunut8/quick_comparison_of_july_and_april_mer/?)
---
The sad part is they will never change injectors and basically said as much, because they still care about whale income over the health of the game.  This mentality mixed with throwing bandaids at the game's problem means they're never actually going to fix the game, and I think people are realizing that after this last string of retardation.  
---
Unless CCP's attitude changes drastically, the game is in serious trouble.
---
Wait, let me call Robespierre.
---
But i want to PEN my officer prop mod
---
The problem is that you can't fix the game's current issues (that CCP created and the playerbase WARNED THEM ABOUT REPEATEDLY) by pulling bandaids out of your ass.  The random shit they're throwing at the wall cause as many problems as they fix, but they don't care enough to actually do well thought out changes, because that actually takes dev time.
---
Oh my god, please no more.

Was afraid this would happen once they ran out of other projects to piss into the wind.

---
Old, but gold. This is where the Kestrel joke is comming from.
---
1) subscriptions =/= accounts, alpha accounts make up a large number of bots so banning them does nothing to sub numbers, and does not harm to the company
---
2) like I already pointed out, the bans happened more than a month prior to the player count taking its first steep drop, so regardless of whether you want to use the word "caused" or "result of" in relation to the drop both in this case are incorrect, the two events are unrelated.
---
3) we know exactly what the drop was caused by, The initial drop was paired with the release of the Trig invasion, it was accelerated with the announcement and implementation of blackout, and is continuing to accelerate now with the announcement of the cyno changes and trig npcs hunting players in highsec. Those are your 4 factors.
---
4)   "but I remember one time there was 300,000 accounts "  
---
[https://tagn.wordpress.com/2018/08/27/how-many-people-play-eve-online/](https://tagn.wordpress.com/2018/08/27/how-many-people-play-eve-online/)  
---
" *EVE Online* is also on that chart and it peaks at 500K worldwide some time at the end of 2012, "  
---
And that's 7 years ago, at a rate of up to 20,000 new accounts a month that number is probably closer to double or even triple that 500,000 at this point, making 22,000 accounts banned seem pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things.
---
5)  " Remember, CCP has said more than once that most characters spend most of  their time in HiSec and would presumably not be affected by Blackout. " 
---
Remember CCP just set the trigs lose on Highsec, resulting in several immediate complaints because they have frequently invaded systems involving the starting mission arcs.

Large numbers of subs can be bombed into oblivion by a well executed smaller group of players, we have a hard counter to turboblob fleets. If one good bombing run gets through out of 50 an entire sub fleet can be deleted. I cannot, however, delete an entire super fleet with any upshipping or amount of isk without either matching them or tripling their numbers in dreads.
---
I had it as my desktop wallpaper on my 15” 720 display when I started in 2008
---
Esp in such an old game with so many issues, a lot of people are looking for a good excuse to cut their losses and quit.  Once they finally are driven to do so, most won't come back.
---
Anime.
---
Biomass yourself.
---
and half of them are probably highsec bots.
---
Why put limits on the amount of love we want to share?
---
I agree with you. I had 13 accounts, 3 titans, 2 fax alts, and a super. Most of the alts were a mix of cyno alts, skill farmers, gankers, scouts, etc. Been playing for 10 years, sold everything and left null, since ccp is intent on just screwing us. All my accounts are shut down but one and its plexed for a bit, and I've got enough isk/plex to run for a long time. I see little reason to with each step CCP makes to give them any money or time. The same goes for my wife and her 5 accounts. They are just intent on driving away long term players for 'reasons'..
---
How'd they get my fuel?!
---
Galentte drones arent "better". Each factions drone just have different strengths. Galentte drones are slow but hard, minmatar are the fastest etc.
---
One group does thermal and the other does EM. I would say which you use depends on plenty of factors though gallente have higher raw numbers ofc
---
A single battlecruiser can pause medium structures. A battleship will easily do it, and a leshak fit fully for damage should be able to pause an azbel.
---
NEW content in many mmorpgs on the market. Wow classic, swtor expansion only as a example
---
Yes I understand but Gallente are number 1 when it comes to drones is what I heard because they and amarr get bonuses. Can you tell me what amarr drones get etc?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmUAJYh1-0w
---
Group your guns omg
---
 FF XIV's latest expansion is still fresh, I've been playing a lot of that lately.
---
did you consider suicide? it's an open option
---
Gallente drones used to be quite a bit better, but CCP changed them at some point.
---
So like dude said, Minnie is fastest, gallente track best, amarr have the most tank, and caldati have the most range. (This is all IIRC, btw).
---
They still do racial damage type, so realistically, pick whatever damage type you need, or when it comes to lights, I use warriors because they have the best chance of not getting kited.
---
Still got my 2
---
Im new can you explain what you mean by using warriors and kiting also are all factions individual drones at equal level if ccp has changed things?
---
I also recommend manure paste.
---
I mean, maybe they don't want people to easily be able to roll holes?  Maybe wormholers should have to put up with whatever shitty system they are randomly connected to for the duration of the hole?  Idk.
---
My insurance carrier doesn't cover self-inflicted cancer, I must decline.
---
I read reddit during the blackout and cyno changes and contracted it
---
Lmao I have never heard of it as a game. What a shitty game leh sigh. Had my cpa for 3 years and I’ve made a horrible mistake. 
---
Though it is hard to say which one they pref over the other. It depends on the business plex makes more per transaction, but the consistent money will be sub. 
---
I agree with you.
---
Amarr have a solid balance of all attributes. They are quick and do good damage.
---
Just look at attributes for a class in each race, becomes very clear how they were balanced.
---
Off-topic aside:
---
You made me think of "The Replacement Killers", which until just now I thought Mira Sorvino's character's name was "Makeover".
---
I just discovered it is actually "Meg Coburn".  Maybe I got the 'joke' without even realizing it was a joke?
---
Yet they rarely happen  no matter how common titans have become.

amaar  drones at its basic do emp dmg wich mainly work good  on shields since armor tanked ships in general are natural  greatly tanked against  emp , does makes it niche to use.  
---
while gallente drones are in the thermal  dmg. wich everyone has tank  but most the  time not as high, for that it works fine on shields and armor if not tanked specific  against it. 
---
and there is also the diffrence in tracking and firerate.
---
that sayed it is also depended on the regional  rats  in pve .
---
Sansah: amaar drones naturaly are the best against .
---
Rouge drones: in general dont like EM DMG so amaar. 
---
bloodraiders : 50/50 since the  tank is split  into thermal/em amaar and gallente working fine.  
---
   
---
for the others the dmg application does not well.  
---
ofc you can kill everything  with amaar drones but it will take longer in most regions outside of amaar or the drone regions.
---
Hey all, It's been a while since I made a video and I really wanted to get a refresher on my editing skills so here's my POV of the EQWO-Y Fight. This is my first time using royalty free music so please let me know what you think!
---
Can someone present a correct and widely accepted explanation on how a Nos works on an NPC? I have heard that it doesn't work, works on some npcs and not others, works for a short time,etc with reviews of old forums having this debate for years. I understand it's probably not very useful as an energy source, but is it possible? Ticket to GM was replied with a recommendation not to do it and that they couldn't say or tell me anything else.
---
There won't be a need to rage roll. Just scan the next wh in the chain. You won't have to worry about it collapsing prematurely now, allowing you to actually roam a bit.
---
Ewar pilot here. Please no.
---
Sounds like you are scared of folks counter forming, which keeps you from easy kills against Krabs.

It's a panel from a pornographic manga widely considered to be some of the most disturbing shit to come out of a country known for its disturbing pornography. The comics name is Metamorphosis or Emergence and can be found relatively easily. My suggestion is don't....

---
&gt;alpha accounts make up a large number of bots
---
Speculation.
---
&gt;like I already pointed out, the bans happened more than a month prior to the player count taking its first steep drop
---
Check PCU, it's been dropping all year. And what a surprise - 22,000 accounts being banned also happened during that time. Again retard, I never said 22,000 accounts being banned was the entire cause of the PCU drop. But if you don't think 22,000 accounts which probably have more "up" time than the average player being banned isn't a factor in the PCU dropping, then you're truly a goontard.
---
&gt;we know exactly what the drop was caused by, The initial drop was paired with the release of the Trig invasion, it was accelerated with the announcement and implementation of blackout, and is continuing to accelerate now with the announcement of the cyno changes and trig npcs hunting players in highsec. Those are your 4 factors.
---
Considering how long PCU has been dropping (years), **probably not**.
---
&gt;And that's 7 years ago, at a rate of up to 20,000 new accounts a month that number is probably closer to double or even triple that 500,000 at this point, making 22,000 accounts banned seem pretty insignificant in the grand scheme of things.
---
I mean if you think like 5% of accounts banned is trivial, especially when bots probably have a lot of up time... then sure.
---
Yeah I fly a ton of ewar too. I feel for you, just throw some whore guns on top.
---

Being unable to roll holes would mean you are stuck with whatever holes you get, which wouldn't be a problem if more people lived in jspace. The thing is, wormholes are mostly empty, so when hunting, people usually roll empty holes away untill some activity comes up. 
---
If you make it so that rolling holes is harder (or impossible), you need to add a way to make wormhole space "faster" to navigate. Having to scan down long chains untill you find one system with activity would just be inconvenient, not a driver to conflict. 
---
I'd change the way new signatures work, having them open as soon as they spawn, instead of having a 4 hour window of safety. That'd make it harder to close off holes, while still alowing control to get rid of dead chains. Maybe add kind of "hub" systems with lots of jspace statics (shattered holes, maybe?) that would connect lots of chains together, kind of like Thera. 
---
With those two changes, you kill the hability to close systems off, and give people places to find each other.
---
Really two of the only things that would be needed to reign in super carriers is to remove the 2 light/support tubes from them and delete burst projectors.  Right now a super can field a full flight of long range fighters a group of dromis and sirens and a target painting burst projector.  It doesn't need support if you're dropping it on a small group because it has all of it's own utility with 0 sacrifices made.
---
I don't fly titans so I wouldn't even know where to begin with them but that's just a spitball idea for reigning back in super carriers.

This is not correct.

Amarr: Best tracking. 3rd highest damage. 2nd fastest.
---
Caldari: Best Tank. 2nd Highest Damage. 2nd Slowest
---
Gallente: Best Damage. terrible tracking. Slowest.
---
Minmatar: Worst damage, fastest drones, worst tank.
---
I'm sorry what? How does anything i said suggest that? I have no interest in hunting ships that can't reasonably fight back and wasting hours of my life rage rolling into empty holes hoping to find some ratters.
---
They don't, in their chome chains. 
---
Tonnes of farm homes. For sure.
---
Sounds like it must apply to you if it causes some butthurt. :)
---
Even a broken clock is right twice a day
---
Or just make it so it applies to a corporation that’s claimable on structures.  So any structure killed can claim it.  You’d have to ratio this though between structure worth etc
---
"This is my hole" gone horribly wrong, eh?
---
Fucking yikes.
---
I, for one, look forward to every eviction being as Chaotic as Dropbears.
---
Right. So if someone is trying to kill you with drones, one way you mitigate drone damage is by outrunning the drones. If you're ship is faster than the drones, they just chase you around never getting close enough to hit.  That's kiting the drones.
---
Since warriors are the fastest drones, there are fewer ships fast enough to kite them.  I honestly don't think I've had a set of warrior 2s ever get kited, but my skills are pretty much maxed out.
---
The individual drones are equal, but different, if that makes sense.  For example if I'm flying a Gila, I use acolytes a lot, because the Gila gets a drone hit point bonus, and the Amarr drones have the most hit points, so those attributes stack, and my drones survive longer when people try to smart bomb them.
---
You gotta think about damage type too.  When I'm hunting ratters in Delve or Stain (where the rats do EM damage), I use Minmatar drones because the armor tanked ratting ships have explosive holes.  If you're in guristas space, use Amarr drones.
---
Actually, the more I'm thinking about it, I really only use Amarr and Minmatar drones, except for sentries, where I use caldati and gallente.  gallente drones are just too slow, and I don't really want to do kinetic damage very often.
---
That's not what that means at all no matter how much you cry and flail about it.
---
Haha I could feel the pain as you searched for mid range ammo. Sweet video, keep them coming.
---
I would love to see Titans rebuilt into area control ships, capable of creating massive -- possibly grid-sized -- slowing, damaging, tracking, warp, or target interference zones.
---
But this effect does not stack: A single titan can perform it just as well as 20 titans. At the same time, it will make your opponent shit their pants as it affects their entire fleet and can be incredibly debilitating depending on doctrine and placement decisions made by both parties.
---
They are definitely hard to find! I usually have to force them by pissing someone off. Like yesterday I MJDed onto a Wolf and two shorted him cause he thought he was safe at 100km. Moments later he busted out his Myrmidon and I got a sweet 1v1. This Brutix was just chilling in a Large and for once it wasn't bait, was a great fight. Got super lucky!

---
It's 500 times the amount of ISK one PLEX is.
---
I'm 90% sure Amarr drones have more total HP. Caldati has more armor then Amarr has shield, but Amarr has more structure, and more armor then caldati has shield.
---
IDK though. You might be right. I really only use warriors, valks and infiltrators anyway.
---
Is scanning 43 wormholes in a rolling ship content?

Sounds like cancer.

Are you retarded? And do you know what a strawman is?
---
&gt;  A day 1 char can tackle ships for a fleet and secure kills for experienced players
---
That used to be the case. Nowadays, that newbie will be blapped away by drones, because CCP went against this philosophy (unwittingly, more than likely) for years, and the balancing changes they did destroyed this. EVE used to be that great game where a newbie could fly circles around a battleship, and neither would be able to kill the other. You'd need support, friends, and a whole array of ships to face your opponent. 
---
Now? your battleship is tackled by a newbie? nothing a flight of hobos can't fix in a few seconds. Applicability issues? what's that? I have haws on my dread, why shouldn't I be able to kill cruisers with it?
---
Only if you've killed them. Suitonia did a great video on how to get blue with sanshas miners and then killed ships using diamond sansha rats in null sec. That's what I mean. Can't run missions for trigs. If you could I would do them lol.
---
Like 2B.
---
https://evemarket.brianum.de/type/44992-PLEX   or about 1.75bil (if maths are right).
---
A leshak can pause large structures with no damage mods at all, you only need 1500 dps to pause. 2 polarized hecates works well too.
---
A Letter, to CCP, with Love...
---
... well, lots of perfume, at least.
---
Yeah and just think of those stuck in a High-sec corp being told a similar story just with Mining/Missioning/Incursions and all of that jazz instead.
---
The thing is, you only find out about this once you've been part of the community for a while. I mean, by the time I heard about those, I was already living in lowsec, crashing into anything that couldn't run from a hurricane, and I'm sure my case is not far from the norm.

Solid shout-out to the 5 TAPI titans that can't land a boosh on a fleet on a gate! GF had fun!

---
Ok I have the feeling that you know alot and wont judge my newbie questions,I wanna know which faction you the best is and your reason for it (ship wise and drone wise) also whoch faction has the most players and which has the least?
---
Id like to either have minmatar or amarr maybe even gallente as a last dotch but never caldari.
---
Yeah, that'd be a summer of rage 2.0 shit.
---
Just carry blue loot on your hold and get farmed.

Thanks for the gold award, very kind!  Let's hope logic can eventually prevail and bring balance without pushing long skill train careers out the door.

It makes him feel uncomfortable. Come on, don't you know, we have to accomodate his feefees.
---
&gt;Again retard, I never said 22,000 accounts being banned was the entire cause of the PCU drop. But if you don't think 22,000 accounts which probably have more "up" time than the average player being banned isn't a factor in the PCU dropping, then you're truly a goontard.
---
If you are so stupid that you think a ban in MAY resulted in a player count that was not seen until after July first, you are the retard.  
---
" I mean if you think like 5% of accounts banned is trivial, especially when bots probably have a lot of up time... then sure. "
---
2 x 500,000 = 1,000,000, 1,000,000/22,000 = 2% Can't you even fucking math correctly?
---

lol
---
I was pretty happy to see -A- when I looked up the characters.
---
Sure, but this (and the blackout to a sense), are mostly pointless changes no?
---
They dont really address the problems that plague either space. 
---
Blackout forced the few non-bots that werent already under umbrellas, under umbrellas. 
---
No rolling would mean less incentive for WHers to rat with caps, and just encourages more Mjd Ballteship/citadel ratting.

I know it doesn't seem like it's coming any time soon, but maybe they will realize where they've overreached and bring about balance without excluding styles of play - especially ones that require so much SP.

The average age of eve players is pushing 40. They aren't kids sitting in school. This is dumb.
---
That's tough. If you're interested in drones, then gallente and Amarr ships are the place to start.  I actually really like the Amarr drone ships (dragoon, arbutrator, prophecy and Armageddon), but your milage may vary.  I think the gallente ships probably get better drone bonuses, but the Amarr ships are easier to fit, and probably have a little more tank.
---
I would just train whatever looks coolest to you for now though. Eventually you'll end up training into all four races, but whatever you train first, you'll spent a lot of time looking at it and flying it around. It helps to not hate looking at it.
---
Also, whatever race/weapons type/tank type you start with, make sure you stick with it until you get the skills to mostly level 4.  It's more fun to have decent skills in one ship then to have half ass skills in like 3 ships.
---
pls post your cartoons somewhere else

That's great!

Quick BR: we were looking at 0-o crabbing titans for a while now. TEST switched from VNIs straight to Titans and we were looking at finding a way to get them. 
---
O-o is within direct jump from main staging and TEST armor Titan fleet. Essentially it’s undock and jump for them. There is also JB in system which makes it simple for them to get tackle in. We assumed dreads would die under pretty much any reasonable TEST response. 
---
Stain’s role was eyes, getting TEST comfortable with our Sabres and Flycatchers sitting in system “just because”, opening cyno and initial tackle. 
---
Goons were “surprise sex” part of the deal. Without Goons we could kill Hel or Nyx but never a titan. Even crab fit one. 
---
Avatar did his usual Heaven crabbing. We waited till he used Boson - I opened cyno on Rapier ( getting used to new mechanics :) and our hero Sabre logged in system put bubbles up. Cyno Rapier lived, no idea how cause we jumped without Fax. 
---
Stain dreads jumped in first cause they could hear me. Followed by Pittsburgh and his fleet. 
---
We screwed up Sabre fleet with bridge but we had 3 different tackle options so titan was not going anywhere. It was my screw up. Sorry Goon tackle fleet, sometimes shit happens. 
---
Avatar died with a whimper. 
---
Jammer was already online so TEST could not get there in time. All Goon dreads simply jumped out. 5 unlucky Stain dreads could not jump due to fatigue ( we were much farther away ) and we could not warp out in time. Tenashi my dread was jumping in last since I was cyno, bridge and tackle. 
---
Hero goon carriers stayed till last moments to get a few of our dreads and Rorqual out.
---

People want a little bit of danger and sense that you don't know what's there (well most do). The thought of being completely alone with thousands of systems, a shitty story/mission line, and no real game story is kind of boring though. Like why login to a mmo if you legit don't know there is a single other person playing. 
---
No local is kind of that border line a lot seem to have drawn. Zkill was a bit far (we have grown accustom to having isk value for actions which you can brag about). Removal of ingame map data would be even further... you basically would only be able to fly around checking citadels and stations to even see if anyone else was doing anything/ logged in. That would suck.
---

So you're afraid of getting rolled in, so you dont bring a fleet? Sounds like you only want PVP on your terms! 
---
I guess you where the kettle calling the pot black!
---
Heat just reduces the duration. I dont see why you have to worry to enough about changing damage types in a 1v1 to justify heating.
---
&gt; Even if someone is looking for the k162 when your static rolls over they have to still notice it's there, scan it, look through, call for people to kill ratters, and then the people to kill even if they are organized have to warp to the hole.
---
Where was the patch notes or dev log about the drifter attacks?
---
Mmm leaning towards amarr then and what did you start with if i may ask?
---
also is sisters of eve galente?
---
&gt;I want to see change that let's me assault wormholes
---
You already can.
---
A bomber can solo small structures.
---
Drones got rebalanced few years back and Gallente drones aren't the be-all end-all pick anymore. Most people who still use Gallente drones are probably just operating on inertia, or don't know the rebalance happened at all.
---
EVE Uni has good comparison of all the drones: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Drones#Light.2C_medium_and_heavy_drones
---
Personally I think Caldari/Amarr drones are best. Not only do they have 25% more HP than Gallente/Minmatar drones, most of that HP is actually in shield/armor - which actually have resistances(and in case of Caldari drones, shields also regen) Drones were never updated with the base structure resists, so Gallente drones are very fragile. Not worth an 8% increase in DPS.
---
So, if you are soloing t1s I'd reccomend &lt;150 dps, but it's still cutting it a bit close, so an extra few dps should do it
---
I think they're still salty

rumor is they are making some adjustments to JF's to ease the burden of the cyno changes.

Absolutely. I am. Do not worry though, you are within direct jump from D-P. What could go wrong?
---
Who chirps in local?  I scan as many green bars as I can while cloaked, move into position to dscan the rest from one place if possible.  Then I throw combat probes.  Next I go check all the structures.  I make myself visible, and my intentions couldnt be more clear.  There are simply less people in these places.  
---
I have solo burned athanors to 95% 1 jump away from Capitol systems then put some friends on the goo when no response came.  Granted it was their weakest tz, but a cpl weeks ago I would've gotten, at least, a single pilot to dock/login and take control of the station.
---
Can I have your stuff?

I mean it's all good memes. Titan got SRP'ed.

I created my account in 2005. It's almost 2020. Yeah I feel you there.   
---
Wow is still around from those days but it's total trash while Eve is still completely unique. Impressive and disturbing, no one's come close to recreating it in all this time.
---
I'd argue not even then.  95% of what CCP releases is broken and doesn't work how its supposed to for months (years?) anyway.
---
&gt;people to easily be able to roll holes
---
Why? 
---
I mean rolling holes itself isnt easy and content creators are absolutely valued over any other corp mate. 
---
Someone who scans religiously is an asset by itself. 
---
It also completely stagnates j space. You'd be resorting to planting an alt in every system just to watch for new signs to pop up if your chain is ass. 
---
Bears are safer, less stuff destroyed, and less fun overall.
---
That'd be nice, if there was more people living in WHspace. Right now most systems are empty. 
---
If this kind of change goes trough, they need to have some sort of "hub" system with a lot of conections. They kind of happen nowadays, by chance, and a lot of the fighting ends up happening there. 
---
I'd just make it so shattered wormholes have 6 static connections or something like that. Increase chain complexity, and that'll make it easier to find others without rolling every shit hole you get.
---
Obligatory "can I have your stuff?"
---
It's fine for flying around in high sec in a worthless ship. Back in the day there was no "warp to zero" or "jump/dock" options. You always arrived at 15k.    
---
Now we have the 2 options, afk travel and probably die, or pay attention and be able to escape. This beats the shit out of the old system.
---
to me its scary how little he understands about the game.

It's almost as if the eastern beast propaganda isn't true after all.

Yeah, my first account was created on 2006. Didn't really start playing untill 2009, but still...

That’s not “the current meta” that’s how Eve has always been. You’re always better off with more and stronger allies, that was as true in 2003 as it is today.

Tell us what you are doing drones are just ammo you use them for different things
---
You really are simple.
---
here's math. Delve has thousands of accounts farming/mining/ratting. WH's have like 100.
---
Interesting graphs. It is really interesting to see people moving towards mining. I agree that it is easier to protect groups of miners when compared to ratters. In my opinion, there should be an incentive to rat with a fleet incursion style, rather than solo. That way, instead of people coming to gank ratters, they need to bring a fleet and have a good fight for their kills. This would be more fun for everyone imo.
---
&gt; So on top of this you have materials for whole T3 production and other stuff like null relics spawning in the WH space.
---
I know it's you, and I should not take your shitposting seriously... but this is not a "faucet", you dense mother fucker.
---
But muh blue doughnut!
---
This is just sad. I took a new player out tonight and just ran some combat sites in high sec he took away like 5million in loot in about 1.5 hours and was pretty happy. It’s sad that these bitters have to ruin the game like this and make it tough for a new player to afford to play

The beauty of this is that it the structure can be owned by an unaffiliated third party. The structure owner is completely unaware, other than a massive bounty being placed.

Feroxes will win fights - they're cheap, they're disposable, and anyone can fly them. But they feed hard.

&gt; It kills faith in the devs' vision.  At this point, I'd argue they don't even HAVE a  real vision, so why would I want to play the long game?
---
I've put my caps in mothballs. Subcaps have been taken out. I'm going to wait until CCP gets their "Change now, balance later" out of their system first before I make any decisions.
---
but the isk bounties are not enough
---
I see there is war in winterco space, goons returned to delve, Panfam moved places.
---
Yo but wtf happened in gotB space for such dramatic fall?
---
So not illegal everywhere.
---
Gallente aren't number-one when it comes to _drones_. 
---
It's better to think about it as; 
---
&gt; Gallente are number-one in terms of drone bonused ships. 
---
Even then, Amarr, Guristas, and SOE have solid drone bonused ships too.
---
can you explain Sister of eve to me please
---
I could legit confuse a Nag in a bubble for a POS. No joke.
---
I actually like that idea of a cooldown if you die in a certain ship. Got blapped in your doctrine DPS ship? No more just reshipping and back to the battlefield. FPS games have respawn timers so it would work something like that. Give the other team a temporary advantage.
---
If only there was a way to covertly insert as many ships as you want into a system that doesn't require a gate and all those ships could warp cloaked do they don't show up on Dscan and some of them have a one second delay on decloak and lock.
---
Imagine playing Halo 3 CTF where you respawn immediately after getting killed. 
---
Or playing CS:GO and being able to respawn in the same round. IS that fair? 
---
That is the angle they are getting at. If you die in a Muninn, you can't just go back into a Muninn and re-enter the fight immediately. Maybe a 30 min to 1-hour cooldown until you can get back into one.
---
It would prevent super numbers from being the end all be all determiner in winning an objective. Sure put them in subs and f1 — it’s always possible to match subcap numbers
---
I agree with you but that is the same system that was removed so then injectors needed to be added. It made perfect sense. Keep your 100mill SP but brand newbro isn't permanently 2 years behind you.
---
Started with anomaly respawn time increase and escalation drop nerf, spawned OP Drifters roaming around nullsec killing everything, then turned off local chat and now annouced cyno nerf.
---
Changes might be good, but short term CCP made a huge crysis sinking significant portion of player base.
---
They are talking about nerfing/removing asset safty. This game is changing to the point where you cant take break without lose.
---
Wormhole mechanics that are properly explained in the patch note discussions and people don’t understand how they work like 10 years later
---
Damn you’re actually an ignorant fuck and have never been to c5 space. You’ll fit right in here on reddit
---
&gt;c3 and c4 jokes are highly populated

I stopped reading here

Well if you are playing in amarr space with Sansha npcs you use acolytes amarr drones. That is the answer you are looking for

Other MMOs a year is end game, able to do whatever you want. Eve it’s like - cool I can fly a single races battleship well

---
You’ve never actually lived in wormholes if you think our mindset is “how can we defend this hole”. That’s literally the last thing we think about absent seeing an eviction fleet in chain. 99% of pvp groups rolling is done to search for content — people live in c5s exclusively to be able to rage roll. It’s sad to see a null bear type 3 paragraphs about what he *thinks* life in wormhole space is like and how we operate. The sooner you accept that you’re just ignorant about wormholes the easier it will be on your spodbrain. At this point I’m just copy pasting replies — the extent of null ignorance is fascinating nonetheless.
---
Ratting down
---
Mining up.
---
I'm fine losing a barge but not a ratting super that makes the same amount of isk/hr as moon mining with a barge.
---
shut up and lie to me so i dont have to read it
---
Perhaps not everyone knows, or not everyone is prepared for end game commitment. Instead they want to change it to suit their needs. Perhaps people don't feel confident without 1000 buddies holding each others Willie's for PVP.
---
So, bot bans happen in waves (like we saw with iron crown today). They do it this way, because catching bots is pretty nuanced and they a) need to be sure, and b) see what other tells the application has. 
---
Then, once they identify a bot and “fingerprint” the software used - they ban all users at once. This has the upside of slowing down bot creating (because bot developers aren’t sure exactly what tripped off CCP), and allowing their reach to go beyond bots and see what accounts they interact with on a regular basis to catch the muels / handlers / mains, too. 
---
It’s pretty standard across game development.
---
https://evemarketer.com/
---
They moved to highsec to do industry?
---
Can't imagine they were of much use before that.
---
Npc caps are considered 100% full all the time.  Nos functions like a load balance where you impart a set load onto their capacitor and you get a bump in your cap intake.  The issue with nos is it's diminishing gains when the cap is not under load.  Which is why you typically won't see them used on hulls that don't bonus them.   A neut will remove cap entirely from the equation, using your cap to make that happen, conversely.
---
So, what this basically means, a nos is always best when your cap is low, or consistently lower than your opponent  or it will have no impact on the opposing cap.  
---
Why this isn't widely used in pve is consistent performance is worth more than inconsistent benefits.  Not only are you rarely going to be in a situation where sucking off an opponent is going to be a net benefit to just vaporizing him. Because the modules aren't giving consistent output, you shouldn't rely on them for things like tank, or damage application.
---
The adage: cap is life; holds true here.  This is why the age of the cap booster is upon us, and will be until the next meta comes along.  Before this it was permarun fits.
---
The login things could also be just to get poeple to stick it out instead of being super reactionary.
---
Many people complain before actually seeing how the changes affect the world. They just immediately jump to doomsaying and then most of the time the changes don't actually change a whole lot.
---
How to not get rolled in while taking a fight,
---
Scout with scanner, check hole type and maximum mass so you don't do a razer and turboblob yourselves in.
---
Enter hole, keep bubble on hole at all times. bonus points for frigate with web and some light dps 
---
Don't jump the scanner out until fleet has extracted.
---
Fear of being rolled in as a reason to not fight, is some pretty major mental Olympics, its also a risk wormholers take whenever they go roaming or whaling, as closing the hole is a common defence tactic of some groups.
---
Alternatively ping aggressively for 10 minutes or more and jump your 50 man hac fleet in, then proceed do your best wingspan impression and don't ever leave more than 5km of the hole, because that might mean risking something while shit posting in local about why the 10 roamers won't feed to you and circlejerking each other off in comms.
---
&gt; all weebs are oversensitive loser manchildren
---
What else is new?
---
Deflation is never good. IT means your economy is loosing value. You also don't want rampant inflation, that means the economy isn't keeping up with production and/or demand.
---
They have mentioned this stuff.
---
I think a big part is that the code for that data in game is likely harder to just "switch off" compared to local.
---
Abyssal sites are actually perfect for this. Especially low tiers, they’re soloable I’m almost any shit fit, so experienced players don’t really lose anything in 1-2s, and can be accessed in frigates only.
---
&gt;  somewhat balanced out by local alerting them to threats.
---
More like totally overshadowed by.
---
You are exactly the kind of person who shouldn't be able to own a titan. A titan SHOULD only be the tool of neckbeard NEETs who play every day for 12hours+. The fact that they aren't is 100% of the problem with them at this time.
---
But you can't cyno cloaked. So you'd be on dscan.
---
So, the average player is loosing money and null-sec empire turbo crabs are safe?
---
Cyno more than 15 AU away. You have all the time in the world to make a inter-celestial safe that's more than 15AU away from celestials and where anoms spawn.
---
Possibly calculate how long you have been activating an offensive module on a structure...
---
I guess this explains why RR seemed to fizzle out in Branch when I was cloaky camping :)
---
The real beauty is that someone else can war dec the same structure and steal the kill.
---
A bling as fuck bomber can do it too with max skills
---
No longer having to scrape every penny and turn every cheek to keep the big boring blue doughnut happy. Pearl is letting run the game like they want to instead of have to.
---
Why did he get srped?
---
Those are truly the best of days, win or lose.
---
&gt; Wormholers will now have to actually defend their space instead of just docking up and rolling the dangerous WH to win any engagement as is the current favourite tactic of WH
---
what version of eve are you playing? srsly... i lived in wormholes for the past 6years now... not a SINGLE time did ANY null group try to fight us in our hole. they bridged 80man ferox fleets directly on our hole. fleets that could have completely obliterated our heavy armor ships sitting on the inside.
---
should i tell you what they did? the jumped 50ferox in, reapproached and jumped out. hole is verge... thats the only time a fleet actually came into our hole.
---
Its ne nullbears spamming sigils as soon as they find your hole and you have to keep a sabre/hic on the outside to keep your hole open. there is a reason why a fuckton of sigils of nullcorporatios die inside wormholes.. so im sorry to say, but whatever eve version you are playing. its the other way around in the ''real'' one.
---
True and now in the age of the rorq it’s an awful idea to not at least start off under the wing of a big bloc if you want a real presence in null

You're here aren't you?
---
Can someone help me? I’m flying a harbinger. Can i participate with the Trig invasion or deep abyssal?
---
Are laserboats any good at all for Trig or low/null sec rats?
---
You should take into consideration what you're using your drones for and what you're up against.
---
Eg. you're flying a tormentor and have a very limited drone bay, caldari navy hornets are by far the best default drones because minmatar/missile boats are going to be using explosive/kinetic against you, and thanks to their massive shield buffer with high exp/ki resistance, one navy hornet is nearly 2.5x warrior IIs in EHP.
---
If its strategic, going counterclockwise around the universe from Deklein to Catch is blue except for some pockets of resistance and pet alliances.
---
You know this. Everyone knows this. Don't be a retard. Everyone loves titan kills.
---
Curse &gt; Any gallente drone boat.

Why wouldn’t he?

someone just go all MBC and put bounties on all goon structures

So much text for so little information.

There has always been a group of people certain that Eve is dying. /r/eve is where those people congregate right now.
---
People have been claiming Eve is dying since 2003. It's still here. Don't let the bittervets get to you and enjoy the game in peace.Eve is great, and if you get into it you'll have lots of fun.
---
&gt;I want to play, but fear it would be a waste of time if the player base is declining.
---
make your own judgement.
---
https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility
---
that website shows how many players were logged in at any given moment in time over the last 15 years or so.
---
What's the deal? Besides the skill points. I didn't get an email, there's a discount on a month of eve?
---
No, now they despawn and respawn if nobody runs them.
---
You will learn quickly to ignore most of the crap in this sub.
---
Fake news code only stays in high sec
---
what you see on here is not the whole picture. often people come here to complain and make dense arguments. there is alot of good things here as well. like art and other things of the like. pretty much take anything you see with a grain of salt.
---
1) you can rebind scan size from mouse wheel+alt.    
---
    
---
2) get a new mouse? They aren't exactly pricey.    
---
Double click works fine. No lag here on scanning. And I use integrated video (ryzen 2200g). There are also buttons to change scanning angle from top or side.    
---
Not really seeing anything wrong except that your mouse is fucked up?
---
"Its litterally all of nullsec and lowsec." Yeah but they are all blue to each other so who is he going to fight? :D
---
That and I think that CCP should keep their hands off the asset systems, as it forces people to play if they want to keep their stuff. All cool but then there is no reason for many players to be in null for example, leading to a content drought.
---
pot meet kettle
---
Was in comms w the guy, sad asf hearing 
---
"59% armor"
---
"22%"
---
"6%"
---
"im dead guys"
---
Which works in the world of those games because they are based on rounds. You die and then within five minutes your next match starts.
---
An MMO like EVE is not bound by these round-based mechanisms, which makes the suggested inability to fly your ship very hard to defend.
---
Eve had its ups and downs. Right now, they are making actual changes to the game. These changes are so good that i had to actually come back. Also, these changes will have little effect on a new player. 
---
As for longevity of the game, it isn't going anywhere for at least 10 more years. I say that as someone who has been around since 2005.
---
I've been searching for a Corp since returning and I found a way cool bunch. Day one and we hung out on discord voice and did group ops all evening. Small enough group that I can really get to know everyone, large enough there's always someone on to do several activities with.    ...
---
Good day in my Eve :)
---
jesus the fucking drop of bounties from cowards and bots.
---
It's a big upheaval of some fundamental game mechanics, mostly affecting older players. By the time it's done I guess everyone in the game will have been affected. Some play styles are getting much harder than they were, some might disappear, new ones might spring up. Nobody really knows what's going to happen so people are freaking out. 
---
Just to put the changes in perspective, local chat in nullsec has worked the same since 2003 and it's totally different since last month. Cynosural fields could be fit to any ship since like 2004 and next month they're being restricted to just 2 ship classes, both of which are relatively expensive tech 2 ships.
---
My personal opinion is it's the most exciting time to be playing EVE in at least 3 years. We saw our first [pipebomb](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cu8p85/mango_pipebomb_on_elo/) in *years* the other day and I can't wait to see how the metagame evolves to deal with these changes.
---
I'll take the bait:
---
Nah, it's a fine time to start playing. There are always players burnt out on the game or salty over something changing. And to be fair CCP is changing a lot about the game right now, and claims to have more in store, a bunch targeted at new players. But most of this is people whining that they have to change, and that their past activity isn't perhaps as lucrative or powerful. 
---
It's just a standard version of the complaining any time a dev does a balance pass and nerfs or buffs things, amplified some because the changes are large and Eve is a competitive game so some changes are going to affect some people/groups more than others. 
---
Just have fun in New Eden, and enjoy the spectacle of grown men and women crying over a video game. You'll still find helpful advice and answers if you ask a real question about the game, and it isn't going anywhere. In fact, starting now puts you in a better position to adapt to the new state of the sandbox than some who are too stuck in their ways to adapt.
---
Til listing personal experience in a relevant situation is r/iamverysmart material.

It's worth the same amount today as it was worth in February:

Til krabbing titans get srp'd in test, think I'll join test
---
We're all dying, just in a long time (hopefully). Don't listen to these guys cause they'll bring you down
---
&gt; Instead of encouraging people to kill the target, bounties just give random rewards to people who were probably going to kill them anyway.​
---
Ironically, the only time bounties actually matter for is haulers. Popping an empty freighter is suddenly profitable.
---
Eve has a future let it be chaos.

I didnt know u guys had a Palantine Keepstar?
---
He was logged off on safe spot. We put a POS up where we thought he’d login again and watched it.
---
I’m buying!
---
Except there will be nothing for you to smash because nobody would live there under those conditions....Oh wait I get it now! Its another parity thing right? Null sec is mostly empty so Jspace should be too right? Obviously low-sec would be next, we'll remove all the stations and assest safety, then we do the same to high sec, concord has to go too of course and we can finally achieve parity! The game will be completely empty but that's a small price to pay for balance, wouldn't you agree?
---
Noooot quite. I was making a reference to Clone High, where they have a running gag in one episode where all the clones give each other makeovers. [Like this jolly good clip right here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzvoHslX6Vo)

Ouch man (

I take a break from Eve for one week and this shit happens
---
Wooooah man ! Who would've thought people would like to spend what's left of their summer break with their family or outside, and not on EVE, thus decreasing the player population for a little while ! Amazing, you must be an Harvard student.
---
Just wait until october ffs.
---
&gt;If you are so stupid that you think a ban in MAY resulted in a player count loss that was not seen until after JULY first

This. Bounty hunting structures would be a thing, people would do it if the price was right. And if you rmt the price is usually huge
---
Hilmar god of chaos here us now this idea is great do it please
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Yeah it's pretty fair because respawn doesn't happen usually in the same system as the one you got blaped, and if it does it's fun for everyone, more content. To get back into a fight you need to travel, maybe dodge a few gatecamps, bubbles or dive some unscanned, unbookmarked wh. You would kill small skirmishes (like the ones you get in GE- and also massive brawls.
---
Any time is a good time to start playing EVE.       Just like any time is a good time to stop playing EVE.   It just depends on if you are a "Glass is half full or Glass is half empty" kind of guy.
---
I can sum it up.  
---
Certain people would rather be kings of a dying game than see the game change to keep some of the new players it's able to attract.
---
c r i n g e
---
I would love a comparaison of isk destroy by region to see how blackout really affected the game. Because if isk generation and isk destroyed decrease, it only mean blackout only bring less activity into the game..
---
Sounds like you've found a way to keep yourself busy. If you're having fun then that's awesome, that's the point of the game. But don't expect other people to care about a random Hecate. They're not going to send out a single ship and you're going to run from a response fleet so it's a waste of everyone's time. Nobody cares about a rando in a Hecate. You could try lowsec.
---
They made some changes that upset people that are used to afk killing npc ships 24/7 with 10 different accounts.
---
Basically ccp changed a chat channel mechanic and is intending to make it harder/more expensive to move big (capital and super capital) ships around and deploy them into large fights. That's all they did/are doing so far. The CCP CEO and a CCP community manager have talked about some other things but these haven't been confirmed as incoming changes as of yet.
---
The chat channel change, more specifically, is that, in null security space, you dont see a list of pilots in your local chat, like you do in highsec or lowsec. This was commonly used as an Intel tool to see where enemy pvpers are, so that non combat ships could get safe when enemy pvpers were nearby.
---
The capital change is a bit harder to explain. CCP isn't nerfing capitals directly (though that may be coming for some types of capitals), instead their being much more restrictive on what types of ships can light a cyno beacon for capital class ships to teleport to. They are limiting capital cynos to force recon cruisers and black ops battleships. Designated cyno ships will be more expensive, be less convenient, and/or have less tank (situation depending on which) than the ships currently used.
---
Both of these changes impact a large number of playstyles in null security (0.0 to -1.0 security  status) space, and the cyno change impacts lowsec as well. Most players feel that these changes make nullsec space less safe, which was the stated goal by CCP. 
---
/- But many players feel that these changes went to far and made nullsec unprofitable, to the point that a few thousand players stopped playing entirely. 
---
/- Many feel that these changes will drive players to larger groups for more safety while they make money, leading to a few rich groups monopolizing nullsec space. This is widely considered bad because... well... war is fun. 
---
/- Many players feel that the capital/cyno changes will make large battles more difficult to initiate.
---
/- Many players feel that the reduction of safety was nessisary, as nullsec has been getting extremely safe to live in while the rewards kept increasing (the philosophy being that reward should be balanced with risk to keep all profitable playstyles in a state of balance). 
---
/- Many players feel that the game is more fun now, because it's easier to kill other players. 
---
/- Many player feel the game is less fun now, because it's easier to be killed. 
---
/- Many players feel the game is less fun now because there are fewer target to kill out in many regions of space.
---
/- Everyone seems to have an opinion about the monthly economic report that released earlier today. It's been called good, not that bad, and the literal death of the game by different people.
---
I feel like theres a bunch of people doomsdaying, kneejerking, sperging out and autistically reeeeing about changes to their playstyle. I'll admit that I am one of them sometimes, generally in support the changes.
---
Anyway, its definitely worth continuing with the game, I spent 4 years playing and this is the most fulfilling and memorable game I've ever played. By the time these kind if things will likely effect you there will probably be new metas developed, further changes to mechanics, and/or reversion of the changes. Or you may end up realizing that nullsec isn't for you and these specific changes may never have a significant effect on your playstyle.
---
EVE is a beautiful and deep game which has been memetically dying since one month after it launched in 2003. /r/eve has always been a hotbed for community members raging about X, Y, or Z. As it is, most of the rage recently has been about massive upheavals to the game's later-game content (DELETE LOCAL, Drifter invasions, Cynosural Field changes, Wormhole lifespans and usability, political interactions between different player organizations, capital ship uses and balance, ...) which you probably haven't come anywhere close to yet in your first week, and depending on how you play the game you probably won't encounter for a while. If anything, the devs have actually been trying to *improve* the new-player experience recently (with for instance a really nice batch of improvements and messages to the Ship Fitting window slated for next month).
---
(Since that paragraph included a bunch of said terms, if you want/ask I can elaborate on any of them.)
---
One thing I will say about having started playing: Don't go alone. Find a group like RvB or EVE University, and play with them for a while. Figure out what you like blowing up, and how you like blowing it up. Or how you like getting blown up. Explosions are kind of inevitable honestly.
---
All time most players, Nov. 19, 2019. Is that when alphas came out?
---
Hmmmm. I took the photo on the test server, singularity, where the complex appears to be working as intended. However, I just went there on the main server and it's as you found it - the blood kernel is missing and so are some of the other structures. It may be that the plex is bugged and the kernel isn't respawning on a timer as it should. If that's so, your best bet may be to rush the complex immediately after the server's downtime at 11:00 UTC, when it should be freshly respawned.
---
Alternatively, if you just want to have the mission over with, you can buy the blood fund item on contracts - it costs around 20 million ISK.
---
yep keep going this direction . So far so good . subs down and logins down .
---
Skill points did gate players to wait for titans.      
---
But so did production lines.     
---
If CCP didn't go for Sotiyos, Rorquals and Injectors at the same time, it wouldn't have been half as bad.
---
Any long running game will just be full of people saying it's dying.
---
For a long time it was dying because CCP was letting it stagnate and not changing enough.
---
Now it's dying because CCP is making large changes that may reshape a lot of the issues with the game (or at least shake them up for a bit).
---
It's still a great game, and the bulk of the bittervet complaints won't really affect you for quite a long time, and, in most cases, won't ever really trash your ability to enjoy the game.
---
I had to go back and re-look at the picture! But, yeah, that's interesting for sure. I would have guess it was a newer ship
---
what about my killboard ? lol
---
in the future?
---
go ahead and block me you unintelligent moron. You said the bans had an influence on the player drop, the bans happened PRE-JUNE, the player drop happened in JULY, you are the RETARD. You can go ahead and show yourself out.
---
Could have used an initial recap of what even Magic 14 skills are, and a point about how they are great, and eventually you'll want to get them all to 5, that doesn't mean you should totally put off other skills that allow you to have fun.
---
as it stands now the k162 spawns after someone jumps through giving you precious few seconds to get the jump on someone ratting. If you fail to get the jump the most common response is that they all dock up and log off not that a response is organized.
---
This comunity is dissatifsied most of the time.
---
We are just angry neckbeards
---
this is just going to fall to the same flaw as the old bounty system for players - wait for sufficiently large bounty and kill yourself for free isk.
---
all you'd end up doing is giving your target free money.
---
Try lowsec does not address the vast swaths of empty space.  Besides I do go to low, and I do enjoy it.  It's not the same though.  Strategically speaking it might as well be a different game.
---
i feel like ive spent mroe time huntin than most people so:  
---
ppl in space should only be a 12hr heatmap at lowest. how it is now is way too OP
---
esi npc kills needs to still exist or else basically going to be pointless to go hunting anywhere except delve or a main staging. vast majority of areas arent used regularly, and those that are change. 1hr delay already makes me miss a lot of ppl so i feel like its pretty fair. I either need local to show people who have been in system for X amount of time or npc kills to give me some general idea that there may actually be someone there. already i spend most of my time probing empty systems.
---
ccp definitely has done too much in a row to hurt big whales (cant kill anything if it doesnt undock... thxccp) 
---
i propose:
---
after 5-10mins you show up in local . this gives you a good window to setup coordinated ganks, but wont let me just farm ez killmails all day from ppl 100% unaware.
---
pilots in space,etc turns into a heatmap overlay, so you cant really tell the specific systems as easily as it all blobs over each other.
---
buff rorqs 50% back to where they were so they can actually mine enough to buy new excavators before i bomb them, but not oversupply minerals again.
---
incentivize carrier ratting again. maybe buff light fighter dmg, keep tracking nerfed so carriers get better tics but cant massacre entire smol gang fleets solo (especially since ewar changes). maybe make the BS in sites worth more? idk.
---
allow caps to keep fitting cynos. cyno on cap uses 20-33% of max capacitor. ratting titans are a fun target, as test showed us all today. its not really worth the effort to titan rat if you have to have a titan, a fax alt, and a cyno alt ready at all times. and i cant kill wat wont undock.
---
cynoinhib anchors in 30s, hp kept the same. ppl who are paying attention in a well fit cap/super should be able to kill them. ppl who arent paying attention shouldnt have time to join fleet, join coms, get told to add it to overview... and then kill it.
---
No it is not, and if you read other point  ... you will see that even with  significant reduction of blue loot value, WH space will still have insane income in T3 production materials.
---
Right, and given that the others are QoL upgrades aka replacements for POSs, the blame lies squarely on skill injectors since they were able to convert capital directly into titan pilots and titans 
---
Also the game is nearly 20 years old so the number of late game pilots is naturally going to be very high
---
The lack of paragraphs makes this completely unreadable.
---
&gt; There's no unknown intent
---
Bull fucking shit. If you expect people to waste their one chance to react to strangers dropping on-grid by reading some scumsucking bio, then you desperately need to upgrade your +INT implants.
---
Krab supers don't get SRP?
---
Depends. 500plex is 1.8B sell value. PVP ASF - Assault frigate fitted\* is around 0.25B so you can die 7 times ;D
---
Is it worth it? If u have no time and fat wallet then yes.
---
The design has existed for a long time but the actual ship was added somewhere in 2005 iirc.
---
Thinking about my options for after I move on from E-Uni, it looks like the ideal options for me would be either a wormhole corp or a SovNull alliance?
---
How many options would I have available to me if I was trying to get both at once? I know about Spoopy Newbies.
---
If I was running an armor fleet for Triglavians, I would definitely not turn down a Harbinger. My corp has generally run shield doctrines against them, though.
---
You can't bring it into Abyssal Deadspace. Only cruisers or frigates.
---
There's a ccp security email you could probably send the info to. They probably cant outright ban based on the info you send as discord messages can be manipulated, but they could probably investigate the person from their end.
---
I saw someone mention this in the public TIS chat and I thought it was a good idea.
---
I'm pretty sure it's from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, though not 100%.
---
Target selection is key to this issue.
---
Doubtful, you just don't hear the ones who aren't averse to change whinging
---
The subs been like this for years, I'm not sure there has ever been a time that the sky wasn't falling here
---
should rename the thread to: nullbear echochamber
---
Oh damn. I didn't think of that.
---
as in, don't target anyone because you're just pissing your isk up the wall?
---
As in target the right people who are not likely to pull that sort of thing, for a start checking if the fit has rigs gives you even more leeway.   It is actually rather easy to get this right if you use your brain.
---
which would be nobody - because why wouldn't you accept free isk?
---
Not to be a downer, but all I've read here is a mandatory faction for everyone's fresh PI/Industry/SP Farm characters.
---
So I have a structure with expensive rigs in it, I think someone is likely to come blap it for the bounty and the drops they get from the structure before I decide to take advantage of it, especially if the bounty is less than the value of the rigs.   Again it comes into the realm of intelligent game play and doing your normal trick of one line stupid replies just does not cut it.    If I was putting bounty on a structure I would make sure that the bounty was less than the value of the structure.     In terms of say the CODE structure in Niarja for example they could decide to pull that trick and lose their rigs and stuff because why not, but that is again down to target selection.
---
I am remembering why I stopped replying to you on the Eve forums.   :P
---
Well this is it,  skill injectors are the disease, but CCP are mainlining on the revenue so we are left with bandaids which are just treating the symtoms.
---
I'll believe things are changing if CCP caps injectors somehow, until then people will go on shitting out rorq/super/titan pilots.
---
damn it was 5AM for me ....^(after a bottle of brandy)
---
They already get an advantage, unless you're fighting on the undock of their staging, where I think it's fine to be able to reship quickly.
---
Funny you mention that when basically all of modern gaming is designed to be a painful grind, with the option to slide your credit card in to skip to the actual gameplay.
---
Stop being cheap and buy a 10$ mouse to replace the taxidermied rat you're currently using. I have a basic Logitech mouse, must have been 5$, hasn't let me down in almost a decade.
---
Nothing here fills me with confidence and everything a very vague
---
Structure Rigs are costly.
---
One might want to know if the structure is fitted before placing bounties.
---
Thanks
---
Your entire eve career? All 3 months of it? Why don't we make signatures automatically reveal themselves while we're at it? I say that's a huge qol change, greatly improves the game.
---
It was 15 or so years ago.
---
excellent piloting my friend. will use this as educational video.
---
Because Reddit is full of people who like complaining about the game.
---
The day before the Blackout was announced, many if the same people were talking about how Null Local is horrible. Before the cyno changes were announced, people talked about how horrible it is that you can easily cyno in whatever you need. When the game changes to fix what people complain about, they're going to switch to complaining about the fix.
---
instadocks inside the old model would just get stuck in the model.
---
TLDR: Train drones 5 first.
---
"Anything that can catch them" translates to "30 ceptors and a bunch of cruisers" for 3 assault frigates
---
Lol'd
---
StainGuy? This is not a shit post!
---
Now we just need a ansiblex gate you can link to a lowsec system.
---
Give force recons reduction in PG usage for capital cyno's. Allow heavy Cyno's to only be fittable on caps, but make it reduce remote rep or local rep, with normal capital cyno's not having that reduction.  
---
You could also make heavy disruptors useful by blocking heavy capital cyno's, and heavy Scrams able to block standard capital cyno's.
---
When people say that gallente are the best for drones it doesn't mean they have the best drones, not even necessarily the best drone-based ships as that depends on the role you want to fill. It means they have the largest variety of drone based hulls, so you can make the most of that weapon system. For example, the Curse or Pilgrim(amarr) are better support ships than the Ishtar(gallente) if you want to neut the enemy rather than do raw DPS.
---
As for drones, for anything besides sentries you have slow hard hitting ones to fast but relatively weak minmatar. The full spectrum is gallente-caldari-amarr-minmatar. For sentry drones, gallente have the best DPS, caldari have the longest range, and amarr and minmatar are in between with the first having a long optimal range and slightly more DPS and the second having less optimal but more range overall and I think better tracking.
---
Okay I'll see you in a week or a month
---
No, I literally mean there is no unknown intent. They are primarily there to pop your MTU. If you aggress, the secondary intent is to pop you. There's nothing unknown in that equation. Plus MTU hunters typically don't fly cloaky, there's little point to it.
---
 I dont know what drunken fucking night that was thought of but damn CCP needs to sober up.  It's like they are on a constant fucking pub crawl  with the amount of cant be arsed whatever attitude they seem to have.. honestly I seriously need to play my 40 xbox games I havent played Instead and stop investing in this BS.  Tbh most of it as I said was far far too vague.  Hilmar hasn't got the tiniest clue perhaps the worse CEO I've come across.  Had no vision  no long term strategy and most of all no fucking care in the world about Eve...tbh I feel this way about nost of the senior producers.  Pearl surely must have an exit strategy for him/then.
---
There are buy orders for blue loot in Stain

---
Basically a benevolent religious organisation. They believe that God lives on the far-side of the Eve Gate -- a now-collapsed wormhole that humanity originally came through to colonise New Eden. 
---
Because of their beliefs about divinity, they are *very* interested in wormholes. They've set up shop in the Thera wormhole, and quietly watch Drifter activity. For the most part, they're pacifists, and don't openly flex any military muscle. They're also very big on humanitarian aid, and disaster relief. All of this shows in their ships. 
---
Their spaceships -- the Astero, Stratios, and Nestor -- are geared towards exploration, all of which have probing and hacking bonuses. They also use drones quite a bit. All SOE ships have bonuses to drone durability. The cruiser and battleship have additional bonuses to drone damage, and laser range. But don't have bonuses to laser damage. 
---
The frigate and cruiser are the only non-T2 ships that can fit and use Covert Ops Cloaks, apart from some ultra-rare tournament prize ships. The battleship doesn't get this, but instead gets bonuses to remote-repair modules.
---
The game was too easy in the parts you mentioned. Nullsec is still too safe provided you're not an idiot.
---
I mean I don't think the cyno change is really needed because you guys in nullsec are literally so bad at the game you can't even fight back properly with heaps if ISK ready to go.
---
I agree CCP isnt properly thinking things true but at this point its still nothing to be crying over.
---
The only problem is that you got used to EZ mode ISK production and lack the dedication to get good at the game so here you are whining and "voting with your wallet" like a bunch of Karens
---
Thats good. Super ratting was a mistake in the first place.
---
The NPE should take new players through a decent sized (few hours of gameplay) mission and as rewards it should tell the player about each of the 14 and make it obvious how important these skills are.
---
NPE in stages.
---
* Stage 1, how to control your ship and basic flight
---
* Stage 2, how to Dscan and scan using probes( we all know the best option for new players is exploration )
---
* Stage 3, Mission Name "The first of the 14" , have the player go do something, in the process tell the player about this skill book hes going to collect and how important it is, when he completes the mission give him the NPE skill book as a reward(consumable lvl ups the skill by 1) , this single mission tells the player there are skills that are important and should be done fast, and the name of the mission tells them their are 13 others to find.
---
* Stage 4, Career agents, dont give the player the option, make them select combat first most new players are going to want to see some stuff blow up fairly early on, so have the combat mission agent teach the player about running missions and give him some more NPE consumable skill books, this will reneforce how important they are.  
---
The final mission of this stage should tell the player, Hay these skill your getting, go see the other agents to get more.
---
* Stage 5,6,7 would be a repeat of Stage 4 for each of the other agents.
---
* Stage 8, PVP, temporarily dump the player into the appropriate faction warefare faction, tell them their being given a single mission pass or something, and if they enjoy faction warfare they should goto X,Y,Z to join it fully, during this single mission have the new player jump through a wormhole into a pocket faction warefare system where all other new players are also sent, only allow people to enter if their lower than I dunno 2 million skill pints or something low enough to focus the group on real npe players, and give the player an unlimited supply of T1 frigates with a basic loadout, each time they die spawn them back at the agent and give them a fresh ship, show them losing their ship is nothing, show them pvp can be a good laugh and teach them the basics of combat, the goal is not to make pro pvp moves here its just to get over that fear and hump that pvp presents to most players.  
---
When they finish this mission by getting x kills or scoring y points or what ever the thing is, reward them with 10 free NPE T1 Frigates, new ship hull that cant be sold, or reprocessed, gives the player a buffer of ship thats they can blast around in until they make some isk to buy real ships.
---
* End out the NPE with a Medal, something to show for it in their bio, Player has completed basic training or something, and then and only then
---
An AF fitted is 250m now? When did that shoot up? I've not bought one in ages but have a lot in hanger, maybe I should sell them.
---
are you saying i should build up reputation with the intelligence service?  or... ?
---
Yes CCP announced the cyno changes as a grand conspiracy to sell injectors then released something to alleviate the problem before it was ever implemented in the game. You've done it, figured out their dastardly scheme you turbo mong.
---
I've said before, most of the EVE player base is a venn diagram of two circles completely overlapping: Stockholm Syndrome and the Sunken Cost Fallacy.
---
yes go recruit more players for eve to sell plex to, while they change the game to slowly metamorphosis into a streamlined themepark experience (to balance things out).
---
One of those, eh?
---
EvE has such a diverse range of activities that people all enjoy for their own reasons, and when any of these activities get a nerf those people come out and complain, and this community loves to see other peoples game be nerfed so they come and counter argue that the nerf is good, because of course its not touching their game play.
---
Then a month later their shit gets nerfed and they come complain and then other people repeat the cycle, people here seem to have a very resentful self destructive attitude to any gameplay style that is not their own, just ask them how they feel about miners, youll have every PvP player crawling out the woodwork screaming spodbrain at miners.
---
Ask people who love the PvE how they feel about the PvP players and you will get the same, ratters and miners and mission runners bemoaning how the PvP players are selfish and shit on anything thats not PvP.
---
As for recently CCP has made a number of changes, and plan more soon that are fundamentally fucking over a huge portion of their player base, to try to combat inflation and the generation of isk, but all its doing is hurting the smaller less organised groups while larger groups are handling it far simpler with their superior numbers.
---
My advice to you, and any new player is **DO NOT** use reddit as an example of the player base in game. the people who actually play the game are far less toxic.
---
Or now hear me out...
---
&gt; wait for sufficiently large bounty and kill yourself for free isk.
---
So basically if the structure is 10b fit, and the bounty is 10b, good job the person paying for it to get destroyed just threw 10b down the drain because they could just kill it themselves, get the 10b, buy a new one, and laugh they spent 10b on nothing.
---
Nobody uses the bounty system on PEOPLE just like nobody will be using it on structures.
---
Plus the fact is who in their right mind do you even imagine putting bounties on structures in the first place...?
---
Thanks a lot! Will try it out.
---
I played wow classic back when it was new, I do not see a point in playing it again, I'm not into repeating the same shit over and over like some ~~EvE player~~ moron...
---
no, because who cares about a corvette next to an npc station or upwell structure (where you have a dozen more cyno gens in reserve)
---
Part of the lag in There may be that probes have to move into position.
---
People may not realise because they're so quick that you don't normally notice, but scanner probes have a speed in AU/s (higher than regular ship warp speeds). When you click "scan" probes need to move from where they are (where you deployed then or where they were after the last scan finished) to the new position you set for then in the UI. Once they get into position then you see the scanning swipe animation. In most cases it's not noticeable but becomes so in There given the huge distances the probes need to travel.
---
Try this the next time you're in Thera: scan something on the edge of the system. Then click scan again without moving probes. The second time there shouldn't be be any lag. Now move your probes all the way to the other end of Their, click scan, watch the lag.
---
I'd recommend a few pulse Harbingers with at least three Augurors if you're going with Harbingers.
---
&gt;Tbh most of it as I said was far far too vague.
---
He more or less specifically implied it's vague because it's not his job to figure out the specifics. He's a CEO not a game designer.
---
Ofc it's his bloody job the CEO sets the strategy and direction of the company.  That's a massive cop out and just shows how much he knows fuck all about eve or even cares.
---
Funny you mention that when EvE is 16 years old, how long has Autopilot been there for? At least 12 years that I personally know of, was the "credit card warrior" gameplay a thing back then too? yet the autopilot was...
---
might work if you can't jump a rorq with an industrial core, either fitted or in cargo?
---
People love jumping on the hype bandwagon, and there are plenty of morons to support modern age "developers" that make unfinished games and then offer prepurchases to those exact morons. 
---
Same with eve there are just enough morons buying into all the shit CCP says and eating up all the lies on a daily basis that this game will live on for a while...
---
What if it's broken because it's missing the hour hand
---
annnnd you post this to reddit when im done coding my own :(
---
Also digital clocks with broken power wires
---
It’s the internet, people are whiners.
---
Wormholes small gang Null bloc big fleets and structure bashing (thanks fozzie) depends where your interests are. Applying to null pick a side as unless your Corp moves its hard for a single pilot to shift over so you go to Goonswarm Pandemic Horde and allies are now probably closed to you. Join a null bloc wormhole corp same rules apply the other side is probably not going to take you after that.  Wormhole corps may have a higher SP and ISK req as they tend to fly more expensive skill intensive ships Null bloc less so and as they take more pilots its easier to get in.
---
If you can find It outside of sadpanda it's not yet the nope factor
---
CEOs are not the people designing mechanics in video games. CEOs tell their staff a direction and the staff presents to them their best interpretation. Hilmar is likely not a game dev or a programmer doesn't know enough about the game to design it, the people he hired to make the game do. Hilmar is expected to be one of the faces of the company and a paper pusher while providing Eve a direction. He stated what direction he wants to take the game but if the specifics were left up to him it would be a disaster. I'd wager the majority of CEOs don't know a ton about how the line members of their company do their job because it's not the CEOs job to care, it's a managers job to care.
---
My short term plan would be to make more money than the company spends to make that money. We can invent a word for that concept to shorten future dialogue. How about profotamy! 
---
My long term plan will be to even make more money but in order for that to happen we will need more money. My idea is this, we allow people to give us money with the promise that we will give them more money at a later date. This way we will have the required money to make more money compared to our short term profotomy.
---
Easy work around: make it so bounty can only be placed on structures that can't be killed in the next 48h. Makes the RMT far less certain.
---
Yep a good PVP fit is 250M+.
---
Alot of suggestions fail to keep in scope whether some change will affect smaller or bigger corp more.
---
Wow stop posting tou have no idea what you're talking about
---
They is, just because some dude wrote that they isnt doesn mean they isnt, a year back or some shit iirc they was a timer of around 5 hours for c5 wormholes.
---
Not saying im right and hes wrong, im saying because he said it doesn mean hes right and im wrong :)
---
TBH only a dev could answer this correctly im pretty sure, its impossible to test it really
---
I am curious what part of my writing that eve hinted at that interpretation. 
---
As it stands today I can roll a fresh hole blindly, every one jumps out and everyone comes back at the same time. A higher variability would not change visual queues of shrinkage and becoming critical. But it would require you to actually monitor the status of the wormhole as you jump. The equation of how much of a combat fleet you can fit through would also become more unpredictable. Case in point, the corps that take their wormhole just shy off massed before a fight to prevent reinforcements or attackers following them back.
---
First you were complaining nobody wants to play cat and mouse with you, now space is too empty.
---
Well then it’s right once a day if your reading it in 24 hour time
---
Bite me micro 😂🍻
---
Because CCP is fucking up the game even more.
---
&gt; CCP will just think why do we need to listen to these clowns. 
---
they already think that
---
Someone to proof read my posts
---
I guess you guys are getting this wrong. He doesn't want to nerf Titans to be useless. He wants the asset safety to go away. Which is correct. THAT would drive up wars. Because bashing structures will then be rewarding, rather that simply just boring. At least in null, that makes perfect sense. Why is the "no rules here" area as safe as fucking highsec?
---
Everything else which isn't blue. And if your corp hasn't blued Signal Cartel, you need a different corp.
---
This.
---
It could pair with the current highsec war dec mechanics.
---
Try to make it enticing for third-party corps to try to take out you enemy's war-causing structure.
---
I asked this when the structures were in development, as I wanted a limited size hangar for people who live in w-space, if the corporation chooses such a limit.
---
Essentially one of the most taxing systems on POSes before was the fact that it had to constantly recalculate all the volume changes based on every member in the structure. It put high strain onto the servers that handled item management.
---
But I think CCP needs to head to their original plan. Drydocks in space where Titans can safely hard tether, but with the risk that destroying the structure leaves Titans unprotected and boardable.
---
Yes we'll not speak of the infrastructure and preparation required to pull off a succesful WH krabbing session.
---
Have.. have you ever lived in WH space?
---
If you were
---
Hic changes?
---
I don't think it will take long. Even being a member of gsf it was hard for me to say "this isn't worth paying money for" and call it quits. But it's really the only message they seem to understand is when you hit their pocketbook. I did pay $$ for a few subs on mine, and unless they turn a 180 I see no reason to return. Was fun for 10 years.
---
Killmail generating server? Ded.
---
Then do not fly a super capital or Titan. You want that freedom of no risk, I get it. I am not a fan of structures dropping the items when you are absent.
---
I am however very much in favour for raising the cost for asset safety to 60%  of value and then out of all that asset safety have 50% of the costs paid to those that killed a structure.
---
It could work if it was combined with the "way to put chips on the table past implants" idea, so it's opt in and not forced on anyone. Like you agree to be locked out of a ship for 24 hours or whatever if you die in it but you get 5% more damage or some other small boost while it lives.
---
ELI5?
---
It deals with incestuous rape, regular rape, drug addiction, physical assault, prostitution, and a few other things that would spoil the end all to a high school girl.
---
and if there was no rf on low power structures
---
Good analysis thanks.
---
So the takeaway here, imo, is that (despite the crying of rorqual pilots) mining hasn't changed much. Ratting bounties have gone down a lot, which is good, because they were far too high and AFKable (or bottable) and most of the decline is probably in people not running AFK VNI farms (or bot farms).
---
Not a conclusion from this data, but we could probably improve the null experience by having fewer sites, but making them pay better.
---
&gt;However, this sub seems discontent with recent updates.
---
Dude, the EVE subreddit is *always* like that. About *everything*. Most of the people who post here are jaded bittervets (older players who have invested far too much into this game), half of them don't even play anymore, and it's generally cancerous.
---
&gt;Did I pick a bad time to start playing? Is it even worth it to get into this game at the moment, or should I look for something else with a more promising future?
---
Arguably you picked the best time to start playing. There's actually shit happening, after the better part of half a decade of utter stagnation. The things most people are complaining about are exactly the things that should get you interested in playing EVE.
---
While EVE is losing peak concurrent users, easily 90% of the people leaving the game are either A: Alt accounts, B: Bots, or C: Pansies that just want Farmville In Space and are upset that they can't have it. The people that actually play the game and enjoy it for what it is are more than active.
---
for a moment I thought I'm clickt on my wrong  bookmarks\^\^
---
&gt;Certain people would rather be kings of a dying game
---
Nailed it.
---
there's a [security@ccpgames.com](mailto:security@ccpgames.com) where you can send that stuff to, this ends up in the mailbox of Team Security. Please mind though, they do look into your reports, but will not reply to your email.
---
That doesn't answer my question. I already know everything that you said.
---
To rephrase: Is Spoopy Newbies (in Brave) the only NullBloc corp based in a wormhole or are there others? Is a corp like that a worthwhile mix of the two playstyles?
---
The problem is more that the CEO of CCP has only now started looking at EVE whereas before the cunt was off spending money on other dumb ass game development that was never going to succeed.
---
Good for you.
---
\&gt;at close range our weapons tore them to shreds
---
barely breaking legions
---
So i haven’t been playing for a decade like some of the bitter vets but I have had a fair share of experience doing all different things. And if I was made CCP CEO tomorrow I would change a few thing. 
---
1. Get rid of the blackout. I know im probably going to get shit on for saying that but hear me out. Instead of all of null being in a blackout have it in a few regions at a time and have it move region to region almost the same way incursions move. This would I feel this would let strategical moves and ops of the blacked out regions. As of right now it null feels less action packed due to the blanket of darkness on it has nobody want to anything but play cloaky bomber/T3C online. 
---
2. The up and coming Cyno changes are fine but I would let more then 2 classes of ship able to light them. I would add maybe 2 or 3 more sub cap classes (at least one of which is a T1 class) and the only capital that can light a cyno would be a FAX as that is what is used to get a decent tanked cyno on grid for capital fights.
---
3. Make high sec more rewarding for new players and harder for vets. Meaning give a way to reward new player just getting started so they can afford to fit that shiny new bellicose or drake to play with. And for the love of god make a new tutorial that shows new players things that vital to fleets and other activities like adding someone to your watchlist or broadcasting for reps in the fleet window, it took me longer that I want to admit to figure that out for the first time.
---
Yep let’s have 1000s of players that mostly do t know each other or really care and think of PvP as their alt activity that their overlords( FCs) have to force them to do or their kicked. ..... what other space is currently like that I wonder?
---
Awesome idea! - Have an upvote.
---
I disagree. Imo Sotiyos are worse, and Rorquals finally begin to be acceptable.
---
Having them be boardable is retarded. People will just safe log off rather than tether.
---
I love the fact Eve Uni still think they own the right to a list of skills any decent player, corp or alliance can advise players on...
---
CEOs and upper management who know nothing about their product or their customers and like to jack off to numbers that mean nothing are common place in every other industry, why does it always surprise people that video games are any different?
---
That's because it isn't the cause of the issue. Injectors only contribution to this problem was that it allowed eve online to reach this critical situation when it  comes to titans and supers much faster than it would have naturally, but **it was going to happen eventually** regardless of the existence of injectors. 
---
But this isn't a huge mountain that ccp needs to climb in order to fix it, all they have to do is take a giant fucking hammer to supers and faxes and hit it until these ships stop moving.
---
Yeah... Perhaps that's a 'In a perfect world' scenario.
---
No. You picked a great time to start ans I just subbed another account. Some people are in a tiff because the ceo of ccp a discussion on how wormholes should be shaken up. It won't really affect new players and the method chosen in the rnd would probably be to make nearly dead wormholes die faster
---
I'm reminded of a certain phrase that recently echoed out of numerous wormholes and into null space: "adapt or die".
---
That would just end in every time pilot spawning his own forti. Apart from more citadel spam, you wouldn't gain anything here.
---
It is good as it is with the keepstars. Those are expensive and you can shut down one if you want to.
---
Are you seriously complaining about traveling being boring? Or is your problem that there's a way to "skip" that boredom, if autopilot even counts as skipping?
---
There are other Null bloc wormhole corps I believe Pandemic Horde have one there may be others.  In my opinion joining a null bloc wormhole corp is probably not the best mix and I would not do it. In the past I have flown in wormhole corps (Sleeper Social Club) and now for RL reasons fly in Null I don't think you can mix the different play styles. However others who have more experience of doing so may have a different view this is just my opinion.
---
If you could put up a POS there, then that doesn’t sound like a safe spot. Perhaps we have different definitions of safe spot?
---
Run combat probes on system wide scan.
---
Is there any reason we shouldn't just get rid of the Drones skill?
---
Walking in stations...

I want a bar, I want a strip club, I want a karaoke club so "The Doo" can play eve and rock the fuck outa jita. I want a corp and or alliance lobby for guests, they walk in take a seat read some magazines, this lobby would be in the entry way to the corp private area which should have a corp bar, corp office for private meetings, and an arcade I wana be able to walk over to the trade district buy a new arcade machine (space invaders?) for my corp hanger, walk back to our corp lobby, take the lift to our private corp only area walk over to the corp bar and place the new shiny arcade machine,  a corp member then walks over see's space invaders and goes WTF I LURV space invaders, he walks over drops in 1000 isk or what ever the ceo sets the cost per play and he plays the game.
---
In the meeting room I want chairs, with a holo table that I can bring up the galaxy map, region map, constilation map and system maps, I want to be able to see bookmarks in this view, I want to be able to place little markers so I can walk the people in the room with me through a strategy. I want to be able to load a ship for display on this table and see its fitting and have all the people in the room be able to see and all be able to contribute changes to the fit so we can as a group figure out fittings.
---
Giving up on walking in stations was a huge missed opportunity.
---
&gt;Be interesting to know seeing everyone has an opinion

Opinions are like rectums: Everyone has one and they're all full of shit.

NOOOOOO!!!!!!

Take my upvote. *hides post*
---
Only after you recognize who dropped in on your pocket. And that means taking time away from evasive maneuvers. Funny how they have the same trouble wrapping their heads around the concept of reacting to a potential threat rather than immediately assuming the complete fucking stranger is friendly.
---
Let me tell you a bit of WH farming.
---
If you live in medium sized corp the local sites are done the second they spawn. So you rarely get to do local sites.
---
So what do you do? Roll static to get new sites. With 2 BS's it takes \~10mins to roll hole (A lot faster if 4 BS's or VL hole rolling with cap). -&gt; Scan the new hole, check every hole in it (If it actually had sites worth doing...) -&gt; place eyes on every hole (avg. 2-3 accounts needed). 
---
For static sites its normal to use 2 rattlesnakes if doing solo (thats 5 accounts needed bare minimum at this point.). To be able to do drifter boss in C5 etc requires at least 2 basis for combat cap and 4 rattlesnakes for scrams&amp;webs.
---
Oh and nearly forgot 1 acc needed for scanning new sigs the moment it pops up. btw sometimes it can take 2-3h of rolling / scanning to get static that has sites in it. Sometimes you get lucky sometimes you don't. WH life doesnt really have pickup and play, it requires lucrative tasks for hours before you actually get to the money making part.
---
Outstanding! An intelligent well thought out response! Both in terms of reddit and your plans vis a vis CCP!
---
I salute you Sir!
---
You still are for strategic things. And you know this. Don't lie to yourself, it makes you look stupid.
---
&gt;Because screw CCP and their shotgun testing of bad ideas. It's getting out of hand recently.
---
cheap, effortless changes. Most of these "chaos" things require no real dev capacities - perhaps they don't have enough anymore ...
---
There is literally no way that ccp is making this changes in order to get more money, the blackout itself likely costed them a significant amount of money from people ( some bots too?) quitting due to their chosen gameplay style being essentially nerfed into the ground.
---
I'm sure people could make the argument that the new cyno changes are there to increase demand for injectors, but i'm sure there are far easier ways for them to make money quickly, with plex sales, skin sales... the sort of stuff that CCP was doing prior to the sale to PA being announced, which at the time people interpreted as CCP trying to make their books more appealing to a possible sale.
---
Point is, no this isn't CCP trying to suck more money from their player base, I think when Hilmar said that he wanted to do bold stuff to the game now rather than keep doing the same old safe development strategy to be pretty accurate.
---
Hell, just based on what we know from looking at the average daily player count for the past years, eve online has been on never ending downward trend, the "safe" development strategy that ccp has been on about for the past few years isn't working and i think its pretty clear that Hilmar saw that and decided to give some marching orders to the devs to start throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.
---
Or ideally they should just end up intrinsic to a new toon. It’s a roadblock for new players to jump into more things to have fun for the sake of roadblocks.
---
What if you had to pay the bounty if you wanted to unanchor/transfer it.
---
CCP NAKED hired confirmed.
---
Focus on the new player journey over 80% of new players leave by day 30 that is a bad stat that needs to change. EVE is still "have a ship fuck you" and we need to address that so everyone benefits the new guys become better and bring new life to balance out the vets that are either leaving or scaling back for RL reasons. 
---
We need to do something about Low Sec I know there are loads of posts on it by far better Low Sec pilots than me but come on CCP is that the best for low sec.  Null and wormholes look like they are either in or going to be in a state of change so lets see how that falls out first.
---
False accusations! We are honest Caldari traders and manufacturers!
---
Its always the best time to get back to anime:)
---
Afaik your plan sounds just fine
---
&gt;so dissatisfied at the moment
---
Sweetheart: EVE players are -always- dissatisfied about something. Do anything in EVE: somebody’s dissatisfied.
---
I have never known EVE players to be anything else but dissatisfied.
---
You read posts where people complain about EVE, you should gain a broad smile on your lips and breathe easy in the sure knowledge that New Eden is doing just fine :-).
---
wronk
---
Walking in stations was never the point of Eve. What, you want some world of warcraft nonsense where you put your avatar near the mailbox and jump  up and down constantly (as opposed to spinning your ship in private, i *know*, but shut up)
---
what would have been the point? especially with the dilution of stations (multiple citadels per system...), this just wouldnt add anything to the game. while it might have been a nice feature for an alliance if the game only allowed 1 outpost/citadel/station for your entire organisation, in the current game it would be just you walking around an empty generic scifi plaza
---
So too difficult then, got it.
---
EvE continues to evolve so saying it wasn't the point is the dumbest thing you have ever said gg..
---
And yeah I made it clear, I wana walk around, I wana walk into a bar and play poker with other players, or walk over to a pinball machine and play some pinball, or some space invaders while I am bored and waiting for something else to happen.
---
The number of stations in space is irrelevant so not sure what your deal is there, they could make the layout procedural so every station would look a little different, and if its procedural it can dynamically expand or contract as more corps make or remove offices in that station.
---
Stations with agents could have the agents in the bar like freelancer, wander over to the bar see what agents are available and then just interact with them, man I miss freelancer.
---
There's lots of very loud "players" here who aren't even playing anymore. Just ignore them, if you're having fun in the game you're good.
---
WOOSH!

So firesale titans before multiple nerfbats?
---
Short: Improve NPE to not be terrible and actually be interesting
---
long: change even more things that will break up donuts and coalitions
---
Look at my name smoothbrain
---
Wait did somebody have a good idea on reddit?
---
&gt; Case in point, the corps that take their wormhole just shy off massed before a fight to prevent reinforcements or attackers following them back.
---
Sure, but random variations would make that harder, not easier. That, generally, means fewer fights. Afterall, are you going to jump a fleet through a wormhole that's stage two if it might be a (for example) a -50% variant? What if it were a -50% VOC hole?
---
If someone has taken the trouble to combat scan down your pocket, warp over, jump through the gate then you can almost automatically assume they aren't coming in to hold your hand and sing you lullabies. They are there to pull some shenanigans one way or another. 
---
I'm not sure what you're talking about, as you've seem to totally misunderstood what I'm spelling out to you. I hope the above clarifies. If I warp in, I'm there to shoot your MTU and hope you react. That is all.
---
Sandbox tho. If supers used normal drones, I should be able to mine with one were I that way inclined

Magic 14 is a an old relic from different times, it's not actually useful and it certainly shouldn't be said to newbies to train. These days starting characters get way more skills meaning that right off the bat they can fit and use basic ships just fine, unlike back then.
---
Newbies should use their skill points to unlock different ships, weapons and play styles so they can sample it all and find their own niche. They can do the boring skills later on. Telling them to train boring skills that don't unlock anything other than "make stuff work a bit better" is telling them to quit.
---
Long training plans are for alts you don't use till their training is done, or for good little soldiers who join one's massive "newbie friendly" army.  it's not for new players who you want to nurture and help them figure out their own play style.
---
Indeed.
---
EvE has had historical problem of no clear roadmap to us mere mortals.
---
CCP keep jumping from development of features to features but no clear idea of what to do. From back in the day of forcing people from gathering in systems to removing faster ways of travelling around to removing market hubs to then 10yrs on going back to what it was and trying to force people to be more self sufficient in groups and stronger together to trying to force them apart.
---
All this stems from retarded decisions that most of the playerbase agree is retarded and them being SLOW AS FUCK to try and fix.
---
Current "chaos" doesn't help them in anyway since I doubt they have a roadmap in place for this either judging by the crises they keep developing off their stupidity.
---
You can'y even critise on their own forum without being banned and there mouth trumpet ones that keep using reddit as a platform have shown to pretty much follow the REEEEE crowd and keep making even more retarded decisions.
---

Don't know if you saw this.  They gave out some numbers on botting.
---
Not a bad idea. Maybe. Thanks.
---
That's maybe I'll do it, not maybe thanks :)
---
Bounty sharing? Let's go the casino style! Final blow gets the bounty. The strongest and the quickest gets the loot.
---
It's PVeing, stop lying to yourself. That's like saying "lol we killed this mission running  Raven real good, with 44 lokis". 
---
Also, choosing to be a part of the biggest group in the game in and of itself is already carebear. Mind you, I'm not part of any coalition (for that reason) and to me what you just shown is everything that's wrong with EVE and Null: terrible carebears doing the N+1.
---
No mass limit means wormhole corps will grow and grow in population until they reach Null sizes. For those of use who have lived in big blocs and left that means the watering down of tight knit communities and Corp cultures where people have to pull their weight as individuals. It will become just like null. Where PvP is secondary to krabbing and you don’t know who half the people in fleet with you are and frankly don’t really care to know. There is a pretty good reason people go to WHs after leaving the blue donuts.
---
This really should be a priority for CCP. I know /r/eve is going to collectively *REEE* about EVE becoming WoW. But EVE desperately needs to introduce farmable multiplayer content (similar to incursions or multi-player missions). The average PVEer is forced to play solo, which is not good for an MMO.
---
My instadock in the model yeets my freighter everytime. feelssonicman

That’s the problem right there “ blob”. We don’t want the mindless F1 blob combat. That’s the point.
---
Christ. Look at ratting titans. You have alt scouting , dst to move stront , fax and spare cyno.    70bil in setup .... and structures in system to pull it off.            
---
Super ratting 1 less char but around 20bil in space not including structures.         
---
Rorqal mining ? 6 bil per rorqual, 80 bil in T2 rigged tatara.           
---
On top of this mythical umbrella. 50- 150 people that will come to your aid if needed.             
---
Sorry but nullsec succesfull krabing session require bigger infrastructure and preparation
---
Right?
---
There would definitely need to be some nuanced planning to prevent this. If a structure is active it may be a huge pain to do this. Industry jobs, market orders, clones are all gone. Unanchoring and re-anchoring a new citadel takes time, you have to shuffle assets from old to new. What happens if Wingspann or Pirat starts issuing wardecs to clean structures because it's profitable? Now you have 5b payout from your structure because their is another fleet you're splitting the payment with.
---
sad troll attempt
---
Didn't even think about this, but you're right and that's awesome!
---
Mostly I'd like it not to be powered by tendonitis.
---
I'm not asking for a 10hz real-time system wide perfect radar or anything, but it would be neat to be able to configure your autorefreshing DSCAN with balance between refresh rate, angle, and range. EG: you're ratting an anom 8 AU from the nearest gate, so you reduce your DSCAN range from 14 to 8.5 AU, and this allows your DSCAN to refresh more frequently
---
It would also be cool if different ships had different bonuses to those aspects. So maybe capital DSCAN has more powerful range (say 21AU vs 14 AU), but updates less often (base of 10 seconds instead of 5 seconds or whatever), or Interceptor DSCAN gets a lot better when it's on a restricted angle, and so on.
---
Another thought that occurred to me is that IRL, one of the easiest ways to detect something is to look for it's active sensor emissions. If the DSCAN had a "power slider", then turning down (or even off) the power of your DSCAN might make it harder to detect your ship if you're running dark - reducing the range at which other ships detect you by a certain percentage.
---
OH! ITS PVEING!! I guess we should avoid blapping the fuck out of it then. Cause you know, some random shitlord could call me a carebear on reddit!
---
wow bro this is really next level
---
&gt; One might want to know if the structure is fitted before placing bounties.
---
scan it.

---
That's not what I said, you know this. But feel free to twist words.
---
When did this happen? I don't remember a supercap fleet dying in quite a while.
---
This is where people come to complain that the game is too hard.
---
How can you have multiplayer pve, when the pve players demand afkable zero effort/knowledge pve.
---
Rorquals are pretty damn haulers.  Fyi
---
i'm pretty sure they're talking about an in-game cost. like fueling a pos/citadel. not a real money thing
---
&gt; There would definitely need to be some nuanced planning to prevent this.
---
if there was - the regular bounty system wouldn't be shit and this would be a good idea.
---
the idea comes from a good place - but there's no way to implement it in a non-retarded easily exploitable way.
---
Some people use those structures for ISK. Bringing in a JF full of stuff regularly makes you look like a juicy target.
---
no, they aren't
---
Just look at the item history.
---
Indeed, this is like the only place bounties actually matter. I don't know any freighter gankers, do they actually check for bounties or it is so rare they don't bother?
---
But this is not the point.  Point is that blue loot is injecting way to much isk.         
---
Wh space is unique ... all T3 ships come from WH materials. Like this is huuuuge amount of materials.          
---
Rorqual mining in WH space is also possible now on large scale.
---
Haha oops
---
So great.
---
I'm holding back more gold (and isk) for Red Glowing Dust, Nouvelle Rouvenour Hero, Precious Ore, and Merchants, Looters, Ghosts though!
---
correct, titans are meant to be hardcore srs bsns play items, not casual reships for your main.  
---
you can play casually with the vast majority of the ships in the game. i don't think it's bad that the ulitmate apex vessel requires a little more investment.
---
And why should they care what you think? If you got nothing positive to add, just don't post. There are dozens of videos posted to this sub like this every month. And now it is suddenly "PVE-ing" and "carebearing" to drop dreads on a titan? We should tell Pest Control to just stop then hmm?
---
welcome to online games.

Racial carrier 5, sentry drones interfacing 5, fighter 5

Ya got punked. Goodbye.

Probably because krabbing is so ludicrous and easy even for new players that a large swath of the even new players will rarely have to pay for subs or plex.
---
I'll upload the view from the dictors. You know, where we didn't make it couse it was out of range. Lol
---
The problem is that the same geniuses that created one failure after another, will now be focusing all their time and energy on making one bad decision after another for EVE. :p
---
&gt;If you got nothing positive to add, just don't post
---
That sounds awfully carebear of you. Also where am I stating the OP is PVEing? 
---
If all you can do is froth at the mouth and stating nonsense when someone disagrees with you, then I can see how one would be part of the peer pressure coalitions where everyone thinks and does the same thing, like good little cogs. There's a word for that, you know.
---
The best times are behind us.  Especially for certain playstyles.  It can still be fun, but you missed out on what made eve great.
---
The time span of this is so far from normal short term memory, let alone"extreme short term"

What type of playstyle is that? Ruining the economy through hyperkrabbing?

You picked the exact right time to start playing!

The people who are unhappy and whining atm are the ones who created, nurtured and are part of the stagnant terrible grind culture where everyone is part of one of 3 factions. 
---
Feel free to enjoy the game, find your own niche and play style, don't listen to people telling you how to play, what to fly or what you should be doing. Because what they're really just saying is "be a good little generic player". Find your own style, find your own niche, enjoy it, do weird and silly things. Go for it.
---
Shitposting to 5 is crucial as well
---
Unfortunately they never coded collision right, and they fudged up ship scales at the higher end (even more so as they partially fixed this on new shiptypes they made like the FAX, but thus far havent followed through on all cap types...)  
---
So yeah, proper collision would be nice, but that appears to be out of their grasp from a technical standpoint (spaghetti code I guess...)

GP isn’t saying anything of worth. He’s just being an ass and you basically called him out on it in a diplomatic way. Good on you. But he won’t answer your question because there is no logical conclusion to his asinine bullshit.
---
I doubt that. Even if it's absolute spaghetti code and they can't disable it properly, they could simply override the value being returned by whatever subroutine is providing it by literally adding/changing a single line of code. It wouldn't be pretty, but it would get the job done.
---
Theres always one twat who simply cant help themselves 😂😂👍
---
Bro. If you think that’s a stat, you need your head examined. It’s anecdotal at best and asinine most likely.
---
I imagine they could do it if they put more time into the code; but it's perhaps debatable how useful the code could be.
---
Taking actual time to acquire SP post-2016, lul.

it would make sense for capital ships, not subcaps

I took your advice and logged in right after the reset and it was there! Took me awhile to blow the kernel up to access the cargo hold because NPC kept respawning, but I got it.  Now I know why they go for 20M in contract. 
---
Thank you very much for your help!
---
Isolated both the blackout and cyno changes look like steps towards balancing yes.  
---
Put together its like taking the eyes and then the hands away from the nullsec blocs. What that is supposed to promote, I do not know.  
---
What is clear, is that large scale battles with capital ships will be extremely rare, if not nonexistent. It will become a case of getting your force on grid first, at which point it will be impossible for the enemy to get sufficient numbers on grid to fight instead of feed.  
---
But who knows, the blocs may come up with inventive new ways to deploy capital (and supercapital) assets, that no longer rely on massive blobs. It could happen, but with the "nerfs" to capital vessels over the past few years, they're not really usable in say, decentralized pockets of relatively small rapid reaction forces spread through your territory. First CCP made it so they can only be of use (and not an easy KM) in large blobs, then CCP decides to nerf the ability to gather and move said blobs of caps, because they don't like blobbing.
---
Then play other games for fucks sake. Why does everything have to be the same? You don’t like spending time playing eve then fucking don’t. But some others probably do and the entire world can’t fit the exact description of median. Why can’t eve be a game that doesn’t offer instant gratification? If it dies it dies being something unique -  not league of legends in space.
---
If you are already traumatized and want the fixed ending it’s 265918

I love how this thread is full of wormholers supporting a change that will increase our risks making money. I just hope it isn't something like making holes not spawn instantly when rolled, that'd hurt rage rolling and also increase ratting safety... The worst of both worlds.

Your post is "Dude this one time..50 feroxs happened." Then you repeat what I said about throw away Sigils. 
---
If these changes go through EVERYONE will have to fight over holes. They will change from a entrance that either side can close when they want, as both of us pointed out, to a  noj mass limited timed wormhole.
---
This means it basically becomes a stargate. And with the limting factor of mass removed the PVP oppertunities and benifits of a stargate come with it. Gate camps, bigger and better reinforcements, etc.
---
The fact you wormholers are so salty about a POTENTIAL change is fucking hilarious.

I have already seen the JoJo fix for it :P

Super ratting is fine, not our fault no one else wanted to take advantage

There's no such thing as a Jita wormhole and you can't get a super into a wormhole (supers in wormholes would flat out break them and I guarente every major wormhole entity would protest anything that let supers in.

Right now a super in a wormhole is a bannable offence by CCP.

I was assuming that would be the case, as it was pretty obvious to me.

1 out of 100 persons satisfied will express himself, and you won't notice it.

250 out of 100 person unsatisfied will express himself, and you will notice it.
---
It's the same everywhere. Whenever there is anything you notice more the people who are disatisfied,unless the people satisfied are in your close group. That's because your brain is wirred to react to danger and people yelling/insulting other is a way to express danger.
---
So you know that all those person who insult / use bad words / keep exaggerating don't want to make a point, but instead to make you \*feel\* like there is an issue. The only solution for you is to laugh at their incorrect tone and downvote them. If hey insult, you insult more, if they exaggerate you exaggerate even more. Even if you agree with the issue. Those persons are the cancer of the community, spamming the existing nice shitposts (which are just communication) with propaganda and they deserve to be shat on.
---
You two peas in a pod should just quit thinking about this game if everything sucks so much.
---
I mean I can’t disagree with what you’re saying but things have gotten a lot better since 2005, where it actually was “here’s a ship fuck you.”
---
Get the money and run away. It's beyond saving.
---
Alpha damage means the damage that can be done right now with your resources. It’s not describing very first strike, it’s context dependent. The term likely comes from “alpha strike”, which started as a military term and turned into a “kill it with everything” trope.
---
You used the term correctly. You could say volleyed, but that would not affect the meaning.
---
Or hear me out.    There are various entities in hisec that blow up structures, putting a bounty on one will make it more enticing and further up the list of ISK making targets.      People make ISK blowing up low powered structures as they drop P4's.
---
This would enable people who do not have the ability to blow them up but have the cash to pay someone to apply targeted awards.
---
There are reasons why it does not work for characters, now try to apply those issues to a structure and then think.
---
The 10bn = 10bn issue only applies if the bounty is greater than the structure plus rig value which entices the owner to create a war dec corp and blap his own structure.   But if the bounty on a structure is 2bn and the value is 10bn which means it will drop more loot then war deckers might go yep, I will go for that one.
---
come on it was just 10 times more DPS than it should, I had no issue with it.
---
Our sites spawn over days not minutes. So by your logic it can support 1 person. I'm going to have to agree with liszt here in saying that you don't understand wormhole ratting.
---
&gt; 80% of new players leave by day 30 that is a bad stat that needs to change.

I think that's pretty normal for all free to play MMORPGs.
---
Add to this more explanations in the s.o.e. epic arc. Explain kiting, brawling, active, passive, speed and buffer tanking, and maybe have them try out all weapon types, showing the advantage and disadvantage of each. Just a thought.
---
 *but there's no way to implement it in a non-retarded easily exploitable way.* 
---
But you have not proven that it is easily exploitable, the sole exception would be if the value of the bounty was greater than the structure and its rigs, or if the person owning it wanted to pull it down and blowing it up would give him a greater return due to rig cost.
---
&gt; people live in c5s exclusively to be able to rage roll.
---
I know. They do it as its the eaiest form of both defence and offence. Want to find a fight. Rage roll, enemy fleet coming up your chain, rage roll. Linked sytem not interesting rage roll.
---
There is very little risk in rage rolling. Thats why CCP are considering this. WH is too safe. Now you have to actually to fight the fleet coming up your chain, do as much damage as possible in PvP action until either they die, you die or the hole closes. Want to attack null be prepared for null to jump into you hole with large fleets as they can now have a nette chance of getting out. Did you get a hole to A Nullbear's mining system, had a rorq in panic but they brought a few to many people? You now can reship into biger stuff and yet back to the fight.
---
The question I have ia why are you so salty about a change that will only increase the options for PvP? Do you not like the Age of Chaos?
---
Because we're past the honeymoon phase.
---
When you are mission running it is actually better isk management to not do that so you do not overkill the npc.  Guns are more likely to shutoff just in time.
---
It s like this and it continues. If you dont think it s stats what will you think when it will be 10k. Oh wait. It will be closed before :D
---
Activity has dropped A LOT. It s a fact.
---
Sorry, let me rephrase it.  
---
You anchor/tether the Titan to a structure and then if that is destroyed without you picking up the Titan, it becomes free to take for whoever destroyed it. No more Keepstar docking.
---
It already work if you place bounty on the owner of the station :)
---
Sounds like you want a single player game where your actions only affect you. Your precious non botting non afk vni was fucking broken and they fixed it.
---
You dont need any of that. You need a single dead end system with 1 scout watching the gate and you have to run sites off dscan from the gate OR have a scout on the in-gate out of system and rat at leisure. Assuming you have a brain and aren't afk you can't get caught.
---
I'm sorry but you seem to lack experience/knowledge to be engaging in these subjects.
---
&gt; you guys
---
who is you guys? people competent at flying pixel spaceships?
---
&gt;  You're gonna catch a lot who stop mashing dscan constantly. 
---
so people are being dumb and expect to live? why exactly? 
---
&gt;  Nope. Tank on a solo carrier is not terribly good, even when fit for tank. 
---
it also isn´t terribly bad. 
---
&gt;  Golly, perhaps you could bring three ships with a point then. You only need to keep one up. 
---
i might as well not undock any kind of ship in any kind of environment because i might encounter this or that at any given point in time. 
---
&gt; If that were actually true, you guys wouldn't have spent years whining about us being able to cyno in a rescue fleet. 
---
I spend years in all kinds of nullsec alliances and blocs, with my main and with alts. Personal experience tells me otherwise. There is no incentive to git gud and the overwhelming majority of players just isn´t on an individual level, even the \*PvP focused\* ones.
---
This saying has ended my perpetual thought. What if it's on 3:10 and the real time is 6:01???? HOW DOES IT GET RIGHT TWICE A DAY DEAR GOD TELL ME IM OUT HERE SWEATING
---
Errrm. Okay. 
---
Maybe it has. But what you said isn’t a stat, and frankly it’s not compelling. You clearly have a non native English speaking narrative that hasn’t been supported by anything.
---
I don't think it's a roadblock at all except you run around telling newbros they need to train all of them first.
---
Right roughly less that 75 known moons in low vs 300+ in null. That's a disparaging difference between the two making it almost an exclusive thing to null in regards to market control.
---
&gt; So what's the difference?
---
They difference is that we should have a reasonable balance of skill and effort.
---
Not a total reliance on one side being so bad as to let their insurmountable advantage go to waste.
---
fuck the magic 14
---
Great work i loved it. Keep it up!
---
I don't think they want to just bandage up every little thing.
---
Oh gosh, we won't be able to roll our holes and will need to take a few gates. We won't be able to he lazy! Oh noes!
---
JoJo can't help with the other more traumatic ones though sadly
---
The 36h metric is pretty useless though for obvious reasons.
---
Yea, I wasn't going down that line of thought. He was. Just saying not sure if they actually track day trippers or not.
---
They said the same thing about black out hitting null. The answer was to htfu or go to high sec l. The answer was resoundingly provided by wormholers. I believe the irony here is incredible.
---
That was a long wall of text when you could just say: shove a suicide cap through a hole to close it.
---
You are purposely interchanging the word fear for the word aware. I mean, didn't you guys learn your lesson once that INIT doesn't have a single fear in regards to HK? Lol get out of here.
---
This is a good answer, actually. They are indeed not specifically aimed at something.. but more to see what works. They said that.
---
Yea, we all said that about local and every single wormholer on eve said mmmm salt. No, give it a try. So, in return.. give locked entry points a try for a few months. What could it hurt!!
---
I play with a group that includes many long time experienced players and we've been having fun constantly for years and years.
---
The changes to the game that people are whining about are some of the most exciting things to happen in years.
---
Ignore the complainers and trust your initial reaction to the game.
---
And don't read too much of the Eve Reddit...  ;)
---
I'm glad we can agree that there should be a balance. You're boiling down my argument to a too simplistic version so I'll return the favour.
---
Your argument basically becomes balance doesn't matter as long as SOME krabs can get away.
---
It says the balance should be more towards the 'shitty' hunters should still get kills instead of 'shitty' krabs should be able to get away.
---
How can you conclude anything after a couple of tests when it has rng?
---
Don't build that. Have anoms similar to now, or ded sites that you can't warp out of unless you get 300 KM away from the warp in or something. Then just make the site have more rats or smarter rats or whatever you need to encourage teamwork beyond just having a super or multiboxing domis, or kitey BS. You should ideally need a fleet to run the site, with maybe different grades of sites for different fleet comps/numbers. You would need to have the rewards work similar to incursions. Encourage having more than 1 or at least provide no reason to have fewer chars in the site up to a point.
---
Basically, PVE sucks ass atm, the optimal solution before blackout was multiboxed VNIs while you watch local to ensure you don't lose 120 mill + extra ticks every so often. Now you can't use VNI's and preventing losses is harder, more so with the cyno change coming up. I think to balance that, CCP should provide a reason to keep ratting rather than switch to mining, which is safer because you already have lots of active alts plus friends with the same. It is easy to spare an alt or two for recons or defender equipped destroyers. If you encourage group ratting, you can open it up to lower SP pilots maybe, you can keep people ratting and you can make fights happen, because instead of a solo ratting ship relying on combat ships to keep it alive, the ratting fleet is already fitted for combat. Both parties now have a fight on their hands.
---
They should just get rid of every.
---
Nice try, Hilmar!
---
You completely misread my post.
---
I am not talking about the heat in a module, but the heat in a rack. Which is acquired at a constant rate, depending on the module overheated.
---
You would need to rework the rewards, similar to incursions.
---
wow, this is awesome!
---
Yes, yes, no, no, 10552
---
Being able to buy t1 ships with t1 fit for basically market price + LP's is laughable.
---
Not sure what point  you are making in relation to my comment.
---
How exactly does this sound like a great idea? Creating bounties for structures create massive problems, since bounties on a character are deducted as % from the killed ship, if it's a single structure that has a bounty you would get the whole thing for the kill, so this will just lead to people farming ISK by destroying their own structures when the bounties outweigh the price of the structure, just like it was done by players killing themselves with alts before the bounty system was revamped.
---
Some people just like to hear themselves talk
---
Sounds like you haven't got a clue about what I want. Probably haven't got a clue about a great many other things as well...
---
After two or, or was it three intelligent response posts you had to come along...ah well. I knew the intelligent responses wouldn't last. I guess somebody had to be first. 
---
Turns out you're number 1! Naturally you're obviously used to being 
---
"number 2" so this is a whole new experience for you! Isn't that wonderful?
---
r/eve is NOT a good representation of the people who actually play Eve.
---
You could avoid posting videos about it. I mean the dude is a sperg but he isn´t wrong. There´s hardly anything worth recording happening, certainly nothing that´s worth parading around.
---
Laughed out loud.  One up doot for you.
---
Props for using real 8-bit hardware and not just using a midi soundfont, one internet for you good sir.
---
It was a pretty great change too because by the time you had 5 or so years of experience a clone would cost about 55m isk so older pilots were unwilling to fly ships that were easy to kill such as frigates or logi. With the change its much easier to get good logi numbers and bigger frig/dessie gangs out.
---
I finally found it, the one person who doesnt like the clone cost removal
---
I’d learn how the subjunctive mood works in English.
---
I would ignore all of the whining. Understand that r/eve is a vocal minority of eve players, and ones that tend to complain about literally everything.  
---
For you, its entirely possible that these changes will lead to a new and better eve than ever before. A lot of these changes have been aimed at making the game harder for long term players who, in the opinion of CCP,  have led a gameplay life that was too easy and too rewarding.  
---
The playerbase itself  has taken a minor  the last couple months, but I wouldnt let that stop you at all, August is usually the "bottom" of eve activity, as we move into fall and winter we generally see activity and players increase. CCP is making a lot of changes right now, so things are "chaotic" and it may take a couple months to really feel and see the long term effects, if they look terribl I suspect many can/will be un done.  
---
If you are having fun, keep playing, keep having fun, dont let anyone else tell you what you should or shouldnt be doing.
---
\&gt; I charge an ISK fee per month for the bot     
---
well, CCP will have a word w/ you
---
Once you block the isk doublers and scammers jita chat can be hilarious.
---
Cleeeeean.
---
Definitely has it's moments
---
Nah, why dont you go back and read the very first thing I said.
---
You got it :)
---
A good concept but the mechanics may need toying around with. A carbon copy of the player bounty system probably wouldn't  work. Maybe a contract for taking out a structure could work better because it could be a private contract. So the owner of the station couldn't cash in the bounty himself.
---
&gt; Your argument basically becomes balance doesn't matter as long as SOME krabs can get away.
---
Hardly.
---
The entire point I was making is that there should be meaningful counterplay where good decisions beat bad decisions.
---
Not once did I remotely suggest shitty hunters should be able to beat most Krabs.
---
People should have SOME home turf advantage, but that advantage should primarily be due to buffer space, and population, not all the mechanics benefiting them as individuals.
---
Black out, for example, doesn't affect home turf advantage, as local benefitted anyone out in space trying not to die as individuals with no requirement to own the space or to work with other players.
---
is it better than boku no pico
---
I actually do know what you want. You want to get laid for the first time. Let me know how it goes.
---
List of things that are bad for the game 1. Bots 2.gankers
---
so what are they going to do? if you're jumping in, you dock; jumping out, you undock and jump; inbound, if anything is on grid /dscan with you you wait till it's far enough off; vary your cyno points every time so they can't bookmark and warp there to bump you. if they have to wait for the cyno itself to warp to, you're docked before they land. if you use a player structure you don't control or trust absolutely, i can't help you and you deserve to lose your jf. for your highsec entry system, additional rules apply (no warp before align; no undock while there's a super hanging around. don't be a cheapskate and deploy your own astrahus if your corp/alliance doesn't provide one in the system you need). for traveling though highsec and not geting "coded", there are other default precautions that i'm not going to tell code, and that would exceed the scope of this reply :P
---
I did and it's silly. They can't undock because they're not there. Yup, so keep on cruising to a populated area. Nobody can ignore you derping around solo until you get to a system with people to ignore you. And you can definitely expect more people concentrating into less areas with blackout. If you want to get out and do your probing and chirping and wishing someone would chase you you'll have to go to where they are.
---
I was talking about how not to get rolled in for you guys, and no we couldn't, the groups that predominantly roam nullsec roam out of c2s which age not cap capable, if you are unable to scram off a higgs battleship or kill it before it burns through 10km of bubble. then frankly you deserve to get rolled in.
---
So yeah some serious mental gymnastics going on to avoid taking the fight if getting rolled is your main fear.
---
Well if it's not spaghetti already, it shouldn't be that hard. I'd imagine the map has a list of filters and data sources somewhere. Should just be a matter of removing the entry for the unwanted filter.
---
If it's more complex than that, it's probably beyond saving anyway.
---
im not sure how you get quite that high, occult, max skills, pyro 4, 5 faction sinks and heat is only 3300.  
---
Same fit, with these implants , now at 67 spoolup cycles, is 4901.
---
What about day trippers? Day trippers make a pittance compared to people who actually live in wormholes, sure the relic hunter made a few hundred mil (if he is lucky and/or persistent). Its fuckal compared to what you pull out of a C5/6.  Jesus, you can make 400m an hour in a c4. The isk/day trippers make is only a drop in your 12T ocean
---
I think they broke the game permanently with citadels and skill injectors. I don’t think they can walk it back. They would have to take away all of the capitals people have to fix it. And they would have to delete all of the citadels. They won’t, because people would quit over it. I think the trajectory is down long term because that is what needs fixing but you can’t fix it without going out of business.
---
The game is better off with more video content than it is with less. This dude obviously enjoyed what he did with his friends and wanted to share it and have to watch in the future, and that's a good thing.
---
:fear:
---
Why? Thats perfectly allowed
---
Why not? PVE is the backbone of the big null empires. They are the reason they got so powerful. Only makes sense for them to take good care of their ratters and miners.
---
It may not look like it from the "eLiTe pVP" perspective typically vocalised on reddit, but krabs are highly valued members of most large groups.
---
No I'm just memeing m8 just ignore me
---
I think CCP realizes the ease of 0.0 can generate so much isk and material that people aren't as pressured to sub or buy plex, which in turn hurts their goal of making $. When CCP saw complaints about skill injectors, rorqs, citadels they didn't care at all, maybe the downward trend of subs and sales is finally what made them do it.
---
Posts like yours are part of the problem mr. New player # 285712
---
Your mom was neither my first nor my last lay. She was however the first chick specifically asking me to go from her ass to her mouth without wiping it off first.
---
And as you suddenly find yourself picturing that in your mind, naturally, I wonder how quickly you'll discover, the more you find yourself imagining your mom enjoying that, the more impossible it actually is to not keep imagining that even more? 
---
And as you find that happening more, eventually you'll become aware that more you try in vain to not keep imagining your mom enjoying that, the more you'll find that happening even more. Just like when a song gets stuck in your head.
---
Brown coated cock.
---
This, also, this change in particular pisses off some really experienced players who enjoyed highsec or even better status in their regions for a long time now and it's gonna be made quite a bit harder now to execute this as there are no more invulnerable ships (yey rorqual Panic cyno) with a jump beacon for infinite friendlies to jump in but you have to actually think about if you really want to light a cyno (the jump beacon capitals can jump to) because you will most likely lose your 400 mill cyno ship for it even Vs a small gang so yeah, this is one of those gamechanging balance patches but for a new player it's an absolute great time to join imo as eve is currently on a relatively stable situation (far better than a few months ago at least where everyone and his mother was fighting over the highsec market and you wouldn't be sure if your market order that you put up at Sunday will still be there when you come back next weekend)
---
people always jump on the bandwagon praising CCP for literally every announcement they make, until it either does not make it into the game at all or ends up fucking it up in ways no one could imagine...
---
You really do need to get laid pal. It will change your perspective. Quit the porn.
---
I'm still really bummed that Blackout made it harder for subcaps to rat.
---
I don't really have the time to play the market or fat stacks saved up via poopsocking to mine in a rorqual so it was nice to be able to pay 90% attention to whatever needed doing in RL while making enough money to fund PvP ships in the one or two hours I have free in the evenings.
---
Blackout removed that option for me. I get that sometimes you just gotta realize that a game "isn't for you anymore" and that r/eve somehow thinks this is a good thing, but I'm wondering how many other players there are like me who liked EVE but who were pushed away. It just sucks that this sub doesn't recognize that problem and just downvotes people like me because we disagree with the hivemind. The devs that visit this place don't get to see opinions that may not match what the top of the comment stack thinks.
---
Who are “ most “ of these WH corps? Most likely the ones who end up getting evicted when people tire of them rolling off whenever anything PvP comes to their door.
---
Judging by Megas, they are low class.

---
WH space. Ah yes! Let’s make all space NS. A new age of everything being blob F1 combat. Sounds like an interesting and varied video game.
---
I only read the first sentence. 
---
If it's an engineering complex, they can bash it knowing there's a jump freighter worth of material being processed which will drop if the structure is bashed. 
---
This can be quite profitable.
---
Don't worry, cyno changes incoming.
---
I mean... is it so bad if a few citadels go poof?
---
True... I am thinking the monkey and typewriter type of thing no?
---
Structures aren't equivalent to ships because more than one person is using them and more than one person has their stuff in there. Imagine how pissed people would be if one of the perimeter markets tried that, or one of the nullsec trade hubs or keepstars...   
---
No one is going to put huge bounties on throwaway structures - they're going to put them on ones that make it painful for their enemies.
---
This
---
Does that mean the EULA does not apply?
---
That would explain a lot of things.
---
Yeah Eve totally died the second Code. started.  That's 100% backed up by stats from CCP.
---
The shortest answer is because we love--LOVE--this fucking game.    It's kind of like freaking out because your kid got a B instead of an A and a scholarship to Princeton, just because they are your whole world... except most of us love EVE more than our kids too.
---
okay so hardcap bounties based on size.  so the bounty cant be greater than the value of the structure... make it based in jita mean price or something.
---
Lol, your comments speak for volumes of your personality you know? I already won EVE and is just here in case I find it interesting again. And you just want EVE to be the way you like and doesn't care whether it dies. Better sink the ship if others are taking the helm?
---
My God you're a fucking pansy.
---
Sometimes its about getting to use the toys not necessarily winning the fight
---
They always seem to expect that null sec should be their personal playground. You must play with me. You must bring a certain amount of ships. You must bring a certain type of ship. And when you conform to all these demands is when you get blobbed by the rest of his friends. I have other things to do.
---
I think its impossible to make that argument without having a look in detail on CCP finances. 
---
I think based on the market the only thing we can assume is that the demand for plex is still there, and may have increased over the years due to skins and skill extractors.
---
Also skill injectors or rorquals, or even citadels are not the cause of the problem, they all contribute to accelerate the pace in which we arrived in this situation, but they didn't caused it, Eve online was going to reach this point when it came to titan proliferation at some point regardless, it would only take a bit longer for us to get here.
---
And again about the downward trend of subs and sales, its impossible to make that argument without looking at ccp's balance book. Subs definitely fell, but sales, who knows, they must look pretty decent for PA to decide to buy them.
---
your rude ass has no place here tho, the fuck you're doing here?
---
You are right they should have nano the dreads and kite avatar...
---
charging isk fees is fine, you just can't charge real money fees
---
The same thing happens in lowsec. Dumbs take the bait and then get popped by the three or four friends they didn't expect and get butt hurt. Nobody else is obligated to come out and 1v1 or feed to some nerd in local and they definitely aren't going to waste their time chasing around a single sub cap. I'm not sure where the entitlement comes from.
---
You could, to some extent say that about a whole range of skills. Basically use skills only as a tool to gate people from what they're not ready to use. Whoever the skill system is a big part of what makes EVE what it is today so they shouldn't go about that lightly.
---
Have you calculated all the daytrippers to wh space in your "small population" metrics?
---
Ya, just one. 19 accounts
---
The plan failed, but was not forgotton.
---
So the feeling now is that if the NIP allows Legacy to target strat assets like our supercaps, then it allows us to poke a mining rorq or two.
---
Sure, it looked like tons of fun. But the video makes it seem like they killed everything and got out. When in fact this POV was only 1 of the 6 caps that survived from Origin. The other 34 perished.
---
fuck i should tell brax hk disbanded, i don't think he's aware of it

Actually PCU has been dropping all year mate.
---
[If you narrow the slider to 2019 only](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility) you'll see the PCU is declining steadily, and the Blackout barely stands out. If you isolate 2018 to present you'll note that PCU is barely maintaining a roughly flat line, until January 2019 when the bans start and it begins to decline steadily.
---
Now before you get your jimmies rustled, note that I am *not* claiming that the Blackout and recently announced changes did not contribute to the recent dip in PCU - *however*, it's August. In any given year PCU for EVE Online drops between June and September. Some years it's more and some years it's less, but historically most MMO's see a decline in players over the summer. We'd have to wait until early October and even then, a statistically analysis of variance of variances would be needed.
---
lool.  Try again.  I remember when you had to launch probes in-space in-location one at a time.  The probes didn't warp around, you did.

Agreed. I think more importantly, it may be better if CCP can somehow make EVE into a game that doesn't require long sessions but can be played with fragmented times. The mobile game would have been great if it was a real client, as a lot of people I know would love to do their logistics during their commute.
---
Oops. Lol, damn I'm retarded.

Thanks for the tips. I’ll must make a fitting for it to see how it will worm out.

Friendly reminder that the aura tutorial does this for the very first hour or so. And then it suddenly stops and you have to start using the horrid 2003-style career agents.

Seriously, the aura tutorial *is so damn good*, but it is way too short.
---
I think a lot of people are just entitled by nature. CCP needs to take a look at low sec and fix that. Actually give these people something to do there. Instead of trying to force a different playstyle on nullsec. Or perhaps you can't satisfy them. They could already choose to shoot each other or duel on the Jita undock but they don't.

More importantly it seems you have stage 4 dinobrain.

It's not a roadblock, but it sure is wasting three months of training time that could be spent training ships or weapon skills.

Got to agree. Don’t measure Eve by what you read on Reddit.

It’s why I’m hooked.

I think the most inportant in this game is content. My content is players. When i see that i lost 80% of the player where i live for pvp (system that i camp), I m sad because i lost many fight/hr. Losing player is bad for my entertainement and the health of game. What is hard to understand here?

I was surprised to see that people still undock to PvE. Hopefully the cyno changes will fix that.
---
Remove local from all of eve. Make newbie systems newbie friendly. Citadels if not used more like no fuel added after few weeks afg citadels it shuts down no timers.
---
It's also less necessary.
---
In a lot of cases, beam lasers are better for PvE. When running missions, the NPC's fly in a straight line at you, so if you're engaging them from long range, you will have very little trouble tracking them. However, once the Damaviks and Kikimoras get close, you would have trouble tracking them with beam lasers. Normally, your best way to deal with small ships in this case would be to use light drones, but because drones have a number of penalties in invaded systems, I would use pulse lasers since they have better tracking than beam lasers.
---
If most were pretty good for the game we would have went from a growing player count from the start to 2010,2011up to 60k+ players to drop inbetween then to 2013 where it goes back up to 60k+ players and then drops with only a couple of spikes in player numbers all the way down with a mighty slope to current under 30k players and going by the slope it's going to keep going that way.
---
Yay? (I don’t know what this does)
---
YOU said wormholers just dock and dont fight. when in fact its the opposite. nullbears just rolling away in sigils as soon as they can...
---
how am i beeing salty? i just said, that THIS change wouldt contribute to the current ''make eve dangerous''. it would make wormholes an extremely safe krab heaven. and noone wants that.
---
lets be honest. nullbears like you dont care at all about these changes.. you just cheer for it because in your eyes, the 'bad wormholers'' are the ''reason'' for blackout...
---
It is significantly more complicated than that.  
---
For example, an Abaddon has:  
---
High Rack Heat Capacity: 100  
---
High Rack Heat Attenuation: 0.82  
---
High Rack Heat Dissipation: 0.01  
---
Heat Generation Multiplier: 5  
---
I am working from memory here, but iirc:  
---
100 / ( 1 + 0.01 * 5 ) = ~5.7% Heat Cycle 1  
---
94.34 / ( 1 + 0.01 * 5 ) = ~11 Heat Cycle 2  
---
A tengu has a Heat Generation Multiplier of 0.75.
---
Of course EVE is dying, but there is a difference between dying, and dead. The game now struggles hitting 25k people, daily. Last year it struggled maintaining 30k, daily... etc.
---
It will probably last 5-6 more years at least, eventually profits will be 000 though, then CCP pulls the plug.
---
yay I'm that hecate scraming that hound.
---
Maybe they're lying and what they really want is to be able to kill defenceless miners with less and less restrictions like they're doing Gods work? Which would explain why they always end up shooting at the miners. Gasp.
---
"EVE is dying" has been a constant state of being ever since 2003.07.30 19:45:00 https://eve-search.com/thread/22860-0#8
---
It will be the constant state of being for unforeseen future too.
---
Don't mind it. Enjoy the ride.
---
that works if you take a (even fresh) alt, sell the Plex there and then transfer isk
---
Some of the sub are discontent with recent updates, I would say most of the sub actually likes the recent ones. The citadel patch was not recent and is widely regarded as the root cause of many issues in Eve today (super proliferation, skill injectors, nullsec stagnation, etc)
---
No shit.. I feel you read like 2 comments, got triggered and replied with out reading anything else.  I understand how WH mechanics work. My comparison which you seemed to miss was that if we in null have to move around to systems to get our pve, wormholes would have to do the same if holes became unrollable. You would have to venture in the chain for content.
---
And we've solved the mystery. Solid work here team!
---
And here i was thinking eve was a hard game...
---
what i described won't reduce the number of citadels it will merely give the holders of those structures yet another way of profiting off of them by killing them and then replacing with a new structure at a profit.
---
Pretty much what I would have guessed.  
---
Blackout just forced the majority of Rorquals to shift to Miner II.  Sure a lot less ISK, but the same low APM gameplay. 
---
With much less profit, I will be interested on the effects of the cyno changed on Rorquals.  My guess is that it will cut things in half again or more, but time will tell.
---
Agreed agreed. It’s their job. However this just has a feeling of urgency. 
---
I mean Seagull has been gone what, 2 years already? More? It’s been quiet, quiet....then bam! Chaos fuckers!
---
And actually his stated goals are fucking noble indeed. His actions just seem bumbling at best. And people can toot their horns about improvements, and chaos, htfu, adapt or die, but if were honest with ourselves and each other, empirical evidence is telling us that his actions are having the opposite effect of his stated goals.
---
Never not take bait
---
that part is totally wrong though cos it doesn't count in the trillions over trillions made out of escalations. At average, you get like double to triple the amount of isk out of the high tier nullsec sites than just bounties due to ded sites, factoring that in, it's around 80-90 trill pve towards 12 trill wormhole
---
It's a fine time to start playing - if you're the right kind of player that the type of game EVE Online is going to turn into will find appealing.
---
EVE Online has become a Candy Crush themepark, but will slowly return to it's glory days when things weren't as safe, things required work and planning, and people died everywhere all the time.
---
They can do this already now? Except bounties might encourage people to shoot citadels which is otherwise a thankless job
---
eh with the wealth that most big entities have they'll just go from 1 keepstar in their home/staging system to 5
---
People just care so much about eve its why they get worked up.
---
Think of all the ops going out. A fleet of Feroxes/Muninn/Eagles dying and you can’t reship. The meta have to change dramatically if that was implemented.
---

Not all wormholes need to be scanned.
---
Even that is utter horse shit. Next step down that road is suddenly you can't undock your rifter without 1x plex inject. Fuck that - you buy the ship, it's yours.
---
Hmm, I did not know ships had their own heat multipliers.
---
I was using a thorax
---
HeatAttenuationHi: 0.7099999785423279

All the ships have a heat capacity hi/me/lo of 100.
---
OK. So it works on all NPCs, but since it only supplies energy when the nos user is at a capacitor level lower than  the target. Does NPC ship size factor in? Rarely being neuted to zero by NPC, but wondering if I could use my unused high utility slot to have a nos to supply enough for a gtfo warp in an emergency. Not trying to use it as a basis for any major defense/offense.
---
Wish I could have heard Test audio as the scrambled to kill us only to realize Goons moonwalked home.
---
I wish I could upvote this twice.
---
Isk destroyed didn't really change.
---
&gt; It might even fix Fax being so oppressive in WHs. They can't make for good subcap logi if they can't lock subcaps in a timely fashion.
---
the only reason why FAXes can lock so quickly is because the triage module gives a big scan res buff, without it the thing takes forever to lock anything below a battleship
---
So what kind of information is relevant to you?
---
Are you having fun playing?
---
Yes - it's not a waste of time playing.
---
No - it may be a waste of time playing unless you think it'll become fun.
---
I could not make it through the whole blog post. Blue on black with sometimes triple, double, or single spaces between sentences is just terrible to read. On top of that the first two paragraphs are long but not saying a lot. The third then digresses into an unfocused discussion about the astero vs covert ops. A bit strange in a post that is about magic 14 according to the title.
---
Hey now! I resemble that remark!
---
Respecting the hardware limitations is what makes it sound good. Actually even the Sunesis you see in the animation should be compatible with the NES video chip. I used colours from the NES palette only, and respected the "1 4-colour palette for each 16x16 block". Although it is by no means efficient; so making an actual game with those assets (both the music and the graphics) would be somewhat difficult, and there is a lot of optimisation to be done if they were to be used to make a full game.
---
Buts what they said about 32bit I'm sure if we survive until 292,277,026,596 AD actually I think physics predicts the heat death of the universe by then so we're all good.
---
sounds like a good idea until people just work around this by dropping an ungodly amount of keepstars in a system
---
RMT?
---
This basicly makes creating (usually in this case) discord bots and generally 3rd party applications in nodejs easier when using the eve api
---
Have the rats scram instead of point.  Then the Nestor’s/rattles won’t all MJD away when the baddies appear.
---
I think a better suggestion would be to add activity timers to the wh, no activity then they roll themselves quicker, though some do roll for safety in c6 space im under the impression much more people roll to find other player content
---

i bet that avatar didn't even consent to pvp!
---
You're assuming a small gradual improvement on EVE would translate to increased playerbases.
---
You forget that there are other games out there that may attract people more, including lots of great space games.
---
There's no capital kills, no 40 dread yeeting on a titan, but there was a pretty fun fight where Frat just kept sending in the bois, and we kept chewing through them. Just wanted to make another video since I hadn't done a fleet one in a while. Shit on me for my flying (multiboxing our only sabre was really ass), IT MAKES ME HARDER.
---
Hah, I missed that. If that's really the case, I get where you're coming from.
---
was it your raven tat got killed? how did it make you feel
---
Honestly it comes down to bandwidth for the user.  Less things to manage tends to be a happier time.  Yes larger targets will have a larger cap, but it's still going to be 100 percent full.  So yes, they can act as batteries, but usually not worth the time.

(Some Incoming Deep Shit)
---
Ill give you a different type of answer, that actually can answer the same question for most other games like this. (High grind/time commitment/real money can purchase in game stuff).
---
Because for some people, they play games to relax or escape from real life for a bit. When games become as grueling as real life, through grind, sudden loss, massive time commitments to advance very little, it becomes difficult to escape and feel any less frustration than one does with their rl struggles.     When you scrape together a bit of extra money to pay for something that you want to enjoy, being reminded how broke you are and having it rubbed in, no matter which way it comes, sucks.
---
That's the answer i came to for myself anyways, and i doubt im alone in this. Sad part is i havent been struggling for a while but i just can't, not get mad at some point, when i end up picking up one of these games that basically goes back and picks at those old wounds of mine by trying to make me waste all this time to get nowhere. I remember when they felt like an equalizer, but they definitely don't to me anymore. if anything they are an even more start reminder of wealth disparity, considering even when ive lived around people who are wealthier than me they generally dont have 50 times as many cars as me or just 100 times the size of mine or wearing copious amounts of bling, or somehow using their wealth to dominate or iratate me in regular ways, and im much happier as i play them less and less.
---
I remember being really good at the eve markets and earning a shit ton of isk flipping items across regions, and now i fuck with stocks in rl and have way more fun and am better off for it. And me being not broke now is only more motivation to not pay these companies cause im not fond of gold diggers in real life so why would i want to embrace that kind of thing in a fake one? 
---
This is definitely not unique to EVE but its part of that group for me at least. I will say this though, of all the games ive played like that, i probably least regret EVE out of the bunch, simply because their the one game accounts of mine that retained the most value when i eventually sold them for bill/rent money, so that really got me out of some binds. I must have had like 7-9 accounts over the years and usually managed to get a few hundo back on them, so theres that.

---
it makes too much sense... to get hilmar to actively implement something it has to be on the crazy side and unreasonable
---
If I was Hillmar I would look at my long streak of failures and at my one hit that only grew while I was hands off. I would realise that I struck lightening in a bottle and back off. 
---
My strategy would be to hire a lead designer with the balls to tell me "no" and has a history of extending the life of games.
---
I would base no decisions on a 120 man subreddit.
---
Ccp sucks utterly at balance. The game philosophy was to be a sandbox, instead of working with players who know the aspects of the game that are "abused" they decided to step in as an actor in the sandbox. Removing multiple playstyles from the game entirely. I would not reccomand eve to people in a situation where the viable playstyles are taylored down to a few streamlined "professions".
---
I am in this comment and I don't like it.
---
Yeah thats what I thought too. Else I'd be in trouble big time (I run a tool called Eve-Gatecheck)
---
pretty sure it looks like this 
---
http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/DumpsterFire2.jpg
---
Was it ever?
---
Done.
---
I would say that adding at least rigs value to that limit would be possible without breaking the system; bounty is divided in some way between those that killed each layer of defense (like 20% shileds, 30% armor and 50% structure as an example), some % might even go to a "bounty tax" isk sink or something; and unanchoring cancels the bounty giving the ones that placed it their money back.
---
you. i like you.
---
Probably used 'buy all' on your hecate fit from zkill
---
It makes sense. Thank you for your time to lay it out for me 👍
---
Hey the editing wasn't bad man. I'm curious when you say "faction" keepstar do you mean palentine? I only ask because I hadn't heard any of those had actually been made yet, granted I just got back from like a year long break but still, I thought that would have been bigger news.
---
If you didn't say it, I sure as hell was going to say it.
---
Oh, and I would not hire a bunch of low sec, and WHers and wonder "why does no one understand null?"
---
*** Confused Pikachu***
---
Two ideas.
---
1. Diminishing returns for repetitive activity. Hit them in the wallet.
---
2. Make drones more like fighters to require actual effort.
---
Lol ya.
---
Why do certain people feel the need to randomly add "Unpopular thought / opinion / etc" to the beginning of their posts? Are you so insecure that you feel the need to apologize for your post before making it?
---
We'll decide for ourselves what we do or do not like; we don't need you to tell us what is going to be popular or unpopular with us.
---
Yeah, and the replacent cost of a structure is less than the cost of assaulting one.
---
That's one of the reasons why structure spam is a thing.
---
About a decade ago?
---
there were at some point a story to the tutorial, where you were shown a NPC fleet ready to take on the bad guys (AWE for new player) and you experienced your first death ot become a capsuleer. Is it still there ? it 's a pretty good basis. Add in some "join the fleet lead by a npc", "here is a logi, and how to use it", "don't go there this is low sec ... ho shit we need to go there" that's would be good
---
Why would you not use the keepstar. Tests enemies tried to kill it, we could not. We are now paid to not shoot and even protect it interests.
---
The keepstar for high sec dudes is safe as houses.
---
1 isk bounties and you have even more unwanted structures in space.
---
I don't have solutions but it seems clear to me that players have very little reason to actually go and try and kick over each other's sandcastles these days.
---
One more time daddy.
---
Started playing a couple days ago, would ve happy to play with you!
---
you explained it better than i wouldve, kudos to you
---
no u
---
I'm in australia so I've been told the input lag might come from here too, but moving the cube around shouldn't lag. I've got a X240 laptop and fps aren't great, they get worse as time goes on.
---
I admit I have a shitty mouse, to say my bias. Now saying none of my arguments hold weight because I showed my bias isn't fair.
---
Only if pando does all the work and you come to press f1, fuckwit.
---
I've always liked the idea of upkeep costs for the biggest toys in the game. That would honestly solve the problem if executed correctly.
---
I think he's talking about actual fps and input lag and not probe warping time.
---
I think "the agency" helped a lot, but I'd do more to better guide new players. It's certainly a far cry better than it was when I started (do career agents then good luck) but still needs a bit of work.
---
Honestly, they need to focus on. We players and retaining them, which is a tall order for a game like EVE.
---
You realize that they are pre aligned to a warp out point right?
---
MMO's as a genre are generally in trouble. Subscription based MMOs are faring even worse. Eve is not immune to this, but it's doing better than most.
---
agility has nothing to do with it
---
bombers that launch and immediately warp were aligned before decloaking
---
I think this would be a great post in https://old.reddit.com/r/evetech/
---
So why is ratting bad
---
1) Make business decisions for business reasons, not because some vocal bunch of wankers are bitching about something or other.
---
2) Never do anything for any reason other than it has a PROBABILITY of maintaining or preferably increasing the LONG TERM bottom line. PROBABILITY, not POSSIBILITY. LONG TERM. Quick bucks don't last.
---
3) Refer to items 1) and 2)
---
That is all.
---
I use the arrow because I missed the small cube. Remove the arrows then, but using them is annoying and that's why I mentioned it. 
---
"But there's a workaround" isn't very useful to say because I know there's a work around. I'm just saying it could be very easily allow a non-annoying arrow usage. Just make the cube bigger too.
---
DELETE THIS!
---
Shotgun the first 2 dimensions, then click the arrow to make 1d precise quickly
---
&gt;I admit I have a shitty mouse, to say my bias. Now saying none of my arguments hold weight because I showed my bias isn't fair. But I don't have any issue with the mouse outside of eve. Clicking on save here is without any delay or lag.
---
Ouch. You need a hug, friend?
---
You realize that nullsec ratting happens in anomalies, which do not require combat probes to find or warp to, right?
---
With local gone, you have all the time in the world to check the anomalies and find the ratting VNI without ever decloaking or launching probes.
---
The VNI's first sign of danger would be the fact that he's already tackled by a bomber and one or more T3Cs/other bombers are decloaking on top of him. There's no play and counterplay, and skill doesn't come into play on either side; it's simply a couple of cloakies claiming one of the free kills that CCP has decided they are entitled to.
---
Can’t you just get a split from someone in your fleet/corp then?
---
to your 1)
---
&gt;I also use the mousewheel,
---
to your 2)
---
&gt;There are also buttons to change scanning angle from top or side. 
---
Is this really an argument against? I mean, what exactly is wrong is asking CCP to add a shortcut? Is it because I have a shitty mouse? That's not sound logic.
---
Another dumb nullbear super umbrella dweller
---
&gt; There's no capital kills, no 40 dread yeeting on a titan
---
And theirs little proper grammer, to boot.
---
Agreed. The more the merrier. I will never not upvote titans dieing.
---
Not a wormholer huh?
---
I might ask in a ticket, that's a real workaround. Thank you!
---
That's exactly what you said
---
Says the individual who started a sentence with "And."
---
I think not allowing a bomber to warp or cloak after they launch a bomb for a short period of time would be a good change.
---
&gt;works on my end
---
&gt;that's a problem with you
---
Why are you so defensive?
---
Never touch working system or it will break. Right, have you read any devblogs? Have you seen how many changes there is per patch?
---
Thank you for your input.
---
Post on forums not here
---
Just to increase decrease right? Yeah I've set those up, they weren't there a few years ago. We're getting there!
---
So, let me get this straight. You want a class of paper tank frigates that rely on cloak and burst damage and align like slow cruisers to actually align like battlecruisers? Seems legit.
---
You are kind person to prove his point so readily.
---
I'm not being cheap I just bought the first mouse I found when I arrived around, I already have a great mouse at home. The mouse works fine for clicking outside of eve.
---
The csm is garbage, it s a bunch of people who have zero introcate knowledge about game mechanics other than the tiny sphere around the playstyle they are engaged in. Its like last year brisc rubal holding the wardec changes discord with the aid of materall carneros and ronusmsc. 4 total idiots in the reality of wardecs debating the merits of specific changes. Give me a break.
---
Absolutely,
---
But for a great amount of us, this Reddit aids in getting that hype going. It needs cool content and not just that handful of power posters. Else it does affect people.
---
Also keep in mind how many newbies check Reddit and other sources for info. Us shitting on CCP non stop does not entice them to stay
---
I'd like every kind of non-mining PVE reward a mix of isk and commodities. An isk baseline, and a commodity reward that adjusts itself if the activity is too zerged, with the nature of the commodity depending on the expected size of the activity.
---
Right click, jump to, ctrl click, f1, siege green, siege red, jump to. Fucking elite! Thanks for the video.
---
Just as much as there are delusional idiots that refuse to see anything further than what they can spit upon.
---
You are wrong, the game is literally unplayable without that 3% agility boost.
---
I hope you see how condescending you are. Read your message.
---
&gt;I've had a shitty life so don't complain about yours, don't try to improve yours, respect me for some unknown reason
---
Hey we got it, you're against change, you dislike good UI. You think a shitty, unintuitive interface is complex and challenging! Guess what, you're actually challenged. Go dial a number by shouting at it, donate all your money because some broke all his bones this morning. How you good you've got it cowboy.
---
Hope this break your illusion that you're old and respectable. Spouting shit like that you only look like a fool.
---
Because you're just happy to be here.
---
This is amazing haha
---
no
---
You're right about it not being useless now, but "slightly worse at one thing"? 
---
Maybe in the situation of someone with great hybrid skills fighting rats that are weak to kin/therm and don't jam or tracking disrupt (meaning serpentis), you could describe it as "slightly worse" at ratting...but that generally isn't the case, since it was primarily a newbro ship. Newbros lost, among other things, 40% of their drone dps in exchange for other bonuses that were of little or no use to them (unless their coalition doctrines happened to revolve around hybrids, I guess).
---
Maybe it was a good change and maybe it was an overreaction, but it definitely wasn't a "slight" nerf.
---
&gt; Why don't we make signatures automatically reveal themselves while we're at it?
---
translated as
---
&gt;Why don't I make a hyperbole to prove I'm missing the point and making a fool out of myself?
---
A very convincing move, just after trying to belittle OP.
---
Just trying to help you show you how moronic your messages sound, have a nice day.
---
reddit is just the shit post play of eve online.
---
do you think before posting?
---
Or buff defender missiles
---
Tofu costs literally nothing to produce, just convince the new generation males to switch to it and hand their wives to a BBC and you will be printing money.
---
Its a chaotic time.
---
A lot of people are *very* happy with the changes. Others are *very* unhappy. All about who you talk to.
---
Eve is like anal, we love it but we complain nonstop about the implications.
---
Wow. You need serious help bro. And definitely some sort of human contact.
---
R/eve is mostly just a big bloc alliance called test. Some are goons though. Basically you’re reading the voices of a bunch of crabs the aren’t happy that a lot of these changes don’t help them pve more. Their way of life is being shaken at its cores and this reddit is their response to that. Eventually they will adapt. Also, I’m probably going to get downvoted into oblivion for this post so I guess I’ll cya on the other side!
---
Correct, I am aware that probes have a travel speed, most of my lag was looking at the FPS in the fps window
---
Do you?
---
I am aware of travel time, I am talking about experiencing a spike in frame time and a drop in fps
---
I'm assuming non retarded decisions would maybe stem the amount of people leaving, maybe even encourage people to stay if ccp was far more clear on what it is trying to achieve other than "greed is good". There are many mmo's that are good but that doesn't mean anything as we don't know why people leave other than ccp does retarded shit.
---
It's not hard for them to actually pull their finger out there ass and go "Look guys, we've fucked up, we've made many many many bad decisions, from getting rid of a community team to introducing retarded ships and features that you guys never wanted and we want to try and fix this" and then for them to actually step forth without fingers up their arse or in there ears and so for themselves that they have MASSIVE historic problems (they stem from the top down fyi) and fix their fucking shit.
---
Ah yes, eve sure loves its Ad Hominems
---
I see you too are envious of our FCs.
---
bring back cruise missle launcher for bomber.
---
The good boi bomber. :)
---
first, yes, bombers are already prealigne when using bomb launchers, so.... 
---
Then, was'nt there already a nerf on bomber some time back ? I specifically remember that seeing wingspan being dumb and solo hunting with bomber got me into this game. By the time I could sit in one and try this, solo hunting in bombers was kind of dead ( :'( )
---
&gt; Should definitely be nerfed.
---
why is that? 
---
If jspace is so OP lucrative and as safe as ya'll want to paint it, why is is not super crowded? Most wormholes are no inhabited, come, set up shop and profit off of it.
---
Asked myself the same questions a month ago, but it turned out super fun, the game is salty tho..at least they say so
---
And...never write anything to wormholle local, it is dangerous ;)
---
Fair point the Pre- align, ok.  if you warp or cloak, the bombs should do zero damage. 
---
 the current bomber meta allows them to align, de-cloak, launch bomb and warp so quickly they insta-warp.  resulting in Zero risk to the bombers while being able to deal significant damage to the target.  Such risk adverse (safe Pvp)  is ruining our game.  there should be risk to both bombers and their target. and at present there is no risk to bombers doing bombing runs and running away
---
I understand that you’re upset. What I don’t understand is how you can be so impervious to logical reasoning.
---
If we don't adress his screeching, someone may think he's having good ideas because he's got no oposition.
---
I wouldn't fuck with something which is defended by multiple major NullBlocs.
---
&gt;Gamer who started playing a game that was advertised as a sandbox where many playstyles were facilitated, only to have the playstyle he'd invested his time/isk/sp into suddenly rendered infeasible by heavy-handed nerfs detected. 
---
Fixed that for you.
---
Now, I'm all for ridiculing other people for their stupidity when they're obnoxious about it, but if you're going to do that, you should REALLY make sure YOU fully understand what you're talking about. 
---
Trying to mock someone when you clearly have only the most basic idea of what they're talking about only makes you look stupid.
---
Yeah, those hotkeys make scanning doable fot longer. Else it feels soooooooo cumbersome
---
That’s exactly what a bombing run is!  What they are supposed to sit there and stare at you ?
---
&gt;  You'd see relatively! less ratting and relatively more mining.
---
It can't be emphasized how much difference PANIC makes. With max skills, PANIC gives a 7 minute timer for the reinforcement fleet to arrive, which means Rorquals and Rorquals only can tank a sizable gank fleet long enough for friendly caps to mid once and still arrive in time to save the the fleet.
---
We've occasionally saved Rorquals that were outside of supercap jump range but titans and supers always ate shit if they were too far out.
---
You mean devolve.
---
It sucks that if you hit the hotkey while you're clicking on the probe, it glitchs out, sometime putting the probes back where they were
---
The local blackout and cyno changes are definitely aimed at helping new players.
---
Yeah, it spent a lot of time on niche recommendations and explanations for an article purportedly aimed at folks who don't know what to train in general yet.
---
speaking for traditional NPCs not sure about sleepers, triglavians, or ♦npcs 
---
Nos works just like it does on player ships the main issue is that NPCs are largely based on some very old stats so their cap levels are typically smaller than on comparably sized player ships.  Since you can only nos with less cap than your target this usually means you won't get much from most NPCs, and imo generally makes fitting a nos on a pve ship not worthwhile. 
---
many players say NPCs have infinite cap but that's wrong. I think they say this mostly because NPC actions are independent of cap, they mostly have a straight up rng roll on if they activate their tank mods,  and they use their guns no matter what. 
---
you can see NPC ship stats here: http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/npc_ships.php
---
Their ideas are intriguing when they don’t have Daddy FCs hand up their ass to puppet their thoughts.
---
What a stupid post
---
No. i expect them to have  risk in order to kill their target. just like everything else.
---
&gt;In specific Titan-only "drydocks" that you have to build so that everyone knows where your Titans are
---
This was actually in the original concept art for Citadels, and was discussed by the devs as a possibility (visual indicators for Titans docking, etc.)
---
Problem was how would you visually display 40,000 Titans docked in a Keepstar?
---
As a new player I think agility is not really nessessary. Makes aligning to sound thing easier but not 100% must. But the ships feel really slow. How do I make them move really fast?
---
Sounds like bait
---
Meh. Well executed bomb runs are one of the most efficient tools smaller groups have vs big groups and even this is countered well enough by defender missiles, micro jump drives and smart bombs.
---
Or people that don't have the time to invest their life into the game. People like myself have been playing for some time, and slowly life is catching up. The worst part is that the game is becoming more of a chore for me, so its a matter of time of when. 
---
Not everyone who wins eve do it out of rage.
---
I realize this is something of a cliche and is often used in situations where it doesn't actually apply, but...
---
Have you considered playing a single-player game?
---
You sound like you VASTLY overestimate your own importance and have grossly unrealistic expectations about how much CCP or the rest of the playerbase cares about you, your desires, and your "rules".
---
You'd probably be much happier (and less annoying) in a game where you were the only player and things really DID revolve around you.
---
Do they? Why not challenge them and make your own list? 
---
Oh wait, you are just bitching. Move along, little man.
---
WTF did I just read ?
---
Every day, hour, minute, we are all getting closer to death, so we are dying. Doesn't mean we're about to drop dead tomorrow!
---
The game is awesome.  In part because *this* community is pretty vocal about things they don't like.  We all have invested too much time into the game to just "log off and play WoW or something".  
---
Having said that - /r/eve represents a specific, vocal minority of the community.  Reading it for entertainment is perfectly fine.  To get a feel about the health of the game probably not.
---
So what have you not noticed about the image inside your mind of your mom with the
---
Again, you mention ratters, not PvP people. Who cares if they log off if they weren't your target?
---
How do you miss the cube? When angled directly at a face the arrow disappears
---
But you don't need that much precision
---
Great, I hope it happens. Dead supers is always a good thing, even if there's no killmail.
---
If you think it's fun, do it. If not then don't
---
Part of their risk mitigation is coordinating a warp out point and doing a proper bombing set up. They fuck that up they are easy pickings. Of course you want them to just sit there and wait to die though.

---
No it doesn't.  He's very much retarded.
---
Yea every few years I forget the details and have to figure them out again haha.  After checking my old notes:
---
Heat = 1 - e ^ ( -t * HeatGenerationMultiplier * ModuleHeatDissipationRate )
---
So for a compact TC, 10s cycle, 0.01 mod, 2 cycles:  
---
1 - e ^ (-20 * 0.75 * (0.01) ) = 0.139 Heat.
---
Cooling happens only when no active modules in the rack are heated:  
---
CurrentHeat * e ^ (-t * HeatDissipationRate) = Next Heat
---
No it isn't back to serving burgers for you.
---
Funny how that's how it works for people living in WHs, and we've survived.
---
You should go outside more.
---
Wut?
---
unidentified wormholes to the drifter holes.  
---
Are you new or something?
---
not only sizeable, pretty much infinite
---
For as long as it took to think up and write that 
---
YOU revolved around me.
---
Yeah well the border allows for ratting in supers, doesn't it?
---
Yes but ocd
---
You have obviously never tried to create a doctrine for your corp or alliance. If you don't have a baseline of skills to build from, you will either end up with a lot of people not being able to fit properly, or your doctrine will be defeated by same ships that are better fit.
---
The Magic 14 makes it so when that player does skill into that new shiny ship or gun they can actually fit it properly.
---
I thought you were talking about a 'Wor**l**d Bank' for a sec and was ready to start selling pitchforks heh.
---
I promise it’s not. Can’t join my alliance because we’re war eligible. We started unanchoring it but someone attacked 6 hours before it finished. We’re trying to rejoin the alliance so I need to get rid of it .
---
&gt; Rorquals finally begin to be acceptable.
---
Like hell they are. They were supposed to be support ships, not outright miners. Nothing was supposed to be able to out-mine a hulk. 
---
And PANIC buttons are stupid, unless it's a support ship.
---
Upvoting twice just makes you twice as dumb.
---
If it had the same effect as NSA's did on carriers that'd be interesting. 
---
It'd also produce a vast amount of salt. 
---
Tbh I'm not sure that's the right nerf, but I do think cloaked cowardice should have a counter.
---
You realize you're talking about EVE, right? It doesn't matter how good your ratting ship is at pvp when the prospective gankers choose whether or not a fight happens, and there are no limits to the size or number of ships they can bring to that fight.
---
In the past, flying a ship that was good at pvp could be something of a deterrent and reduce the frequency of ganks, but now there are too few ~~free killmails~~ ratters in space and too many ~~idiots looking for the easy killmails that they were promised with the blackout~~ elite pvpers looking for good fights, so...
---
That's true. But we could increase that lock time even further couldn't we. Perhaps reduce the number of locks so they can't just prelock everything in small gang. So technically a subcapital fleet won't ever beat a sizeable super blob. But the supers are too inefficient at clearing subs without subcapital support. Especially when they can just warp off to break that lock again.
---
XD, can’t rejoin the alliance because we’re war eligible. I’ve tried everything. Wingspan hasn’t found it yet because it’s a dead wormhole and no one is scanning out the holes from inside. Some douchebag attacked it with 6 hours to finish unanchoring and i messaged him and told it to finish it off and he said “na.”
---
So, if you run across it, i’ll give it away. We’ve been out of the alliance for 2 weeks now.
---
Me too, thats why I said we. :)
---
Market trading is fun when nobody else thinks it is.
---
That's exactly what a master baiter would say
---
You mean you don't find market ~~pve~~ "PvP" versus ~~0.01 isking bots~~ other keen minded players such as yourself fun?
---
Part of the reason supers aren’t efficient is because the current subcap meta is either muninns or eagles which can just MWD or Boosh away
---
Lol, taking credit for showing up after months of a small group of doing the work for you. Gg, go press f1 for pap link.
---
do you think we will be able to walk around the station and talk to all our friends now?
---
They mentioned updating the eve portal app so you can change skills etc via that recently.
---
That's a change I'd actually 100% support.
---
I have been making good money doing exploration for nullsec relic sites in my Astero lately.  When I’m out there, I come across lots of scannable combat sites.  I hear that these can be quite lucrative, but I am having a hard time understanding which sites are meant to be done in which size/style of ship.  Is there a handy chart or something out there that compares site ratings to compatibleor recommended ships?
---
I guess a second question would be “Are there any combat sites I can do in my Astero or Stratios without reshipping?”
---
About what?
---
The original plan... the one that started it all... the OG. I still get nerd boners when I see these. Wish I had known about the game then and also had myself a copy. Cheers!
---
Market bots are unironically taking isk out of the game at least, where as the ratting ones are sucking at the faucet with inhuman ability.
---
Are you seriously asking for instant travel? 
---
Holy shit, where did all this cancer come from.
---
you ever heard of bubbles? hics? destroyers? frigates? literally anything that can shoot back?
---
*Crickets*  
---
Just like eve will be when the only people playing live in high sec and wormholes.
---
This^^^
---
Setting up a bomb run requires good communication and planning, especially with bubbles around.  And people screw it up all the time and get wrecked.
---
Bomber balances should focus on the Stuka/Goku fleets in my opinion, there bombing part is great.
---
Real money trade/transaction, aka buying ISK from goldfarmers
---
How would you "revisit" it? making it warp to 0?
---
PERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRKELE
---
As in like, if you like 3 dreads that can come out of a hole, a super or a titan can tank that for a very long time and quite likely kill a few in retaliation with DD/Fibos. 3 Dread is not fightable unless you have over a dozen rorqs.
---
Even something like 50 Kikis can be tanked for over 10 minutes by a Super/Titan, whereas they'd chew up rorqs. It's when blops fleets of over 100 bomber or a dozen dreads that come in that Rorqs can tank harder.
---
Imagine comparing local removal to removing rolling holes. Because removing intel is tottaaaaaallllly the same thing as changing the fundamental geography of space. 
---
CLEARLY you're a wormhole master. 
---
Maybe you should go back to ratting, people who actually understand mechanics are talking.
---
No I again am just not going to do your work for you.    Wow you are not bright and love to conflate.  
---
&gt; Eat shit child rapist.

Wow you are a really terrible human being.

R/evejobs

Mostly go: magic 14, definitely 5.   
---
Main racial weapons and spaceship command skills to unlock t2 stuff, 5.  
---
Your main weapons systems to 5 for t2. All weapon support skills not required to be at 5 for tech 2: 4. Like in gunnery you need motion production 5 for t2 close range and sharpshooter V for t2 ranged.    
---
The rest will depend on what you do, but if it doesn't need to be at 5 to unlock something, probably worth waiting a long time.
---
I am sorry - I do not know what that means. Could you enlighten me?
---
Oooo scary. Your Leadership does all the year long planning and linemembers like yourself come in and toot your little horns about slaying HK. Typical big bloc line member mindset. Riding on the coat tails. No different than the Middle Aged balding dad talking about how “ we” are going to the super bowl.
---
&gt; True balance means the constraint has to come from the ship's purpose not from time or resources. The bigger a ship gets, the less versatile it should be. Capitals and super capitals should be extremely specialized ships so bringing a fuckton of them to a fight doesn't mean an automatic win.
---
This. SO MUCH this. 
---
Gating the obtention (be it trough skills, time, character number or resources) just delays proliferation. You need to make it useless to have a ton of them. You need to make them vulnerable again, they should need support fleets to be fielded. They should need actual logistics to move.
---
Interesting. Is the source code open?
---
I read new eden worLd bank, and thought "what".
---
I have a warped viewpoint on this as we are NRDS. I can imagine I would have been a lot safer if I ran every time someone not blue came into system, but I didn't even run when it was a single red sometimes. I've picked off several solo hunters who gambled on me being AFK. But I also know I could do everything right (in fleet, good tank, aligned, alert, drones out and ready) and still die every day to hunters. My biggest safety was being an a system off the beaten path and not in a pocket.
---
By "somewhat balanced" it would have been even more balanced if their names didn't show in local till they uncloaked from the gate cloak, giving them a free two minutes to scan. If local comes back I hope they make that change. I'll just make sure I have more replacement mining barges on hand.
---
Dude, fuck off. I just built my shit you don't need another way to troll new bro's.
---
Yeah but market bots can't be caught and killed, so they're less fun to fight.
---
It's another subreddit for posting corps ads and such
---
Took me a while to realise how ridiculously cheap Keepstars are- sure you need to process it all but that is just time and several people running a few PI/injector farm accounts
---
What about if you're OCD over saving isk on ammo (even if it is negligible for most of us) or not over-killing the npcs; hence wasting time?
---
They said  that, foesnt make them stupid. 
---
Let's also not forget though that removal of local from null has been asked for, litterally, for years. If that change had happened in conjunction with say, the phoebe jump changes or, even before that. It would have been better.
---
I did it with my friend when they released command destroyers on the testserver. Not really practical for fleet fights though, the time window for the micro jump drive is actually quite small.
---
You can have some ammo, but just the projectile portion.
---
Yeah it's a good QoL change
---
Oh, sorry - I'm not used to using Reddit. I'll post there instead. Thanks for the heads up!
---
I'd rather kill myself (in game) than kill bots. After you dunk a few and learn the tricks it's pretty boring and unsatisfying.
---
Transfer to High Impact Sexual Violence
---
Too much isk and too little risk.
---
So is killing ventures in high sec, but there's an entire corp dedicated to that lmao
---
Absolutely.
---
I’ve noticed that some virgin in the internet won’t stop talking about cocks.
---
"highly dangerous" doesn't stop PVE. PVE has been nerfed constantly for recent 6 or 7 months, gankers who looking for ratting ships to shoot or try killing mining drones are no threat at all,highsec sucks and no one looking for "safe" in nullsec but killing null PVE content that's what they talking about. you are getting the wrong idea, yet again it's their playing style and no one care about yours.
---
I created a post in r/evejobs instead - How do I delete this one?
---
It's simple, CCP made an insane mistake when they made Eve a pay per win game with skill injectors.
---
When this happened everyone know that it was a stupid move that will destroy the game, its economy and will lead to an insane capital proliferation.
---
CCP ignored that because they're greedy and honestly thay care more of their monthly results that the health of their game (which is basically their only income source because every other project was a huge fail), and they pretend to fix this mess without touching injectors.
---
In this way they are destroying a huge amount of other game mechanics and thing people (their customers) built in years of planning and training.
---
That's the big picture.
---
I'm not the one thinking about his mom slurping on 
---
because... fuck eve and CCP
---
Just read the posts, you may find what you need in them.

true leet pvp would have been dropping large gunned dreads

It seems like you are.
---
Scanning all sigs, yeah. I’m really new. Only been in jspace for 5 years.
---
Nothing. I don't even have a super though. My point was purely against the "ratting in supers was a mistake".
---
With miner II they mine less than a Hulk. They should probably do less than a skiff or Mack.      
---
I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's the best we've got in years.
---
Depends on what you feel is better..n
---
I find that highly unlikely sadly - Thanks for the help all the same!
---
This is what some of us have been pushing for all along, but the only way it's going to happen is by expanding the playerbase and providing SUSTAINABLE content generators. You wouldn't have to roam for hours at a time before firing a shot if there were pvp hotspots that encouraged and rewarded people for fighting over them constanly.
---
Unfortunately, CCP seems to think that the key to success is to constantly tweak the game to maintain steady numbers of ratter/miner deaths by increasing per-capita deaths to compensate for a shrinking population. It's analogous to completely ignoring the need for renewable energy sources because "hey, we can just set up MORE drills to better harvest the diminishing supply of fossil fuels! This can only end well!".
---
PvPers need to be given the tools to reliably create their own content, instead of being dependent on krabs to do so. We have TONS of people who WANT to fight, but don't particularly want to get slaughtered in a one-sided stomp just because they happened to run into another gang with twice as many ships (or twice as expensive ships). Krabs normally provide the static, reliable content because THEY GET PAID TO DO SO - they may not be interested in pvp, but until recently, their krabbing paid out enough isk to compensate for their losses.
---
CCP has toyed with the idea of effectively paying people to pvp, in such incarnations as factional warfare and the old moon mining system, but never seemed to consider it much of a priority - what need is there for sustainable, pvper-driven content when we can just make krabs easier to kill, right? At this point, though, the flaws in that policy have become so obvious that even CCP might be able to see them.
---
GIVE US SPACE OBJECTIVES TO FIGHT OVER. If you're too lazy to program quality content of that nature, then just plop down some literal isk faucets that periodically squirt out a stream of isk that's split among everyone within range (except shuttles, ventures, pods, etc) - kind of like factional warfare plexes, except less complex (no pun intended). I mean, this particular example has obvious, glaring flaws and really shouldn't be implemented as-is, but FFS it's better than nothing, which is what we have now. CCP needs to give us SOMETHING along these lines and then ACTUALLY iterate on it - delivering reliable and sustainable content should be one of their top priorities at this point.
---
&gt;Your avoidance is some 7 year old weakness forum shit.  People like you always die young though so no big deal.
---
Not avoiding anything relevant, sorry to disappoint you.  Also the saying is the good always die young...so whats that say about you?
---
Indeed!
---
Salty vet syndrome. Mad cause they wont be able to drop titans on new bros.
---
Got to love a biter!
---
Ratting in supers is a mistake because they are strategic assets that pay for themselves. Strategic assets should be like F-35's, you use them to win wars, not make money.
---
I'd prefer that nullsec PvE be done in battleship fleets.
---
&gt; THAT would drive up wars. Because bashing structures will then be rewarding, rather that simply just boring. At least in null, that makes perfect sense. Why is the "no rules here" area as safe as fucking highsec?
---
I wish I could upvote you twice. Loot will always be the best driving factor for conflict. Since moons were reworked, CCP has relied too much on grudges and politics to drive conflict between null entities, but the blue donut and NIPs have circunvented that. Now, Imagine the piñata being held inside the main stations of the biggest blocks.

---
There used to be a concept, before CCP buffed cap and supercap damage application. It was called "support fleets". In ancient times, caps and supers would struggle to kill, say, a cruiser fleet. So you could not field them alone or in blobs of one ship, you needed to have other pilots in small stuff to clear off tackle, ewar and such.
---
OP input broadcast mines in procurers in the SG-CTQ constellation in delve if anyone wants to kill him
---
Right, but as I pointed out, “muh sandbox” isn’t an argument.

Cat ears and made up genders, increase penalties on death and make storing assets cost. All these ideas would be great if printed on toilet paper, to be used for their true value.

While I'm not against regular carrier ratting myself, I did love my shiny rattle, but there's not a chance in hell I'm undocking it right now. Even PvP fit I stand no chance against a blob of bombers, and I also enjoy looking at other areas of my screen apart from the d-scan window. 
---
CCP need to switch anoms up for it to be worth using. A carrier or two supported by battleships running gated mini- incursion type sites would be ideal imo. Enemies dealing Omni damage would be a bonus, so PvP fits would be more efficient. Then no easy kills for hunters, no definite saves for ratters.
---
Lol no one rage rolls away from pvp. You’ve never actually lived in a c5 and been in a c5 corp. The only times big c5 corps roll away absent an eviction threat is when there was no pvp content there or the pvp has finished and both sides are ready for a new chain. 99% of rolling is done in c5 space for the purpose of finding content. You’re only making it harder to find content by making our only reliable content-generator unreliable. Sure it’ll make that once-in-a-blue-moon time that we do roll away from pvp (probably because 3/4ths of the Corp are on an away eviction) harder. It’s a net decrease in pvp which is why it’s a bad change. I would love it if the Age of Chaos would bring more pvp but this change does the opposite.
---
Now my question is why do you think you’re entitled to comment on how this change will affect wormholes — having had 0 experience in them?
---
You're probably not the only one, but you'd all be wrong.
---
EVE is a hard game. People burn out. People quit. People can't commit the same amount of time they once did after they've got jobs, relationships, families that demand their time more than a game of grinding the same PVE sites or rocks for hours on end. 
---
That all means that players leave.
---
If you don't top them up from somewhere else, you are guaranteed failure.
---
The difference is this: While krabbing with local and no one else in system the threat level is minimum. When a hunter showed up in local, the threat level rose and the krabber, if not AFK, could begin to make decisions (good and bad) immediately, long before the hunter got in range. Even aligned a mining barge takes a day and a half to get into warp and if you're mining really close to a gate you may not have enough time. It was a cat and mouse game.
---
Now with local gone, the first warning a krab gets to the presence of any threat is when the threat is targeting him. Hunters can get into system undetected, scan for targets undetected, and warp to those targets undetected. The krab has almost zero chance of survival. There is no amount of skill or attention that will keep the krab from dying. His ONLY chance of survival is be in a blob so big the hunter decides to move on. 
---
Before, krabbing was a survivable way of making a living in Eve without being a member of a blue donut. Now, the ONLY way to survive in that business is to join the blobs. So much so that I could be easily convinced that Goons/PanFam/Test were behind the changes to drive up recruiting.
---
These two ideas are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

Toot toot

I mean like incursion sites, but higher paying to account for not having CONCORD.

Imagine using an overplayed trope like imagine.. because you are so original.

Yeah, I'd definitely support that.

The removal of wormholes has been asked for, for years as well. Does that make it a good idea?
---
You do realize it's not necessary to keep talking to me to allow you to enjoy those images in your mind of slurping on cock because automatically and uncontrollably, you'll find yourself thinking about that anyway, regardless.

Because I have no idea what that will trigger your thinking. What exactly it will be that you will encounter in your daily life that will cause you to instantly imagine

Brown coated cock

It might be going through a door will cause you to imagine it even more.

Or flipping a light switch off or on. Or maybe the feel of water on your skin will trigger the thoughts.

As you read these words, which of those do you imagine will most cause you to find yourself thinking of

Uncontrollably?

So in other words, you want to make sure that bombs never land. Gotcha.

i see what you did there

I have the sources saved on my imgur in which a dev did confirm that. Some of the links are even there in the pic I linked above but you didn’t bother to check them.

Just make structures have volume/item count limited safety hangar, everything else drops. Also increased salvage count when killed.

Oh yeah because im gonna type out the links... SURE

Maybe a tutorial that actually TEACHES then doesn't guide players directly into the soul crushing Missions system would be a start.

Farming obscure faction items like storyline items and the epic arc rewards, drug manufacturing, seeding lowsec markets

Another great job done by SC, thank you!
---
1)Younger people (generational, not raw age) have short attention spans
---
2)EVE is a high attention span game
---
3)CCP is expert at creating "bitter vets" some of whom leave.
---
4)re: Point 3 "Quitting is considered "Winning" EVE.
---
5)As I've pointed out elsewhere in ANY business it's harder and more expensive to get new customers than it is retaining present customers. The most profitable customers are ALWAYS long term customers.
---
6)Houston(CCP) you have a problem....
---
This right here shows how much of a clue you don't have about this. 
---
Hiring Red Frog to move blue loot? lmao
---
But it doesnt need to be that way. I've played pretty casually for almost 10 years. Like 5-10 hours a week and most if not all of that on the weekends. You can balance the game and rl but the game and it's people arent good at conveying that. I agree with op we should make things better for the people who do stay as their the ones keeping CCP's lights on. New player retention shouldnt be neglected but if you keep brakeing shit no one will wont to play most definitely not new players
---
You are Tigger!
---
Oh no, we're not begging you to look away. Please come and farm in wormholes. It's super safe and it's super profitable.
---
I honestly don't know why it's mostly empty space with untouched riches. I wonder why that is.
---
Besides that you can be creative and start a business. Saw one guy who advertised himself as the trash collector. He would buy all the small bits of stuff you have located in a dozen different stations, collect them and sell them in Jita for a profit. Totally worth it.
---
I wholeheartedly agree but tbh the whole "finishing what started 5 years ago thing.." It's like.. if we got that ish outa the way, there may be more spare time to think ahead about the important things we've been putting balancing on the burner for. More time, effectively, for bigger fish. Idk. I work better in sunlight than with dark clouds looming (metaphorically). lol.
---
Reminds me of epic games and paragon... :/
---
I step for improvement would also be making it easier for new players to form and join groups.  
---
I am sure the game would look a lot different if you could:
---
* accept members into a corp and give them roles without giving them the ability to steal everything, including your corp
---
* accept corps into an alliance without having to worry that they might flip the alliance  
---
I mean, yes there have been cheerished moments, when there was a successful heist, corpflip or alliance flip including sov takeover.  
---
But for every one of those, there are hundreds of cases where simple things like forming a group of players that might have common interests get shut down, just because it also might give them the ability to shatter your group.

Also the market has changed.  When eve first came out, it was one of the rare non WoW clones.  But the market has shifted.  There are more thing that eat into peoples time now a days, movies have gotten batter, there are more shows on tv that are interesting, mobile gaming has taken off in a big way, newer games to play both on console and pc.  Eve's average base when i started in 2004 was mid 20's early 30's.  Thous people are now in there 40's and 50's, meaning family life is going to eat up into there time.
---
The times have changed, eve has to adapt to the new way the world works and plays games, or it will die.  It can not keep catering exclusively to the old players, because we are a dying breed.  My son who is 8 would rather use his ipad in any room of the house then be stuck on a chair in front of a pc.  These are things eve has to over come.
---
Attract your old players back, keep the ones you have, but you must get new blood or you will die.
---
I really would not be suprized if eve echos becomes far more popualr then eve online ever was.  The times have changed.
---
UI/UX changes please, veteran players and new players benefit from this, make the UI intuitive, not have to read a manual/website to play a video game!
---
I'll outlive you. And it's the stupid and the good die young.  You're time is definitely short.

Put an alt in Signal Cartel and check her out. But in the meantime, here’s the info about her on our site: https://www.signalcartel.com/copilot
---
That is a question for the developer, A Dead Parrot.
---
That is a nice mix of being a condescending boomer and not understanding what is actually going on.
---
Also you are taking the "winning eve" meme way too seriously.
---
There’s*
---
You picked a great time to play :) just this subreddit is cancer, honestly - everything about this place screams toxic
---
No. Dont let them dock. I managed fine without docking for years.
---
And a good UI setup for new players as opposed to the trash default setup would be good
---
It actually boggles my mind that they haven't had some sort of contest to design a new standard overview/window configuration that applies to all new accounts.
---
well don't say 'a dev didn't say it' when the post literally says SOURCES in it. What did you think, he just made them up?
---
defender launcher, bubbles, not sitting at 0m/s, not sitting in one single spot, not beeing dumb fleet warping to unscouted gates...
---
easy things basically everyone with half a brain should be able to follow. and there are even more. so stop crying and dont be shit.
---
Just dont dock it, ever and you are fine. We managed that way for years
---
So a new player can't open up the eve uni wiki, inform themselves for 20mins and then form a corp? It is the same shit eve vets have to do.  
---
I agree the role system needs an overhaul to be more easily understandable/should be streamlined somewhat but patching out risks associated with giving out roles/having to put trust into other players would just make the game more flat.
---
I mean, does it hurt to be this angry at other people for not playing the game the same exact way you do?
---
Can I have your stuff if you aren't playing anymore?
---
&gt;Maybe consider the poor retention rate is due to the fact that your game isn’t for everyone
---
You want to tell me EVE isn't all about epic nullsec battles?
---
well.. yes, gokus are strong. but are they op in a way that they need to get nerfed? i dont think so.
---
they are just extremely good because they are the only doctrine able to stay on grid with a fuckoad of supers. everything else gets anihilated immedieately.
---
Pretty sure you're wrong ;)
---
Skill points are the problem, and the single largest barrier to entry to the game.  They need to cut out the middleman and sell pilots with 50 or 100 million unallocated skill points.
---
TLDR: things are changing drastically and rapidly. People are upset. The sky appears to be falling as a result. 
---
Everything will be fine meme.
---
"What is actually going on..." Is that so? Well! DO feel free to enlighten me as to...

&gt;Cooling happens only when no active modules in the rack are heated:
---
nope, I tested by burning one 50MN to 93% and then I used solely  the compact sebo and I was stuck at 93% for 2 OL cycles (20s). 
---
Also since e\^-Heatdissipation rate is the multiplication per second : for the mid , e\^(−0.009999999776482582) = 0,990049834 which is definitely not 1-1.014/100 = 0.98986
---
Granted it's less of a problem when you can sub but when your choice is "train skills that are universally useful, and also needed for the (mandatory for PvP) T2 tank modules" or "train skills that let you use more ships and play more of the game" it definitely feels like there's a roadblock with the only choice being "what do I cut myself out of?"
---
Eve shouldn't be easy but if you want to get new people to stay, reducing the months' worth of training time before they can have fun is a good start.
---
More or less... but not "new bros"

 Do you have statistics that show that most players like the changes in the game?
---
That sounds closer. I might’ve been thinking heated for the 1600 # on my fit, too.
---
EvE is so deep and so wide that no matter what changes in the game, there is a vocal minority ready to spew frustration because their comfortable playstyle has been changed. It's always a good time to get into EvE. The game is very helpful and the negativity is mostly veteran rich players who became comfortable in their grinds.
---
Not quite but getting there.
---
How do you work that out.   I can murder a low power structure with a couple of Talos's.
---
MMOs are struggling, being subscription based makes it even worse. This is evidenced by the nostalgia cashgrab that blizzard is currently pulling with classic.  
---
This is because current generations lack the attention span, but that the video game market as a whole has become a lot more saturated.  
---
If you want to play a social game with friends these days would you choose the grind of eve? Or more easily accessible/short term fun such as battle royale games?  
---
You will get roughly the same adrenaline rush from being in the later stages of a BR game as in an eve fight. But the latter requires you to do a whole lot of other shit beforehand.
---
 Now this is not completely comparable because a lot of the enjoyment in eve comes from slowly building yourself up.  
---
But it is so much harder to justify playing eve with all the available alternatives.  
---
If you wish you can add a "millenials are struggling with their work life balance because our society hasn't arrived in the 21st century wrt to working conditions" argument here if you like but i honestly don't care to get into that topic right now.
---
Your ignorance is astounding.
---
Bombing is *hard*. It's super easy to get the whole fleet killed by warping to the wrong ping, warping at the wrong time and getting caught in a bubble, or decloaking everyone and giving away your pings. All you are seeing is the last 5 seconds of a complicated maneuver that worked out right.
---
If it was easy then everyone would have their own bombing wing in every fight. The pay off is insane when you do it well. But they don't -- for a reason. All told I'm only aware of maybe half a dozen FCs in the entire game who can competently run a bombing fleet.
---
Oh noes, whatever will I do!
---
Sure, then make a "looking for frigate abyssal group" UI and direct players into it.
---
I was more talking about PvE than PvP. But my point is that there is no easy in-game UI for players to use for this, for those not in a corp.
---
Thank you for your cooperation and information. it was quite helpful but not anything i didn't already know.
---
You are not. I think this way. There are very inherent and unchangeable reasons why retention was always low. And the retention getting lower might be about late game stagnation than people might think. I will relay my views in the summit.
---
I followed up with ADP and here’s what he said: “It's 100% client based javascript, so they can open their browser tools and see the code for themselves. Chrome does not allow obfuscated code in extensions.”

---
&gt;When eve first came out, it was one of the rare non WoW clones  
---
I mean, being a WoW clone would have been literally impossible for EVE even if it had been exactly the same as WoW.
---
Eve is all about corps though
---
When his overlords permit it
---
Damn well done o7
---
MMOs are struggling because devs are competing to see how little they can put into the damn games and still turn a profit from whales.  A ton of gamers are just chomping at the bit for a well supported, fresh MMO.  Too bad gaming companies are too focused on a games-as-a-service model instead of making them, you know, GOOD.
---
SP really isn't pay to win, unless you consider injectors, the Character Bazaar, and waiting to be P2W.
---
Fix the overview and brackets.  Default overview is bad.  First thing I give new players used to be an overview setting that isn’t shit.
---
Your original post has determined that that is a lie.
---
Really?  Try high sec is what you bring to the table?  I'm silly for pointing out there are fucktons of abandoned systems, and you guys like "try high sec".  Ok.
---
You can have some ammo, but only the projectile portions.
---
For the "July Mining as a percentage of April Mining" graph, it would be clearer to show &lt;100% columns in a different color to indicate the downward trend.  
---
It can be done either manually, or usually with a color gradient option.  DiB vets will know more.
---
This would help a lot honestly. First few months of eve I had no idea you could edited your overview and fixing it improve my quality of life

---
When I started a few years ago I thought neat to get to fly some fun ships then I found out oh it's just world of tanks going to take years to get to anything worth flying.
---
Meanwhile, people are dropping Battleships on my venture and telling me to leave the game if I can't fly something better.
---
So them I buy some better gear for my ships so I can fight back only to find out I don't have the skills to use them.
---
and on and no it goes...
---
And everyone wonders why no one stays to play as bait for them after 30 days.
---
Should make c6 sites like c5 so they don’t have fixed spawns for battleship waves
---
I am, i’m just trying other methods instead of waiting another week x.x
---
takes clip from other eve youtube video and then posts it? Why, weve all seen titans cynoing link the dudes channel instead.
---
So people inject holders. Back in the day I used to train holders and sell them on the forums, now you can just inject them. There is literally no difference when supercapitals couldn't dock anymore as there are easy and fast ways to bypass this artificial limit.
---
CCP is not ignoring them, and that's the biggest problem.
---
I shall point you Dual Universe which is currently in Alpha. Has a few old eve devs, Plays like a cross of EvE, Minecraft and Elite: Dangerous.
---
Dev Q&amp;A's are fantastic and have a clear roadmap and communication to the players currently and I see no reason for that to change for them at the moment or long term.
---
Yup!
---
Injectors are already pay to win...
---
Buy Plex then buy injectors, I'm just saying cut out the middle man and sell characters with SP built in.
---
Grammar*
---
I would have done conditional formatting, but the free version of Power BI doesn't have it enabled.
---
Injectors are bought with ingame currency.
---
Injectors are not adding SP to the game (they actually remove it).
---
If you want a level 60 druid, go play WoW.
---
Some people come into Eve knowing the beautiful stuff waiting in the mid game and late game. The espionage, chance ravinne style wh diving, this is eve, big titan fights, betrayals and etc. They watch a video here, read a news item there and so on.
---
We didn't have much of those stories lately. And retention dropped what, 2 percent (I don't remember the exact percent in ghosts presentation). That's 2 out of every 100 players. That might as well be explained by the lack of factors for new players to suffer through the necessarily bad early game. Perhaps those 2 people were inspired by those late game stories, and were pushing through the early game because of that. Thus perhaps CCP should focus equally on mechanics that will start yielding those stories again.
---
Was it ever really "fun?" Really? It's just something to do.
---
yea thats titans cynoing in on something alright
---
Wow classic that way &gt;&gt;&gt; you won't be missed.
---
Eve is totally fine....
---
The best part is, it doesn't ACTUALLY take dev time to design changes; they have a huge number of people here who are much smarter than them and who have proven time and again that they're more than happy to help with that particular burden.
---
I mean, yes, people disagree on many things and it's not so simple as "do what the community wants", but PLENTY of the suggestions and feedback offered here come with in-depth explanations that someone with even a modicum of intelligence can use to help gauge the merit of the posts in question.
---
Apparently, though, it's far easier and more attractive to only read the posts that say what you want to hear, and take that as confirmation that you can continue doing whatever the F you please because "the playerbase supports our policies and decisions!". Who'd have guessed, right?
---
Yay, more submarine warfare!
---
Honestly, had something similar in mind, makes a lot of sense, which is why we'll get something to induce CTS instead.
---
CCP has actually made a ton of very bad gameplay design decisions over the past few years, add to that a whole bunch of broken promisses. 
---
Keep in mind this game isnt free (for the full featured game). 
---
We have every right to complain and be dissatisfied.
---
&gt; That might as well be explained by the lack of factors for new players to suffer through the necessarily bad early game. 
---
Or this is the actual issue. Sure, I fully agree some people come into this game starry-eyed about the crazy stories, but new players shouldn't feel like they need to grind early game to get to this point. All progression should feel worthwhile.
---
All the complaints from new players come from UI, lack of proper tutorials, and unrewarding early game mechanics. No one quits within a week because there's not enough stuff happening in space they probably won't see for quite a while.
---
Same reason MOST of null is empty my man :)
---
I was going to correct him about using "And" to start a sentence, but apparently that's completely fine.(Damn you public school teachers telling me otherwise!)
---
Still waiting for a full AAR for this fight, seems like it would be an interesting read.
---
Yeaaaa that's a stretch, will admit that; hell anything under 30 in my mind is pretty "small'ish."
---
If only "game with potential starting off on the right track" didn't end in disappointment so frequently.
---
Have you considered that maybe those "players" left for reasons that haven't been addressed and would come back if they were?
---
This would be hilarious if you weren’t in such a fragile emotional state. And frankly, it’s kind of like I’m at a zoo - entertaining in the same way.
---
So if I send you 1000 words, can you double them?
---
Tradition, primarily...
---
Yeah honestly we all had fun. And I didn't intentionally make it look that way? The footage of that fight was raw and all our dreads die within the video, I even included a battle report in the description. I like sharing all my footage of fights no matter the outcome.
---
You are right that ideally the progression should be worthwhile. But Eve is mechanically too archaic to achieve that and no npe iteration will change that. It's the reason why retention has traditionally been low.
---
Characters are bought and sold with in game currency
---
Injectors primarily remove SP from skill farm characters whose only purpose is to farm SP. 
---
Yes compare the most popular MMO to the least popular MMO.  I wonder why they are so popular?  They took the Everquest formula and made it more casual.  The game exploded in popularity when it was made more casual.
---
i mean, you're in TEST so you're used to thousand man fleets. I can see why you'd think that, but a 30 man fleet is not normally referred to as "small gang"
---
Removing SP specifically generated for the purposes of selling it kind of kills that point, don't you think? it's not like two players are making a trade of power for currency.
---
Because mega blocks hold huge swathes of space they barely use, disalowing any small group from taking it? 
---
Doesn't sound right.
---
i don't get what you're trying to reply to here. Rorqs can tank an almost infinite amount when panic is active, that's all i said
---
I just pictured a space person [saying this](https://youtu.be/xMntkZCGKzc)
---
I'll take it
---
No, it literally removes skill points, you don't get all of the points back when you inject them.  There is a net loss of skill points.
---
The monkey thinks I'm a monkey? Hilarious!!!
---
So what was the trigger?
---
Door? Light? Water? Something else?
---
For nullsec DEDs you want a blinged out T3 Cruiser like a Tengu, Loki or Proteus. 
---
A Stratios can handle 6/10s but only barely and takes forevers (which increases risk).
---
Because we aren't talking about low power structures.
---
You wouldn't bounty one... you'd just remove it with a few afk vexors.
---
Feel good video of the day
---
I was wondering where those anomalous gold awards were coming from - way to "put your money where your mouth is".
---
It would be funny if the majority of people who quit over CCP's recent, ill-conceived changes did this - I wonder how long it would take CCP to notice that the amount of money they were losing from cancelled subs roughly equaled the amount of money spent on giving Reddit gold awards to posts criticizing their "Era of Chaos".
---
Make an alt Corp and transfer it to that while you get rid of it so you can rejoin your people?
---
after basically wasting 6 years their job is to quickly make it look like they not only care, but are competent again
---
it'll take years of proper acting to fix the damage they've caused to the community
---
darn kids
---
Don't gat flair baited.
---
I know, im just saying at the time it was a rareity
---
THE Herculetz!
---
I feel this.  I'm trying to look at the comparison to more popular games (read: fun) and figure out the real differences in PvP.  I think it boils down to having an even playing field.  People in eve never attack you unless they're 90%+ sure they will win,they bring allies, and better ships to just shit on you.  And understanding your odds against a different ship takes months if not years of constant work to realize whereas in other games, it's clear with color-codes and/or numbers immediately.  Character level drives much of the character's strength.
---
It's unique that eve doesn't operate this way, and the fact that you can be in a role that people aren't immediately aware of is nifty.  It just makes it really hard for any new player to look at a fight and realize if they'll win or not.  So even people who embrace risk and gamble with their ships get shit on again and again until you learn that you should avoid fights.  Then they go back to high-sec (town with guards) because they  can't figure out how to succeed in a fight.  They go back to mission running because they clearly need money for ships and maybe PvE will teach them how to fight.  Then they leave.
---
A ton of other environmental and identity problems exist.  The biggest maybe being there is no goal; you have to decide what you want to do.  I would think eve devs should look at when end-game players tend to leave WoW or other theme-park styled MMOs.  Because in eve, you kind of start at the end.  There are no real "quests" or a leveling scheme that demands you go get xp.
---
How did they scam you
---
Why are people downvoting him? He’s right!
---
An epic arc special noob that will give you ship pre fitted for pvp - pve and at the end the magic 14.
---
EVE's in-game infrastructural design is perfect for new player retention - they just need to make it better. 
---
* **Highsec** = new player friendly, easy
---
* **Low Sec** = medium experience, medium difficulty
---
* **Null Sec** = experienced player, hard difficulty
---
* **Wormhole Space** = people who think they are experienced, easier than Low Sec but don't tell anyone
---
If they just adjust the in-game content in each sector vs. nuking everyone's god damn playstyle to fit a family portrait with a single child who's a spoiled brat and has mental breakdowns in the grocery store because you refused to get them a starburst pack at the cash register.
---
Can’t transfer remotely
---
Short version - came back from a real life deployment, wanted desperately to join any 0.0 corp, test was first one i spoke to, they said i was kinda suspicious because i was apply to two seperate corps at once, told me contract shit to get it out to Fountain and id be fine. Then said fuck you took may Navy Apoc and Corpse collection. Left me with 40-50m isk total. So now I would kill test over anyone else in eve given the option till the debt is paid.
---
Mostly your general attitude toward life and human interaction.
---
Noob doesnt care about stagnation.... because... they are noob...
---
Only when we need to hear ASP cry big baby tears.
---
Big ol RIP. If I run into it I'll let ya know
---
Oh damn!
---
If they had a failsafe method of differentiating genuinely new players from alt accounts and were willing to impose a hard limit of one such character sold to each new player, then that might not be an entirely terrible idea.
---
Given that CCP does NOT posses such means...can you imagine the negative effects this would have on the game?
---
yeah this is 100% preferable, but in the absence of such changes, a "titans are the only ship that matters" meta could be improved by making titans more accessible &amp; giving everyone a chance to do something important in piloting them.
---
Are you FDIC insured?
---
This. The default overview is junk. I'm still ironing out quirks of the Z-S overview. And the window layout is utter garbage. Once I saw a JonnyPew video I started to set my window layout like his (then he went and quit Eve, twice.) For such a great game, the UI fails, hard. CCP needs to hire a UI/UX consultant/expert and fix that.
---
They, and Frat have lots of botters.
---
You worry about that plank in your eye, first, Mr. we **dawned** our GPD Police skins.
---
Edifying as usual
---
Noobs care about stories. Stagnation stagnates stories.
---
Isn't focusing on "well-rounded balance across the game" a big part of why people are complaining now?  There's a lot of salt from vets mad CCP is talking about nerfing their favorite toy.
---
I mean, better balance would probably improve new player retention, since new players can't fly the unbalanced ships anyway, but I don't think "people who will sub for years on end" are all taking news of changes well.
---
The most vocal groups are usually the ones who are mad about the state of the game. The ones who are enjoying the state of the game are to busy playing it to say anything.
---
That was my thought. He might just be getting extra space out of his trip.

Which one? That my general attitude toward life and human interaction causes you to find yourself thinking about your mom slurping

Brown coated cock?

OR perhaps as you keep becoming more aware you're thinking about both, more and more, clearly you'll start to understand just how impossible it is to stop. 
---
And the really interesting thing about all this is, the more you try in vain to stop yourself from preventing the fact you're becoming aware that it's all  actually happening more, the more you'll obviously realize you have. Have you not?
---
The fact WHS doesn't have enough people to burn every structure in null and couldn't be bothered to do it even if they did, along with the fact you have assest safety escaped you completely in your assessment then? You make it sound like it's impossible to live under blackout, which it clearly isn't, where as with unlimited mass WHS the only people that could live there would be the largest coalition in the game...not exactly hard to see the bias here...
---
The NIP doesn't cover hunting or whaling and never has. Not sure why you thought it did.

Definitely too difficult then?

If you're willing to give me money, sure.

  Believe it or not- Everyone does PVE on the side to fund PVP. I do this. I'm not asking for super safe AFK ming numbing sites.

 Allow me to earn a good income, with a ship that requires active pilotting (fuck rorq mining)
---
Get out of the .01 game, you'll feel better anyway. Specmanip/rares/off-market trading is still doing fine.
---
did you take that from a facebook page?
---
Definitely wormholer salty.
---
Well to transfer it you need to get in there. 
---
If you can do that then your other option (if you have a suitable alt) is to have that alt create a tiny corp, transfer the structure to the corp, close the corp. I've no idea who ends up owning structures if a corp closes now that I think about it! But if it doesn't let you do that it's still in a corp you don't care about.
---
Procedurally generated missions?
---
Yep, i’ve been trying to find it for weeks.
---
Oh? Then perhaps you can enlighten me as to why you never run out of sites and they don't all end up stacked in a dead system in the ass end of the universe?
---
The point is they are removed from characters that don't contribute to the game in any way.  Skill farms aren't out in ships...they sit in stations and extract SP every month.
---
People are already doing this though, they are buying plex and either injecting capital pilots, roq pilots, or buying pilots.
---
Hey Dreddit bro! Welcome back! You know you can hop in our discord https://discord.gg/eeCX7ch and we could get you back in and helped out in no time. Since you were already in once, the app process would be short and sweet for you. Looking forward to seeing you around 07

Jesus, what do you want to fly? Dessies are totally worth flying and they don't take years.

Join init renters or whoever lives there, move your shit to high sec. Decide where you want to go/join and move there. You can also use remote jump clone once a year so you can jump clone to your corp station.

You can also sell most of your styff locally too, just put it 80% jita buy and someone will eventually buy. https://evepraisal.com/

&gt; condescending boomer 
---
You think a lot of boomers play EVE? Really?
---
I no longer recall the source, but I distinctly recall this being discussed a couple of years ago, and someone from CCP weighing in explaining that it was a mess basically, and that they had no idea what would happen to seemingly unrelated systems if they messed with it.
---
Hi there, here is an episode of my solo PvP adventure in EVE Online. I'm making this serie to improve my solo PvP capabilities, so any tips, advice, fits or ISK are welcome.
---
I was comparing size for size, so small POS vs. Astra.
---
For industry it's not comparable at all. Citadels are better by a huge margin.
---
From what I've heard, ffxiv is doing better than ever.  
---
And it's subscription.
---
I think you are partially correct. I find it hard to believe that the game-as-service system is bad for long running MMOs though. I mean that is exactly what a sub-based game is.
---
And (to nitpick) we have the standby naintenance mode because that is what is economically feasible, not because the devs want it to be that way.  
---
If it was more profitable to release new, more fleshed out MMO than keeping the old ones running we would have them on the market right now. It is just how the entire industry is ran at the moment ( not saying that it is great).
---
If you basically need the same amount of ships to do it kind of defeats the purpose and need to do smart bombing.  The only reason this was so popular was because it was a smaller group engaging a larger group and using mechs to their advantage.  Maybe look at how smart bombing was instituted and why, could possibly change you perspective of efficiency instead of just gobbing onto an efficiency calculator that does not take into account tactics.
---
I would like to know more.
---
\*Ducks\*
---
"eve bank"
---
Yeah and how much did you sell holders for?id bet it’d be way way more expensive to inject one than to have bought one pre-citadel
---
How do I move my shit to hi-sec? I have to contract it out if I remember correctly?
---
shut the fuck up, retard
---
But "progression" is not worthwhile. I'm a few months in and I do not know where to go, what I can do, because looking at a mid to late game there is no stability. Is my training time going to be wasted on a whim/nerf? What are my choices of gameplay that will not be "chaos"'d away? 
---
My only real option right now is to win eve, watch the subreddit and return to the game if/when CCP has decided WTF this game is supposed to be.
---
Did it break when you dropped it?
---
What are you getting at?
---
it was worth it for the "stop resisting" local spam at the end :P
---
This game shines at its finest when it's all about a group of nerds having fun &lt;3 You guys seemed to be doing exactly that, so there you go I guess :) 
---
Keep at it &lt;3
---
This Noob cares about stability. I want to be able to choose a playstyle and a skill progression that will not be eliminated. Hillmar's capricious attitude does not lend it's self to confidence.
---
I think you are the only one, sure EVE isn't a game for everyone but there is so many activities avaliable that many player can find what he likes.
---
The problem is that CCP don't show enough to newbro what they can do.
---
Second big problem is that many of the funny content is only avaliable to veteran player.
---
So does the empty holes held by the large wormhole evictors
---
r/hentaimemes obviously
---
&gt; Edifying 
---
Good word!
---
I read it as “New Eden World Bank” and thought it was going to be some scam investment program lol
---
May want to ask yourself the same question there hoss.
---
My skill farm is. That is because it is a pilot that is "done" with the training I need for them. Any overage I goo to another character that is training.
---
So what are you talking about?   One line answers are never enough when you are talking about something as complicated as structures.
---
  It has some (limited) uses:
---
  1. Set destination, Warp to bookmark in space on gate at zero, while in warp, turn on autopilot. Guaranteed never to need a slowboat to the gate like you sometimes do if you just say “jump” on the gate
---
  2. Light a cyno next to a station. Rught click the station say “set destination”, turn on autopilot. You will dock as soon as your cyno cycles
---
  3. (As someone else said) set destination on a station, warp to your instadick bookmark at zero. While in warp turn on autopilot. You will dock immediately when you land
---

---
I asked. The answer was: no.
---
Null sec is "hard."  That's a good one.  This guy's got jokes!
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Initiative_Associates
---
Try contacting them in game, under peoples e places type initiative ( check the necom on your top left corner of your screen). 
---
Or again sell it locally, its easier to just make a contract. Also in the neocom menu
---
i don't think you understand 
---
The reason I unsubbed my accounts has nothing to do with safety or whatever other shit the "eLiTe pVpErS" throwing shit at people on reddit/eve-o will inevitably reply to this comment with.
---
My reason is simple: I very deliberately chose NOT to live in a wormhole, because I have no interest in that play style. I've spend almost 2 years making a home in null, and now CCP has apparently decided null players should live like wormholers.
---
So my choices are: accept it and play like a wormholer, which I have zero interest in. Move to another area and throw away the last 2 years of my play time to start fresh, which I'm not about to do. Go play PUBG, or whatever the new version of that is these days.
---
Since CCP apparently feels we should be all about instant gratification anyway and doesn't give two shits about those of us stupid enough to have been doing long-term empire building shit, I guess the best option is to go play PUBG.
---
I can’t help with .01 ISK battles, but to make finding market making opportunities, I wrote some tools and added it to my discord bot. Specifically,  the `!mpvp` command (market pvp, get it?) looks at the market gap between buy and sells for everything on a market, figures out what’s “interesting”, accounting for fees and volume, and shows you only those things.
---
If you’re interested in using it, feel free to check it out! I posted about it yesterday https://reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cuh5sp/introducing_matcalc_a_discord_bot_for_industry/
---
You da best mang, appreciate it!
---
Yes, but the implication is that the characters in question would allow you to buy that SP more cost efficiently than through making a new character and injecting it.
---
If that WASN'T the case, what would be the point of the suggested feature? Why would it even be suggested in the first place?
---
So you have no idea what a noob think when he starts eve.
---
So you dont agree with Olmeca and more with me. It s okay.
---
I am not talking about founding a corp, the EVE UI (surprisingly) does a good job telling you what skills and isk you need.  
---
There is no risk to patch out. The reality is that players are just not given roles, corps are forced to merge or that people throw useless 1 man alpha corps in to keep most votes for executor corp, no matter what happens.
---
nigga worry about your money and worry about your muscle dont worry about no other mans
---
Patience testing wank like these kinds of threads need to fuck if off and die forever
---
The statistics are with CCP. They make these changes to make the books work, not to please the players. You can't make everyone happy if you don't exist, so it is far better to exist and have some unhappy people than to cease business.
---
How good will the game be for those complaining, if it isn't there one day?
---
It is what it is. It won't be perfect, but at least it will be.
---
At the time WoW was a rarity too for how casual it was tbh

Please place extension on Firefox?

Yeh totally fair!

on the next bar we are hitting. ccp will be drinking most voted shots in stream
---
Yeh drifter is super easy to multibox with. How fast did you finish the actual sites?
---
Yeh its a Good starting point, and it's really good isk over the course of a week. If You beared 2-3 hours a night for a whole week, you would have no problem hitting 20-25b. I grinded enough isk for a titan and character in less than a month (although I was autistically running sites constantly)

Add me on discord. Lets chat
---
They need to give players a preview in a few different sandboxes isolated from the rest.
---
Login for the first time, and get a choice of several different end-game activities. Have players join a mining Op, PVP Op, a WH group... all filled out with AI and made to mimic how these things are later in the game. Give them a taste of that, then let them choose the one they liked the most. Proceed to give them skills that go toward that career path and have a fighting chance of staying engaged while knowing what they can be doing later.
---
Googling those things and turning up a video of a bunch of purple and red boxes in a zoomed-out view with no context isn't a way to get new players hyped for things.
---
They need to try them somehow.
---
Its a pretty huge difference. Main things are application, as well as scalability. Drone travel time plays a role in dps, so it will always be a factor, so it saves a lot of time Keep drones balled up within 20km of the spawn point, and use missiles for far off targets. Ive done the whole RR drone comps, and this is significantly faster. Like 2-3× the amount of isk/hour
---
Yeh exactly, the lack of avengers helps a lot, and you have perfect application against every ship class
---
Each abyssal BCS cost less than 50m
---
Yeah it comes down to finding a fun bunch of dudes to enjoy the game with for me. So I don't play as much. I don't want it to feel like a job to log in
---
Small gang PVP - small gangs feel more like a team and you can see the impact your contribution has to every member of the team. I'd find a small gang pvp corp and join it and hang out on voice with them
---
Like many people who play this game would say, eve is not just a pvp game. 
---
Have you tried other things this game has to offer? If you need a tight-knit community go find yourself an active &gt;200 man WH corp. 
---
Some null sec corps also do a good job integrating people - eventually it is not because the game you play that you login, it becomes logging in to chat with friends and eve is just a vehicle for fun.
---
It fucked up my headphones Bluetooth connection
---
Nope, something your mother told me post-coitus.

Depending on the race it was 8 to 10 bil ISK iirc.

RIP this Rorq, It mined lots of ore efficiently

They'd rather drive away part of their existing customer base in an effort to increase it that hasn't worked yet, and probably never will.

How he subbed his account wouldn't matter if you're getting at what I think you're getting at. PLEX is never free. Somebody paid CCP for it.

Here is where real-world and ISK is discussed for 3rd-party apps. [https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources)

Do you have and can share the fit? I was theorycrafting for a long time a same fit and it's been rather succesful. Just curios. Didn't know the terminology. What does fof stand for?
---
SkullU indeed, my bad.
---
There's another argument that can be added to this: the Alpha SP Limit. Alpha Accounts can only train 5mil SP, and after that you just can't train skills anymore. You start by burning the Magic 14, suddenly you can't even consider trying to fly new ships without being forced to Omega.
---
Nice.  Got a PDF or something to download this target?

This thread was about making wormholes less safe. The context of making some space 'less safe' is always making it less safe for PVE guys. And just because i don't spend a lot of time hunting ratters doesn't mean that i don't know how to hunt them.
---
My original comment would currently be in the negative points if i suggested anything that would make PVPers less safe. You aren't allowed to do that apparently.
---
What he is saying is all caps tank based on recharge rate and EHPs, meaning you need to put certain number of ships against specific caps to break tank.
---
But with Panic, it doesn't matter, you can have 50 Titans or 50 slashers and rorq is still gonna tank for 7 minutes due to PANIC.
---
I think it's a very valid point.
---
Remove Panic, buff EHP of Rorq, make it bit more than Super. Or make PANIC add xxx amount of EHP based on the skill level.
---
How does a Rorq mine Mercoxit?
---
On the note of career agents, add an overview career agent that walks a newbro through the basics on how to change overview settings, colors, brackets, and how to import/export overviews. That way it matters less that the default overview is terrible (although that does still matter).
---
Also just for shits and giggles, throwing in the accuracy score vs evasion score reddit thread from a few years ago. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4gsgq3/psa_turret_tracking_is_no_longer_in_terms_of/d2kxvx7/?context=3).
---
Try wormholes, if you want small tight knit community, and people to teach you pvp.
---
On what schedule are investment reports disbursed?
---
You simply aren't understanding the intricacies of this community, which is understandable because it is a WEIRD community. We all bitch and moan about everything making it seem like we hate the game but we love this game more than most communities love theirs. Some other things you may notice:  
---
* We will shit talk to no end while blapping the ever living fuck out of you but likely reimburse your ship, send you a bunch of resources on how to get better at the game afterwords
---
* We will mine salt, so the more agitated you act the more likely people are to continue to troll you, so act aloof and you'll be fine
---
* Scamming is 110% ok in this game, so be on the look out
---
* While we are a bunch of nerds with anger issues, I have never seen another community come together like this one for tragedies. A prime example is the stop of hostilities after Libya when a member of Goonswarm was killed, many cynos where lit in memory of our fallen member. 
---
EVE online is a community unlike any other. We are one big dysfunctional family, sure we bitch and moan, and hate on each other but deep down we are all friends in our own totally fucked up ways.
---
And I'm saying there is absolutely nothing that should make me assume you're there for anything else but killing me. You absolute cretin. That's why you and Empty You are total hypocrites for assuming a pocket retreated from in the wake of your uninvited arrival means consent to kill the MTU. All you do is piss off honest pilots, and your "service" is of no use to New Eden whatsoever.
---
Edit: And furthermore, I posit that the lot of you lack the stones to keep on shooting MTUs if doing so were to give you suspect or wanted status.
---
I personally use Caldari drones most because if they get shot at their main tank (shields) will regenerate on its own without me having to dock up or RR them.

---
Newbro here, my friend introduced me to ninja-huffing in w-space, it got me thinking about trying to produce polymers for T3 ship manufacturers, but I'd need a refinery. From what I can tell from my research, it would be improbable/impossible to do solo. I'd like to know if it is feasibly possible to solo operate a moon mining refinery to a capacity to produce polymers, and what skills and ships should I consider investing in to make that happen?
---
They are also brittle and super vulnerable to larger ships in smaller groups.
---
I'm the same - EVE is a great game but I'm just irredeemably bad at it. While I enjoy my time, I always find the feeling that I'm shit a bit unsettling so I stop.
---
Like that time I started a job, realised I was crap at it so handed in my notice rather than drag my area down, if you see what I mean.
---
Wouldn't say that. Almost everyone who sends ships into combat has it trained. It's more like showing up to play baseball with your bat and glove.
---
tbh your tripleposting is pretty well grouped
---
All you have to do is look at info pane. It tells you what services are available. Do you people actually play EVE?
---
Thanks I'm a professional
---
I mean he pretty much dumped every bit of info in that one line lol
---
i liked the idea but i don't really enjoy anything timed. Speed mining seems foolish
---
Nullsec being way more safe than Hisec has long overthrew the whole risk vs reward principles of this game, which has caused fundamental issues. Delve being the very exponent of it. Carebear space should be in hisec, not in nullsec inflating the game's economy.
---
Technically,  They DO spawn.   One of the guy's in Sinner's (Scotty) found something...interesting...when a drifter went to a wormhole that was not on sig list while they were trying to kill it.    It never populated unless you warp straight to the hole instead of the drifter.
---
Why do you think he wants to shoot it? Cuz it's such a pain to break out the exhumers for it.
---
Very nice
---
Hey you're wrong again! Who knew?  This kind of rhetoric still just makes you an awful person.
---
Then its only available to certain groups and isn't stackable. Plus, you essentially could just contract it to your corporation which puts a false increase of value on the enemy's structure
---
Caught us a Hel and fought through some fax repp. Then wiped out several subcap waves while trying to keep it tackled and the jammer alive. Jammer died and a new fax appeared but we managed to kill both in the end. Big Drama show :D
---
gf to those guys thatfought hard almost succeeded
---
Was fun watching it on stream... That ending could have escalated though - lucky for us, that nothing huge happened :D
---
That was so close
---
What does flying logi mean exactly and why is it memed?
---
So the title scammed you?
---
CCP being 5+ years late before wising up, what's new I guess.
---
Mt
---
As has been said, find a small gang environment.  There are ships you can fly in those gangs that are varying levels of difficulty and importance so you can pick something that suites your ability and/or allows you to develop your skills.
---
And doesn’t know about unidentified drifter wormholes on kspace side when it’s literally one of the hyper increases changed in the past month as well thonking
---
You do understand what boomer means, right?
---
That I'm not sure that guy understands what boomer means and is just regurgitating buzz words because he's not half as clever as he thinks.
---
Boomers are the baby boomers. I doubt they play a lot of eve overall.
---
LISTEN HERE OLD SPORT, I was under the indication the clock was still moving and like 5 hours off, how was I wrong
---
I'm pretty sure most would welcome the change actually. Sure there are some krabs but in general it's not nearly as krabby as null.
---
You might be able to break those negative emotions by losing 50-100 t1 frigates fw PvP. This kind of flying can help you embrace the idea that hulls and fits are just a different kind of ammunition... and when was the last time you were upset when you had to reload your guns?
---
holy fuck you are a nogo at this station, please go see Sgt BeenIntooLong for retraining, priiii
---
That reminds me, can you have her top up the prepaid cellphone she gave me?  All her late night calls burned up all my minutes.
---
Ironically, I've been doing more pvp in HS than I ever did in null or WH space.
---
I had the same thing happen to me.
---
A copy of this would be fun to have for the range... can I get one to put a 50 bmg round through each of those?
---
Oh come on, it's no more than 6 months to fly specialized minmaxed t2 fitted t2 hulls, and in less than 1 month you can have competitive skills in any t1 subcap hull. Capitals are less than a year to MASTER, not just sit in the ship. Quit whining about non-issues, the problem is people simply get no directions on how to efficiently use their time.
---
&gt;making it easier for new players to **form** and join groups
---
I was replying to this. 
---
And what exactly are you trying to say right now? You have lost me.  
---
I don't see a problem with not giving new recruits that many roles. What do you hope to achieve by relaxing the impact roles have on corp security?
---
I'm really not sure what I'm supposed to do with a trig dreadnought. I'd imagine it would be a really handy tool for something where I need to put down 20k dps or so? But what that job is, I don't know.
---
Unironically, I believe anyone telling anyone else to eat shit if they don't like xyz is a pretty selfish and annoying thing. Like, get some fucking civility.
---
Very good points made. Id add that while there is a plethora of information out there on the web to help you learn the game, most of it is outdated. I'm a new player stuck in the same loop as you.
---
and thats exactly why you shouldnt use it
---
As someone that cut their teeth in wormholes and now lives in null, the idea of doing both at the same time is pretty much a recipe for failure. The play styles just don't really match up well. You're coming from a good newbie group, so you should have a good base skill set to allow you to contribute to either. 
---
Personally, I'd try wormholes first to see if it appeals to you. Much easier to transition to nulll from wormholes than going the other way. WH skills are much more useful to null blocs than null skills are to WHers.
---
Sure do my dude.

You clearly didn't read the last paragraph
---
i have an incommensurable amount of playtime in different MMO probably the largest part of my life and Eve is the only game where i burned out, and not just one time in just 10month   
---
it's boring, stressfull, addictive, you need to grind X hours in order to have some fun or pay with RL money that time, of course Eve isn't for everyone but if they can make it more accesible it's certainly not a bad thing for our sanity  
---
for new players being forced to wait X year to be competitive against other vet' it's not "fun" or anything else some time ago CCP believed skill injector was "something good to help newbie catch up the veteran" apparently they seem to understand thats not used by new players/low SP character, hope they continue to give SP or better, rework the SP system   
---
another thing being forced to farm in order to play (unless you think farming is funny) is just boring, it seem CCP understand that and make some change in order to make isk much easier to get but in other hand with the(probably) next asset safety change everything you have can get destroyed/stolen (i really really hope they do that)
---
PVP in eve isn't really like say... boxing unless you're in something like an abyssal arena and even then, 90% of the time, the guy that spends more on their fit is going to win. Think of it more like a game of cat and mouse or like going fishing. If you're doing PVE outside of high sec, you're the mouse. If you're travelling and trying to avoid traps or gate camps, you're the fish. The fight is mostly about catching the other guy or evading getting caught more than it is about being a good shooter.
---
I held my breath for a wall of text. Was pleasantly surprised lol.
---
*That guy* is me.  
---
I used boomer in this case because of the stupid "young generations are at fault because they lack attribute xy" argument.
---
Calling someone a boomer can be used to make fun of their stated beliefs, not just because of which generation they are from. Yes the meme came from the baby boomer generation but it has since been used in a bigger variety of contexts. 
---
But i guess you are right, i am just a not so clever zoomer with my memes and buzzwords :)
---
Yeah, good point. It's just so rarely important to game mechanics that... eh whatever eks deedeedee
---
I agree but this is a problem of clarity. As people with tons of experience this kind of thing seems obvious to us. But for newer players it's not so obvious. This is a game knowledge thing. Something that new players severely lack. That's never mind the fact that T2 hulls are going to spike again in price due to the recon changes and they were already priced out of reach for most new players.
---
I was just going for the meme, but the usual time zone would be useful.
---
Nice
---
I guess, but if I want to fly decent ships with decent fits, that becomes harder.

&gt; This would enable people who do not have the ability to blow them up but have the cash to pay someone to apply targeted awards.
---
I mean... if it is some low powered structure no random person is paying a couple bil for another random person to MAYBE blow it up, if it is a structure in use, no random person is gonna be paying billions of isk for a random person to MAYBE blow it up, especially since its likely to be defended.
---
If someone has billions and billions to pay for someone to destroy a structure, they are much more likely to actually you know... pay a group to destroy it.
---
Same for me. JonnyPew showed me how crucial a UI set up/ window layout can be. Lets not even mention the crap of an overview you receive when starting out.

The launching of a bomb provides negative speed, making it impossible to then instawarp afterwards.

Or, you know, just change how warping works so you can't just warp away the instant you want to.
---
yeeesh you need more range time.
---
thanks me too
---
Hopefully based on what they're saying too
---
- Big storage costs on Titans and other ships 
---
- Harder to hold space if you're not actively in it
---
- An attempt at rebalancing the power that corps have.
---
- Ignoring CSM for what it is,  a mega-alliance lobbyist group.
---
I did, doesn't change the argument.
---
I have a newbie I'm babysitting in corp, 8 months into the game by now. Has 4 accounts, 2 of them at just over 5m sp, can fly a lot of stuff up to bs with competent drone and core skills. Routinely dies to rats, barely escaped PvP several times thanks to my babysitting, and messes up every last fit ignoring all my tips until I show him another way to make easy isk. He could have my 75m sp main, and he'd still be shit at the game because he has no idea what he's doing, and barely puts in the effort to even listen. Having been in corp leadership positions for years, this is the overwhelming majority of newbies. Give them all the sp you want, they will have no idea what to do with it.
---
Edit: Not to mention that EVE survived so long precisely because there's the massive time gating of stuff by skills. We all saw the game fall apart when injectors came in and everything became trivial to get into.
---
Part of the problem is that so much of the game presents the illusion of safety. It’s jarring when this illusion gets shattered.
---
A group of goons shooting a variety of different guns... Tbh honest this is what I'd expect
---
:))) spotted the dude coming from wow - "checked the fleet finder" like it's hot. Did you tell them you were the tank? 
---
srsly, the time spent writing this superlong whine would ve been better spent trying to get in a half decent corp and/or reading some useful stuff on uniwiki. 
---
yea, actually, join eve uni - they ll probably sort you out, if you can tone down the attitude and entitlement :)
---

---
yeah, what suboptimalgraphs said + agility got severly nerfed in the phoebe patch anyway.
---
This.... This right fucking here... I mean, EVE is a game for those who have the patience to wait rather than getting instant gratification for very little effort.
---
On top of that, it is also a game that allows others to literally kick in your sand castle that took you a significant amount of time and effort to achieve.
---
actually some battlecruisers have better align time than some bombers... so we're  already there! ;)
---
:D
---
Meh, recons will spike and slowly stabilize. Everything else will stay largely the same, if the MER is anything to go by moon too and overall mineral production didn't get affected. Regardless, if there's anything we should be complaining about it's the lacking tutorials. And the lack of an official wiki, preferably one integrated in game somehow. Also we need to educate people on the fact that t2 is usually only 10-15% better than meta4 and that knowing how to pilot ships properly(and being willing to learn) is just as important, if not more than having the skills for t2.

Ochre first.

Two in one week, you say? That's right, we here at Capital Fusion/1HP never settle for anything less than dank frags all day every day, hence our 1 0 0 % C O N T E NT mantra.

Chossuh called me saying, "We should really host a Saturday Dunkathon for our good boyos, what do you think?" Of course, I was in. 
---
First up was some FAX/Carrier frags in Fountain, as Pando seemed more interested in chasing Ranger Regiment krabs around on stream than dealing with the caps feeding 5j from IGE Staging.

On our way to YET ANOTHER DANK FRAGFEST, our Russian hero was like ayyyyyylmao my dudes let's frag more rorqs on the way, ya? So we exited to the right for more content and fragged a goon rorq etc on a moon outside 1DQ umbrella range.

All in all, wonderful day of killmails and good times. Lots of memes and close calls. People from all over eve coming together in search of content. Eve is a fun place right now.
---
CapF is recruiting btw ;)
---
&gt; The risk/reward balance (and consequently null being a high risk/high  reward place) is not a player choice. If it was, then we wouldn't have  mechanics like CONCORD, gate guns, and so on. The risk/reward is  actively enforced by CCP and the game design. It is advertised by game  trailers. It is a very essential Eve mechanic yields an interesting  game, and has been here since Eve's creation. Yes, it is pretty much  dictated. Making null safer than hisec shouldn't be a choice in a  well-designed Eve. 
---
You are giving examples from empire space, which is explicity controlled by NPCs and thus CCP.  Of course risk : reward ratios there are controlled by CCP; a high degree of developer control and oversight is the entire selling point of hisec.
---
In nullsec, players hold SOVEREIGNTY over their space, and are supposedly able to build and control their own empires where the law is defined by what these players choose to and are able to enforce.
---
Choices made by the entities controlling nullsec are the choices that should affect nullsec in a well-designed EVE. 
---
If you feel that nullsec is defined by danger,  do you define hisec as having to be safe? Do you campaign against hisec gankers and aggressive wars, because that's not how hisec is supposed to be? 
---
&gt; I believe many people won't take the new deal involving higher risk. But  that's also a good development. It means less faucets and a more  sustainable Eve macroeconomy. Ofc some farmers will quit. But also many  from the offending side are more active with blackout than ever. 
---
So you think that EVE losing paying customers is a "good development"? 
---
Can you really not think of ways to correct economic imbalance without driving away customers? 
---
Some of the more intelligent and perceptive elements of the playerbase have been pointing out the negative effects of infinitely-respawning anomalies and multiboxing Rorqs for YEARS, and even suggesting potential solutions. It is glaringly obvious that isk and ore availability in nullsec, combined with the extremely effective tools nullsec players have for harvesting them, is quite imbalanced and serves to both marginalize incomes from hi/lowsec and undermine the intended scarcity of capitals, supercapitals, and structures.
---
While it IS true that the level of safety achieved by nullsec empires exacerbates the problem in question, given that CCP obviously relied on danger to ratters and miners as a balancing factor, undermining the integrity of the nullsec sandbox and driving away the players who live there is hardly the best way to fix the problem.  
---
 
---
&gt;None of this is about nullsec being  unprofitable or nullseccers being "farmed to death". It is merely a  taxation problem. In taxation problems you try to reach to an optimal  number which won't be too oppressive to the tax payer (so he keeps his  activities), yet high enough to match the needs of the overall system  (healthcare et al in real life, content in Eve). Average null farmer  loses something like 5% of his farm to hunters (3% in umbrella regions).  I argue that 15% is a better ratio for the health of this game; so the  risk is not too oppressive yet creates sufficient content. If it ever  becomes higher than that, you will see me arguing that the risk in null  is just too high.  
---
&gt;So think of this  as a tax you need to pay from your null farm for the very game to work.  It's no different than hisec transaction taxes etc.
---
Really, you think that players' enjoyment of the game needs to be taxed? Nullsec players are enjoying themselves more than you think they deserve, so they have to suffer enough to reduce their fun by 15% and make you happy? It's obvious you're not simply talking about ISK being "taxed", since you're demanding that this "tax" take the form of deaths and lossmails - ISK is easy to remove, but you're specifically demanding that it be removed in the way that causes maximum frustration and humiliation for the "taxpayer" (as opposed to simply reducing the output of the isk/ore faucets by the same percentage). You'd have to be pretty stupid to demand such a method of income reduction if you didn't consider the suffering it caused to be a benefit, and since you're an EVE player, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you aren't stupid.
---
Moving on...do you understand the purpose of taxes? Taxes are costs paid by all members of a community (or state, or nation, or whatever) for projects which benefit the community as a whole (at least in theory...in reality, corruption exists, but that's beside the point).  The fact that you used the word "tax" to describe nullsec miners and ratters dying to those self-styled "hunters" implies that you consider these players getting free kills from krabs to be in the best interest of EVE as a whole, which is hilariously ironic. 
---
Why, exactly, do you think that players who worked hard to establish nullsec empires, and continue to work hard to defend them and exploit their resources, owe 15% of the fruits of their labor to anyone who feels entitled to it? Why should it require far less effort to simply take something from someone than they spent producing it in the first place? Do you live on welfare in real life?
---
&gt; They already lost a great number from the hunting, content-seeking  players due to the current stagnation and safety in the last few years.  The changes are attempts to address that stagnation and safety. You'll  have to trust CCP on whether which balance is more profitable for them. 
---
Don't mix everyone who seeks content in with these so-called "hunters". Many players produce content in addition to consuming it, by seeking, taking, and otherwise facilitating actual fights which are often fun for all involved, regardless of who wins or loses. These players are the lifeblood of EVE and an asset to its general community, regardless of what areas of space they reside in.
---
On the other hand, these so-called "hunters" are parasites who consume content without generating fun for anyone except themselves, and they typically go to great lengths to avoid actually providing content. These individuals are a large part of the reason the rest of EVE is so risk-averse; with a legion of idiots roaming around constantly looking for any opportunity to force a one-sided fight and nab a free killmail, the rest of EVE was forced to adapt by denying opportunities to engage them. Imagine if these players were gone and most players roaming space were looking for actual fights rather than ganks; can you imagine how much more content would be available? How much more often do you think people would be willing to take risks or engage in fights, if doing so wasn't consistently rewarded with a quick, one-sided slaughter with no hope of victory?
---
"Stagnation" and "safety" aren't issues that need to be addressed, especially by CCP. The current "stagnation" is better described as "stability"; more coalition-level conflict certainly wouldn't be a bad thing, but gameplay isn't automatically "wrong" just because people are having fun and not losing large numbers of ships in the process. The word "stagnation" is mostly thrown around by people who don't understand what it means and just keep repeating it in hopes that CCP will make it easier for them to claim easy killmails.
---
&gt;They are not stupid. They are far more on top of what's happening than you and the other disgruntled nullsec linemembers. 
---
You're confusing us with you. Many of us have just as much experience with EVE as they do, and some of us are FAR more intelligent than them and gain much more insight from those experiences.
---
and you always say my posting is bad
---
Ricdic the infamous. Oh the EvE Market Discussion forum back then was amazing.
---
If your hole(s) got evicted and you lost everything for content.
---
Would you post about it
---
There are a few standouts still doing well.
---
That's a weak one if I've ever seen any. You just repeated something that I dismissed and gave my reason, without refuting it with your own sets of reasons. As if saying things enough times will make it true.
---
literally who does this, you're talking out your ass
---
u can evict my holes any day bb
---
Really had to zoom in to find pl, must be dead alliance.
---
&gt;srsly, the time spent writing this superlong whine would ve been better spent trying to get in a half decent corp and/or reading some useful stuff on uniwiki. 
---
What? 
---
A new player talking about the new player experience -something CCP are focused on in order to increase the abysmal player retention rate is a worthy topic of discussion here.
---
Keep your "git gud htfu" bullshit to yourself. 
---
New players will improve this game more than your bitching ever could. There's a reason CCP are focused on improving the game for them.
---
Or are you one of the ones complaining npc resists shouldn't be in the info tab cause you learned it from some randoms bio and everyone should do it that way - and are thus beyond the reach of reason based argument?
---
Actually the training missions (6 or 7 I think) as well as the 5 career agents (which each have like 5-10 missions with narrative) are a decent way to pick up the pace.
---
Awe, look at the little pedophile twist.
---
Awesome, thank you
---
Aww look at the awful person twist.
---
An amazing post, daring and provocative
---
Wormholer here. Some things I have to say about your ideas:  
---
1. The no mass limit is a double edged sword. If you are a pvp wormhole corp and you get an inactive hole with a very short and inactive chain you are out of luck and you cannot do anything about it but just wait and lose up to 1 or 2 days. On the other hand yes it brings in more risk into the gameplay and you cannot just sit and rat because the hole is not crit/closed. Maybe another way of doing this could be adding new wandering wormholes that would be quite frequent but they would be short lived and would have unlimited mass. So for example there would appear 1-n of these wormholes in your hole per day they would only last 2-4 hours and have unlimited total mass with respective mass/jump limits (no capitals in C4 or lower). They can lead to any WH classes and K space systems.
---
2. This is something I absolutely agree. It is absolutley irrational that the wormhole spawn is tied to you scanning and warping to it rather than the signature popping up.
---
3. Absolutley down to this. How can be the wormhole in critical state (even just mass) but remain open sometimes up for a several hours or even a day. Again brings in more chaos and unexpected gameplay.
---
4. C5s and C6s shouldnt get and additional K space static. I would rather say they should get another WH static.
---
5. Yeah absolutley agree. J2J connecitons must be rollable and mass for them kept as it is currently. Dont make it a tedious chore. Also the randomization on K space connecitons could be interesting.
---
Just get your tutorials done and join a small Corp: doesn't matter if it's high sec, low sec, wh, or null. Just join a small group you can chat with on discord and have fun. That's all, the rest will come.    
---
The people flying those "doctrine ships" in massive alliance battles have been around for years. And aside from a few most of them are care bears sitting in the same "umbrella" areas for years.    
---
You'll have more fun getting into a small group in high sec imo. Making friends and doing things in small groups is the key to fun in this game. Doesn't matter if your just doing level 4s with friends, roaming with a small crew, etc.   
---
And ccp is bringing in changes that will hopefully break up the null blobs. That little Corp you join and become close with might be a major part of an epic war that unseats s blob living in an area for a decade pretty soon.
---
Even Eve uni (the best major group) won't be the same as joining a small Corp doing whatever you want.
---
one does not exclude the other
---
However this is true, would the next “volley” technically still be accurate? Seems like a lot of hull for blasters but I’m not familiar with numbers off the top of my head
---
Sorry bud, I'm just following your lead. I would ask what you're going to do when your friends find out about how you like to fuck under age boys, but I think we both know you dont have any of those
---
Funny thing is, the career agents, aka tutorial missions, actually tell you among other things that you're never safe and even make you kamikaze a ship into a gas silo. Says a lot about the effectiveness of the NPE as an intro to the game...
---
Lol. They will never reach the size of null corps/alliances. They are there for 2 reasons. Good isk and/or pvp content. But the good isk is in limited supply in WH space as opposed to null sec where it is readily available. Yeah and the community will not become krabbing above pvp. Cuz of that reason I mentioned above krabs will leave because there wont be anything to do for them.
---
Bruh that isn’t what i asked
---
I just had flashbacks of my EIB. Thanks.
---
....I’m confused in the two types of ammo loaded and the 2 empty guns

Same reason why they removed walking in stations

 Sorry  bud, I'm just following your lead. I would ask what you're going to do  when your friends find out about how awful of a person you are,  but I think we both know you dont have any of those
---
aren't they separated for a reason? like Horde is the elite supercap alliance and PL is the newbro subcap group?
---
IIRC it wasn’t just that they removed it, it was that previously CCP had said if it was removed there would be a replacement, and it was announced to be removed and no replacement suggested

---
Try keeping the probe launcher offline until you need it? Uses alot of resources
---
Ya know what, we outta get all the null blocks to start having massive fights in HS just to freak out pubbies. It could be epic! Fly to their asteroid belts and mission sites and just have a massive fucking battle.
---
They did admit on several occasions that UI is terrible. At least they know. Now fix the damn thing
---
Assuming I understand it correctly, the mechanic is if you roll your static, the new dig will spawn in your window, but if you don’t scan/warp to it, it will never spawn. If you warp to it, it spawns in a “invisible” state, which is what happened to your friend. Hole is there but no sig, BUT after a certain amount of time there becomes a chance to spawn, with a mathematical “guarantee” to spawn after like 11 hours or something. If you jump the hole the WH spawns the other side + sig pops
---
Muninns online in Ns, blap nags in wormholes? Volleying dreads? Sounds fun
---
All of wormhole space is not occupied. Maybe only 50% of it has any active structures in it. Out of those quite a lot are PvP groups in C2s, C4s. Some of them are just indy/PI holes in low class WHs. The only real place that is generating isk in WHs are C5s and C6s. Those also are not 100% occpied so your math is... Hm.... WRONG.
---
A medium gang for me is 10 people. Is that bad?
---
And yet, basically ever fleet needs frigates and dessies. They have a role and they don't take long to skill into.
---
This. And communication is key so liking the people you fly with is ideal
---
Max fitting skills including rigging?
---
I really enjoyed selling mine at a “cheap” local price that was a bil profit for what I made it for :) thanks krabs
---
These are some extremely valid points. Thank you for your feedback.
---
As a more veteran player myself.
---
Gate guns are designed to prevent players from camping chokepoints unless they have specialized ships. Trust me, you would rather have gate gun mechanics than not.  BUT you are totally right that we may not teach to the IMPLICATIONS of those mechanics.
---
Death mechanics do require a lot of travel. This is true. But they are as they are to not allow abuse.  You don't want your enemy getting instant reinforcements.
---
I agree. There should be more public fleets up. We need better tools to advert fleets to literally anyone. I can only see fleets that have set me as blue in the past.  I would also like to have a tool to somehow verify someone has a microphone. Having someone on comms in my fleet is much much better than not. 
---
The lack or direction is intentional.  This is an engame MMO. I don't see how we can do much more than have a "hey try this".  We already have that. It's called the agency.
---
Targets in Eve are always trying to hide there presence. The ones you see often are there because they are a trap.  A lot of the game centers around finding the fight you know you can win and the deception of pretending you are that fight to another player.  That is a part that really adds to the richness of the game.  Unfortunately, a new character will have a hard time finding a winning fight because of this.  That's why it is so important for new guys to tag along with vets in a good Corp.
---
Again, I appreciate your feedback.  Fly safe.
---
That was the first thing I tried to do when I first played Eve too.
---
How this low hanging fruit is still here is both amazing and horrifying. 
---
The community has been saying it for years. The CSM has been saying it for years.
---
i'd hate the playerbase too, you give one group everything they want for 3 years and you make one change that isn't in their favor and they do a 180 on the foruns
---
Oh man, I miss drake fleets. Then again, that was back in the day when a small number of dreads couldn't curbstomp your entire drake fleet at practically no risk to themselves.
---
Me too, thanks

---
Best of luck to you
---
With passion.
---
Lucky init weren’t involved in the planning.
---
Heavy missiles are still paying for 2011.
---
They're all mad about blackout (no local in nullsec) and upcoming cyno changes. Neither of those things will affect a new player.
---
I don't mean to be rude, but your first sentence literally proves his point. 
---
I have introduced Eve to many, many gamer friends and they all bounced off because they couldn't grind out their skills. They saw skilltraining as a thinly veiled way to suck more subscription time out of them, gating the "good" content behind essentially a time wall. 
---
And they aren't entirely wrong. Look at the Magic 14; these are skills that everyone says will help you, in every ship you fly. True enough. But if those skills didn't exist, would the game suffer? Do we gain anything by having MY standard fit Tristan have more cap than YOUR identical Tristan just because I trained some random skill? 
---
Ironically enough for all the shit they get, the 2 friends I have introduced since Injectors and Alphas launched are still playing, because they actually can grind out some achievable goals. Not efficiently, maybe not what we consider fun, but they undocked and subbed.
---
someone needs to train their gunnery skills

I’ve enjoyed doing level 4 security missions, seems like decent Isk if I can convert these LP... My Gila has been great, but will a Rattlesnake with the same MO (shields and drones) be better or worse for level 4 security missions?
---
Basically, is a rattlesnake kinda the next step up from a Gila?
---
Also, are either of these ships worth a shit in WH/Null/PvP?  I’ve literally only mined and done sec missions.
---
Also, one last thing, if I join a Corp, my days of doing Sec missions are probably over, right?
---
Thanks everyone!
---
Thanks for your help!
---
Harder than ganking ventures tbqh

Soooo is ur whole gayme 2 go on red it postes and just bitch about some shorthand grammar, not really contributing to the conversation? Lord go back to mining your shitty vedspar in highsec.
---
It's all about perspective.
---
Truly ahead of it's time.
---
 This is by far one of the best suggestions. This game can be a lot of fun. On of the best times i had was our late night dive bar, we rolled wormholes and baited fights. 
---
I would also suggest always practicing under your weight.. sure, you can fly a leshak, that doesn't mean you can't have a blast with a tanky vexor.
---
If you are worried about skill, fit a fun cruiser and risk the 30 mil. T1 frigates and destroyers are a great way to get on juicy kills and you can still make that pivotal scram on a target.

---
Pick a race (preferably whichever race is used most in your corp/alliance/coalition's doctrines) and focus on skilling for its cruisers. Get racial cruiser 5, max your skills for that race's medium weapon systems, train up (and eventually max) any non-weapon skills that apply to that race's cruisers (tank, fitting, drone, navigation, etc), and pick up whatever other skills you need for the T2 and T3 cruiser hulls.  At some point during this process, consider training your racial battlecruiser to 5 - it will use the same weapons systems as the cruisers, so all you need is the racial battlecruiser skill. Bombers are also pretty much always useful, but they won't really synch well with the other stuff you're training; they're cloaky frigates that use battleship-sized missiles.
---
Once that is done, you have two choices: 
---
If you are not willing to pay $15 a month, you should probably skill towards a Rorqual and join a low/nullsec entity that uses Rorqs and can protect them. If you want to operate in lowsec...ask someone else, I don't know where to point you. If you want to operate in nullsec, you want to join Goonswarm, Test, or Panfam. Goonswarm is the biggest and most powerful of the three, but it is the EVE equivalent of Fortnite and is widely hated by the rest of the community. Test is a great choice; they're not as big as Goonswarm, but they're a solid second place and feature considerably fewer of the type of player that makes everyone hate Goons. Panfam is the "worst" of the three choices, but it definitely has its charm - it's kind of like the wild west of EVE; you'll experience the lowest degree of safety but the highest degrees of content and independence. If you can't decide, just join Goons; you can always leave later if you can't stand it.
---
If you ARE willing to pay $15 a month, you can do whatever the F you want to do at this point. You have solid cruiser skills and can find a place in pretty much any fleet - even capital fleets want HICs, which are T2 cruiser hulls. If you are willing to pay ANOTHER $15 a month, or you make enough ISK to plex a second account, this would be a good time to start working on a capital alt (which should be on a seperate account). I would train this alt for carriers first, if you're interested in carrier ratting (which is quite nice isk, assuming the blackout ever ends). If you are not interested in carrier ratting, consider training for dreads first, then carrier/fax.
---
Also, make sure to check out PI, manufacturing, and bluepring copying; they can potentially be solid sources of semi-passive income, though they'll require SP and ISK investments to get started.
---
I don't think there's a silver bullet for this problem, more like a few different things that could potentially increase those numbers by a small percentage that would add up to a worthwhile investment of development time.  
---
Things like reworking PvE to be more interactive, creating more interesting lore echoing success of mission chains like the Blood-Stained Stars epic arc. Increasing the fun and immersion factor of things like exploration and hacking. Maybe some fun Hisec PvP variant of FW complexes in order to give new players a place to bash their heads against one another until one succumbs. How about reworking corporate recruitment so third party websites more easily integrate into the UI so corporations can create awesome propaganda and recruitment material.  
---
The big, obvious question you have to approach is - "why would people choose this game over many, many others?".
---
Speak with noob and you will see. They dont give a shit about stagnation but 100% more to catch their own goal.
---
what hole(s) are you talking about even?
---
No, few players have been working for years at getting a titan (like me) .. .the vast majority just inject and buy ISK (salty bitter-vet)
---
didn't you do that in Perimeter and got so much PTSD from it that you just formed a trade donut?
---
Change is bad for those addicted to the status quo.
---
What are you training, titan v lol?
---
Amarr May have more HP but I believe the point about caldari drones is they’re *almost* as tanky, but instead of armor HP it’s shield, which will regen

I think these are all valid points though most people in this sub will tell you to suck it up like the rest of us.
---
I agree that a lot of hurdles new players face are because of CCP's general incompetence in designing solid robust intuitive systems. And not because inherent game complexities that some are just not cut out for, like the autists on this sub like to think.
---
So the problems are not so easy to fix. The devs simply are not capable. But there is another far worse problem. CCP believes their own bullshit about changing the world and this image of academic tough guys etc. They think eve is something 'more' than just a game. They can have their little delusions but I think it has shaped some of (or lack of) the design decisions they've made.
---
But.. eve at its core can be a fantastic experience. The core systems, tools and concepts can be used to create something magical. But like you've noticed, the game design is far too weak to guide you into those experience. You really have to do it yourself, make your own plan and go out and do it. Or you know just say fuck this and not deal with all this crap and play a better game.

I've heard of the Markee Dragon person but not of the others and I don't even really know what the Markee person is "famous" for. I'm not really into following the fame of people, it doesn't interest me in the slightest.
---
It’d either turn into cheaper ratting ships or push people to capitals for high class space. I see nothing wrong with this and I haven’t wormholed in a while
---
They need to recategorize and rename the different areas of space.
---
member of PL who wants to get gud....
---
RIP Dust 514
---
Link highsec lossmail to explain your tears.
---
If you are in GSF, you and I are both part of it whether you like it or not lol
---
Was great fun Xavier
---
Pandemic horde has holes now apparently lul
---
Counter point, while I agree with you, most of the isk isn’t being made in c3s and down is it? It’s probably much more in....*groans*....c4s....and c5s primarily right? Aren’t there only &lt;500 c5s?
---
In sorry I can’t hear you over the 20 minute updating wallet payout
---
I'm confused. Did Capital Fusion catch this titan or did Snuffed Out? or did Initiative? and what alliance is Cap F in?
---
I am in gsf as of about 9 months ago. So I guess I am lol
---
RORQS DONT SPAWN AVENGERS?
---
Hey least there FOF barghests are getting nerfed
---
&gt; The thing that broke EVE for me was the cyno changes and Drifter fleets.
---
Don’t forget that probably wasn’t made in c3s and down, was probably *mostly* c5s and c6s
---
That's just the foreskin.
---
no man's sky just had a decent patch
---
o/, welcome to Eve &amp; thanks for sharing your experience,
---
In your opinion is the experience difficult in itself ( content too hard for new players ) or is this the lack of information which is hurting ( lack of information about content ) ?
---
You already gave clues but I feel like some newcomers fall in the wrong side of the Eve cliff and there isn't even a signpost.
---
For example Low Sec and "griefing" : we blow up ( or try to ) everyone in our corner of the galaxy ( except fellow alliance and militia members). Including neutral and innocent newbros. But then most of us always convo a newbro we killed and even reimburse their ship. Hell blowing up people is how low-seccers recruit people.
---
About the travel time and price of pvp, it's also a thing which normally your corp takes care of. Keep in mind that Eve has really different type of pvp. Null Sec is more nation level warfare with huge fleets but more specialized groups also exist inside those nations (SIGs). In low-sec, it's more solo and small gang. WH is small gang too but has its own flavour.
---
Newbros' ships cost nothing. For the price of a pirate frigate, you can offer 100 T1 frigates. For the vets in your corp, offering your first ships is pocket money. And if your alliance is pvp oriented, normally their staging is right in the middle of the blood and fire, so no need of 15 jumps until finding content.
---
I don't know about the rest of the game but for low sec, the game should give a set of rules/infos to newbros like "always convo your killer", "if you are entering this space, take the time to read this or this" " watch this video about the rock/paper/scissor of Eve pvp". A bit like EU4 deals with explanations along your game progression.
---
Your daughter is wise, you should listen to her, PI is the key of Eve 😉
---
Looks like classic shooter's spodbrain to me: holes everywhere.
---
*unzips pants*
---
I read this in Rorschach's voice.
---
It’s old you’ll figure it out.
---
Flavor in, flavor out.
---
When are you joining moon in capF? You know you belong there :P
---
Its got big guts!
---
RIP AND TEAR!
---
I miss being a nano drake and killing canes.
---
Yes, offline either the launcher or the weapons. Can't have both at once. I tried that as well...
---
Fight or scan, not both.
---
Rote Kapelle shit posting at its finest.
---
Also,
---
Ur mom
---
Alternatively, you could avoid posting negative comments. What is the purpose of telling another person to not post a video of their EVE content?
---
That is not nice.
---
No. Like... you need fuel blocks if you want your citadel online and functioning properly, if your online or not your pos/citadel uses fuel. Not talking PLEX at all. Like your Titan uses x amount of fuel per day, as running costs. Stuff that you buy in game with isk.  If it runs out of fuel you’ve gotta put in a chunk of it to restart the massive engines or something (like re-onlining a station service module)
---
You might be a little less so if you joined us for frags sometime ;)  
---
This one was caught by a combination of efforts from Horde (with a great deal of it coming from the Blops sig specifically) and Snuffed. Although, it took a team to make it happen. For instance, Poppi and myself (CapF) and Flores started scanning wh's immediately following downtime. It took four total hours of scanning more than 200+ wh sigs to map the entrances that made this frag possible
---
Literally. Goddamnit, I can't unsee this.
---
all of this is true, and has been true since i started the game all those years ago :)
---
Still the community is dissatisfied like 90% of the time.
---
exactly :)
---
I recall that for POS code, too
---
That's the total skill queue mate...
---
Come back to TKE soon. Maybe we actually fight then. :)
---
..what tears?
---
The only code loss I have to code was as a noob, and I got 7mil loot from his wreck which was big money to me at the time. I was pretty chuffed tbh. 
---
I'm criticising those with a risk averse playstyle (code) saying there's no danger in null. There's a reason you guys do nothing but kill noobs and freighters in high sec. Remember that.
---
My friends love me because I'm awful. We spend our days ouring faggots like you for being pedos
---
I think the commitment and decision paralysis of having to join a corp puts many new players off. This is just a hypothesis though, I don't know what data CCP have on this.
---
Right.  YOU know.  But the hole doesn't know.  The point was that there is no way to both make rolling unpredictable to add risk when the players intend to farm while also allowing players to roll to find content.
---
Promise to not bring caps and I'll come back. Promise.
---
I saw it so you had to see it too, you're welcome &lt;3
---
All they need to do is take EVE and add NMS's planetary play and it would be perfect
---
Logi is very important to almost any fleet, logi ships are fitted to repair friendly ships mid fight (most of the time shield because most fleets are shield ranked in the current meta and to standardize logi so a fleet won’t need both shield and armor repairs) In mid sized fleet fights (20+) When the logi of a fleet dies the fleet will die very very quickly (this is why logi is targeted). It is memed on because you don’t get on any of the killmails due to you being a unarmed ship (lots of logi put 1 drone on to “whore” on the killmails). So it’s kinda a meme because it is one of the most important roles in a fleet but no one wants to fly it
---
I initially read the title as "allowance".
---
So accelerate new player training, these skills everybody hates on make a difference in a fight, if you dont have them it effects everything from what you can fit on you ship to how those mods  function. 
---
Taking them out is another nail in eves once great complex web of choices. Yes you can train other things, but you'll suffer in overall performance to skip them, that's a choice you the player have to make.
---
&gt;Tbh honest
---
Atm machine
---
Pyfa shows with all 5 skills and everything online you're 149% over CPU.  Like everyone said, weapons online or the probe launcher, not both.
---
Meh
---
I enjoyed it up until the iron sights on everything patch. Technologically advanced enough to have clones, no ACOGs.
---
Not dead. Maybe more challenging but I only started flying a solo bomber after the changes were made. I love my bomber. I bomb everything regardless of size or ability to kill it solo. I'm shocked at the things that die under my bombs. 
---
Always count on stupid. Launch the bomb, triple paint the target, cross fingers, run away if there is trouble.
---
Little targets usually just pop. Big ones run away about 70% of the time and the other 30% - I run away :)
---
Heart pounding excitement when it happens. Sweats and shakes... every.... single.... bomb run!
---

---
Didn't even bother to activate PANIC or use it's indy core. :(
---
&gt; rock/paper/scissor
---
As a newbro, what do you mean? never heard of it
---
or maybe, just maybe, coding the feature isn't the problem from ccp's point of view?
---
afaik, ccp had not said that coding this was a problem, only cosmicpenguin said so. ccp said that the bookmarks becoming invalid is something they don't want. if they now changed their mind about that, maybe they'll implement this at some point as well. but there might be other game design reasons they don't want this. i'm not a game designer, i'm a coder. i know how to code. designing a fun game is not my skillset.
---
The worst part is that Eve's UI is super powerful and when you know how it works and what is important works incredibly well imo. The default setup just an impenetrable brick wall of useless and manages to be both complicated and unhelpful. Gives an impression of a game with a terrible UI rather than just a game with a complex UI.
---
When you entered Eso, most of us were in Detorid. We formed munnins for fight that didn't happen. When we were going home our FC heard about drake fleet in Eso. He decided to take it, and told us that op is over, and whoever doesn't feel the going on to Eso, it may dock up and stay in Immensea. He also ordered no further drops on your fleet. I don't know what happened next, because I had to dock up because of real life, but from the way BR looks I guess it was fun.
