ESL: English (as a) Second Language. Equivalent to what you call a non-native speaker. 
---

---
I totally understand ESL speakers mixing up past, present, and future tenses. I totally understand mixing up English sentence structure. I *don't* understand how someone can use `u` and `you` in the same sentence -- it makes more sense for the person to use `u` twice, or use `you` twice. 
---
Which is why I don't believe OP is a non-native speaker.

What about Logi on Killmails, aka Killmail 2.0
---
We were promised it last year.
---
Oof, point on the doll where a null bloc touched you.
---
It's fairly useless to talk about what should be removed without also talking about what should come to replace it. I'm not opposed to the idea of removing attributes and their associated implant sets, but what will remain in their stead?
---
One option is to simply have everyone train at a fixed rate with no implants to speed it up. This seems like a good idea, but it is just going to frustrate the playerbase by removing the ability to speed up training. It will also remove a decent ISK sink in the form of training implants. My suggestion is that either we get a new set of training implant, maybe 1%/3%/5% reduced training time implants or some such (numbers preliminary, just used as a demonstration). One other suggestion that I've seen before is to add implants which reduce the training time for skills in certain categories. Eg. a set of implants to speed up Spaceship Command training or Gunnery training.
---
I don't think we should remove the ability for players to reduce training time in exchange for ISK, personally. It's a system that seems to have worked decently well without overly punishing newer players (since newer players are usually training lower-level skills with lower multipliers).
---
Multitrack drifting?!
---
&gt; Maybe add LP to the market?
---
Almost certainly wouldn't sink anything close to what learning implants do.
---
If it's anything like the new taxes you'll just avoid using the market altogether because a 5% cut is what motivates people to train the connections skill to V.
---
&gt;Or maybe creating more navy and pirate implant sets!
---
That's the "great ideas are welcome" part...
---
Now all you need to do is make a set that is as cheap as a set of +4s, as ubiquitous as them, and isn't blindingly overpowered for its cost.
---
I'll wait.
---
&gt;Or even adding pirate BCs and pirate/navy destroyers!
---
Pretty much every non-welp pod is packing +4s. Do you think every non-welp ship is going to be an equivalent faction ship of similar cost? Because I highly doubt it.
---
I can't stress this enough. They're still here **because there is no viable alternative sink**. You cannot just remove the sink. The damn place will overflow and create huge gameplay problems across the board. Find a real, workable replacement before you ask for the problem to go away.

Stuff tends to move every few weeks. Get enough of those and it adds up to several trades happening a day. I had to get a 2nd toon for more trade slots to handle the volume of buy/sell orders.

I disagree with the category based implants. They're essentially just as complicated to noobs. If we are getting rid of attributes let's not replace them with something just as annoying.
---

---
I was the same for a long time, And it's true that the game can be played quite reliably and enjoyably from a single character.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
However, to some degree this is tolerable - however after trying out multi boxing you see the benefits significantly outweigh the niche "i'm a single character dude" title. Information is key, and actions which can be reproduced easily for extra reward is a no brainer. 
---
Ultimately, the uses of a second account are dependent on the kind of activities you pursue. Activities which require constant input and attention will  be trickier to pull off, and if your tactical management isn't all cracked up, it might be a hindrance to you.
---
However, for things like mining and mission running where inputs are often few and far between, having more characters doing this simultaneously can produce tremendous results. Your days worth of mission running will net you N Isk, if you run two accounts that could go up to N x 2, and so on and so forth. The majority of the time doing activities like this are waiting for things to blow up, moving around - so why not make the most of it?
---
I don't understand this but I support it
---
performance plants like in slots 6-10. Make losing a pod a big deal - incentivize people to actual have pvp implants at a lower level.
---
Any SP gain advantage that can be purchased for isk will negatively impact newer players. That is why giving everyone the equivalent of +5 implants and perfect remaps (2700sp/hour) is the best solution. 
---
When clone grades were in the game said "I don't want to fly small ships because if I die and get podded it costs 15 mil isk!" Now days some new players don't want to PvP because the cost of implants (40 mil isk for two +4s) is prohibitive for a new player to earn quickly. Clone grades prevented PvP. Attribute Implants prevent just as much PvP. 
---
Let the new player spend their hard earned isk on ships to get blown up instead of trying to play catch up. The best solution is get rid of attribute implants and give everyone the equivalent of a full set of +5s with perfect remaps.
---

---

---
The problem is severe enough that the players, CSM, and CCP need to work together to find a solution. All you have done in your post is complain I single-handedly didn't come up with a perfect solution. I promise I am far from the best person to come up with the ideas.
---
What ideas would you like to see? What ideas would other like to see?
---
The training implants cause new players to be very risk adverse. The first thing a new player is told to do is slot +4 training implants because of how big increase in training speed it makes, but 100m isk is a lot for a new player. Then that new player is afraid to do anything risky like traveling to low or null etc because of the implants. I think they need to go, while combat implants can stay.
---
That's certainly a good solution as well. You have me convinced.
---
Can't wait to watch. I just started playing a few weeks ago, and these two are in my top 3 favorite YT content creators.
---
also just as extra information the reason you want an alt to web your ship is to make it warp faster
---

---
Easy, you use a common development tactic for networking: Trust nothing, Not even blues or yourself. Eve is big, setting up in a dead end system with no one is possible, and a bot doesn't sleep, it doesn't get bored, it doesn't need to care about lost ticks, it just docks up. waits 1 hour for regular humans to naturally get bored and then go back out again.
---
Also, Nullsec still gets fights, but how often, do you remember the last time since the black out that you got in a fight that didn't end in you getting alpha'd? do you know if the FC you used didn't call up a buddy of his in a neutral alliance and plan a good fight? Did you bash a structure of a small alliance?
---
Implants are not an isk sink, they are an LP sink. The isk a player spends on implants is bit removed grin the game it just transfers hands
---
Well, the phrase "pick your battles" certainly applies in eve. But in this case, it's a matter of someone who only fights those who can't fight back and then retreats at the first sign of retaliation. 
---
I'm talking about the risk-averse twats who fly into a region literally controlled by a massive super power who only prey on the weak, and get all pikachu-face when they realize that miner has friends, and then bitching about it on Reddit when they die.
---
Like, why even bother coming? You *knew* this would happen.
---
Although the only exception to this rule is when those spineless hunters actually manage to kill somebody who is AFK and doesn't tell anybody that they're being attacked.
---
But to answer your question; you don't. You're either someone who puts high personal value into space pixels and runs for the hills, or you're somebody who just doesn't care and dies quietly, maybe even putting a "gf" in local.
---
Or you have a cyno ready with friends on the other side.

None of those have engines on the moving parts.

Thanks. I've corrected things.

Yeah you get great views of outside cloud ring from outer ring! I remember once I went on a stratop through both, it was awesome

This can be easily fixed by giving people at least one jump clone by default (lvl 0 infomorph) and letting people swap clones with out a timer in stations the same way you can do it in citadels
---
Not much.  And it took me like a week of moving near downtime, while using an alt to scout.  But it was fun.

PvP doesn't happen at convenient times in Eve Online. Any time you undock you consent to PvP. What you are arguing for is that they should take hours of less SP gain to simply play the game. That's not how it should be. 
---
The solution is simple: Remove attributes and attribute implants. Give everyone the equivalent SP gain of +5s with perfect remaps (2700 SP/hour). Now the new players can play the game and gain SP at a fantastic rate. Everyone wins.
---
Cynos are by far not the nr 1 issue in the game. There isnt anything wrong with them. You just dont realise the consequence of changing it. It would make everyone into Rorq miners cause when the big gangs come for you they will kill even supers before you can react.
---
And with no local that means that its gg, you might as well hang up a sign saying "were out of business". 
---
Stop thinking you can balance big gang with small gang, you cant.
---
Not exactly a "force multiplier" when a single carrier has 20 times the HP and 3x the damage of a ferox. That's just "more force".
---
What if training implants were given the same effect as the implant that gives you the golden pod, making them persist after death? AFAIK they use the same slots as regular implant sets so there is still a penalty for using them (you can't use implant sets without ripping out your training implants or switching pods), but you don't have to worry about losing your training set on death.
---
Any isk a new bro spends trying to catch up is isk they aren't spending on ships to get blown up in. everyone the equivalent of +5 implants and perfect remaps (2700sp/hour) and find other ways to handle the LP sink.
---
Awesome. Thank you for these.
---
I don't have data, but I imagine a fair bit of the attribute implants that are purchased are to re-buy PvP lost implants. It also still creates incentives new players to spend isk on catching up, not ships to get blown up in.
---
&gt;I don't have data, but I imagine a fair bit of the attribute implants that are purchased are to re-buy PvP lost implants.
---
Exactly, so making implants persist upon death would fix a lot of that and lead to people being less risk-averse.
---
&gt;It also still creates incentives new players to spend isk on catching up, not ships to get blown up in.
---
In theory, sure. In practice, not so much. A Basic set is only 40Mn, which a new player can make in under an hour with only \~2 weeks worth of training. My experience as a new player, and my experience helping get new players into the game, is that you don't have this feeling of "having to catch up" in most new players. Not to mention that the difference the implants provide is pretty minimal on the early, low-multiplier skills.
---
Fof Raven is totally viable, dont listen to him
---
Hey feed us kills, by all means.
---
The issue with persist implants is it will massively reduce the demand and throw the LP market out of whack without a suitable replacement.
---
I live in null.  When you look at the map of ships killed in the last hour, hisec is lit up like a Christmas tree and null is fairly quiet.  Is it mainly gankers? Outside FW systems I mean .

They have been working... you're literally quoting CSM minutes of them working on it.

The fact that nobody has come up with a workable solution, **including you**, should really tell you something.

If not a full removal, at least off better options for remapping. One year is a long ass freaking time to be locked into a decision.

They just have the engine trail turned off on the moving engines.

Why do u need a zero sum here?  It’s just remove an overly complicated unfun mechanic that literally everyone agrees should go
---
Because you can't just pull something out. You have to define what the result will be. Ie. OP has stated that the result of this would be everyone training as though they had perfect remaps and +5 implants, at 2700SP/hr.
---
Right what’s wrong with that
---
&gt;highlight everyone in local chat. Any players jumping into system later will stand out as unselected.
---
Incredible. Thank you.
---
Not as much as you would think. When looking at a skill queue, the categories are right there and a "gunnery" implant would directly affect all gunnery skills. The issue is that there are 20ish categories, and only so many slots. If you make a skill training implant slotless (can go in any slot, but you can only fit 5) that might help to mitigate some of the confusion. And if you make low level implants swappable, a newb is more likely to learn how the whole implants mechanic works. L1 implants can be swappable and L2 and up are permanent and destroyed when removed. Should also make it so you can't duplicate implants, so if you already have a gunnery implant plugged in, you can't add another one. Just a thought. I could be an idiot, but this is based a little bit on my personal experience also.
---
That short period after decloaking and before the target's destruction is when a SKIN is most valuable as a brand asset.  You've got the target's undivided attention!

---
I had a good fight today, another yesterday, and another the day before that and so on. No one is getting alpha'd. The FC is me, or one of my other long time friends in this game who don't have contacts like that. We don't bash structures. Small gang pvp corp based in a c2 btw.

Removing remapping is the easier step.

Removing implants does introduce the LP problem. The solution to LP stuff is converting implants to boosters (argued by suitonia).
---
What about Skill Yourself?
---
I worry that would be too much SP into the game, most actual pilots arent always in +5/perfect remap. 
---
I would suggest letting people under 10 or 20m sp (i.e newbros) get the full 2700 sp/hr and slowly scale it down, but I can see that making for annoying maths.

As a viewer it was very difficult to follow your piloting decisions. The most i could comprehend in the video was purely based off your UI notifications and HUD ewar icons.

Rarely as a viewer was I ever able to see the big picture of the grid you’re fighting on and earn a sense of situational awareness. I feel as though that may have been one of the reason you were caught by that first mega mjd.

---
Doesn’t really matter, unless you’re gonna do faction warfare.  Caldari state is great cause it lowers your broker fees a bit if you put up buy or sell orders in Jita, but if all you care about is LP, it’s tough cause the value of the stuff changes so often.

Just try and keep all four factions above -5 if you plan on freely travelling around high sec space.  I know I learned the hard way flying through a route and arriving in a pod cause amarr Navy npcs didn’t like me flying through their space.  If you are doing L4 missions, reject as many of the ones that require to to shoot empire factions... ie: if you’re doing caldari missions, reject as many that ask you to shoot gallente ships in missions as you can without pissing off your mission givers.  
---
There used to be more benefits to rep... like you could only install clones and anchor POS’s in empire space with really high faction years ago...
---
Now it’s not that big a factor.
---
No other trade hub is as important as Jita, high Caldari navy standing also makes selling at jita cheaper.
---
It still punishes new bros. They should spend their isk on ships to get blown up in, not in trying to gain SP faster. 
---
There are so many other things that can be added to the game to create new LP sinks. Be creative! This is a great opportunity to really change up and add some chaos to Eve! Give us new modules, implants, ships, deployables, etc. Put more sand in the sandbox. Don't take the easy way out with a half measure solution.

Carrier can do l5s.
---
This would require a larger capital investment though, as generally you would want multiple carriers spread out amongst the various systems you may get missions in. While this is less important after capitals were allowed to use gates, not being seen on a gate is a major increase to your safety. Most of the time a carrier on d-scan will be assumed to be pos'd up, so you do gain some safety from peoples laziness.
---
Most carriers just rat in nullsec at anoms. You could probably fairly easily find a nullsec corp that would let you join to rat out there.
---
The lack of damage bonus will definitely reduce the amount of money you make. Generally with anom ratting, you don't really use the kind of bonuses the chimera gets, but it is pretty fucking sexy after the redesign.
---
Main thing is to just not be seen. If you're seen and caught you will die. Always align and be dscanning for combat probes.
---
Also, since you left, they have dramatically changed how carriers work, now they are much more active and interesting.
---

If you do a lot of trading it's worth it to raise your standings with the factions/corps that run major trade hubs. Even though a lot of trade is going to be moving to player stations with the tax increases, it's still worth it to get these standings up as much as you can.

That doesn't make it right. Injectors existing and the issues injectors have caused on the economy is a poor excuse to justify an unrelated mechanic that punishes new players. 
---
What does having a purchasable SP implant/booster do for Eve? It sinks LP. That's it! That's all the good it does. Just skip it and move on. Come up with with thoughtful and meaningful additions to Eve that will sink just as much, if not more, LP. Replace a poor system that punishes new players by creating incentives with repeated isk being spent on implants/boosts instead of ships, with a system that enriches all players and the sandbox that is Eve.
---
I see that we disagree with the best solution, but please work with the CSM and CCP to remove attributes and attribute implants. You have a few months before the next summit. Prove to us the CSM isn't worthless and can get something meaningful done that everyone agrees should be done.

It's not really about not wanting to pay with others. It's more about the fact that you would then have to share the profits. There are things that warrant that, but a lot of EVE PVE is very simple and easily done by one person controlling multiple ships.

For a general trial log into the test server so you can play around with the mechanics of the carrier. Go ham in MO- or w/e else pvp system there are.

In pvp it works well you will just do abit less dps then the Nid. PvE also works but tic will be lower.

Over all no carrier is bad just what role it being used will make it better then others.

As far as solo activities, you can blitz lvl 5's(although certain missions are better than others and you will want a dedicated puller toon so you can decline the bad missions without a standings hit), do null sec anoms, and PVP.

As far as bonuses go, you could get away with using a Chimera instead of a nid/thanny, although it would be sub-optimal. The faster align time and higher damage of a nid make it a much better choice for both PvE and small scale PvP. The Chimera does have more tank, but not to a degree that makes it more safe.
---
For fitting, go for damage and tracking mods. You could also use an NSA, but with the new warp disabling effect I would not recommend it. Use sensor boosters instead.
---
How not to die in lowsec? Use dscan and watch for probes. Check the people who enter system on zkill, and if they are on cap kills, dock up. Dont run your missions in systems with high activity(i.e not huola). 
---
Hope this helps
---
Now compare it to an enforcer. Dead on
---
The cake is a lie.
---
&gt; unrelated mechanic
---
You said the problem is new players spending ISK for accelerated SP. I said ISK for accelerated SP already exist. That means your problem won't be solved if you removed SP implants/booshers. Which makes injectors pretty related to the context of your own discussion.
---
Meanwhile the thing you propose as a problem isn't the main problem with attribute implants at all. The problem is new players avoiding PvP to not risk their implants. Now that, is actually solved with boosters.
---
&gt; It sinks LP. That's it! That's all the good it does.
---
Mate those implants by a really high margin the main LP to ISK converter in FW. Lots do FW. Guess fuck FW?
---
&gt;  Generally with anom ratting, you don't really use the kind of bonuses the chimera gets
---
Chimeras can tank quite a bit harder than Thanatos/Nid when ratting fit. Might be a bit more forgiving to fly.
---
So this is what its like to talk to a retarded infant...
---
Bruh.
---
Learn to scan and evade trouble and then go poke at wh corps. We always ALWAYS need to haul metric asstons of shit around and we have more than enough money to pay you for it.
---
thei're*
---
And that wasn't all of the Leshaks. There were at least eight. Those were just the ships that got on killmails (two Guardians escaped as well).
---
Why so mean? We both wormholers
---
It's worth mentioning, when they told me they were leaving, I told them that they could take as long as they needed, which is the norm for corps leaving on good terms with us.  Fast forward to a few days ago, and I get a slew of pings with screenshots of their 2ic giving intel (albeit out of date) on a sotiyo they sold.  That of course got them kicked and blacklisted from Legacy.  Fortunately for us, we knew some unanchoring timers and picked up some citadels that they left behind.  Add in these recent losses and I'm having a pretty good week.
---
Please do it in a corp
---
Nothing is more satisfying than mining a gas site after a corp mate cleared the rats out for you.
---
Just be on d-scan or be able to afford to loose your shit when a sabre appears next to you
---
Love you Squishy!
---
Pee is stored in the balls
---
\+5 is a bit too much. 4 is a good balance. Alot of newer players rock 3s and older ones 5s and I mean I dont think the high SP would mind -1 especially when we get so much free SP.
---
As a new LP sink how about the event boosters. Like pyro and such.
---
Okay, so make them persist *AND* also put in a new LP sink for Navy Destroyers or whatever.
---
Best of both worlds.
---
Eve truely doesn't make great use of multiple cores, so it would make more sense to go with raw throughput per core, even if the physical number of cores might be lower from a strictly performance perspective no?  Also, what do you use 20 characters for that necessitates them being concurrent?
---
Re-work the remap system so that instead of remapping *all* attributes in one hit, you get to do it point by point. 
---
Get `+1` new remap point per month, up to the `max` number of points moveable. This should make it less punishing for newbies, who generally need an even spread of attribute points.
---
but I thought capitals were making subcaps obsolete?
---
Getting bubblefucked by those infamous covert ops dictors
---
&gt; dedicated puller toon so you can decline the bad missions without a standings hit)
---
How does this work?
---
Why would the puller being different from the runner change the standings hit situation?
---
hey don't forget to count that 250 afk guys in my 300 toon corp
---
Strawman more please
---
Why? There’s no local in null anymore.
---
Stahp
---
This was a B274 :D
---
Im was one of those guys that enjoyed just relax at my computer mining. I didn't care for PvP, barely ratted. I just wanted to pull into the belt with my orca and five miner, set up and just kind of relax there. It's what I enjoyed. Local let me know if a neut popped in and because I was in a big system, I had plenty of time to warp off. Near2 let me know if somebody was nearby. It's what I enjoyed. That's just me. Its how I enjoyed Eve. Not everybody likes going out and whelping things. I was lucky enough to be part of a corp that as long as I F1'd when it was necessary, they didn't care that all I did was mine. 
---
Now with blackout all the information that was available to me that allowed me to do that is gone. Am I mad? No, not at all because like I previously said I am playing the game differently now and for free. Well mostly. It still is costing me but the money is not going to CCP.  But the point of the matter is that the game is changing. A new type of play is going to emerge like it has previously, except this one is going to have to be more alert and willing to sit at their keyboard instead of falling asleep/afking. It's just how it is now and that's okay
---
Oh, you’re not *in* cloud ring. Gotcha :)
---
Because panic isn't a thing.
---
Because every Ishtar doesn't carry a cyno to light.
---
Because supers don't rat with a cyno.

&gt;jump
---
Jump out of your dang pod before you undock. Life is harsh. (Jump clone fees in NPC stations shouldn't be a thing, though.)
---
Just gazing into the distance universe...
---
Two of my toons had local and Corp chat broken neither of them even showed up in either channel by themselves, the channel was just empty
---
It corrected itself after about an hour with relighting several times
---
Post your main
---
My point stands. Just as, if not more annoying than current attribute system.
---
Live in WH.

What is Jump Fatigue?
---
What is sov?
---
What are Rorqual?
---
Use subcaps to fund your pvp carrier. Atm pve carrier is very low income.
---
Nah we've got Kerry.
---
Not with blackout. It's easy to fool the umbrella with a fake blap, making it much easier to drop caps.
---
Alt + t
---
Make sure you get all the updates beforehand on airport wifi. ;)
---
Good time to make spreadsheets and fittings
---
Nice video. The Kiki tracks drones really well, you can kill them instead of pulling range where you can't apply dps anyways. Nice to see microgang vids.
---
Think you just answered your own question
---
Quickly counted more then 35 patches this year alone..
---
so one every 12 days?
---
Pretty easy to stay updated
---
Good to see Ferox-brains getting shit on.
---
If you already have the fit and the mods but keep secret your super duper important kinks it can only benefit you. But you won't say what it is, because it doesn't exist.
---
Large vedmak spawns are the most dangerous. Their dps is high and their health is undamaged unlike leshak spawns or karybdis spawns.  The order you have to kill them depends on your fit but a passive shield gila probably focus on the harrowing since you need your cap for the invuln and prop. 
---
Starving Leshak can also be a huge issue but if you kill them fast enough with drones you should have enough cap regen to keep invuln on and MWD after not too long.
---
Make sure you have a mwd. Karybdis in my experience aren't that bad just get under their guns and kill anchoring/webbing first which is easy with a gila with rapid lights. Overheat MWD when you need to and don't travel to them in a straight line. 
---
My passive tanked gila at around 800m runs 4s all the time with no issue at all but my skills are maxed and I know how to deal with all the small nuances.  Use aug or navy drones, not just t2. Ammo for gila should always be kin//thm even with the filament hole imo, drones though should match the filament. GL
---
I totally believe you, but it's not really about the money. I'm just looking to try my first capital!
---
Not really minimalist.
---
It's just outlines.
---
You basically drew ALL the outlines.
---
Turn it off and back on again.

This is not in the context of a covert ops drop

He is from Darkness, they will immediately get on knees or bend over to avoid that scenario.

Working as intended. Notice the GUIDED part in the name of the citadel bombs.

The situation will be 2700sp/h and no more thinking about something no one likes.

Nullsec blackout makes carebears look for other things to do, eh?  ;)

...just kidding ...

What specific error messages are you getting.?
---
Hilmar said: "The chaos era has just begun..."
---
Only in Eve can players say "the game is dying" for 16 years straight and still believe it. I mean, jesus man, Mario's probably jealous of us by this point.
---
Carriers aren’t that expensive really. They’re about what a kinda blingy t3c or battleship would cost. Maybe even cheaper, after insurance
---
Kestrel / Hawk / Worm are ok for darks. Hawk is best though
---
i dont think its necessarily super duper important and im sure im not the only one who figured it out.  theres lots of clue pointing to it, in hind sight.  for all i know though, its widely available information
---
what
---
Your English is fine but your lack of punctuation, capitalization and your need to feel important  all point to you being drunk and not knowing shit.
---
Explain to me why you need more structures. 
---
I seriously don't understand why you'd *need* a tether on your personal research Raitaru.
---
What about micro skill point boosters that have increased effectiveness when used to train up a certain subset of skills? It accomplishes the same end of an implant ultimately and can get slapped with a reduced efficiency modifier at total exp milestones like current skill point boosters.
---
no you'll be ok, go to one of the Placid level 5 hubs and krab to your heart's content
---
looking at their killboard, it doesn't seem to change much

hmm well im not drunk, dont feel that important and yea i know my writing is very informal and lazy, sorry. but i do know what im talking about, actually if i really felt the need to be important i would just go ahead and make a big video and walkthrough about it, cus im sure it would be appreciated, as is any conclusion that comes as the result of hard work. so now that we did me, what would you explain your motivations for needing to psychoanalyze people and correct their grammar while trying to make predictions about their behavior would be? over-bearing siblings, or parents maybe? Did you get sent off to military school or something? let it all out im listening friend
---
I mean I had an alt in snigg for almost 2 years - I guess I'm a wormholer now?
---
just wait... an effort post comes on swift wings
---
Welcome.to the Chaos Era. CCP is introducing new features and not bothering to worry about the consequences.
---
That's a good point. Though I feel little will change in my attrociously theory crafted ships, and i'm still going to keep losing them. Though perhaps at a much greater rate!
---
People are just adapting. There are other factors that last july every entity in eve was in a war. This july the only 2 entities at war are WinterCo. and Test
---
That sounds like a more vibrant July to me.
---
How about raising asset safety cost, but at the same time reduce the cost for the recovery of your items over time?
---
It would make abusing the asset safety cost more, but doesn't punish players that had to step away from the game for extended periods.
---
This is not true in lowsec which is what OP is asking about. Blitzing L5s is one of the highest single character ISK/h activities you can do.
---
I'm kind of late, but I have a question. I'm planning to do the same thing as OP, but I'm new to capitals (never used one and never fought one) and I'm not quite sure if it is dread or a carrier that is more appropriate for my usage scenario. Specifically I'm choosing between Naglfar and Nidhoggur.
---
I want to:
---
1. Carry around a bunch of ships and cargo (both can do this)
---
2. Be able to sometimes rat in C5 when I find a lucky wormhole in low or null. Dread is better for this because sleepers couldn't defang it.
---
3. Be able to sometimes throw my capital in PVP for lulz and glory - and that's the real question. Which of them (and why) is more viable for solo or small gang - dread (with HAW refit) or carrier? I'd prefer to use dread if they are nearly on par in this regard, or I can forget about C5 ratting if carrier is a lot better.
---
Well, he didn't specify what metrics he was thinking of. Number of total kills is only a fraction of it.

The first post wasn't that bad actually.
---
This one here is just ridiculous.
---
In a parallel universe, Eve players are spending as much energy enjoying themselves in-game, as the ones in this one spend on trying to outsmart the game's CEO...
---
Going to FW is one of the best things you can do to learn small gang. The southern warzone (minmatar v. amarr) has been more active for a while, especially around amamake, but I hear that the other one is slowly coming back to life, too. FW mechanics are fucked for years already but that doesn’t mean that the concept of FW is dead.
---
What does blue donut mean?

You really see that line as funny?

Some new ideas need tweaking. Your ideas need to be buried at an unmarked location.

Well i love eve as a game but i love more  how people are , sometimes teach you on the hard way and sometimes is kind

i feel sometimes as a broken record  but yeah  i live in cuba and play from  there , well i mean here haha
---
i got so much to thanks to the comunity  as to some  names  on the game , they made me stronger and  go further my limits  
---
i have invite so many and talk to so many about eve but  is a hard task our internet is not  good at least now for it
---
but even in that conditions  from 11 millions of cubans  3 are playing  , and been active   i know is few but it count  , i help them how i can  , one  have  a dream to fly a carrier one day so i help him with omega , and gave him a carrier  , i am not rich   but wanna make his dream come true

i am a krabber that is how i do my isk when he or the  other one is around   they always  looting and salvaging  behind my carrier , this blackout is not helping much but we will find a way

Here's a hint for some actually FUN solo pvp that is properly challenging. Go to PH staging and kill ratters, (R1O-something).
---
Bring something fast and high dps, their response fleet is properly on the ball, usually theyll start landing on you in 20 seconds of you engaging one of their dudes.
---
same problem for me when i tried to pop in real quick on my macbook pro just now... account website doesnt seem to want me to connect either. i gave up- maybe itll work tomorrow?
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
No worries, try to flush DNS cache, clear all accounts of the launcher then read them. Also try to file a bug report so it can be investigated properly.

i have no idea how someone with as thin of a skin as you have survives in eve mate, it's an old meme and you're gay pwnd for falling for it

Who is your isp? Do a pathping and tracer. Post them here
---
I started playing EVE after a decade of following the happenings of the game online, I knew what I was getting into, and that I was going to lose ships to people because they felt like it. I can also appreciate a good fight where both sides gave everything they got and one proved superior. I'll probably be engaging in some of those fights soon enough.
---
That said, one-sided fights where I can't possibly fight back and the other guy initiated for no goddamn reason aren't fun, they're anti-fun. I can understand being ganked for what I might be hauling in a freighter, but having 5-6 ships blow me up and pod me for shits and giggles when I've got nothing worth taking in the first place?
---
I realize it's part of the gameplay and is probably impossible to prevent without ruining what makes EVE unique, but that doesn't make it any less annoying, nor does it stop me from trying to think up ways to fix it.
---
A booster actually sets new players further apart from the old ones. Because Biology V.
---
My take on the LP would be stuff like hiring NPCs for tasks like hauling, mining and citadel defense.
---
Who's your ISP and what country?
---
Just because something is old, doesnt mean its good. And not thim skin. Didnt get offended, just irritates by you spamming that stupid shit
---
I love that you're trying, and there's some interesting stuff here, but Jesus did you TRY to make this thing has work intensive to add to the game as you possibly could?
---
It's a list of entirely new mechanics, from a race that isn't in the game, with ship specific modules, totally unique bonusing, and (mulitiple?) brand new skills.
---
 Like, it really could be interesting if you tweaked some things so it's less useless but it's also a mountain of work for the devs in order to just add one ship to the game. 
---
It's like when you see a concept car design from someone who knows nothing about cars and is just trying to be "different". It's form with no regard for function, use, or difficulty of manufacture.

---
What rock have you being hiding under lol ccp are making the best changes in years right now
---
You'd think if EVE was actually dying, as everyone on r/eve so desperately wants to believe, it would have died by now.
---
You're right, because I lost my ramp I should have tried to kill a few drones as I burned back into range. That might have let me hold grid for longer. Thanks!
---
Eve hardly uses any bandwith and considering the vastness of the game theres not that much data transfer ive played on a 4G connection before and it didnt use that much.
---
aslong as your not joining massive fleets i would say it will be ok
---
&gt; Unplanned breaks are also worth considering, but I would ask how much of what draws us to EVE is the stuff and how much is the people? If my corp were evicted and a corp-mate who had been out unexpectedly returned afterward, you best believe I would be chipping in to help them get back on their feet. I think most of us feel the same
---
  This sort of stuff has happened for years and years- In dominion days you'd lose a region, stations will flip ownership- a year later someone will return to the game, login to find another alliance's flag nailed to the walls. They're trapped inside, their stuff can't be moved out. Either they firesale their shit for a large loss, or hope one day the region is retaken.
---
Close enough.

Now try making an origami celestis and post it here. :D

CCP should add a trig ship that has increased weapon cycle time when it's scarmed/webbed/disrupted.
---
CCP can do whatever it likes with their money. And yes, the moment it leaves your bank account, and flutters down into theirs- It's now their money to do what they like. Crowing "i'm a paying customer" doesn't mean shit either.
---
just summer, relax and go out for a day/two
---
Bet you wanted to kill a carrier with your puny eagle. Don't you know that carrier is a CAPITAL ship that costs whopping 1bil and is supposed to be strong and is perfectly balanced.
---
2 whole years i lasted without a 2nd account. 
---
Man did my life become easier when i got it tho. I was then hooked on the bazzar and now i have more accounts than i know what to do with.
---
Its was a vicious circle
---
I have been looking at the numbers and the pattern of Eve development and CCP decisions for a long time now. So predicting the future of Eve based on the repetitive pattern on it's current trajectory is a fun thing to do. Also Eve players are smarter then most gamers so it is always interesting to hear from them.
---
You do realise that this is all subjective, right? 
---
What you think the 'best' is something different what others think. Neither of you are wrong, but you an idiot if you think someone is.
---
2 - carrier cannot do it, dread can but it'll take like 20 minutes per site so like 1.5b an hour tops. Still nice tho
---
3 - carrier is arguably better, except carriers die to any degree of gang.. as does dreads. Carrier is safer because you can align, but you can be defanged super easily.
---
Send an ingame mail to The Mittani he will hook you up
---
Ishtar, domi, hawk, sabre, praxis mostly.
---
You are right all game changes are subjective, you have to look at the Active Player Count as the only public metric to judge the decisions.
---
This is my main. Bring it!

I've taken a very long break from the game and just started getting back into eve and abyss a couple weeks ago, is there some nuance to using augmented or navy drones that I'm missing? Just looking at Valkyries for running Gammas, the T2 hits the hardest, the RF Valk has better tracking and more hp for less damage and the Augmented is somewhere between both. I don't really have tracking or survivability issues, so what's the use case for the other two over T2?
---
Can't wait to resub to eve once they put out some loli skins for my ships
---
Being "blue" to someone means they're either in the same alliance or have positive standings towards you. Either way, they're considered friendly. And if you look at a map of New Eden, you see that the null sec space encircles the central regions of hi sec and low sec, forming something of a donut.
---
The term "blue donut" refers to large swathes of null sec being allied or friendly with each other.
---
Something like a C2-C3/HS could maybe serve you pretty well. You can roll the C3 for all the PvE content you desire. C3 sites can be done in lots of different ways in relatively cheap ships, so you have plenty of options. 
---
[This list](http://anoik.is/systems?systemclass=c2&amp;staticdest=c3,hs&amp;effect=_unfiltered&amp;shattered=_any_non) shows all of them. Remember the [Rykki WH Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml#), which tells you all about NPC spawns in the different sites.
---
A C2-C2/LS can be an option too, but C3 sites are generally considered a lot better than C2 sites. C2-C2/LS is easier to find, though, since they're abundant and not as popular a hole.
---
You will always run the risk of eviction, but it's really not that common. Pop down an Astrahus, give it the best defense while keeping it cheap and don't put anything super-expensive in the hole (billions worth of Rattlesnakes) and you will be alright.
---
But yes, it's definitely possible for you to do this.
---
Yeah, the best rattlesnake is a machariel.
---
Not my fault you do not understand the name, friend.
---
If you have 2 dread 5 dreads, practice and whatnot, you can 2 cycle a c5 site - so running them in 10 minutes. 6 sites an hour is very solid
---
It's also possible 20 minutes is too short, it might be 25-30 minutes? I haven't solo dreaded before, it looks miserable.
---
I recommend starting in a C2, this gives you one k-space and one j-space static. HS for logistics, C3 for pve. If you are dedicated and have multiple accounts I don't see a reason why this should not work.
---
People generally don't bother evicting powered citadels - put down an astra and raitaru with different timers and you should be fine.
---
I think the best way to do C3 is using a rattlesnake (not expensive, like 800m). I don't know how much isk/hr this is. You would also have to learn how to roll holes.
---
I have been living solo or with another person in wormhole space for years. In my opinion there are few activities that come close in really forming a relationship.
---
Just don't be afraid to fail, get a few rolling megathrons, some scanners and whatever pvp ships you like using (meta is a bit different than k-space but anything will work).
---
Yeah, depends on the hole and what you wanna do with it. 
---
A low static c1? Sure, a little station in there might go years without being noticed and it would suck to evict anyways. Sleeper Sites are "meh" but the pi and industry is good. 
---
A high static c3? Eventual eviction probably. 
---
C4-6 is too tough for 2 new bros on their own.
---
Being old doesnt make it good
---
&gt;That said, one-sided fights where I can't possibly fight back and the other guy initiated for no goddamn reason aren't fun, they're anti-fun. I can understand being ganked for what I might be hauling in a freighter, but having 5-6 ships blow me up and pod me for shits and giggles when I've got nothing worth taking in the first place?
---
I think a lot of that stems from them wanting to pad their killboard. Ever since zkill became a thing, a lot of people used it as a means to measure how "elite" they were. As long as you were isk positive, you won, no matter who you killed. They're not really concerned with loot when it comes to killing shit like a Mackinaw. The simple minded go for easy kills. Smart players go for fun kills.
---
zkill should be used as a means of gathering intel on targets, to see trends, what they fly most, if they like flying cyno ships, if they like doing solo battleship pvp, etc. If your target has a zkill thats full of indy ship kills and he mainly flies a Loki or some other glass cannon gank ship, he's more than likely one of the twats I described earlier. That's all they care about, making the green appear and ruining your fun all while doing *anything* to minimize loss on their end. It's a scummy playstyle. But it's here to stay.
---
Again, this is purely anecdotal and of my own personal feelings on the matter.
---
Also, don't get hung up on your killboard. It has no merits and no recruiter for any big alliance is going to give a fuck how elite you think you are. They only wanna know if you're gonna betray them later.
---
When you will see this game turned into a cash cow pay2win garbage with it's sanbox gameplay ruined, it's payer driven market replaced by npcs and even plex being sold for isk to npcs, then you will know Pearl Abysss has taken over completely, oficcialy or not.
---
So you are a bog standard goon linemember who has sat in on a few blops fleets and suddenly understands all the intricacies involved with mci and how small gang groups play around carriers/supers with cynos. You shoud really stick to your areas of expertise tbh
---
Dang. Well it sounds like you are making the effort to get the kill and I really hope you get your first (but not only) soon!
---
I check this subreddit after CCP changes something to actually understand the impact that change has. Reddit is my knowledgebase of autism
---
Tell me more.
---
By everybody!
---
Look at eve offline, watch the TIS interview, and read the gaming industry news about the purchase of Eve Online. Also do a search of all CCP related news and read about all the layoffs and missteps. If you feel CCP has been doing a great after all that well then we aren't seeing the data the same way.
---
I’m not too familiar with each ones roll but which ship did you find the most success with?

&gt;(i.e not huola).

BRB, running missions in Tama.

It's completely possible, but your biggest problem is going to be isk. Having 1 bil starting capital is very low. Like as in complete newbro low. Also finding an empty/abandoned C2 itself is going to take time.
---
You could also try it out first as PvE hobos without a citadel, live off mobile depots &amp; secure containers. Live in an abandoned C2 for a while and grind the sites.
---
Here's some helpful advice.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/93msoq/by_popular_demand_the_how_to_live_in_a_shattered/
---
You can tell if a citadel in a wh is active by looking at brackets after it's name [x]... the x means number of people docked, 0 means somebody's docked after downtime. You'd be looking for a C2 where there are no brackets in cits and it stays that way for days.
---
And yet look where we are now co pared to even 1 year ago.

I would not recommend living in a shattered to new players and I have done this multiple times to finance my aggressive feeds

Imo that just removes a meaningful choice in a game built from meaningful/hard choices and trade offs.
---
I think this would take too much away.
---
I would like to see a little more lenient remapping option, even if this is only given to new bros (on the line of 3 or 4 free remaps in their first year), with 2 a year for the rest of us.
---
Besides, you have skill injectors for the old bros who want something they aren't mapped for quickly.

You could go with long range webs (Dark Blood) + Railguns with short range ammo. However, I can only say what the other posters say; there's better options for this. The Vindocator isn't exactly the greatest mission ship.

---
I'd like to add that if you plan on farming a C3, then the cheapest option to clear sites is using a Praxis. 200mil fit and you can clear all the normal anoms, once you are setup and comfortable in wh life you can then buy rattles as to also be able to do the data and relic sites.
---
The looming danger of eviction is always gonna be there, but if you are diligent as a group/corp to not let too much assets build up in the hole at one time then an eviction won't cripple you as a group. The people who evict usually go for afk groups, and those that have been observed to be a "loot pinata". So don't be a loot pinata and you will be fine.
---
why would anyone ever upvote this
---
I lived in a wormholes for a while.  If you are starting out probally a c2 or c3 is good.  I normally had an alt in a cloaked orca to dock up ships and store loot.  I then had one other alt and my main run the sites.  C2 sites will be easy with three people but you will get a good idea of what to do.  Eventually you can move into a c3 or just run sites in a good static connection and when you find a nice empty hole you can build a small base of operations.
---
CCP actively developing their game is a good thing
---
they usually take years to make changes that matter
---
Lol thank you
---
Null block ships are free,  you didn't lose anything.  Let the mice have their moment of glory you cockblocker.
---
tbh quite probably.     
---
I was looking on the big ship kills and excluding dreads people throwing at each other you see a significant drop of stuff dying.          
---
From my perspective where i look for big stuff in higsec ... you see similar reduction .
---
A vindi is possible. Don't worry about shooting the small stuff. You can just put a web on it and kill it with drones.  Use the Jump Drive to get away from the Majority of the DPS. If you want Bling I also have a shield fit that works too.

You should be able to for sure.

The skill threshold required for c2 is SUPER low.
---
The hardest part would just be handling wormhole logistics and scanning.
---
Good for you.
---
If it was just NullSec numbers the adapting theory would be a possibility , but the numbers cover all of High, Low, and Null.
---
Steps??
---
I hope never.
---
The Front Line Drifter Battleship is the hardest hitter in the t4's.  Nuets can be an issue when you get 3 Starving Vendmaks and 5 Starving Damaviks pls other adds. It is also possible to get a spawn of 5-10 Nueting Scyllas. You should really only move up to the next level if you are clearing the current level with 5-10 minutes extra time. The three Sleeper battleships will definitely make you push it on time if you aren't careful. Also, if you notice any rubber banding from the server while you are running these, stop for the day. It is likely you will disconnect.
---
Die crybaby hunter die.
---
doesn't look like it will be ending any time soon, CCP's balls grew massively over night so it is time to adapt and prepare for some more drastic changes
---
Fantastic, what are you going to do with all of that ISK!
---
They relate to it - that is, washing themselves with a rag on a stick.
---
Apply the blackout to Jita,  local there is fucking cancer.
---
You brag about playing since 2003 but have not yet mastered the skills to go about your business without local, I know players that have played under a year that are more capable than you are.
---
Amen brother.
---
Y that was me in the BL titan video :)
---
Ingame chat channel : Abyssal Lurkers 
---
It has diff fits for diff sites, worth looking into.
---
They have to care about the Skill farmers too. Also investors care about the numbers,  but nothing else.
---
You a good man for helping me out!
---
I stress out blasters or artillery or autoguns cause I am burnt out of using missiles or rails.... used them since I started and I want a bit of new flavour to the game. Both shipwise and weapon wise.
---
Hyperion fit, with blasters, possible?
---
Also a machariel with artillery/auto's possible?
---
Would love some solo lvl4's face roll fittings for the two.
---
Give me about 5 minutes and I'll edit the comment with some fits for you to use along those lines.
---
First thing make sure you are in the right alliance  so you do not die the moment you unteather the thing. Make sure you are following thier skill plan, so when the get dropped on you can get saved.
---
You are going to get hunted in this ship no mater what alliance  you are in. Doing L5s is 100% possible good chance you alliance has a group for it.
---
Check with your alliance on which to go for, no point going with a chimera if they have no shield fax to save you. Pvp currently favours thannatos, and the super that is most popular is the nyx.
---
Aw damn, too bad all those bots don't log in anymore......
---
recruiting btw.
---
Woah, great job sir. Originally I was thinking of it as some kind of exploit making it impossible to locate a ship, however then I read the message of /u/Raethrius and learned that people in Eve might be way more inquisitive than me. And now you did it! I'm looking forward to hearing how it was done
---
Sure fam. It’s not about capability, it’s more about the ideal behind nullsec and the fact CCP shouldn’t be intervening like this.
---
Yeah, but the cancer of it still kills me. Use lore to fuck posting in local as well. 
---
To be fair, I just drag it out and minimise it ... but it gives me the shits knowing it’s there giving me cancer or std’s via proximity.
---
I crab just like most people in Eve, I also pvp and own supers, I dabble in manufacturing and various other aspects too, whats the problem?
---
It would be a mistake to go back on it now. Everyone got a taste for it and it would suck to back off and make null-sec safer. Keep it. Players adapt anyway.
---
Then they will destroy the game. Eve is a difficult enough game to play as it is with everyone vying to blow your shit up. There are far better options to improve the game than adding chaos (and thus even more unfairness) to the game, like fixing cyno mechanics, fixing sov mechanics, capital proliferation etc etc
---
N-6 is a great place. Aleks and friends that make up CANS are good men.
---
Launcher, probes and we'll usually throw in a novelty item too. #freehugs
---
The only things that bother me is the wasted bandwith and disc space
---
Eve players are some of the dumbest pondlife iv ever met
---
I want the entire paint shop from Forza to make custom ship skins for exactly this reason.
---
This is true :) and thanks man
---
It’s much safer for cloaked and kitey ducks, so... it is safer.
---
If you were an elite PvP player your isk making would be in highsec safe from the effects of black out and being hunted like the prey you are
---
&gt;Then they will destroy the game.
---
They wont destroy the game, just your game it seems.
---
If only there were some areas of space specifically made to be safer than NULLsec.. maybe they could call them LOWsec and HIGHsec?
---
Just leave already
---
I didn't listen to the video yet, am at work. But what seems more odd to me is the misconception that this whaling event was part of any war.
---
Hmmm.
---
I don't care about those graphs I don't even care if the drop is love players and not the bits because the people that are left are the only ones worth playing eve with, crabs disgust me
---
I care
---
yea, but i figured someone else might have more use for some extra omega.
---
What are incursions like for you in warp to me with only 
---
1 spawn and armour leshak contest fleets
---
CCP seem to slowly revert some changes they made in regards to PvE in the last years.
---
Maybe the blackout will end once they are happy with the economy and moved their pieces into position.
---
But for now indefinite means indefinite.
---
Stop being dumb.  The problem is as the OP said we managed to have fights quite easily without blackout. The fact is you've become fat and lazy.  This is the players doing nothing else.  Nothing has ever ever stopped anyone pvping.  Nothing but the players..
---
cap insurance  got nerfed tho
---
They can (and should) still do all those things. And without local maybe something like an anchorable anti-cloak bubble would be justified to encourage people to fly normal gangs more often. 
---
The end goal should be creating a meta where playing optimally leads to less ganks and more actual fights. Right now that's not the case for all kinds of reasons, like cynos and supercap umbrellas and blops bomber gangs being so effective.
---
Isnt that when you drop the second set of 20 titans?
---
Fly a dread instead.  Carriers just got nerfed hard and the Chimera is almost never used due to the lack of damage bonus.  The Phoenix, on the other hand, can be pretty useful.
---
Its fairly obvious they have decided that the game needs massive life style changes.   The fact they are doing it and pretty much proudly announcing that they are means they slao accept that there will be loss of subs.   They have accepted this loss and are doing it anyways.
---
I am not a wardecer but a pirate.      
---
People are hauling much less ... of everything.     
---
Normally you could see people moving in/out structures, hulls, various materials or mix of all above.      
---
Now .... like every thing is dead, like people stopped playing or investing in area they are live in.            
---
The only thing you see atm is a lot of people moving mining barges, t1 and T2 versions.         
---
Not huge values but noticeably more.          
---
You see also increase of people moving out roaming ships **but only triglavian** still those are usually worthless targets as it is below 1bil , quite often below 500mil.             
---
From a perspective of guy that keeps eyes on the trade hubs from the 'piracy' perspective  .... like all the things have died.
---
Yes there was 2,395,000,000,000 more ISK destroyed in 2018.  Alot of the regions where 2019 had more kills, 2018 had more ISK destroyed.  Theres alot to conjecture, but one I would like to know is structure consolidation among powers.  Big powers taking out small powers structures to control markets.
---
Ahh, neat. Thanks for the info :)
---
Maybe one day they'll make T2 FoF missiles
---
WTM usually lose contests because of that yeah
---
Tbh CCP should consider giving us a devblog **that blackout stays** as it was meant to be only till the EOM based on initial statement.  
---
/u/ccp_falcon consider giving some update - as many people don't know that fact that blackout stays and are waiting till the EOM.        
---
Thx.
---
Reminds me when black legion decided that Faspera would be an appropriate midpoint for their super fleet...
---
Make the game better for who? For big groups that can then earn dank isk by killing structures of small nullsec groups unable to fight such a large group? If you want no asset safety there's wormholes for that. I can guarantee that without asset safety in null, it will become much less populated.
---
Hopefully never.
---
hmm, you work at CCP perhaps?
---
Why not both?
---
Limited anoms and no local.
---
The idea behind nullsec is that the empires don't have any control there.
---
So why should the empires bankroll your local?
---
Yes, but there wasn't a drastic difference between Trade Hubs except 1 or 2.  Forge less than 1000 kill difference, Sinq Laison less than 900 difference. Metropolis had about 1000 kill difference. Domain had had 3400ish in 2018s favor,  Heimatar had 4,500ish difference in 2019s favor.
---
I didn't know your mom was in the fleet aswell
---
&gt; New players finding out they aren't optimized is super discouraging
---
It's a mystery to me why people consider this "complexity" a bad idea.  Or do you mean to suggest today's gamers are complete snowflakes with very low IQs?
---
When I started Eve (in 2003), we had skills for attributes.  It didn't "discourage" me at all.  It was just part of the game.
---
The more Eve tries to become an arcade, the less appealing it will be.  There are other, better games out there for that.
---
We said in the initial communication that we wouldn't be giving a duration for the blackout. 
---
We'll end it when we've collected enough data, until then it'll remain in place.
---
It's my fond hope that it becomes permanent, and that we eventually extend changes to local into lowsec too, in some shape or form.
---
&gt; Any time you undock you consent to PvP.
---
So, if you don't want to lose them don't undock with them in?
---
If eve is too hard, go back to highsec.
---
I don't man, that seems a bit crazy.
---
I was getting the pings to login supers when I was outta country having forgotten to buy my hel before I left :(
---
think about living in a shattered hole with a depo, practice scanning the sigs and running the sites/relics. it will give you a taste of all the scanning you have to do and not risk much isk (does not take much investment either)
---
RvB is in Caldari FW now, so you can do both.
---
Thanks, happy I can entertain!
---
m8, D-scan that doesnt update automatically is a real problem. My Left indexfinger is about to give up. 
---
Local for Fleetmembers should also be a thing, it's incredibly hard keeping a fleet together. It also doesn't help when trying to warp to someone in fleet quickly. If you want to warp to someone in fleet you have to search him in a long list of either Fleetchat or Fleetwindow.
---
Both of them are?
---
No joke, that is actually how I thought the cynos worked when I first started using them, based on their description. It made total sense to me back then (and now as well) that if a cyno is how a jump drive locks the location, then it would be visible on all jump drive ships and able to jumped to.
---
The "this is a cyno for me" psycology should only be available in covert cynos.
---
Yeah i bet the Chinese majority in frat cares deeply what some random schmock on reddit has to say...
---
Ooooor, it's just your bad posting.
---
Not aligned with winter or panfam btw.
---
start by doing day trips. in to WHs. and get the hang of it. 
---
get used to scanning. eventually you can scan on autopilot.   
---
and press d scan like its second nature for you. 
---
during your  day trips. 
---
\- scan deeper in to chains.   
---
\- scan high class WH chains for those dank gas sites.   
---
\- learn rolling. with Battleships. and cruisers, how WH mass works.   
---
\- and comms. expect pvp. at all times. you never know who is watching.   
---
\- use a Wh mapping too. eg. siggy. Pathfinder.   
---
\- learn ( make ) a bookmarking convention. ( saves a fuck ton of head aches  )  
---
\- learn what WH effects are and how to use them to your advantage   
---
\- learn how polarization works. ( lot of people get caught on this simple principle  
---
\- as lot of people say here c3 sites are pretty lucrative to run solo.   
---
\- stay away from c4 sites, they are cancer. and waste of time  
---
\- Learn how and what hole controll is. and make friends. a lot of friends.   
---
\- ask other wormholes on whats and nots. 90% of them will teach you a ton of stuff.  
---
\- now during this period if you find a nice and quite hole make a scanner alt and log it off here.   
---
\- and then get everyting together. a small stick a 3 - 4x battleship + a couple of  rolling cruisers . some pvp ships and drop your astra.   
---
now you are home. defend it nurish it. and go kill eachother.
---
&gt;Tbh CCP should consider giving us a devblog **that blackout stays** as it was meant to be only till the EOM based on initial statement.
---
Nope, they said they wouldn't give a duration.
---
Of my four characters two of them had issues loading up local and corp chat. Other, player made, chats worked just fine oddly enough. 
---
Took me a couple of relogs to get the chats to work properly.
---
Ok what was is making people confused :           
---
The initial article was named:      
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pu69gy/nullsec-local-blackout-incoming-during-july                   
---
&gt;Nullsec Local Blackout Incoming **During July**!            
---
English is not my primary language - obviously - but you can say the same for many eve players.               
---
I just checked and i understand this eg like this :               
---
https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=during+meaning                 
---
&gt;during       
---
preposition: during          
---
&gt;    throughout the course or duration of (a period of time).              
---
So more or less the title of your article is saying.         
---
&gt;Nullsec Local Blackout Incoming ~~During~~ for the duration of July!       
---
I am not the only person that read it/understand it this way.      
---
But as i spend a way to much time on reading/podcasts i know that it is not going away - but i constantly hear from people "we need to wait till the end of the month".              
---
Additional information clearing this up for non EN speaking people in  launcher will not hurt any one.
---
That's fair enough suggestion..I just didnt want people to think blackout was the whole answer to the  solution.
---
[deleted]
---
Yes
---
Guy with camera is a ELITE PRO PVP :D
---
exactly :D
---
Scroll bit down and you will understand why i think we need this information in launcher.      
---
I posted bit more details in the CCP Falcon post.        
---
Not all people playing EVE are EN speakers and the initial article had a bit misleading title.        
---
This is why we have people coming to reddit and asking "when it ends"
---
Person can xup or you can add this person to "observed"
---
I guess, I simply need to raise my standing with the Caldari state, to be able to do it? (both my characters being Gallente)
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78147193/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78147193/)  tanky :)
---
Next time just do the bloody dishes lol
---
You can apply to Red or Blue, the Corp standings is what matters.
---
I tank you very much for these. Heres a silver.
---
Are you saying Test and Imperium arent strategic allies anymore but just happen to be on grid sometimes for the same timers? If so, what happened that stopped Imperial Legacy being a thing?
---
Well more kills, but less ISK destroyed compared to 2018.
---
The empires bankrolls it with our trade taxes. By your own reasoning Remove local=remove npc tax.
---
Funny thing is I did not say anything about changing/removing Black Out, but it does seem CCP was blowing smoke about activity and if its down due to Black Out.  Perhaps there is a better way to "fix" NullSec.
---
Bring 30 carriers, beat 200 dudes. Seems balanced
---
your an idiot, and once all those crabs are gone your either going to become one because youll need to, no one else is gona mine, refine, and build your ships for you, or your gona need to dip into your wallet for an ever decreasing payout as fewer players are in the game and plex prices drop so youll still probably end up being a crab..
---
Welcome to the crab club, hope you enjoy the 5 minute stay before you rage quit and win eve.
---
theres not really many people asking about this.
---
I've been having more fun than ever
---
Never said it was balanced, but thats the claim nullseccers make when we can't kill them after they drop 30 and we got 40-50 ppl :D
---
No, one small change that affects maybe 1/4 of all EVE players does not make up for fucking the game in the eye for the last five years.
---
Unless you're a blind, retarded fanboy.
---
Are you?
---
yeah you'r the guy with camera
---
I'm sure only real players stopped playing how goes your psyop?
---
MWD when?
---
Can this test be like Star Citizen beta please ?
---
No pedos pls
---
exactly  \^\^
---
Haha yeh need to get back to that man :)
---
&gt; You do realise that this is all subjective, right? 
---
Funny how it's "subjective" when you don't agree with it or "so true" when you do.
---
To be honest, if that picture's supposed to be an accurate reflection of how you feel, you should consider walking away from gaming full-stop.    
---
Maybe buy a train set.
---
Have patience, they are just fixing chat. But don't want to say that out loud like last time in case they fail again.
---
Go rails, it's definitely possible, but it'll be extremely inefficient. Back when it was possible, I was doing L4s with my alpha account in a rail gnosis. I have a feeling it'll be like that.
---
&gt;I for one am looking forward for the game to be taken over by a fresh perspective and new developers not tied to CCP corporate culture.
---
Pearl Abyss isn't any better than CCP.
---
I’m the guy with camera to, I’m in Corp/Alliance “elite pvp” and we got so much fun with all this
---
I do not know which "this" weeb thing you mean, but generally it is a term describing someone clearly non-Japanese really wishing to be Japanese. I think it is still a thing in some cases when people wish to be something they are not due to perceived attractiveness of something exotic and at the same time fashionable. As in nothing to do with anime or manga or chibi or comics or samurai. 
---
Why internet ignorance is still a thing I also do not know, as all the information is literally at one's fingertips. 
---
To answer your questions we need a much clearer defined question. Like "what are you even talking about?" defined.
---
I'm hoping the answer is, buy insurance and pay for srp.
---
don't ruin the narrative.
---
Nice, I look forward to all the chaos I'm gonna be rolling around in it like fox poo.
---
Are vanguard or scout sites worth doing at all?
---
I did incursions a while ago (the hq or assault sites I think) and was getting roughly 100m isk an hour. Is it possible to run the smaller sites with a group of 2 or 3? I did try trig invasions but as the isk pay out is split between all on grid rather than by fleet you lose a lot of isk to people doing ninja stuff
---
A good yonis post WHERE IS THE REAL YONIS
---
It's a really  bad drug it pays worse then sweatshop labor.
---
who's more logically inclined to stop playing/stop paying for a sub..
---
a) a botter with very little to lose, required minor changes to adapt to dscan req and eyes on gates, and makes a little less but still basically free isk.
---
b) a pvp player with 10 accounts, 2 he actively pvp's with and 8 he mostly afk mines or afk rats with.
---
"Delayed local"
---
Taxes based on security status is actually sounds interesting! Rancer Trade Hub takes over!
---
fake
---
You are new on the game right? Smart Bombs are enabled on Low Sec.
---
Sorry for intruding but how does one find his WH again if it collapses while he is out from it?
---
It's not hard to keep a fleet together. This is a communication issue in your group it's not a issue with the game.
---
Oh ma gawd Eve Is DiEiNG!
---
Because CCP created those huge info fields on the launcher to communicate stuff to players?
---
If your still here you didn't quit like the rest of the attention seekers.
---
Yay I win in this one for a change \o/ even though ngl I was spamming warp near the end in the Hookbill XD
---
Will continue till enough people unsub.
---
chimera is good for roleplay.
---
It said when it would be coming, not when it would be leaving. Sure hope it's permanent, in one way or another.
---
It isn't going anywhere. 
---
There are places with local, why not play in lowsec or highsec?
---
Was soooo hard for them. Seeing mom and dad fighting each other. :(
---
Dealing 300dps in engage looks good.. In this situation against the machariel i did ~8 cycle with mystic loaded then 10 with meson and at least 12 with mystic again. So the max dps inc was 400 then 400 and arround 500. If i didn't pulled that range with 20cycle in mystic i double my dps and at 22-23cycle he could be dead instead of 30
---
I also like the way i can tank while staking up
---
Btw bought it when he was at 650/700m buy order :P
---
Literally every PvP game. Human nature is the issue here.
---
Fly a tristan. If you enjoy the tristan pretend its a carrier. Move at 100ms, wait 16 before you hit warp, fit drone navigation amps  etc.
---
Here's the best guide that I know of for people wanting to start living in a wormhole:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8yye3r/wormhole_eviction_survival_guide_for_beginners/
---
Basically, the first part of the guide is how to keep a low profile so that you don't get evicted. Always keep your structures powered and stay a small corp and you will basically never get evicted, unless you piss off a more powerful corp.
---
Dunno about your  stats,im killing more and die more
---
Ye i'm pretty sorry if you can't understand the whole situation.
---
Sometimes i record just for the fun, sometimes just to see what happens if things goes wrong...
---
But ye if i think a fight might be cool i'll zoom out a bit more.
---
In my head it's completly clear, i know where people are, i have their speed, with the look at their position and i'm used to fly like this since years so ye i understand it's kinda difficult when you are not used to ^^
---
Thank's for your msg
---
So your implying most botters have the hardware to have a bot on every gate of every system their bot is in? That scale would certainly kill how many you could run.
---
The pvper shouldn't have any issue making isk. If null isn't working for him he can move on to so much better opportunities. He could also put in the slightest effort so it's not a issue like krab in a dead in pocket and put a scout on the gate have it on his other monitor or use evo and see when a red pops in from the smol box.
---
It's not a issue I used to afk farm c5 sites with a evo preview box to see new sigs pop could do the same with a gate I couldn't even see my games screen just youtube and where sigs popup.
---
Logistical nightmare, near impossible. A pilot needs to have at least 1 (preferably multiple) probing alts within the system who's responsibility it is to *never* leave the hole. Ever. They are your keys to the front door, so to speak.
---
I honestly don’t know if I could ever play Eve again if you bring back local to Null sec. I quit for 4 months recently due to getting sick of seeing so many BOTS in Null sec space when solo roaming trying to find targets I might actually have a chance to kill. Then you deleted local and all these pesky botters virtually disappeared from Null sec overnight! Best change ever made in Eve, to roll it back to appease lazy krabbers and not aspirants would finally kill the game, for me at least.
---
IIRC, the incursions are supposed to be done in groups of 10, 20 and 40. It might be possible to do the 10 man incursions sites in a group of 5-7 people with blingy ships, you'll have to look at how much dps and neuts you have to survive to know exactly what kind of logi + dps to bring
---
But this sub tells me they're still OP, and must be nerfed to the ground. Along with anything that isn't a t3c or stealth bomber.
---
No I wouldn't be surprised if 50% of the "players" were bots at this point. It wouldn't surprise me either if CCP used bots to boost the player count.
---
Who were you running with?
---
I think you're trying to say make it easier for smaller groups to get started. And I agree, it's silly that in order to be competitive in eve you need web servers and Devs to integrate and run services based on CCPs API. Especially now that Peligro wants to hit groups that have members who bot, you need to be on top of it or risk getting your alliance punished.
---
I definitely don't want to pay for all that.
---
Not this meme again. 
---
Be original
---
I always imagined it as an alliance having every neighboring alliance blue to them. So all their immediate allies form a circle around them - a blue donut.
---
Ships will get spendy and mining will get profitable. People who don't really want to play can AFK in hisec, people who do want to play (and not just afk 10 accounts) can make more ISK doing dangerous jobs. Seems good to me.
---
Here's the fun part, everyone can be the guy with the camera!
---
I am all GRRRR big coalitio, but I can see your point about ingame functions that make organisation for groups of all scales easier.

---
Changes idea are great even for krab like me, but implementation suck hard...
---
They could make it more interesting for both sides, now it will take years to solve free intel problem.
---
You replied to the wrong comment brodie
---
For ppl who dont like being dirty while being glittery at the same time MCAV IS RECRUITING
---
&gt;And if you wanted to get high rep with everyone how would you do that when most missions seem to ask you to kill a different faction?
---
You can get high standings with everyone through Epic Arcs. For missioning it's more effective to not care about all standings though. But, if your standings drop too low you will be attacked if you enter highsec own by that faction. So consider that.
---
You  should always have a scanning alt logged off in your hole in  case t happens. Other than that you might consider contacting  Signal Cartel  and asking for their  help.
---
I shall save your comment
---
The safety of L5 carriers isn't even that people don't see them. 
---
As long as you religiously watch dscan you can never get caught. Even in the worst-case scenario when the hunter waits for you to initiate warp to a new site before launching probes you can just jump to your out-cyno out of warp-invuln.
---
The bad thing about gating isn't visiblity (in my opinion at least), but that there is a much larger room for mistakes jumping to a cyno from gate-cloak if you ever have to.
---
Good luck with it dude
---
I'll just add to this:
---
You don't have to search for your new home yourself, there are ingame channels in which people will sell a wormhole to you, oftentimes also with the customs offices. This is actually reliable service, I bought like this several times and never was screwed over.
---
Being able to cover all celestials with a dscan from your tether is convenient and will also improve your security.
---
Never run sites with expensive ships. If you are grouped, your hulls shouldn't cost more than 150mil each.
---
Bookmark sites after you complete them, then warp around with cheap tech 1 destroyer and salvage all the wrecks. You gotta have at least Salvaging 4 and salvaging rigs fitted in order for it to be fast and not a hassle.
---
In any case, yes go do it. No one is gonna evict you unless someone pays them to do so.
---
Joke's on you - Reddit's been vibrant as fuck this summer.
---
all my posts are highquality, Tau has to approve every single thing I post on reddit
---
You can be scanned down from outside dscan range if the hunter has max scanning skills + virtues
---
The Chimera would be trash at L5s and just about everything else as well for that matter. It's not a good ship
---
The big 14. No point in t2 heavies
---
We're still very much active. Fleets every day around 20-21 Eve time. Plexing can be lucrative in the form of LP. If you're looking for some non-serious internet spaceship business and pew pew, you'll fit right in.
---
Our in game chat is R-V-B.
---
Yes but in a decent size and power corporation.
---
It's a lot more isk and less risk than null sec as long as you don't keep too much of your stuff inside the wh.
---
Logistics are somewhatbof a problem if you don't have multiple characters but that can be overcome too.
---
Due to game mechanics Red vs Blue is in Caldari FW.
---
Due to mutual war mechanics we can still be at war with each other under the same FW alliance.
---
We get a lot of new bros looking for pvp experience daily now and we will help you out the best we can.
---
Currently we are trying to grow numbers again so we can bring back all aspects of RvB but it will take time.
---
All we expect from new and old vets joining is to undock and have fun. We expect new bro to learn by flying. Veterans joining we just ask you to pass on knowledge where and when you can, 
---
Also to try bring back the shakes in you old grumpy gits!
---
That's what an active user is though. Welcome to the era where unique logins matter more than people in space because CCP wants that buyout bonus.
---
More cool things to buy in an LP store will sink both of them. Adding LP to the market will sink more LP through taxes. You can even add a fee of 100 isk for each LP converted from your journal to the tradable item. That way for every 1 mil LP moved to a tradable item takes 100 mil isk out of the economy. Lots of clever things you can do if you are creative enough.
---
Yeah, I guess Coalitions and treaties mean nothing to them.
---
You haven't played the game for 9years, you probably don't have much isk (especially after funding the skill injectors). I don't see you flying that carrier for a long time, or replacing it easily.   
---
If you truly want to do capital stuff solo, good luck. Otherwise I would recommend a newbie friendly organization that can teach you capital stuff, fittings etc and save your ass, if you get tackled. Obvious choice would be Karmafleet or Pandemic Horde, if you don't mind being in null sec.
---
[Magic 14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14) but yeah I agree. Magic 14 helps you in all ships so they are good to get up. Aside from that I'd figure out what you want from a clone and focus it. For my current main I wanted only pvp so I mastered frigates, then cruisers, then battleships. Now I'm just training every sub cap skill to max before I start on capital skills.
---
How come on some of my characters, I don't see the capacitor/HUD element at the bottom? Reset cache and re logging doesn't work. Wasn't able to do the SP challenge on some characters tonight because of it.
---
It doesn't matter if neutrals invited you, your sworn allies invited you. Seriously, fuck Snuff. No idea why you would protect them.
---
You forgot to mention google sheets!
---
Why did you taint the data by having Blackout alongside login rewards?
---
That's just the shitty chat system being shitty. The blackout is to see if they can remove their broken chat system and how we will react to it.
---
Make EVE great again!
---
Back to an era before SJW, handholding and carebear buffing.
---
Could look into what PI you can do with the planets in your wormhole. It doesn't need a lot of training, it's a huge pain in the ass to set up once and after that it's maybe half an hour of work every few days to keep it running. Wormholes tend to have a pretty good distribution of PI materials. In our old one I could make Organic Mortar Applicators from the ground up with 2 accounts, or you can just create and sell P2s or P3s.
---
its still probably better than getting 30 mil for your blown up 1bil tengu
---
One small bit of advice if you're *not* looking for Content or being disturbed while you do small industrial or economic things: C3/LS systems are some of the least active, populated, or contested regions of JSpace. So if you just want to do some things and not be disturbed constantly, C3/LS might be a good system type to land in.
---
As for actually living in a wormhole: Biggest single piece of logistical advice: Create two Alpha accounts. Put them in scanning ships. (I use the Sunesis because it gets the probe bonus, it can easily get 2s align, and it can have 4 scanning mids.) Dock those two characters in whatever structure you call home (or maybe even safelog one of them in the middle of nowhere in the system). Those are your emergency backup characters. Their job is to stay logged out, unless one or more of your members are either killed or inadvertently rolled out. The first backup's job is to scan a way for your mains to get back in. Otherwise, it never leaves the system. The second backup's job is to scan a way in for your first backup if you *really* screw up and lose them too. Otherwise it never even logs in at all.
---
a "while" ago
---
Not having enough isk to have extra ships to PvP in as a new bro because they spent a ton of isk on accelerating their SP gain through a booster will prevent a ton of PvP. Let them keep their hard warmed isk to do what they want to do in Eve, instead of keeping them trying catch up with isk.
---
What is so hard about being creative and coming up with new high margin items that FW can purchase through the LP store? I don't know how you could possibly confuse that with wanting to make LP worthless and fucking over FW. Implants are a way to sink LP. Be creative and find other items worth being the sink.
---
Other than free intel, they prevent more fights than anything else. They are a massive issue. 
---
Why should the largest ships also be the fastest? How do you counter instant teleport?
---
&gt;It would make everyone into Rorq miners cause when the big gangs come for you they will kill even supers before you can react.
---
Its a choice if you want to defend.
---
&gt;Stop thinking you can balance big gang with small gang, you cant.
---
Stop thinking you can sit in a station many jumps out and protect stuff.
---
cool story bro but you dont need to lock a pod up when u smartbomb it
---
Killing pods is dumb there is no reward just fake internet points. We should get isk for killing pods
---
Maybe because we're here long enough to remember that local has been here for 16 years and in that time a fuckillion ships have been destroyed in null.
---
I smartbombed my alts ascendancy clone once, tackled a nyx light cyno he kills hic a few secs before he pops and it didn't cross my mind to warp it off so I went to smartbomb him and missed but killed myself gg
---
or maybe, just maybe, people are making shit up to sound more credible when they whine for stuff, as if playing a game for 16 years makes their opinions more valid than anyone else.
---
A group of players can function on the combat sites for some decent ISK. A newer solo player can manage many of the relic and data sites for decent ISK. However, I would recommend a LOT of research into who you join/recruit because a higher SP solo player can empty a hole in a short time, and your survival odds against aggressors is rather low.  
---
It's -possible- but the problem you encounter with newer folks is many quit or have life intervene, and they won't be around when you need them. The fewer people, the more time spent rolling holes, and a bunch of new characters who can't scan well, let alone fit everything to roll the hole with a few battleships that they are okay with losing (assuming you get rolled out, or worse, into a hostile system) are more than likely going to be irritated with most of the their time wasted -trying- to be productive rather than productive.
---
If you re just starting again, I wouldn t try to setup in a wormhole. There is so much to learn in this game and a WH is a pretty big time commitment and time sink. I would recommend you and your friends join a lowsec or null corp and learn the ropes first. you can always dive into wormholes to gain more experience with it. If you guys want to do your own thing there is alot of low populated faction null. you can use the npc stations there, try to make friends with the locals (but never completely trust em), do the sites, mine etc. If things get rough you re not as commited as in a wh where you rely on your own structures and store so many ressources there.
---
Can you share the channels?
---
What, you don't believe people have actually been around for that long in this game? They have mate, I started in 2005. And the point still stands, local never stopped PVP from happening. If ppl want "old" PVP back, they'd have to look at other changes that have happened.
---
It for sure makes them losers
---
sure people started back then. but any time theres a bitch and moan thread, its always the same story. "I started back in 2003 im unsubscribing my 50 accounts" and so on.
---
Last july, every group was at war with each other...
---
typical autz things
---
good job dato ;p
---
Ok. Bombs orbit archor to 10km, be ready and keep eyes on broadcast
---
You dont actually need to but it’s useful for the timing. If the person is spamming warp and you don’t have it locked up, by the time the ship disappears on the overview/the pod appears, it may already be too late.
---
The salt you get is worth it though.
---
Hahaha that’s a great story, pretty much exactly what happened with me. Although to be fair a Nyx pod is likely worth more.
---
I know! If these were HGs I don’t think I would have laughed it off so easily.
---
Thats the point!  Due to the interference by CCP with the Drifter BS hitting all the major groups in NullSec causing NullSec groups to blue up more because they do not know what CCP will do next now theyre too skittish to fight each other like they would.  Goons left the north early cause of CCP PvE interference in the PvP meta without warning.
---
There
---
You'll need five people to run scouts iirc, the payout is reduced of you run it with less.
---
Your data collection is already flawed, with the fact you've introduced so many programs in order to get people to login/kill NPCs and so on, during the blackout. How can that be a good data sample? It's ridiculous, on top of the fact your boss stated that its clear from people swapping to a 64bit client, means they are not risk adverse, what kind of logic is it your are using in your office? 
---
Let me make this plain and simple for you, outside of the echo-chamber that is reddit, which you seem to use as your brain-storming saloon, the blackout is a massive flop. It does not fix the massive issues facing Eve. It does not fix the cyno-mechanics, it does not fix the capital proliferation, it does not fix the terrible sov system in place. Adding more chaos to these already terrible mechanics is not going to fix anything. The game is already one of the hardest MMOs to get into online, adding chaos, making it even more punishing is going to push people away from the game. This is not the way to fix things. Creating incentives to fight, reasons for big player-empires to attack one another, less restrictive and time consuming sov-mechanics, flash points, catalysts for wars. These are things that bring players, as exemplified by multiple data-sources of massive wars in eve. 
---
You are killing your own game, even if the people who want easy kills on reddit are laying down at your feat, praising your every move, the data simply shows that blackout is killing nullsec, which is meant to be a player-generated area of the game, untouched by CCP, outside of structural changes to mechanics. The trajectory of online players is going down. Making the game harder wont change that.
---
&gt; and recent missteps
---
what?
---
Was the release date announced somewhere that I missed? [The dev blog](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pvewgz/updates-to-sales-taxes-and-brokers-fees) just says "soon", and it's also not in the official patch notes yet.
---
Thanks!
---
Again Reddit faster than dev blog!
---
Mid grade pod for mid grade pilot
---
Chaos
---
I am sure you will say that when the login numbers are down to 4 digits at prime-time.
---
Yeah, def. "EVE is dying" has been the one and only acceptable position to take on r/eve since 2007, with any other positions or arguments being downvoted like nobody's business.
---
Where did I say eve was too hard? My point is, eve wants new players, making the game harder for them will not make them stay. Blackout makes the game harder, actually fixing the real issues makes the game more enjoyable, more fights, more massive wars, better sov mechanics, better cyno mechanics and so on and so forth. This is called nuance.
---
Ah, the type of people /u/CCP_Falcon should listen to in order to keep the game running. Bravo.
---
It s totally doable, i d look to find someone with experience to join your project but you could also learn on the fly if you dont mind taking a couple surprise beatings.
---
was funny cause i just see Dati show up in Huola, and then i hear “ oh noo”
---
All this will do is make the smaller alliances merge into the larger and create even more umbrella alliances. The blackout fixes NOTHING.
---
Remember the ranting about getting people to leave hi-sec coz it  was to safe, l4's were an isk fawcet,null was empty, low lacked content? That was a decade ago. (Pepperidge farm reference here)
---
RIP Eve then I guess.
---
yea train the magic 14  first as they are very importante
---
Guilty as charged.
---
Maybe its because we remember nullsec where fights were plentiful and massive wars happened more than once a year.
---
"Empire building in highsec" doesnt have the same ring to it.
---
Hahahahhaha fkin dato, that made me laugh loud in the bus. Wp :)
---
Traders ADAPT or DIE! Thanks CCP :D
---
It would be interesting to see what the months prior to blackout were like in comparison to the previous years.
---
I have a feeling this year in general will be quite down on previous years
---
You can actually run 2 cans.
---
Can-explosions do ignore resists I belive, so as long as you don't get the 10k buffer (Damage in wh ghost sites) you will most likely die.
---
&gt;\- ask other wormholes on whats and nots. 90% of them will teach you a ton of stuff.
---
pro tip : create one or two alpha scanner account, so you can have 3 to 6 free extra scanner :)
---
Abusing support tickets should be a bannable offense.
---
But tau can't read ?
---
Complexity can add depth, but attributes aren't "good" complexity.  There's always a right answer, and it's easy to solve for.  It's a boring, fake "choice" that doesn't add any real depth to the game.
---
Well the first thing that should have been said that no one has said yet: Get on the test server and try it out. You can buy a carrier for 100 isk on the test server. You can buy plex from the test server store for almost nothing and then buy skill extractors and rearrange your SP to get into a carrier immediately.
---
Part of what made me join WiNGSPAN back in 2016 was its culture, the laid-back attitude, lack of drama/politics and the focus on just having fun.  
---
Prior to my stint at WiNGSPAN I was director of a wormhole corp that was pretty much run by 2 guys with another dozen piggybacking along. While I enjoyed part of the logistics I was spending more time doing director and hole management stuff than playing, while all I wanted to do was have fun in Anoikis. I think if I hadn't switched at the time I might have stopped playing for a while.
---
What I really like about WiNGSPAN is that everyone's pretty much equal, members are generally inclusive and there's very little elitism (although there's always "characters", you know who you are ;)) . They don't give much shit about the stupid losses (I've got those too) or killboards... as long as the skirmish was fun-positive, we're all content. :)
---
So thanks /u/wingspantt for creating this corp that I continue having fun in.
---
For any combat at all you want the Magic 14. They feel pretty boring to train, but at least get them to 4. You will find that when you go to fit your ships you can cram a LOT more on with fitting skills and get a real advantage. Some of the best fits are extremely tight.
---
That's a whole lot of wirds for what is basically soon tm
---
Idk man, better the devil you know than the one you don't.
---
You think having a ratter be able to easily see an incoming attacker in a WH or having zero way to seed without being seen as a great mechanic?

---
I’m glad someone else found it funny. Some people are not going to be happy
---
There is sort of.
---
Those Implants are potentially worth Billions individually, so not only do you get a nice killmail to feel good about for 5 seconds, but you also help the ingame economy.
---
Not really who are you?
---
You must be so elite!
---
make FW like in 08, make fw great again
---
Nah bruh, "supers" are op. Carriers are garbo.
---
tbh kunmi or someone said here goons were going to withdraw anyways around that time they did. The "because drifters" was mostly a narative. Instead of telling your members "this player vs citadel experience sucks and all our fc's and multiboxers are burning out, they put it on drifters. I wouldn't worry about that. Last year was was vastly different with multiple contested timers. Even if the wars were located in null the other regions become affected because of logistics, industry and impact on markets, making modules, ships and materials worth more and making people undock to gather those ressources and haul them. 
---
All the empires blueing each other to share the fruits of perimeter markets is a whole different story and in a way emergent gameplay and in another way is a result of 1. how overpowered a keepstar is in hi sec and 2. the taxation situation. 3. the resources being infinite in null. All of this makes no sense for major entities to go to war unless it's for a moral revenge, like goons did to NC.
---
I've got a Loki fit for just this, I'll update this comment as soon as I get home.
---
we have gathered here today on reddit, to remember and recognize Dato’s dedication to his, and our corp’s Killboard. He did it for a cause, he did it for the isk poaitive, he dis it for the karma. 
---
bless Dato Koppla
---
Yeah but for it to be authentic, you need to multibox incursuses and fly a vexor - so it's like controlling your fighters.
---
No one wants to live in a C3-HS unless they are insane, a 5bil mass hole with a 300m per-ship limit is retarded.
---
C4-C3/C5 could be ok for newer groups - they can use the C3 for solo PvE and the C5 for rolling for content and/or group C5 PvE.
---
Civ 5 on 2nd screen and youtube behind me playing music on the tv
---
Ideally you fill both accs with 3 chars/ea so that if you get evicted you have spare suicide roller characters.
---
Or you know.... put faction ones in LP stores.
---
Yes, Imperium and Test are blue
---
Neither will ever fully die because each has enough hopeless stockholm syndrome cases to keep the servers up. At least WoW players aren't so desperate as to blame it entirely on bots leaving.
---
Nah people are still playing.
---
Im gay
---
It happened years ago, but you did. Suitonia set up a pos in Huola and warped nados to the station to try kill my links at your behest. I guess I’m just a wee nobody to remember someone with a CSM 9-11 tag paying Suitonia to kill me.
---
You know you are in AUTZ when you are flying an interceptor for the first time and the enemy has already warped away and the FC is yelling at your for being afk.....
---
Define "everyone".
---
I most likely didn't pay Suitonia anything for that if it happend tho. He would do that shit for free if you ask him. But yeah years ago I wouldn't remember
---
That hasn´t been the status quo since 2014. Last time i checked local was a thing back then.
---
Just because they affect every ship you fly, they are not all very important.
---
 [https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility) 
---
Look at long term trends.
---
I don't think this is what you meant to say, try again? My entire point was that local was a thing with consistent, massive, huge fights still happening.
---
ZOMGZOR EVE IS DYING!!!111ONEONEONE!!!!
---
::continues to play because it has been doing so forever::
---
Oh I don't know, well fitted or not there are still things that can be done to it to defang it.
---
If it makes your victim salty - it pays off
---
I say we burn a land mark or two... &gt;.&gt;
---
From what I read they achieve most but not everything they wanted to in the north.  Something about EVE Mogul and super production.    
---
"1. how overpowered a keepstar is in hi sec and 2. the taxation situation."  and on to this there was tidi ,server load issues, and fatigue . 
---
"3. the resources being infinite in null. All of this makes no sense for  major entities to go to war unless it's for a moral revenge, like goons  did to NC." Well when Goons controlled the North for years no one took their space for the ice and Caldari Ice was artificially kept it at a high price cause they cartel it.  No one invaded them until Lenny bank rolled  WWB with IWI, because other powers are honestly too chicken shit unless their little to no risk to them.  I was in NC. during WWB.
---
Let me lay it out, it simply removes faith in CCP that they know what to do for eve, if that is the case, it removes a lot of incentive to play because it seems like a waste.
---
C2's have less neut pressure, you can see all dps/ewar effects for different sites here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8bz99o/karrs\_modified\_rykkis\_guide\_12/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8bz99o/karrs_modified_rykkis_guide_12/)
---
There's literally nothing hat cannot be described as a fake "choice".  It's a game.  Even having a skills system at all is such a thing.  The original idea in Eve was that skills accelerated learning, whereas actually using the item improved  it.   I trained up Afterburner from I to III buy using it (in the beta). 
---
If you want to replace attributes because snowflakes can't do thinking because thinking is hard, why not replace all skills because, well, what better way to train a skill than to use the thing you're training the skill for.
---
I am. Now what? The biggest mistake CCP made was catering exclusively to people who didn´t want to be. In a sandbox game where the only redeeming quality and driving force was player ambition and motivation. How the fuck is that supposed to work? 
---
Protip: It didn´t.
---
So quit, either you play or you dont.  No one is forcing you to continue playing.  If you do not enjoy, dont play.  Its the response I give anyone complaining about a change in a MMO.

---
&gt;So basically you must understand an important thing, if one day 0.0 become less rentable than WH for a massive coalition size. Guess what, the hormone will burn and big coalition will just take them all. 
---
So what you're saying is that umbrella mining in delve wouldn't be viable anymore nullbears would spread out in wormholes, with no backup, and actually risk their ships?
---
Numbers are pretty even in CNTZ/AUTZ, which is all that really matters with structure timers being set by defenders.
---
I am not getting on more killmails this year compared to last year. 2019 July I have 87 kills. Mostly from small gangs and baiting.
---
2018 July I have 157 kills. Mostly from stratops.
---
2017 July I have 83 kills. Mostly from blopsing.
---
I am greatly enjoying blackout, But the exact number of kills I am getting on is not really much higher or lower.
---
We'll call them out on their bullshit if they cite logins as to why the blackout will stay. It will get downvoted, more dank memes about how the blackout is good and twilight level fan-fiction trying to make it seem like everything's great will get upvoted.  
---
In the end, it will just be pvp people cloaked looking for pvp people, who are also cloaked. **And they'll applaud.**
---
First eve is dying threads on forums started in 2003 (the release year).
---
How much time do you have to dedicate to your gaming session so that you can run an incursion? Is it something that you can do if you have only 30 mins or 45 mins of gametime?
---
This won't affect traders in any way.
---
Hey Falcon, any chance we ever see those changes you mentioned to capital ships? I for one agree capitals have no place in ganking small ships and ratting...
---
You can anchor structures in Hek tho.
---
User name checks out. For real though, no one understands the horror of AUTZ latency till they've experienced it.
---
I mean.. it was soon... wasn’t it?
---
You need to understand the difference between crabs and pve players . crabs are the guys with no concept of loyalty or teamwork they are the first to evaq in invasions and the last to log in and help defend
---
CCP has \*always\* pulled numbers out of their ass, even when they're publicly available and they subsequently get humiliated.  In fact, it's not just numbers, they have a habit of outright lying when there's cached proof that they're lying.  You'd think they'd learn eventually, but learning doesn't seem to be in their nature.
---
It’s not about not wanting to be social and play with others. It’s that since this game mirrors a lot of real life activities to keep the war engine going in corporations there are bound to be less glamorous and frankly dull as fuck duties that need to be done. Those are done by alts in the background.
---
By the time all 400 titans have dropped the first set is off aids again!
---
Look at your downvotes and my upvotes now back to your downvotes
---
cuz half the people that would normally be playing are on Reddit instead
---
If you think Pearl Abyss taking over is a good idea you've clearly never looked at Black Desert Online.
---
&gt;because thinking is hard
---
imagine being so dumb that you think the attribute system requires "thought"
---
CCP will parrot BS if it fits their narrative no matter what it costs them.  Look at the dozen failed games, firing of most of their talent, and being forced to sell out to avoid bankruptcy as proof.  Through all of it they were talking about how amazing they were doing and "everything's normal!"
---
o7
---
You mean like sensor damps?
---
I don't think anyone believes the blackout is a magic pill.
---
We believe it's just a possible step. We're mostly just wanting to support CCP in trying for extreme solutions as opposed to only going with what is "safe".
---
How the hell does a ceptor maintain tackle on a curse?
---
There shouldn't be npc taxes in sov null, you are right.
---
can explosions in ghost sites actually deal pure explosive damage. You can tank a heron to survive them.
---
If you haven't been shooting caldari all day everyday for the past three months, your faction standing won't be low enough to matter (corp/ally standing is the average of the member's standings iirc), so go ahead. Also you have nothing to lose by asking a recruiter. I'm pretty sure that if you get rejected because of your standings (**if**), they'll be more than happy to tell you how you can raise them.
---
Probably 4 years ago.
---
I think I remember them announcing the change before I left 5 years ago, but maybe I'm misremembering since I would sporadically check this sub.
---
Null sucks ass atm
---
How is 3 days later not "Soon"?
---
You don't even know what data they're looking at so how could you possibly even make an assumption like that? 
---
Oh wait...another Grrr Blackout post....move along
---
Fair point, not sure how CCP regards Hek. It (Metro) does the same value of trade as Rens / Heimatar (10 to 12 trillion a month). The Boundless Creation station could be used, or Hek could be excluded since it might not fall into the Hub definition.
---
(Just to be clear, I've been advocating for attribute removal for a fair time now. And attribute implants to be replaced with training accelerators of varying durations (persistent through death))
---
Killing pods results in... dead pods.
---
Apart from that... the market in implants needs to be kept alive*.
---
Praise James! www.minerbumping.com
---
*Important for a friend.
---
Yup.
---
I haven't actually ever done carrier l5s, just read about them.
---
I just do know that, from my own experience in lowsec, I ignore capitals I see on dscan because they are basically possible to catch, or already in a pos, so I have learned not to bother.
---
But seeing one on the gate will make it super obvious.
---
I like your attitude, here's my upvote cptn.
---
Nullsec isn't for new players.
---
I remember when a Smartbomber showed up to an RvB Gank fleet.... good times!
---
(it was not me)
---
CCP made changes to the game that have caused other issues. The problem here is CCP and their design choices. 
---
However, if we are gonna talk about people needing to adapt and not bitch and moan **guess how the blackout came about?** I'll give you a hint, it's the pot calling the kettle black.
---
Haha wow, wish I was in comms to hear that one
---
It will limit low lvl speculation, and hit demand with higer prices.
---
This is actually buff to nullsec coalitions trade hubs and internal market.
---
Thank you for correcting :)
---
Wouldn't it be possible to attack someone without giving them time to withdraw as much as they want...
---
Of course... but, as the conspiracy theories say, no one is interested in real change.
---
I mean, back in my day as a pirate we killed pods because it was the badass pirate thing to do, particularly if someone did not pay a ransom--but we would kill pods without asking for ransoms half the time. 
---
I guess I am saying, I don't get why "he had no implants, so podding him was for nothing" attitude. I guess I really do not understand the isk ration people gravitate towards on killboards these days rather than victory percentage.
---
If it doesn't require thought, what's the problem?  I mean apparently you can just leave it.
---
Perhaps the real problem here is people don't want to lose relatively expensive implants and that this thread is basically whining about that with a cloaking device design based around argumentum ad newplayerexperience.
---
Yes it benefits them, but not so much in a "now you're stronger than a newb cause you injected to all 5s" way as a "now you can try something new without breaking the bank" way.
---
Red vs Blue are good dudes, I highly recommend them.
---
Do you remember the CCP timespan for soon^TM?
---
There are worse things to spend taxes on!
---
You dont hear what you are saying? Give us the advantage to kill stuff without any form of counter. Thats already mostly what the blackout is about, you want even more advantage?
---
"Prevent more fights", are you high? Stop with this narrative. You dont get more fights when no one is around to fight, you get that right?
---
You know what, I actually want all these changes. I want the elite pvpers to get their every wet dream. Cause it will take about 1-2 weeks for the entire game to break after that. 
---
So when Eve is dead, atleast then the idiots might understand that they are in fact, idiots.
---
He's looking at login numbers, seeing an increase and basing it off thoses numbers.
---
Except the daily login numbers are up due to the Skilling Spree giveaway. Most of these logins are logon kill 1 to 10 rats, logoff.
---
They screwed any possible comparison of this summer to any past year because of that, the blackout and the VNI changes hitting within a month of each other. 
---
They need to either end or extend the Skilling Spree timeframe to get a suitable data set to ise in comparisons. And even then they are comparing  July 2019 to august 2019.
---
I'd say reasonably you need an hour or two, otherwise it just becomes a hassle not just for you but the fleet as well. And that's after you already traveled to the incursion system, of course.
---
They used to lose contests to valhalla as well, mostly because they're more hodge podge/elitist
---
While I get what your hidden point it, he is not wrong.  All of the vast history of eve has happened with local.
---
Mind you..whats magic 14?
---
Nothing has to replace it.  An unfun mechanic goes away.
---
Because who doesn't love supporting an alliance propped up by bots and RMT?
---
This is a good piece of propaganda.
---
I can always appreciate these posts.
---
I agree its not a good way to do something to level out the playing field somewhat.
---
Imo the ideal way to redistribute isk from the wealthy to the not is accelerators or similar items. Things appealing to players who want more sp but aren't getting great returns on injectors, that aren't "worth the time" for vets to do events for just for the rewards. Then rich folks buy them from poor folks.
---
TEST flair. uhhhhhhhhh
---
Not really. It takes a bit to get a fleet invite depending on the time of day, and the sites themselves take a variable amount of time depending on the fleet and site(5-15 mins) . If you get lucky you might be able to get in fleet and run 1 or 2, but it will likely during the slow timezones where they just need a warm body.
---
&gt;m8, D-scan that doesnt update automatically is a real problem. My Left indexfinger is about to give up.
---
There is part of your problem, the thumb works better on the V-key
---
I'd be all for a local that delays, 1-10 minutes based on an ihub upgrade or something that can be entosis'd. But the current iteration of no local makes cyno/cov cyno + cloak overwhelmingly powerful and for anything not a capital in space the dynamic has changed from risk vs. reward to suicide vs. reward. (I'm saying this as someone that has mostly converted to pvp over the last two years and would like that invisible time frame to catch someone, but see the risk for a subcap as so high currently to a blops meta that they will simply stop being out there.)
---
What are the reqs?
---
There should be TIFUEVE sub...
---
You can see it in the market, Jita used to be a swiss clock. I mean a couple of years ago it was super strong, always packed with everything and you couldnt break it with speculation in that sense. You could affect it but it was too vibrant to break.
---
Now prices on certain mods are through the roof cause of extremely low volume and you can as an individual break aspects of it with ease.
---
You should probably post this on /r/evememes
---
But I love it nonetheless
---
So That whole MMDS thing is good too fam?
---
I know a blops can bridge from highsec. The question is: does that mean you go suspect or does it cause an aggression timer?
---
Also, does it affect ship mass while activated?
---
It's also something of an annoyance trying to invite people to fleet.. with no local, that aren't in your corp... or when corp chat is broken as well. I guess.. x up in alliance chat?
---
...said the goon that flies side by side with panfam and tapi
---
It wasn't just me, we had initial tackle with a Jaguar, I got secondary with my Malediction + Stratios and then the entire cavalry showed up. I opted to orbit close as I had a nos and I wanted to scram him as he was burning away.
---
I mean... there are like 100 dudes that won EVE years ago that post all the time.
---
PSA: You're all now water down renters of Goon Horde Please Ignore.
---
Hmmm that explains the falling ADMs and flipping ihubs.
---
I mean, this is the logical conclusion of CCP's dev method.  Before, they made some dumb shit, put it on Sisi, ignored all feedback and bug reports, and then ported it to Tranq.  At least now they're skipping the middleman.
---
Eve will not go to a better place with PA at the reins. With that being said, here in a few months CCP finds out how much they are getting for Eve. Expect a huge shakeup at the office, including some big names.
---
Our alliance leader wasn't banned for RMT, nor were we on CCP Peligros chart of botting alliances. Fraternity can't say the same.
---
You can meme about TEST all you want but the data speaks for itself.
---
Well, I wouldn't complain about podding an empty enemy pod - I do it all the time. The only issue is that I did it at the cost of 1 bill of my own.
---
Better rush through changes to stuff the pockets of GSM 4head
---
I can't believe a tusker pilot commented on my thread! &gt;\_&lt; so honoured
---
So getting paid 600b per month by KWG for 3 years was just a happy little accident?
---
I feel like any retort I make is just going to end up with you digging your heels in and playing out your own narrative in your head so vOv enjoy the summer m8
---
Maledictions often fit a nos to maintain tackle on targets with neuts, although you'd probably get wrecked by drones pretty quickly trying to stay in nos range
---
Accounting (Trade) 	radius: 0.0 =&gt; 1.0  
---
we finaly getting real market pvp.. 0,1 isk:ing deals 1 damage to all other traders of that item /s
---
PSA:You are all now water down renters of Goon Horde Please Ignore.  Ftfy
---
Would be interesting, but the whole point of attribute implants is that they don't have a duration, unless I lose my clone that is.
---
Would be interesting to offer a single training speed multiple implant instead of the attribute implants.
---
It solves the whole "confusing for newbros" part and keeps existing functionality.
---
But I can also see the drive for timed boosters
---
I’m curious, is this in a black hole per chance? Do  WH effects even work on citadel weapons now that I think about it.
---
You should apply to CCP.
---
If people wanted fights, there'd be fights. But when it takes 4+ hours of baiting a 0.0 alliance inside their own space to fight your mixed-ship \~40-man sub-cap fleet it's rather clear people don't want to.
---
Maybe they dont look at data thats been affected by the login rewards etc. and noone said that the blackout is supposed to fix all the issues the game has. It is an experiment to cut down on perfect intel and they stated multiple times that they plan to do a lot of those experiments which will address other problems. Have a bit of patience, they cant do all at once.
---
Secretly, AUTZ has always had local delay. Also, grid delay. AUTZ is the most authentic EVE experience
---
Limiting mass per cyno is a no go.
---
Light cyno jump max mass amount. Ship that just jumped to the cyno lights another cyno max mass jumos again, repeat until finished.
---
Market tax changes aren't a good start on a fix. You've got market capture here. People want to shop in one place which is why supermarkets have won over greengrocers and butchers. If a market doesn't normally have enough stock variety to let you shop for what you want you get in to the habit of going elsewhere.
---
For a market to get repeat customers it needs a vast variety of goods (supermarket) or else it is a specialist shop where you know you'll get what you want for a task you often want to do.
---
Player owned markets make the vast majority of their profits on plex and injectors because people will go shopping for those items as their entire shopping basket and don't actually need to travel to the market to pick it up (injectors) or don't have to worry about collecting their shopping with anything more than an alt in a travel ceptor (plex). This combines with per-shopping trip value to vastly outweigh anything else.
---
From a stocker's view what you want is a high enough footfall buying your stuff. If potential customer's aren't showing up then in Eve you aren't going to really do enough advertising to change patterns.
---
I mean, if your entire goal is to catch bots (which are npc programs)... why aren't you just killing NPCs?
---
Now if only they’d apply the literal definition to “delayed” and we’d arrive a nearly a perfect middle ground.
---

They are the basic skills help fit things onto your ship by reducing requirements like CPU and Power for modules. This means that you can squeeze in better modules or different modules than you normally could.

Gotcha. Guess I shoulda checked the km.

Great video and explanations man. +1 keep the content coming even it doesnt have a bazillion upvotes cause its not blob warfare.

Trades Kiss the ring or pay the freedom tax.

It's like throwing people into a meatgrinder
---
Enjoy your 5 minutes of fame!
---
Are you new? When CCP says soon you're usually lucky to get it in the next 3 months.
---
Renting to shitty people is bad, but it's not even close to what Fraternity has done by openly encouraging botting and RMT within their ranks. KWG took years to get to 2%, Fraternity Treasury took months to get to 5%. That's a culture of corruption on an industrial scale.
---
Traders kiss the ring ir pay the freedom tax.
---
Lately a corpmate was camped in to a nullsec system so we went on a rescue mission in expendable ships. I went in a buffer fit Hurricane Fleet Issue. We had a good fight with the campers but they eventually got us. I did not worry about my pod because I knew that it is only cheap fitting and learning implants. After they podded my I noticed that it was my mid-grade Crystal set. :)
---
thanks dude don't know there is a special meme subreddit WOUHHHH!!!
---
detorid though... oof
---
Yup i just started playing 3 days ago!
---
&gt; there are ingame channels in which people will sell a wormhole to you, oftentimes also with the customs offices. 
---
In my experience, those channels are too expensive for easier to find holes.
---
some good advice already posted. Just a short comparison to other playstyles and what you can expect:
---
* Initiative: WH gameplay lives and dies with people being active and willing to put in the work, more so than in k-space.
---
* Self Sufficiency: WH groups become very tight and helpful to each other eventually. But you still need to be self sufficient to a higher degree than in NS. Multiple accounts are usaully a result of this.
---
* Pugnacity: if you don't fight, chances of an eviction increase. E-bushido is real for a lot of wormholers, so don't run from a fair fight. Blue balling like in NS is frowned upon in j-space. After all, Bob needs his sacrifice.
---
Did you forget the /s?
---
At least they didn't steal Proviblocs  stations.
---
As some one who's played through the time of learning skills, no attribute remaps, having to pay for clones (I was at 130mil per clone before they pulled it)... Honestly the current system is fine... It rewards the people who want to work to min/Max and doesn't overly punish those who don't or can't.  The three year break I took between 2013 and 2016 completely fucked any advantage I might have gotten by perfect remaps and skill plans and implants, and I don't know many older players who haven't taken a break and lost training time... Not that there aren't any, but I doubt it's a big proportion of the player base, just based on my own anecdotal observations.
---
Could we replace the system with something simpler? Probably, might even be a good idea, but imo this just is pretty far down the list of things that need to be fixed/updated relative to our other issues.
---
Ugh, complain more, please
---
What, you wanted us to give them to PL? Fuck that noise, lol
---
Pullers give you extra free decline every 4 hours, each. So you don't actually decline with abandon, you just switch characters who request missions.
---
name channels pls
---
rather pay more taxes than fund tapi
---
I suggest you go read Waffles post from yesterday.
---
Bye krab, you won’t be missed
---
I love burning miners alive ( in game )
---
You would get your money back if you paid for insurance and didnt do anything wrong(because you can never drop to hull unless you are AAA in tcrc and even when you are doing that, it has a very low chance of happening) Next time pay for the insurance and you will be fine :) I find incursions to be the best isk making job (excluding market manipulation) because you make the same money as a ratting carrier with no risks at all. I am glad you started running incursions ^^
---
“Own supers” - I rat in a Hel/Nyx
---
Reminds me of this time that Jebi (an Eve Streamer) self destructed his 'empty' pod, only to find out it was a 1bil pod lol
---
lets make this dead zone  low sec , Mysterious and even deader zone,,
---
Are they really though? I never would have gotten into this game if not for being able to play for a month or so as an Alpha clone, and from everything I've heard the game would be in a very bad state if the influx back in 2016 hadn't happened.
---
why do people call me gay in local?
---
Thats why i went for Kill information.  Compare how much stuff got blown up this July vs last 2 Julys
---
imagine passionately defending your alliance on fucking reddit of all places
---
Xdddddddddddd
---
I KNOW!!! Like what the hell, imagine not being EXACTLY THE SAME AS ME!!!
---
Ruining the game tbh.
---
OP I know this is a month old post but if you're still around, I'd suggest joining Goonswarm. The goon """culture""" that involved acting like massive spergs and throwing around slurs died around 2016 by everything I've seen, and things are pretty nice now. We also have Sirenswarm (for women, transwomen accepted too) and Queerswarm as SIGs. You can bet they're the best SIGs in the game.
---
I mean, there is a treaty involved. A treaty that Init actually agreed to and signed off on. Init has no such agreements with Snuff.
---
The funny thing is all of you fund TAPI in some way. Thank you for your donations.
---
Yes, they are 100% freeloading off of the money the rest of us inject into the game. Their occasional PLEX purchase for some SKiNs don't keep the game going, subscriptions do.
---
Only a small group of people can run incursions, meanwhile everyone can run anomalies in null.
---
Paying rent =//= paying off everyone not to invade them
---
Because fuck the rest of your space, right?
---
Whormoler, BTW.
---
ummmm corpses?
---
Is brain damage really mildly amusing tho
---
You really should read the post you replied to again.
---
The keepstar itself isn’t actually that powerful at all. It’s been reinforced multiple times, and on none of those fights did it’s defenses do anything significant to our fleets. We once spent 5 hours in a giant ferox v ferox brawl there and despite roughly equal numbers compared to test/goons, and having to waste time shooting the structure, we came out isk positive. It was by a fairly negligible amount, yes, but the point is the keepstar wasn’t able to effect the battle significantly. 
---
2 is obvious, but I don’t think the resources have anything to do with it. OTEC did just fine in the old days of passive moon mining
---
As long as it's not happening to me.
---
Right his gripe is bots. So I am curious why he just won't quit because they haven't gotten rid of bots. /dur
---
Imagine being a goon in eve of all places
---
You sir are a true Lowsec'er o7, I pray these changes become real every single one of them.
---
I heard Wingspan can look up a hole for you, but never had to use them, thankfully
---
“Steal”  = “Used better tactics and organized for an objective and was successful in scoring phat lootz that were available for literally anyone with the skill and ability to take”
---
Sure fam you can roll with that
---
Fun fact: In 2019 if you willingly PVP outside of CTAs you're automatically considered part of the elite PVPer club.
---
Thank you for pulling numbers. 
---
That interview was a joke dude, it was a competition to see who could do the most outlandish statements and get away with it. I mean, highest MAU/DAU? Login numbers got tainted sure, but to even propose that half the login numbers (in comparison to 5 years ago) would somehow generate higher real player MAU/DAU is a massive joke. Especially considering we have more multiboxing, bots and skillfarms nowadays.
---
And not to mention that the blackout was probably the biggest temporary anti-bot mechanic to happen in probably forever. To think that such an action wouldnt warrant a reaction like tons more bots being made and put in other places like HS is a childish assumption. This would certainly taint MAU/DAU in ways players wouldnt but lets all forget that bots exist.
---
Its just a shitty test, pure and simple. Tons of variables and really no control making any sort of conclusion irrelevant. The only data I actually "trust", even tho it can and should be argued against, is the inital weekends login drop. That number was the least tainted due to its timing.
---
*dumbbombed
---
So I think you don’t get the reference which is tough because reading comprehension.  But this is saying to frat members to get out and rat and rat (like a labor camp) because they need those ticks to fund their shitty alliance.  Since blackout killed their main income source, botting vni ratting, they need to amp up the pressure on ratters to get out there.  
---
But you think it’s a TTT reference.  
---
So cute.
---
warp to me? More like warp to TPPH.
---
ha gottem
---
Keep Working chinese slaves!
---
Chance logs in like once or twice a month. His directors do all the management. He does nothing. 
---
Wingspanners are 'tards. The guy that said Wingspanners believe higher cost = more combat effectiveness is spot on. These guys spend billions on T3 cruisers with 6-month-old toons and will camp for days (literally days) to catch a Heron or a Magnate. It's so ridiculously cringey that I had to leave.
---
Don't believe the BS about the laid back non-elitism. That's not exactly true either. They get mad at you if you don't send the stupid gloating "delivery receipt". They get mad if you aren't flying an SoE ship or a T3 cruiser. They get mad if you kill shit in low sec or null sec rather than in a wormhole. I saw a guy have a meltdown in corp chat because another guy had racked up a bunch of kills with bombers bar. Tuefel Mordor (sp?) is seriously an asshole to a lot of people. He's one of the primary reasons I quit. 
---
There's also this other guy... Luigi Calder-something or other. He's abrasive, rude, and has horrible, *horrible* comms discipline. I saw gangs miss out on kills multiple times because this idiot wouldn't shut the fuck up and stop talking over everybody. I never saw an acting "FC" call him out.
---
Sure, Wingspan there are some positives to Wingspan, like the Tripwire intel, or the fact that no one expects your piloting to be worth a shit since you're in Wingspan. I just find it ridiculous that someone interviews a guy for his elite corp management skillz when he... doesn't... manage... the... corp. Try Nikki Ikala next time.
---
The caldari carrier is regarded as somewhat poor, but the phoenix is seen as an excellent anti-subcap dread.
---
It’s almost getting to be fuck detorid, what, with 3 more tcu flipped and ihub fights on the daily.   
---
But yeah let’s not talk about wicked and scalding amirite
---
I agree, get back to the belts boys.
---
TTT reference and in dank content.  The rare double reference.  Well done tapi bro
---
Worse things to spend taxes on than into frats wallet?
---
Is there a good way to harass a larger alliance that we are at war with as a solo/duo in low sec (14m SP)? I feel like I just get gangbanged at every turn when I undock alone, even camping Dscan and such, so I end up staying docked up and waiting for others to log in so we can roam in a small gang. I just wish there was something I could harass with and actually do something useful instead of station spinning. I'm willing to do pretty much anything to rustle some jimmies.
---
And for the most part with less 3rd party infrastructure and data analysis tools which really only reached their ubiqutous and dominant presence since the early years of the second decade. Instant intel has become a huge problem in and out of game. Local might not have been a problem for the largest part of eves history. But with the methods of datamining the community has established until this point in time it has become one. No local is the easist (albeit not most subtle) way of dealing with this problem and to get an idea of how the community reacts if you don´t want to block access to a shitton of APIs and the way logs are handled clientside. 
---
I agree that the removal of local is a tad hamfisted and doesn´t adress many other dominant problems the game has. But one way or another the availability of instant intel concerning vast parts of the game needs to go. All these options will piss off the parts of the playerbase that have grown accustomed to the safety these mechanism currently provide and will have to make them adapt their skillset more so than the people who don´t need and rely on this infrastructure exclusively. There is no way around that. And it will piss these people off one way or another.
---
Well, guess I will be hoarding stuff till they change this.
---
They were just my opinions mate, I'm not a game designer :)
---
TEST hasnt called a CTA in a LONG time
---
I wish there was more golden ammo so Olmeca could finally kill the goon.
---
It's not like we have the ability to filter data or anything, right?
---
ngl, probably gonna give WoW classic a go myself :)

THey should remove the posibility of placing an item 1 cent below another. It's imposible to sell anything because no matter what price I put, someone else will offer 1 cent less in no time.

Stealth bombers.

I have run a bunch of ghost sites in a strat with no issue. High sec even with a t1 analyser you can get all four cans easily. Same with low sec. Null and WH your best hope is two maybe three if you are fast. Running with two EANM, rep, and a MWD I have had no issues with tank but also that is with amarr cruiser V. 
---
Basically warp in clocked. Start moving to first can. Drop cloak and activate MWD. Furiously hack the can and move the the next one. When the rats land burn off and rep you should be able to either hold until they leave our get out of point range. 
---
Not sure what space you are in but process is basically the same for all sites. Important thing is don't drop cloak until you are ready to hack. I think I read on eveuni wiki clock does not start if you warp in cloaked
---
Dead Terrorists, now that's a name I haven't seen in a while.
---
I hope too, that this is temporary like here in Finland... car-tax.  They invented it 1958 for temporary solution because nation was short on cash. Now its permanent :)
---
yes same here
---
extreme cancer
---
Thank god the spike in Trit prices will cover my increased taxes.
---
I remember that discord. A couple of unpleasant people made me leave it after a day.
---
Trying not to throw around the "t" word, but it was anything but nice how certain people (figuratively) "threw stones" at others for their decisions they made in game.
---
I wonder, what had happened to the "FW community". Makes me sad. Good luck saving FW though. To me it looks like CCP seems not to care about it.
---
He's flare baiting.
---
Congratulations....?
---
Yeah because you don't need to ban that many bots when they're all in Supers.
---
If you wanna be mad about botting join a different alliance
---
I considered this, but in lowsec I'm limited to torps, so what would my targets be? I have a hound in a relevant system and looked around last night, but it was stuff like Proteus and Ravens. As a new player I'm not sure how to decide what to fight. The Raven seems like a total no go, and I'd need like 4 volleys on a Proteus with no tank I think?
---
You mean the NIP didn't let you build a big enough war chest?
---
Although the drifter thing was a bit of a narrative there was still truth in it. Like outlandish numbers, several hundred attacks on infrastructure/day forced reactions. The same goes with the blackout and the rest of the "announced" changes like you say. Chaos is instability and during unstable times people lock down and try to wait it out.
---
And since most changes relate to defense it will most def hurt the offense. The same changes proposed to make the game more active will make it much more stale. If they go ahead with their changes, this year will probably be the most boring year in the game in a very long time.
---
It's all about sneaking around and finding vulnerable targets. Taking on a Raven in a stealth bomber should be doable if you can avoid or take out their drones.
---
Yay Goons!  
---
Wait... whut?
---
It would seem something is happening in Detorid:p:)
---
Hmm I was  hunting in goons territory ones went in to a one star gate system and  played harresed a few ships in there sites , you guys had set up a 60 men gate camp up lol 😂 
---
I attacked a domi earlier it mjd away from me so I knew I had  30 sec to bail out.
---
Went to my ping above the gate cloaked ofc was thinking well how am going to get trough that ? 
---
I decided to just keep hunting some more , found a myrm ratting attacked it , it has mjd out but this time I warped back to my ping above gate and to my surprise everyone on that gate has moved to the site leaving the gate clear for me , I waltz right out of there.
---
Don’t get me wrong I enjoy solo hunting I do it on all 3 toons but it soooooo time consuming and the content in return although fun is extremely short.
---
Trust my goons I been all over delve but Eve has so much to offer and meh solo pvp is well overrated imo.
---
CCP: Fuck it, we're doing it live
---
Explosion does seem to account for resists because the cans only take some armor of that strat. I would think you should tank just fine in that Loki again depending of what ones you are running. 
---
Sisi is always a good idea to try first
---
If /r/eve has taught me anything it's that we're all game designers.
---
Same universe where the world died because no one ever questioned anything?
---
&gt; Thukker Tribe Deny Claims of "Militarized City Ship Project Hidden in Drone Regions"  
---
umm
---
Everytime i read detorid i read it as detroit
---
Wwhoever is in charge of the game will be the target of player ire, reddit will be full of tears and capsuleers will keep logging in (especially with those sweet daily login rewards).
---
I personally can't wait for a Trig 'enhancing' system where you grind for modules then attempt to combine them for a 0.0015% chance at creating an OP mod with random stats (higher chance of success if you have PA Slave implants available from the plex store.) Looking at BDO I wouldn't be shocked if they changed skill queues to only count down while you are logged in (but it's ok guys cause you can system tray the game.)
---
Just resubbed after not playing for a couple years. Mostly did FW and exploration the last time I played. I can fly Amarr cruisers and covops with good support skills, and I have all the prereqs for Logi and Recons.
---
What are some good WH or 0.0 groups I could join?
---
I jump cloned to jita to buy some some skills and various other things. That clone was my own snake set with other various hardwirings. About 10 minutes later my corp rage pinged to form to fight an enemy fleet coming into our system. I wanted to go, but I jump cloned. (Keep in mind I'm several beers deep right now). I said screw it let's go, so I death cloned. Not until after an hour later after the engagement i realized i blew my pod up
---
They have started to care a whole lot lately so I think that's an unfair assessment.
---
Whatever the people you find on the Discord, right now CCP has *directly* communicated that they wanted questions from the community, and Hilmar showed that he has the warzone on his mind, and with everything that is happening and the sandbox being finally shaken a bit, now is the time to talk about FW if you care about it.
---
local is just your personal crystal ball
---
Back in the day if they didnt keep their pod updated they would lose skill points.
---
lol
---
Perfect intel is just too much. I get complacent when I can tab over to a random character parked in a choke system.

# GALACTIC HOUR NEWS ROUNDUP: DEATH AND TAXES EDITION

2019-08-01 13:44 By Ret Gloriaxx

The Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx brings your roundup of the latest news from all across New Eden as tax and brokerage rises come into effect across SCC regulated markets.

**SCC Implements Tax and Brokerage Increases as NEDFA Comes into Force**
---
Yulai, Genesis – Following the swift passage in the CONCORD Assembly of the New Eden Defense Fund Act YC121 (NEDFA), the Secure Commerce Commission has implemented the increases in transaction tax and brokerage fees called for by the funding provisions of the legislation. Base tax has increased from 2.00% to 5.00% on SCC market transactions, while the base brokerage fee has risen from 3.00% to 5.00%.

*Above: holo-poster promoting New Eden Defense Fund Act –* [*tax and fee details embedded*](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pvewgz/updates-to-sales-taxes-and-brokers-fees)
---
Improvements to the SCC tax code mean efficient accounting and brokerage negotiations will provide significant reductions in taxes and fees. However, minimum tax and brokerage fees will still be above levels currently achievable through skilled accountancy and good relations with market operators.
---
The DED's Star Marshal Kjersidur Elladall commented, "With the resources provided by the New Eden Defense Fund, the fight against the Triglavian invasion will be joined by renewed fleets and benefit from improved defenses across the cluster."

**Standoff on Intaki Prime as Lai Dai Refuses to Withdraw Forces from Key Locations**
---
Intaki, Placid – Despite protests from the Intaki Assembly, Federal Senate and Mordu's Legion, the Lai Dai Protection Service (LDPS) has refused to withdraw its forces from several locations on Intaki Prime. In legal filings at the Caldari Business Tribunal, Lai Dai representatives confirmed that the Onikanabo Brigade (OB) private military company is operating on the planet under contract with the megacorporation.
---
The fifth planet of the Intaki system, and ancestral homeworld of the large and influential Intaki diaspora, has been the scene of low-intensity conflict since the Onikanabo Brigade and LDPS began operations there almost two months ago. The threat of serious warfighting was at its highest levels when OB and LDPS forces broke out of fortified positions at the Kainta Yavaat Transorbital Launch Facility in the foothills of the Northern Akat Mountains. Their subsequent sweep through Ida monasteries and attached research centers in the region brought them into conflict with units of the Intaki Assembly's militia.
---
Serious fighting was avoided as the overmatched Intaki militia units were forced to retreat south to secured zones around the Intaki administrative capital of Navyii Akat. Units of the Condotta Rouvenor and Isuuaya Tactical PMCs are reported to have established a defensive line around Navyii Akat, while Mordu's Legion has confirmed it has deployed freshly-arrived troops at positions defending Lenoika, the largest city of Intaki Prime and the cultural capital of the planet.
---
Reports of heavily-defended LDPS convoys moving back and forth between Kainta Yavaat and a number of locations in the Northern Akat Mountains have been independently confirmed by CONCORD conflict monitors. Colonel Aina Yuminoro of the LDPS 203rd Combined Asset Protection Regiment issued a statement declaring her unit's operations to be "in accordance with Caldari State corporate law and principles of reclamation from conflict zones and territorial possessions of the Caldari people."
---
The LDPS appear to be anticipating a lengthy stay as Kainta Yavaat's defenses were reportedly augmented last night with detachments of LDC-ISU-8-118 "Orochi" self-propelled multiple rocket launchers and LDC-SOMA-303 "Itsumade" Anti-Aerospace Missile Batteries.

**BREAKING: "Sundsele Six" Missing after Terrorist Attack on Sebiestor Tribal Marshals Convoy Leaves Three Dead**
---
Matar, Pator — A "terrorist attack" on a Sebiestor Tribal Marshals convoy has killed three marshals and apparently resulted in the kidnapping, or escape from custody, of the so-called "Sundsele Six", a group of defense officials from the Mikramurka region under suspicion of negligence or sabotage following a recent Blood Raider attack on the Sundsele urban coastal zone of the Northern continent of Matar.
---
Although reports are confused, it appears that the Sebiestor marshals took charge of the Sundele Six this morning, following their arrival on a secure RSS flight into the Dovkat Airport south of Sundsele proper. A convoy of Tribal Marshals vehicles carrying the prisoners was apparently in transit along the stretch of the Snow-Eater Road between Dovkat and Sundsele when they were assaulted by a heavily-armed force.
---
One report has stated that the Snow-Eater Road was blocked by an overturned road-train, forcing the convoy to slow and attempt to pass by the highway's hard shoulder. The lead and rear vehicles of the convoy were disabled by rocket-propelled grenades while the prisoner transport was passing the road-train. An eye-witness has stated that masked "terrorists" then assaulted the transport and seized the six being held within. The three dead Sebiestor marshals are understood to have been killed in the RPG strikes on their vehicles. Several more marshals are seriously injured and a number of bystanders are suffering from light shrapnel wounds.
---
Responding to the news, Khumatar Allek Berialsh, Matar Planetary Security Co-ordinator, said, "This shocking attack clearly has the aim of thwarting the search for truth and justice over the Sundsele attack. Matar Planetary Security will be assisting the Sebiestor Tribe with every means at its disposal." Chief Acassa Midular of the Sebiestor Tribe said, "My thoughts are with the families of our dead and injured Tribal Marshals, and also with those of the six Mikramurka officials who remain innocent in the eyes of the tribe until otherwise shown to be guilty. Sebiestor security and investigative forces are hard at work on the Snow-Eater Road, in Dovkat and in Sundsele. Justice will be done for all those who have suffered from these vile terrorist attacks."

As an aside, NEC has started with a series of interesting lore facts, where each downtime we will tweet a random fact about EVE lore. Check the #TheLoreYouKnow hashtag, or my twitter for (re)tweets:  [https://twitter.com/ISD\_Thalack](https://twitter.com/ISD_Thalack)
---
Pretty low effort
---
We, non EN speaking people are infra-human for CCP. People who speak spanish for example, the second most spoken language on the world, are ignored by CCP for ages. You can find indie games on Steam launched on EN, FRA, GER, RUS and ESP... But a Game like EvE, in 16 years, never cared... So, extra info on launcher for non EN speakers is an utopia.
---
That be said, tell your buds to play the game anyway. We are playing EvE online, not Local-Chat Online. Or, they can move to Highsec (low sec must be too dangerous for them)
---
Fucking CCP logic:   
---
The 1% is too rich, wee need to do something.  
---
also CCP, dear 1% enjoy the trillions of isk from our market changes
---
So, forever?
---
There are plenty of ways to do it but none of them will involve balancing small scale with big scale. Right now the entire premise is that NS could and should entertain small gangs. Instead of actually allowing/forcing small gang to entertain small gang activity. 
---
Its like doing PvP in any arena related setting, you bring equal numbers and gear otherwise your chance of winning is extremely slim. So instead of forcing this we are instead trying to make one side weaker so that the people who dont have the numbers and gear still stand a chance. Its a "cool" thing but not very smart.
---
You're going (angel face)
---
Well, there was no coomunication needed before at all, so that's definetly a downgrade. 
---
Before: 
---
Wanted to warp whole fleet to savespot after jumping gate? Check Fleetmembers in local and start fleetwarp if all are visible.
---
Now:
---
Is everyone through? Yes. Yes. Jup. Yes. Bob, are you through too? Bob? Yes. Ok, take fleetwarp.
---
Maybe the data they are collecting has more depth than a check box, "Did player log in" Don't think you it would be easy to discount people logged in for 15 minutes or less from a report? I'm assuming they have the capability to remove unusual trends.
---
If you're a farmer that depends on pigs wallowing in their own shit to survive, you will take care of said pigs and will try to satisfy their piggish needs. That doesn't mean that you would consider pigs your peers or even somehow superior. You just show them some understanding for their lesser statute and acknowledge their place in your world and moan that they stink, are stupid but you can't live without them.   
---
A pig knows not how to do anything else but eat and get fat, much like the average "pve player" in eve.   
---
It is perfectly alright for solo pvp players to have a sense of superiority over the common farm stock, in the context of the game because 
---
a) they have found the balls necessary to commit a ship to certain death  in taking fights at a disadvantage  
---
b) the successful ones are demonstrably better in the way the understand this game's mechanics because they, well, prevail in circumstances lesser players will quickly die.   
---
so please, show us on the model where the loki tackled you and afterwards man up :)
---
I understand that, but a lack of some sort of free player mechanic would arguably be worse for player retention than what is currently set up.
---
It's 2019, and MMOs as a genre are doing poorly. There needs to be the thing that 'hooks' people into the game. You can argue that Alpha's need to be more limited, but broadly generalizing them all as useless freeloaders is a bad state of mind kinda.
---
If you got dropped to 40% structure their logi was asleep at the wheel. That is beyond ridiculous.
---
You always get ecvicted if anyone wants ;-)
---
You want pvp? look for corps in C2 : S C5 : S 0.0 like us
---
You want pve ? perhaps C3 : S 0.0 or any C4
---
You want dank isk? C5 or C6 with dank ships
---
Well trying to be honest here.    
---
English is not my primary language. 
---
I read the title ... and my first impression is - it is till the end of the month.       
---
I read the content, trying to not skip details ... ok it is not only for a month.         
---
^(apparently many people skipped some parts in the content)          
---
    
---
Like trying to be actually accurate with my assumptions here and showing where and why people can get wrong impression on the length.         
---
Literally yesterday guy jumped on the TS we use and asked what changed as he was not logging in since the blackout started ... and it was meant to end tomorrow.
---
WTM by the looks of it
---
We have TS/Discord ... those who care, are spammed by me }:&gt;      
---
Even if they don't want to.
---
Do you guys accept alpha account??
---
&gt;Due to game mechanics Red vs Blue is in Caldari FW.
---
What game mechanics?
---
The vast majority of gameplay is in frigates, destroyers, cruisers and battlecruisers. I would get rough skills for all factions to IV on these. Get all gun and missile skills on your pvp pilot to IV as well and then work on getting the small guns/missiles to t2 - it's fast and you will use them constantly.
---
So, work on the Magic 14 to level IV, then the small ship and gun skills. After that, I would work on armor and shield resistance skills to IV - almost every pvp fit will have some form of resistance enhancer.
---
If you only have 30-45 minutes to play you are likely to spend the entire time on the wait list to get in.
---
It's more than just cloaky ships. Fleets are again roaming. And the best part is we're now asking "where'd they go?" The element of surprise is what I like about this blackout. It's also more than just PvP... it makes the biggest pve isk grind no longer an easy experience. Null is about risk and defending the space the best you can. Eventually you'll see more alliances consolidating to be more effective.
---
You've stated what you **can** do, but not what you **want to** do. The latter is kinda important. r/evejobs is a pretty good resource.
---
Thats more often than not just bots. Atleast in tradehubs. They will just adapt.
---
We can be in same alliance and shoot each other.
---
my man
---
No they aren’t. Imperium and Legacy are temporary blue for strategic timers but otherwise are neutral.
---
Goons dunked a Legacy Titan last month - https://zkillboard.com/kill/77930067/
---
Possibly aggression/sec status in lowsec? Placid/Black Rise have more Galmil than Calmil, so it makes sense that they'd join the Caldari in order to get a bunch of free targets to shoot at on the Gallente side.
---
do you like trouble in terrorist town?
---
&gt;I Smartbombed My Alts Snake Pod 
---
FTFY
---
i clicked on this being confused about HOW do you smartbomb your OWN pod. not about how to accidentally friendly fire
---
Buy 20 bucks of Plex and be more ahead
---
most likely.
---
I plan on leaving them regardless
---
I think this touches on some of the concerns that I have as well...
---
&gt;However, without some sort of end goal or target, chaos in and of itself can be off-putting to a lot of players. Players want to understand the “rules of the game” and be able to plan and work within them. They don’t call it spreadsheets in space for nothing.
---
As a new(ish) player, it seems to me that what has happened in Eve was to be expected, and is in fact human nature.  Just as we can see in the evolution of humanity on Earth, we see it in New Eden as well:  Mankind has worked together to bring order to chaos, to develop efficient systems.  Maybe too efficient, sure.  But unless you're purely the hunter/killer type, to some degree that order and efficiency is necessary.  
---
Given that  a big part of the game is long-term planning, and so much time and effort is put into progression, sure we want some vision of the end game.  Spend a year training skills and billions of isk to get a certain ship, then suddenly it's nerfed to oblivion?  Yeah, perhaps it's always been that way, but the real question is - should it be that way?
---
 &gt;  I’m not opposed to changes to Asset Safety. It’s a powerful tool that can be used to avoid confrontation and even abused to move industrial assets around... Secondarily, there are many reasons people take a break from the game. Work, military deployment, illness, vacation, children, accidents, etc. ...
---
I was thinking on this one the other day.  Obviously it is a somewhat necessary mechanic in terms of player retention.  But it is too open to abuse.  I was thinking what if you made it an opt-in mechanic, sort of like insurance?  Basically, my thought was that instead of paying the asset safety fee only if needed, you have to pay it proactively like an insurance.  Works well if you you know something is coming up, like a deployment, a vacation, etc, and your "contract" expires every time you log into that account.  This could make it prohibitively expensive to overly abuse the system. 
---
 For those unknowns (like an accident) I guess that it's just one of the risks you'll have to take.  Maybe there's a better answer on that one, but I'm not sure of what it is.
---
If you can make the blame stick I'd say blame the other guy, being a known thief makes it harder to steal in the future
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum
---
Your fallacies only make my argument stronger.

Yes, but any chance we will ever see those suggestions* you gave ever being implemented? :D

I'd like to see the corp eat itself. I already got one innocent guy kicked. Good advice

---
Vibrant to me is more of an emotional response rather than a quantitative reality.  It's more about how you "feel".  Is it  possible a small amount of groups who haven't been having fun in Eve (like small gang players) are having a ball - but the larger groups are doing less?
---
I've played Eve 2-3 years ago and am now considering coming back. At the time, I was mostly doing solo exploration in nullsec and enjoying it. I was also mining, trading, and hauling and enjoyed doing various things.
---
I've talked to a friend and he might be interested in trying Eve again (he only did the free trial some years ago and didn't want to pay to keep playing). We'll be f2p to start. So I'm wondering what are good options for us to try as alpha clones to have fun and hopefully keep my friend playing. My friend would not enjoy "grinding" gameplay so I was thinking maybe something pve or pvp so that we can see some actions. Is there anything that we can do as a 2 players group? Last time I was playing I was considering to do Faction Warfare, is that a good option? Making ISK is not the priority, having fun is; but I am well aware that you need ISK for that.
---
Sorry we can’t all be hardass like you I guess
---
I think I lost brain cells reading this.
---
It Will take a while, because numbers are increasing, not droping. :P
---
it's also worth noting we spent a lot of effort cleaning out the botting corps that were subrenting from KWG.  I still want to see the "last year only" botting data that was promised but never delivered.
---
Can I ask what you think about login rewards has affected your login data?
---
Well Low sec is dried out of kills because fac war is dead. 1 fac war system siege used to create probably like 3k kills atleast in very short amount of time.
---
If you want to play it safe, it was an accident.
---
If you like drama, it was that guy.
---
If you want to boost your ego, it was you.
---
If you want to double your profit, send me your ISK.
---
Hey I'm looking to get back into Eve with a friend and wondering what we could do as alpha clones. I'm thinking PvE but don't know all the options. What are incursions and what do we need to get started?
---
I once combat scanned my own pod down and podded myself...no idea how that bug happened...but it never gave me a km
---
Yeah but then you'll realize you're too old to be grinding hours a day. Which is why I moved to eve in the first place!
---
You have to own structures now to declare war. Unless you're in FW for some reason.
---
They probably don't want to dick with structures.
---
Gotta remember that most likely the affected Corp leader will post here outing you.
---
Looks like you're already dead set on burning all the bridges with that corp so why not steal whatever you can get your hands on and move to some other corporation.
---
Is there a list of the suggestions submitted?
---
I saw some posts during the csm campaigns, but they were painful ways to dismantle FW posing as if to improve it like 'open sliding for gankers outside of ship class' ... WTF, the lie those were.
---
Last data they have, numbers were rising. :V
---
I solo hunt lol , on a Loki , stratios and Tengu but all I’m saying is it lots of time in the act of solo for very short content and definitely not warranted a superior complex lol
---
:Insert picachu face here:
---
rob co chcesz, ale kiedy zostawisz mnie w spokoju czlowieku?
---
Its pretty much the same right about now:)
---
or Wormholer? because the mole on this...erm, umm; Anyways Dany and Jon were doomed to unhappiness in the end, so...
---
All the recent changes with no roadmap has distracted me from caring.
---
It’s not the money people care about in null, but the lack of effort.
---
New players should not be on Null sec. And if they are, is their choice.
---
That being said. Who cry about local on Null are not new players, but old time krabbs, who get rich in Null systems safer than most of high sec... AND.... Botters.
---
Yikes the venom is real but I can’t exactly disagree. Chance is good at advertising his brand ( of course he is it’s his irl trade). However I think more credit should be given to the people who really helped him out in the beginning. 
---
There should be a place for more casual play as always but of course some bad habits and a high turnover is going to come with the territory. It is what it is at this point good or bad.
---
They introduced a wildly unpopular (at the time) system, and said they were collecting data on it. They then introduced rewards just for logging in. Omega accounts got more rewards. Of course it tainted the numbers.
---
Sounds like the problem is you honestly.
---
That’s true but when you don’t need to carry refits or whatever for your alliances doctrine the cost drops a bit. I think when I was looking at it the other day, you’re out about a bil. Which is a lot, but not really that much.
---
Mutual war overrides the new war mechanics installed. That means we don’t need structures to both be in FW and also continue the war against Red and Blue.
---
Or new independent blocks, giving a fresh air to Null... Or moving into low sec. Making new conflicts on their way  around best moons of low sec, LV5 hubs and best pockets.
---
Win-win
---
Yeah no good tutorials on how to do this.
---
4 years ago, when jump fatigue was introduced.
---
Theres no way they would be able to put 2 and 2 together until after
---
Beast created Texas law? Thought that was Mad Vemane?
---
For 1.5B it's not worth heisting.  That's not even 30 days of Plex on the market right now.
---
Take your learnings, get into a more valuable  alliance and take 1.5T - then do an AMA on Reddit like everyone else does.
---
Nothing was stopping me before either. Nothing was stopping you either.
---
I should ask for some extra isk as quick investments on my way out, good call.
---
Please don't bring local into null sec :(
---
No interest in hurting good people. The Corp I'm in is full of @*******
---
Additional addition: When I lived in a C3 with a HS static, attacks on my small group's citadel were about a once-a-month affair. Typically they'd be fleets of around 10 pilots in cruisers, battlecruisers, and battleships, but with some smart use of modules (and the occasional distraction ship undocking to "fight"), an Astrahus can pretty happily defend itself from a fleet of that size.
---
New players are not lasting longer than the old trial system. That is what the data shows. 
---
And any time you have folks getting something for free that others pay for, they are freeloading. So yes, the generalization is correct.
---
Maybe the logins isnt the data point they are looking at though? Maybe it's time logged in? Or time undocked in space? Or how many jumps traveled per session?
---
Oh then I can tell you only what I'd do, burn it down and cop to it - then mine the salt that comes your way  and enjoy.
---
I really have been out of it for a long time...
---
Ishtar for pve baits, domi for group rr, praxis for solo pvp, sabre for catching asteros and i think i forgot one
---
It might help to add more annotations, even if it's just calling to attention a number on the overview.
---
Eve University have a wormhole campus, based in a C2 with HS &amp; C3 statics, active in most time zones and regularly taking small gang PvP. Well established and a great place to learn the ropes until something harder comes knocking. Info is here, https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_Campus you can join the uni at any level as long as you have something you want to learn. I'm an Eve Uni Diplo and based in WHC.
---
You make a convincing argument
---
I second a C2-HS/C3
---
Easy logistics, PvE in the C3 static and plenty of C3s have null statics where you can roam for PvP.
---
That numbers are just bot accounts and the more extreme lazy krabs who want being able to make 400m/hour as they watch Netflix.
---
People who active play, are enjoing it. Making pings for minings op, gate camping, camp breaking, small/nano solo roaming.
---
EvE it's more alive now than the last few years all togheter.
---
I was orbiting at 7.5km of the landing point in a FW outpost and another ship landed 40kmish away from me. I thought the acceleration gate was the only way to join an FW outpost and always makes you land on the same point, but I guess I must be wrong?
---
Are you gonna let me fly my snakes now? Or i have to pop another of your stratios ;)
---
Can this fit be used for nuking.pods.amd shuttles at gates like the Proteus used to?
---
I used to love smartbombing pods in low sec with my prote, was relaxing, like fishing, in the jungle
---
\*shrugs\*
---
What can I say, my experience has been different, and that of the two friends I convinced to try the game out. Without it we wouldn't be here.
---
The automod bot is currently a little broken and not is not updating the OP to show the modified discord link.
---
The correct discord link is: https://discord.gg/tWeMAek or you can use the perma link: animeistrash.org/eve
---
100% blame the other guy. in this age of chaos we need agents of chaos. do your best to fan the flames.
---
People be hating on imperium because we take advantage of the current game mechanics
---
It's good for undock flexing, since it has like 3m+ EHP :\^)
---
I think this is because of trying to pump up login numbers to show that the blackout and other changes are causing more people to play and hide the number of people who have unsubbed.
---
Well, maybe Bob should pay attention and git gud or risk reducing his  and his groups chances of success?
---
??
---
Oh, I'm not wormholer. I'm totally a whormoler.
---
Dude, I'm just messing with you &lt;3
---
We said in the same article that the length of the blackout wasn't specified though, so there's plenty of time for it to continue.
---
You reached the point of denying his personal experiences just because you don't like them, your head is in your ass, pull it out.
---
Incursions are sites that pop up in constellations random across Eve. They are sites that require a fleet of people to run them. They range in needing 10-60 people depending on which one you are running. In high sec, the main dps ships have to be in battleships and the rest need to be logi or target painters. When my first corp did them in high sec, the alphas were given a thorax because if it orbited another ship, the enemy couldn’t hit it very well. 
---
In nullsec incursions, you can use carriers, supers, and even titans as well but can still be run in battleships. In nullblocs that run incursions, alphas are welcome and they usually have fits for those types of players. They make 10-30 mil a site and the faster you run them, the more money to be had
---
Who said my goal was to kill bots? My aim was to get no consensual PvP against other human players but almost every system I went to that showed activity was full of BOTS.
---
That depends my dude - solo hunting, while a branch of the solo pvp thing, is just another method. There are people who actually fight, not gank, and those are deserving of respect. 
---
Props for going solo, try a non-cloaky ship sometimes, it won't hurt to lose some :)
---
Remove all local.
---
how the fuck does it effect the big guy? they're more likely to afford the asset safety than the smaller guy, not to mention asset safety isn't free in the first place you still have to pay to retrieve shit from safety
---
alright thanks, one of my corp mates suggested a scan probe launcher fit so that's totally an option
---
So i have -9.8 standing with gallente, what do?
---
Well it would be based on volume in a station so if you have 200 titans in a station you will be paying a fee to house them there.
---
well i dont really have the resources to get into jump freighters or frieghters anytime soon, so i might stay away from nullsec for the time being, i might just use high-null or high-low routes
---
What data would that be?
---
They were, for instance, looking at MAU/DAU which they stated themselves. That is affected by login rewards. This can also be applied to every other form of activity. If you give incentives to log in everything will be affected, you simply cant get around it and accounting for its effects are impossible.
---
Then they should actually tell people that some of these experiments are meant to fix the real issues. Instead they just went on a "hate NS rant" instead of atleast trying to remain objective. And it certainly doesnt help when their customer relations guy constantly airs his subjective thoughts filled with disdain towards a certain group.
---
So you are correct, they talked about how they are gonna fix the problems, but the only premise was/is that NS is the problem. And the solution is to burn it to the ground.
---
to be fair the ceptor did die?
---
thanks for the advice, im thinking they might be usefull for wormholes as wel
---
Never not have probes .
---
that's actually pretty cool, i might try that
---
Incursions are high-end battleship PvE content. You'll need to have good skills and a fair amount of ISK to get started. You can find some example fits on the [EVE Uni page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Incursion_Fitting:_Vanguard) for the lowest-difficulty level of incursions to give you an idea of what you'd be looking at. Incursions require small fleets of battleships with a few logistics cruisers to keep up with the damage. You would most likely end up joining a public incursion fleet, for which the fleet commander would hand out orders as to which rats to shoot at in which order (because that can be important). If you don't have those kinds of skills yet but still want to do PvE, I'd suggest starting with some missions either solo or together with your friend, or searching for, scanning down, and running DED sites, which can drop some pretty shiny loot!
---
thanks
---
No, period.
---
EvE had it's peak online back in times when people outside of game were rumoring it's hardcore nature. It was believed that EvE is a rogue-like MMO and losing your pod is a big deal. And later on, without an apparent reason medical clones were removed AND skill injectors were introduced. Both things made your skill points worth way less than before, causing less drama and less effort to survive in EvE.
---
Removing attributes is just another move toward casual EvE, where any of your actions are not worth any consequences. 
---
I have a better idea - let's return medical clones and make people lose all their SP if they don't pay for it. I promise newbros will get happy when all old palyers just lose all their SP in a big fight
---
Actually they were PL's stations in Providence. Is your selective amnesia kicking in again?
---
So. Hi sec isnt isk worth for you. And Low SEC is too dangerous.
---
So lets krabb a shittong of isk in Null as we are afk and have an external app that alert us about a non blue on local 14 jumps away. YAY!!!!
---
NO!.
---
a lot of my corp mates were like "dont use cyno" but i thought once i make some connections i probably should
---
Oh I see. Sorry I misunderstood
---
[Here you go friend](https://i.imgur.com/jHtwZbo.png)
---
Detroit has a higher Industrial Index.
---
well thanks, im trying to use a lot of the resources that i have, but just dont use normally to get friendly with big people
---
i think wormhole is probably going to be my go to hauling, do you know anyone in wh space that i could talk to?
---
So you saying that the one poop turd (harbouring excessive botting covering 2 full regions with literally every single system for 3 years) battling the other poop turd (whose leader RMTed and that run many bots too) is better and in fact some mousse-au-chocolat?
---
Mmh maybe Iepatan?
---
augs are generally bad yeah cuz they are pretty weak in HP for the price and split dps is generally trash especially at higher abys tiers. at low tiers it may not matter cuz the resist debuff isnt so much. in darks augmenteds are good cuz split doesnt matter
---
geckos are always op tho cuz of extra tracking and hp if u use an ishtar (protip: shield ishtar op)
---
Simple insurance based off of M3 or asset value works probably the best. Anything not insured will have a chance to drop. This will allow the costs of asset safety to scale accordingly. 
---
There will be no perfect solution. No need to make it over complicated either.
---
Here a better panda https://i.imgur.com/DV6ErsW.jpg
---
No wormhole is safe from eviction. Remember that. Only bring what you need into the wormhole. Consider everything in the wormhole lost the moment you bring it in.   
---
C2 with a High Sec/Low sec static is a bad idea. Don't fall for a false security. Sure it's always nice to have a way out to Kspace, but you will get constant traffic from high sec noobs and people will constantly be shooting your structures. Not to mention, If someone does want to evict you, they will always have an easy way in. Don't go for the High sec statics. Just don't do it. Look for a C4 with C3/C2 statics. Sure you will have to scan a little more to get out or roll a couple holes to get out. But in the end it's better.
---
Research how to do wormhole things. Knowing how to roll holes, d/probe scan are big ones. Make a ton of scan alt accounts. You will at some point be podded out of your hole. Always have a way to scan yourself back in. Also make a few Rolling alt accounts. You will lose rolling ships left and right. Always good to have backup's. Make sure to stock your station full of rolling battleships.  
---
Learn what fits to use for the statics you get. For C3/C4 combat sites, Cheap RnR domi's work really well.
---
Right but then they come here and out you as a con man thus making your life a bit tricky in eve going forward
---
While I realise that not everyone will have the same experience of being part of WiNGSPAN, I don't recognize some of the criticism you have. I'd like to offer a different perspective on what you pointed out.
---
* While it's true that Chance doesn't log on as much, it doesn't disqualify him as leadership. Just because you don't see him online doesn't mean he is not involved. 
---
* While there are pilots in WiNGSPAN that like to bling their ships (to the level of "stupid") this is by no means exclusive to this corp. If anything, the lack of a doctrine might be more likely a cause than anything else. I personally fly a few of the stupid fits, but do so because I enjoy it, not because shinier = better.
---
* Delivery receipts are and have always been optional as well as any other role-playing aspects (even says so on the part of the websites where you applied for the corp). While some members are more anally retentive to the receipts it's not enforced, nor have I ever seen anyone been berated for it. I've seen more customers complain about not receiving one than I've seen delivery agents gripe about it.
---
* As previously stated, there's no doctrine so people can fly whatever they want. Of course, "bringing your drake" doesn't work in most situations (although we've had drake fleets in the past), but anything suitable for the situation is typically accepted. There are enough folks flying (cheap) stealth bombers, interdictors or triglavian hulls. Just check zkill for proof. 
---
* In general, no one gets upset if you have kills outside of w-space. However, the MO of the corporation is finding content in wormhole space using primarily covert ops ships. To those players who were fully disconnected from that play style the question was put: why did you join this corporation in the first place? So, yes, if you spend all your time in Amarr ganking at the undock, perhaps WiNGSPAN wasn't the most logical choice. :)
---
* There are plenty of long-time pilots that fly or have flown with Bombers Bar (myself included). No shits were ever given. 
---
* WiNGSPAN has a general "don't be a dick" rule. Customer Service V counts towards customers as well as fellow pilots. With so many pilots there are likely to be pilots you don't get along with. However, starting shit or drama in corp is not tolerated from anyone. I've been a recruiter long enough to have seen it enforced several times.
---
* Since everyone that find content is the default FC (unless he defers) there's likely going to be plenty of folks that will fuck up or not know about things such as comm discipline.
---
WiNGSPAN is definitely not for everyone. If you care a lot about killboards, doctrines, comm discipline and are not very tolerant other people's flaws or mistakes, this corp is not for you. If you'd rather hang around on some station undock racking up easy kills, or do Incursions WiNGSPAN isn't for you. If you get annoyed with people who in your opinion are wasting their time and money doing stuff they think is fun, WiNGSPAN isn't for you.
---
If you care more about fun than your killboard, can thrive in an organic, non-structured environment and have a live-and-let live attitude towards your fellow agents you can go a long way in this corp.
---
trust me, i horde them for fun
---
Realistically, you can’t usually solo someone if they are in a group. Maybe try a Hecate if they are in small stuff, you can kill anything t1 cruiser and down (as long as it isn’t dualprop or neut fit) pretty quickly so you might be able to get a kill and run away before their backup arrives.
---
ypou go by hours not runs. t3 about 100m, t4 about 200, t5 about 300. 
---
idk about t2 but id guess 50m hour at best, probably a bit less
---
well except local
---
You're on fire today, sir.
---
1.5 bil is def not worth the reputation scarring. I can make 1.5 bill in less than a handful of DED sites or a few T5 abyssals. A week of mission running can make that with LP.
---
Don’t do it. That’s just lame especially if it’s your main.
---
Having filters, and properly using them are not a given.
---
Example: I can start Quickbooks right now that has all manner of filters and a database of transactions. I can use those filters and sort however I want. Including using my own data to obscure results I do not want to see/show. Obfuscation and manipulation of data is common. Not interpreting data properly is also common.
---
Yeah, once I smartbombed my tengu alt char. Doing sites with my archon...
---
we have at least 3 keepstars in 1dq, trust me we can more than afford to split it all up and still be in the same system. This would change nothing for us who are able to afford nice things and would just cost more for the budding alliance. It's almost like none of you give two seconds of thought before shitting out ideas, you'd fit in with CCP come to think of it.
---
fix fireworks fitting reqs to 0 and ill take him out for you
---
I think we have more then that
---
He doesn’t lock the pod but the ship to ensure not missing the brief moment between poof and warp.
---
CCP's new stuff rolls in. CCP's new stuff rolls out. Can't explain that.
---
I couldnt go back to pre blackout, I ll just unsub or put all my accounts into afk myrms with a 3rd party tool to help instadock them when content comes around until ccp adds it again.
---
&gt; we can more than afford
---
The goal is not collapsing your alliance. It's creating an ISK sink. If you can afford the sink, then we're gucci.
---
How to select one item in a stack or half of the items in a stack? This is driving me crazy
---
You are a morron or just pretending to be one?
---
If you want no local there’s wormholes for that. Oh wait, oops. Wormholes are now safer than nullsec. Hmm.
---
Turn nullsec into a bloodbath, loot piñatas everywhere. Let the big groups fight each other to death.
---
[Yeah I suggested this and reddit didn't like it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cei6al/hot_take_blackout_should_become_permanent_and/eu39izl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Also acceptable
---
I interpreted "stations" as "stations" and not "structures" which I'm totally cool with.
---
Well, so can scientists, yet they exert immense control over variables. Almost as if they know something.
---
Nice manipulated view, letting out all totals and thus leaving no hard data on increase/decrease in actual percent of totals. Also completely leaving out the "must be" connected data on logged in accounts versus accounts per player ...
---
just an example:
---
The increase in kills from 2017 -&gt; 2018 is a total of 3.15%
---
The decrease in kills from 2018 -&gt; 2019 is a total  of 7.1%
---
Taken into account the decline in logged in accounts since 2016 by over 30% while at same time avg. accounts per player have dramatically risen, these numbers dont't look that negative to me. For a final evaluation you have to collect at least 2 years of further data ....
---
This is yet another example of ccp solving a perceived problem without correctly framing it or understanding all the potential misuse and abuse or even what could be the intent of this mechanic.  
---
Asset safety is intended (from near as I can tell) to be a player retention/reacquisition mechanic that works to ensure players still have the ingame assets they may had developed a sentimental attachment for.  Players who afk for some period of time for reasons beyond their control won’t see all those hours of progress completely wiped should the game evolve within the regions of space where they were active.  
---
It’s not intended to be abused for stashing assets for a quick portal to low sec.  or intended to be used to provide for the safety net of structure death.  
---
I can’t see why a simple timer on withdrawal from safety (at current cost of 15%) after some length of time from last login or omega status expiry doesn’t absolutely solve the problems.  Oh and also make it so they can’t just swap assets to another player structure.  Make asset safety always move the items to low sec.  and irretrievable for 90 days from last login.  If you want them inside the 90 days you pay more.  
---
Null is supposed to be dangerous right?  If you’re a little guy Corp and can’t defend your space you’re gonna pay rent or ransoms to not have them blown up or you’re gonna move.  Losing shit will hurt.  
---
But if you afk for irl reasons or whatever and want to come back you can have access to your stuff at minimum hassle and pain.
---
that would be hilarious, still wouldn't meet what OP thinks it would, poor olmeca and co all those dreads they'd have to pay extra for
---
I would suggest a fee each day per m3 of 10 mill isk. asset  you can't pay for getting destroyed so it acts as an mineral sink and isk sink
---
Eh fuego!
---
Just an offer, make of it what you will.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
I moved into a C2-HS/C3 just over a month a go. Was my first solo experience and has been fun. I allowed another user who wanted to jump into wormhole space for the first time into "my" hole. He has his own structure and does his own thing(s). If you'd like to move in, let me know. All I ask is you help defend structures should the need arise. No obligations to me, just drop a citadel and have fun
---
I have completely ignored this.  What a joke
---
To my mind, capital ships (including freighters) are the only assets you legitimately need more than one account for.  Being able to light your own cynos and scout/web your own freighter are huge parts of being successful in those ships.
---
Otherwise it's perfectly plausible to run a single account. Though if you become a pirate, you'll need to roll at least one additional toon to go to the trade guns for supplies, but that could be on the same account as you wouldn't necessarily need to run both characters at the same time.
---
shift-drag
---
RNG triggers emotions triggers you coming back. You know that 50k payout will happen tomorrow right?
---
Exploration is still a great way of making ISK without much up-front investment.
---
ove only gotten 1x rat also feels bad being a new player
---
Don't be a dick, your clearly making things sound worse than they probably are because you need the permission your clearly seeking from reddit, which tells us a lot about you as a person.
---
Don't be that guy. just leave the corp tell them its not working out and find better people.
---
I love you
---
Lmao at all the nullbear f1 pushers crying anout fairness. Why dont you go to hi sec where you belong, dont forget to bring your mining permit.
---
Lol... what's a morron? So much irony.
---
~~Cocaine~~ Skillpoints are one hell of a drug.
---
np
---
Oh ya totally respect it ,  don’t get me wrong, 
---
Especially those who are just bad ass pilots have lots of experience doing it.
---
My Corp has a few guys that that’s all they do and there extremely good at it.
---
But they don’t bash the Pve players or hate on them or look down on them , that’s the issue I’m trying to address. 
---
For whatever reason some pvp players think them self better then the pve players and while they might be better pilots that doesn’t necessarily means there better players in Eve.
---
Maybe it's jumps, I roamed an hour yesterday and didn't see a soul, and didn't see any action. According to a jump metric I was Super Active! Couple that with the bombing of excavators, and we got all kinds of activity! Jumps, kill-mails generated, oh my! Meanwhile the reality was boring AF. Low quality content is content none the less.
---
Thanks for the info! So I guess we won't start with invasions. When you suggest to run missions, you're talking of the NPC/agents missions?
---
What about Faction Warfare, is this possible to do solo/duo or you have to be in fleet as well?
---
Oh I understand all I need to based off your name and posting history.
---
Maybuh I missed it but a mapping tool is pretty essential. I've used tripwire for years but there's also pathfinder, siggy and others. Google them, pick one and set your Corp mask up so everyone can see, update and add to your chain.
---
Just keep praying to RNGeesus
---
Who cares? Address his point. Yes, we can afford it in spades. The little guys not so much. Congrats to Hilmar for screwing the little guy? It's a drop inn the bucket for Imperium or Legacy to shit out more Keepstars. You want more Keepstars? Ok, then. Easy. They're cheap. Almost every change in this age of 'chaos' can easily be absorbed or solved by the handful of large-block alliances, which have already turtled up under supercap umbrellas. That's the part everyone's missing. And no, none of us *really* want to fight each other in a timezone-tanked slog through thousands of citadels and Fozzie sov cancer, so we'll just all hang out with our trillions and citadel spam, and watch the world burn and laugh all the way to the bank.
---
Given the value of sp, 10k is more than enough to do it each day.
---
Something kind of similar happened to me many years ago. I was floating around some corpmates who were running some C4 sites in our static, and I was getting some nice screen shots of all the ships, and I was in a little Helios. Well, they all pulsed their smartbombs to frag the small ships and I was podded on the spot with a full Virtue set. They didn't know I was there, and I was busy talking with someone on comms about something else that I never told them what I was doing either. We all had a good laugh about it.
---
If you are an Alpha, it doesn't matter how long you stick around, you are deadweight.
---
Just gonna keep 4-4'ing like always.

&gt; Leak in Thukker Mix Reveals Next Gen City Ships
---
&gt;EZA-FM IV – Leisure Group publication Eagle's View published extensive documentation and video evidence of a major Thukker city ship project, late last night. The anonymously sourced evidence confirms suspicions that Thukker Mix and Core Complexion are collaborating on the construction of new city ships using technology recovered from several expeditions into the Rogue Drones regions. The source, claiming to be an engineer, says their leak was motivated by concern about the poorly-understood technology, which has a record of behaving unpredictably.
---
&gt;Timestamps on the digital documents date the start of the project in YC111, though research missions in the Rogue Drone region had apparently been ongoing for several years prior. Construction is stated to have commenced in several Great Wildlands deadspace pockets during YC114. Eagle's View has told the Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx that their investigation into the ultimate disposition of the "city ships project" is continuing.
---
I am saying that instant teleport is an overpowered mechanic that is killing the game.
---
&gt;Give us the advantage to kill stuff without any form of counter. Thats already mostly what the blackout is about, you want even more advantage?
---
It is not clear what you mean. Why should the largest ships also be the fastest?
---
&gt;"Prevent more fights", are you high? Stop with this narrative. You dont get more fights when no one is around to fight, you get that right?
---
You cant fight anything because there is always a cyno with caps as backup.
---
&gt; I want the elite pvpers to get their every wet dream. Cause it will take about 1-2 weeks for the entire game to break after that. 
---
Yeah, imagine being able to trust that what you see on dscan is actually what you will be fighting instead of 1 ship with cyno + 50 caps on standby.
---
&gt;So when Eve is dead, atleast then the idiots might understand that they are in fact, idiots.
---
People like you killed it.
---
Excellent and accurate post Coyote. I'm glad I didn't take that first real Eve break now.
---
OHHH NOOOOOO YOURE MISSING OUT OH MAN TIME TO WRITE A TEN PAGE THESIS
---
Cavalry Fortizar doctrine when?
---
Having more stations would not matter it could be a straight m3 fee no matter where you store it. The big issue is that there is no sink to owning more and that is just not realistic. The fee could even come in the form of fuel cost. Got more m3 in a station or system it takes more fuel for your structures. Let the corps sort out how it’s paid.
---
As far as missions go, yes, I am referring to NPC agent missions. If you haven't already done it, the Sisters of EVE epic arc is a good starting point! You can access that through the agency window.
---
Faction warfare is totally doable solo, but you will encounter PvP action while doing FW, and you might find it helpful to be in a fleet (or duo) so that you have some support in the event you get into a fight you can't win alone!
---
I honestly cant figure out what data would remain untainted after the login events. They are behaviour changing events and trying to determine how much behaviour they changed (to be able to exlude their effects) during a massive change is impossible which means all data gets tainted, on both events.
---
I haven't played in a few years and am now thinking about coming back, but I'd like to know about ships and modules that were added since I left (around when T3 destroyers were released) first. Is there any good resource online where I can browse this stuff (I have no idea how to navigate the official patchnotes btw)?
---
Tell that to searbhreathach
---
I'm 100% certain that the break-even point for this game is sustained by all the various alts people with 'sunk cost fallicy' have funded. You don't need a large player base if your average user pays for 3 or more accounts. So long as you can have that required number of accounts being paid for, the game is sustainable.
---
But if Black Pearl Abyss demands 'growth or bust'. then off goes the servers. You nerds have only kept the wheel spinning with your addiction to this game.
---
I guess that's subjective considering we've had our best content ever.
---
They've already whelped it at this rate
---
Ya he answers all eve mails. Will definitely help.  He will even log in and teach some better fittings
---
You think I can write a thesis of more than 1 page? You think I went to any venue of higher education? You buffoon. **Buffoon I tell you!**
---
You guys can do better than this for creating isk drains.  Come on.  
---
How bout Titan ship skill book cost increases?
---
They’re doing market tax increases.  
---
Is there zero creativity left in the tank?
---
You get downvoted for saying something reasonable. Its quite laughable actually. I would imagine a delay of the jump cloak time to be okey. If you break cloak you show up in local. Thats more than enough time to catch bots but not enough to catch attentive players.
---
Spectrum, USA
---
Or how about no more free repairs in citadels....
---
Ain't that the truth!
---
&gt; Yes, we can afford it in spades. 
---
Cool, nice sink.
---
&gt; The little guys not so much. 
---
They don't stack 1000 titans in a station.
---
&gt;Yes, we can afford it in spades. The little guys not so much. Congrats to Hilmar for screwing the little guy?
---
Unironically quoting myself.
---
thats hilarious dato, ive definitely done similar things to my own pods b4, im still trying to krab up a new snake set &gt;.&lt;
---
In your situation I would suggest skilling into cruisers, specifically the gila but also beyond that. 
---
Cruisers are relatively fast to train into and are good for abyssal sites and mission running. Importantly, having those skills also gives you ther option of participating in pvp when you want/need. Most pvp in Eve is with cruisers and down, rarely with battleships (though it does happen). Excluding nullbloc capital spam, anyway.
---
7 days of 10k rewards. My results are starting to really push the left end of the bell curve for "random".
---
I mean.. fuck me for saying something honest right? Also, downvotes.. really? I can go post a cat picture in another sub and get 50000 karma. People here are really wrapped up in their own perceived importance.
---
TAXATION IS THEFT
---
Good stuff. 9000% agree on the asset safety point. People who think this would do anything are simply not aware of the game around them.
---
It's absolutely trivial for any decently run (and I use this loosely) alliance to create their own mock asset safety with basic logistics.
---
The lack of asset safety only punishes people for having lives, and also disproportionately dicks on new players.... who get goaded from Week 1 to "move to nullsec", do so, and then risk having their entire asset pool deleted over a weekend by invaders-du-jour.
---
Removal of asset safety is NOT a content driver. People see it in wormholes and they mid-understand the causes. It works in Wormholes because you CAN'T just JF everything out overnight.
---
One whole corp. Wow, thats gotta mean tons dude. And they are in a WH, no one is talking about them.
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/c/corporations-alliances/recruitment-center
---
You can also use the eve forum recruitment center too
---
I didn't propose this idea nor I am necessarily supporting it. Hilmar doesn't go through CSM before spitballing ideas. 
---
I'm just correcting bad linemember logic, as I've been doing last 3 years.
---
Skills. Looooooooooooooool. I didnt know skills allowed you to see cloaky ships on d-scan.
---
You're getting downvoted but the mechanics of 1 ISK trading are mind numbing. Imagine if you were only able to post priced that were at least one PERCENT cheaper than the lowest price.
---
You want people doing stuff in Delve to pay taxes.
---
He/Hilmar proposes people stashing 1000 titans in 1DQ to pay taxes.
---
No, you didn't suggest it.
---
Don't worry, a friend told me that we all supposedly get the same amount in the end.
---
**I'm pressing X though.** *(Unless I only get 50k ones for a whole week, maybe)*
---
"bad linemember logic" lmao, fuck off you squeaky voiced manchild
---
Ok, finally a question in my area of expertise.
---
You have to ask yourself if there is some looming potential for further shenanigans after your heist. Do you think you can get roles and steal more stuff? It might be worth sticking around a little while longer in that case. 
---
Is friendly fire legal? Then heist the stuff and go on a killing spree - terrorize them until you get kicked or the content dries up.
---
Are they war eligible? Dec them with an alt and farm them for kills until the content dries up.
---
Neither of the above but they have some expensive ships you want to kill anyway? Lure them into a wormhole. "Gee golly, these sleepers are tougher than I thought? Can you help me out with this site, Guy-Who-Runs-Missions-in-Something-Blingy? Gosh I'm such a helpless noob Don't worry there's nobody in here." Then kill/ransom.
---
Just don't fall into the trap of staying forever in some shitty corp because you want to "pull the long con". It will bore you to death. Get in, create as much chaos and despair as you can in a few days, maybe 2 weeks maximum, then get out and move on with your life.
---
Hop in the Belligerent Undesirables channel if you want help/advice from experienced veteran scumbag pirates. Its quiet these days but a few of us still lurk there.
---
&gt; He/Hilmar proposes people stashing 1000 titans in 1DQ to pay taxes.
---
I'm paying billions in corp office taxes mate. I can afford a couple more. Let's go for a mass or volume-based tax in stations and citadels.
---
I was expecting high grade. Still interesting story time tho
---
The best part is.that you missed
---
Lol, thats true.
---
I’m just saying if the intent as you said is to create an isk drain I feel like that’s not the most effective way to do so.  Creating an isk drain with regard to asset storage could be charging a player hangar space based on the m3 consumed.  So your get like some amount of space free but over some amount is charged.  
---
How asset safety is being abused is by active players using structures  they don’t have docking rights to move items without risk or it’s creating a sense of apathy towards structure deaths.
---
It means we are all in the dark. The dev's included.
---
True, if you aim low enough you will be disappointed less.
---
Nah how about no complex ?
---
I think you are missing the point. If you store one titan in your structure you pay per m3 to store that item that means one titan is 155000000m3 a small Corp could store 344 mauraders for the same cost as your one titan. The hoarding of capitals is one of the biggest issues with eve right now and it’s high time that something is done about it.
---
Its always worth heisting any amount of isk if you don't intend to continue playing in that corp. Reputation doesn't really follow you in this game like some people think it does. Take it from an experienced asshole.
---
Watch out! Boosters =/= accelerators!
---
It's debatable that accelerators benefit high SP pilots more than the newer ones (learning drone V is more usefull, than lvl4 in racial BS, but of course there is bio V...)
---
Boosters are a good idea. Consumable, with short effect spam, therefore large volumes would be traded at markethubs, thus better ISK sinks through tax/broker fee. Agency boosters, antipharmacons could be seeded through LP-stores. The new player part: they are not so complex to use, at least right-click+consuming Crash mid fight isn't more difficult then overheating. (inb4 bio-V, expense)
---
New modules- Pretty much any racial related module have a faction version in LP-stores.
---
Implants- Soon^(TM)
---
Personally i would also like a bit more variety. We could brainstorm pages here... But mostly boosters, and faction modules/consumables.   
---
(PS.: Modules beside the attribute increase, various OH effect would be fun: projectile-tracking, laser-damage, missile-explosion radius or speed, hybrid the rate of fire increase is fine here)
---
Local never stopped me. And Im not even good at PvP. There were plenty of interesting ways to catch people before. Now its simply a no contest. But then again, Im not a ganker, I like the thrill of a fight.
---
Naw the price would scale to the point of fairness forcing players to think about storage fees before the choose to have 20 titans.
---
A rentable player hangar for stuff would help with Titan arms controls.
---
Yeah, ewar is overpowered.
---
I mean, TAPI brain and all but he’s not wrong. FRT is proper cancer to the game. 
---
https://youtu.be/_cX6adQznEE the owners of the most widely used botting software in the game use FRAT toons to do so and even in tutorial videos show off FRT toons (this account is still not banned btw), also in the discord’s they use they give a tutorial telling you to join a certain Corp in iron crown(Frats Renters)/Frat and also have setups for specific systems in Detroid. Funny thing is, they don’t have pre existing setups for anywhere else but Detroid, so there must be such a demand for them in this area that it was brought into effect.
---
Easier to just join the caldari side.
---
Nah was an error was trying to reply to someone but realized I was in comments section a little too late there.
---
Yeah I don’t know what that was supposed to mean.  Seems he’s high today.  Well more than usual that is
---
 not sure what fucking quote thats from because it wasnt me who said that, are you getting confused between all the arguments youre having with other people?
---
Classy dude classy.
---
It might be fun to model this as I expect if we said 1isk per m3 a month everywhere in space the amount of isk that would drain from the huge alliances would be staggering compared to some of the small operations. Considering one titan is the same m3 as 344 marauders....
---
The VNI is total shit now at least. Reminds me of CCP.
---
You are saying a lot of shit in general. Its so very clear you dont understand any of these things and you are just parroting what the hivemind is saying. Which is stupid.
---
Ye imagine being able to fking trust dscan to not have 50 fking cloaky ships behind you. That would be fking awesome. But I cant longer know if 50 are in system can I? Or how many more they can bring in right? But that part is okey, the part with me being able to get assistance is what bothers you.
---
You are clearly just a griefer type dude, you only want safe kills. The worst kind honestly, just go join CODE and stfu about things you dont understand.
---
Uh Thukker NPC station in drone lands?       
---
I can live with that.
---
&gt;Asset safety is intended (from near as I can tell) to be a player retention/reacquisition mechanic
---
It's also to give feature parity to conquerable stations and outposts.  If your alliance lost one of those, your stuff remained in your hangar despite the new, hostile ownership.
---
Getting it out required a remote contract firesale or remote courier contract.  (Despite r/Eve's believe that said assets were stuck *forever*)
---
Poor little bot
---
wow you’re pretty dumb to say the amazing new vni is shit
---
already underrated comment
---
Lol ye I mean its fked up to say the least. People cant even handle discussions, its all about silencing the other side and doubling down even when its clear something is wrong.
---
meh 
---
BUY 👏 MORE 👏 SKINS
---
This I am talking about all structures citadel storage fee should be paid by the owner so that the owner can set market value rates to its “customers” if a goons or test wants to offer free storage to thier deep null carebear hoarder members that should be their choice.
---
and?
---
Came here to say this
---
No bittervets are opposed to every change no matter how good/bad it is. So by definition i can't be a bittervet in the context of this thread.
---
This would work well if capital skills degraded over time so you had to purchase new skills every so often.
---
Yeah well if they said only one KS per system now we’re getting somewhere.  
---
One KS per system.  
---
Players are required to rent hangars.  Failure to pay rent would have to be addressed... do the titans go into asset safety?  Ejected?  Transferred to the holding Corp of the station?  
---
Item Hangar rent is m3 based on items capped at some amount.  
---
Ship hangers are m3 as well and scales.  First 5m m3 is xxx,xxx... next 5m is xxx,xxx x3.  Whatever. 
---
Structures cap out in total.  Station managers can see who’s consuming space.  
---
Wouldn’t this have the effect also of spreading out player activity rather than the current turtled up in one system?
---
The people who have multiple titans can afford it. I have one guy in my corp who has two titans and is getting four - one for every racial. Trust me, with the 380b he has in his wallet, he literally doesn't care.
---
Drifters definitely caused a ~10 day pause in the TEST Frat war as we tried to figure out how much had to redeployed to home defense.
---
&gt; I’m just saying if the intent as you said is to create an isk drain I feel like that’s not the most effective way to do so.
---
This might as well be true. You see, my point is more nuanced.
---
"We can afford it" is a straight brain dead argument AGAINST an ISK sink proposal. That's all I said. Then you read into my post and assumed I am supporting Hilmars specific idea.
---
What is the mystery? MCT is a whale item.
---
Here is a nice Venture Beat column if your not sure what a whale is.[https://venturebeat.com/2013/03/14/whales-and-why-social-gamers-are-just-gamers/](https://venturebeat.com/2013/03/14/whales-and-why-social-gamers-are-just-gamers/)
---
mfw you could actually get 3 months of MCT for 1€ like 2 weeks ago.
---
For me was "Starting from". But if Even some native speakers got it wrong, it's understable the error.
---
Being ambiguous was intentional. I give them room to end it up or continue as they please.
---
If i said. Duración of... And later choose to make it permanent. The amount of salt would be evenhigher than now. Ambiguity gave them room to maniobrate around reactions.
---
What if it cost 155m per month to store them? If he can afford it great he still would be dumping 620m isk out of the system to have them that would be great!
---
&gt;with even admissions of its rather neglected status as of the last several years.
---
They have had the ability to "fix" it whenever they wanted for quite some time. The only real change is how dead it is these days, but that is to be expected.
---
&gt;For more than 3 months, the FW Committee Discord has started a conversation about FW with the explicit goal of advancing the cause of FW and presenting to CCP measures and actions that could help the zone flourish.
---
Whats wrong with reddit?
---
As others mentioned before: Magic14
---
Solid start for fitting ships and better defensive skills/navigation.
---
Start with some smaller ships for WH´s.
---
Great reply. I appreciate it. I disagree with you a bit here and there, but overall, you mounted a superb defense of Wingspan. 
---
Ultimately, Wingspan wasn't the corp for me. It's that simple. Thanks.
---
I can fly gila on 1 acc , on other im close. 
---
Think i will skill magic 14 and then into cruiser
---
Well i remember at least an avg. of 10k more logged in accounts in 2009, Nullsec had roaming gangs kindly visiting their neighbours every day (2008/09 saw me in Providence, Fountain and CloudRing).
---
And lowsec wasn't yet rofl-stomped by PL-Supers, as Dominion wasnt live yet ...
---
As much as the MAU/DAU. But one is okey to use but not the other?
---
This is the exact issue that needs to be addressed. A titan should need to be a choice that if not managed correctly could sink a Corp.
---
&gt;Fight the real enemy
---
local?
---
Right I’m just saying maybe it’s something to curtail it a bit.  Maybe it doesn’t charge below what 1 Titan is.  Idk.
---
This man is delusional. Take him to the infirmary.
---
Sure, login rewards, PLEX sale, 3 month MCT deal, Season of Skilling....
---
Once those all end we'll see what the real #'s look like
---
we create multitudes of wealth more than the small alliance so 1 ism per m3 is still a larger amount to small groups than us, youre comparing trillions made a month to a handful of billions made a month, and then anyone making moves to catch up with the largest of groups is going to get stung extra hard, meaning less  and less mid size alliances too
---
We will vote you in next election.
---
#Falcon4GameDesigner!
---
Sure maybe there is a cap that every player should be able to store 155million m3 then there is a charge for all storage after that. Want to store one titan for free sell everything else in space. I like it
---
I just subbed an additional account (4 now, all CC subbed with cash, never plexxed since 2007), and used the PLEX sale to get me some sweet ISK for cash, so I have more time being either the guy with the cam or the guy with the clubber XD
---
&gt;0.75% to 1.5% (sample numbers) total reduction over Jita
---
No one is going to bother shopping anywhere other than Jita for such a low savings.
---
You'd need something on the order of 20% or more.
---
You didn't see the taxes because they're not there.
---
It's human nature for a 'collective'' to gather together for safety. No matter what happens, that's what we do. Those who already built their sand castles are going to double down, because they can afford it.
---
I agree but right now you create that wealth at the same cost for smaller guys to create far less.
---
What if... it increased exponentially and not linearly...  155/450/1.1b/3b.  Per month.  
---
Mr 400b wallet starts to feel that after a while
---
this would also be lame because it fucks with the dude that does the seeding of markets and the like, deployments would be rarer and rarer as the individual wont want to bring all the doctrines up and he will be paying through the nose to just have the ships ready to go. a knock on effect would be more stagnation, rather than people sizing down.
---
Did the ship land or decloak? You can't cloak within 30km of the marker.
---
Who cares what they have to say as long as it has a goddamned advanced search function?
---
Removing asset protection means no other corps but large ones.
---
Or a subsystem skill for Titan modules like the DD.
---
not worth of time ;-)
---
No, just because a skill affects something, it doesn't mean the effect it big enough to bother.
---
So it already has a fanboi.
---
The difference is I actually looked into it. What are you gonna do with those guns? Rails? No, you cant hit shit and fitting issues. Blasters? Fitting issues and you gonna brawl? Just wait for the cyno. You sure as hell wont be catching anything small.
---
MMDS is leaving on good terms to go to TEST, since that is better for their growth.  Not gonna lie that and say I'm not sad to see them good, but it is hardly 1/3 of our members.  Pubez wasn't exactly a contributing member, and was on the list of corps that was going to be told to up their numbers or leave, having less than 20 paps a month for the last 3 months.
---
TIL only certain people are allowed to run a killboard
---
Do you think they would ever say anything else there? CCP like any company will almost never publically admit failure and will just spin it as success. In this case ccp is making rapid changes and are some how claiming certain changes are the best thing ever.
---
Is the Sensor compensation skills important at all anymore after the ECM changes?
---
Does it only affect resistance towards ECM? Or does it also help resist things like senor dampening?
---
if any corp member owns the skin, whoever is authed to do so can apply it. if the member leaves corp the skin returns to default
---
i would say whoever installed the structure can set the skin at installation time, but if the structure was transferred to another owner that probably would break gates or something
---
No, what what I'm trying to say is \*it matters because we all upgraded to Omega later\*.
---
If things still operated on the 14 day trial or whatever it was, we would have quit. We would have quit because EVE is near objectively not very fun for the first month. Being Alpha clones let us train up a bit and actually see the game for what it is.
---
"structures are really really big and we only have enough paint for one coat."
---
Better yet, improve faction warfare by having players join either concord or the trigs
---
Yep I agree just like real life the more crap you own the more it cost to figure out what to do with it.
---
What should bother you is that this incompetent company actually decided to make balance changes because they couldnt automate bot detection and banning in 16 years.

Taxation is theft
---
Found the goon.
---
Think about how cheep stuff would get for a while when everyone started offloading their clutter
---
You’re missing their point.  They can afford it - others cannot.  It’s entirely on point with “we can have a super umbrella and others cannot”.  All because of scale.  
---
It’s not a straight brained dead argument against a drain... it’s an inclusive argument against a biased system that disproportionately affects smaller groups.
---
As heists go, this is a bit like busting open one of those old coin-operated parking meters.
---
do you kick people out if they know how to do any of the fortnite dances 
---
what if they say something negative about social security
---
it's called economies of scale, it's just a fact of life being in a massive organisation is far more beneficial than trying to take on the big guy as a small group. No amount of attempts at balance will work in a way you would want it to. We will always be the best positioned to adapt to any of these attempts, and 100% of the time the smaller group will eat shit. You absolutely can't balance by nerfs exclusively, trying to take things away from everything doesn't buff that which is worse than it it just lowers the levels all round. Now if they were to give buffs to being in smaller groups rather than consistently making nerfs out of jealousy then maybe more people will be enticed into avoiding the bigger blocs.
---
I bet there is industry guys out there with billions of m3 In structures in ore and minerals how does that make sense to store for free lol
---
Not a goon.

Just someone who isn't a fan of overused, low quality memes.

Gonna tell me to htfu next? Or adapt or die? Or some other bullshit?
---
I mean... why not?

zkill is open source and i'm pretty sure anyone could launch an alternative at any moment if they wanted to

You lost the event. It's a social experiment to check when people start complaining about the dice rolls.

---
So basically more citadel mechanic fuck up?   
---
Wow what an asweome feature those have become huh
---
They probably don't have much of anything to say about it because most people aren't personally offended by people creating things.
---
I understand that you cant take fights these days because damn near every fucking autist has a cyno with retards on standby. I have personally seen this many times, so you are really arguing against reality here.
---
&gt;Ye imagine being able to fking trust dscan to not have 50 fking cloaky ships behind you. That would be fking awesome.
---
Cloaking is a different issue. We can discuss it if you like, but that changes nothing in terms of issues related to cynos.
---
&gt;You are clearly just a griefer type dude, you only want safe kills. The worst kind honestly, just go join CODE and stfu about things you dont understand.
---
I dont want any of that shit. I want real fights that are not predetermined and taken based on free intel from zkb.

I think htfu is appropriate here.

It really does, my dude.

Dank ticks mang

This guy gets it.
---
Are you suggesting 250+ Muninn ratting fleet is somehow overkill?
---
he makes an alt and stores the titans on that char ad infinitum, and on top of that he now has the ability to field all 4 titans at once, yay for increased titan blob!
---
Now we're into 'what if's' ... And Hilmar has been spitballing now for three weeks and throwing new ideas out there, but has yet to fix the REAL issues we all agree are glaring. Wake me up when he addresses time-zone tanked citadel spam and the horror that is Fozzie sov, which every major content creator in the game has pointed out now for at least three years on this sub.
---
I'm rich!
---
Not if it was free under a certain (Titan) amount.
---
Titans should be expensive to use and maintain.  No one wants all these titans everywhere.
---
That’s good. We need more services. What if Squizz just decided to shut down Zkill one day?
---
Well it was Karbowiak and Squizz that ran the original eve-kill which then got replaced by zkb that they created together
---
wasn't this the name of the old killboard from way way back in the day? it was eve-kill.net or something
---
DD's are already a seperate skill chain bud
---
Okay. And?
---
A *moving* NPC statino. That would be pretty wild.
---
"killmarks" anyoen can get them when you can spam press F1 in a fight....nice come back...freaking sad that you have to involve politics....you  must be a liberal...makes sense now since your spin rotates more than the freaking earth around the sun
---
No that is where eve is failing. A huge Corp has massive overhead costs and only makes up for it with world class process control. Small startups kill giant corporations all the time by being nimble and not having exposure to huge overhead liabilities. Eve currently does not follow this model because there is no risk to a corporation growing to large. And having a sloppy run organization can mask really sloppy process with numbers. If some changes were made to the way growth works inside corporations the big guys would need to be run like world class business to keep pace with smaller groups. Even your argument here proves that you feel you need no process change to combat change other than “we can just throw isk at the problem” that is not real
---
lol CAUSE ALL THE PVP IN THIS GAME IS ONLY IN NULLLLLLL SEC , 20 day old toon btw,
---
what you didnt know theres 3 types of guns you can fit onto your ship , neutrons, ions and electrons? and theres alzo different sized railguna too wow ahh  eff  are you always so fucking scared of losing your 60m cruiser because a guy lights a cyno to scare you away from his ratting battleship.
---
btw  pvp vs pVE’rs is fucking lame
---
why would they say something lmao. Zkill is open source, you can literally just copy the code and make your own
---
I bought 3 month subs for my characters then paid some horrendous amount of ISK for the MCT certificates. 
---
I'm pretty broke now tbh.
---
Is what I did!
---
OOF
---
Never said that, I don't even know what these acronyms mean.
---
 I'm just saying that any tool directly biased because of botting should be for what it's worth: a biased tool that is not enough to analyze the datas.
---
A higher death rate too
---
I dont know the exact name, but if you want to talk to wormholers its Lazerhawks open chanel, they all hangout there
---
Considering past experience with CCP data gathering, you expect a player from 2003 to trust you on this?
---
And? Having more than one character training on one account is worth more than subbing another account
---
Correct most of what we see now is entirely human behavioral and will be nearly impossible to design a game around to circumvent
---
Christ, they still don't get it.
---
Olmeca is unable to accept that we don't want the game to die out from lack of content but doesn't understand the nuance that if it comes to letting the game die or throw away years of hard work to get to the point the games going to die.   
---
Olmeca comes from the apocalyptic view that we should make the game progressively shit till the null blocs cave in and everyone miraculously takes up small gang.  
---
We come from the stop making it harder and harder for people to try and catch up to us view point.
---
This thing is a monster for med plexes btw
---
No.... it really doesn't.

Or just X up in local because it still exists and their name will be that much easier to find. Or search for them in the citadel you're both likely docked in. Or literally any of the other methods that you refuse to acknowledge because you're a turtle pigeon.
---
must be pretty bad at fitting ships
---
You were at just under 3k when you swallows the DW alliance into req.  now you’re back to pre DW levels... with a dozen more systems to maintain sov over.
---
He definitely landed. Can we bookmark a coordonate inside a FW outpost and then warp in ?
---
What is a turtle pigeon?
---
Imagine people valuing friends over their overlords agreement for a trade blue donut, boo fucking hoo
---
Yes people try to hunt anyone running L5s. Also they aren’t necessarily fun XD.
---
HTFU
---
What’s not to get?  If they want to make an alt and omega it and buy the skill books for it - loot at all that isk veloicty.  Now mr 400b is down to 300b or less.
---
Yo pass some of the shit you were smoking when you wrote this post. Shit must hit like a damn truck
---
&gt; They can afford it - others cannot.
---
This isn't true for a mass/volume based tax. Supers and titans will pay it. It would be marginal for subcaps.
---
are you aware of just how many doctrine ships are moved in order to wage a full blown null war? are you aware of how much m3 that takes up? because I can assure you it is far more than a couple of titans worth, the hulls alone, think about how many megathrons are moved when the imperium mobilises for war, there are thousands of the hulls, then add in the bhaalgorns the guardians the lokis etc and thats just one doctrine
---
so, we should expect goons to invade Eso soon-ish?
---
do it
---
The structure is limited hard cap.  
---
If that special case scenario wanted to omega and skill into and field all 4 titans I’m not sure we’re really talking about that one guy.

Trace complete.
---
No, to be honest it doesn't bother me that CCP isn't the first game company to discover the magic anti bot formula.
---
That hasn't been my experience in my 7 years as a Belligerent Undesirable, but I'm sure you know better. 
---
Sure, corp thefts may close a few doors for you, but they'll open just as many others. Most of the time nobody knows or cares.
---
I’m sorry we won’t let you kill us easily.
---
Who’s the fucking idiot who allowed you to post?
---
Yup use it or pay for it.  My business would pay for inventory which is why we convert it to WIP and FG to sell.
---
3.6% not great but not terrible
---
Good bot
---
the guys that are against pineapple pizza!
---
and he can turn that 300bil into a trillion pretty quickly again just by fucking with the markets over the course of a week, so no real loss or sink. somewhere else in this godforsaken post i made a point about why balancing by trying to nerf big groups rather than trying to balance by buffing small groups is a bad idea and we should stop even entertaining the thought of it.
---
Maybe they are a forc emultiplier but you just fought bad af. You used risk averse ships and then used them even more risk averse.
---
Pineapple pizza deserves the firing squad
---
&gt; What if Squizz just decided to shut down Zkill one day?
---
This would spell DOOM given recent events
---
Yeah idk then.  There needs to be something at that 1% of wealth that has nothing to do with asset safety.
---
Well, even less reason to do anything with the market. Fuck 'em.
---
So from what I can see you can either punish the individual because the alliance is big or try to punish the alliance cos its too big where it can be worked around via the individual using loopholes. and punishing the individual is a poor choice it just makes it less and less interesting to the individual to even play the game.
---
I can count on two hands how many fleets have been pinged for dreads n up since March between legacy and frat.  
---
How many fleets for munins, eagle, harpy, etc... unmeasurable.
---
Uh, no.  Asset Safety is exactly what we had before citadels.  It just took you making some contracts instead of clicking on Asset Safety.
---
Idk about you but reading this gave me a few dead brain cells
---
The guy in my corp already bought the books for the last two titans and the alts and is training Doomsday 5 now on the last two. He's one of my directors. He can store, sub or unsub whenever he wants. I'm sure Goons have many more dudes like this.
---
https://killboard.winterco.org/
---
that should trigger you even more
---
It's a made up animal. Combine the two of them. You are that.
---
1. You can fly just fine as you are. (Alternate methods to do what you want are available)
---
2. You refuse to fly and instead get into your shell and yell about it how heavy your shell is. (Your posting)
---
3. You spew poop everywhere you go because a pigeon's ultimate life goal is to poop on everything.
---
Don't judge me. I'm creative.
---
Bless. I’ve been looking for this for ages
---
He’s just spewing nonsense at this point.  His hatred for the mega coalitions completely biases every literary word his spews
---
Your posting is lame specially if you are serious.
---
If you shoot the pizza then the chef will just make more.
---
I know bud.  What if it cost to reacquire it each month.  It degrades.
---
Then we shoot the fucking chef
---
You'd just think that the new one would have more features, not less, when it comes to stats and advanced searches etc.
---
I think we need to completely move off of posting about balance changes out of jealousy and have CCP brainstorm ways they can give some level of buff to smaller groups.   
---
I feel the general reddit hate mob is intent on running the game into the ground just to spite those who are already successful and Hilmar reads these then thinks  its what everyone wants and then you get the bigger guys being shit on but the smaller guys still find a reason to complain because its not quite hitting that sweet spot they thought it was despite us repeatedly explaining how it wasn't going to help in the first place.
---
So.. kind of like you guys being Baboon Groundhogs? Beating your chest and hollering and then hiding when you see your shadow and foretelling 8 more weeks of structure loss? I like this game.
---
We just need everybody to leave and the last 2 pilots to kill each other all day everyday, then eve will have finally reached it's maximum potential!
---
Wanna hear the sick part? Guess how he made his fortune. Literally buying and reselling titans lmfao. /u/LightningSky_SPVG. Can you explain yourself? haha
---
Thanks for proving my point
---
Right he’s a complete rare exception to any rule ccp would implement regarding asset safety or storage of assets.  
---
He literally gives zero fucks.  
---
The rest of us would give some fucks depending
---
But the point is by doing so would start to spend his wallet down a little and create some isk velocity
---
I just mean reputation in general. Depending on whos jimmies you rustled and how rustled they got it can leave a lasting mark.
---
 I'll let you know how long it lasts after I stop eating downvotes on reddit and insults everywhere I go.
---
dont forget to visit me pls
---
Once the first dev uses an ESI endpoint they've marked it as "theirs".
---
It's basically just like peeing on a fire hydrant.
---
My ~~121mil sp~~ 122milsp main keeps getting 50,000. Idk what you’re talking about this is great.
---
200mil fit? I would love to see it. I'm runing c3 site with a solo praxis but it's more than 350 worth because I need a pith x x large shield booster to tank enough...
---
They havent discovered shit.
---
I get behind that, even if bittervets will laugh off all hiseccers, if you want to mission then Im sure you can find experts in that field and join them for a few weeks. You will get better help with figuring ou the mechanics than in a nullblob. Once you know what you are doing there is much better content outside hisec.
---
Huh. Gorilla groundhog sounds much better. Or even something like a chimp flamingo.
---
You could use some work, TP. I'm sure you'll get there someday.
---
I mean I think we’d rather tax/punish the biggest groups more than the little guys?  Isn’t that what you’re saying
---
But only in pulsars.
---
maybe, but then a possible negative is dude who flys a titan fucks off from the game for a few months for whatever reason, illness, work or something comes back and then their titans useless and they get demotivated. A lot of proposed change just seems spiteful.
---
Explain how you intend to use it.
---
Exactly, just like everyone else. Now bugger off
---
But now asset safety can be abused via magic wand whereas before the assets had to be physically moved
---
I would say move into lowsec first and daytrip into wormholes since lowsec has the highest probability of spawning wormholes and figure out what you want and if it’s occupied or nah.
---
&gt;I'll let you know how long it lasts after I stop eating downvotes on reddit and insults everywhere I go.
---
What did you do?
---
by all means go ahead and make it that a large alliance itself not it's members pays a higher tax on things, but like i said earlier its economies of scale, we can eat up that increased tax and not even flinch, so it's ultimately redundant.
---
^ this. 10 times this.
---
Gorillas fight....
---
Totally, mate. What the game needed was another short range ship.
---
been watching it for a few days and seems like a lot of new features everyday
---
No. If you try that you’ll warp to the gate.
---
No he just retrains it.  Maybe it takes a month to reacquire idk.  
---
Look titan proliferation is a problem.  If you want to invest in a Titan that still needs to be a significant investment and why not have some penalties associated with letting Titan skills degrade if you go afk. 
---
Notice I don’t say vanish or disappear.  Degrade.  Requiring some investment of time or isk to max up again.
---
You really aren't very bright, are you?
---
Who said you should be able to take fights against caps in their own backyard? This is the part I dont get. And you dont seem to realise that any change to benefit a small group is going to be used on a whole nother level by big crews. It would mean, if you get caught you are dead. Period. No one is going to be able to help you. And with blackout it is much easier to catch people. Combine those 2 and you have all but killed NS PvE. You think people are gonna stick around in NS after that?
---
I mean for real now. Put yourself in the shoes of others. Imagine the scenario. Would you stick around? 
---
Oh yes it does. Read the above. You cant stack advantage with advantage. Every child gets that dude because they are told they cant have all the advantages on the yard. 
---
Then dont go where the fights are fixed. How about that dude? Honestly would you go punch a giant in the face? You wouldnt because you know that you most likely are gonna lose. But this is what you are arguing for here. This is what most want, the ability to punch giants and win. 
---
You dont see it? I mean really? Outside of the narrative building, you dont see how you are asking the giant to kneel down so you can easier hit him? 
---
To use another example, you are walking in solo into a arena for 5 with lower level and worse gear and you are complaining that you cant win against the other side. This is entitlement, everyone else adapt to me, pure and simple. 
---
Get 4 other friends, same level and same gear and the playing field is even. Like others have been doing for quite some time. If you cant then sorry dude, that part of the game is closed off for you, period.
---
From what I understand, yes if you're willing to put in the work.  And have at least a scanning alt in the hole at all times
---
Let’s say for a minute the players tax is factored off an index meaning yes it would be more expense for players in delve/goons than for those in like fedup or something smaller. Would you see players moving assets around to keep their fees lower?
---
I am a player from 2003. Well, 2002 technically.
---
Your point?
---
20 days old and aggressive while being wrong. Yeah, seems about right.
---
Have fun fighting some AFs with those blasters.
---
If you don't like it don't use it. It's still a great ship
---
Yeah, that just happened. Fucking shoot me for voting for this guy.
---
Damn, than this is not working, as real people coming back and just multiboxes are shrinking
---
sooo a person is making something..,,.... so they are a fucking idiot?... 
---
what.the.fuck.is.wrong.with.you
---
Blackout tears detected...
---
Knew it would be too hard for you to stop parroting stale one liners.
---
&gt;  there is no risk to a corporation growing to large
---
lol my sanity is at risk. After 450 toons, I went a little more crazy :) &lt;3
---
Its shit and added nothing to the game. The last thing we needed was another brawler that basically cant die before running out of cap. As if we didnt already have more than enough of that because of overpowered claps.
---
I mean do we need to epeen?  Who literally cares how he made his wealth.  There’s more than one or ten savvy players who were in the right place at the right time. 
---
I suspect some of them now have bought up all these rorqual hulls people have been dumping off.
---
Intentionally vague buzzwords like 'vibrant' really inspire confidence.
---
Bookmarks don't work in FW plex. One thing that could have happened to you is that you were orbiting the plex beacon at 7.5km not the landing beacon. The plex beacon itself is like a 30km structure, so when you try orbiting it at let's say 10km, the actual distance from the plex beacon becomes 40km. You can see that clearly when you turn on your tactical overlay and select the plex beacon to orbit at 10km, the circle indicated becomes a very large one. You need to orbit the landing beacon (the one that you see at +-4km when you land. It's hard to explain without any images, but there are always 2 beacons in a FW plex, so turn on the tactical overlay and try orbiting both of them, you'll see what I mean
---
c o p e
---
eh part of me from my own perspective as a titan pilot would be ok with just outright deleting titans and supers and reimbursing the SP and some isk so that it can be redirected into subcaps. This would also undoubtedly piss a lot of people off, but it would open up a lot more subcap play and open up a lot more counter play than the current state of things of light cyno drop the hammer.  But at the same time it's possibly a way of not just nerfing, its a redirection and a buff to subcaps.   
---
Maybe add in a thing where you can keep them but have it so supercapitals and subcapitals cant interact with each other so that you cant rat in a super or drop supers to save people in regular carriers ratting and actually have to form up a subcap response fleet, and have supers for stuff like structure bashing and escalating between theirselves meaning people still get their endgame content of massive ships, without supers and titans blocking out any attempts at subcap play.  
---
these aren't massively fleshed out ideas but they at least to me come across as a way that it could tone down the incentive to have super proliferation, and possibly incentivise subcap plays.
---
Monthy and daily active users. Those are affected by bots in the same way. Yet they are being used by CCP as a means of explaining how the blackout is a success. And people are saying ye those numbers are correct.
---
But at the same time they are saying the login count is wrong.
---
Both suffer the same drawback.
---
And you cant exclude bots from the data. So you have to include them but atleast try to account for them. CCP hasnt even tried to do that with the MAU/DAU, neither have the players.
---
A great example of exactly what I mean in real business if each person is responsible for 450 separate roles things go bad pretty quick
---
TIL eve only happens in null and the only pe wee pee is vs ratters , carriers and supers. 
---
just unsub already
---
I don't know about this evekill one, but zkill is missing stuff the old eve-kill had like ten years ago.
---
FRT only needed 2 years to become a super/titan powerhouse in this game while others needed almost 10 years to become what they are now. All thanks to botting, AKA winning by any means necessary, AKA Chinese gaming culture. Many will say I'm wrong but now that Mango is here lets see how big they'll be in 2 years... Both FRT and Mango leadership said not allowing bots in their alliances or renter programs when they started to settle in nullsec. We see that FRT. lied like there's no tomorrow but we'll see about  Mango. I'll welp my super in a lowsec event if Mango turns out to be fair and square.
---
Still better than being an afk botting platform. Go cry somewhere else little bot.
---
&gt;In a parallel universe, Eve players are spending as much energy enjoying themselves in-game, as the ones in this one spend on trying to outsmart the game's CEO...
---
So if that requires like, no effort at all, that means there is a parallel universe where people put in not effort to play eve? What a said thought!
---
this is likely a network issue that is not caused by CCP. they cant help
---
Not trying to epeen. I gave one example in hopes you guys get this. In real life it's the same, the rich get richer easier. It's economics of scale. And he really did make the isk flipping titans, not Rorqs. Anyway, nice chat over morning coffee.
---
No man... the chef is innocent. Shoot the customers!
---
Mm, yeah, so as I thought, Navies for a questionable tracking upgrade and don't bother with augmented unless they're Hammers and it's a Dark.
---
I don't think assets is the thing it should be based on, maybe have the alliance maintenance tax that goes to concord increase exponentially as members go up. I mean every change can be gamed and we could probably get around it but it could be that feel good change that smaller groups might feel vindicated  by
---
HI PL! Still salty? [D'awww.](https://i.imgur.com/yBlgWqX.gif)
---
How could it have been flown? (this is coming from the PH side)  I think the biggest issue was we didn't have enough to screen off the fighters and logi can't cope with the volley damage from fighters.
---
Also in a typical fashion this will hurt new characters that will see massive taxes on their unskilled character and say fuck this, I pay enough taxes IRL.
---
I’m failing to see what you claim is being misunderstood
---
just like you havent discovered a good fitting yet?
---
Wormholer clearly telling new player to move into a WH so they an loot his stuff in the future. I see your ploy. Downvote to hide the truth.
---
I was in frat space last night, i don't think they are having trouble. Almost no subcap ratters anymore but nyxes as far as the eye could see. Nyxes didn't even care that we were tussling with a myrmidon in system with them they never missed a beat.
---
Neut Stratios vs cloaky Proteus, who will win?
---
And that's why we have a holding corp where ONE person has access to XL structures and all the isk. I did this after a director clicked the the wrong button an assigning roles and for a few minutes made accidently made everyone in the corp a director lol. That UI is horrible.
---
There’s lots of possible fixes to the titan proliferation issue I’m just spitballing what might help that in some way that’s all.
---
Who the fuck are you?
---
wow like, triglavians wernt added , too bad most of their ship excel at kitting and long range
---
Is...is that a lot? I feel like what I do pulls better than that.
---
I totally agree with you here. I assume CCP has others statistical tools, but in that case I wonder why they don't talk about them.
---
Thing is i like to run sites there and for that i have to go for gillas..drakes..
---
&gt;It would mean, if you get caught you are dead. 
---
Already at that stage. And you also cant fight anything because cyno.
---
&gt;You think people are gonna stick around in NS after that?
---
How much should I care about a bunch of crabs that refuse to play unless they can drop 97 titans on a cruiser? What are you really arguing?
---
&gt;I mean for real now. Put yourself in the shoes of others. Imagine the scenario. Would you stick around? 
---
Why in the fuck should capital ships that SHOULD be strategic assets that are slow to move be used to instantly bailout anything within a radius?
---
Explain why a fucking carrier should be effectively faster to get to somewhere than an interceptor. This is beyond retarded.
---
&gt;Get 4 other friends, same level and same gear and the playing field is even. Like others have been doing for quite some time. If you cant then sorry dude, that part of the game is closed off for you, period.
---
What the fuck is this shit? The problem in that case would be that your opponents teleport in 400 other dudes and "gfs" the fight.
---
Ur not wrong.
---
If you have the "chance" to balance a ship, you dont make it useless.
---
No shit - ccp can’t monitor player activity and requires other players to do that for them.  
---
They then break 12 other gameplay styles in the process.
---
There isnt a good fit. The ship brings nothing and dies to a bunch of afs.
---
obv bomb is just anchoring on FC
---
U asked 3 to many questions and gave 2 much advice for 95% of the spod brains in eve.
---
People have been saying eve is dying since before the game launched.
---
Please leave lowsec local alone, there is a reason i left whs, and now null has no local... Just dont remove it from lowsec too
---
If they wanted to fix botting they would add automated detection and banning.
---
They literally added nothing to game with this change. Split weapons where half of your dps cant hit anything. Good fucking idea.
---
thats your opinion. the vexor navy is easily one of the best now with 3 bonuses. just because you’re scared to brawl , or incapable of fitting a new ship, dosnt make it useless.
---
Actually please don't post again.
---
I was talking about categories, not sizes. Rails are useless because no tracking, and blasters have no range. Its just useless. Half your dps is gone.
---
A very important caveat.
---
Dude, noone cares that you're shit at the game. Good fucking riddance
---
You cant brawl because they drop carriers on you.
---
You would think they learnt something about split weapons, but no.
---
Nobody knows but CCP what the  bottom line is doing.
---
pretty much what could one expect from a blob member, with nigg in their name...
---
I can also tell you they have 3 less Thanatos.
---
Does this bot do anything but shit post empty threats? Every time i see one of its comments i still see the post in new.
---
No u shot the parents of the customers because they raised their kids to think pineapple pizza has a place in this world.
---
I've only been getting the 10k ones as well, wouldn't be too bad except it only takes like 8 hours off of training time.  And I'm relatively new and trying to get some Industry skills to V.
---
the irony is you fail to understand post you reply to.
---
#######virtuesignaling
---
if you’re so scared of a cyno, you should go back to high sec where it’s safe
---
Okay, I've got to admit that I respect and appreciate the good sportsmanship you just demonstrated.
---
Wow, who's battleship are you polishing to keep getting 50K?
---
They also have one less XL SMA. Remember to keep your poses fueled kids!
---
Like which features?
---
I've been grudgingly doing the 10k ones, like a good F1 monkey.
---
**\*Eep eep\***
---
Sent you the fit in a pm
---
**F**
---
I've only had the 10k SP per day, every day. I created an alt to mess around on for a bit and he has a 25k SP one available. I'm a new player too, it's kind of annoying.
---
I’ve claimed one of these by accident, I didn’t do it back when they did the 10k daily reward, not gonna bother now. 
---
Helps the new boys out though. But I agree it should not be RNG based.
---
\[Yes it's that!\]([https://i.gyazo.com/64ec50ca7ff262288b622474f1c5386d.png](https://i.gyazo.com/64ec50ca7ff262288b622474f1c5386d.png)) I recorded the fight and have always the overlay on, so I can confirm. I didn't pay attention at this on the moment, it's good to know for the next fight!  Thank you o7
---
i like you.
---
hugs?
---
**NOOOOOooooo**
---
PS. *I* ***AM*** *the senate!*
---
damn. did not expect that. Who are not blue to TEST/Goons then? I am looking to rejoin the game but dont want to be blue to everyone.
---
Sure, in stations. Player owned? If they want to.. it's player owned. =)
---
My god the weeb... it burns my eyes
---
i missed that...
---
why is that?
---
Meanwhile it's been pure shite looking for content outside of nullbloc space, gate camps are boring change my mind
---
We were at about 2700 after the DW merger.  Most of the corps that left were either dead weight upset that we started enforcing things like standarized rorq fits, and mining fleet requirements, or people who wanted to change the entire focus of the alliance to be a hardcore pvp only group, and were downright toxic about it (CEFED, and Dangerzone for instance had people celebrating their departure, and were responsible for about 300 people)  A.PU was upfront about giving REQ a shot when we recruited them, and flying with them the past 8 months has been great. 
---
In short, all I'm saying is looking at raw numbers is not a good metric for alliance health, and assuming any group is going to remain static is silly and unrealistic.
---
That wasn't really a challenge.
---
The new owners are going to have a freight service.  It's going to be bringing in a lot of stuff from Jita.  It's not going to be moving much towards Jita.
---
So some JF pilot from the new owners would happily move your stuff instead of traveling empty.
---
It’s easy to say all this was intended when you’re literally making it all up as you go and throwing shit against the wall to see what sticks.
---
They prevent fights. So they must to be fixed.
---
&gt;it’s almost like you forgot carriers wont track your cruiser that well now because of mouthbreathers like you who just bitch and whine and want everything nerfed to the ground or stupidly op.
---
Its almost as if a 20 day toon (and presumably player) shouldnt talk about things it doesnt know anything about.
---
Lets pretend they care about how retarded you are. You are still welcome to play, arent you?
---
You are definitely earning your namesake today.
---
Because when you're done training it you have two omegas on one account
---
I did that with MG crystals once with my alt that got caught in a stop bubble but got his pod out... Swear I thought I swapped clones before undocking but nope
---
My arms are wide open!:)
---
Getting closer and closer to fortnite online with each passing day of this blackout... 
---
All these kids with short attention spans requiring minute to minute stimulation.
---
clearly, you’re wrong again. 
---
20 day old toon that clearly understands the situation on both sides better then you, as well as game mechanics.
---
&gt; Local - primary source of bot intel
---
&gt; VNI - Primary bot ship used
---
&gt; Alpha changes - Cheap cost free way to run said VNIs
---
&gt; Market Taxes - punish market bots
---
This is a bad thing how?
---
It’s wow online with this shit.  Go grind 5 boars in Elwyn for today’s daily quest. 
---
Garbage.  Unoriginal.  Uncreative.  Boring.  Desperate to try anything to keep the active player counts up during blackout so they have statistics to exploit.
---
t. goon poster
---
No it isnt. THats subs.
---
Why would they care to entertain you, the minority? They fking pay the bills, not you.
---
"Should", your opinion.
---
Thats simply a blatant lie. They can jump yes but that incurs penalties. Its the same as having a jb to a system, the sceptor will be there in the same amount of time. It literally doesnt mean anything.
---
No, its you stepping into NS, the arena, with fewer friends, levels and gear and expecting to win a fight there. If you cant then you want to nerf shit.
---
Literally what
---
You can play all you want, you can even post all you want. Just don't expect anyone to share your batshit retarded opinion.
---
It's a cruiser version of a BNI now, it's a great blaster brawler.
---
It's not my fault, I'm just a smoothbrain c4 wormholerbtw.
---
Mind sharing as well? I live in a C3 WH but have only done up to cruiser-level ratting.
---
I've thought about playing Eve for a long time, but was always too wrapped up in other games.  But now I'm looking for a change and Quill18's recent video series got me interested in Eve again.
---
My main worry is how much of a timesink it would be.  I'm a hardcore casual player - hardcore meaning I try to maximize my skill and play as best as I can and really focus on playing well, but I'm also casual meaning I don't have hours every day to devote to a game.  I'm busy with a job, family, etc. in real life, so I need a game that doesn't blatantly incentivize maxing the amount playtime. 
---
I've read a bunch of "what you should know about Eve" type guides and content, but none seem to really address this point - how much of my time will Eve demand in order to play at a reasonably high level?
---
Good change! Without the ratting taxes, the big alliances can't afford to subsidize pvp. This drives content by giving us more money for SRP.
---
looked at dotlan theres like 6 systems a system that have anything going on at the best of times outside of the nullblocs, I roam I look for shit to do, now the only time im guarenteed to find something within 3 hours is if i set up a gate camp in delve and thats boring as shit. but thanks for assuming i just sit in delve all day.
---
Who gives a fuck what squizz or karbowiak have to say about this? They are not the arbiter of what people can and cannot make.
---
You've got my CSM vote.
---
Having problems reading English?
---
Yea what does this mean lolol
---
Where?  I’ve looked too.  See zero activity outside umbrella regions.
---
But u can only log into 1 at a time
---
sounds like we have no vets on the reddit but rather new kids who doesn't understand.. it was clearly the evekill reference.
---
pro tip: "random" doesn't imply "uniform"
---
why not in citadels? the main issue is keepstars anyways
---
Aw heck fren, not again. I keep losing these social experiment events. **:/**
---
do you remember battleclinic and evekill.net?
---
No I'm just wondering what Olympic level mental gymnastics you had to do to relate this post to fortnite and short attention spans?
---
Is the entire corp is full of assholes and your the only one not an asshole... then I hate to break it to you, you in fact are the asshole and not them.
---
So you think there is an objective argument to be made why the largest ships in the game should be faster than an interceptor. Explain.
---
&gt;Thats simply a blatant lie. They can jump yes but that incurs penalties. Its the same as having a jb to a system, the sceptor will be there in the same amount of time. It literally doesnt mean anything.
---
AFTER you have jumped. This means you are there faster than any other ship in the game.
---
&gt;No, its you stepping into NS, the arena, with fewer friends, levels and gear and expecting to win a fight there. If you cant then you want to nerf shit.
---
No, the game is designed by absolute retards, ensuring stalemates since you cant fight unless you have the most amount of shit.
---
You dont even know the difference between gun sizes and gun categories.
---
&gt; I'll let you know how long it lasts after I stop eating downvotes on reddit and insults everywhere I go.
---
Heh, have an upvote.
---
literally nothing has changed, the exact same places it was before the blackout
---
do you want me to list every region in the game?
---
that i do.  
---
 Battleclinic the number 1 place for fits    
---
while evekill was the number 1 place for killboard and even evekill's sister site  EVSCO where people could get their own killboard
---
And instantly as obsolete as all the other brawlers we already had. Good.
---
I find it kinda hard to be annoyed at the presence of RNG in this event, given the presence of RNG in so many of the other game elements I interact with in this game. Relic sites, ghost sites, where my chains will go today...
---
The only thing that's new here is CCP had the courtesy to tell you in advance what drop you're going to get and when.
---
If only changing market orders had a scaling cost relative to the total order. .01isking has been a massive problem since the beginning.
---
I certainly wouldnt expect anything from a retard like you.
---
I honestly dont think they have as much as one would assume. In my experience the things that seem the most obvious are often the things that are overlooked.
---
But even if they did, I cant see how they havent tainted those with login events. Theres simply no way to reduce their effects from the bigger experiment making all data irrelevant. Imo.
---
Grr. So mad.
---
Apparently now it’s all about going and spending 10 mins small gang banging each other.  Die?  Reship go back out.  
---
Battle royale style.  
---
Fuck the big fleet shit.  The major wars aren’t interesting anymore.  I need mah quick hitter of a gate camp on a catalyst bro.
---
there absolutely used to be more shit out in space and more spread out before the change, and if you won't admit that then it's absolutely futile entertaining a debate with you.
---
So right.
---
&gt;theres like 6 systems a region that have anything going on
---
as opposed to pre-blackout when it was quite literally the same thing
---
&gt;now the only time im guarenteed to find something within 3 hours is if i set up a gate camp in delve
---
as opposed to pre-blackout where you could roam for 6 hours and find nothing unless you ran across a malfunctioning bot or a guy who was totally afk
---
you seem to think the issues of 'dead nullsec' only came out because of blackout, when in reality the blackout has caused a massive upward trend in fights all across eve, not just in the big blobs.
---
Seek help.
---
&gt;there absolutely used to be more shit out in space and more spread out before the change
---
then show me statistics if you're truly sure
---
No, he means the paper thing he's holding
---
Sounds like we have some shitty parents to blame for not smothering ther dumbass kid before they grew up to post on reddit.
---
Shit that nobody could catch because it would dock up when you're still 3 jumps out. Yeah fantastic.
---
Or rather EVSCO who had eve-kill as their sister site and all ran by the ESCO team which if i remember right was Hyperbeanie, karbowiak, fly8oy, squizz, plan q, fr0gofwar and ammut
---
What could we expect from a pathetic risk averse blobber... Go press f1 on those pando fleet and pretend you matter.
---
None needed
---
Lock everything and split guns!
---
Openly admitting you are afraid of our fleets. That's pretty brave of you. Be seeing you in space...
---
Lol guys, look at this guy create a website. What an idiot.
---
I literally had content out of my ears before the blackout and now without the false sense of security that krabs have with local they've turtled up and theres shit all to find, those systems that are vaguely active now have a cloaked dude watching the entrance to their pockets and are long gone by the time you get near. Im all for removing a lot of the empty space in the first place but this has made it beyond a joke.
---
These are fucking hot.
---
&gt;I literally had content out of my ears before the blackout
---
post your killboard
---
Thank you so much to all of you. I have no issue with neuts cuz I do electrical  with some extra cap in 1 rig and 1 battery in the mids. I did some t4s electrical in SISI and I only died in a spawn where I flown directly to a group of Vedmarks I think. The thing is that with this fit I overkilled the t3s and never pay atenttion to spawn, ships and how to manually fly. With your help and comments now I know better, ty.
---
shit that i absolutely did catch, as long as you weren't brain dead there were multiple ways to catch people aside from just having very fast hunters, you had people dropping out from wormholes, you had log off traps you had blue spys etc.
---
EVE Player: complaining, complaining and complaining.
---
Those changes are great. Yes, we need many others, but those are necessary.
---
I am against local removal, but thats the main way to tackle bots.
---
The main problem in eve atm are ratting supers and rorquals. There are many, many others.
---
Yeah, crazy that anyone would be attracted to this game by the intricate space politics and get off on playing the meta as much as the game. I mean, really, who does that?
---
Looks like a good little tilly
---
pods killed in that system are fairly high indeed
---
A. im an FC 90% of the time I press X + left click  
---
B. on my smaller gang fleets I have fuck all on my kb outside of some low sec bs, blue shoots and a velator and hecate the other day after roaming for a solid 3 hours to find them you can find me killboard easy enough its the same name as i post here with
---
You were 2,900 - I know because I was there.  
---
Right and I look at who’s left it’s the PvP focused groups, MMDS, Astrotech, 
---
It would seem to me an alliance wanting to be PvP focused would organize and locate closer to the action and give less shits about their rorq fittings.  Impass is a krab haven.  Legacy should open more of impass up to the rest of the alliance to krab in relative safety if you’re not gonna use the space.
---
Forgot to swap clones let my semi afk domi die when i could have cynod in 2 fax...it was my titans pod/clone.
---
It's tradition on reddit to read the title of the article, leave the link blue, and then discuss it like you're an expert anyway.
---
bro literally all your kills are in delve, or in major fleet fights
---
fuck off you retard
---
Not only that, but zkill will provide their database.
---
&gt;A. im an FC 90% of the time I press X + left click
---
\^\^ most of the time i dont even get on the kills
---
Are they throwing in the towel yet?
---
Eh
---
When I ran with TVP i never got into structure...
---
and as i said, blackout is felt by the hunters and smallgang/solo players, not the FCs and f1ers
---
God damn it CCP, please stop making daddy need more skins for his Levi.
---
Radius means links cost a tiny bit more. Nothing else matters.
---
Providence has dried up a fair bit.
---
Freedom isnt free
---
You don't have the fitting space for a 100mn.
---
They've already evacced alot of their valuable stuff to Drones. But for now they insist on feeding.
---
Yet has been used for whale hunting for years... may want to rethink.
---
Put your hands up for detorid!
---
What a wonderful world we are living in, until we meet people like you, op.
---
Just explain me why do you call people idiots? And why don't you feel like one doing it? 
---
Like you can make this post so good just by starting discussion about alternative killboards and telling us about the reference to whatever is there. It makes people share ideas, critics, etc.
---
Rails works just fine. Stop being bad.
---
when you actually become a "progamer081" you will understand the benefits
---
it's fucked with any attempts at smaller stuff I want to do, now im resigned to just doing the mindless F1 pressing, if that's what you want then that's your problem.
---
So its faster? It warps faster, aligns faster and so on? Rest is explained.
---
Its a jump drive. You want it to not jump?
---
Sure dude, call that fighting.
---
Props to FRT for still fighting despite being insanely outnumbered as a whole.
---
Good fucking riddance.
---
You never did any of the smaller stuff, I went back to march.
---
imagine having short term memory loss
---
Always split guns.  Even if it screws your srp
---
Uh, you'll fit right in with the Caldari side, I believe.
---
Yeah how did that war in tribute work out for you lol. The only content we got out of that was pictures of glowing doomsdays and a recording of a  bunch of nerds Hon Hon honing.
---
Yep real good content there bud.
---
Sounds like PHEW and HTP in Providence.
---
Surely a petition would be rejected since there is no bug or connection failure here.
---
CCPlz dedicated abyssal module market when
---
Or u can just use multi accounts and fund CCP more so they can improve our game and it will never die
---
Good one person shouldnt have a monopoly on killbords
---
So something like the industry index, for markets.  Cool idea. Will generate tons of salt if implemented though.
---
&gt; ~~TAXATION~~ TAX EVASION IS THEFT
---
All T3C are shit except for Loki after the rebalance
---
I know people who used to petition many of their losses in legitimate pvp and claim lag or some overview bug . they got their stuff back
---
So its a minor reskin of Capsuleer Day XV / Capsuleer Elite XV?
---
No Phoenix?
---
Yes https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/ECCM
---
far too many variables to make a market system of it work tbh
---
I sure can.  
---
And that idiot is me.  
---
[Evekill.club](https://Evekill.club) will be a new killboard on the market with no kind of trackers, no kind of ads or begging for your hard earned isk. we are not interested in your money or isk.  
---
We have a active dev always ready to listen to feedback and new ideas.  
---
The site went online yesterday and in a early access state while we fix some of the bugs and work on new features
---
Congrats on having a spy call FRT primaries for you, really pushing your members skill levels to the extremes.
---
Corporate Shill!
---
#shots fired
---
For the love of god, more holobanners please
---
Are we looking at the same skins?
---
Close. But Noraus is away right now, so wait until he's back with his RMT credit cards and we'll see if he wants to dump more RL money into a failing coalition or take everyone to Dronelands and sit under PanFams supercap umbrella, which many are already doing.
---
You are correct! and its also why we are working on a new killboard that will have old features, features from the old eve-kill but also new features that doesn't exist on zkillboard
---
period basis and south delve absolutely count as theyre out of the super umbrella, no one of value dicks around down there so you can't fight with people down there in any meaningful way now that local is gone.   
---
I absolutley used to often go to curse and the like but shits dead bar one pocket, I would take out relatively small fleets to seek content in various regions. Now I'm thinking you are confusing small fleet content for ganking, because I cant be fucked with ganking its boring and not challenging in the slightest, I could go harrass people and lurk around their space scaring their ratters by appearing on their intel till they formed up to chase me out and I could get a fight out of it. Now for that same content I'd be reduced to arranging gudfites that are contrived as fuck.
---
Remove the first waypoint then...
---
low effort trashpost
---
Not sure if stupid or just failing at trying to be funny
---
If the limit were 1 isk, someone would undercut you by 1 isk in no time. Your problem is that you're disappointed that other people are competing with you.
---
Whaaat really? They look rad imo. I'm a sucker for holo banners too. That K's Sacrifice Chimera skin is one of my favorites.
---
I’m new to the game. What are you saying? Cause I’ve only been playing for a few months, then quit, then came back and been playing for 3 weeks since I came back.
---
Team A (311 involved) Team B (261 involved)
---
Winter had caps on field but Legacy didn't. Not really **insanely** outnumbered but hey, whatever you need for your narrative.
---
:wut:
---
Dualboxing &gt;&gt;&gt; 2 well trained chars on 1 acc
---
Fitting depends really, but I would expect a neuting Stratios to win in the long run.
---
I have no idea what I’m doing? I’ve just started.
---
https://updates.eveonline.com/date/2015-01-13/
---
Jesus Christ, you have comms spies in every TEST fleet Doombunny. Just stop making excuses and pack your shit and move to Dronelands with the rest of your coalition before it all ends up in asset safety.
---
Idk, i think the Legion is somewhat useable and the Tengu.... well it does things. Which things i'm not sure, haven't used one in years.
---
Ok so I’ve removed all waypoints.
---
look at ADM or NPC 24h kills before and after... non bot areas like Providence/catch/immensea got hit hard at activity....
---
Mutaplasmid.space works fine
---
Yes all structures should have this
---
Skill extractors exist now btw.
---
Names carry no weight anymore
---
So, you are calling yourself idiot in this post, an I getting it right? 
---
If so, this post is not that good of an ad for it, please consider updating it somehow, so people don't downvote it because they think you are just a jerk. If you thought it would work as 'black PR', I believe it won't because you significantly lower your reach by getting downvotes
---
Storage based on volume, what could go wrong! PI base materials costing 5b a month for 500m in material.
---
Congrats on being outplayed.
---
When is it ending? (Ur Posting)
---
Skill extractors exist. 
---
Names are meaningless and reputation is untraceable
---
Yes, doesn't mean what i said was wrong.
---
I guess you have all your alts/scouts/hunters/market alts/locators etc on different accounts?
---
Don’t provide input if you don’t know what you’re talking about, a c4 3-5 statics only difference logistically is that 1 extra jump through the chain for a kspace.
---
L.
---
M.
---
A.
---
O.
---
This is why I had to start bringing a remote sebo alt to these fights XD
---
Frat sure are bad at flying Munin fleets, not sure what their issue is.
---
Yeah seen the sov grab up there and the ADMs in detorid falling so I’m sorta seeing western detorid up for some grabs here soonerish.
---
See the plus in the list, that means you have set that system as a waypoint. The ones between are systems your current autopilot setup will navigate you through
---
Hope that helps understanding the autopilot a bit
---
this was just to throw it out for a start while we work on the stuff and a properly introduction post will be made once we are at that point.  
---
and yes i am calling my self a idiot!
---
U get from point A to B and back to A
---
What's the deal
---
I agree with this.
---
"Eve is too hardcore, lets make it more casual"
---
&gt;PCU drops off significantly
---
OP: "Obviously we need to make it even more casual, lets try that again"
---
We’re fighting frat in the south since March very actively.  Been no shortage of content that we find fun and engaging.  
---
Pretty sure goons enjoyed their glassing of tribute.  
---
All of these support a bigger picture geopolitical landscape that we as empire builders find more fun and engaging than needing a 10 minute hit of a gate camp - fortnite style.
---
Haha nah dude they are actually really pro, but TEST had a comms spy thats the only reason we won &lt;insert NPC meme face&gt;.
---
&gt;imagine having short term memory loss i know, my english isnt all that great, being that it’s my 4th language and all that.
---
No, this is your only language, you are this retarded.
---
Blackout do the opoossite what people think he will really do. 
---
If CCP want to shake up the game and avoid the statu quo they need to understand how they're own game work. For the moment i think it's not the case.
---
So you are saying that Init and GSF are not friends? I mean, if it is so horrible, why stay?
---
Thats hilarious. The tracking is horrible. You cant hit shit.
---
It gets to fight faster than an inty. Why do you think a carrier should be able to do this?
---
True wasn’t sure you’d go that far.  Good point tho.  Although any decent esi evaluation would question how such a new char got all the SP without the associated plex purchases. 
---
Anything is possible tho.  Love the con job bravo there.  Post an update when you pull the rug!
---
You're asking the wrong person my man, i have never understood why they stay with you given they're almost the exact opposite of goons.
---
Actually not tiny. There is quite a difference between a planet with 5k radius and a 100k radius.
---
Please don't, your work, your team and you deserve more, don't you think so? :)
---
Ah the memories of being in a NRDS friendly Corp with 3 mil SP in 2009 providence. Take me back!
---
That, or was in Assault or HQ fleet and failed to b/c for reps.
---
Fuck off spodbrain
---
oh okay, i see you’re going full retard now. have a good day, good discussion untill full retard. o/
---
Fuck off now.
---
Squizz already said he would love for more killboards to be written.
---
The holos look incredibly out of place positionwise and the rest of the skins is just the old boring two color pattern (imo)
---
Oh ok
---
Have you ever thought you get downvoted based on the shitty content of your posts
---
Or are you just so egotistical you think everyone remembers your name
---
Pet alliances are leaving Detorid and they're struggling with fleet numbers even in their timezone and everything is max-CTA ping spam. Legacy +FI.RE have already cracked numerous ihubs/sov in west Detorid, Wicked Creek and Scalding Pass. The snowball is snowballing.
---
Good point, adjusted
---
Detroit is nicer.
---
i got nothing but 10k SP so far 
---
on 3 alts ...
---
Wonder if there could be botglh
---
Do i detect some salt
---
It has harder sites and is connected to two wh's at all times. 
---
We're talking a low sp duo here, so unless they're rocking some blinged ships it'll take both of them to work the wh's sites, and they'll be attached to two new wh's everyday, with wh Corps in them, that love blowing up blinged PvE ship's. 
---
They'll want hole control whenever they do anything, just think that's a lot to ask of two guys just starting out.
---
That's cuz all your botters are in your rental alliances and not test itself.
---
I have no money in this, I am not part of any of these entities. I did say "as a whole", but regardless. Zkill counts involved players in a different way (perhaps counting reships or pods separately). If you open it in br.inyour.space or br.evetools.org, you get (approximately):
---
186 vs 278
---
192 vs 276
---
Comparing Muninn numbers shows quite a difference too.
---
I too get only 10k one since start.
---
The age of ~~chaos~~ gate camps is upon us.
---
gf wp  
---
selling - munnins in detorid btw hit me up
---
And my personal experiences are there was a lot of resentment between FCON and the tiny alliances who demanded a lot but wouldn't even show up to defend their neighbours. I deny them because they just aren't true. You don't see any FCON people here sharing the same opinion. What you have is a handful of of PF who were as close in their resentment for FCON then as they are now. And they've aaall got their own personal reasons to be upset. So they're... not as emotionally un-corrupted as might want to think. FCON did all the legwork and gave these nobody alliances an equal seat at the table. Half of these alliances refused to lift their weight and never had to. A lot of FCON members naturally were resentful of these people and vice versa. Especially, because they had equal say. And equal right to put forth their own FCs to command FCON fleets because they can't field their own. Even if that FC had no business FCing strat ops. Don't act like I'm some FCON fanboy because I'm fucking not. One diplo has a fucking hissy fit and I was out on my arse without cause or reason I have as much reason to hate FCON as anybody. So without making things personal and explaining to you why certain individuals I will not name, might be holding a grudge? That's the gist of it. A bunch of un-liked nobodies who could never get what they wanted, ragging on a far more popular kid behind his back. If you were some shit tier FC who existed only as a political gesture and you ignore the advice of a far more experienced FC only to lead MY alliance Sleipnir fleet to whelp to MOAS, I'd probably yell at you too. Name one alliance that wouldn't. Go ahead and deny MY personal experiences. If you don't like them.
---
Except he's right.
---
Yes because null has an infinite supply of ISK at that kind of rate with almost no risk. Incursions are very limited in supply (which results in pvp of a sort), requires significant investment and a fleet effort.
---
I do think that highsec incursions pay a bit too much, but it's far better for the game than near-afk nullsec anomalies.
---
hi doom  
---
welcome to the 4d chess game
---
have fun station spinning looool
---
Yup so a corpmate did the ole 1 plex for the cost of 500 in 03-4 contract scam and of course they bit on it.  Gonna try it myself
---
"When CCP says soon you're usually lucky to get it in the next 3 **years**"  
---
*fixed for you*  :p
---
Well, it also works an annoyance to smaller groups that wanna try and evict you, but did they fix the thing where you can bypass the mass limit?  If not, 4 characters could roll a c3 it in like 15-20 minutes i think.
---
Great argument that really showed me
---
&gt; A. im an FC 90% of the time I press X + left click
---
take your been-lings and leave delve, spread yer wings up north and get some frags
---
This is eve it’s zero sum. There cannot be one plus another.  It’s either/or.  God forbid there be like different classes of space to roam or develop different gameplay options in.
---
They have 5 bil in their SRP wallet. Noraus is afk and so are his money. Cap SRP requests are not getting filled.
---
on my main account, where it matters, i got 1x 25k and the rest 10k sofar, trading alt? almost only 50k
---
I know this is not what the video is about, but...
---
Don't approach the anchor!!! Keep at range (dps) or orbit (logi)!
---
huh?  
---
You don't run C4 sites, ever unless you want to be stupid inefficient. This is what I mean.  
---
The 3 can be done solo easily, and the 5 is a dead static for them at the moment, but it gives them room for growth. It takes 2 people with moderate skills to run a C5 site for \~175m/hr.  
---
The HS they get in a 2 3/HS is negligible because you're guaranteed a K-Space through the 3 anyways, and if you don't like it? cool it takes 2 guys 5 minutes to roll the C3.  
---
Most 5's are krab holes, not lived in holes. Less than 10% of the 5's you connect to will be a hole you'll actually see someone who lives there, and usually it's just a small group of dudes unless you get unlucky and stumble upon some fat lad corp.  
---
When you live in a 4, you basically just ignore the home sites and wait for *someone like you* to wander in with "some blinged ships" and kill them, because c4 sites are trash. ( Same with C2 )
---
&gt; No point in t2 heavies
---
It's one of those things that's nice to have if you already did it, but yeah on a 6-week-old character, unless you're going nuts with injectors, there are lots of higher priorities.
---
You're dumb. Tengu is an amazing solo hunter for rattlesnakes and below. It is also the premier pve ship for exploration in nullsec other than blood and sansha sites. The proteus is technically better for guristas 10/10s but only barely.
---
interesting, good read. anything else you want to get off your chest?
---
One of the Test predditors guys has made 40billion doing this so far. Theyve also been running fake munin and sabre contracts using ruptures and thrashers
---
Just catch him with that vni.
---
zkillwhore detected.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76157091/ is the fit I used and had a great experience with. I took too much risk in the end when I got bored of not finding a target and at one point ran from a rattlesnake that was in low armor because his friends showed up with tackle, still wish I hadn't ran
---
This is 100% true, although... who actually did not have their clone up-to-date?
---
&gt; wouldn't complain about podding an empty enemy pod - I do it all the time. The only issue is that I did it at the cost of 1 bill of my own.
---
I get that, that part is certainly shitty, and also ironically funny. Thus this thread.
---
Why is the discord link broken? Can anyone help with a link to the discord?
---
Never not pod. Pod salt, best salt.
---
Exactly!
---
xD gf man shame you didn't warp off lol
---
Ain't we all idiots in one way or another? :)
---
So... go break up the gatecamp? That's better than whiffing on dozens of VNI bots.
---
Fukin R.I.P
---
bring back Battleclinic.com
---
I dont see how this is relevant. I can krab up a Titan in a autism and pizza fueled weekend if I wanted to....
---
Radius can mean a lot for an extraction planet. It can be the difference between just moving an extractor &amp; its associated SF v. rebuilding everything but the command center after you've mined out the local white spots.
---
Yeah I have heavy drones 5, but still prefer navy versions, because they are tankier
---
intricate space politics, playing the meta- lmao ok, this is reddit retard
---
Ah yes. Blue spies, logoff traps and cloaky camping, the pinnacle of PVP in the age of local. So amazing I want to go back!
---
Unlike you we did roam every day, dropping out of wormholes with some of the best hunters in the game. Regardless of how many botters and Near2 users were out in space sucking on the old isk faucet it was a content wasteland for PVP. Even when you did catch some afk guy alliances *intentionally* didn't respond outside of super umbrellas because "it just encourages roamers to come back" and "lol idiot pay attention to local next time". Whatever blackout is it's definitely not worse for roaming.
---
Fly dual-prop Taranis with Garmon and Nexus in 2008, take me back
---
"Play my way or go away".  You idiots will end up being awfully lonely.  So much for a sandbox.
---
His opinion is less than worthless. It's like Enron stock right now. The dude's some """""FC"""" inside of Delve, who's never left his bubble, but can tell you what the game is doing on the other side of the map lmfao.
---
That doesn't look like eve or even like it was trying to reference eve at all?
---
... caldari
---
We are. I think what people are missing here is that /u/Lorenzo_Maulerant is an FC; a content creator for Goons. He has no reason to blow smoke up your asses here. Bubble gate camps and F1 aren't exactly engaging game play for an FC. Outside of the supercap umbrellas it's a wasteland of empty space, whereas before we could take a 20-man roam, kill a few stupid bots and find *some* content. My corp fleets in the last couple of weeks are finding more content by gate camping Detorid, when before, we focused on small-gang roams there. We are just giving you our real-time experiences. Don't hate us for it.
---
I keep getting 10k on my main but my scanning alt has steady hit 50k and 25k and homeboy only has 8 mil SP
---
Nice - nothing like killing frat in ships that frat themselves paid for!
---
Blackout is shit
---
itt: test circle jerk
---
i for one cant wait for all the fun content xix provides once they take winter space
---
But my FCs don't have a legion doctrine so it must be shit!!!
---
Black legion asking for fairness in TYOOL 2019.  Wow have things changed
---
Stellaris been out there for three years
---
Have you been living under a FW plex for this long or what?
---
How do people see this as a problem??? Other traders are willing to reduce their margins, and there eventually comes a tradeoff between frequency of update &amp; amount of product moved through your orders, versus time, effort &amp; isk cost of setting up multiple orders and constantly updating them. If you really want to no-life (disregarding the existence of market bots, which are economically fantastic for most players but fun-killers for market focused players), you deserve to get your order filled first. 
---
If CCP wanted to really squish out 0.01'ing, they'd add a per-order minimum fee greater than the 100isk currently. 1k-10k would realistically add up pretty fast and prevent some of that competition... But dramatically reduce liquidity in goods as traders wouldnt update prices as frequently to reflect the current market price. So, buy/sell spreads would be greater due to increased activity cost (markets less profitable for most players - bad), so fewer people would transport goods to lowsec etc due to the reduced margins (less opportunity for market focused players - bad).
---
This still won't change the fact that it could be using one of ever so many different base mods.
---
The best thing they could do is to create a mutaplasmid.spacd style market in-game with unlimited (or very high) order cap. The current contracts based system is terrible for anything but God rolls and wholesale garbage.
---
Evekill doesnt exist anymore so they free to use whatever name
---
And yes we need alternatives nothing wrong with that.
---
And zkill doesnt own the monopoly on killboards just squizz is a guy that's giving back to the community.
---
Talking of that wheres Chribba nowadays
---
Big blocs are the cancer dude. They all have bots and all of them have known and kept it hush hush when they could. It’s the same shit just reskinned
---
You are an idiot.
---
I flew by a frat fort last night named “bot haven” in wicked creek last night
---
Why wait? They're in Tenefis now. Nothing is stopping you.
---
NO
---
DO NOT ENCOURAGE THIS
---
WE LITERALLY JUST HAD A MASS-REEEEE OVER THIS
---
DO NOT
---
The tax changes do not punish market bots. At all.
---
"Gate camps are boring"  
---
Then find said gate camps and kill them.
---
Nice one.
---
That was me. I allowed the post because sometimes it's more fun to watch people realise how stupid their post is than have a moderator enforce the no stupid posts rule.
---
I thought this was gonna be a cool story about actually podding yourself. You podded an alt
---
Recruiter from decent corp - Hey how you get all these SP noob?
---
Noob - I heisted some isk from a shitty highsec corp.
---
Recruiter from decent corp - Oh ok. Welcome aboard.
---
^How this usually goes.
---
It's why i left Goons a few weeks back. Boredom nearly killed me.
---
They should definitely do this in test.
---
yes seraph let me just undock from 1dq warp to the gate shoot blues, gate camp over yay fun. no they're fucking boring, if you can match an enemies gate camp they scatter thats no fun.
---
I mean Doom you have a test spy you could just called the targets test was broadcasting friend.
---
Oh... I like it! o/
---
That there are plentiful examples of why CCP say one thing and do another. How changes CCP make do not have the desired outcome and how CCP favour certain groups of players over others, need I bring up bob and T20? 
---
Point is here, you come out with your soundbyte of wanting blackout to be permanent because you know it plays well with Reddit. It’s your job, you are a community manager. Your job is to make what flows down from above you palatable for players, but what I am seeing in addition to this is a pandering to a specific type of player that has caused CCP massive issues before. Maybe you don’t care anymore? Maybe you know the trajectory of the game is down from here? 
---
Eve is a microcosm of hundreds of different play styles that CCP used to know was the strength of Eve, you’ve turned it into a bitter and twisted rage fest where people are even more vile to one another than I have ever seen before. I hope you are not proud of this, and I hope you realise that pandering to one group will simply accelerate the decline of this game.
---
No answer in other thread since i posted it right before this went up:
---
Make sense on a market alt. The rest id agree dual boxing is just better
---
Shots returned.
---
A small nos will cycle fast enough to maintain a scram.
---
Reddit is terrible for discussion, great for circlejerks.
---
legion very good for gate camp
---
Majors props to Alek and his crew for establishing the freeport market there. Any smaller and less experienced groups looking to get their legs in null should definitely check the region out.
---
Something not mentioned in the video but N-6 has great proximity to some other regions as well and has several lowsec systems within jump range for a JF.
---
Because nothing else has happened in a long time. If this had happened during the CA vs SA time or BoB wars, or goon wars, this would have flopped massively. The reason it’s been recurved so well is because Eve is boring as fuck.
---
We'll see when economic report comes out. My suspicion is blackout didn't really make much of a difference.
---
At this point you need drastic changes on a biblical level turning the entire universe upside down to break the current stalemate of mega null blocs. Something equivalent to, for instance, climate change in real life to cause complete chaos in eve.
---
This is a tough question because what's "a reasonably high level?"
---
One unusual feature of Eve is that you don't have to grind exp points to advance: skill training happens on wall-clock time whether you're logged in or not. So eventually you'll get those T2 guns and ships as long as you're paying your sub and keeping skills in the training queue.
---
If you want to PVP (in other than large blobs as a DD) then there are some between-keyboard-and-chair skills that take some time to develop. And if you follow the (wise) advice to be in a player corp, your social ties to the group will depend somewhat on how much time you can spend in game. The support you will get from the community depends somewhat on what support you contribute.
---
Some non-PVP activities are inherently time-consuming, like mining or flying in incursion fleets. Some not so much, like planet resource extraction and processing (at least if you're not the guy with 10 accounts scraping dirt off of 50 planets and feeding it to factories on 10 more). Some activities (like market flipping, or running a vertically-integrated manufacturing enterprise) can expand to almost any amount of time you're willing to devote to them.
---
"Playing at a high level" can mean lots of things, from competently being space-healer in shiny PVE fleets to being able to expend T1 ships like bullets trying (and sometimes succeeding) to get solo kills against other players to being fleet commander for a group that can put 200 butts in seats for a fight. The last one I'm not qualified to talk about, but the first two are plausibly reachable with 10-15 hours a week of play.
---
&gt; Freedom Tax
---
Where's my Freedom Dividend? I ain't paying that tax for nothin'!
---
It depends on what you decide to do in Eve - it really is a sandbox, so there's a ton of different ways to play the game.
---
For example, if you're doing industry, building stuff "at a reasonably high level" is managing some market orders, figuring out what raw materials to buy, managing jobs and hauling stuff (or contracts for hauling stuff).  That's easy to do in small amounts of time.  Market trading also doesn't require long periods of time.
---
If you want to be an alliance military director, you will be required to make much of your life revolve around Eve.
---
And there's an enormous variety of stuff to do in-between those.  So your time commitment will more-or-less come down to what you think is fun.
---
Its not. Certainly more than adequate for something like that. Spyware discord is best avoided.
---
Recruiter-  Welcome aboard!
---
Noob-  hey can I get hangar access?
---
Corp Director - yeah I’m sure you won’t steal from us too we’re special
---
Hilmar needs to be barred from making changes to EvE. Where's the Korean overlords to protect their investment from his Hákarl-induced hallucinating?
---
Is this copypasta? I swear it gets posted at least every other day
---
To be fair, how these changes could fuck anything up is way outside my imagination.
---
&gt;Nergals can do t3 firestorms and a blingy garmur can do t3 darks alone.
---
Haven't tried the Garmur, Nergals tend to be really expensive. I sort of run into the T5 cruiser issue...to do them you have to risk an expensive ship and hope your connection doesn't crap out ever. I also run them in null so getting trace camped is more likely.
---
&gt;What ship are you running for t2?
---
Retribution, AB fit. My fits costs around 350-400 mil including pod. Almost perfect skills, still at assault frig IV and beam spec IV. Get around 370 dps with multi, 208 with aurora.
---
I've lost about 7 retris but they've all been cheaper fits than the one I'm using now. I've tried both AB and MWD fits and ended up sticking with AB, they both have advantages and disadvantages.
---

You see the arts in things, even if against the dinos, and that's what I appreciates about yous.
---
It is the price of being able to own things.
---
I'll have to respectfully disagree with every single point you've made in these three paragraphs. 
---
Feel free to dredge up T20 - I was on the other side of the fence as an angry player when that happened. Completely different company now, completely different people. Your point is entirely moot. Correct, it was a shitshow, and it was dealt with when it happened way back in the day. You screw around like that at CCP these days, you're out of the door. It's as simple as that. I get accused of being biased on a daily basis, and of being a cheater. One day I'm being accused of being biased toward PL, the next day it's GSF. Life goes on.
---
On your point about soundbytes - news flash - anyone who knows me knows that I don't pander. If I have something to say, I say it. I don't give a shit what "demographic" it plays well with - if I have an opinion on the game as a 17 year veteran of it, I'll be sure to express it, both externally to the community, and internally at CCP. Admittedly that's caused friction internally too at times - even recently when I've been vocal about my views, but that's what makes CCP great - we're encouraged to talk about our products and what we like and dislike about them. Sue me for having an opinion and wanting something that I think is for the betterment of the game. I don't pander - everyone is equal in my eyes and I don't care for politics.
---
My job as a community manager is to communicate, correct, but it's not to stand by and watch the company sit on its balls if I can help prevent that by giving solid feedback from our players. That's my job. Whether that feedback is listened to is at the behest of people above my  pay grade, but I make sure that voices are heard - that's what I do. That's what all community managers do. We're the front line support for dealing with player sentiment, regardless of whether we agree with it or not.
---
On your point about a bitter and twisted rage fest, one of the best quotes I've ever heard from a player was printed in the "Into the second decade" book that we published on the 10th anniversary. It read "Mark my words, this game will be dead in six months.".
---
That was a quote from 2003, yet here we are. EVE has been "dying" and "declining" since it was conceived in the eyes of everyone who doesn't like the changes that are made to it. People come and go, opinions change, but the people who stick around are those core pillars of our community who realise what the objective is for New Eden.
---
Sorry mate, but the three step approach of trying to shame me about history - which was set right years ago, trying to tell me how to do my job, then trying to shame the community because they're excited and debating changes that are happening to the game doesn't fly with me.
---
We'll have to agree to disagree.
---
&gt; No idea why you would protect them.
---
Yes that's clear.
---
Hi!
---
Long time Waffle here. (7 years)
---
What is this Fortnight thing you speak of?
---
&gt; I mean, if it is so horrible, why stay?
---
Because the goons that we actually deal with are generally nothing like you.
---
When you remove something, something naturally replaces it. Remove air from a volume without putting anything in its place and it is still replaced by a vacuum. You must define what the state of the system you want to change will be after your proposed changes have been seen through. Why is this so hard to grasp?
---
If you left everything up to reddit, the entire cluster would look like c1 wormholes, and FW would be no exception. Also "spyware discord"? Crawl back to your tinfoil cave.
---
And i feel bad about bombing my own bomber time ago...
---
Your history ease my pain bro.
---

---
The one that's just labelled "beacon" on the overview, not the one that's labelled "&lt;*size*&gt; &lt;*faction*&gt; (Istallation|Outpost|Compound)."
---
Anyone can appreciate good propaganda
---
No drake variant, 0/10 
---
also no chimmy variant? -10/10
---
But we sure as hell can speculate wildly!
---
Thanks, those are good points.  Playing at a "reasonably high level" to me means getting to the top 20% of equivalent players, however, that's measured.  For most games, that's statistically measured or based on performance ranks.  Sounds like Eve is much different - which is a good thing. 
---
I'm not sure yet what I would enjoy most in Eve, so I guess the best thing to do is dig-in and see if what I like meets my level of available commitment.
---
Ya this is bullshit... been waiting on a good caldari skin.... forever now.. best you come up with is a All white skin (iam sure that took alot of work) and a reskin of another skin.... 
---
Come on ccpls..
---
Thanks, that's an informative response.  Sounds like I just need to get in there and see what I find is fun.
---
Amarr/caldari space is the most travelled space so keep those above -5 as much as possible. My main has -6 amarr and it is a colossal pain in the ass. Ive been to lazy to fix it.
---
You underestimate CCP. And it's horrible creation - the Legacy Code ™
---
It's a lot sooner than most (all?) other stuff CCP's ever tagged as arriving "soon"...
---
I wouldn't consider this much of a heist. 1.5bil is pretty much pocket lint. Just take it and fuck off. No one will care a week from now.
---
While the intention is good, the fact would be that such a change would actually screw over anyone that's not already a giant.
---
As is, large entities can't really micromanage their many orders *too* much. There are cases where they invest a lot into one product, and can have many orders up to basically instantly 0.01isk anyone right after the other party does their update. But those are somewhat niche adn typically coincide with market manipulations.
---
If you had to pay 1% per change of order though... well, whoever is selling the most wins.They just need to place new order over and over for small part of their total items, starve out competition until they cave in, adjust and pay that 1%, then the big entity places another order, repeat until the small entity has basically lost any and all profit, then it leaves the orders placed by the big entity without competition.
---
Adjusting anything related to market orders is *really* hard considering how players can just place many orders or use many alts. Most anything i can think of that would aim to "improve" things would mostly just backfire as a tool that screws over the majority of players. Eve players are too damn good at figuring out mechanics and exploiting them for their own maximum benefit.
---
Makeing daily chores.....
---
Have you tried not being in goons then? Sounds like your problem is all the blues. Boy sure is rough when you're in the donut I guess.
---
It's okay Lorenzo just come join me in lowsec and maybe these people will respect ya
---
/s
---
Reddit is just as much spyware, maybe even more.
---
See you again tomorrow.
---
What a surprise, a nullbear twisting statistics to suit his own agenda. Nice write up.
---
Howl's Moving Station.
---
&gt;  If you really want to no-life... you deserve to get your order filled first.
---
Well put, you have my upvote sir. Your 2nd para is also spot-on.
---
The first + is a waypoint. You’re basically going there then making a round trip where you cane from
---
Tengu is still a hood fun ship, it may not be mainline as it once was but it has niche uses. Every t3 has a purpose/niche.
---
Legion is good at gang bang, but is far less versatile than Loki for small gangs or solo
---
I mean, 2 mid slots, why...
---
Truly shocking that people who don't like Blackout would misrepresent statistics in a way that makes them seem both correct and credible.
---
Thanks for putting in the leg work to not only get an accurate representation of the data, but explaining your decisions behind what to include/exclude.
---
yeah, let me just throw friendship and community in the shitter so i can gank a couple of non english speaking goons that are outside of the umbrella, totally solves all my problems wow great plan!!
---
in the first immediate month after the blackout, sure, let's give it another one and see how it looks then
---
dude suitonia, i appreciate you trying to explain this but the dudes that hate pvp already have their mind set, the guys that go roaming already know what's actually going on, and CCP has the *real* statistics anyways.
---
you're wasting your breath with the spodbrains.
---
Interesting how those "omg blackout best thing ever" circle jerkers not showing themselves in this thread. No problem making up shitty stories how blackout has made the game so much better. Just have a problem with facts, numbers, logic, etc.
---
If they toned-down the blue of the banners I'd like it more. It's a bit too saturated for that colour scheme, imo anyway...
---
Actually, I think you were right to begin with.
---
“Fewer dollars, less money” was how I was taught.
---
If you can count it, go with fewer.
---
And obviously, you can count kills.
---
So: fewer kills, less PvP*
---
* not that the reduction in kills is necessarily directly related to a reduction inPvP, I have no idea, just going full geek.
---
Truly shocking that CCP would exclude the PCU (players who can actually be in space at one time) from their metrics and go instead with the DAU/MAU (that includes people just getting to the log in screen to redeem SP bribes) to hide the fact their idea was bad
---
Waah they nerfed the most broken ship in the game into a balanced ship and im m a d
---
Logic and facts aren't things these nerds want to hear. Let them have their fantasies.
---
out of curiosity do you have total value of those kills per year.
---
Statics are made to be twisted into your own view.
---
Because this is a fucking video game.  You don’t need to replace a shitty mechanic.  Make it 2,700/hr.   Period.
---
You're right. I just forgotten the names of then so I used simple terms
---
So cool!!! Glad you're enjoying the system and using it to generate even more great content for the community.
---
Congratulations. You have just defined what will replace the mechanic, proving my point.
---
Actually if you listen to their interview, instead of papa mittens or whoever, they say those who logged in for just the SP reward were accounted from and removed. MAU and DAU are significantly more accurate than PCU. Your choice to believe them or not is an entirely separate coversation that likely won't end up anywhere that matters, because no one but CCP actually has that data/methodology.
---
&gt; based on statistical performance. Sounds like Eve is much different
---
There's not a leaderboard as such, but there is [this](https://zkillboard.com/top/lasthour/solo/). Though the things some people do to make that metric are, well, questionable.
---
Everthing about the game has improved in Blackout.  Ratting/Mining is more fun in groups with defense online.
---
Roaming content of all kinds is super fun and intetesting.  Trying to catch VNIs was major boring shit.
---
Entosis fights are more fun too with no local.  Have to actually check nodes!!
---
I'm with the OP.  Things are epic.  I don't miss local at all.  I've already forgotten what it was even for.
---
Nah, your opinion is a complete waste of space. You know literally nothing about the game and that utter lack of knowledge gives you zero basis for an opinion about how the game should change. You have nothing of value to add to the conversation, so I have no idea why you think CCP or anybody else should listen to what you have to say. You don't even seem to be aware that at *every fucking point in time* CCP has received crazy amounts of great and detailed feedback about everything. Every change. And they refuse to do any of it, while chasing their own shitty vision of what the game should be like, to the detriment of everybody playing the game.
---
“Proving my point” what a douche.  
---
Nothing “replaced” it.  We’d remove the attributes system and hard code the SP/hr rate.
---
This is pretty sweet :D
---
Statics are static, unless this is some weird post-modern statement, or you meant statistics. No players have access to the data or how CCP interprets it so literally any comments on it from either side is completely baseless and generally just confirmation bias
---
&gt;and hard code the SP/hr rate.
---
Exactly. That's a replacement for the old system.
---
I like the blackout. But i also live in wh space. My primary concern is that nullsec is eventually going to empty out. And that every nullsec roam will be like the one i had last night: me and my corpies jumped around an area with super high npc deltas but saw almost nothing but nyxes for a couple of hours before packing it in.
---
I hope it doesn't go there. I hope that's not the fate of all nullsec.
---
You could do Incursions. 150Mn will get you a basic Rokh good for WTM and you can make ~100Mn an hour. Not too much ISK but it's good for someone who's just starting out.
---
C3 Ratting in a Rattlesnake
---
My Vedmak currently gets away with around 400dps. Little slow to kill the drone BS, but otherwise completely workable.

So um... there is isk generation and extreme isk generation. You can do a lot of isk generation solo. PI, explo, mining— all of those have minimal startup costs. I say this as someone who only had one real character for a year and still was able to earn several billion from my first skill point to about 17M SPs.  Over 5B isk earner even blowing up a bill of it in that time. 
---
You’re not really space rich. But it let me buy cruisers and frigates and fit them and blow me up.   
---
Recently I have created a series of Alts, but more because I want to experience more sides of the game (and focus their training there) rather than really becoming space rich.
---
Buying plex, at least paying your subscription with real money, finding cheap ways to pvp. DED site running and exploration are doable and okay ISk making ways but they will eventually turn into a grind. You can also win some tournament, contest or giveaway for some isk if you are good and lucky.
---
Yeah I'd really like them to continue blackout through August at the very least. It'll be good to what the data is like without the Drifters at the start of the month, and also running it for longer than 30 days is a good idea to see how many people who came back on 30 day subs stick around and how many people who were waiting out the 30 days on their PLEX/1 month sub leave.
---
Is it possible there were 2 major wars going in summer of 2019 vs summer of 2018?
---
&gt; Have fun in the Dronelands guys!
---
Wait what?
---
still doesn't change anything about them ommiting the PCU that defines how many people are in space at one point or another, going from publicly available clear metrics to not public ones that rely on us just trusting people trying to meet a performance bonus.  
---
Also believe it or not just by being a goon doesn't mean I only get my information from mittens, I'm perfectly capable of autonomy and perfectly capable of viewing the same things you have to come to the conclusion I have. That entire podcast stunk of shameless pro-blackout propaganda, there was no attempt to counter or call in to question anything that hilmar and falcon were saying. They can release the unadulterated metrics for all to see if they really want to prove it. but through my own eyes of actually playing the game, space has got a whole boatload emptier and the PCU backs my own eyes up.
---
That might not be the future saltonia wants but its the future he will get.
---
bird poop ships
---
Thanks for clarifying.
---
Including these ones.  Further all the variables haven’t been accounted for primarily ongoing wars.
---
This Post is bull'Sh-- 
---
Suitonia now hired and his stage name is CCP Propaganda
---
it's always a choice between a giant douche and a turd sandwich
---
July 2018 had the UALX-3 fight and the 'Entirety of EVE' war or whatever you want to call it.
---
that story has been played out and people have grown. dude got kicked for breaking the rules at the time. 
---
racism sources?
---
Eve is a multiplayer game... so play it by yourself with your alts for F*cks sake
---
That's not what the PCU is. Its not people in space, it's just people that have selected a character from the selection screen regardless of what they're doing iirc. I think I know what you meant, but being specific is pretty important to representing the data right. And PCU is a shit metric for a ton of reasons that have been beaten to death
---
Again, what you think of the podcast or if you believe CCP is a useless conversation because there's no way to verify the data besides taking CCP at their word. Anecdotal evidence both in "space is so empty and dead" and "were getting so much on roams" are equally useless.
---
Would this be just as effective in other stealth bombers? (Sorry if this is a dumb question)
---
Well done, thank you for this!!
---
kill the nyxes
---
&gt; and also running it for longer than 30 days is a good idea to see how many people who came back on 30 day subs stick around and how many people who were waiting out the 30 days on their PLEX/1 month sub leave.
---
And also how many people unironically learn to adapt. The other day we dropped on a mining fleet which promptly decloaked 5x sentry domis at various spots 150km and frankly gave us the fucking business
---
I openly laughed when he said something like 800 new players download the client each day and create a character.  So over the course of a year 10x the current active player count could be populating new eden.  Whatever.
---
Lol do not compare building titans/supers now to years ago. The game is completely different. The issue isn't just isk related. Citadels and injectors alone made it significantly easier to get super pilots and supers.
---
July last year was also UALX/The hell camp and the whole campaign.
---
I can't take your numbers seriously. You aren't even accounting for **all those excavator losses** that practically never died before and now are dying in 5x truckloads per rorq. 
---
But, I'll give you props for learning from CCP on how to pad stats in your favor.
---
&gt;  PCU that defines how many people are in space
---
lol, no, it absolutely doesn't.
---
I think I got one 25k on my least important alt but that's it for me too
---
If you look at podkills as the metric, they are down about 4% based on the 2019 yearly average, down 15% from the 2018 yearly average and down 7% from the July 2018 number.
---
All these idiot changes will kill server population. Thank god I quit playing after 13 years.
---
Did you ever come on one of the RR Exequror roams? God damn that shit was so fucking fun.
---
That's what I love about new CCP changes. It's not about what ppl living in 0.0 wants. It's what's single players roaming 0.0 in kestrel thinks Is good for game or other gankers visiting null sec from time to time for those ratting pinatas. Keep it that way.
---
It’s free karma for me :)
---
**Bots still exist so CCP can use them as a scapegoat for their changes**
---
Change my mind
---
I think this will probably be what I do. They also sound like they require a bit of social stuff/people talking back and forth so that's nice too.
---
&gt; That's not what the PCU is. Its not people in space,  
---
Sorry I didn't write that out as I meant to, I meant to say "the PCU that defines how many people CAN be out in space at one point or another"  
---
&gt; Anecdotal evidence both in "space is so empty and dead" and "were getting so much on roams" are equally useless. 
---
I don't disagree, but unless CCP get a whole lot more transparent whilst we definitely do know they have a performance bonus to meet in a couple of months, then the only thing I've got to go off is my own experiences which is much more empty space outside of nullbloc space and thats not conducive to an engaging or fun playstyle, and before I get the usual response of "just leave goons duh" the largest part of still playing this game comes from the fact that I'm part of a community within my coalition and have many friends within it, that goes away if I ditch all that just so I can get some dank frags in what would be my former friends space.
---
NRDS rip, ty ccp.
---
Seems like the number is actually a little lower than I would have hoped for. There were also 3 long-term move ops (two of which were region moves for major powers) in nullsec in July that did not happen in July of 2018, two new umbrellas coming up (also did not occur in July of 2018), and what should have been much more harassment around those operations. A 3%-9% increase overall seems a little light given the overall stagnation of nullsec in July of 2018, target availability in July of 2019, when combined with a mechanic that not only made harassing those operations more interesting, but also small gang and black ops play in general across all of nullsec.   
---
I'm not saying the mechanics change was bad, I've been enjoying it to the fullest, but I would have hoped for a better rise than 3-9% given all the pieces that were moving around the board last month.
---
They don't count as 'ship kills' do they?
---
editted my mistake
---
There's lots of fun counterplay to be had in the blackout! It's definitely not advantage-attackers; it's advantage person-who-prepared-better in the face of uncertainty.
---
That is not my impression.
---
Fk CCP, seriously, they could have warned people in time and give us a specific date.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/ship/41030/stats/](https://zkillboard.com/ship/41030/stats/)
---
July 2019 Excavator losses: 1,738  
---
July 2018 Excavator losses: 338
---
The amount of Excavator losses accounts for 1.4k kills. Which would reduce the total 'Player Ships' killed from 3% to a 2.25% increase. Although I'm not entirely sure why Excavators need to be removed from the data. It's still ISK Destroyed that otherwise would have been unassailable prior to blackout.
---
you sound unhappy, maybe this isn't the game for you
---
Again, here you are, not knowing what you are talking about. Do you even know who your alliance deals with? Of course you don't.
---
If you liked these other goons so much, you wouldn't team up with Snuff so often over your actual allies.
---
Not day 0 but yeah a 'newer' player should be fine. Generally no-one will evict you if you keep your structure fuelled. Living in a wormhole as only 3 people will be a bit of a drag regarding scanning and rolling though.
---
I believe they do actually, same with fighters.
---
They have been attacking your allies ever since they fucked off out of The Imperium. It is nice to see where your loyalties lie.
---
Pretty much. Its almost like hearing politicians talk, you know its most likely BS but its too much work to even start dissecting.
---
Have an alt inside to scan you back in.
---
Yes, it logs a bunch of info. But you are ignorant.
---
The reason they stay away from reddit is because they would likely get their shitty ideas trashed and deservedly so.
---
I hate myself for upboating you.
---
I'd say WTM is more heterogenous with more options of ships you could fly.  
---
Valhalla was vindis, nightmares, machs but we wouldn't turn away a new person unless of course they were flying for 2 years with a basic fit and made more than enough to upgrade their stuff.
---
You could say that's elitist but then again a duck is more elitist than Warp to Me.  What even does elitist mean?  It's not like you expect ascendancies out of everyone just better fits so that EVERYONE makes more money.
---
“I too can cherry pick numbers to suit my argument”
---
-suitonia
---
Using dotlan, kills are up yes but jumps are way down - -12.9%
---
July - 2018:  39,873,724
---
July - 2019:  34,719,688
---
Pod kills: also down:  -7.1%
---
July-2018:  181,645
---
July-2019:  168,738
---
So on and so on.  
---
So basically, a smaller group of people got killed more times in July.  
---
Sounds like we still have the same problem of growing the game.
---
lol @ all the updoots for RMT on zkill
---
yes always balance in favour of the minority that can only end up well ggwp hilmar
---
You should probably look into your skills and possibly invest in a tracking computer.
---
northern pandemic horde of initiated goons, pls ignore.
---
Good propaganda makes New Eden what it is. This is what I love about TEST... hate on us all you want, we still give no fuks. ;-)
---
It's one of my favorite ships but it really depends on how you use it. It's mostly a skirmish or assassination ship. Great for a cyno hunting and sniping but mediocre for ganking. They're very hard to kill (I'm still flying ther first one I ever bought after 2 years) but most fits just don't deal a ton of damage.
---
That said, I've seen people exploit that expectation to skull fuck unsuspecting targets with blasters, so it all depends.
---
CCP has no reason or obligation to do so though. I dont see them changing stance on it either. I've personally seen a lot of people in space flying around, but don't doubt it probably feels empty for some. I haven't flown through Bloc space much, but NPC Null and not-goons/PL/tapi is pretty vibrant.
---
uhm... driving towards player markets owned by nullsec
---
Wow
---
haha this is epic, love it :D
---
You can always grab a destroyer and ninja-salvage in invasion systems.
---
You'll get ISK and an ample amount of salt.
---
Are you asking me why something in a game is working in specific way? Like it always has? Like trying to apply logic to a space sim?
---
And changing cynos wont change the fact that they still have jump drives. Its just gonna make it tons harder to actually use both defensively and more importantly offensively. If u think shit is stale now, just make a few changes and the game will reach a standstill.
---
Fights would pretty much never erupt.
---
Now I'm skeptical if you really live in Cuba
---
+1 for the Bill O’Reilly freak out reference.
---
Welp, not sure what to say about this tbh.
---
Happening to me too. Seems after working with CCP support, they determined my ISP's DNS is blocking the connection to anything secure having to do with eve like logging in anywhere and they recommend switching DNS server while they work out why my ISP is blocking them.
---
That's AWESOME
---
I mean, sorry you lost your fleet I guess but that's just very cool.
---
This is what peak performance looks like
---
There used to be a provi guy who did this constantly in the same system, and still everyone bit lol. Such a unique and interesting way to use the mechanics
---
&gt;I'll welp my super in a lowsec event if Mango turns out to be fair and square.

Decent copypasta candidate. 4/10
---
My alpha alt has been getting the 25s, super helpful to it, I'd be very glad if I were a new alpha player.
---
With 3 tc3s and 3 bombers? Not likely. It's not our fault that snigg rolled 3 times and couldn't get anywhere close.
---
Havent kept up what happens there. Assuming they are still dropping on Provi?
---
I certainly wasn't intending any hate. I live in PB, and have had kind of the opposite experience - far fewer bots that were difficult to catch anyway, but a more expensive, actually-manned ships in space to catch, and more escalations to bait out from breaking up camps. Having fewer people clustered a bit more tightly instead of system after system with two VNIs grinding idly away at dozens of forsaken rallies, is a much more realistic game. Roaming into space and instantly catching a malfunctioning bot might be harder, but it's increased the opportunities to catch bigger fish and generate fights from those catches (or from busting up camps in a proportionate fleet), especially if you're living close by to the hunting grounds and can react or escalate quickly.
---
Honestly, I feel like one of the biggest issues for some of the null block FCs is that the line members in your fleet have either got to stage well away from "home," burn a jump clone every day, or take a ton of gates to get to roaming grounds. Any of those make it feel like (and be!) more of a chore to get out there and start shooting stuff.
---
Unfortunately that's a not-insignificant portion of the playerbase. I don't think they should be catered to in anyway, but it's a shame everyone will just keep agreeing with what they want to believe.
---
&gt;CCP has the *real* statistics anyways.
---
The part "blackout killing the game" seems to ignore/not trust.
---
Yeah but that happened a few years before the blackout hit.
---
A few days ago I was curious about this myself, and made a script to sort the last 100 days, and average it out post/pre blackout.  It should be more accurate than using a monthly total.
---
Average kills per day before Blackout = 12093
---
Average kills per day after Blackout = 11824
---
From my setup, it has gone down, but by an extremely tiny amount.
---
Just... Shoot the gate camps?
---
It's.... so.... beautiful!
---
Yep since Black Out content outside of them as pretty much dried up.  The randoms havent been seen has much, probably due to Providence emptying like Chernobyl when Black Out happen.
---
Come to Verge Vendor, we'll whelp ships at you anytime
---
&gt; CCP has no reason or obligation to do so though. I dont see them changing stance on it either.   
---
If they're so confident in their figures and felt enough that just saying its totally great was enough then I see no reason why they wouldn't show them to us for all to see maybe that might put to rest a lot of our concerns, but whatever.  
---
&gt;  I've personally seen a lot of people in space flying around, but don't doubt it probably feels empty for some. I haven't flown through Bloc space much, but NPC Null and not-goons/PL/tapi is pretty vibrant. 
---
I've spent hours at a time looking for shit in space, a quick perusal of dotlan generally shows at any given time about 6 systems with any real level of activity per region outside of the bloc space, admittedly most of delve and places like that are showing as fairly active but it's now pretty much murdered off places like catch where it would almost always be content central without too much danger of people dropping every big toy they had on your head. but pre blackout the ADMs were up over larger amounts of space and there was ratting activity of some sort in nearly every system at some point during the day. It's also removed the ability to harass alliances into forming up a small fleet to fight a smaller fleet that I've brought for content. It's essentially dropped everything into the category of gank or be ganked.
---
Is that what you appreciates about me squirrelly dan?
---
I am asking why you think it is objectively reasonable from a balance standpoint why the largest ships in the game should be the fastest.
---
&gt;Like it always has?
---
No interest in appeal to tradition at this time.
---
&gt;Like trying to apply logic to a space sim?
---
We usually call it balance, but if "logic" helps you, call it that.
---
&gt;And changing cynos wont change the fact that they still have jump drives.
---
But if you add a 5 min delay, they will no longer be the fastest ships.
---
&gt;Its just gonna make it tons harder to actually use both defensively and more importantly offensively.
---
Correct. This is the intent. A strategic asset should not be instantly teleportable.
---
&gt;If u think shit is stale now, just make a few changes and the game will reach a standstill.
---
Shit is stale because players cant do anything because they get dropped on.
---
let me clarify one thing to you : excavator cant fight back, so counting them like a pvp km is not fair but ok it's give you a km and you can fap on your kb
---
Honestly we were very impressed and compliments were given in local afterwards
---
Let's take about 10-15% of your resists there, Squirrely Dan.
---
I think CCP have it wrong - they said they think that Eve players are "hardcore" but I'd say may be 20% are hardcore.  The rest are carebears looking to unwind by mining and killing some red triangles when they get home... not take medication for their nerves because at any moment a pirate can uncloak and kill your ship.  If I'm right, CCP will have a very happy 20% and a missing 80%.
---
Frankly, I don't blame them for not releasing more data. Literally any piece of data they provide, no matter how good it is, people will find a reason to gripe about and claim that it's proof the game is dying.
---
sigh, being in a gatecamp which is about the only way to get content now is boring as shit its hours of sitting at a gate occasionally shooting the odd ship that strays through, or dispersing because something too big came through, or lighting a cyno and dropping a super on it.   
---
attacking gate camps is fucking boring too, because they only stick about or decloak if they are absolutely confident they will delete you before you do any real damage. Gate camps are shit, fleet fights of all sizes are fun but not a thing anymore.
---
It would make players really think differently that’s for sure
---
In the words of the great u/Lorenzo_Maulerant, (insert British accent)
---
&gt;Are you fuckin retahded?
---
LMAO.
---
Should be doing PI for sure. 3 characters in a good system will make a decent amount of isk.
---
Seems to correlate with the overall general trend of fewer undocks/jumps/kills in total. 
---
One could almost make an argument that the blackout really only will meaningful impact excavator deaths and ratting/mining activity.  
---
Otherwise the overall trend of lesser player activity continues.
---
I wonder if people will move their values over to the TTT in perimeter to get rid of. For the time being I see people still undercut in Jita as if nothing changed. I bet most people dont even notice that they are paying more taxes. I barely noticed it quite, a tricky silent change.
---
Figure 20 million per .5 hours then if you want to make more you have to give up life and just play more
---
&gt;If they're so confident in their figures and felt enough that just saying its totally great was enough then I see no reason why they wouldn't show them to us for all to see maybe that might put to rest a lot of our concerns, but whatever. 
---
They don't have any reason to. That's terrible business practice.
---
&gt;It's also removed the ability to harass alliances into forming up a small fleet to fight a smaller fleet that I've brought for content. It's essentially dropped everything into the category of gank or be ganked
---
Based on the sentiment from smaller roaming alliances, wher btw's, and solo players, it definitely has not. Plenty of small scale fights are still happening. I don't want to come off condescending so apologies if it does, but maybe being in a Bloc for a while has dulled your skills in how to find and make small scale content. Something that takes longer than ~3 weeks to learn to do.
---
I agree, attributes are dumb and learning implants are dumb as well. They're no different than learning skills of old. Keep normal bonus implants those are fine.
---
I'm down for this, most of the relatively assured way to get a fight atm has been going to low sec and prodding people, but this doesn't improve anything for life in null unfortunately.
---
Risk vs. Reward - Time for HS to get a pay rise lol :P
---
That is as hilarious as it is dumb.
---
But, in the interest of "educating" you, I will say that your suggestion will not work because the base tracking of railguns is too low, and you cannot fit a TC because slot issues (applies to pretty much all pvp ships).
---
How do you defend krabships when your farmhole more than likely will never connect to your alliance's home hole?
---
How do you provide backup to a wormhole eviction when the attackers can just deny you hole control the entire time? You know besides autism rolling for hours on end hoping for an entry, which isn't going to happen for ferox #1353.
---
I'm real sad, it got nuked on the 2 seconds from seeing the preview text to opening the post :(
---
I want off mr. Miyazakis wild ride
---
If you mean social as in deltole deltole Intaki and people talking about politics in nasally voices for hours and hours and hours.
---
Holy shit  you just owned Slutonia
---
We still have not seen a full Econ report in the blackout era that will be the facts we need
---
Dude we had a CTA like a week or two ago lol
---
Short answer? Yes. 
---
Long answer? Absolutely, please do. It'll be rough at first if you're not sure what to do, but you'll learn fast and have a blast. Wormhole corps don't generally evict folks out of hand, and respect when you put up a fight. 
---
If a group rolls into your system and starts shoot everything? Undock and shoot back. Nobody has any fun when one side won't come out, and putting up a fight even when it's a couple cruisers against a larger gang still shows initiative. 
---
No fixed connections means that even if they mop the floor with you, they'll probably go home, roll for a new chain, and find someone else to fight. Not really worth the time to evict a small corp that won't have a lot of assets. 
---
Try to find a nice C2 system, that will offer good static connections as well as local sites. Good ISK, good experience, and not too highly contested. 
---
Wormhole life is tough, but it's the most rewarding in the game. I look forward to running into y'all in space someday, and hope that when we meet, you'll be feeling like putting up a fight. 
---
That's what it's all about, blowing things up and having fun. And hell, plenty of bigger groups will let you join in on joint operations too, spread the love. 
---
Fly dangerous, my friend.
---
you might just be bad at it :thinking:
---
Second this.  Boring as hell but you can almost Plex an account on this alone.
---
I can't think of any other mmo types that successfully integrated upkeep costs, can you?
---
Another reason you shouldnt be able to cloak inside a plex.
---
or create alpha chars in single corporation
---
Move assets between them
---
Then don't do it and you're in literally exactly the same position you were before they introduced it
---
Texas Lawyer sized 10-4 good buddy
---
nothing more than a random eve player like me ... i dont care he's a "heron god" for some of us
---
The vast majority of people in my corp like Blackout.  There are a few that do not.  We are a very large corp.  This seems to be popular with more people than you think.
---
Seems like what you're saying is null hasn't changed at all. I don't know what y'all are doing wrong but that ain't the case.
---
Jumps are down 13%.  Less players doing less activity, or some combo of this.
---
So for half a month, which drifter deaths would include too, we have a small spike in 0.0 space.  Ok.  Face value would say more is good right?
---
As the population continues to whittle down, the available targets will start to decline and create more and more of a void of engagable subcap players undocked doing shit.  
---
There’s no shortage of players with strong feelings either way.  I just would say that the general trends are pointing to less activity less undocking less engagement
---
Actually you would probally have to go 90 days.   Just to rule out people who do 3 month subs and are planning to renew.   Not sure how many that is though.   
---
I believe there was just a 3 month sub deal not long ago.
---
No you are right and I have reservations about it to. One thing that would worry me about it is that it basically would be a subscription cost increase as most casuls like me have to buy plex and sell for isk to even keep up in the current state. So that is not good either.
---
Yeah, this is a dumb change. They should have cut the isk at the source - crabsec anoms.
---
It "logs a bunch of info"? Guess what, so does EVE, and reddit. You should do everyone a favor and stop using those services as well.
---
Mine the same ores out of moons as 0.0!!  Woohooo!
---
&gt; I see no reason why they wouldn't show them to us
---
Generally CCP has not been all that open about sign up new account etc data, i suspect it has to do with not giving this data to there direct competition. 
---
There unlikely to change that stance to please a bunch of whiny carebears.
---
You could argue that wow did it best with item repair as no one could avoid it, and better gear meant way more expensive repair costs.
---
Checks out.  Super umbrella.  Very little reason to worry.
---
&gt;  I don't want to come off condescending so apologies if it does, but maybe being in a Bloc for a while has dulled your skills in how to find and make small scale content. Something that takes longer than \~3 weeks to learn to do. 
---
I believe you're trying to be sincere here, but dude I'm an FC I had no problems pre-blackout baiting fights and getting responses, im not talking about just 8 dudes vs 8 dudes im talking whats small to me like a 30 man fleet, it was generally standard practice of going to someones space, making sure we  were seen on intel, grabbing the occasional ratter to get them fired up and they would form and start chasing us and we would get good brawls out of it, now those ratters aren't even there, I don't show up in their intel, and they're too scared to risk throwing subcaps at me if they do so we see cynos and haw dreads everywhere, which yeah might feel like a little fun when you get a couple billion isk on the killboard but it doesn't satisfy peoples thirst for a brawl.
---
Your interpretation of "this is within the limits of being average" is "this is a downward trend?" Lol
---
[Skymother](https://fiction.eveonline.com/new-eden/lore/project-skymother) is in the cards - player World Arks seem more and more plausible...
---
I only bash when they don't fight back, because all that says to me is they weren't using that system anyway.
---
To be fair, we were out Blopsing and killed 3 Thanatos in Detorid last night with ~10 people.  If that's where you were, I am not surprised you didn't find much.
---
you might be content with wasting 3 hours of your life to get 20 seconds of combat but most of us aren't
---
One account with 3 characters and you can net 2.5b to 3.5b per month, updating extractors once per day.
---
The difference is you cant play eve without the client, but you sure as fuck can convey information without shitcord.
---
Reddit sends a list of your processes to somewhere? Funny.
---
That's because their gear didn't die when your ship died. Different cost classes there.
---
Pair the blackout with the other changes people are screaming for, like no asset safety and pretty much killing cynos then man, you can roam for days without ever finding a good target. It will only be alliance sanctioned PvE ops with bubbles and titans on every gate.
---
pre blackout I had plenty of content far and wide, not my fault you sucked at it in the first place to the point you all cried to CCP to make it suck for everyone
---
Agreed but a sink is a sink. I wonder how much isk is saved just by the fact that we get free repairs
---
More player activity, less alt/bot activity.  I am one of the people that has been PvP'ing and not running 5 AFK Rorquals because of the changes.  I will show up as having less impact on character totals, but I am more active than when I was mining AFK and playing other games.
---
Just that real players uses these same things for the same purposes and the fix is the old line “throwing the baby out with the bathwater”. 
---
Instead of fighting bots using more focused methods they choose these broader strokes that then impact literally everyone else.
---
I just came back cause of the blackout and started putting PI shit down for the first time ever, I'm amazed at how much free isk it is. Need to get more chars involved.
---
???   
---
The HAM version does 1K dps with 25km optimal range and 90% dual res profile and an OP repper, with an afterburner that can reach 700 m/s, all cap stable.    
---
What are you on about?  Perhaps you need to buy some more skill injectors.
---
&gt; whiny carebears. 
---
I only pvp, not a krab not a carebear, at least be accurate when trying to insult me christ
---
Funny how the only people I've seen complaining about the blackout have been imperium members.
---
No manipulation just putting out some basic data to see what the community can make of it.  
---
"data on increase/decrease in actual percent of totals." You're right I started the sheet about week ago and updated every other day. Getting back into everything from a Military Deployment when Black Out happen.  Didn't annotate the deltas but it was looking like if this July went it went an extra week it would of matched last years numbers.  So I wouldn't call losing weeks worth of kills relative growth.
---
"Also completely leaving out the "must be" connected data on logged in accounts versus accounts per player" Not sure what you mean there.  There is no public info far as logged in accounts accounts per player.  CCP I does even have ability to distinguish this completely.  I know whole families that play EVE Online.
---
"Taken into account the decline in logged in accounts since 2016 by over  30% while at same time avg. accounts per player have dramatically risen  (because PvE-Multiboxing), these numbers don't look that negative to me.  For a final evaluation you have to collect at least 2 years of further  data " 
---
Where did you get this 30%?  Where is your data?  Make your own spreadsheet with the data you found supporting this.
---
Simply went back to 2017 because CCP said this was the most vibrant summer ever.   Sounds like you're suggesting Bots and multiboxers reason PvP kills are higher in previous years which is rather silly.
---
my tengu shits out like 1k dps, what the fuck are you doing?
---
Thanks for the benefit of the doubt. The dynamics still haven't settled for how people are playing in the blackout imo. It's hard to use "what did work doesn't now" to validate "that's because there isn't as much." 
---
What you're describing is manipulating their Intel to get content, but their Intel has been largely hampered, so it makes some sense that this way of getting your content has seen a hit too
---
As long as you don't bring a blob through or hotdrop us like crazy I'm willing to put isk on the fact that the locals will come out to play. I know it's a haul for y'all though, I've considered taking a pilgrim down to delve to putter around til I die but that's a lot of jumps
---
He said 10,000 a week in March and then 16,000  in July.  With the wish to retain 50% which is delusional.
---
Maybe if you like having a "community" that consists of literally everyone in your active area then maybe don't bitch about not being able to find non-blues to shoot. You create your own problems, live with them. Blackout or no, it won't change that.
---
Then again you're a goon who lives in an umbrella and probably barely knows there's other parts of the game with other people who aren't only gate camping. So I guess being salty comes with the territory.
---
It cost a buck 'o five.
---
My money is on local as nullseccers know it shall never return. I just wish we had a small bit of feedback, direction or rough timelines...
---
Nice to see the Test propaganda machine is still churning
---
meh
---
be less brain dead thank you, instead of being salty that some people have friends and people skills.
---
Also goons vs gotg
---
Yes, very much yes. Small gangs think they do most PvP but a single war will create more kills than they can combined. The southern war is pretty bloody and big fights erupt on an almost daily basis. Just yesterday was a 200b ish (I think) fight.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
define a blob, because hands down I'll bring a small fleet up there at some point trek or not
---
and we can just look at the coalition   
---
WC : 19353  
---
Legacy : 39792  
---
and still those dino'tard are "happy" after 4month of war even if they outnumber them everyday and we don't even talk about the propaganda "Lulz Panfam+WC against us" and other shit, panfam just wait fraternity die cause that gonna reinforce their umbrella   
---
after that everyone gonna enjoy their 8-10month of krabbing before the "last war" then goon just gonna invade esoteria, hope when vily will ask for Panfraternity help they just gonna let them die
---
I think you're forgetting about CQ and the door. I was at fanfest for that. Pretty incredible stuff.
---
Yea, I guess I *do* have less than 20,000 friends which can be rough for sitting around bitching a lot, but luckily the few friends I do have are great for finding fights with, so that's cool.
---
This is very interesting. And in line with what Ive heard from others that have done similar calculations. Nice work.
---
Is it or is it not lesser in post blackout vs prior.  
---
The supposition that its statistically flat is not accepted because when I look at other metrics it’s overall lesser activity.
---
2-1/2% less.  Is statistically significant.  Not materially significant but statistically.
---
if you believe the pcu matters you're a retarded carebear
---
You are 100% correct.
---
I know it's all kind of up in the air but im pretty pessimistic on it, and it's dried up a lot of what was fun for me, pre blackout there were work arounds a lot of people weren't using and there were other changes that could have been made that wouldn't have hit things in such a negative way for people in my view, I won't go into the whole spiel here again but if you're interested have a scroll back through my post history somewhere in there I've detailed some of my thoughts.
---
well... also a rorqual in hisec... with a... shitty fit.  
---
or "player driven war" and you see alot of NPCs attacking a Structure.  
---
Its CCP. nothing new :P
---
Completely utterly delusional
---
Not having to dedicate screen real estate is nice
---
if theres 10k less people logged in theres 10k less people that can be in space, kwik maffs

 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78159667/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78159667/)
---
checking empty systems is fun? waiting for enemy which is not there is fun? seriously?   
---
.  
---
Do we play same game?
---
I agree. No local should just be kept in WH’s but that won’t happen. Less people ratting and mining for isk means more people buying plex for isk which is what CCP is after. Just look at the price drop, there’s simply no way it’s just from people no longer botting because they are or people unsubbing.
---
I know it’s hard to scroll up where I just said I completely ignored it.
---
&gt;why would you NOT trade there even before the changes is beyond me as well
---
Couple of reasons:
---
* margins for trade are(were?) still big enough. This may change now, as the difference of "regular" total tax vs structure total tax has changed significantly.
---
* people are constantly wanting to buy things in jita 4-4; selling things in perimeter, even if cheaper, means mostly your items sit and don't get sold while jita's higher priced does. What does sell will be lower volumes, because the customers are in jita.
---
* structures are a constant threat to losing all your shit, or in the case of asset safety, having it locked down for a week and paying a huge chunk of it.
---
* supporting people you don't like in the game AND with the above point, all your isk now depends on them if you're doing market things.
---
Can confirm, was incursion pilot
---
Oh geez the politics
---
If its within limits then that means the experiment failed. No reason to keep it in. Right?
---
CCP GoodFella is the brand manager.  His job is half legal, half marketing.  To protect and hype the brand of EVE Online.  He is no CCP Quant or Dr. Ejyo.  It takes CCP 2 weeks to publish the MER and you expect them to have a guy sitting at a desk monitoring everything in real time as it happens and interpret it has its happening?    They said were winging it for a bit.  "More acting, less thinking"  Probably doing shit over time and out sourcing the data to trained to crunch numbers and maybe interpret it.    When I was in my senior year of getting my B.A. in Economics.  I had Econometrics capstone course.  Which I struggle on the math side of it because honestly professor was awesome research guy but a shit teacher.  I got some tutoring from Statistics Grad student about to get his Masters in Statistics.  He could crunch the number from my econometrics data, but couldn't interpret the data.  Like coefficient being for every 1% increase in crime reported brought down property values X%. Then how that property value affect the quality of the neighbourhood schools.
---
I mean we got 3 carriers in about that time period just last night with ~10 dudes.  Granted, we were running hot, but we kill them regularly.  
---
You just need to leave Delve.  People got sick of giving Goons content in Delve only to get dropped by the normal suspects. I wonder why nobody will give you a good fight anymore and just brings things to hit and run with?
---
No it’s not lol.  It’s plugging in a hard coded gain rate across the board deleting a bunch of shit from the databases and UI and calling it a day. 
---
It’s not replacing anything.  God you’re fucking dense.
---
You know what, I'm just going to leave you with your moronic conspiracy theory because that just means one less idiot on there. It's a win/win!
---
Nah he meant NPC stations bro - NPC stations are the safest thing about nullsec... we need CHAOS and to bring the danger back to 0.0! NPC stations need to be taxed to influence players to risk it for the biscuit instead of easy moding in invincible structures.
---
lmao tell me more about what counts as a pvp km
---
Makes a lot more sense, so they'll just gonna be running c3's all day. Till they're ready for c5's. 
---
It's kinda hard to find an unocuppied c4 like that though, right? It's pretty specific. And it sure sounds desirable.
---
I appreciate that you won't have read all my responses in this post so far, but I state quite a lot, I've never been content to just sit in delve and wait for content to come to me, I go out looking for stuff, its just that space has got a whole lot emptier especially beyond the ganksphere, killing the odd carrier is fun and all but I find it gets old quickly, getting response fleets doesn't happen like they used to for me it's either empty space or cyno up and supers dropped.  I firmly believe doing something about supers would help content, but only if you give people back their false sense of security with bringing back local.
---
And who leaves the probe and d-scan lists docked in the map like that? Dude, do you even undock?
---
Awesome conclusion! With that level of skill in reductionist reasoning you should look into being a data analyst, plenty of companies would love your expertise!
---
I've came across 2 without POS or structures in them within the last week. RG and no effect.
---
They're fairly occupied, but there's a lot of them. They're the ones that any decent C4 corp takes, generally speaking.
---
I mean, if you can't understand how shit works after this exhaustive of an explanation then maybe you should stay away from deep water for a while
---
jesus you fell for that whaler bullshit? lmao the dude just squad warps command destroyers and rides the coat tails of people who actually do stuff in game  - ya'll were all bamboozled
---
I've heard and seen enough to know not to go there.  
---
What happened to the "FW community"? Try suggesting the removal of FW missions and changing LP gain. You'll get some nice responses. It's just a platform for getting CSM votes.
---
I see you have no idea what variation is
---
TBH it does seem kinda bullshit from CCP to change numbers with so little heads up considering the subject of the change. The "announcement" is almost off the launcher, no mention of it actually having launched. I expect people in a few days to a week of now will be returning from holiday (it's holiday season after all), tax numbers changed and unless they ask around or look through reddit's history they won't have a clue.
---
I really wish that were not the default.
---
Small gang/Solo/Blops is great right now.  Blackout was not meant to be great for fleets where the average number of nerds on the kill mail is 50+.  Those are the fleets that ruined the fun for everyone else in the past and now they can't oppress everything within range with perfect intel and a titan bridge anymore.  The smaller and more organized fleets can actually operate now and it is great.
---
Oh yeah. Suicide Roller Alts. That's also a thing. Just need to train them enough for a battleship (or, if you're going to be really desperate about it, just train them enough for a Sigil, a Praxis, 1600mm Armor Plates I, and a 100MN Afterburner)
---
Well it didnt let me add any context but Eve Online just posted their contest results and I won for best battle station and got some cool merch... but wanted to see some more battle stations!

Only manipulation  I did is use CCP Hellmar CCP name. After seeing how words online can affect peoples private lives. I chose not to  his real name despite him acting as a public figure with his private name.   I do not want to any kind of vilification to happen to a person I have never met in real life.  I want be critical of CCP for making business decision to obscure whats really going on  with metrics they havent release to the public that does not affect the meta nor would it affect their bottom line.
---
Just fuel your structure, dont let it go to low power and you should be fine
---
The truth is the tapi just wants to blue FRT.
---
&gt; Keep in mind the numbers are not 100% valid due to unexpected downtime of CCP's API service or maintenance down times of DOTLAN EveMaps
---
My rule of thumb is T1 cruiser is worth ~1 million isk a run. 
---
Every tier above that multiplies by 3
---
Frigates multiply by three.
---
Thus T3 cruiser is roughly 30 million isk and t5 frigates is pushing 300 mill a run.
---
Nah dude I prefer to sit clustered in one of the three cancer umbrellas cluttered together (drones,delve, estoria) doing the only viable meta for a war that'll never happen because of mechanics and diplos
---
a) Falcon doesn't nerf anything
---
b) They are rewarding the behavior they want people to do. Abyss makes better, more engaged pilots.
---
Its like they do not play the game and make shit up.
---
Keep up the good fight.
---
Stay out there in space making space isk, so we have target rich hunting grounds.
---
Napkin math says that 3 t3c and 3 bombers does anywhere from 3,500-5,000 DPS, against the 12 million EHP of a poorfit ratting Nyx or the 25 million of an ok fit Wyvern. It's roughly 2400 seconds to kill a Nyx with that fleet, which is ~40 minutes if the Nyx doesn't do anything besides regen shields, or even shoot back at the attackers. I would think the best comp to kill the Nyx in a realistic timeframe that fits through a hole is either 3 dreads and 3 kikis or a batphone to waffles.
---
Now english isnt my first language and please correct me if Im wrong but the word unassailable means untouchable yes?
---
So why are you presenting numbers that say they were in fact not untouchable prior to the blackout but ending it by saying they were untouchable. I dont get why you are contradicting yourself. They were easily killed before but since its so fking boring to do, few actually bothered. 
---
It kinda says something when that number is so high atm.
---
You hit the problem on the head "the couple non english speaking goons outside the umbrella" largest group in game by a massive margin... only few of them live outside n+9000.
---
I dont have a horse in this race but you are kind of saying you are the problem friendo.
---
Developing a game is hard enough and you want devs to play the game themselves?
---
Give them a break
---
Its a solid conclusion which you have nothing to respond to so you answer in a "funny" way. Great work dude!
---
Hit me up in-game. To go NRDS is to go against the Blue Donut menace.
---
&gt; getting response fleets doesn't happen like they used to for me it's either empty space or cyno up and supers dropped.
---
So you feel like others have felt in Delve for years now?
---
&gt; I firmly believe doing something about supers would help content, but only if you give people back their false sense of security with bringing back local.
---
Something needs to be done about supers for sure.  
---
However, I am getting more content than pre-Blackout so it honestly depends on your play style.  I very rarely FC fleets larger than 20 so I love it.  If I had 100 nerds with me, ya people are going to know about you and dock up until you leave.
---
Another helplessly vague statement about a person’s ability to understand followed by some attempt to be clever about their ability to continue to live.  
---
No substance.  No value.  All waste.
---
epic, simply epic
---
"actively work against your best interests"
---
uh. no.
---
*re*
---
If you go beyond 20 we might not have enough to make it interesting? Idk, I'm on at odd hours. If it starts to get to 30 or 40 we'd probably stay docked up, I'm not sure we could ping that many on short notice.
---
EDIT: Plenty of my corp and alliance mates are solo focused, so our numbers are understandably a littlw lower, but people will usually form for fun stuff. No promises on anything more than kitchen sink fits though
---
The whole point of attribute implants is that they improve your training speed. 
---
The clone loss is a disincentive to PvP. Because it's punishing losing, in the same way that clone upgrades did.
---
Oh that bad ey? Kinda sad, always liked the idea of Provi, execution maybe less but.
---
I'm pretty damn impressed by the speed of these changes damn!
---
Even if you dissembled this thread ... CCP don't care either way :d
---
The alternative is that you comment is so fucking dumb it doesn't warrant a serious reply. On the off chance you truly don't understand what a stupid comment that is, allow me to explain.
---
Saying "They're basically the same so why bother" is assuming the goal was to get kill totals to change. Not only is this an assumption on your part that is likely wrong, because it's such a "surface level" goal, the same logic works the other way around. Since the kills are basically the same, we might as well keep it!
---
But don't you know this man? Hes the official Karmafleet Diplo/Recruiter/Director/WhateverHesGonnaMakeUpNext.
---
Idea is great, CVA just fucks it up. They're too slow to react to changes in the game with byzantine structure.  Which is very Amarrian in itself.  You're not going to overthrow CVA, you'll have to find work arounds.
---
Just give the trig ships the ability to do whatever those defense towers in the abyssals do. -&gt; a wide area damage field effect that kills missiles and drones. (Like a smartbomb but permanent and weak.)
---
&gt; I agree. No local should just be kept in WH’s but that won’t happen. Less people ratting and mining for isk means more people buying plex for isk which is what CCP is after. Just look at the price drop, there’s simply no way it’s just from people no longer botting because they are or people unsubbing.
---
Should we tell him?
---
Monocultures are bad :)
---
Most software developers, at least for free software, think that.
---
You bring up a good point - getting the data and correctly interpreting the data are two entirely different things.  This sounds like when I was working for a big corp and a new SVP in his late 20's (nothing against young upper management mind you) had a town hall and basically said "We're going to throw a bunch of things against the wall and see what sticks".  That's what I took away from the Hilmar interview.
---
I literally mentioned that in the OP but it seems you missed it.
---
You can look it up, but I suspect you want to remain in denial.
---
I personally don't get the hate. If you're low enough SP it's a nice little boost to get you going, if you are high enough that it's a drop in the bucket you can ignore it... It looks to me that most people will complete it on accident just doing other things which seems like the intent.
---
Maybe it's all just a "get people to log in during blackout so we can abuse statistics!" kind of thing, but it's all assuming either way.
---
Yeah. My real world job is my ISK grind.
---
:( But the salty and sweet works! And with pepperoni, you get spicy too! (not very spicy, admittedly)
---
There's no Red vs Blue anymore. They haven't shot at each other for a while, check zkill. It's just Caldari vs Gallente now.
---
Why would both Red and Blue join Caldari? No idea.
---
If they're doing it so they get more people from the larger pool of prospects Caldari has then split later then cool. If not then that's pretty lame.
---
Wolf-Rayet mimic field. Allows groups of cheap destroyers to shred fleets of battle-cruisers.
---
FIRING.
---
SQUAD.
---
the problem is people being forced into the umbrella more so than before, before the blackout the outside of umbrella range of south delve was still wildly active now everyone who has an ounce of sense or speaks english enough to understand what we are doing retreated to the main umbrella space, this is amplified elsewhere where there just isnt enough people out to get subcap fleet fights.
---
The Price of Freedom is Eternal Vigilance - Maverick
---
cyno skill 4 and below is for regular cyno. Don't use that on a BR. cyno 5 grants you access to covert cynos, which I highly recommend.
---
"Please, just leave us alone. Null sec is supposed to be a safe space where I can mine in relative safety. While multiboxxing my 4 super carrier alts in belts making my dank isk. Oh and my 3 titan alts need safety too."
---
"While you're at it CCP, blackout sucks because I have no auto spam d-scan option, making my null sec safe space experience safe again. If you don't agree with these views, survey all other null sec kra... players. They will tell you the same thing, blackout sucks."
---
Depends what you're training.

If you're doing industry, for example, you only need to log one on at a time.

---
Can we at least agree not to go more than medium on a steak?
---
(I prefer medium rare, but I'll accept medium. which is too common when you ask for medium rare)
---
I mostly focus on taking fleets of around 20-40 people around, and could easily bother people enough to get a subcap response fleet to fight, thats died with the death of intel. having intel didnt kill off content you just had to play it. getting rid of the supers would make it so you were able to go into stuff like bloc space and get them to form up subcaps for you rather than lighting the cyno
---
What the fuck is that fit. 2 stabs arent gonna save u from a fleet of bombers.
---
Pot, kettle.
---
Summer 2018 had Legacy vs "all of eve" and the imperium vs gotg &amp; friends. Why do you keep posting like you know anything when you don't know shit?
---
I'm mostly thinking of bringing a corp fleet up, usually averages between 25-35 people provided that isnt too much I'll look out for wormholes that go that way
---
If you're going to do a blackout, do it in the entirety of Eve.....  Instead of fixing broken null, you've simply thrown something out there that will accomplish nothing once players adapt....
---
U want balance in something that isnt made for you.
---
And 5 min delay, loooool. Who is even gonna use them?
---
But they have no other usage. You understand that right? This isnt real world carriers we are talking about. Dude, Im starting to get what you want. You want caps gone. Thats why you are saying these things. Its not about balance, you just dont like them. Tough shit.
---
Shit is stale because players who cant do shit have somehow convinced CCP that they matter. If you combine all the PvP you do in a month its still nowhere close to the destruction NS does in a matter of days. Get that into your head. We send out more fleets/day that I can count and they fight similar fleets. You think small gang even matters?
---
They dont. Thats entitlement and being a snowflake. 
---
Shit is stale because we cant fight more. Its because of fozziesov, because of cynojammers, because of the endless fking timers. Thats why the game is stale, its tedious to fight atm. Everyone knows this dude, try actually fighting on a large scale and you would know 2.
---
But instead of fixing these things we are instead forcing people to be defensive making it even more stale. 
---
Dude, honestly. I dont think youre gonna get this.
---
:doubt:
---
&gt;Ratting/Mining is more fun in groups with defense online.
---
Yes, I too love having to split my meager sub-cap ratting ticks with a half dozen other players. Spending 6 hours ratting for every hour before the blackout makes me super happy.
---
Been doing 'Skilling Spree' on two low SP alts.
---
One has gotten nothing but 10k.
---
The other has gotten 50k twice.  Of course it is not the alt most in need of SP.
---
There were reasons why "recurring opportunities" were trashed.
---
You sure dunked on me with that very specific knowledge for thinking the context of the discussion and what happened would have been enough to not have to be so specific. 
---
Now that i know how you feel i won't bother next time.
---
Sounds like someone's bitter.
---
So the umbrella now exists cause of the blackout? 
---
Sounds like the umbrella got slightly bigger. Once again no horse in the race but the umbrella seems like while it is highly intelligent from a winning standpoint... the true source of the problem.
---
The panic module was a mistake. 
---
So was letting rorquals mine, but both can be true.
---
You sound like one of those guys who gets super mad when his girlfriend meets up with a friend she knew before she met you.
---
Either you added that or you intentionally tucked away in fine print the most important detail that undoes your whole argument.
---
Can you run a T-test on the data?
---
10k 4 days in a row now
---
In this matter, you and I appear to be in agreement. I don’t really give a damn about the killboard, I just want to have fun and avoid small-minded twats like the ones you’re talking about.
---
see you whenever any of your structures get rf'd. with love: blue donut

We are talking in regards to kills. You have read the OP right? If it falls short or remains the same then its now longer viable. And since all you elite PvPers have been screaming that PvP is up and the numbers turn up short then...
---
But I see what the issue is here. You guys have been lying since day 1 about its positive effects, data doesnt support your lies and youre just jumping to something new to lie about, hence "assuming goals". Mofo, these have been your assumptions, your lies.
---
Its kinda sad to see honestly. But I am curious about the next lie youre gonna use as pro no local argument.
---
Use the old map to find active systems. Its not rocket science.
---
Same reason you do it appears
---
Bad stats are already taking over science, we don't them taking over eve too.  I can make stats do whatever the fuck you want.  Using your metric, July 2017 was just as good as 2019:
---
July 2017 - July 2019 Delta  
---
NS: -3,923  
---
July 2016 - July 2019 Delta  
---
NS: +15,318  
---
July 2015 - July 2019 Delta  
---
NS: +40,457
---
July 2012 - July 2019 Delta  
---
NS: +34,283  
---
July 2010 - July 2019 Delta  
---
NS: +75,474  
---
If you think the raw quantity of null sec kills means anything, you are delusional.  
---
But the glory days of PEAK PCU GUISE, WE WERE ALL RAOMING IN NULLSEX AND KILLING ALL THE THINGS.  
---
Funny the stats do not agree.
---
Also what happened to hunting being so hard that carriers and rorqual need nerfs because 'nothing ever dies' in nullsec and 'they all warp off right away'.  The stats show nullsec ship kills are up when PCU is down, maybe they are inversely correlated and all your hunter whining bullshit is hurting the game?
---
Ishukone: What are you?

Kimotoro Eskeitan: I'm you, but better.

and that is new and interesting to me. I have only been playing a week or so but it seems like I am already running out of things to do that feel like any progress is being made. sure I can go omega and Im ok with that but I kind of hoped to get sucked in more. mmos are obviously different than most genres but they still usually have a bit more going on / to look forward to even early on.
---
I will look into your healbot suggestion. that actually sounds more interesting to me than a lot of the other alpha roles. the sending in waves of basically useless ships to clutter someone to death (maybe) in pvp sounds unimaginably boring.
---
not to sound all negative. i knew what i signed up for to a degree. i just find all the alpha talk to be make their roles sound very sugar coated. i can go omega at any time though :)
---
&gt; I lit my bombs podding my 1 bill snake set.  We all proceeded to piss ourselves laughing on comms.
---
... and that right there, ladies and gentleman, is what we call a genuine 'Eve Player':  accepting loss, laughing at it, and with friends.
---
No one made you gate camp. Go out and find content. It's not impossible we do it every day, you're just bad at it.
---
Hmm ye felt like that. Used to live there for a spell and its very much the way you explain it. Could never get my head around it. Maybe thats the charm? Idk. But it has always been a great intro to NS, sad if that part dies.
---
&gt;no u  
---
So you're just madpostimg without substance, got it
---
but he deployed to tribute to fight with NC ! hes obviously qualified /s
---
&gt;So the umbrella now exists cause of the blackout?
---
This is not what I was saying please don't misrepresent me.  
---
&gt; the umbrella seems like while it is highly intelligent from a winning standpoint... the true source of the problem. 
---
This is more of what I AM saying, but it's not fixed via the blackout that's only doubled down on it.
---
So the only people you see represents all of new eden?
---
I’m not madposting?  I’ve given plenty of substance you just choose to ignore it
---
Do people expect them to know how the game actually works?
---
The kill total is one metric, of many, that is available. My entire stance on it is no one has the data but CCP so everyone's opinion is bullshit. Im not here to sell you on no-local, I dont give a fuck if you enjoy it lol
---
(OP is in TEST)
---
You're proving time and time again that you have literally no idea what you're talking about.
---
I think he refit partially as we didn't notice the mobile depot for a few seconds. He might have been going for a full rack (that would also not save him)
---
In what way?  It’s pretty easy to just throw that shit out without substance
---
oh right i forgot how silly of me
---
Thanks for the fit.
---
Detorid has become such a wasteland. I mean the bots were bad but atleast there was something. And always that carrier who messes up and tries to tether with his fighters out or that dread that tries to kill the cyno inhib.
---
Now its just dead outside of few semi active systems.
---
I don't think the tax increase will have a significant impact.
---
It would have been more effective to reduce NPC bounties.  Slashing them by 10% minimum would have been a good start.
---
I'm guessing CCP didn't do that because tax is a single database record change.
---
I have not edited the OP at all, you can check for yourself. I acknowledged the flaw in the Dotlan data including NPCs deaths in the OP. Which is why I then used Zkillboard stats which were the same stats used from the original post I was responding to. I then acknowledged the flaws in the Zkillboard data too. 
---
&gt;Now the Dotlan statistics obviously just blanket include all deaths that have ever happened, including those to NPCs. Let's take a look at the Zkill Data which I believe is the source of the OP. Obviously [Zkillboard.com](https://zkillboard.com/) is also a flawed information source since it only shows kills from where either one of the both parties involved have a verified ESI key.  
---
&gt;**ALL Nullsec PVP kills as per** [**Zkillboard.com**](https://zkillboard.com/)  
---
July 2019: 206,419  
---
July 2018: 200,325  
---
&gt;According to verified deaths on [zkillboard.com](https://zkillboard.com/) PVP kills increases by over 3% during blackout.  
---
&gt;The key information that the OP neglected is that he compared all zkillboard deaths from every region in the game (including highsec and lowsec, which as shown in the dotlan data, did decline). It seems that Blackout has increased the amount of PVP kills in nullsec anywhere from 3 to 9% depending on how much of the dotlan kills you think can be attributed to PVE deaths.
---
:salt:
---
HAHAHA Goonies crying. Whats new. Road map is Null is chaos.
---
This. A lulled NS was always going to be far better for roaming than a vigilant one.
---
It's boring... new meta is all about covert ops cloaking...
---
Also citadel timer mechanics, fix those so one can create content and not just have ever final timer  on a weekday in the middle of the other guys work days. 
---
You know how it was with stront timers...
---
Ok, let me spell it out for you: T H E R E  H A V E  B E E N  2  B I G  W A R S  L A S T  S U M M E R
---
100mn, scram, disupt, battery, pulse legion is popular to run.
---
I don't think your argument fully addresses it since Zkillboard also has kills by NPC which it didn't have last year. So the Zkill null numbers would include everyone who died to Drifters in July.
---
WH jumps don't count, and the only ones who seem to give a fuck about this blackout are wh chodes who hunt in nullsec and whine about how much effort their easy mode teleportation is.
---
&gt;I'll have to respectfully disagree with every single point you've made in these three paragraphs.
---
That's the great thing here, we can disagree, however, in my capacity, it is unlikely I will have any effect on Eve, in yours, its possible it will do. 
---
&gt;Feel free to dredge up T20 - I was on the other side of the fence as an angry player when that happened. Completely different company now, completely different people. Your point is entirely moot. Correct, it was a shitshow, and it was dealt with when it happened way back in the day. You screw around like that at CCP these days, you're out of the door. It's as simple as that. I get accused of being biased on a daily basis, and of being a cheater. One day I'm being accused of being biased toward PL, the next day it's GSF. Life goes on. 
---
I did not point at a single block, I pointed at a game-play-style. Feel free to try and conflate the two, however, it would be disingenuous to do so. 
---
&gt;On your point about soundbytes - news flash - anyone who knows me knows that I don't pander. If I have something to say, I say it. I don't give a shit what "demographic" it plays well with - if I have an opinion on the game as a 17 year veteran of it, I'll be sure to express it, both externally to the community, and internally at CCP. Admittedly that's caused friction internally too at times - even recently when I've been vocal about my views, but that's what makes CCP great - we're encouraged to talk about our products and what we like and dislike about them. Sue me for having an opinion and wanting something that I think is for the betterment of the game. I don't pander - everyone is equal in my eyes and I don't care for politics. 
---
I wish I could trust those words, I do not know you personally, so I cannot weigh your words with your actions, however, given the type of job you do, and my interaction with numerous CMs over the years, I will take what you say with a pinch of salt. You are doing a job, that job holds you to certain standards, although it seems that those standards are somewhat slipping, and this is not a personal attack here, so please hear me out, and this is further backed up by your comments on reddit and your further points in the above post. 
---
&gt;My job as a community manager is to communicate, correct, but it's not to stand by and watch us sit on our balls if I can help prevent that by giving solid feedback from our players. That's my job. Whether that feedback is listened to is at the behest of people above my pay grade, but I make sure that voices are heard - that's what I do. That's what all community managers do. We're the front line support for dealing with player sentiment, **regardless of whether we agree with it or not**. 
---
Your job as a community manager is to represent all voices within eve, whether you agree with them or not. Voicing your personal preference not only waters down that representation, it brings it into question as to how well you can represent those you simply don't agree with. We all think we are able to walk the line, hold truth to power, make sure we uphold the views of others even if we disagree with them, but we cant. It's one of the fundamental flaws of human beings. We are complex, innately selfish and self-serving. You may believe you represent the views of a huge swathe of people in eve, but I can guarantee without ever meeting you that you probably represent the views you agree with more, and with more vehemence and desire. This isn't even something any of us need to question, it is simply how we work. Which is why I have an issue with you placing your view in public light because not only does it give other players a green light to attack those of an opposite view, it basically makes them assume its ok for them to do so, because they are "right", when in reality, they are not, it's simply a view. Look at the hate, vitriol, cancel your account and so on responses to this thread, simply for airing an opinion. It's disgusting to say the least. 
---
&gt;On your point about a bitter and twisted rage fest, one of the best quotes I've ever heard from a player was printed in the "Into the second decade" book that we published on the 10th anniversary. It read "Mark my words, this game will be dead in six months.". 
---
These two things are not compatible, see above for my points regarding twisted rage fests, it was not with regards to the game dying, but the game becoming far more vitriolic, poisonous and hate filled, which lays at your feet for emboldening people who think they are "elite pvpers" with the idea you are on their side and what they are doing is ok. It's not.  
---
&gt;That was a quote from 2003, yet here we are. EVE has been "dying" and "declining" since it was conceived in the eyes of everyone who doesn't like the changes that are made to it. People come and go, opinions change, but the people who stick around are those core pillars of our community who realise what the objective is for New Eden. 
---
The year on year trend within eve is with less players. I don't  want eve to die, I want massive battles with insane numbers and territorial wars happening all across new eden, I want to see the massive fights that make news headlines and other MMO players look at the game in awe, you simply advocate a band-aid that is stuck on a bruise, as opposed to the gaping wound that is pissing out blood. (The band aid is the blackout). 
---
&gt;Sorry mate, but the three step approach of trying to shame me about history - which was set right years ago, trying to tell me how to do my job, then trying to shame the community because they're excited and debating changes that are happening to the game doesn't fly with me. 
---
There is no approach in trying to shame you, nor the community. If you think excited debate is what has happened in this thread, or others, then I despair at what you think hateful comments are. Eve has become far more toxic than I have seen since I started playing, you have engendered the play-style vs play-style toxicity with airing your own views enabling people to become even more toxic because they think they are on the right side of a debate, with a CCP employee. I would caution your future words in this regard, and also ask that you reflect on your ability to draw on play-styles you may not agree with. All play-styles make eve go around, apart from bots of course, but every player has a place in eve, whether that is PvE or PvP. I don't expect eve to be fair, forgiving or easy, however, I expect an employee of CCP to be all of the above and take into account that their preferences are not the same as what the community wants or needs. Most of the community would turn this game into a shit-fest within a matter of weeks if they had control of it. 
---
Essentially, the blackout does not fix anything, nothing at all, it has simply given players excitement because eve, of late, has been boring as shit. That is the players fault, but also CCPs. Creating chaos, turning the game upside down is not going to fix any of the above, it will simply push new players away and annoy cemented players already enjoying the game, in addition, forcing those players to join the umbrellas and thus, create more stagnation. CCP needs to focus on the core aspect that is causing stagnation, capitals, cyno mechanics, sov mechanics, the point of owning space. Putting fluff into the game won't fix any of these, removing local won't fix any of these. 
---
I make this post with the utmost respect, I hope it is received as such.
---
Well it isn't the same place it was before that for sure. The reason for that is adapt or die in EvE. Name one thing that has stayed the same and survived! Game changes every patch. Fair fights and High sec is not what the average pilots wants now in EvE.  
---
The old style RvB is available sadly not a lot of people want to use it now a days because losing stuff is not the meta just now. Pilots just want to inject skills and win fights.   
---
Once we get numbers back to a good stage then we can try the old school brawls again but till then we shall be a purple horde of fun and games!
---
Which has been used to death as an argument for no local. Dont pretend otherwise. Now when its not in your favor you dont wanna admit something might be wrong.
---
But its cool. Keep fighting the good fight.
---
My original post here was a fucking question... hence the question mark asking to know if the timing was the same.  
---
You are fucking retarded.
---
Yeah go fuck yourself actually re reading this. Mad posting is literally you.
---
If you mean dudes living in wh space with 300bn+ in networth and 50bn+ liquid isk sure.
---
It helps to frame bullshit arguments in the stench of the person who makes it.
---
Blackout has not fixed bots. If you think they have, you need to open your eyes. You simply cannot see them because there is no local.
---
Life must be *super* hard when you're this dumb.
---
&gt; getting rid of the supers would make it so you were able to go into stuff like bloc space and get them to form up subcaps for you rather than lighting the cyno
---
I mean I'd let my corp blow up my Hel if it meant CCP would hit supers with a nerf bat.
---
Your posting made me log out
---
The problem here is that /u/CCP_Falcon has helped create this situation where people have become so polarised towards the blackout, because of his views. Any dissenting views are not tolerated and attacked, simply look at the responses to this post.
---
I started in a wormhole as a newish player and brought a handful of noobies with me. I don't have all the answers but I can relay to you what I did learn from about 9 months in wormholes.
---
It's hard to tell how hot a system is (say if your trying to find a place to make a home) checking zkill for that w-space is a good tip-off, look for reoccurring names or corporations. Although this isnt fool-proof.
---
Systems that have access to a c-3 and HS are ideal, however, I find that those systems are usually the hottest ones and sometimes occupied.  Being able to collapse your c3 is a great way to make money via sleepers. Get a good wormhole to a c3, scan down the entire system (check dscan for activity during this time),  Find out how many wormholes lead to the system you'd like to farm. The fewer the better, as you are less likely to get hit by roaming wormhole gangs. Sometimes our gang would find a c3 with a ton of combat sites, so we'd collapse all the wormholes in that system to make it safer for a hour or two while we clear the sites.
---
Relic/data sites are also abundant and a good source of income as well. If you've spent time in a system killing sleepers, you might as well do all data/relic while its safe.
---
For your initial operation, i'd suggest buying a rather small control tower + base. This will be a cheap way to set up a temporary home in a system. My guys would do this for about a week to farm / scout a potential system for a permanent home. If its been pretty quiet for a week, it may be time to set down your citadel. (or if your rich and or ballsy, just start with the citadel).
---
How to deal with sleepers can be its own post, they are very strong NPCs but pay well. Consider bringing at least 2-3 other people if you plan to regularly do sleepers. Safety in numbers.
---
If you have any questions, PM me and we can figure it out
---
What about the ganks where NPCs got final blows? Does this day neglect excavators? Fighters? You are manipulating data to support a severely flawed narrative.
---
I dont recognize you or your flair. Sad times.

Dear /u/CCP_Falcon \- this is not a debate, it's turning into something far more sinister with debate being completely shut down by those who you have helped to rile up into a frenzy over the blackout.

Dude, he was arguing the other day that titans should be alphad by subcap fleets. And that it wouldnt affect things if they were nerfed in that sense. Hes got issues man.

Not really. Im good:)

In aggressive non jita markets a 1% drop per undercut wouldn't do anymore damage than the guy fire sale his hanger, using the split buy/sell price and then have clueless people come in and .01 ISK that guy. People regularly come in, sell fuel for 20% off and that's the new price for a week.

By "MASS-REEEEE" you mean a post by Seddow right after you failed to accomplish an important strategic objective, not because guns were split, but because you sat in station for almost 2 hours and didn't make it to the timer before it repaired.

You guys need to stop being retarded and realize you're being blamed for mistakes that are meaningless only as a distraction from the complete incompetence of Military leadership.

I’m really not I’ve been stratios roaming and frat killing in detorid.  Running JF instead of rorqual mining.

My main frustrations are how short sighted and unoriginal the whole blackout has been.  
---
Seeing lesser activity statistics is just concerning.  
---
I know you’re reeling here a bit cause you’re out of line and trying to pivot to a line that gives you some element of comfort in attacking blackout haters.
---
Why are people so fucking bad at making memes on this sub?
---
Also for those who care, someone already put together some historical stats if you want some compairson to avoid the OP's bias:

---
Of course. They made my preferred way of ISK making so unprofitable that it's literally not worth doing anymore. I'm justifiably salty about this.
---
But that's fine. I've simply changed to another way of ISK making. One that requires only 1 account, and doesn't provide anybody any targets to shoot at. - It's not as good as the old ratting, but far better than the current ratting. And I'm saving money not subbing my 4 alt accounts, so there's a silver lining there.
---
Is unallocated SP static? Does it provide the same amount of skill progress for alpha and gamma clones when spend on skills?
---
Well put. I mean this sub got super hyped right after he wrote his ideas for the "new" Eve and then that interview, I mean one could hear the contempt in their voices. It was screaming "BURN NS, you mofos are whats wrong with Eve". And not once did they acknowledge that they implemented things we didnt want but did the best with resulting in what we told them would happen.
---
Yet its still our fault. 
---
Honestly, no matter how this turns out, CCP lost alot of goodwill due to their handling of this.
---
The raw quantity of null sec kills was the metric that was used by the OP I was responding to. This is a response to that original post. I am not saying it is the 'best' metric, I didn't choose it, I am merely using the same dataset to refute the OP. You're right that July 2017 was better than July 2019. July 2017 had a 3k higher PCU on average though so there was a much higher population difference than between July 2018 and July 2019. It is also possible that kills alone isn't a good metric.
---
I'm not sure why you're including the historical nullsec data deltas? Yes they are massively up from 2010+ but the population of nullsec was vastly reduced then. Obviously when the nullsec population is 2/3rds of what it is now, the number of kills are going to be down. The population in nullsec has increased heavily from 2015-2017 onwards as Karmafleet/Pandemic Horde/Brave Newbies formed, and overtime the 'recruit anything' attitude instead of 'selective recruitment' took over nullsec alliances, Citadels, Super Umbrellas and Rorquals were introduced into the game, the safety and rewards being vastly increased attracted many empire players over to null. The shift in attitude also is quite apparent, there were far fewer players in nullsec back then, but a higher population of them were willing to fight for their space. Seems like a weak way to try and discredit kills as a metric instead of arguing more lucid points.  
---
I personally think that PVP kills per jump would probably be a better metric because it shows how many people live in nullsec through 'jumps' as well as how many jumps players must do to get a kill.
---

^  seriously. Tengu is pretty fun.   even with ECM nerfed to hell. its a solid platform.   tinker, hybrid, missiles.   one of my favorite still
---
idk but mystical might shows up every now and then, not much of a threat
---
All of this is ontop of the fact that almost half of nullsec is currently not under well established ownership or has had major forces only recently starting to move in. Which also results in less activity in those regions.
---
It's the ivory tower syndrome we have seen for years simply rearing its ugly head once again. I despair.
---
Shh not in front of Seddow!
---
I won’t be renewing my accounts. I’m not salty about Blackout, I just don’t enjoy 24/7 Blackout.  I’ll come back if there is some sort of middle ground reached because I do enjoy some aspects of it. I hope EvE does well, though, regardless.
---
NPC kills are not included in the statistics. They are 'unlisted'.
---
This was a triumph
---
Dude, even if this was the case shit would still get alphad. Its not like they can dock or something.

I really don't understand the attraction of WoW Classic.

I played WoW back when it was classic.  About the only thing I remember as 'fun' was doing 40-man raids on what became 10-man and are now 5-man instances (there wasn't a limit), like Baron (Stratholme) and Scholomance.
---
Getting attuned to MC and Onyxia was a PITA.  I remember when the whole raid used the 'back-door' to MC, in Blackrock Depths.
---
Ye.
---
That uses the same data-set from eve-maps that I'm using. It only goes up to 2018 though so I'm not really sure how it's going to "avoid my bias". 
---
Interesting that 2017 had 25% more kills in nullsec than 2018 though, makes the July 2017 to 2019 comparison a lot stronger for the July 2019 one.

But but, Vily lied!

According to CCP the reason why all the ships in the trailers are shitfit is that they pick modules based on how the icon looks rather than what they do. It definitely explains a lot, because I haven’t even seen one good fit in a trailer.

---
Or just someone sitting in fleet watching broadcasts

There’s more kills per person but fewer people playing, which isn’t good for CCP

If there was a way to see unique players and kills each month then compare player/kills, I think that would be a useful stat.

If you were used to hunting via blue eyes, shotgunning next door with a small fleet etc and catching botters/the odd actual player, well blackout has seen to the end of that.
---
I don’t think CCP should be catering to the nullbloc meta anyway, this is the kind of content that’s driven stagnation in eve over the past few years and it’s good they’re shaking things up.
---
I powered through the end of capital auto spec 5
---
A quick calculation revealed that the 10000 reward equals to 58 mill for a high SP player, progressively less for lower SP players(prices compared to skill injectors). So high SP players gain more for killing a single rat.
---
Still, it does feel like WoW dailies to me, which I hated but still finished to remain on par with the rest. I wish they had found something more engaging...
---
If there was a way to basically take the type of system used on https://mutaplasmid.space and make a market where you could set attribute sliders to show you whats listed on market in those stat categories for whatever.

I'm sure you are fine with people referring to you by the name of some body else

I helped run a corp PI buy-back program.
---
We paid Jita prices to members for P1, way out in nulsec, gave 50% of the profits to the corp, and still turned a considerable profit for those running the program.
---
We even bought PI stuff from other corps in the region, and even the adjacent region.  Lost a couple of freighters gateing it 'home', and still profited.

Anyone looking for efficiency who can afford it and is smart enough to realize that this is a hobby and yes you can spend money on your fucking hobby, looks no further than using real money.

Is there anyway to know if people are running missions in particular systems? I've heard of people talking about this, but I don't know where the hubs of mission runners are.

Thanks.

Fair point.

Wait for asset safety changes, that'll do the trick and Perimeter will be a very busy system.

Market trading is one of my primary income sources. Yet I agree with the idea. Shake it up

Why are you don’t making memes, if you’re so strong???
---
more insidiously, and all this can only be done because frat list their doctrine shit on public contract, they have also been seeding improperly fit doctrine ships at reasonable prices, dps munin with frigate sized mwd, or scimitar with improperly sized reps or whatever.
---
I don't understand the fine workings of ticks usually, but this won't always work right? A neut could go off between the nos and the scram, totally emptying the poor little ceptors cap, and turn off the scram before the next nos cycle, right?
---
But I guess it'd be pretty uncommon that one of the curses neuts sticks in that short window and he's also aligned and spamming warp and not otherwise tackled so he can get out before another of the fast small nos cycles goes (without a curse neut also coming in) and scram is reapplied.
---
&gt; *Truly shocking that people who don't like Blackout would misrepresent  statistics in a way that makes them seem both correct and credible.* 
---
The fucking irony of this lmao.
---
Hahaha what do you do? Show up and drop off a plex in their citadel? (Like how pvpers asset safety loot) Then public contract it?
---
&gt; throwing shit against the wall to see what sticks.

I’m glad he has so many posts here for me to downvote.

I think it is worth pointing out to the Opie then it is best to train skills in batches of the lowest training time to the longest. It is a lot more beneficial to train six of these skills to level three then train one of these skills to level four.
---
Uhm, i can see the other comments you're making, your name is on them you know? &gt;.&gt;
---
I am the best poster but am happy to entertain other reasons. I'd rather people didn't remember me but extractors are too expensive and voice changers are unreliable.

his statistical analysis is severely flawed

I would think that someone made a mistake. I would not go on to assume that person was a moron for making that mistake unless they reaffirmed the fact that they were a moron.
---
Lmao.

The quality of fights has gone way up. Even if kills fell by 30%, I'd still be in favor of keeping it forever.

I mean, if she is hooking up with him after I put a ring on it, I think I would have every right to be mad.

they aren't people either

Why is it ironic? It's not to say this post is without any bias, but it's at least explained, reasoned through, and comparing apples to apples. Doesn't mean you have to agree with it
---
Gate camps are boring and stupid content that’s not usually fun for either side. Wish they’d spend some time making that more fun or something...

Goteem. Wait till asset recovery gets removed ;)

You could, but if he thinks that it’s not like he’d understand anyways.

That's actually how I fit all my ships too! Gotta look Gucci after all.
---
Lol nice dato I know you got my asklepians the other day with that strateos too
---
Allrite mate keep dreaming on.
---
Yes it can, however the bombs are weaker due to lack of powergrid and I am running a cheaper fit, so you can't kill noobships in one cycle.
---
That's a lot of modules for what appears to be a pods worth of capacitor lol.

I've had this happen with 3.2b askleps

Well luckily the trailer is meant for potential players rather than all you bittervets so it don’t really matter and it does it’s job.

Interesting metric actually. July 2019 has a much lower of ratio of jumps to kills as the entirety of 2019 and 2018, and infact it hasn't been as low since 2015. So players have to roam less to get kills.
---
Layout looks like it might be a Cheetah. Cap on those things is pretty limited.
---
I guess if the fort have rigs goons will gladly buy it from INIT.
---
They were always worthless, that's not new.

Yes it should

I mean really, when was the last successful campaign by elos band of useless smug pricks?  Also, wheres elo?  Did he burn out after getting regularly beaten by tests 5th or 6th best fc for months?
---
Save yourself fellow Reddit warrior, the spod has corrupted this man beyond saving. We must accept this casuality of the Carebear Era and spread our gospel of actual facts and logic where it may help.
---
Uh idk about the "the nullsec status quo" part. Literally everyone I've talked to in nullsec likes the blackout and things being shaken up. I know only know 1 player personally who quit because of it.
---
I do agree that most people disliked the drifter invasion since it was just a terrible implementation
---
Elaborate instead of assuming
---
Man if only they could sell their coalition ships in a way that didn’t require public contacts yet was still secure to their blue list....
---
&gt;i clicked on this being confused about HOW do you smartbomb your OWN pod. 
---
Ghostriding.
---
he's basing this conclusion off of severely skewed data which is literally misrepresenting the statistics in a way that makes them seem both correct and credible = the irony part.
---
Fighters, Excavators, and NPC kills don't count as people - you can't use "kills" alone to prove a point, that's called cherry picking.
---
Thats someone showing off that function-modeling in math in school wasn't wasted after all. Thank you kind sir
---
Yeah it’s just too bad there’s not a clean way to really isolate the effects of blackout.  July was affected by drifters too.  I realize you try to account for some of the noise in dotlan by using zkill and the increase is substantially less than the dotlan #.  
---
Overall taken in context the publicly available player activity is lesser than this same time last year or the prior period of this year.  Eve-offline, dotlan, etc all point to overall less jumps less deaths (in total) less less less.   
---
Yes 0.0 saw some uptick related to bots being killed and they’re not being logged in.  Space feeing more empty outside the umbrella regions.  We do need more data as you said earlier.  
---
But to come here proclaiming victory over the “trolls with biased data” is hypocritical of you doing the same thing.
---
hey bb r u a maulus cuz dat setup looks damp     
---
mmmmm^^moist
---
Again we return to the discrepancy between what *you* think the relationship between goons and INIT should be and what the leadership of those groups are content for it to be.
---
tig if brue

Yeah sure whatever.
---
Yes maintain trolling narrative at all costs!  Threat level spodbrain!!

Go ahead and read the OPs last paragraph. And yes I would agree that using one data point to justify a claim would be stupid.

Yeah but I have more friends who have varying interests

I'm not sure I'd trust CCP to develop any other system that involves rounding.
---
So 750dps should be pretty easy then.
---
Generally, in your DSCAN if you see lots of NPC wrecks, with typical mission ships (Marauders, Rattlesnake or Machariel), you might have found someone chaining missions. Looking out for MTUs is also a good way to spot one.
---
I can’t really say about mission hubs, but generally lots of people run missions near Jita as the way back to sell whatever they loot or salvage from their missions is short.

You should fly riskier, man.

According to the Covert Jump Portal Generator module’s stats, nothing is said about aggression timer or mass addition. However, when the portal is up you get a -100% velocity bonus, which mean you’re completely static (a bit like a siege module’s mass multiplier).
---
If it caused an aggression timer, you wouldn’t be able to use it in highsec as CONCORD would come to blast your ass.
---
No, already uninstalled the client and I might use it again someday
---
CCP has more data available to them than we do (or at least they should).

OP edited the post

Woah easy with that rational talk shit the echo chamber will come down hard
---
I have a question, I only just started worrying about ( you will see why).
---
When I open my wallet on my (toon parked in HS hub, call him Abe), it says my base brokering fee is 3%
---
When I open and look at the same screen on my Null toon (call him Ben), it says 2%
---
Now, post patch, those numbers have not changed.  It can't be skills because Abe has broker relations 5 (but he does have shit standings, like 0.0 in his station) 
---
Does your region of space change what displays here?
---
I picked the wrong day to quit sniffing glue.
---
You didnt post the fit?
---
Speaking from experience with the harbinger Navy which only gets a 7.5% tracking bonus when the new vni gets 10% per level, this is highly possible to make rail track. With javelin ammo and a TC since 4 mids, well you can play with them to make it work. I actually see this as a cetpor killer like the Harb navy I mentioned. Heavy pulse lasers Can kill a 5km/s 20km ceptor in a shot or 2 depending on make and tank. Beams also hit very nicely but naturally not as well but still sufficient.
---
As for the toxicity and the interest of "educating" me, you can kindly fuck off. Specifically since you don't even seem to want to experiment but would rather wallow at the bottom of a subreddit feed because you don't like change. Go to the test server with a friend if you have one and test some fits. Otherwise use a different ship. I honestly don't get what the problem is.
---
Either way, thanks for making me take a closer look at this ship. Looks awesome with that tracking bonus. I'm buying one when I get home.
---

If its empty it’d be nice if a new group could move in.  They’re empty due to a mix of entrenched alliances holding empty space as buffers/epeen, and the logistics of getting into sov null without help being more work than its worth.

That’s actually really clever, I never would have considered that happening.

Goons must want another renter region and threatened an ugly eviction and rather than present even a hint of being a goon pet they put up a good narrative.

---
Except even if you don't agree with them, having in the game would be better than having an empty game. A change like this might not matter to a billionaire, but someone starting out sure doesn't need even less income.
---
Yes.  The difference between alpha and omega is the rate at which you get SP while training.  The actual number of points required to learn a skill (and thus unallocated SP) is the same.
---
Main thing I'd like to have is stats showing ships used, like X kills with Taranis, Y kills with Dominix etc. Eve-kill had I think top 10 ships and weapons used - weapons being kinda meaningless since killmails show basically whatever in that regard.  I may be in the minority but I like having stuff like that. zkill does actually show ships used for the last 7 days, but at least I haven't found a "career" stat for that.
---
Also zkill can for example list all the kills you've done with a certain ship type, which eve-kill didn't have and which is great to have... but stupidly it is not integrated into the site's UI itself so you have to use an external site for it or manipulate the url yourself. Go figure.
---
Lol me getting elected plus CCP raining down on carebears really turned you into the village idiot.
---
Go create more blackout rage threads. You're not worth my time.
---
not really because a lot of jumps could be guys doing pve stuff or going to trade hubs.    Although that would be an awesome metric to use if not for the above
---
Back to deepspace probes? :)
---
https://youtu.be/9sNL3JcjG6g
---
That is not what happened there though. ;) That Leshak was on field 20 minutes into the fight. 1 hour before the Apostle went down. That was just plain old reshipping after he lost the Bhaal ;)
---
boy are our spies slow
---
While we're being speculative, CCP could increase rewards to match the change in risk, like buffing combat signatures so there's more farmers spread out. As a result there would be more hunters, who could then also fight each other. Just need to make sure that the rewards don't further incentivize megablobs.
---
So if I understand this correctly...  A char with max skills and good standing should see their fees drop in 4-4?

"While the author doesn't post a conclusion or his opinion, by viewing  his posting history and the tone of the post, it's clear that he is  sympathetic towards the nullsec status quo and believes that blackout is  a bad thing, disliked the drifters and doesn't like the new 'chaos era'  of eve. His post contains the following."
---
I have not been on Reddit in over a year, until today, due to a military deployment to the Middle East. Just getting back into the game few days before blackout was announced. Haven't made post on /r/eve closer to two years. Going to temporary duty assignments to get trained on things critcal my units deployment and then trying to enjoy the real life at home before leaving for a year.  I am not sympathetic with the NullSec status quo, thats why I am NRDS in Providence for years cause I'm sick of the blue donut. I figure NRDS in Providence is a counter culture way to do Sov Null.  Didn't express any dislike over the drifters.  Only mention them once or twice as something that caused NullBlocs to blue up even more prior to me getting back into the game by a day or two.  Only thing I said about Black Out is if the numbers are down CCP needs to fine tune it.
---
I posted without conclusion or opinion in the OP because I wanted to see what the community thought and could do with the numbers. Not really to troll.  Not really my thing. I generally stay away from /r/eve, but seem best best place to get feedback.  Which is more than you're going to get from CCP. Apparently CSM doesnt have access to DAU/MAU.
---
On the PSA: Market Tax Change post.  I posted
---
"PSA:You are all now water down renters of Goon Horde Please Ignore.  Ftfy
---
NPC Tax=Freedom Tax"
---
Which I will gladly pay the Freedom Tax to not be a water down renter of Goon Horde Please Ignore.
---
"So the total number of kills in Nullsec in the Blackout, despite some  players not logging in, despite people claiming that people stopped  logging in/space is empty - has increased by over 24 thousand."  All I got from this was LowSec empty out to take advantage of the initial hype of Blackout which will be an outlier. Nor would I say NullSec or the game is more vibrant due LowSec emptying out to NullSec in the short run. and Empires numbers did not go up with NullSec refugees or NullSec blocs fighting as much over HighSecs stations that they are now spliting 3 ways now. Zkill isn't flawed its large to serve as solid sample size for measuring kills.  You can't look at NullSec without whats happen in Empire due to things like burn Jita, NullSec own Trade Hubs in Empire, and now possible NullSec refugees or exiles.  While numbers are up in one area of the game overall they are down. With less wars, and more blue donuting.  Making the game less Vibrant.  Taking people who are subbing and unsubbing at their word and trying to avoid the Vampire Paradox. Which could cause the game to dry out and cause a net loss in players.  Blackout hasn't affect my money making at all.  Turns out people are too lazy to do the big AU probes spreads for abyssal deadspace sigs if they do not see you in local.

I think it would be fair to have this pinned.

Implying Star Citizen will ever reach beta.

so where is the important info??????
---
Quit licking suitonias chode.  He’s doing the same fucking thing as he’s claiming the other guy did but the crime is suitonia uses his CSM tag and attributed knowledge as if to give further weight to his side.

Really ugly if you ask me.  Has jintan posted anything on this topic?
---
I miss the "Pirate War of 9UY4-H" in 2006 :(
---
That sounds scary, where was this?
---
How do you know it's the "Vast Majority" of your Corp that likes the blackout? 
---
As someone in a HR capacity, I'm seeing increased activity among the most active members, who love the blackout, but the average person's activity is down and the casual members just barely login anymore.
---
In other words,  it's the loud minority of people whining on /r/eve that like the change, to the detriment of literally everyone else.
---
I wonder if zkill can be parsed to look at characters with kills/deaths in both time periods?  Try to ask them if they’re doing more/less of what they were doing?  
---
Ya know... work?
---
this guy knows wazzup
---
Dunno any about that.
---
We should have been ready to accept the blackout just because how much of the faucets it cuts away.
---
If it decreases faucets, yet increases kills, yet logs off bots, yet keeps the playercount stable, there is literally no downside to this thing. All the fuss was about nullseccers growing so entitled to unquestioned mechanics. 
---
This should be followed by changes in cynoes, asset safety and capitals. Null linemembers will still moan about it (btw, null leaders are much more sensible about all this, it's just the linemembers), but it'll be good for them as well. When the risk is sufficiently increased, we can talk about increasing rewards to wormhole levels etc.
---
I definitely care
---
\*goon sig
---
It'll depreciate in value if you don't use it
---
Yeah boi
---
They have been..? Anom respawn timers got nerfed, carrier application got nerfed, NSA use was made riskier, VNI got nerfed etc.
---
Well thats one way to see it. But atleast you are presenting a cut off point.
---
:surprised pikachu:
---
As the ceo of a large (none block) corp, i can tell you this is killing eve for a lot of people, more than its bringing back...    
---
im pretty sure by the time we hit 1 month, i will have 200 toons that havent logged in out of 550.    
---
if we wanted wh space we would have moved into a wh...
---
shame because of how much time i have invested in eve , something close to 50,000 hours, that i'm losing all interest in playing.  these changes have forced people into the blobs that they wanted to avoid for years.  leaving huge areas of no content, and huge super blobs to fight if you do find content and are not using a bomber to kill excavators.
---
i only meant to point to the fact that whenever provibloc gets hit they call us :)
---
wasnt clear there... im talking drop rate :D
---
so every asset in null should have a 50% chance of dropping and in low 25% meaning people keep 75% of their assets on average
---
Lol ye.
---
Mm fountain...
---
From the devblog on the market broker/tax changes:
---
"The total benefit from skills will increase from 2% (current benefit)  to 4.75%, which translates to a total tax reduction (including  standings benefits) of 47.5% instead of the current 40%."
---
So if I am reading this right, I have a market alt with near perfect Caldari Navy standings and max skills, my taxes/fees should go down, right?
---
I get 400

Asset Safety is more useful as an ISK sink than it is as a loot pinata.  Increase the price of Asset Safety and maybe it where some of your stuff gets destroyed, but not transfer from perons A to perons B.
---
3 days behind the pings. You guys need some new non c-tier spies.
---
No it's fine literally everybody calls waffles "snigg", it's a super common mistake, hence me correcting you. By the way, has anybody ever brought up how weird your reaction is to being shown you're wrong about something
---
&gt; please correct me if Im wrong but the word unassailable means untouchable yes?
---
For suitonia it means 'too much effort', much the same as the north have been saying since WWB.
---
ask you the same question...you ok?? you kinda got jumpy there on those comments....I usually tend to ignore tardiness but you got my attention
---
&gt; given they're almost the exact opposite of goons.
---
eeeeehhhhhh that's stretching it quite a bit
---
Please be for the Chimera, please be for the Chimera, please... :(
---
i mean, as someone who ran with TVP, that typically there would only be 1 or 2 newbros for a fleet of 40.
---
They seemed to have more of a selection of high skill players (as in literally high skill points) so the FC would typically choose 30-37 out of 40 members at least just based on who had higher skills/better fits, and leave lower skill players waiting for an opening.
---
And technically, they did expect you to get ascendancies eventually, just like the upgrade from hyperion to vindi..
---
whereas with WTM you could just kinda fly whatever.
---
As a result, I think we lost like... one? contest to WTM ever while I flew.
---
INIT have been deliberating this move for a long ass time.
---
So we actually saw on recent kills that they had killed a handful of roamers with 10+ procurers as well as a Rapier and Loki. We knew it was a bait setup, but none of the kills we saw had the Domis. The idea was that we'd go trigger the trap and maybe sacrifice a Sabre, but would overwhelm them with a gang of 20.
---
Anyhow we got there about 15 minutes after they had killed a small gang thinking we were gonna deep dick them, and then got absolutely humiliated by the sentry Domis. With no decloak delay on assisting drones they were chucking insta-blap DPS at our Kikis in 2-3 seconds from the time they decloaked. 
---
After we got off field we tried warping a handful of ships onto a Domi, but they were spread out so well that the other Domis forced us back out again, plus the Rapier was full TP fit.
---
plz keep going
---
Tacky..
---
In Catch, like 10 jumps from GE-8. It was WARP that had the trap set up.
---
No.
---
Because you don't know how to use them?
---
I love talking politics anywhere *except in a fucking game*. I'm an activist, I've demonstrated in protests, I will enthusiastically explain my side of the issue all over the internet, but when I want to game, I want to game. 
---
Politics has turned every single MMO into a complete shithole over the last 6 years, starting with everybody's stupid opinions about 'gamergate', with dramatic worsening in the last 3 years. As much as I would love to contribute my years of experience and 200m SP to big groups, I play solo just to avoid the political bullshit.
---
I'm half inclined to organize ops with one rule, no fucking politics or real-life drama. Let's game to game.
---
Figures don't lie, but liars figure.
---
i will have to check this out thanks o7
---
It doesnt seem to explain it
---
If you ask me I would limit how many that can live within a system. I mean like a total revamp of the old system removing lots of the anoms that arent being used and even truesec so that people dont just end up in the same couple of low truesec systems.
---
If you limit it enough people will have to spread out. Cap umbrellas become weaker, intel becomes weaker and even loyalty will be affected. Thats the only way I can think of to actually weaken blobs. 
---
But, balancing small gang with big gang wont work. If hunters get it too easy that means big gangs will get it much easier to hunt. Thats the main concern here. Its not about risk, its about counters.
---
Imagine removing cynos. A 20 man crew of cruisers start to kill a super whilst the super waits for reinforcements. Maybe they arrive in time, maybe they dont. Now imagine that crew is 256 man strong. That super is dead. And its really easy to catch people right now (it wasnt super hard before either honestly).
---
Why would anyone even consider risking it? You would have to buff rewards to billions/hour for it to even make sense. And if you do that then that system will get locked down with bubbles and titans on each gate.
---
Imo, there wasnt anything wrong with the old way, just a problem with distribution. Change that and also allow for NS to actually fight eachother outside of the millions of timers and tedious sov shit and ratting will go down by itself.
---
But still, NS cant be forced to be small gangs only entertainment. CCP needs to give them content by allowing/forcing them to fight eachother. Fix LS, make it worth living there and they will have content.
---
Even with 100ab, good luck hitting ramjags with laser
---
Competent, likeable and only medium size (if they'were small i wouldve left out the *almost*) ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
if you don't have a bubble on you most people wont lose pods either
---
hmmmmmmmmm
---
Pog
---
We are with you brother...
---
fuck i didn't get my complementary 300b in ships and 50b isk package upon joining, god damn it
---
&gt; and maybe it where some of your stuff gets destroyed, but not transfer from perons A to perons B.
---
That’s not an isk sink but a material sink though
---
Are there fleets at different times? 20-21 seems narrow and is right in the middle of my work shift, unfortunately.
---
I was in RvB a long time ago, and it was fun. Was never able to commit enough time to it, unfortunately (the game as a whole).
---
Looking to come back to Eve now, but it seems like such a mountain to climb just to get back and get organized, let alone play.
---
I mean for me everything in EVE is part of the hobby. Getting isk included, so I could either pay 20$ a month to PVP for 2 hours a day or do an hour of PVE and an hour of PVP for free, both of which I equally enjoy.
---
Ofc if you hate PvE and love PvP, then plexing makes sense. 
---
For me it’s like I get paid to play my hobby, I get paid whatever 15*8 dollars a month. Or whatever a sub is, 20$? I haven’t checked in hears.
---
Do all the years include excavator and fighter deaths or just player ships?
---
I thought its weird, too, if that helps.

In July 2018 there was a large battle with supercaps in the system of [UALX-3](https://zkillboard.com/system/30004807/stats/), did you exclude the ISK from that specific battle or did you just leave the effects of that in?   Also, there was a war going on, now there are no wars, so fewer large fleet engagements.  
---
If you really want to measure the effect of the blackout it might be a good idea to build a script that includes the number of people on killmails as well, since there is a large difference between a fight where multiple full fleets slug it out and a fight where a roaming gang fights a home defense gang. While the large fleets might get more kills and probably also higher ISK destroyed I think a lot of people would have more fun in small gang fights.
---
This is disheartening. Carriers was always a dream of mine, and I never got to get into them as I lost the ability to play religiously for a long time.
---
Maybe generating ISK and then using a Thanny for PVP shenans is worth it though? Be nice to see a guide/vid of someone doing similar. Hate having all that SP into stuff even at level V and it not being very useful, especially coming back and not being in Null or larger WHs anymore.
---
But then some of them probably are bots that achieve very little for CCP but drive up PLEX prices potentially driving away actual players that rely on low prices to play at all.
---
Oh ye. Im just trolling him considering he made a post about people not paying attention to details.
---
I mean they have been doing that for years. Way before blackout. J-ODEZ has always had a fleet with bait procs + cloaked sebo domis
---
Asset safety is a relatively small sink. Among my proposals is giving the %15 to the attacker. I don't argue for its entire removal.

&gt; skirmish op/strat op

&gt; possible content

&gt; "lock up the jammer"
---
&gt; warp out and death clone back, leave fleet
---
Or a gila cause it’s cheaper.
---
The high sec number is definitely a result of the war dec changes imo
---
On the map you can highlight by NPC kills and the higher ones in high sec (unless there is an incursion) are likely to be mission areas. 
---
You can also look up on Dotlan to see where there are concentrations of level 4 agents as generally runners want to be where they can quickly run through level 4s.
---
Tldr 
---
suitonia attemps elite stat pad and gets naed on by all of reddit.
---
Don't forget the UALX-3 supercapital battle and camp. That accounted for more than 2.4t.
---
They’re a Goon. That’s what they’re doing wrong.
---
Im not opposed to this
---
If you're complaining about folks running away when you bring something they can't possibly fight, you're the problem. 
---
Downship and have fun, don't stay bitter a small gang didn't want to stay and die to your boson and complain on Reddit about it. 
---
I *really* don't care that it's not fair to your capital pilots, or to your bloc that put so much "effort" into building their super fleets. You should be playing for content and to have fun, no to flash your "effort" in everyone's faces. 
---
I'll *always* downship if it means getting a fight.
---
Why would I care rather or not you split your guns?
---
Nah dude everyone should be able to have 5 iq and everything go smooth.
---
Maybe they should pay more attention and you wouldn't have to ask if everyone is through as much.
---
Well, you wanted a shiny pod kill, you got a shiny pod kill.
---
CCP does exploration like real men. Not with those pesky "analyzer" things
---
WOW LEAVE IT TO GOONS TO GOONPOST ONCE AGAIN WOW GREAT DERAIL LEARN TO POST GOON WHY DON'T YOU GO GET INTO THE "GREATEST WARFLEET" AND WARP TO ZERO ON THAT BACKSPACE KEY AMITOTE REDDIT AHAHAHA
---
Have you considered leaving 1dq?
---
I mean assest safety is currently an isk sink since you have to pay to get your stuff back. But its still a trash mechanic
---
What happened was people have started fucking with the imperium. Now that we have a small chance to get in and out of their space without a supercap fleet being dropped on a few cruisers, or a hundred t3ds chasing our small frig gang, we’ve decided it’s fun to watch goons cry salty tears. The fact is their are people in eve that are faster, more slippery, and smarter than goon. This makes them butthurt. Especially fun when you just bomb their excavators and run. I propose more people go fuck with the imperium.
---
Why wait, move in today!  
---
Raitaru's are just over 600m atm and should by far be the most expensive thing you take into the wormhole to start with.  
---
Whatever you think you are preparing (other than the Raitaru) in your one month is probably not going to matter.
---
* Fly cheap ships
---
* take fights even if you are going to lose
---
   * you gain pvp experience this way and it doesn't cost a lot
---
   * you gain friends when you fight
---
   * you avoid getting evicted by people wanting fights
---
* everything you undock in EVE is already dead, everything in a WH is undocked
---
Take your ritalin please sir
---
ok ok
---
FUCK YEAH
---
At that point i was angry because i felt like i was being friendly with my initial response and then your response felt very hostile.
---
The fewer people are mostly bots btw
---
Lol. Blackout is never going to have an effect on strategic fleets or wars. The main thing it does is making it more dangerous to be in space without backup (like a lot of ratters and miners are). The lack of wars is not due to the blackout, but because of other factors, like the current meta and current large bloc politics.
---
&gt; Competent
---
a couple fcs? sure, the average linemember is just as bad as the rest.
---
&gt; likeable
---
dabatable, but to each their own i guess
---
&gt; medium size
---
init + init mercenaries are literally the 4th biggest "alliance" in the game, and even if they were to be counted separately(which makes no sense to) **both** are still in the top 10 biggest alliances in the game
---
The blue donut will finally be realized. Nullsec will be at peace and the only conflicts will be rorquals fighting over the last spod rock in the anom.
---
As the CEO I have access to TEST data (PAPs etc.), Zkill data, my own experiences as someone that works from home and is around a lot, the experience as an FC for my corp that sees more people coming out to have fun, and just what people tell me.  
---
Some dislike it for sure.  They are vastly outnumbered by all the people that have said that they like it and all of the people that came back to the game because of blackout.  I'm sure some have quit, but I couldn't give you a name right now.  I would rather have someone that likes Eve for what it was designed to be than someone that will just quit whenever things don't go their way.
---
Welcome to America, land where if you scream the loudest you can get anything you want.
---
Agreed!
---
That was quite autistic
---
This. Imperium is crying, because they helped fuck up null and made it boring or worthless for anyone who wanted to do anything but be a line member and press f1. I flew with goons once upon a time it was boring as fuck. Either let’s go bash a station, or we’ll only fight with overwhelming superiority with no chance to lose. GG goons, I honestly hope the big null blocs implode, even if it cuts the game population. I’d rather have 10,000 people who like fun instead of 30,000 who fly as null bloc drones.
---
OMG my eyes bleed just by looking at the shitfit. Double shield boosters? What kind of fit is that? There are plenty of decent fit Tengu for PVP and PVE in zkillboard
---
Please tell me more
---
when did fighters and excavators start producing killmails? Would that also inflate NS killmails compared to before they did?
---
Red vs Blue seems like the BEST THING EVAR for PVP!
---
I constantly read about miserable ganktards unable to find any gud fights in PVP roams.  With blackouts in null, that seems to be getting worse, with everyone docking up.
---
Why don't more PVPers take advantage of the RvB fights, or even create other "RvB-ish" groups of their own?  Regular fights that you can count on!   I spend most of my time running missions, but this seems like a dream come true for PVP...
---
If you have some friends you can spend your time ganking idiots like this https://zkillboard.com/kill/78162614/
---
Dato why is Jake not in a Slasher?
---
Actually the state of the game these days.
---
Nice
---
If you think TEST harbours bots, I have a bridge to sell you.
---
Its more than the Blackout.  There is more going on to the Blackout.   Taking the large blocs,which I am not a part of,  at their word the instability caused by not knowing what the fuck CCP is doing has hinder big bloc wars.  Imperium left the North a little early,  TEST/Frat war had a 10 day pause more or less from what I understand.  No telling what plans have been cancel due to the chaos.  I'm not arguing for or against blackout, but asking is the game really more vibrant.  Providence was a hellish landscape for the first 96 hours.  Then it has died down to barren wasteland.  US TZ defense fleets use to get up to 2 pages worth of kills on a good night now were lucky to get a half a page.
---
oh wow, your fit and or skills are garbage then.
---
My tengus all hit 750
---
This is the point they might be making making. If it takes you three hours to find content, you might be bad at it.
---
your skills much be terrible.
---
I run no damage rigs and do more.
---
Sigh I can find "content" in about 20 minutes if I only go to null blocs and their super umbrellas. Problem is that doesnt get you fights that gets you a ratter kill if youre lucky which is boring or dropped on by supers also boring, its now aids to try and bait subcap responses from going after people outside of those areas as no one wants to be there post blackout.
---
Lold
---
I survived the blast and the response fleet in a vanilla C3, buffer fit with T2 1600mm EANM and explosive rig.
---
Because no one cares about goon(s) ~~pets~~
---
material that has value.
---
Do you have this in like a google docs spreadsheet format? I'd be interested in taking the data and messing around with some graphs.
---
That is not the point though. Material sinks have a different impact on the economy than isk sinks. Best not to mix them up when discussing things
---
&gt; the complete incompetence of Military leadership.
---
So what would you say about the competence of the guys losing to them?
---
Just a real question here. How many of those kills are excavators and fighters and how mane are actual players/ships destroyed?
---
You should do them in a Strat instead of a Astero, I imagine a T3C could survive it no problem, but it will cost more and not have the hacking bonus the Strat has.
