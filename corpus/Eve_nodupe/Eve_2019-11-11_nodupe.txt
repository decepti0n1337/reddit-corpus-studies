The Grind of waiting for skills get tedious and quite honestly boring. Injected my first carrier just yesterday after spending 4 years in sub caps. Just didn’t want to wait any more.

I think the only ways you could piss off external alliance diplos would be breaking a promise on cooperative ops and backstabbing, dropping citadels where they shouldn't be, or cloaky camping in the wrong area.  Like I thought test was almost always fair target for dread bombs - the restrictions came in leaving cloakies online and placing citadels in paragon soul or esoteria. if test is a fair target, why would test pets be any different?
---

---
biggest downside is moving 100+ dreads into position for a high chance of failure.  if they aren't moved quietly ahead of time, the higher the odds groups are prepared for them.

Linemember #7628998! You're late for the moon extraction! One of the damn finest empire builders our alliance has seen! The way you dropped your 3 nyx alt on the 4 man subcap gang, you're amazing at fighting outnumbered. You're blue donut medal will be coming through the mail shortly.
---
Don't forget the empire building narrative!
---
Goons and test have historically shot each other a lot living next to each other in the south.  the only thing is there hasn't been sustained campaigns.  more like "daily 17:00 fleet coming through".

You really are delusional... You seriously want eve to be a game of only supers fighting supers in endgame, that sounds terrible... Don't get me wrong I enjoy doomsdaying some fool in my titans from time to time but that isn't immersing content, it's jump to cyno, press button, wait 5 mins, dock in keepstar.  If super/titan fights were actually a thing that'd be great but it'll never happen, most of those pilots/corps/alliances are too scared to lose them, you should want subcaps and dreadbombs to be viable or you'll literally do nothing but kill rats in your "end game ships" till the end of time, cause it's obvious you don't venture outside of friendly space much to fight.
---
In a simple economical system yeah but I know for a fact there are several "PLEX whales" out there who bought thousands and thousands of PLEX with isk when it first came out and have been slowly selling back to the market for years. CCP isn't making any money off of those people and at least a sliver of the market is their speculation
---
Other than buying them from someone who already has one, to my knowledge, there is no way to get more.

If you count killing a solo cruiser with your nyx fighting... Sure sounds good.
---
Are lobbyists ever taken seriously for their expertise? Or are they taken seriously because they can provide benefits to lawmakers? Quite a difference there. 
---
You are masquerading that having connections or communication with people who have expertise equals you having the same expertise.
---
The CSM took place just over a month ago, and changes were already talked about at Vegas for wormholes. Before the CSM he polled a large portion of the WH community with 1,000 responses. Quite a good number considering the small and multinational pop in wormholes.

Yep I’m in Vindi along with Matt. Don’t recognize your Reddit name but you can contact me in game anytime.
---
I mean that just shows how unvaforable IT IS If only force recons can light cynos. It makes everything a pain in the ass
---
I agree, you definitely shouldn't be able to inject capital skills.
---
Look into a Rapid Heavy Barghest (or whatever missile you fancy), they have more or less replaced RNI in every possible way with 9 effective launchers instead of 8 with application bonus.
---
&gt;Yes. But CCP weren't ignorant to how many supercaps there are when they did the latest balance pass on them, so I'm pretty sure they did not assume superblobs will not be a thing. They have their reasons I'm afraid.
---
I mean sure but Rise has admitted they don't know how to balance capitals in general and subcaps are more what they are good at for balancing.
---
Does your hatred of wormholes comes from you afk mining in a shiny but shit fit rorq that you lost to a fleet that popped out of a wormhole and you can't deal with it being your own fault so you go on some retarded crusade against wormholes and people who live in them.
---
This just happened yesterday. Out roaming with corp-mates when I DC mid jump through a gate. Reconnect everything is fine we're on our merry way. About 2 hours later we come back through the system I discoed in and we see a ship with the exact name my previous ship had when I flew through first time and discoed. Upon scanning it down it is in fact my ship from earlier. Here's where it gets interesting, that particular ship is in-fact back in my hangar in our Astra. After trying to board it to no avail we decide to kill it:  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/79812578/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/79812578/) 
---
TLDR duplicated a ship which I couldn't board but still generated a killmail and didn't drop any loot.
---
**Also how the fuck do you drop 100+ dreads and not kill anything lmao** because we trickled in... cyno problems. I could be wrong but I dont think we ever had close to 100 dreads on grid shooting at any time. live and learn lol. Good response and GF to tho the opposition. I look forward to next time.
---
Like, even if it might get op...
---
Why don't you go feed some Dreks about it ;)
---
Just get a Stratios.
---
Omg good job phanny grunt,  I'm sending u isk for killing that many goons in one fight. :)
---
Yes
---
Remove siren and dromi tackle ability and GSF will failscade. Fucking retards cant do anything outside of a super umbrella.
---
So what did you "spend" your first 100m SP on?
---
Well I'm only at about 55m SP so I have some huffing skills, mining links, some hauling skills, and PI for passive money generation. Almost all racial skills below BSs to 5, most t2 ships, loki/prot to 4 or 5, most good weapon systems to 5, most precursors to 5, relevant nano skills to 5, ECM skills to 5, logi skills to 5, hacking, scanning. 
---
I can pretty much fly any subcap that doesn't have a slew of t2 links on it. 
---
Alt can fly a sabre and a leshak for c5 krabbing
---
Does that mean mittani is just our other alt?
---
yeah you can't block npc vendors, but i think that what the man above said may be the story you're looking for
---
We are all busy botting in 0.0, and tackling our own shit every once in a while so nobody notices.
---
I have to say I like this fatigue idea. I'm pro injectors because without them I'd have quit again (just for the reason you mentioned) but I like the idea that you're limited to how many you can use in a short time frame.
---
The best defense is to not be afk and not make it worth it to be ganked in the first place.
---
I would appreciate afk proteus ratters :D
---
CCP is aware that there are many flaws in the user interface. For little suggestions you best post in the little things trhead on their forum: https://forums.eveonline.com/t/little-things-small-qol-suggestions/3545
---
They indeed often implement suggestions there. The people running little things won't scan reddit for suggestion.
---
&gt;1)Auto stacking items that I transfer to my inventory. I do a lot of exploration and am constantly looting cans. Itd be nice if i didnt have to right click to stack all items to get them to organize themselves every time.
---
would be nice indeed.
---
&gt;2)Multibuy from more than just the current station/single station. The ability to multibuy from the cheapest seller in the current region would be nice.
---
in the current region would be a pain. current system would be something I'd use from time to time.
---
&gt;3)Selling items from within containers that are within a station. Can be a pain especially if i have things that I dont want to sell in my inventory but not yet sorted to a container.
---
Would be super nice but I doubt that this can be easily implemented atm. The container system seems to me to be a workaround for CCPs limited hangar management code. They don't fully grasp how important a better hangar management would be for the everyday life of the players. No limit to 1000 individual items per hangar. Shared hangars per access list and so on would be super nice. Also industry window is alway problematic when looking through big blueprint libraries.
---
&gt;4)
---
I never get the behaviour of pinned windows. I only always pin because I don't like transparent windows. Just better windows and transparency overall would certainly be great.
---
&gt;5)The ability to synchronize Probe scanner information with people in your fleet. Being part of a corp that operates out of a WH, on occasion I find myself working with a corp mate scanning down chains. Itd be nice if there could be an auto sync feature with people in your fleet so its easier to coordinate what signatures people should work on.
---
People use bookmarks and out of game mapper tools like https://www.pathfinder-w.space/ and https://tripwire.eve-apps.com/ I don't think CCP should aim to get those mapping tools as ingame tools.
---
Again, if you have little things to suggest post them on the eve forums.
---
That's the day I fired 1 bomb to clear off bubbles and got on 1.5t isk of kills.
---
That's pretty simple.
---
Security is basic human, let's say, need(it's not exactly it, but can't find better translation). Most people even in real life will exchange their freedom for their security. Same goes for game where you can lose stuff that can be expensive as fuck.
---
A lot of people just come to EVE and play it a lot. So they start to treat it like part of their real lives and act like it is. That's why a lot of them become risk averse. So they group together and prefere to do something as safe as possible, so ratting or mining in Delve. And they get too used to it.
---
I don't know if you were in Imperium, but every time there was campaign people were complaining that there is no protection and they can't farm more. That's what security led to.
---
To sum it up: it's all about comfort. People strive to have it.
---
Of course if you ask many will say "hell yeah, I love pvp in EVE" but they love it when they can safely drop titans on subcap fleet and boson the shit out of it. Or if the pvp will take 15 minutes and they can go back to their rorquals.
---
Anyway, I hope I cleared that a little(honestly this subject is the only real thing I brought from my national security uni, lol)
---
I dont think its good to arbitrarily force wait times on people. That isnt fun, for none involved.  What am I ratting for sll the time if I cant even have my work be rewarded with being able to sit in the next thing quicker? Why should I be forced to wait? I can dee that the game becomes unhealthy when everyone gets to inject into siperd, but everything below that? Fuck that
---
nice meme
---
&gt;tfw you use to train farm 10 million sp chars and sell them on the forums for billions of isk and noobs are acting like that this exact thing hasn't been going on since 2007
---
Plebs, man. I don't get them.
---
I think the whole point of my post can be distilled into the last line you wrote there. The point being is that *sand*castles built in a *sand* box can be easily knocked over and rebuilt. Regions with thousands of structures and dozens of keepstars backed up by 1000 man super and titan fleets, not so much.
---
remove sov
---
  remove citadels
---
  you'll still have the same problem: major coalitions and supercaps.
---
And I stand by my comment: It's a PLAYER issue- Not CCP. You can't force people not to make 1000 man alliances and titan fleets. Eve is a *sandbox*.
---
While I appreciate the effort that went into this post, and I'm also a die-hard fan of Paradox Strategies (HOI, EU, CK, Vicky, Stellaris, etc) as well as 4X games in general... And while in theory, some of the concepts in those games would balance out the "tall vs wide" issues, you also have to understand it's a completely different beast.
---
Using EU4 as a template... Even with a large group of friends, the vast majority of pieces on the map are going to be AI. On top of that, a player can only play one faction at a time.
---
In null sec, every organization is player run. And people can create organizations at will. If you target groups, or territory, with direct mechanical buffs/penalties applied to the groups, or territory, the leaders of the powers that be will just make alts (or have lackeys and pawns) to run puppet states and shell corporations and the like, to circumvent it.
---
Mechanics in 4X games work because of hardcoded limitations on how the game exists. In a sandbox like EVE, there's a lot more freedom. You almost need to look at it with a more 'real life' lens, seeing what restrictions and rules can be put in place, and then stretching yourself to the absolute limit trying to find ways around them, trying to see you can exploitnthen. Because the players will. Sort of like sports, or formula 1, or the like.
---
Goonswarm is a large community where you can basically find any type of eve gameplay. You can pretty much do whatever you feel like as long as you don't break the rules. Goonswarm is very capitalistic where everyone is encouraged to make their own fortune and find their own fun. Since Goonswarm have many players and Delve is rich there's a lot of fleets going out each day to poke others and to defend our space, and that is without even counting sigs and squads.
---
If you're a new/poor players we have a lot of guides and programs that will help make you ISK stable and to be able to afford doctrine ships and quite a good SRP system both Alliance wide and Corp specific.
---
As for the bad rap. Everyone hates the best. I guess the old "We are not here to ruin the game, we are here to ruin your game" that is mostly not true anymore. There are some (read many) who still embody this but it's Goonswarm nowadays are not worse than any other group.
---
As for past/current  corp history it should've matter (at least according to what I've heard from the recruitment team) but if you've joined Brave you might as well give it a shot, they're not what they used to be (hearsay, since I've never been in Brave) but you should make up your own mind. In Brave you'll at least always have the underdog tag.
---
By running and hiding. Hunter and pray dynamic.

What the farmer shouldn’t be able to do is just sit in a field eating the same blade of grass completely ignoring the lions around it. At very least he should have to move every so often to find new food.

  Oh so, docking up and waiting for the cloaky t3 cruisers to go away?
---
  That's the solution?
---
when we would be ganking, when the random osprey and augorer dudes would rep who we shoot would be annoying as hell, i dont think that can happen anymore.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
but a blackbird sitting on the gate waiting to JAM the ships that go flashy, it can be quite annoying and really ruin things often,
---
Ah thank you. I couldn’t remember the exact numbers. I don’t use structures to kill them myself, though I have seen people I’ve stalked struggle with more than 2. I have also seen a couple holes before with 10+ since Vietnam.
---
Oh no, you can for sure. Just making the point that they’re not actually broken and shoot back. It is something that pretty much everyone agrees needs to be removed or adjusted by CCP.
---
This sounds more like an angry former member of PGGB or someone they wronged in the past coming here to smug.
---
I couldn't have worded this better myself, the amount of potentially fun fights that we couldn't take simply because the enemy was willing to bring 2-3x our numbers and have supercap support on standby is sad.
---
when i move my frieghter with my web alt.
---
i click dual on my web toon to my frieghter toon, i double check the name and i accept. then gate to gate (with greensafety set on my web toon) i am allowed to agress him on each each, the faster i can lock and apply the webs, the faster he warps. pretty much the second i click warp on my frieghter, i alt tab click lock on my rapier and 3x webs is insta warp
---
I've said fax are shit and to nerf supers/titans/rorqs for quite a long time.
---
I'm not saying it won't, I just think the reactions from people in null was perfectly reasonable. CCP had the right idea but instead of implementing a change that would have brought balance to both forms of play styles (pve and PVP), they took the monkey trying to fuck a bucket approach and tilted it heavily in the opposite direction.
---
If they do the same with Citadels, Titans and asset safety then they will get the same reaction, and rightly so. 
---
What they need to get into their heads is they need to fix what is broken, not break it in a completely different way.
---
Currently; krab for another PvP Nyx.
---
Ok, take your pills plz

No, falcon left :(

Whats the point of the RNI. It has the exact same damage as a regular raven. One extra launcher without the damage bonus just makes it harder to fit.??

Does it though?
---
https://www.superdataresearch.com/understanding-mmo-retention/
---
&gt;For free-to-play MMOs we see stabilization occurring generally 24 months after release, as this is a period in which the quality of newly arriving players improves. Players that start playing at this time are generally introduced by word-of-mouth or have made the decision to join after more careful consideration rather than trying the game out of boredom or serendipity. Consequently, retention among these late arrivals skews higher, with roughly 40% of users logging on one day after their first login and 2% of them returning on the 30th day after they first log in. This percentage drops further when looking at a longer time frame, such as 90, 180 or even 540 days, as pictured below.
---
*One in fifty players* stays in the game for a month.
---
I wonder if CCP knows that abysmally low retention rates are the industry standard...
---
But this isnt just a supercap issue, its an issue with whatever size is currently the biggest one atm. If you delete supers/titans today theres still gonna be regular caps. And youre gonna have the same issue. Remove them and youre gonna have the next best ship and so on. 
---
Literally erase all the caps in the game today. What do you think is gonna happen? Everyone is just gonna start fighting? Stagnation vanishes? No, nothing will change. The weapon of choice is a question of meta, of best current practices, its not a question of of why you should do something but rather a question of how.
---
We need a why. Why fight? Everybody is content, everyone has more than they need. So what should we fight over? Partially this is due to few players, if the game had twice the current amount there would be more strife due to shortages. But since we cant magically conjure up more players we need the next best thing, artifically creating strife.
---
Easiest way I see is by introducing something everyone wants/needs but in a limited supply forcing people to actually fight. If the why never gets fixed then it doesnt matter how much you fix the how, it will miss the mark.
---
We have plenty of people who'd want more fighting but the mechanics are preventing them to do any real harm. Your castle on every field allegory is apt in how it describe current mechanics except the fact that there's not even a way to storm those castles, they have to be starved out and when you're done with one "castle", you will have to do the same with all other 25143621362 "castles".
---
The problem isn't lack of potential Warlords, it's the mechanics that hinders those would be warlords to actually do any permanent damage.
---
Second that, very good even if you can only listen.
---
Thats him leaving in style
---
&gt;It’s probably the biggest reason wormholers are so hated on, because our playstyle is drastically different from the rest of the turbokrab forum warriors.
---
I would say it's more likely the blindingly clueless, smug, "holier-than-thou" attitude that positively drips from every idiot post like this one where you just *have* to asininely imply that you're somehow above everyone else simply because you choose to live somewhere where there's no Local and you have to scan out the chain daily before you can bother to do anything.
---
I've spent more time in jspace than any other environment in Eve myself, so I know for a fact it doesn't transform you into anything more than what you flew into it as. It's a different style of play with its own challenges and concerns, but it doesn't negate others or make jspace denizens the authority on game balance or mechanics.
---
In short, *no one gives a shit if you're a 'wormholer btw'*. If more of you would present a well-reasoned discussion instead of attempting a pathetic appeal-to-authority based on willingly living somewhere less convenient, you might be taken more seriously.
---
I don't see how you say this statement after this:

Taxi Hecate, about 30k ehp in under 2sec align...

Best Taxi for HighSec / LowSec if you expect gatecamps with groups of smartbomb battleships.
---
As a former GTA player, that’s disappointing. You should be able to go rogue.
---
His goal isn't to actually fix the game, it's to fix the problems **his** particular flavor of enjoyment faces.
---
From what I learned, tight knit groups with repeating fleets are only possible with RL friends. Doesn't matter, though. Join an alliance and find many, many new friends (like I did). Even, if the "usual suspects" are busy elswhere (offline), you'll likely find many like-minded people each day.
---
You're trying to make new friends to have fun. If more players were like you, EVE would be better. Many play "alts and alts online". I'm kinda guilty as well.
---
Yeah I heard FE is pretty neat
---
So please explain to me how what I said is wrong?
---
I agree the problem is objective to fight over, everything since Citadel has progressively removed that, but I think the super problem needs tackled first.  Even with shitty mechanics people are willing to fight but not if the other side just drops their supers to end fights.  Look at the HS brawls with the same mechanics but no caps, I think that should speak to the oppressive state of caps (mostly supers &amp; fax) right now.
---
&gt; *Top* Active PVP Groups?
---
So ill just answer D - You lack experienced leadership.
---
Good fleet commanders take months to raise, with a few costly mistakes along the way. Line members need training as well. EVE is a game where raw player skill matters more than elsewhere and most wars are actually lost by stupid leadership mistakes before they even start. 
---
EVE is a comprehensive game - a failure to properly address one of the war aspects will lead to utter destruction. I would ask myself the following: was a proper communication (and propaganda) set during the conflict? Were there any plans to concentrate people into a few systems for safety? did you have a restricted amount of coherent doctrines ? did you try metagaming your opponent (spies/local spam/diplo...)? 
---
A lot of your issues though are completely normal and just a chronic cultural shock you get when you leave highsec - you will get better with time. However i may add that i had projects similar to yours before and it did become a nightmare too, even with a lot of greatly talented leaders (open to discuss in MP if you wish). Pursue such goals but be aware it may be a huge time sink.

you get like 120 mill mass with 100 mn higgs wreathe and that is already at the limit of jumpable mass cold. Remember max jumpable mass is 20 mill and a higgs doubles the hull mass, so the biggest hull mass before the higgs you can get is 10 mill which is the exact mass of a wreathe. If my memery serves me well the only BC that can actually roll a C1 with a higgs fitted is a gnosis.

i see about Goons. Intresting...

Big fix would be spammability of citadels

Why did panfam not defend when goons attacked? Because our pockets are deep enough to replace anything lost and we could do so with ease.

Remember how hard it was to construct stations in nullsec? Maybe not “hard”, but frustrating. Bringing the freighter out, the egg, all that shit.

“But I don’t want to go among blobbers,” Hustlan_Jones remarked.

“Oh, you can’t help that,” said Daavid_Cee: “we’re all blobbers here. I’m a blobber. You’re a blobber.”
---
“How do you know I’m a blobber?” said Hustlan_Jones.
---
“You must be,” said Daavid Cee, “or you wouldn’t still be playing.”
---
I'm no expert on the matter - having never fought on either side of it - but I can't help seeing nerfs to booshers as being a direct buff to the null empire supercap security umbrellas. The booshing bomber thing seems to be one of few things that can (well: could) actually hurt them.

Is this accurate, or doesn't it affect that tactic as much as I think?

Nonono. We were talking about the proteus. I was saying compare the proteus vs a legion.

it 's in the link :

The skill requirements for Tech 1 light combat drones have been reduced to make them more quickly accessible to new capsuleers:
---
    The prerequisite to train the Light Drone Operation skill has been reduced from Drones 3 to Drones 1
---
    The level of the Drones skill required to use Tech 1 light combat drones has been reduced from 3 to 1
---
    The level of the Drones skill required to use faction and integrated light combat drones has been reduced from 3 to 2
---
JFs to covert cynos any time. 
---
Surely a ship with 0 combat ability jumping to a covert cyno is fine if infinite bombers through one is also fine
---
I don’t play Eve for the major wars, but the major wars are good for Eve. They generate interest and sometimes reset the map.
---
Those years of stagnation after B-R and before WWB were some of the most fun years I had in Eve. My corporation moved three times in that time span (Tenal to Delve, Delve to Fountain, Fountain to Vale). Everywhere we went, there was vibrant small gang fighting. It wasn’t an existential struggle, but there was always something going on. 
---
What wasn’t present were Rorquals, Supercapital umbrellas, and citadels. From what I can tell, those have pretty much wiped out the small gang content you used to get when a gang tackled a Procurer or Dominix. Or pinged your station services. Or just flew through to say hi.
---
If we didn’t have injectors, it would have taken longer to get to the point where Rorquals flood the belts and Supercapitals are half previous costs. Alas, we do, and they don’t seem to be going away given how wonderful they are for CCP.
---
Which means that CCP needs to observe the old rules about application up and down the chain.
---
In general, Eve ships are supposed to apply well to the class immediately below them (with some obvious exceptions, such as ABC’s and HAC’s). 
---
At the top, Carriers and HAW Dreadnoughts can be fine as anti-Battleship platforms. Regular Dreadnoughts can be fine as anti-Capital ships. Long range Dreadnoughts should be able to destroy structures with impunity, unless the Defenders form a fleet to fight them. Then Supercarriers (with only heavy fighters) and Titans (with no HAW guns at all) can act as the top end anti-Capital ship. They’d require a sub capital support fleet, but they could be the nuclear weapons you break out to defend your space.
---
That's just Falcon.  
---
Leaving in style.
---
Flair checks out
---
you can still do booshing its just takes a small amount of coordination.  
---
every boosher warp scrams the boosher below him in the booshing channel and bam its the same thing....
---
So this means earlier access to T2 drones?
---
Sit there and bump someone off a gate for 3 hours while demanding screenshots of their inventory set to 40% transparency, across various different colour templates.
---
Beg them for 5 space dollars to leave you alone. Repeat until you decide it's not worth spending 7 space dollars to teach them a lesson.
---
Log off for the night and do the same tomorrow.
---
This is currently the top tier eve warlord content. For best results, mix with some personal workout routines; such as;
---
* Person you're bumping is carrying nothing: Do 5 push-ups
---
* You manage to miss your bump, allowing them to warp off: Jog on the spot (5 min)
---
* You convince the bumped party to a duel on an alt "to help you escape with webs": Do 10 Squat Jumps
---
* Bumped party really doesn't care at all and just logs off: Do 10 crunches
---
* You write a post on r/eve about stagnating content beyond your first hour of bumping: Do 25 Jumping Jacks
---
* Someone accepts your scam contract during the bump: Do 5 pull-ups
---
Keep it all varied and you'll both be an eve warlord, and in buff shape in no time. Good luck!
---
This is a good change.
---
Maybe if nul-sec actually lived up to its name the game wouldnt be stagnated trash.  Fucking care bares with their asset recovery hiding in their super umbrellas are giant pussies and shouldnt be seen as anything but.
---
There isn't anything to really fight over except pride and grudge matches. Thanks to several mechanics either isn't really sustainable because groups are likely to burn out before completing anything meaningful. Test managed against Frat mainly because we really spread out the conflict and had a huge numbers advantage.
---
Other mechanics eliminate the need to fight others for resources.
---
What we need is new/changed mechanics that force fights between groups. Ideally ones that leave the problematic mechanics out of that part of the game and introduce new, but limited, incomes (not necessarily ISK).
---
Imagine a wormholes 2.0, only explicitly designed for alliance level fights. Longer timescales on "connections", shifting battlefields, engagement limits, maybe structure limits, T3-like exclusive resources (maybe shift mining one step up. Null-ore only from null-moons and moongoo only in J-space 2.0?)? Link everything back to individual null regions and maybe there is a way to generate conflict. Obviously this idea would need a heck of a lot more thought than I put in just now, but bottom-line remains: we need reasons to fight. Current mechanics don't provide that need.
---
Talking in Stations, jin'taan, rooks n kings, imperium stuff, eventually if I get around to editing out all the coring bits, I think the spectre fleet videos could be pretty fun and show how roams work etc...shameless self promo...
---
The drone skill changes are incomprehensible to me, the biggest "speed bump" was always getting Drones V. It's pointless to even get the other skills before you get Drones V.
---
That's depressing lol.
---
LOL get away from the best drone boats in the game that's funny.. But I wish. They really need a nerf IMHO but why kill the best crabbing ships in the game haha.. Just sucks that they are 80% of the time the single best answer. If not all the time.. It's silly really.
---
Command destroyers were used to "boosh", jump, entire fleets around the grid. So subcap comps used these, more often than not, in bomber setups called stukas/gokus. 
---
They were quite OP as they didnt really have a downside and could be jumped around basically infinitely. Without the ability to jump around as much the comp becomes much weaker so if you go in for a kill you might not get out as easily.
---
I'm guessing it's an "if you're using this exploit, you'll know" situation.
---
Not gonna lie, considering this an exploit is pretty silly after it's been allowed (and really widespread) for years. Pretty much every group has done this when they lack the numbers for optimal payouts.
---
Between triple shots of JD and breaking bongs, allegedly, someone signed us up for a cap roam in Vegas. It's clear our failure began by not inebriating the antagonist sufficiency to forget our commitment.   
---
We ended up with a cackling goon in our teamspeak threatening to release compromising photographs of a LAWN Diplo, unless we followed him to Gmagic. Came through the gate and was not disappointed by what we found. Thanks for the GF
---
God forbid you have 10 people who can pilot
---
I think it means anyone who throws a spare pod/afk ship in fleet to meet the optimal payout numbers - which is just stupid. Incursions aren't even good ISK these days.
---
Whats lowsec?:)
---
I just didn't realize that stuka were so necessary I guess. It makes sense why they'd be so powerful, but I haven't really done any of that myself so there you go. Thanks for the explanation.
---
O-Cal = top try hard by a wide margin.
---
Some good pilots, but some guys are all ISK wallet warrior with HG everything and 1bil ISK frigs.
---
Some solo guys but can be blobby at times.

---
Fixed an issue where the Agency window's default position would be in the bottom right corner
---
Removed the unnecessary "Find in Contracts" button from the show-info window of some monument objects
---
&gt; Passive moon mining was far worse than what we have now.
---
Mate almost every fight of note in the game for 10 years was over a money moon.
---
&gt; The game needs more mechanics where organized, expansive empires are rewarded.
---
There has never been a single point in time EVE Online's history where it has rewarded large organised groups more than right now. If that was the  problem _why is almost every single player in the game a member of a large organised group_?
---
&gt; If they all post like OP then I agree.
---
The funny thing is most of them do.
---
Yeah I know of booshing I just didn't realize they were so powerful I guess. Thanks for the info.
---
the problem of injectors is that everyone can be in the flavour of the month immediately.
---
if it takes a year to train into the flavour of the month, or the current broken met,a CCP has time to nerf it before it becomes too imbalanced.
---
Not quite. Also add in that anyone who actually targets you can freely get the drop on you by preparing in advance, anoms don't respawn, anoms require more isk on field to clear, anoms are more lucrative, it takes time and effort *at time of ratting* to "turn off the gates", and anyone can randomly add a gate into your system directly from their staging.
---
Then it's like what we have, and we have been actively asking CCP to nerf our ratting safety.
---
You should vote with your wallet!
---
People voted with the wallets.
---
No I mean you should stay and get endlessly farmed because it's good for my playstyle!
---
That is my guess, my second best guess is VG fleets running with 11 because the extra battleship is sometimes worth it isk/h wise. If so, it's been a widely and openly documented practice at least 2012: rooks and kings incursion video mentions it.
---
Bet they'd undock their shit and fight if they knew they were going to loose it anyways
---
F
---
How to make bounty hunting a thing in game:  
---
Bounties now use plex  
---
Min bounty is 500 plex  
---
Bounty agents added to hand out bounty missions on players in space
---
Hahahahahahahaha. Oh no no r/eve, you made your occupancy sov bed, and now you get to lie in it. Lie in it goooood and loooong. Enjoy!
---
Asset safety should be limited to alliance headquarters systems.
---
&gt;RMT PLEX with stolen credit card
---
&gt;wash it via in-game bounty agents using an alt to kill the bounty target
---
&gt; ???
---
&gt; profit!!
---
Most people dont want to spend hundreds of dollars a month plus however many hundreds of hours like marshy or what's his face
---
Falcon's *on* your left.
---
Uh, no one is getting paid. Email is free fyi, and the cost of a letter per person is not a barrier. These are literally the NRA emailing their members in a district  saying "X bill will erode YOUR RIGHTS, let your Senator know that you care!"
---
im not a boomer im actually 15
---
&gt;it can hurt supers, therefore OP
---
We're probably the most active Pacific-US/AUTZ group.  It really depends what tz you're looking for.
---
Roaming to the area can be tricky. Most of the groups around here are at minimum competent, and most have some pretty damn good pilots. So if you're a newer guy roaming around, you're likely to just get dunked.
---
Ok Boomer
---
Tech 2 Attack Battlecruisers.
---
I am all for that.
---
CCP should select a cut off date that can't be worked towards and anyone that had the Magic 14 gets their SP refunded while all toons start with those skills maxed. That way we can get people into ships immediately.
---
I attended a couple fanfests in Iceland and they always do the eve video morning. I was disappointed this video wasn’t shown before a live audience.
---
&gt;Remove siren and dromi tackle ability and GSF will failscade. 
---
No they won't
---
What
---
Wat
---
&gt; And then prohibit players from extracting magic14
---
Or just fucking get rid of it and set it as a default value.
---
I think we'll have to disagree here. The only reason the goons keep Legacy close is so that another WWB doesn't happen. Further, the main lessons the goons learned is that need alliances other than theirs to really cope with Panfam. They needed the russians in B-R and CO2 in WWB. Once their 40,000 character coalition was on their own, the house of cards fell.
---
And surely you can see the content has dried up for most of the Imperium. It should have been obvious when we let them shoot our unrigged keepstars in the north simply because we could care less about getting blobbed by 3,000 players to our 800. There is such a thing by bluing too many people.
---
nope not at all... but it does address on key point that rise did make and that is that if capital bombs are AOE then they can be used to kill incoming cap fleets as they cyno in. 
---
He was thinking just making them to bc and bs but that did not feel right to him. I saw the other thread also asking for when they do this to make a tech II BC too though this is more fleshed out concept then the one already posted.
---
No it cant. All accounts on grid. That's means half your fleet of boxed chars cant stay in the first room. They must advance to the last room.
---
Yes, thats called fortification. See any military strategy ever.
---
&gt; Realigned starboard holograms on Permaband premium Skin for the Sabre
---
Thank fuck.
---
How many capitals did you bring to the wormhole? And did you really think that the 5 man gang will fight your formed up 30 person muninn/scimitar fleet?
---
 Dont play the humble card. Lmao u probly got every tiny percentage u could from VA.
---
Tell that to high sec tax income
---
Retention of high skill/high activity players
---
I've been away for ages and I'm just spinning back up. I see in the patch notes thread that they nerfed booshing.  
---
What is booshing? It seems like a null sec PvP tactic, but I can't really glean the exact technique from people's complaints about it.
---
The downside to this is that moving lone supers and titans becomes very safe.
---
Happy Veterans Day, minus those who repeatedly demanded/requested to be discharged due to bone spurs. 
---
Your president is a real fucking hero man
---
I’ve seen soldiers get deployed with far more than bone spurs
---
Fuck your messiah, he’s a dumb fucking cunt
---
Where's the caldari kamikaze plane?
---
Get into wormhole exploration. Make some of the best isk you can starting out. Get blown up. Chat up the player who blew you up and ask for tips in PvP. Possibly get a reccomendation to join his wormhole corp. If not ask to join his corp or another.
---
K
---
looks like he struck a nerve huh krab
---
I kind of wish that anchoring had limits across the board - it'd be a lot more interesting if fleets were forced to spread out, have multiple anchors/formations, etc.
---
&gt; But why?
---
Lots of new players freakout because they asked a question in the rookie help chat, then someone put a bounty on them for no reason. Since they're new, they don't know that a 100k bounty doesn't mean shit. This can scare off new players. Making the minimum 1 mil makes this behavior less likely on the part of the bounty-ers.
---
The mechanic that allowed the 1/4 to remain neutral to us. Damn it!
---
How does that prevent you from booshing your entire logi wing with the first boosh? Unless you're going to have all of your logi try to scram each other too?
---
At a certain point we're all gonna look like Charlie with the red yarn/thumbtacks setup on our walls just to figure out who is supposed to be scramming who.
---
it could also basically be an excuse to ban literally every group that has ever run incursions.
---
since, you know, literally all of them dump spare alts in to the first room of a site once it's nearly completed to get payouts if they aren't running a full fleet. i've never known a group that runs regularly that hasn't done this.
---
we do a lot of NPSI shit out of our WH.  We shoot a lot of nullbears. Hit me up if you want to know more.
---
In most cases, first offenses are met with a temp ban. Don’t know if they changed that policy, with regard to bots or not, though.
---
This is so true. If they really want to quick fix the meta, make dreads do 5x damage to supers and titans (yet don't do anything more to smaller hulls). This would make any half competent dread bomb capable of blowing up the super fleet, while at the same time being deleted by the subcap fleets.
---
I would recommend "Inside the volcano" (https://insidethevolcano.com/) . It's not cheap, but it's an absolutely stunning experience, and due to the way you enter it, it's guaranteed to be not busy inside, so you can enjoy it without big groups of people annoying you.
---
right click on a ship, compare.
---
drag any ship you want in to the new window that pops up.
---
I would think the cost of ammo would make an exotic plasma ship less than viable for Emerging Conduits. An Ikitursa can do it too, but it's like \~15mil cost for ammo per site. And 12 minutes? Holy cow, 12 minutes is a long time to be sitting in a barrel running a bling fit PVE runner. I've tried every ship I can think of to solo these. (Without having to warp out. Because if you have to warp out, you're doing it wrong.)
---
Nothing I have tried is as fast or as cheap as the Rokh. With Large (medium) Neut blasters, I can run sites in 6-6.5 minutes and a cost of Null M ammo of around 20k per site. And no downtime between sites. Full shields and cap when the next conduit pops. Super fast, super cheap. (The cost for ammo is cheap, not the ship build). Gila, Vindi, Golumn and Rattlesnek are all good solo conduit ships, but much slower and more expensive. 
---
I didn't mention the Praxis, because the Praxis is stupid.
---
o7
---
I wonder why tapi are complaining about being dropped but literally do the same when ever horde goes in their space.
---
Since when did we have supers?
---
Disassociate yourself from LEGACY/TEST and you might be given actual content.
---
Its only bad when others do it to them, when they do it it is always justified.
---
Never not upvote Letterkenny
---
omg somebody got blobed by supers/titans in nul CCP what do.
---
Legacy members need to realize that they are associated with tapi. Being associated with tapi makes you being super dropped, okay.
---
If this applies to groups holding alts on the gate then literally everyone has does this lmao, calling this an exploit is dumb as fuck. When you have an incursion in your space the only way to actually get a proper payout as a small group is to do this.
---
Fucking amarrian scumbags.
---
Wow tapi is really out of touch with reality.
---
That isn't what this is referring too, also reading until the end of the article could help...
---
So wait now super drops are a problem, like really?
---
It isn't
---
I roam Vale around autz solo and it's pretty dead. There's ratting activity, but very hard to get those people to fight you. Usually more fights come through tribute.
---
There's a stratios/nado/scyfi combo camping c2x in tribute a lot these days. Hard to get them to fight though.
---
You can rationalize and prioritize all you want.  I don't want to argue that.  I guess I could argue that stimulating pvp is the most important thing.   However, I do firmly believe that Not 1 or 2 things are going to fix pvp no matter how profound.  It will require multiple things to change.  Multiple interconnected things with the goal of stimulating pvp and conflict.  Or it will fail.  It might generate excitement for a time but after a few months it will fail because the fallbacks and work arounds still exist.
---
https://i.redd.it/y7c5rhbyknz21.jpg
---
To everyone upvoting this but are part of an alliance with more than 2,000 members: leave your bloc now. Join a smaller one. You're part of the problem.
---
Tikle was right
---
(for leaving the tapi cancer, they are wrong as an entity however)
---
Given how lazy ccp seems to be lately, the easy way is to just make a new module for HIC bubbles that kills boosh modules. They could play with the bubble size till it was in a good place for balance. They could do the same thing with interdiction probes if they wanted to make it something you could spam all over the grid.
---
What would be really cool is a deployable or maybe a battleship module that acted like a drag bubble for booshes. if boosh is activated within range of the anchored or active module, it takes you there instead of 100k ahead of the boosher. or even make it a burst projector charge.
---
The last thing eve needs is to have more things nerfed and simplified.
---
have you been on r/eve before?
---
No, It's by far the worst one I have seen so far.
---
My opinion is that people who wanted covert cynos for JFs either A) don't have JFs or B) have only 1 JF and don't know anything about pvp.  Both of those group's opinions on the matter should be not relevant.
---
I see.
---
