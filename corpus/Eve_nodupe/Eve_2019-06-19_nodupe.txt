In a month we’ll all be asking “Where’s NC.”
---
---
---
C4s are for Marauder's.
---
In a c4 you'd use Marauder's.
---
&gt;And when you have pilots as a limiting factor, it's not a good strategic move to write off a good part of your fleet as already lost at the moment the battle begins, unless you KNOW that that write-off will entirely pay for itself because it will do some back-line surgical strike that your main fleet wouldn't be able to.

---
To be fair, the original design with titan clone bays and fleet hangars was pretty much *the* solution to this issue, except back then people flew subcaps and you could actually store a few in each titan.
---
Jump clones and dread caches will be left behind
---
You can just hit v to dscan. Don't need to click

They’ll make more isk in that month than they made in the whole year in high sec where they came from

Very good!

Have you tried not being toxic cunts in local?
---
Might have been a line there... couldn’t tell from all that rape talk
---
Out of a lot of "EVE Paintings", i think this is one of the best i've seen. You're attention to detail is impeccable and the perspective is spot on. Awesome work!
---
Sweeeeeeet
---
No, it's just a new beginning.?
---
That's one thing I never understood about electric shields in fiction. Yes it could stop or dampen the effects of matter based weapons, but if the shield itself is transparent, how would it be effective against electromagnetic waves? I'm not critiquing games per se, as it would take a lot of extra coding and a lot of extra processing power to calculate that in real time, but in other forms of fiction a shield shouldn't be able to completely absorb a laser.
---
I prefer T3Cs. You do need a shield or armor hole tho.
---
They refused any of those times to form armour
---
How embarrassing. So is panfam moving to npc fountain now?
---
yea, umm.. sorry about that.
---
But to be fair, you quit because it was boring.
---
So maybe you should do the pvp thing this time.
---
pretty sure youre confused on WH gas sites
---
Tristan vs daredevil is pretty favored for the Tristan, not much bling needed but good drone skills with fast light drones like velspa can make quick work if you fly correctly
---
Agreed. But there are people that involved in the game despite what we all think people should and shouldn't do.
---
&gt; Many wars and deployments later
---
I don't remember NC going on any deployments except to their krab lands
---
We have wh huffing guides at www.youtube.com/thebravedojo and yes sleepers are wh NPC faction.  Low sec gas sites are drug gasses , not the same as wh gas.
---
Made me laugh out loud in the middle of a restaurant.....not sure i want to explain
---
Myrmidon is ok for c3 gas sites.
---
Same
---
lol it cracks me up when I hear this, in comms and in jabber. Like really?
---
Yet PL still lost
---
God can you biter old vets fuck off already I’m having fun.
---
Did they redeploy to amamake yet?
---
I think the joke is on us for assuming he meant wisdom and not some other kind of \~meta\~ belief

What about mails from GMs saying "you were reported"
---
Supercapitals are like dick size. Nobody is gonna give you the real number
---
Lol there so many salt posts like this, people are butt hurt at us goons lolxD
---
Well now.......perhaps this server needs to be shut down. You won goons. Why bother playing anymore.
---
feel like i should make sure you understand that no one cares. we are doing our own thing. we left due to shit mechanics, and went across new eden to start again. we literally dont care about anything that happens in the warzone at this point
---
I appreciate the kind words. 
---
&gt; I am happy for my Goon enemy's as I know right now you are having a great time steam rolling the North.
---
I think we all would be happier if we were fighting it out, instead of just stomping sandcastles.
---
Neil Asher?
---
\*insert "not-bad" face here\* :+1:
---
It would give people something more concrete to fight over that doesn't require a supercap umbrella nearby. This would be great for local groups who don't need to project power.  
---
Will large groups try and control them? duh. But they won't always.
---
Imagine not caring when your game with 22k concurrent players, so many of which are second or 3rd accs plexed leave the game. Another day in this madhouse.
---
Yeah imagine how much safer delve would be with umbrellas operating in the adjacent regions.
---
I laughed more than I should have. Thanks! :D
---
Shut up
---
After listening to this over speakers I was apprehended by a joint task force of NATO troops and UN Peacekeepers for violating the Geneva Conventions
---
Bet you they'll skyrocket after the war, anyone who was burnt out on krabbing just got their break.
---
Imagine hanging your only successful game because you don't know what you're doing for 2+ years
---
They would probably get evicted by Gang Bang Team at this point.

Jokes on you, I only played at 60. (But yeah, rose coloured glasses and all that)

---
This is a pilot I waited 45 minutes inside his mission to kill
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77280215/
---
This is a pilot I was lucky to kill because he used two and because they didn't slide at the same time I was able to catch the slowest one. 
---
Anyone is welcome to check the vote section where my proposal on missions:
---
It is a means to end the krabbing but requires the hunter to do a little work and the mission runner to stand their ground and fight. 
---
Pilot Name: Matthew Dust
---
SubCommittee: Missions
---
Proposal: Put "Standings Based" fleets inside the missions. For Example in a mission. both an Amarr Fleet and a Minmatar Fleet who shoot the player based on standings. Standings hits are received for shooting at the rats. If the runner's side of the fleet is destroyed, the mission is failed.
---
Intended Purpose: To add counter play to mission runners, they can still earn heaps of Loyalty Points, but now when chased out of the mission they risk the hunters killing their side and a failed mission with no payout. Currently if they are chased out and the rats are destroyed. their mission is complete (except for a few which require you to loot.)
---
Who does it affect outside of Faction Warfare: Anyone who hunts Mission Runners
---
How does it affect them: Standings hits.
---
I am sorry I missed out on daoc, doubt we will we a game like that again.
---
Don't forget that many goons stockpiled to profit off that rise in mineral cost. It'd be tough to estimate how much already mined ore could be unloaded at higher prices, but that'll put a dent in the opportunity cost of war too.
---
There's always Curse for alliances that used to be relevant

500 Dreadbomb Nags lose to 100 Apostles + 100 Avatars. (33 Avatars and FAX fleet destroyed best case scenario) 
---
So yeah, Titans fleets are pretty unassailable once you have critical mass of them.
---
Fedup was kind enough to let us build capitals which are mostly in the warzone now, I had told their ceo we would only be there for a short while. that chimera was used in defense of a citadel, a citadel in detorid, which is frat space, I dropped it to defend a test citadel and failed.
---
That said as a csm candidate all playstyles need to be listened too, and I think if you read my ballot suggestions this would've been obvious.
---
How will a free for all work in HS? Sounds fun, just curious. Are we all going to take one tritanium out of a dropped can and go suspect or what’s the plan?
---
Just staging everyone there not going to disclose the actual spot so we dont have a bunch of neutrals waiting to smartbomb hehe
---
That was my next question :) but yeah, sounds fun. I’ll try to fit it in my schedule.

That was my next question, lol. But sounds fun, I’ll try and fit it in my schedule

This is gold.

they can easily be stopped, they're a big lumbering oaf and while they're busy hitting your worthless structures you can bag a trillion in killmails in a week in delve

you don't need to stop them- they're free content

the real way to do a noobship duel is to have everyone make an alpha clone, but it into a corp, and turn friendly fire on, and put it in jita in an undisclosed safespot

Might end up doing this at some point could be fun. Just have it for shits and giggles public events
---
Cleared it up to say it's staging. First thought I had too. Let's all fight in corvettes where nobody can kill anyone fast enough to beat concord.

You were banned, because you didn't follow the rules. Not for your religious spam, your hatred of missions, or any of your ideas, which are still in the vote section.

angel space is probably great for them.

Why on earth do you want to bring real life politics into this or any game. Games are about escaping real life, forgetting your troubles, and just enjoying an escape into the world of fantasy. Why ruin eve with real political nonsense when there's plenty of in game political nonsense to be had.

I read somewhere for a rundown on weapons in The Expanse that the energy yield of a nuke in space is 10% of the yield at sea level in an atmosphere. Most of the damage will be from thermal energy, rather than concussive force.

Any battlecruiser should do fine for all but c5 gas.

So what you're telling me is that the wheel thing that's spinning on the side of an Erebus is in fact a particle synchrotron accelerator.
---
"recently"
---
we are at like 12 months since PL/NC retreated in the south. Since then the only time we batphone goons is when NCPL is the other side's batphone?
---
I wouldn't take that bet - you're most likely correct =)
---
This is bait. This isn't even good bait. He just threw the whole rod in.

This is either

You used quotations like air quotes, which have the following definition:
---
a pair of quotation marks gestured by a speaker's fingers in the air, to indicate that what is being said is ironic or mocking, or is not a turn of phrase the speaker would typically employ.
---
You know, that makes sense. Get that much antimatter that quickly in such a (relatively) small area does seem bonkers. They've got to be gathering and storing it as they fly.
---
So yeah. That makes things more terrifying. Because every Erebus everywhere is emitting fuck loads of EM energy. All the time.
---
No wonder they couldn't dock.
---
Back then was one of the most fun times I had mainly because I got to fight with and against most of the major powers. When BoB/IT was finally dead as a major power I was kinda sad because I had so much fun fighting with and against them.
---
I have no hatred toward any entity because without them it would just be a one sided circle jerk. The conflict BoB created back then was just amazing and I have not seen anything really like it since then because Sir Molle/Shrike was so good at what he did to both inspire and enrage people.

I bet the majority of Eve's planetary population eats some cheap synthetic protein paste and could only hardly afford natural dairy products.

Im discussing everyone's opinion, including both the mission runners who believe pve has a place in fw and the "delete missions" crowd like Templar Dane who presented screenshots, of how absurd and broken the system is in a constructive manner. I eagerly await his proposal.
---
As for minerals affecting the LP store, if the cost of minerals decreased due to abundance, how would that not affect the cost of ships required to make faction ships? It's small, but as they say, save the pennies and the dollars take care of themselves.
---
So you're saying the colonisation of New Eden was spearheaded by IKEA?
---
&gt;I acknowledge that they do in fact function in space  
---
&gt;

This, this is good
---
You are giving CCP way to much credit here
---
weak
---
So true it hurts :'(
---
She spelled it right, the m is just upside down.
---
If CCP marketed only towards autists I bet they'd have far more success.
---
A simple solution to that is just to assume that the inertia of the massive starship combined with the drag on spacetime provided by the warp drive largely cancels out the recoil from the guns. We have Higgs Anchors and presumably some form of Star-Wars-style "inertial stabiliser" to prevent our crewmembers from being liquefied by the hundreds of Gs small vessels pull in maneuvers, so something like that could be used to counteract the recoil.
---
Confirmed troll haha
---
ANTI-religious spam, thank you.  
---
As I mentioned before, there is zero room for argument that facwar missions don't need their income nerfed.  Even as you gaped in awe at the true magnitude of facwar mission income, you managed to back-bend around to a "Lol Rorqs inflate LP" pretzel to avoid acknowledging what everyone else in facwar knows by heart, that mission income needs a nerf bat.  
---
There is no "it's just a playstyle" argument.  It would be like an interceptor pulling into random null regions, producing billions of ISK worth of compressed ore, and when Rorq pilots and everyone else who mines in the game says that this is absurd, calling interceptor mining "just a different playstyle" like it doesn't completely wreck everyone else's playstyle.  Time after time after time you buy this crap argument, and the only logical inference I can make is that you are a mission loving RMT apologist afraid &amp; unwilling to say what is true when called upon.
---
Assuming the future of EVE is as grimdark as it purports to be, that's likely true. Organic food is going to be a luxury in this particular future and it's likely that real, non-vat-grown food is a premium commodity.

To be fair, when dealing with weapons this absurdly powerful, that *is* the good news.

Only common among Goons. Everyone else calls it what it is actually called =\]
---
I always assumed that the visible portion of the beam that we see is just the targeting laser, and that the actual weapon is in the microwave/x-ray/gamma range.
---
Why is it only Imperium, Legacy and Darkness are the only ones with comparable numbers? It's like the other half of the universe refuses to do any sort of empire building.

No it's me, Patrick.
---
If you're bombarding a planet with these things, the effects of atmospheric contamination are honestly negligible.
---
Did you read past that part?  Doesn't look like you did.
---
&gt; As for minerals affecting the LP store, if the cost of minerals decreased due to abundance, how would that not affect the cost of ships required to make faction ships? 
---
The relative dilution from mineral supply inflation is impossible to approach LP supply inflation.  Take the argument to the edge case.  Assume infinite Rorqs and minerals are free.  Players still want VNI's, implants, faction mods.  Even if the mineral supply was inflated to infinity, we would make ISK due to the independence of the LP supply.  Inflate the LP supply and our profit drops to near zero on top of mineral cost.  It is not the same thing.  It is not the same thing.  The relative supply &amp; demand between LP &amp; minerals are almost completely independent.
---
The only thing I would disagree with is MM's elitism. They weren't elitist. Or even that good. In the old NC - Razor was considered the PvP alliance of the coalition, while MM was the leading one. Their leadership sure was arrogant though. No arguing that.

You realize that there are barely any ratters in Delve, and haven't been for the last month or more. The ratting numbers you see is simply a few turbokrabs with VNIs, cause only an idiot would rat with a capital in Delve right now.
---
This game is about people who go around and casually exchange nuclear weapons when they're bored. And that's just frigate PVP.
---
USA # 1
---
Ok it's early morning but I'll try and point this in the direction I'm headed.
---
LP&gt;BUY 500 VNI BPCS&gt;MOVE THEM TO JITA&gt;MANUFACTURE THEM IN THE ASSEMBLY PLANT&gt;SELL ON MARKET.
---
Look at your wallet and see how much you've made in a short amount of time because you didn't have to haul established hulls or sell them in one of the "dying" hubs.
---
now try that in hek or rens with the cost of minerals there, even if you somehow had the exact same buyer, you'd be making less than jita, because the cost of minerals is higher.
---
This is why I say the cost/availability of minerals affects the LP Store, the same as the NEXUS Chip market.If the cost of the Nexus Chip goes up, you either need to grind them yourselves or buy the inflated cost of nexus chips that happen in t4 all the time and then adjust the cost of your final product
---
Too slow. Better off in a C3
---
Argument is invalid and relies upon regional variations, not mineral supply inflation.  Ship VNI BPC's to null.  Profit 2x.  It's apples to oranges in both our examples.  What we know for certain is that Rorqs have nothing to do with LP inflation that gets VNI's down to ~50m every cycle.  The relative magnitudes of the changes are almost not even on the same order.
---
meh

"It's totally a great game guys it puts EVE to shame.....or...you know...it's like....getting there. They've been developing it for 7 years on a never-ending flow of crowdfunded money and microtransactions but didn't you hear them say that some other games can take 10 years to make? That means this is all completely fine.  Plus we've got another expansion scheduled for summer 2020 and those usually come out close enough to the announced release date.  I mean, come on guys, the game has a lot more depth and immersion because you can, like, walk around your ship and do.....like....stuff...while looking at things. That's what makes a game great guys."

I'm convinced that when you download Scam Citizen to your computer a few days later ninjas sneak into your house and put prions into your brain that prevent you from criticizing anything about Scam Citizen's gameplay, development cycle, or monetization practices while filling you with an unquenchable urge to passive-aggressively shill Scam Citizen to the playerbase of every other "space game" on the internet.

I’m with you, it shouldn’t be that hard. Yet people have trouble remembering to not turn off an MWD when anchoring, let alone managing to properly press a button when they’re supposed to and having the right thing selected (see latest skillu video where NC DD the wrong fucking bus)
---
If i needed proof that i'm a degenerate, the fact i find this funny should suffice.
---
&gt; So yeah. That's that. RIP everything. Gallente master race.
---
meanwhile Minmataar just has a 15km long stick full of fuel and AK rounds
---
Guess PL and NC. helicopterdicking every small and up and coming alliance over the last five years was not good for the game. 
---
WHHHAAATTT?
---
Is index really that big an issue? My only industry experience was my own POS in Perimeter back before complexes allowed anyone to manufacture anywhere, so i don't think the index was much of a factor and i did fine at the time
---
This.... This is what haunts my dreams
---
Cruiser sites are still about 75mil on average (over an appropriately large dataset) and can be completed in 8-12 minutes, netting you several hundred mil ISK an hour; I am personally making 400-600m/hr. If you happen to have three accounts that can fly Hawks, and the desire to engage in that playstyle, you can make more ISK per hour triple boxing Hawks in Chaotic Dark sites. Outside of that, it's all either for fun/challenge, or for practice.
---
Gila and Hawk are the ISK printers, but Sacrilege, Vagabond, and Cerberus for cruisers, and Retribution for frigates, are all very viable choices and very fun to fly.
---
who the fuck do you think we are

we have been deleting SMA space and talking crap to them in local.

Ore/anom respawn time based on the farm of a constellation &gt; région if a system is overfarmed it deplete in the entire constel, then affect the entire region  = more spread, no more umbrella

I'm waiting for the unirionic "you guys should've turtled up and krabbed for 3 years while recruiting everyone who has a pulse" but tbh that is fair to say as they should've adapted to the new gay meta which is n+1 supers

---
PanDaFam
---
The cure = Disbanded
---
Please point on this nyx where the Dread uncles touched you
---
Guardians of the Imperium Legacy now have more pilots and active titan numbers than if every neutral coalition joined PandaFam and if every single independent alliance and lowsec alliance also joined them. (snuff etc.)
---
For all intents and purposes with the way the current game works, titan numbers supercede everything, and nullsec infrastructure and rorquals snowball exponentially. The south has a monopoly on the production of Titans and if you look at the economy statistics of the game you'll see that Imperium Legacy out produces PandaFam by a factor of about 4 to 1.
---
In short, we have reached the breakeven point where even a WWB/Casino War Mob style attack can bring this mega coalition down and by the end of 2019 if trends continue, not even multiple defections will be able to achieve anything.
---
Either CCP, Test or Goons change something by the end of 2019 or we will have serenity 2020 in nullsec.
---
Yeah, only Goons call it the Casino War. Nice try though
---
Now I cant imagine doing it any other way
---
Untill dreads out damnage titans by a lot. *There about even with gun dps* .
---
I don't see how titans are just gonna be a better choose.
---
They have more tank, buff Fields, large single or aoe burst damage weapons, can't get reps while doing there damnage an tanking and can be moving to lower the damnage done *aka abs*. 
---
Dreads ever need to be able to move and mitigate damage while doing there cap damnage, an be able to be repaired while doing so.
---
Or be able to do so much more damnage that there lack of tank and cost is worth it.
---
Right now all they have is there cheeper.

Everytime goons deploy reddit have a spike of that kind of post so well..
---
This is a post worthy of reposting forever
---
&gt;Is it a positive thing when the game is now so limited and monotonous?
---
If you split the game into two, isk-making and the rest, then the isk making is waaaaaay less monotonous now. 
---
I still remember how it was to finish one of those loooooooong ass skills you needed before your alt was capable of doing its part (JDC5, some industry skills, all those refining skills, and the odd semi-long skill outside your attribute map, etc). 6 months or 2 years training and then during the last weeks its still useless until certain skills are done. That's how it was back then. All the while you have ground the isk to plex those alts. 
---
Now you can instead just make some extra isk and inject that last bit and start using your alt for its intended purpose. 
---
And remember when you missed a skill and had to wait for it to train after you thought your alt would be complete? 
---
And remember how useless nullsec industry was? 
---
Do you remember reaction POSes? 
---
Do you remember fueling POSes on the other side of the galaxy because no fatigue meant people owned POSes on good moons across many regions if they had a supercapital force no one else could match? 
---
 Do you remember warping back and forth with ore a thousand times with your darn barge (or battleship if you go way back and didn't have the isk to plex a hauler alt yet)?
---
Do you remember belt ratting? 
---
Do you remember someone taking your industry slots in a highsec station then suddenly you have to move all your stuff worth millions of m3? 
---
Do you remember refitting carriers? 
---
Do you remember tracking titans? 
---
Do you remember when people (mostly leaders who farmed moons) was so afraid of having their magic isk faucets taken away that they would fine you and kick you and berate you if you lost some ships that were a bit too shiny, because you had tons of isk and wanted to have fun with your isk? Now that doesn't matter, a corp isn't going to get invaded if some of their pilots lose ships having fun. 
---
Do you remember ejecting the titan or super from the POS when it was completed and then it gets bumped without a pilot at insane speed out into space? 
---
Do you remember when not all ships could take gates? 
---
Do you remember when you had to build certain modules to compress ore? 
---
Do you remember mandatory alliance buyback programs at shit prices? (Well, apparently I hear horde still has that, 80% jita on salvage, could be hearsay though)
---
I'm pretty sure that's what blowing these ships up *is*. If you've breached the cargo hold there isn't exactly a lot of finesse involved with "anti-matter annihilation reaction" &gt;.&gt;

Online resources say 15-20 minutes. I've timed a dozen different sites. Pretty much guaranteed to get 20 minutes out of each site. It's between 19:50 and 20:10 every time.

That part is nonsensical, I will agree.

this is so bad it trick my brain into upvoting
---
Imagine being legacy and thinking you need to be friends with goons this long and not having more fun shooting 2 entities
---
No thanks QFC, but hey.
---
I'm sorry but we all have Tumblr accounts and our corp leader Anita Sarkeesian persecutes right wingers.
---
Almost worse than your recent fanfic shit post that are overrated
---
You implied PL were the winners of the game when BL was chopping your dicks off pre-fatigue.
---
Nice, you posted from your main account this time
---
1.
---
Umbrellas are too effective
---
2.
---
Mobile cynojammers are too weak. 
---
3.
---
Resources from anoms are unlimited.
---
4. 
---
Massed titans and faxes are too effective.

**Focusing on the North only, based on your numbers (b/c Test and WinterCo don't really make it up a bunch):**
---
* Goons, INIT, TNT, Bastion &amp; Affiliates(?): **54,824**
---
* Horde &amp; Pets &amp; Affiliates(?): **34,083**
---
* Difference: **\~20,800**
---
That DeadCo / GOTG backstab by Gobbins n the other PanFam diplomatic brilliance is *really* biting them in the ass, especially observing that most Tribute / Vale / Geminate timers would see better show from DeadCo / GOTG 14,170 than Imperium.
---
It seems they’re trying the “million monkeys with typewriters” method.
---
Wow, elite pvp right there
---
Ever since I started playing this game back in 2006 or something it has ALWAYS been n+1.
---
I used glow in the dark paint on top
---
Mail Joecuster in game, you'd fit in really well with us!
---
Fake and gay
---
Learn to read the rules.  
---
The rule is "The submission of offensive language, links to offensive or obscene material or the masking of obscene language sent to in game chat channels (public and private) by players is not permitted."
---
I didn't imply n+1 was new only that ncpl should've adapted to their new meta which is n+1 SUPERS 
---
But nice reading comprehension retard
---
The middle is looking mighty good.
---
Folks, what decline? Anyone got any stats they want to cite please?
---
pretty sure his post is sarcasm.
---
Maybe you shouldn't read things in that aren't there. Fatigue was introduced to stop the groups with supers dunking on everything anywhere in eve in 10 minutes. Those groups were the winners.
---
Anoms can at least be AFKd
---
When serenity showed that there was nothing preventing the game from going full blue-donut, CCP should have taken notice and changed things to encourage instability over a certain size.
---
Instead, they sat on their hands.
---
It was always N+1, however the current game is N+1 Titans/Rorquals, we have the most accessible nullsec we have ever had in terms of nullsec recruitment yet the barrier to entry to be able to accomplish anything in the game as an aggressor is higher than it's ever been. 
---
The current capital game balance along with citadels means that whoever owns the most titans wins. You get the most Titans by having the most Rorquals. You get the most Rorquals by turtling up, blueing everyone around you and dropping supers on solo caracals in your space so you can continue mining as efficiently as possible. That is the current state of Nullsec Sov Holding 101. 
---
Despite the good changes in March, capitals are still wildly overpowered with their projection and effectiveness vs sub capital ships. 
---
Deny as many fights, roaming gangs and PVPers as possible through use of supercarriers and HAW dreadnoughts which are unassailable under competent capital umbrellas. They also cannot accomplish anything in your space with 3 timer citadels and Ansiblex gates that are protected by Keepstar Doomsdays. This exponentially scales, the bigger the umbrella, the more you can use capitals aggressively against roaming gangs.
---
This is eve online from 2017 to 2019, it will die if it continues this way.
---
The first thing that comes to mind, is fundamentally changing how combat works.
---
In eve, you either survive, and can be fixed trivially, or your ship is destroyed.  I would like to see something inbetween.  Perhaps you got away, but not before your cargohold was blown open.  Perhaps you won the fight, but your ship took permanent damage.
---
I get it, I'm weak at PVP.  Weak to the point that there's no reason for me to ever attempt to fight back, because it won't make a difference in the end.  It won't hurt the person who attacked me.  Make there a reason to go down fighting.
---
Similarly, I'd like to see ships be more expensive, AND less likely to be destroyed.
---
Yes because I care enough to make a alt on Reddit for some half life mmo
---
Get fucked retard
---
Keep Mother Amamake Safe, God Bless
---
It's on then.
---
If you are going to be ninja looting anyway just kill the MTU too, added bonus they give killmails.
---
no!
---
Call Hilmar asap!
---
Is it some secret corp directive that requires each of you to be completely fucking unbearable on every public forum you post on?
---
Astounding
---
lol does anyone remember ccp was sold?  
---
# Pearl Abyss
---
Can confirm I had the most random escalating fight against randoms last week in the system lol
---
it would be hard to actually form 400 dreads for all but one alliance in this game. Plus bosons... 2-3 bosons will kill an entire ball of dreads
---
You trying to reach mittani levels of spin there radakos? You have a lot of learning to do until you reach that point. You tried to flex and got shit on, you left the day you died, you cut off all communications. Stop lying to yourself, or do but stop trying to act like you're worth half a shit.
---
So hypothetically let's say what would hangry if Titans were deleted tomorrow? We'd see a super carrier race and the same scenario would happen or some other ship. I think the problem is the cultures. The blocs that protects it's miners, let's production flourish, plans for the long term and chooses it's fights wisely is the one that succeeds.
---
2 bil tengu can do it, but still it can’t stand up to the 10 gankers who will inevitability show up.
---
Love it!
---
Save yourself a lot of time and use Eve Isk per hour. Look into t2 production instead of t1.
---
OHHHHHHH his doing so well &lt;3 
---
i too am learning but will take a while to do it, in my marshal too
---
You're just mad because your ebin coalition couldn't even organize it's self to counter us have fun with the North burning
---
If goons are going to flex their economic might, their enemies might as well flex about goon’s economic losses.
---
Evicted or disbanded?
---
Do you really believe that GOTG would make any significant difference in the way this war is turning out? Not only would they not make up the difference in numbers you list here, but they certainly wouldn't make up for the difference in Titan numbers which is what ultimately matters in the end. In case you weren't paying attention they were still on the panfam side for the fade war and that didn't go well for the north either. Not to mention after the fade war they had pretty much no reason to stay aligned with panfam anyways as it became pretty clear that panfam couldn't protect them from the Imperium.
---
citadels were a mistake
---
Is it finally time to flex my Taipan?
---
next week maybe ;)
---
I'm a fucking wormholer you inbred.
---
I like it bruh. Keep making em.
---
There was only heavy lifting on my part. Do you even lift?
---
And I'm not in goons smooth brain learn what flairbait is
---
Lol. Right
---
never happened, they moved out because we moved in next door, thats literally it and this lie that we kicked them out is dumb.
---
imagine calling yourself Northern Coalition. after the best coalition eve ever had.
---
amirite
---
BFF
---
do you think we're poor?
---
They're including HRE and the renters that rented from them to make the numbers seem closer
---
The bounty system needs a revamp, made into a contract-style system ala John Wick
---
GOTG would make zero difference in the northern war right now and anyone who argues otherwise is either dumb or deceptive
---
&gt;Keep Mother Anamake Safe, Bob Bless
---

---
?
---
I wish some game lore was introduced that made production of Titan and SCs no longer possible.
---
This is a fantastic idea imo.
---
Oh but Vily started calling it that, I guess part of the terms.
---
/u/olmecagold please use your CSM status to help make this happen! Make Bounty-Hunting Great Again
---
TAPI wasn't kicked out, they moved out. Conflict was not even with TAPI but co2. TAPI chose to be with co2 and TAPI made that choice voluntarily. TAPI weren't even farmed tbh and at time you didn't give 2 fucks about Brave. So, don't mix up your timelines and facts.
---
8t,
---
the cost of making sure the north's economic output is as close to 0 as possible.
---
that's a bargain, since we know what the theoretical max output of a region is - it's what delve produces. only a fraction of that is being spent to ensure other people's output is near 0 is clearly an absolute steal.
---
\&gt;Casino War
---
lmao
---
What exactly is your point here? I know you don’t control your coalition but you control where you are in the game and your alliance is helping to snuff out one of the last groups that’s not friendly to you.
---
How is the net export / import calculated? Is it tracked if something was created in place X and has been moved to Y and vice versa?
---
TIL TAPIs has been an 'upcoming alliance' for 5 years now and counting.
---
I accepted goons won at x47 last year. Now just trying to have some fun and hopefully they end it and free me if these shackles, sooner rather than later!
---
In before TEST shares complaints and grievances about why the Super blue donut with NCPL didnt pan out but a super blue donut with GOONS did. And how the primary problem in nullsec is not the super blue donut but how the world has been against TEST.
---
I think I may be retarded as I chuckled at this
---
I'm independent. I would be perfectly happy to see both groups split up completely.
---
My point is that there's a very good reason such a large coalition exists to fight NCPL: NCPL's seal clubbing of them made it necessary.
---
People still remember my wormhole nomad guide? Wow.
---
Yeah, I'm still a big fan of the Orca as a mobile platform in wormholes. Ship hangar, refitting services, reasonably quick align with a MWD pulse, and cloakable. You can pack a fair number of cruisers and frigates for the trip and spend months roaming holes and getting up to shenanigans. If I ever burn out on lowsec empire building I'll probably vanish back into the void of wormholes for half a year again.
---
::checks blue list::  
---
looks pretty neutral to me. but hey, drink the kool-aid.
---
if you want to play in wormhole space.... just go and play in wormhole space?
---
Are you retarded?
---
&gt; He literally didn't say anything about Goons
---
he said titan blob, nobody else has a titan blob.
---
it's like trying to say "people with dicks" then pretending you didn't mean men.
---
Nice video. Good to see you guys still going strong.
---
I was going to correct you and say that it's ISIS who did that and CODE is already Space ISIS. But then I remembered that the Taliban also has a record of doing that, so I guess GSF can be Space Taliban.
---
"The south has a monopoly on titan production"
---
That's not what that word means. The north can build titans just as easily, they just choose instead to shitpost on reddit about how goons are ruining everything (by doing exactly what they did for almost a decade). Payback's a bitch. Goons warned everyone what was happening too, you can't say they didn't say it over and over. But hey, I guess it's easier to repeat "spodbrain" over and over rather than adapt to a new meta. Only TEST was smart enough to listen and they're doing pretty damn well for it.
---
&gt; And the resources to field a large battleship fight being unheard of.
---
like there were only meant to be like 10 titans in the entire game?
---
come on dude. repeating the same shit over and over and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.
---
CCP's mindset is stuck in the 2000's.
---
So if you're in the 5% of true neutral entities and we apply that graciously optimistic rule that in any group of people there will be 1%  with questionable decision making and/or being a dumb - that's between 1932 and 2019 players we can have a kick dunking and then vanish into the mists?
---
I think the 5% is pretty attractive.
---
Lol I love it
---
&gt; whoever owns the most titans wins
---
That's been the case forever, the only difference is that injectors and keepstars have made it easier than ever to convert raw industrial output into Titan pilots/spare titans. The maintenance cost price for a titan used to be a titan sitter that logged out per titan, now it's a single Keepstar for as many titans as you are willing to risk.
---
Quite many of us retards here
---
Gotta kill EVE to make money!
---
Can't tell if making subtle joke about own alliance or not.....
---
Way to pine about yourselves :)
---
I know you're using 3-month active stuff, but you should tally up the data from the last year: 4-GB14(2018-07-14) UALX (2018-07-19), MTO2-2 (2019-01-23), X47L-Q (2018-08-08), H-5GUI (2018-11-19). You'll probably get a more accurate data set.
---
You'll probably get a more accurate data set if you use these systems/dates: 4-GB14(2018-07-14) UALX (2018-07-19), MTO2-2 (2019-01-23), X47L-Q (2018-08-08), H-5GUI (2018-11-19).
---
I'm pretty sure other entities do actually have titan blobs. Just not as big as Goons. 
---
If the Imperium never built a single titan, one of them would be would be doing the blobbing instead. It would be the same shit and the game would still be in a bad state.
---
poor guy cant even afford faction smartbombs
---

---
Hey, some of us started as krabs! Not everyone turns into one, you know.
---
If you're bored in the sandbox maybe it's because you choose to play in a boring way.... 
---
I never personally understood the appeal of being just another pilot in a big nullsec group. 
---
Try something new if you don't like what you've got going on currently.
---
look back at that time in 6vdt.
---
it was 1000 megathrons orbiting the station, or so the story goes - the blob was battleships, back then i'm almost certain goons didn't have the biggest titan blob, they just had the biggest blob.
---
it's just gone from a megathron blob to a titan blob.
---

The thing with lowsec is there is barely anyone there so I find it quite safe
---
Yea I mean at this point you have to institute some sort critical mass mechanic to  have any chance of preventing Serenity 2.0.
---
But it’s probably too late already.
---
what is so special about this guy ? I browsed the last 2 weeeks of his KB, mostly corvettes and capsules. smartbombing gates in a very expensive ship ? you can do that in machariel or even cheaper.
---
PGL deployed TEST down to Delve after the Casino War to try to stop them from rebuilding. Panfam thought it would be more fun to evict TEST. How's that decision working out?
---
One day, people will realise the ships that provide a protection umbrella for miners and ratters themselves have jump drives, and could move from Keepstar to Keepstar as the fields exhausted themselves. The moving umbrella would, of course, be notified via pings.
---
But today is apparently not that day.
---
They shouldn't have turtled up. They should've followed goons to Delve and started attacking before they could farm up an extra 800 titans.
---
I seed what you did there.
---
"I joined a goons corp, attempted to log onto the website, found out I was banned, asked the recruiter about this, and was promptly kicked from the corp, and presumably blacklisted from Goons."
---
At a guess they noticed you didn't own a titan?
---
It is foretold that in the winter of 2020 the goonswarm lead blue donut will finally come full circle. 
---
After the blue circle covers all horizon, they will gather in counsel after sunset in a bar in the kalevala expanse, now a thriving titan ratting ground, and will decide to drop all sov at the same time and biomass. 
---
peak concurrent users next morning 1500 - of which 1200 bots that didnt update the sov and about 300 people in wormholes doing bob knows what and living in their own filth. 
---
In its wake there will follow a shitstorm
---
Eve is dead. Dont play
---
The problem is, goons and test hate eachother less than they hate panfam. 
---
Even if that NIP wasnt in place, both want to see panfam burn over anything
---
I reread it and it inspired me to go back in with just a Confessor. I loaded up the backpack for less than 120m and I hope to stay in there for at least a month.
---
Not only that, relations between Test and Goons were degrading before PL decided to invade Tenerifis/Immensea and force the two coalitions together.
---
They could have just waited it out and let the two go to war for real, but they were so blind and so impatient to go back and seal club some more that they did exactly the worst possible thing for themselves and sealed their own fate.
---
Yeah you're right. Anchoring citadels and shooting Brave's fortizar in DO6H-Q was "not evicting." How stoned are you?
---
NCPL was an existential threat to Legacy for a long time. It makes sense, and no reason to turn on them in the middle of Goons burning their mutual existential threat down.
---
Can only hope something happens after this is all done.
---
Fine! I'll just blow them up and take their stuff! God! Lol :P

should I go ahead and bring on the sixth account just to dedicate the hauling from the Orca back to the station

 that would bring my grand total per month to 90 bucks for 6 accounts  or should I rededicate one of my mining barge Pilots into a hauling character

Aren’t they making a mobile game?

"Oh we have both kinds of content. Mining *and* ratting!"

exactly, like including 10 000 fucking HRE renters lmfao do you think theyre gonna use their supers against CFC to defend Panfam structures? PIBC would be completely irrelevant even if they hadn't disbanded.

Risking 8-10b to kill some random pod is way more fun that risking 500mil
---
Here is what I take of this situation.  Alliances who used in game mechanics to build armadas of ships and pull their collective heads out of their ass are still alive.  Alliances who backstabbed everyone and used outside sources to get ISK to make "content" have been shown the door.  Adapt or die.
---
 Let the salt flow......
---
I started this game basically in Test as soon as they got everything in order in Vale of the Silent, I guess.  While I was there PanFam and company cloaky camped us and just ran through Vale shitting on everything, including our wonderful P3EN gate camps because they could.  They evicted C02 and were dropping supers and everything else in Vale during Tribute wars.  We moved started the Indy engine and here we are today.  Wanna cry about how the game is blame the elitists PanFam.............side note, “Hey Doomchimichanga/Garth!  How’d evicting Test out of ESO work out for you?”  Freaking salty dingleberries.
---
gOoN pEt!!1!11
---
Yeah, true. That's mostly from an outsider's perspective, the only time I was with the NC was very briefly with RAGE... About a month before they got steamrolled over by the DRF, if that, so I don't have too much solid knowledge about the culture. I just remember MM having arrogant leadership, and corps with pretty high requirements, at least on paper. They didn't really have the same "The strong survive, the weak will perish" kind of elitist mentality as BoB did, though, just more of a "If you're not with us, you're against" us kind of thing, kind of what I meant by being more NATO about it. Granted it could have also been a product of the times with the Great War and the threat of BoB's 'galactic conquest' ambitions and all.
---
And I never pegged one or the other as being more PvP oriented, I always knew that MM were the political heads, but I also thought they were about even with Razor in terms of combat capability, and had a similar culture. I don't really know as much about those two groups as I'd like to, even as a semi-oldfag. Thanks for shedding a bit more light on that.

yeah like chessur what a fucking f1 monkey noob
---
i could list a lot of less prolific but still well known pvpers who've quit or barely play... the only people that dont think the game is in a bad spot atm are fucking nullbears in blob alliances who're content ratting, mining, or "PvPing" in 1000 man fleets
---
No, dinos are fighting the rest of EVE, you can even ask PGL to share his screenshot
---
Evicted and Disbanded
---
The move announcement came the day after we started moving in, the fortizar died after. You're really fucking stupid if you think an alliance like PL would remove a content farm like Brave or TEST right after moving in.  It would have come months later after the strain got to be too much, you know, like the other times they were shot.

How to CCP under pearl abyss:
---
Ignore the PvP oriented players. Sure, they spend a lot of dough on plex and alts, but that doesn't matter when krabs are spending more dough for injectors and rorq alts.
---
Ignore the stagnation of null sec. After all, krabs thrive in a risk averse, secure environment where they can safely park all of those rorq alts without having to worry about the threat of nonconsentual combat, or losing their farming space. Not while they have an impenetrable super umbrella, citadel spam, and various other mechanics to ensure they can farm as much as they want, whenever they want.
---
Ignore players leaving the game. EVE is an old game that doesn't attract too many young faces because they're all into garbage ass Fortnite clones. Let the krabs continue to plex for their krab alts, until they realize there's nothing left to krab for because they blued the entire galaxy, and everyone worth fighting, or even interested in it, has already left the game, never to return, and then they'll leave too, after we've milked every penny from them, and then we can shut the servers down on a profit.

---
You know you're doing something right when your mere existence elicits oceans of salt. I'm a little envious my man.
---
Nice.
---
Robert Smith's a pretty ugly motherfucker these days, but wikipedia says they're still active
---
What groups have NCPL done that to? Not being a dick, just genuinely curious. I was in HERO back when N3PL were fucking with us hard, but TEST, Brave, and Spaceship Samurai were all pretty well established at the time, and I can't think of another group they did that to.
---
Also I have no idea what that has to do with this post.
---
given that there's tech to manipulate the planck length, which is so regularly employed that nobody is surprised by this anymore, as well a spaceship with an average density of air... i'd say its likely they have also stuff built into their missiles to lower their mass, because space magicks are a thing... though, with the application of the planck length manipulator on the warhead perhaps, things could get even more interesting ;)
---
I think you're forgetting a major part of Eve there, friendo.
---
Are you sure you are in NC? Very kind words. Thank you.
---
Hence why everyone wants to see you risk adverse scrubs burn.  You farmed smaller alliances for content and now it’s coming to bite you off in the arse.  Blame yourselves and quit b1tching like it’s all Goons and Legacy’s fault.  NC./PL are no better than Simple Farmers, risk adverse crybabies that just care about their zkillboards
---
Im in a WH corp atm, currently we're outside deploying to querious to fuck with the imperium for a little bit. lots of experienced guys, lots of money to be made when we move back in officially. I make almost a bil a month on PI alone, on one toon. what TZ are you in?
---
Thought the same .. 5b hull and meta smartbombs what a scrub
---
Goons sit in delve and krab: "Lol spodbrains u can't even fight"
---
Goons go to war: "Lol ur hurting urself by not continuing to krab"
---
Pick a narrative mate; this is some next level spin. Are you advocating for an EVE where everyone just turtles up and krabs 24/7? Or is it just a desperate attempt to spin this embarrassing steamroll as "the north winning the isk war"? The thing you aren't considering is that our infrastructure is still there when we go back, while we've just annihilated an entire region's ability to make isk for months. Losing 10t hurts a lot more to the alliance that can't replace it.
---
Content in Eve comes from wars, and currently none of the big alliances feel like fighting. 
---
You could always try low-sec, there's always some beef going on there.
---
Meme involving Ron Swanson = instant upvote
---
They're incompetent and refuse to adapt to the new meta. It's easier to just bitch about it on reddit and try to get CCP to bring back passive isk, add gold ammo or whatever dumb shit their CSM candidates want.
---
We already have Serenity 2019 in Nullsec. The power ratio between groups opposed to the blue doughnut, vs the blue dougnut, as it is right now, is pretty much the same as it was on Serenity when it died. The only difference is that they have a little bit more sov, for now. We'll see how long that lasts.
---
This would be cool, but there aren’t enough players for both of these regions, if the second one is as big as ours is right now at least
---
Trust in the crust
---
Content in Eve comes from wars, and currently none of the big alliances feel like fighting.
---
Does this factor in the passive training that’s happening in between injectors? That would speed it up some.
---
but goons didn't fight though, in WWB.....  
---
after SMA failcascaded to slyce and tapi started going through vale hitting lawn then bastion there was a mass evac to sarenen for the hostiles to burn through the pos's and sov
---
Lol, I wouldn't include renters as part of megacoalitions. Make it so there's a special category for renters.
---
Waffles, Snuff, Unspoken Alliance, Iron Armada, or a prestigious Wormhole group like Volta, Lazerhawks, etc. If you're really really adamant about Sov Null, Triumvirate or Fraternity.
---
The sov groups obviously aren't nomadic pirates, but they're at least fighting against the odds.  Everyone else I mentioned all have pretty considerable resources and aren't part of a blue doughnut, which not only means more action for you, but you can also be part of the chemo for this game.
---
God, I can't believe I just actually said Snuff was one of the least cancerous options to join. Eve in 2019.
---
what do you mean with: again? i can't recall a time where it was great. it's been a mess before, and at least this way it's not too exploitable. before, you could just have your alt blow up your unfitted frigate or whatever, and claim the entire bounty yourself. the contract style would likely either be too limited to give payouts, or abused in the same way
---
"using all caps is considered spamming"  
---
Good thing goons are probably not even using half of their caps
---
The problem with this is that it asserts that Rorq mining is the sole source of income for these characters, and that alts can do no other mining activity before training into Rorquals. The reality is that in exchange for a month's training time you can get access to *huge* passive income sources through things like reactions, PI, etc.

Hey now... Don't forget ShitPosting!

You and every single other person who plays this game should be punished by it being stagnant and not being able to do meaningful PVP because PL were dicks to BRAVE and TEST 3 years ago don't you know

Do bothhh

Lol wtf are you talking about

I don't even have to try any more, I can literally copy random sentences from wikipedia nowdays. I know this because I have done it a few times.
---
Thanks! You’re right, passive training would shorten the injectors needed. Another way to improve this is to assume passive training to get each character up to a full 180 m3/s. So consider my numbers as a reasonable guess, but an estimate with big assumptions.

No. This tedious boring old shit posting of the sort that is endemic to Reddit. Get over your self entitled spoiled, I want it all my way, bull shit.

You know what's hilarious? We put orbital strike munitions into the game and universe. He's driving a Rokh with _Small Guns._
---
This
---
Yes they can.
---
no, because boredom makes ppl leave. and players are much more valuable than isk
---
I think that's taken into account with the ~2.14 hours of effective mining per day
---
You use words like 'vernacular', but do jot know basic plural form rules in English.
---
before titans &amp; rorquals it was the same argument ~5-6 years ago except with "hard to access space" and "carrier blobs"... it was eventually countered once a few people put a couple brainc ells together.
---
That makes sense. 250 is very small for an alliance let alone a “coalition of alliances.”
---
Seems like you boys are making better use of that pipe anyways.

How is that different from the way it was ...when it was a hugely exploitable joke?

so... pos guns? without the pos restrictions? what could possibly go wrong?!?

skip the middle man, just distribute the mines in space

So this bitches got so big everyone got tired of their shit so they dont go im null sec cuz fk it why lose your stuff again and again.. Now they bitch that its boring..bitch make it fun give smaller alliances hope to achieve something..nothing more annoying that fighting one vs one or up to one vs three but then your 100 buddies join up to gank that one person?? Fuck you all. call it boring and gtfo that way more people can acces resources and have fun.  No you say? Prove me wrong  been playing since 2004 and its the same shit. Since BoB and every other big ass allience..they leaving? Good dont worry the game wont die others will fill in.

Hi so you are at right place

Fed up with large blobs, blue donuts/balls, and New Eden politics? Don’t wanna spend an hour forming for a mandatory CTA that turns out to be another structure timer? Looking for dank frags instead of dank ticks?
---
[Mea Culpa. ](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98592854/)is a fairly young EUTZ lowsec corp formed by a few buddies who enjoy killmails and relaxed comms. We’re small gangers at heart but also take part in larger drops with our new alliance buddies. As of today, we’re proud members of Shoot First which adds a nice little extra to our content portfolio and a couple benefits, too.
---
We’re based in Sinq Laison, super close to the southern warzone. That means content is literally at our doorstep and we harvest it every day. We fly everything from T1 frigates to T2 battleships, caps and often somewhat unusual fits. We don’t really care about ISK efficiency or other metrics of eliteness. So if you want to roam your 4b Marauder, that’s more than fine. If you can and want to fly blops that’s also very welcome.
---
What can we offer?
---
1. Explosions.
---
2. More Explosions.
---
3. Citadels with Clone Bays.
---
4. Alliance SRP on doctrines.
---
5. Moonmining (wtf, not too much pls)
---
What should you bring?
---
1. A good and somewhat mature attitude. This is by far the most important. Eve is a game and should be fun and we don’t want to fly with jerks.
---
2. A strong desire to blow up (player-owned and operated) stuff. This is not a PVE corp.
---
3. Ability to create your own content. We’re a small group and can’t provide free killmails around the clock.
---
4. A good level of skill points. No hard requirement, but we sometimes like to fly fancy stuff.
---
5. A dread alt is not a hard requirement but strongly suggested.

TAPI and Co2 were allies and were evicted by NCPL from Tribute and Vale after one of the moat awesome wars in Eve. Don't be an idiot with statements like this.
---
It was when wars were actually fun, although I was on the losing side and had to leave.
---
I don't think it was up to CCP to have PL and NC. dick over every small entity they could find while conveniently ignoring Goons for the longest time (because of the risk they might actually lose and have a red zkb).
---
Turns out people like to band together when they're attacked and threatened by a common enemy and that's not CCP's fault.
---
Didn't we (TEST) literally ask Panfam to come join us and attack Goons before they managed to finally get settled in Delve?
---
I remember the reply being, "lol, go fuck yourselves" and TEST had a shitty month(ish) "deployment" where we ended up getting our Mach/Gaurdians just hell camped in stations until PGL called it quits.

---
How many active out of those numbers?
---
I just want to say thanks for producing these. As a non-player who follows the subreddits, the lack of good economic care was something that always bothered me.  Dr. EyjoG never seemed to care much for the isk sink/faucet imbalance.
---
Obviously I'm staying away for other reasons (which I've pointed out in other threads...happy to link you if you care to read) but inflation and the end of alliances caring much about losses was part of what made me fall out of love with Eve.
---
Thank you for producing these reports and for watching those wallet numbers climb. At least someone is watching even if nothing is being done.
---
I really love these reports and they are a credit to CCP that they can be made.
---
Takenyfuckingupvoteyougoddamnheathen!
---
Shiva is recruiting atm rebuilding that spirit in NC, drop by our discord for bants some time
---
Please post said warning here. Otherwise we have a hard time believing this is the case.
---
My wallet says otherwise, from the fleet doctrine changes that led to Lenny (or was it Iron?) buying out Jita of Machs a week after the change had happened, to the ceptor fleets, bombers, and standard T1 BS fleets...there was a lot of ships moving through the market for people who were not fighting.
---
Have you accounted for Travel times as rorquals do not mine perfectly at a constant rate. Personally you want to factor a loss of 10% due to moving positions and drone travel time based on shape of rock and distance from rock. You never really achieve a perfect rorq mine condition...
---
So wait which is it did we Farm them to death, or did we kick them out because you can't do both. If all we ever wanted to do was Farm then to death then kicking them out would not have made any sense. It would have been a free Farm. This is the problem with the narrative that's been spun for the years since Test moved out of the North. Old mean Pandemic Legion kicked them out. In what fucking world what that happened, since you would have been able to undock right click jump to and kill something which was at the time our MO.
---
Calling the legion opportunistic faggots, that's one thing, and not untrue. The alliance was built on that, because it was always significantly smaller than everyone else. Shit when I joined it was 800 dudes, fighting Alliance has three to five times our size. Picking a Target that you could kill or feed off of was important. But making up some shit about how we moved into the North and kicked everybody out doesn't make any sense
---
Another good one
---
it also shows the final endgame resullt of CCP ignoring those glorious economic reports they put out.
---
You let people get rich endlessly and they will bring the most expensive stuff forever, period.
---
Titans were always supposed to be too expensive to field lots of. That turned out to be wrong but CCP just went "welp" and never looked at the ramifications of that design concept being wrong.
---
So when economics don't matter, and titans are just 100x more expensive superdreads, you get everyone in titans.
---
Especially when the last barrier to titan ownership, skills, has been destroyed by injectors.
---
Depends on if it's an publicly-open contract or not. There could be a system by where the issuer could assign the contract to one or more people. Individual bounty hunters (or their corporations) could apply to take up the contract and be accepted by the contract issuer.

 [https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk)
---
Yeah, that’s a really good point. Drone travel time, warping to belts, moving to different rocks... it all adds up. I’m assuming a 50% overheard for all that in my calculations. Based on some numbers I’ve gotten from actual rorq pilots, this results in very similar ISK/hour numbers and what they expect.
---
\&gt; Firstly, not everyone in delve is ratting 
---
Not everyone in branch is ratting either
---
\&gt; Secondly, not all of goons live in delve

Not all of ranger regiment live in branch either

---
\&gt; No arguments that branch is filled with turbo bears 
---
That is literally the point of my argument.  At least you get it unlike others in this thread
---
I'm sorry, do you pay 60 bucks a month just to afk mine, presumably in Hisec? That's mind boggling. But I guess if you find that fun, good for you. Have you thought maybe changing your fleet to 1 boosting orca, 1 freighter and the rest in Skiffs?
---
Lol did "timezone mechanics and strategy" help during the fade war? Do "timezone mechanics and strategy" allow you to win a prolonged fight against an enemy that both has hundreds of titans more than you and is much more capable of replacing them? Please do go ahead and explain in depth how "timezone mechanics and strategy" would enable GOTG to be the deciding factor in this current war, I'll wait.
---
are you?
---
you are completely 100% wrong. I 2 cycle every bastion with 3 nags. you are clearly doing something wrong with bastions.
---
That’s very true. The player could be extracting skills, doing PI, reactions or other industry, or any number of other things.
---
My goal was to measure what a rorqual could do, and that’s why I kept it only at the rorqual’ mining yield. Other ways a player could do better than my estimates would be to cherry pick rocks or do any moon mining at all.
---
It's called a transfer frontier and if you have a big baddie next door, yeah you're gonna gobble
---
I'm sure Goons will remember your post and welcome you with open arms.
---
I'm sure you're capable of using your brain to imagine how a system could be designed to actually support bounty hunting as a legitimate career path, with enhanced incentives, and necessary protections in place to help keep it from being exploited freely. Nothing saying that the current mechanic of 20% of loss value payout couldn't remain. Contract issuers could have the option to only accept certain individuals or corporations to take up the bounty, which could also be tied into a kill-rights to allow for no concord intervention. As it stands, the vast majority of kill rights today are pretty much scammers trying to bilk people out of their ISK and aid insurance fraud.

Tbf we rarely see people bitch and whine about people running 10 accounts with reactions and PI but a massive amount of tears and salt about the Rorq alts. How many accounts do you run and do you feel that income should be nerfed too then?
---
Your optimism disgusts me.
---
About 570GJ, IIRC.
---
&gt; 300 people in wormholes doing bob knows what and living in their own filth.
---
Wormholers disgust me. They will enter any hole without a second thought. Truly disgusting people.
---
/s
---
"doing pretty damn well" they have been fighting frat for half a year now with no true actual impact. it amazes me so many players stay in test and goons. theres so many people and theres hardly anything to even do out there
---
The issue is not necessarily the income but the minerals that can be extracted. The massive amounts of Rorq proliferation have created a capital-heavy meta, given that caps are so incredibly inexpensive.
---
Agreed. That's where apps like [TOTP Authenticator](https://www.binaryboot.com/totp-authenticator?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=totp-promo) help, which allows you to create a backup of your accounts locally/ offline. You can store this backup where ever you want and use it later to restore your accounts if needed. Best of both the worlds imo.

I think increasing dread up might be better damage is ok just need to survive longer.
---
2021? this could basically be tomorrow
---
If Panfam Affiliates includes B0T this list is plain wrong. We’re a liability, not an asset.
---
I played eve back in the time (like 4 years ago).
---
At this time having a rorqual in POS to boost everybody in the system was not that easy. 
---
When mining with rorqual became a thing ? 
---
How people can do that without being killed ? There is no red guys roaming and killing them ? 
---
I just don't understand how that thing can be real and it just make me want to go back to eve and mine in rorqual.
---
USTZ
---
Just like bob would kill eve back in the day
---
Give it a few weeks and PanFam will invade Winter Coalition.  So really we can add Winter Co to the The Blue Team.
---
Thanks, I'm leaning towards Waffles, Snuffed Out, or Iron Armada. I would join a WH group but I know nothing about wormholes and my only experience with WH corps was me getting rejected from Wormbro as a new player because I had too much ISK so I must've been a spy. 'sighs'.
---
This game has never been fun
---
so about 180k dead alts
---
TIL NCPL is a new alliance and they haven't been dicking small entities with titans.
---
fly safe lmao nais bait
---
They would provide numbers to support NCPLHorde during times a lot of our dudes are at work / asleep. This would allow NCPLHorde to time all the sov and infrastructure structures to these time zones knowing they would be able to overcome the Imperium numbers at that specific time.
---
It's really not that complicated of a strategy and concept, I'm not sure why you're having trouble understanding this. Stop huffing glue or whatever it is degrading your intellect.
---
Mhm don’t care :)
---
Naglfry machine broke
---
There are some other low sec entities that could use a mention like Shoot First, Siege Green, Fweddit Ect. Out of them I only know for sure that Shoot First has a good resource structure that I think OP was talking about. 
---
I don't know if Iron Armada truly deserves to be on your first list due to the fact we do own Sov in Fountain and have the baggage that comes with that. The others though are all solid corps with their own things going on. Iron try and spend most of the time outside of Fountain shooting things because if we sit in Fountain people go inactive. That said if you are interested I will shameless plug our really shitty website https://www.iron-guard.net
---
Disclaimer: I am in Iron Armada working with Shoot First at this time to have space fun with Snuff.
---
&gt;after we started moving in
---
&gt;PL didn't evict anyone
---
So maybe you aren't aware how sov works in Eve. When one group lives in a system, and another group tries to move into that system, that's called an eviction. 
---
And no, brave didn't just decide to move as soon as you dropped an Astrahus. I was in the battle to save the fortizar. No orders were given to pack up or firesale or anything. We were told quite the opposite, in fact. I remember Fidelity Diamond hot dropping battle rorqs on us daily. We didn't move out, you moved in. And like   PL does, you tried to destroy everything in your way, even if it hurts you in the long run. 
---
PL dug their own grave.
---
This is peak autism in play
---
I mean I've thought about it quite a bit, and it's not easy. I dont think allowing the bounty payer to vet the killer is a viable system because we have 50,000 people in the game at any time and the odds youre going to know and trust the person who killed your target is essentially zero.  So it becomes a method for scamming again where you have a legitimate-looking bounty hunter org who just splits the take with some of their targets and hunt others.  There is no way for the bounty payer to know the killer well enough to say whether that's occurring or not.
---
This is the fundamental reason that the original payout system was replaced by a payout associated with the loss caused, so that splitting the payment could never be economically advantageous.
---
Lol at begging for handouts from Goons or CCP. 
---
I disagree that only CCP, Test or Goons need to change something, NCPL have it in their power to influence things... If they opened up recruitment, created an equivalent to Karma Fleet, Dreddit, Brave Newbies etc etc to bring in lower skilled players then they could start developing their super fleet of tomorrow. More players would also mean stronger subcap fleets. For too long NCPL have seen newer players as a hindrance and stuck to a vouch only system which was a massive act of self-harm. Now as their empires come crashing down around them, they are begging CCP to help them rather than helping themselves! That's just inept leadership.
---
Mmm...mlem...

Who said anything about PL's decisions making sense? That's the problem. Your choices don't make sense. You attack test and then bitch that they're joining up with the other group that hates you to fight against you. It doesn't make sense. You do whatever the hell you want and act like there won't be any consequences. 
---
You're like the new D&amp;D player who wants to play chaotic evil because they think it's cool to try to be *edgy* but in reality you're just going to end up dead when the town guards have had enough of your shit.
---
How are the new stacking penalties implemented? What formula are you using there? There was a thread about dreads vs titans and for that it would be important. See https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c25lqx/the_age_of_the_dreadnaught/#eri6f41
---
The reason I am "having trouble understanding this." is because the exact strategy you described already failed during the Fade war. You are literally saying that if we had GOTG Goons wouldn't try that in AUTZ, but in the Fade war we had GOTG and it made no difference to the outcome AUTZ or otherwise.
---
Having been evicted by PL twice and lost a super in the process in Vale, I'm LOVING the current situation. Goons have a similar hatred for NCPL after being hell camped into a single station in the Casino war. Test and Goons have been enemies in the past, but we share a common loathing of NCPL! My enemies enemy is my friend!
---
&gt;Oh, and those people actually were people and not bots. 
---
Haha
---
They haven't, its just The Narrative.
---
Watch The Meta Show or read Imperium News Network - there's literally acres of goon make-believe to enjoy.
---
Not a single point you posted is accurate.
---
Sorry dude.
---
Yeah, there isn't a monopoly. There's just a hell of a lot more titan sin the south than the north.
---
Mind you, let's not give too many props to Test - they've built their titan fleet by frantically blueing everyone they come across. It's less of a challenge to build big ships when the nearest enemy frigate is on the far side of the map.
---
Hi, Rote Kapelle here.
---
You're wrong, but that's the danger of blanket statements isn't it?
---
I thought INIT had sucked it all up
---
so just focusing on pvp and letting krabs give money to them is worse,
---
than getting new players into the game by making them pve for a year, getting them hooked on this in game culture that makes them basically see EvE pve as most of the game, inject 10 alts to suck more spod, until they can be one of the titan linemember #5thousand
---
like, how does anyone enjoy this type of gameplay?
---
Good times
---
Just just some additional stats regarding the income. I run 15 rorqs which are all skill injector farms, they are all skilled into cap production, reactions and also doing PI with them which nets me 50-75b/week depending on how much time I spend online.
---
but have you entered a wormhole that appears to be inhabited and it was so full of anoms that it feels like you re visiting someone's house and their garden is overrun with weeds and you can see rats and roaches moving about? 
---
disgusting, filthy slobs that don t deserve the home bob provided for them
---
I would 100% pack one ship leaving all other assets behind to go through another one way gate to a new map on a bunch of pilots.
---
I guess you missed the part where the 20% value of the loss payout could still be a thing while also revamping the bounty system and tying in kill-rights.
---
It shouldn't be safe from scammers, it's fucking EvE. Vetting the hunter should be necessary and allows bounty hunters/hunter corps to build a reputation as being legitimate/trustworthy.
---
Cough, Cough. Horde anyone?
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/2053796889/ bullshit.
---
EVE is real
---
I don't disagree with you personally, but just maybe CCP should think about putting some fucking toys or something in this huge sandbox of theirs. 
---
I mean, in lieu of just burying all the cat turds to make the sandbox look relatively free from aids. The new wardecc system is a good change, but what the fuck does it actually *add* to the game? It certainly doesn't make it more fun.
---
2 years ago, even
---
Sorry to be the one letting you know, but they aren’t releasing RP-PVP :/
---
Nc half ass defended that, Horde and PL never showed, we didnt go after SOV, GOTG was already broken down from ROIR deployment, and we were able to keep everything timed to a single day in the end (the 4 keepstars).
---
Telling new players to fuck off and dropping a titan on them is worse than welcoming them. Yes.
---
&gt; So maybe you aren't aware how sov works in Eve. When one group lives in a system, and another group tries to move into that system, that's called an eviction attempt.
---
You're dumb we moved into Co2's space bud.  Quite literally M-0.  Progod and me are talking on skype and he's like are you guys staying, im like yes, he's like ok fuck that we're leaving.
---
You can make as much other dumb shit up as you want but it was literally right then and there decided.
---
The change came a couple years ago, and there are plenty of people that roam around looking to kill rorquals, but the rorqual has fantastic defensive abilities that make it hard to kill without the use of a large fleet or the use of capital ships, both of which are discouraged by local super fleets ready to jump in on anything that pops up
---
Thanks for that. I totally forgot about Shoot First and Siege Green, I'm a little fucked up right now though. Wasn't aware Fweddit was still around either. Just had a minor brainwave and would like to mention Rote Kapelle as well. I don't know what they're up to now, but a few months ago they were having a blast, and are a really cool group of guys.
---
Iron has sov, but I included them because I have a lot of respect for you guys and your playstyle/goals. You have sov, but you try to avoid politics and, as pointed out, spend a lot of time outside of Fountain doing small scale content.
---
&gt;Who said anything about PL's decisions making sense?
---
Everybody?  Or are you going to try and pretend that we didn't constantly position ourselves perfectly for nearly a decade as the meta changed in EVE? We were literally known for making some of the BEST decisions in the games history.
---
I love all the Brave and TEST guys who try and rewrite history after the fact.
---
You think a simple red vs blue, only two sides is better than 1000 choices in alliances to join? 
---
Fleets where when you do something, you see and feel your actions affecting the outcome?
---
You would really prefer to just be that 1/1000 that gets blasted off the battle space and no one notices or cares?
---
I say this every thread.
---
Rorquals are fine, excavator drones are the issue.
---
Call me dumb all you want. It doesn't change the fact that you're trying to make up shit about what actually happened in Fade. You evicted Brave seemingly on a whim and now you're crying that they and their allies are shooting you and your allies.
---
I used to think the mittani tried to spin facts too hard, but you're next level, bud.
---
If youre interested i can hook you up with our CEO if you want, do you have discord?
---
Yeah I remember there were fitt stable and really interesting in term of defences.

I would have thought you were trolling because I am rather vocal about how I hate the, "I want it now mummy! I wants it!" crowd but you have done far too much typing and must actually desire want to throw money at all of your problems and never surmount them, endure and get some maturity.

&gt; In the old NC - Razor was considered the PvP alliance of the coalition, while MM was the leading one.
---
MM and TCF brought numbers and caps, RZR brought being good at eve online (compared to MM and TCF), INIT brought being shitlords in venal instead of doing anything useful, IRON/OWN/M-E brought feeding
---
Do jot know?
---
Calling someone out for grammar rules than misspelling a word in the same sentence, hmmm.
---
Thanks for your vote, i got my shit together. I will be doing my best to represent the entire community. The false narrative that I love RMT and Missions and krabbing is all an accusation. My personal proposals show that.
---
That's funny because I am in Horde and yet I remember being there for many of the significant fights that happened and numerous of the insignificant ones as well. I also distinctly remember that DO6 fell after Goons took the I-hub in AUTZ. PL was around for some things after the X47 armor timer. If all it takes to breakdown GOTG is a deployment of a few Goon sigs how exactly were they going to be the mighty force that was going to grind your whole invasion to a halt this time?
---
Small ships are more fun because they can actually move. So maybe supercapitals should require commodities which can only be mined in a Venture or expedition frigate because nothing else is small enough to fit into how you get there.
---
Of his 4k kills, 2,829 are capsules.  
---
I mean...not sure how elite that is.
---
In my own defense, upon entry I will be thinking of a women when I de flower thebigredboat at the Mitanni mixer at eve Vegas.
---
Prospect can signature &amp; speed tank sleepers in some sites. I don't remember which exactly, but I did manage to do it a couple of times in C320/C540 ones. A T2 fit with an afterburner and a shield booster is required + at least decent skills. No implants needed. 
---
It's not very reliable, though. The problem is that you can't change the orbital path around the gas cloud, so whatever you do your ship will always orbit it the same way. That makes it random and thus dangerous. Sometimes the game will you give you the perfect orbital path, other times it will suck and you will have like close to 0 transversal velocity, which means death. It's quite fun, though.
---
Retarded PL shitposting strikes again.
---
&gt; because of the elitism and arrogance
---
two kinds of people play eve online tbh
---
i first entered null in 2006. my first null corp was shiva, then a part of vertigo coalition living in fountain. bob came and steamrolled the region as part of the max campaign, and i left before shiva found a new home
---
since then i've carried a sense of resentment for shiva and morsus mihi for "giving up" so easily on fountain, although i realize the max campaign was pretty much an unstoppable force at the time
---
i went back to lowsec and got on my grind. a friend of mine told me that reikoku were so elite, *every single member* could fly a battleship, so i started training so that i could be that good one day
---
he ended up in rkk during the second great war shortly after and quit after that ended. gave me his t00nies and told me to sell them so he could never come back.
---
the next null alliance i joined was triumvirate in 2009, and we memed IRON out of existence. it felt like vindication - like i'd spent my time in the hyperbolic time chamber, and i'd come out of it a decent pvper, a respectable eve online player who'd proved his salt and was worth consideration for corps with elitist attitudes
---
two kinds of players, man
---
&gt; You evicted Brave seemingly on a whim and now you're crying that they and their allies are shooting you and your allies.
---
Didn't happen, and nobody is shooting me or my allies because I dont have any allies and haven't been in PL for nearly a year, however I'm still not going to let you arbitrarily change a part of history to suit some bitchmade story you're peddling about what happened.
---
Yea bud, this war is the only thing PL has ever done, obviously you're right.
---
Never mind the 14 years that came before this one right?
---
its a good analysis!
---
To fully assess the state wether if OP or not you have to consider how it performs in the pvp enviroment aka sandbox though.
---
If you are rorq mining you are in a big bloc. If you are not rorq mining under a fully assembled umbrella (Imperium/Legacy/Frat according to their TZs) you are an idiot. if u loose your rorq under an umbrella you are a retard.
---
This means by default you shouldnt loose your rorq.
---
The mining itself is mostly low apm and the anom/moon mechanics give you infinite access to more mining. Ergo rorq mining can be scaled almost infinitely. (You shouldnt die in a carrier/super either but atleast this cant be scaled in the same manner).
---
So does the amount of time or ISK to get another rorq matter? no it doesnt. Does its gameplay scaleability matter? most definitely. Does its safety in the umbrella meta matter? most definitely.
---
From a hunters perspective inside the sandbox (pvp/pve/etc) I wouldnt care if rorqs mine as much as when the active rorq mining was introduced or even more however make them a pvp content driver. with the umbrellas and the rorq safety mechanics like PANIC sadly they are not. btw 200 stukas/kikis to go for one and hope the umbrella wont drop in time or dancing around the grid in retarded boosh comps is not what this game needs...
---
Yeah. And if you look at the price of a titan vs the price of a dread it should be the way that you have to outnumber the other side significantly to win. What I'm missing is more that there is little for general support roles to do. Sure you can neut a bit and maybe tracking disrupt but in general your tactical options are rather limited in such a fight compared to a sub cap fight.
---
I a subcap fight of 200 high SP &amp; high isk chars against 500 low SP low isk chars you would probably put a 100 guys into cheap ewar ships. You would have a bomber wing and so on and so forth. Like I said you can do a bit with caps but not as much.
---
Regarding the simulator: Judging from the EHP on the screenshot your avatar doesn't have any implants plugged in. You'd have to put implants into the char in pyfa and then export the fit afterwards. The same for command burst and phenomena generators which you can assume to be present. The similator is also not able to turn the EHE on. If you export a fit with EHE on or off it stays that way all the fight although the EHE can't be on all the time in reality of course.
---
Other stuff that matter can't be captured by such a simulator for example bumps. In general there is simply a good bit more going on in such a fight.
---
This doesn't make the similator useless at all. You can see some rough scaling numbers and so on. But take it with a grain of salt. (inb4 you write some blog post where you demand nerf this, buff that.)

This is what passes for a joke these days.

played it with ToT (Tourists of Terror) , beats me what year that was tho
---
Lose.  The word is lose.
---
I wish we could get this more upvotes, everyone needs to see this.
---
Sounds like a lot of work.
---
Because no matter how much sand is in the sandbox, there will be an optimal way to play.
---
You can either play that way, or get fucked by those who do. Which is exactly what is going on right now.
---
just need one guy in fleet to get the warp-in and have fun with a few smartbombing mallers or whatever
---
well when you have 30,000 online accounts split between 2,500 users the entry level of fun becomes a few years in.
---
What do you do? 
---
Would you like to link your main characters zkill?
---
Whichever one would be the easiest to do
---
Sounds like a handout to scammers and unusable by everyone else, imo.
---
&gt;Crushed any resistance (outside of goons) with superior titan numbers  
---
&gt;Dominated any smaller new alliances that formed

Are you saying TEST is the new PL?
---
Why would you flaunt being in Rote Kapelle as some sort of authority. 
---
Lmao imagine being in rote kapelle.
---
&gt;NC./PL are no better than Simple Farmers, risk adverse crybabies that just care about their zkillboards
---
Rude!
---
&gt;Oh but Vily started calling it that, I guess part of the terms.
---
TAPI are goon pets now, so it makes sense
---
When small number of people are involved, it's relatively easy to organize that via simple third party. Don't know about these days, there used to be a lot of trustworthy people doing similar things a few years ago.
---
Meaning, putting formal system for personal contracts in place to be will change very little in terms of what you can actually do in this game.
---
Blink twice if there’s a goon in your house holding you at gunpoint bro
---
Hahahahahahahahajahaha you got it backwards: 
---
There is nothing to do in PandaFam,  but there are 99% of any Eve activities available to do in TEST/ Imperium.
---
 You are just butthurt cause your elitist way of dropping supers on people who cannot defend themselves is gone. Try another UALX you entitled whiny fucks!

Good post OP!

Ok

You Chinese? No?

So basically, you a non-Chinese telling Chinese about how they are not allow to make fun of other Chinese

are you implying somehow you are superior so you get to dictate how Chinese call each other is acceptable or not?

Woah that's fucking racist dude

You're a cube-brain if you think NCPL vs CO2/Test in 2016 was anything other than seal clubbing. Same with NCPL vs Brave not much later.

Don't forget that morale damage from not doing anything interesting is probably the most dangerous damage your organization can take in this game if it's big enough.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fittings/comments/byymm1/new_to_wh_fittings_please_help/eqx0rii?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)a link to a comment I wrote a while ago on r/fittings about C3 Ratting. While this is not exactly what you asked for, the fits shown there are definitly able to do the Gas Sites as well. (It is way too much tbh, but when starting out to be a bit overkill isn't a bad idea). 
---
In general, you will be able to drop a lot of tank shown in the fitts, as described in the guide I added to it.

More of what you asked for, but requires a bit better piloting (little less ISK on the line though), pretty easy to fly, things you have to be careful about with the ONI is described in the comment.

Interesting way to build your cover story ... take an upvote!

It used to be funny for us wormholers, when this drama didn't impact us, but even our groups are struggling with stagnation.

You keep rolling and rolling wormholes and apart from the mega blobs with super umbrellas there isn't much to shoot at anymore. And it is not just the summer this time.

CCP have so much shit to fix in such short time, while having a huge hemorrhage of active players.

Mine was a typo as well :)  Woah! Another edit! Good job!

so the 13000 legacy and imperium renters didn't prompt you to ask the same question?
---
I think this is my favorite comment so far
---
As a person who refuses to sleep close to a mobile phone, I feel for the erebus crews.
---
NCPL is just as bad as Test to small alliances, if not an order of magnitude worse. Every bloc is the same - they squish the little guy out of the game and rent out their sov. NCPL rented out several hundred systems while Test and Goons rent out at most a quarter of that each. But they're all bad, and if you're in a different bloc than those, don't pretend your group somehow treats them better either.
---
There's so much more wrong with this post but I imagine going through the effort to list it out would fall on deaf ears. Un-cube your brain. NCPL absolutely did this to themselves.
---
Making clear that I'm not commenting on Eve's lore surrounding shields:
---
[It's a purely cinematic trope.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields) Nobody's articulated any concept for how such a thing might work in practice (though I'll bet if you dig deep enough in certain fictional worlds' fan bases, you'll find people who try.)
---
A Marshal is much safer than a Mach.
---
Marshals can exit cyno whenever they are under any threat, whereas a Mach is laughably easy to catch.
---
But, the moa...

I see at least five paying customers in this image. They log in daily and even undock. That's all that counts, right?

I've heard a lot about how serenity died due to it being a blue donut, but is anyone able to tell me what the status of low sec and wormholes are in serenity? I'm assuming less blue donut stuff but then again I didn't expect TQ to ever be this blue so y'know
---
I'm well aware lol, and I never claimed our discussion was on Eve's lore.
---
This is the good little guy alliance shit I LOVE seeing! Very glad to see that you're still at it.
---
I actually worked with you guys briefly for about 5 minutes about half a year ago in Pure Blind/Fade. Had a good time and would definitely do so again if we end up in the same neighborhood.
---
I just had a look at the monthly economic report. Destroyed value is at a highest in 3 years. I can't see how the game could be dying more now than 3 years ago. 
---
I'm afraid many players suffers from a perception bias on this matter.
---
Time for a delayed local, dare I say.
---
Christ. How much does it cost in rl ISK to Plex all of these, or did you only Plex at the start and use the isk generated to pay for itself afterwards.
---
&gt;Rorquals are OP, I mean, Just Fine
---
#r/Eve didn't like that

I know this is an ironic comment and I know it's for legitimate reasons, but man it's painfully disheartening to see this as the mentality.

Oh OP, bless you, you are trying to use logic with proof on the unwashed masses of reddit.

Better way to get karma is to go:  *but behold if we use the :grrgoon: factor in my calculations we can clearly see that goons are the root of all evil and the reason eve will die.*

So I recently got into my first carrier and started clearing havens/sanctums to get 10/10 escalations.  At least that was the plan, I have done 78 havens/sanctums and have received 1 10/10 escalation. I asked my corp mates if this is the norm for the escalation rate, and got varying answers, so I turn to you reddit.  Did CCP nerf the spawn rates recently or something?  Or do I just have tremendously bad luck?
---
At least don't post same killmail totals *multiple times*
---
The worst part of this entire "war" is all the shitposting goons are doing. Don't get me wrong, I love good propaganda. Even if it's from my "enemies". But what we're seeing is the most circlejerky low effort shit I've seen in a long time. It's bad, even by this subreddit's standards. Are you guys really *that* bored?
---
I cant take credit for the perspective. I just took screenshot of the ship on my laptop and traced the details  over some paper and then traced that on the canvas with a backlight.
---
Join a WH corp, best space in the game.
---
Seems like your valued allies in GOTG are running bots 24/7
---
You seem upset.
---
Goons have been an EVE superpower for over a decade.
---
Also how do you not like getting double grid-wide-doomsday'd through a cyno from titans rubbing up against the edge of a POS shield?
---
Time for #JustFuckingDo*Something*2019
---
anyone in legacy is effectively in a blob alliance dipshit, just cus you're in a different alliance \*technically\* doesn't make it functionally any different.
---
GOTG are goon renters
---
Iron are less mercs these days. Contracts are a pain in the ass, and we already fight outnumbered/outgunned, why do it for someone else for not enough isk?
---
we are deploying bandits and marauders, with a solid 'home base' to springboard out of.
---
come check us out =)
---
I'm not upset. Just disappointed
---
that too but fact is, NC. butthurt weaklings getting raped hard in null
---
cus they're not disbanded???
---
plus skill urself wasn't really as much as part of Panfam as NC and PL (obviously)... tbh it was a bit of a stretch to call them panfam at all, so even if renters somehow got involved in wars like RMT and BOT, PIBC definitely  wouldn't have joined lol
---
9000 IQ mate
---
Hands down best logo in game
---
The game actually in way too much in favor of big alliances it's quite strange if you can't realize that.
---
Yes rorquals bring down the price of a lot of stuff by it also accelerate the super/titans proliferation and decrease the value and interest of other areas where making isk was different.
---
Like there is no [insert big alliance here] brigading on the eve subreddit X) 
---
But every post containing, "I know I will be downvoted for Xx reason" make me laugh, people seem to like to appear as poor victim on reddit despite often being part of groups that do most the brigading
---
That too, but after skills are maxed the training can be used to extract SP for ISK.
---
This is a totally myopic way of reading the data. Destruction over time should eclipse made goods to give incentive for industrial players to recreate so the circle keeps going( in wild theory) 
---
Here is though the important question; what metric isn't the monthly economic report showing? 
---
That's right...stockpiles. 
---
So saying that just because there is destruction, thus there is activity is reading a paragraph from a book and saying you understand the book.
---
This data set can be further elaborated as well with questions such as;
---
Unique player accounts contribution to x,y,z. 
---
Active stockpiled materials/finished goods 
---
Active unique player account destruction contribution %..
---
And so on...
---
Stop mixing the purpose of the monthly economic report to deduce causalities and explanations of variables that aren't in the same dataset. The only variable that might provide some granger causality of player base activity is money supply( and that would work on whale customers and would require a model)
---
There are two stakeholders who can tell us of activity
---
1) CCP itself
---
2) collection of large alliances who represent the majority of player concentration. 
---
The first won't do such a thing( which gives hints on its own) and the second doesn't have the tools to provide accurately such statistical data.
---
fully agree with this \^\^
---
True TEST wasn't evicted and moved out on its own. I remember peeps were mad we didn't stay and put up a fight. I dunno what NC/PL's plans were for Vale but I do remember PL staging on the northern border of WH-JCA to hunt our best krab systems and to entosis some ihubs for fights only to not show up cause we'd gather 500 dudes. I also remember to constant form ups to defend in P3EN-3 only to get dropped on by their super fleet. Co2 the strongest ally with no place to live, having to deal with PL's harassment to the west and their Russian enemies who were in a tug for sov to the east it made sense to leave.
---
ughhh titans do like almost 2x the gun damage of dreads. rag: [https://i.vgy.me/rfhuVR.png](https://i.vgy.me/rfhuVR.png) nag: [https://i.vgy.me/DqRO1M.png](https://i.vgy.me/DqRO1M.png)
---
judging by your writing skills i'm going to assume you don't read too well either BUT i will say that monthly economic report says what they want it to say; destroyed value of what exactly? minds? hearts? frieghters? rats?  
---
What is being destroyed and where?  
---
In order to understand data correctly you need more than just the numbers.
---
my fc told me tod ownvote this post u cant sya this stuff about my aliance
---
Oh a voice of reason. We could discuss the exact numbers of course but the ballpark numbers are right. One thing relatively important thing you don't seem to consider is, that you start to extract skills from your pilots once you hit a certain level. Also if you have the hardware and willingness to multibox 5 accounts you should not go from one rorqual to two and so on but start with one rorqual and four VNIs or barges. Then progress to more and more rorquals. Also consider that the rorqual yield was recently nerfed so most complaints about rorqual proliferation are pre nerf. We have to see how things settle down after the nerf.
---
People will still try to live in the corpse that is Eve
---
Rorquals are objectively terrible ISK/hr.
---
What makes them attractive is (1) scaleability, and (2) relative ease of defending them. Those also are ironically the two major problems with them too.
---
Simple solutions would be introducing resource scarcity in regions in the short term, as those will cut down how much minerals there are to abuse in an area under the umbrella, and in the long term look at making rorqual mining more engaging so it becomes less AFK-friendly and so doesn't scale as significantly.
---
so they have more tank can be rep'd while doing double the damage can move, have a burst damage module. an buff's even more reason not to use dreads rather then titan's
---
rollback fozziesov to when people actually had to come out to repair it if it was trolled.  
---
THAT would actually help a lot and was the original plan i believe; there are few alliances out there that want to spend every day of every week repairing sov systems they dont use and that are too far away.
---
&gt;Jokes about dinobrains making retarded posts trying to justify the terrible state of the game
---
Dinobrain proceeds to make a retarded post trying to justify the state of the game.
---
in theory yes, however dreads don't do nearly enough DPS to make dropping them on a formed super fleet worth it. If you were to say drop on a group of 50 titans and 50 supers with 100 dreads you might kill a titan, maybe two if you are lucky/they are shit. But you will be losing dreads so fast to supercarrier fighters and titan guns that getting anymore kills will be hard.
---
I suggested to the CSM that dread DPS should be increased to ~16k for T1 guns and 20k/22k for T2 and CONCORD guns but I don't think it went anywhere with CCP. Increasing dread DPS would probably shift the meta too as you wouldn't need to fit as many damage mods; if you could do 16k DPS with a T1 gun Revelation with 2 heat sinks then that could open up some interesting triple plate/DCUII fits (some of which we have seen some groups test out) emphasis on more tanky dreads that do more damage is something i'd like CCP to look at. As current any number of dreads you drop on a group of formed titans you need to take the number of titans and half it just to get the number of dreads you will instantly feed to double DDs.
---
You dropped supers on my solo ratting myrmidon 5 years ago, I've waited 5 years to make this thread. Now NC. and PL will face the full humiliation I felt when I got laughed at for having a small hull repairer and a shield recharger on my battlecruiser. 
---

You do have a point haha.
---
That's a lot of words to convince whoever will read that EVE is dying. The fact doesn't look so clear to me and I told why. Of course you're free to waste your time trying to prove that EVE is actually dying, or you could simple play the game that still lives.
---
yes and no, the fax nerf fucked over smaller groups of titans dicking around but vs a formed super fleet it didn't do much, sure you might kill something for 100 dreads lost but the fight won't last long because of the DPS titans and super do
---
Checked in my cryatal ball. Very accurate drawing.
---
right, so the only thing stopping HRE renters from dropping hordes of titans is the fact that HRE disbanded. gotcha.
---
It always puzzled me, why people use delta, when this number basically makes no sense whatsoever?
---
I mean, a system with steady 1000/hour will have a bunch of active people and +-0 on delta, while a system one of them jumped to, farmed escalation, and already left, would go from 0 to 300 and be +300 on delta with literally nothing going on there.
---
Is there something I don't understand here, or people who use delta are just like other ganktards - irredeemably stupid?
---
Are you implying Rote is in Legacy? Or are you missing that your blanket statement of "the only people that dont think the game is in a bad spot atm are fucking nullbears in blob alliances who're content ratting, mining, or "PvPing" in 1000 man fleets" is hyperbole and on the whole: incorrect.
---
We've had and continue to have great fun even in the current environment, and we don't run in 1000-man fleets, rat or mine.
---
I'm not sure what you're on about but I would not be surprised if you're confused. :)
---
Let's see them.  There is no rule against sharing CCP communications - that's been changed.  Not that I don't believe Wallymarts, but I don't believe Wallymarts.  Maybe something was said, but I suspect he's making it bigger than it really is, or someone spammed something inappropriate in chat.  Wouldn't be the first time someone stirred up the pitchforks here and it turned out to be wrong.
---
And yet I never said anything about eve dying myself.
---
Untill you notice that this is not a live chat, but chat bot.
---
He's right though.
---
I'll play Eve till it dies, but what he said is true...
---
Used to scout chains 5 years ago and be guaranteed to roll into another group.
---
Scout a chain 20 deep now and find no one...
---
yep, you could do that by mail and then sending isks - if you do a contract, then they can abuse the contract, so it'll have to be on a trust basis anyway... and the 3rd party would be the best option either way
---
The only person they managed to get out of Bat before bat left was a very bad spy who traded friendships for some temporary favour with Sion. Oh and that Russian guy who paid our tax.
---
Yeah rorqs are fine or rather were. Because after this time elapsed how long do you need for your 6th 7th 20th? The bitch in all this is that the time has passed and now there's nothing you can do to controll the iskflow people with 20+ rorqs generate anymore. When inectors were introduced or rather before that someone at CCP shouldve realised that it creats a feedbackloop that will get out of control. 
---
I will say I started the game AFTER injectors were introduced and honestly without them I might not have stuck around because getting up to all the stuff you need in 0.0 or a WH just takes a long time. So for new players the injectors were completely fine and in fact a good thing. Just for EVE as a whole they were and are not.
---
The question noone has an awnser too right now is how to end this feedbackloop and stop it from spiraling even further out of control.
---
TL;DR Rorqs are fine the Injectors are the problem that might have gone too far to be stopped at this point.
---
People bitch about rorqs because of how hard they are to dunk/inconvenience under a umbrella not because of howmuch $$ they make
---
I made a few bil with incursions.
---
Recruited myself for 30 days free omega and some free sp &gt; coveter = money after a few days. 
---
Coveters turned into hulks and then into Rorquals  at some point, so yeah I never payed a single RL isk for all those accounts.
---
Actually no. 3-5h/day
---
I still think a chat bot could do better than ccp at this point.
---
Rote Kapelle is Recruiting
---
It was all cool and elite when PL was doing it.
---
If the folks don't leverage null sec to its full extent, then why not stay in low sec?
---
I feel like the "renter" mentality of the old is what led to this massive shift in power balance. Renters won't work together to build infrastructure, meanwhile those that want to mass produce Titans and Supers in the south continue to work together.
---
People are bashing on CCP for allegedly creating the conditions for this, and forget this is what HUMAN BEINGS (of which, some, play EVE) have been doing in and out of games since the beginning of time.
---
EVE is ultimately a game of power. Of conquest. Of control. 
---
For some that is more ISK than your opponent. For some it's more territory. For some it's more Titans. For some it's more salt produced, but in the end, the drive behind it is to be "*better than anyone else*" and the fact the big guys (be it Imperial-Legacy, NCPL, BoB, PIBC on Serenity, whatever...) will be driven to stomp everyone else down isn't CCP's fault: it's just what humans do.
---
Sure, CCP hasn't helped itself and the game, and that's a debate I'm always willing to entertain and what the real debate should be about, but going around bashing Alliances for playing a game of space domination, in a dominating and overpowering way it's just... silly.

Do you know where your biomass goes to?

1 billion lmao

Yep +1 for Iron Armada.

Don’t go to Snuff please for the love of god.
---
seems like it, hope it won't take too long to fix it\~
---
Why?
---
This is bait.
---
I have seen the soul of a sensitive being within this fine piece of art.
---
CCP made territory mean nothing in this game. Like a third of the active players feed off one region and a half and do jot need more space to krab, which is ridiculous.
---
Why protect the bot names? 
---
Ratting needs to change. They need to make it so that drones aren't viable ratting platforms. The easiest way to do that is to force drones to ignore redboxing from rats - you have to manually select every target. Since the ECM change this is now no longer a problem for ratting, and it doesn't impact the PVP scene at all.
---
And no, it won't solve botting, botting will adapt of course, but for the good of the whole economy, a slowdown on ISK inflation would be a very good thing.
---
AFK money generation is what kills this game, as much as AFK mineral generation.
---
Fuck PANDAFAM!

This guy gets it.

i strongly recall PL being hated pretty badly for their blob drops back in 2014 ish if that's what you're talking about

Unfortunately, they aren't open for visits and even if they were, you'd have to ask them two weeks prior to your visit.

&gt; As of 2018/09/01 our studio in Reykjavík, Iceland will be closed to the public until we move to our new building in the Reykjavík Science City   
---
&gt; CCP are due to move to our new building in Winter 2019/2020, after which we will re-open for visits. 
---
&gt;**How long in advance should I request a tour?**  
---
&gt;You should contact officetours@ccpgames.com a minimum of two weeks before your preferred date for a tour.
---
Sounds way better than eve right now tbh
---
Bummer. Thanks for the info! :)
---
Killboards are source of intel on what people are flying, which makes people undock and try to counter.
---
No killboards = no intel = no undocking.
---
I mean, we all know roaming is dumb and boring, but that'll make it even worse.
---
I think the real problem with rorqs (ignoring they are harder to kill than some people would want - to be honest i would prefer them to be easier to kill, but cheaper so the loss would not be that great) is the actual amount mined. This naturally leads to a proliferation of supercapitals cause the same thing that supposed to make building them hard (logistics for the minerals) forces people to keep those minerals where they were mined and build stuff... and for that amount of minerals supers are the only way to go. 
---
I would think the guy that said that excavators are the problem is right. Lower yields, make the rorq overall cheaper but halve the panic time for example. You may or may not get to save your 2b ship (insurable) like a dread, but it is not that bad if you don't. And it does not mine a titan a week...
---
Without rorqs and everyone super ratting for example you would have a lot less titans and a lot more liquid isk so a titan would probably cost like 100-150b, but with most people in rorqs you have tones of titans and they sell for 45b now and probably will continue to drop as demand gets lower (everyone will have one soon :D) and people will still need to do something with tones and tones of minerals.
---
yea, massive cunts
---
Not getting caught and dying is the elite part to be fair.
---
I've not looked but couldn't it just be that several of them were identical fits and exploded on the same day?
---
Assuming they were all set for the same final timer window that's not terribly unlikely.
---
They dont try to rewrite history, they just like that you get your shit pushed in.
---
Sounds like they had a cert expire. Assuming there's an admin alive in there it should get fixed within a day or two.
---
That said SSL certs are something which can cause admins a lot of grief because they sometimes have obscure installation requirements and it is something they don't have to do very often.
---
Nobody ever said that null sec is the ultimate end to this game.  You all crying behind the keyboard are doing that. Forgetting wormholes, low sec, incursions, market trading....etc.   Hell even Red vs Blue and CODE are still hanging around somewhere.  If you wanna null sec pvp, there are some places that will drop on you more than others.  That's the risk you take.  
---
However I will state that injectors don't help the situation.  Never used them and I most likely never will.  I get the feeling that CCP wanted to bring in the credit card warrior/World of Warcraft crowd on that one since the big titan brawls got them some publicity.
---
Eh naw we're pretty certain it's in a bad place too, thanks.
---
Owner needs to renew his SSL certificate
---
i prefer tripwire to be honest
---
Wow 'let me examine your killboard' alive and well in 2019
---
**Making it seem as if the mined amount is the only balancing factor for rorqs is disingenous at best**
---
I think overall the idea behind the calculation is fine, but i think you are ignoring some rather important facts just to get the conclusion that you want:
---
* A 50% overhead seems generous to me, but let's run with it
---
* Someone investing in 10 multiboxed rorqs isn't mining just 3 hrs a day with them, you can be virtually afk while mining rorqs due to the limited inputs needed. So as long as you are close to your keyboard the rorqs will mine. 
---
* You fail to factor in passive sp accumulation over the timeframe of farming the isk for the injectors, with +5 implants this should roughly half your estimated time.
---
* Rorqs are not broken because they mine too much m³ in minerals, it's that they can do it virtually untouched &amp; afk, as long as they are mining under a supercap umbrella. Thus concentrating players into few regions, reducing conflict potential which in turn slowly drains the game of it's lifeblood. 
---
And on a minor note (i cbf  to actually prove this so i might be really wrong with this): In your discussion of the isk needed you fail to point out that until a year/year and a half ago plex prices weren't as ridiculously inflated as they are today, and many rorqal farms got jumpstarted back then, drastically reducing time to skill into a rorq using your method of calculation.
---
The three hundret KS is listed three times. Guess goons now achived multikillpoints in eve!
---
That misspelling avoided the embarassment of putting "wisdom" and "James 315" in the same sentence, phew. :')
---
We haven't been sitting on them to poach their FCs.  They don't effectively need our permission to undock anything with a jump drive.  We don't randomly turn on our blues on some flimsy excuse because they were stupid enough to put caps on field with us.
---
We're not nearly as cunty as PL was.
---
good lord i hope the first one isn't doc weed
---
also heartbreaking to see feedlord extraordinaire and mysteriously adept alt-tab-cynoer gaara's sniper relegated to 'that russian guy who paid our tax'
---
from what i remember, he subsidised at least two full BAT supers from the tax he paid while he was in (even if it was basically just 5%hopping). pretty dedicated dude; he had two PCs so he could run all his ratting (and then rorqual) alts
---
It´s too late.
---
I'm torn. I agree that a boasting smartbomber deserves to be killed, but I also welcome death to expensive pods.
---
the answer you seek was giving often and in-depth. it always comes down to yes injectors are a blessing for newer players and therefore shouldnt be deleted but "tweaked".
---
something like them working more as a accelerator or having a max cap for injected sp per toon at x mil sp or make certain skills like cap skills not injectable.
---
all of this will not happen as the spiraling feedback loop which you described is also an revenue loop for ccp.
---
yawn
---
Maybe if yall would undock and actually fight you would have a leg to stand on saying anything. Instead, you take to reddit and shit talk... maybe move back to high sec with all the other risk averse players?
---
I wrote up a guide on it here if you're interested :)
---
https://ashyin.space/how-2-krab-3-low-class-sites/
---
Exactly. But I'm getting downvoted by the swarm of Taperium Guardians of the PIBC members
---
*cries in virgin*
---
I think the risk averse players move to delve these days
---
TFW called risk averse by a goon
---
Ok, maybe go talk so more dudes in widot because at this point you are an embarrassment to even their low standards.
---
This is one of your better posts, joecuster.
---
this is much less effective than you think it is, since the noobships are likely kitey fit
---
what if you do the exact opposite? increase mining yield, make more ppl/alts login and mine in space. however rework their safety mechanics and the way the gameplay leads to dense umbrellas (ressource depletion + less anoms -&gt; less dense umbrellas) so ppl wanting to pvp have something to do except creating wednesday 11am timers which they cant attend.
---
Imagine being an NPC in a roleplaying alliance
---
The P3EN-E Keepstar was in Vale of the Silent, not in Tribute
---
Instant cyno inhibs would be a lot better change.
---
With decent preparation you could gank a not-very-bright super before they manage to organize a backup cyno, and even if the 2nd cyo goes up, you could still counterplay with drag bubbles.
---
"Test have been honorable to their allies since day one" am I reading this correctly?
---
I should actually keep that in mind for the next time.
---
Theres the problem, you were using a myrm 5 years ago, back then it was all about tengus. Fukin NERD.
---
I believe the was flaunting being in a non-failure of an organization which has fun PvPing and doesn't run 1000-man fleets. But what do I know. I was only reading his fucking sentence.
---
My god, is CODE still so dumb?
---
There are two reasons active players in hisec plummeted.
---
One is ganking getting buff after buff, until it became so much of a bother to deal with people either moved to other place or stopped logging in.
---
Two is Odyssey patch and follow-ups that pretty much completely impoverished hisec. 
---
I do not know which of two was more to blame.
---
 - Hyperdunking was an unintended buff to ganking which allowed ganktards to evade sec status penalties, so it was a buff, not a nerf.
---
 - Awoxing "nerf" spiked a dwindling hisec population. You should be happy about it, yet by the reason of being stupid af, you're not.
---
 - Orca "buff" came after a major nerf of scanability and drops from fleet hangar. Yet you do not see an incredibly major ganking buff and complain about a "nerf" instead like a dumbasses you usually are.
---
 - Skiffs suck so bad at actually mining that nobody but dumbasses like you would even consider using them. You can double that buff and Skiffs would still be irrelevant for anything but dumbass tears.
---
 - Bowhead is completely useless and therefore irrelevant.
---
 - Ganking insurance was irrelevant, as ganking at the time was just input broadcasting 30 catalysts of recruitment-rewarded 51-days accounts. All it did is removed smartbombing battleship ganks from being essentially free, and as we know, every ISK sink is a good thing.
---
 - Can flipping is still as retarded as it was, change was effectively nothing, so it's not a "nerf".
---
 - Mining barges used to be gankable in corvettes and completely unfit for a purpose of mining, which was done in battleships, so this rework was natural. Some of them are still gankable in corvettes with no option to tank up.
---
There is a massive drop in hisec playerbase, but as a former hisec player, I can assure you that NONE of the changes you mentioned are the reason for drop, and some are quite the opposite. I would actually like to return to hisec, once two major differences are made: rollback of impoverishing of hisec, and stop of a massive ganktarding buff spree, which was stupidly easy before and completely braindead easy now. And while the first is easy - rollback Odyssey and all industry patches that came after it, and you're done, the latter needs new measures - one of which is introducing variable CONCORD reaction time depending on number of offenses on grid, and getting at least SOME actual downsides of negative sec status, because current ones are a joke - one of the major problems of ganking is that there is literally zero risk involved, and if ganking fleets stopped infinite scaling of almost free ships, and have to put ships with some cost and implants on the line, it would become an actual profession instead of something a dog can do on a 10 days old alpha.
---
Well we are what we eat.
---
i mean, it had it's moments, but now... it's sad.
---
You are right there are awnsers but all of them have some downsides for the newbros too or wouldn't be all to effective in the case of cap skills not being injectable.
---
Honestly I could live with any and all of them it would at least be a start but it has to happen soon and as you said it probably will never happen instead.
---
someone needs to code the bot to answer said tickets, it just adds another layer of complexity to the system, and we all know how good ccp is at deciphering and creating code
---
capitals are no newbro ship. it may seem so today but thats not were eve comes from
---
Best to just quit eve.
---
"Test have been more honorable than PL to their allies since day one".
---
It's a low bar, but I think it's fair to say they passed it.
---
Sing Laison way high on mining for empire. Suspicious.
---
When did this term come into being?
---
Its just goons smugging over structure kills and ncpl whining its all do unfair after backstabbing potential allies...
---
Yep.  PL would drop caps on poor Brave flying t1 frigates back in 2014.
---
It's not fun to fight in and around them, also they are in every system so noone has to take gates to get save anymore. They also removed station games and have worse timer mechanics then pos.
---
They've also killed FW and made wormholes easier, all bad things.
---
Well there isn't much left that isn't a goon or a goon pet so you may as well rejoin the blob
---
Like what? That doesn't really fill in any gaps in my knowledge, and when I think of small or upstart PvP entities, I think BL, 401k, Pizza, RnK, Verge of Collapse, Darkness of Despair, Darkness (at the time), Pangu Coalition (also at the time, aka fraternity), Triumvirate, MoA, Dead Terrorists, Shadow Cartel, HUN Reloaded, Rote Kapelle, The Afterlife, Raiden, Evoke, Out of Sight, etc. None of those entities got 'bullied' by NCPL as far as I know, and some of them they even had a healthy rivalry with.
---
I'm not saying it didn't happen, I just don't know when and to whom, I never really played consistently though.
---
It's the umbrella that makes it work, and if it's a choice between not mining the umbrella and mining the belts, then the belts will get mined.
---
There's a lot of belts one jump from a staging in Delve.
---
The key to the new powers is they didnt have their supers logged off until the war came or someone was unfortunate enough to be dunked - they kept them around to defend the miners and ratters who would have been undefended renters under the old system.
---
Yup, I was picking up my Ikitursa in Jita the other day and I actually sent my alt scouting ahead to get back to the wormhole with it. I do not however fly with a scout when I roam 0,0 so there is something not right about high sec imo.
---
I'm not justifying it, it is what it is by a combination of shitty game mechanics and years of seal clubbing turned on their head.
---
Also it'd take you like 4 seconds to see that I'm independent and I'd be perfectly happy to see every last renter landlord and coalition bloc get deleted from the game.
---
You're probably right, but my goal there wouldn't be killboard efficiency, just to meme on the event.
---
Surely sort has to get elected to the csm with those hundreds of bot accounts voting for him not even he can fuck this up.
---
Sorry, my corp only accepts cultural marxists and feminists. We're usually found at the Perimeter gate in Jita protesting and gatting pepper sprayed by Concord.
---
you'd unlikely kill a single one
---
I think the easiest way to fix the massive scaling is introducing some dynamic, like a chance of Excavator running rouge, calling drone hive friends using a Concord Like reinforcement mechanic. Lets say there is a 0.01 chance per cycle that one of your expensive Drones is going going rogue, i think botting would be out of option, and even multi-boxing would be way harder to manage.   
---
In the back of my head i do have the brief memory ( \~2006 )  of CCP wanting to introducing some Drone based Gameplay not to different from what i explained
---
You're overestimating the average player who participates in this kind of thing. There's going to be at least 4 brawly blaster Ibises at 0.
---
I thought you hated my guts?
---
I mean I don't reciprocate that, no hard feelings on my end, but I thought it was how you felt.
---
You guys seem to be doing alright lately despite the state of today's Eve, which is good.
---
You can also extract SP and inject further into new rorq pilots
---
At the very least make it so that you only appear in local after you have broken your invul timer.
---
Career agents usually help you with getting an insight into the game's activities. They also give you a little bit of extra in equipment and ships on top.
---
I think rooksandkings have made a video over tat topic
---
&gt; CCP said 
---
If you remember HOW it happened, then it won't be a surprise that a few years later CSM discovered that it was a lie and retention was literally near-zero on kicked players.
---
First they asked public on presentation if they think it is a problem. HALF of the people present raised their hands. Those were not babies. Those were fans committed enough to attend a fanfest. Half of them thought it was a problem. You could literally not get a consensus that good on if botting is a problem at that time, so by amount of people saying it is a problem, that was probably a #1 problem.
---
...then CCP goes ahead and lies to them that it isn't.
---
Of course it was a problem, dumbasses, as confirmed by CSM, one of the two biggest problems.
---
Of course, being dumbasses, CODE ignores the refutal and still blabbers "but CCP once said it increases retention".
---
Rorqual tank and PANIC are not fine. But neither are excavators.
---
Reading this sub, I don't really want to be the poor soul at the other end of the live chat.
---
that die within 10 seconds to eachother
---
The redesigns looks way better now tbh. Asymmetry is a neat idea but so very bad when you actually have to look at it.
---
bad luck i think. havens escalate more than anything else in my experience, or at least you get a better rate of escalations per hour than sanctums due to clearing them faster
---
then again, i usually only get like one a day when i rat
---
hard agree, i didn't even know there were meta disintegrators until you pointed them out - no triglavian fit i've ever seen has used one
---
Is this the endgame ?
---
yes and yes.
---
Ah thank you I will have a look
---
Props to the Dude getting initial tackle. This whole campaign is bullshit in the first place.
---
It's about sending a message. 
---
I guess as an alternative you could get a Tornado with ungrouped guns and try to alpha as many as possible in one weapon cycle.
---
Dude when was the last time you were in a sandbox? A literal sandbox?
---
Because you get really fucking bored without any toys!! Sand only just goes so far!!
---
Calling it a sandbox doesn't mean it can't get stale. Eve isn't Minecraft.
---
underrated comment
---
you likely wont track any of them
---
Working in Customer Support, that is true in general, but not an all out answer to everything.
---
Older people for example have a hard time typing fast on a keyboard, and might prefer emails, as they can deal with them when they wish too.
---
The key resides in having multiple channels available for your customers to contact you.
---
However, last time I contacted support they replied to my email in less than 30 minutes, which is already top quality service :D
---
But but but we just added a new incursion and more ship skins. What more do you people want from us?!?!?!?!?
---
Pearl Abyss makes for an easy scapegoat but CCP has been shit long before they were acquired by them.
---
So that they can pretend they're good by crawling out of their little holes to gank at literally CODE-level stupid ease, while panic-rolling that hole at any chance of retribution coming their way?
---
And of course unanchoring Keepstars should they notice first signs of dreadbomb seeding.
---
No thanks.
---
No the thing stopping them is that they would never ever ever use them, hello? Engage brain please
---
Come now, who ever let a little thing like facts get in the way of a good narrative?
---
&gt; If you're bored in the sandbox maybe it's because you choose to play in a boring way....
---
I will never understand why this type of comment keeps getting so many upvotes. You got to have a very narrow conception of the game in order to genuinely believe this. Like don't you understand that the way the sandbox is shaped in a large part determines the way it is played??
---
There are definitely a lot of bots out there, but parts of Branch can be decent vs RR. But if you actually want players that fight back and may get backup, visit the Tenal parts. They tend to warp in backup and be pretty aggressive - just watch out for the cyno bait ones.
---

---
Idk why you're posting a shitty infographic instead of just making a text post like a human being.
---
But I actually agree. I used to play World of Warcraft and one thing that stuck to me was their customer service. Talking to their GMs via the ingame chat just always felt really natural. They usually walked the line between casual and professional and it worked pretty well I think.
---
I think it's much better than a ticket system where the support people are writing really formal, canned responses and take ages to respond.
---
"I-I'll fight you! But only if I outnumber you 4:1!"
---
Horde was at times carrying the defense
---
Chicken wire?
---
Its a check I make when I see retards posting something crazy on reddit. If youre gonna talk some nonsense lets see what you actually do ingame.
---
Ive asked this at least 10 times and not a single person has responded. Its a sanity check, I'm doing you a service and you dont even know it.
---
My what? Did you lugah as hard writing that as i did reading it?
---
&gt; non-failure of an organization
---
Are we still talking about rote kapelle?
---
lol
---
Nah what I mean is if you only restrict the cap skills you can still inject a good amount of skills for rorqs/caps as they are subcap skills or at least the subcap skills are requirements for the cap skills. Thats why I deemd it "not that effective".
---
Now that's bullshit. They're closer to destroyers than to frigates in signature and speed and you can definitely track destroyers that aren't afterburning at a good angle to you.
---
Not all of them will have perfect transversal either. Warp in at range, sort by angular and you'll definitely get kills.
---
I feel like fighting, quite a lot. Shame the foe don't.
---
Goonie btw.
---
roll new account, join dumpsterco, begin profit

Its meant to be a demo site for you to run your own, if you like it; the site has been “down” for days, while the fix was pushed to the repo for users hosting their own m(esi hostname change);

Makes a list of NCPL friends,
---
&gt; None of those entities got 'bullied' by NCPL as far as I know 
---
No shit.
---
My only issue is that the pve is boring Af. Put some effort into storytelling.
---
4 in a best case scenario, likely zero
---
You got PVPed 3 years ago and you're still so butthurt that you would rather see the game die than anything else? Wut?
---
Do you think Snuff constantly farming horde in oijanen was just as immoral? If you ask hordelings I'm sure they loved having Snuff around, it sharpened the beans and made them learn about this PVP game
---
It can be nice when used sparingly.
---
Like the rokh
---
Existential threat? NCPL has like 5k characters combined
---
Snuff isn't an existential threat to Horde. NCPL was.
---
Gotta keep motivation up for these timers somehow
---
terrible ISK/hr ? Compare it to orca + barges or carrier, there is no way that it's a terrible income.   
---
the income is still pretty good, sure nothing compared to a supercarrier...  
---
For your other points i'm ok with you.
---
Problem is, there's no real reason for actual conquest of territory anymore. So all the "wars" we see are either one-sided bashes or pre-arranged fights
---
Agreed. I started playing Eve 10 years ago, back with MM/Northern Coalition ran the show. Lived in Pure Blind till the whole Russian invasion happened, but I got to watch it unfold, wondering when MM/NC was going to come save everyone from White Noise.  How things have changed since then with both the game, and the experiences I've had since that time.
---
Your username checks out.
---
Your NM will be damage locked to em/therm so stay where the npcs aren’t naturally resistant. But as far as what one to use? Use both. Maybe some work for different missions better than the other.
---
Be the change you want to see.
---
Then realize how fucking horrible it is trying to be the aggressor in a war.
---
Yeah, they lost their space, were allowed to move and rebuild cause nobody could be arsed to actually kill them (sadly).
---
&gt; Mining barges back then didn't have anywhere near the cargo space they do now. 
---
Mining barges didn't even exist back then.
---
Could add two scripts to the siege mod, one increasing resists, the other increasing damage.
---
&gt; scamming the few people that are interested in this kind of game,
---
Which are usually the same type of people that dumps several hundred bucks every months into a shitty F2P mobile game ... stupid whales
---
OK that makes perfect sense and was not the best example.
---
No, not doc weed. Yeah, garaa paid for allot but when push came to shove, he chose the safety - the perception anyway - of Goons over any vague loyalty to bat.  Had he known with a short time bat would be participating in Goons Northern eviction, things may have worked out differently.  He didn't say much anyway.
---
Not sure how long you've been playing, but at the time, a lot of those groups either fought against NCPL or were considered rivals. Some of them were friends too, for sure, like Pangu Coalition. But back when I was playing, the PL-BL rivalry was pretty big, for example.
---
Hence why I'm asking for examples. Like I said, I'm not saying they didn't do that to others, I'm just genuinely curious, no need to be toxic.
---
He's right. Why is one acre feeding the whole county?
---
The problem is structure bashing and entosis are boring. It's a reason problem, it's just not fun.
---
Post updated with a shout out to you for highlighting.
---
If given the chance, players will optimize the fun right out of any game.
---
Please engage your brain and read the posts above, where OP clearly says that the reason he's not calling out the inclusion of legacy/imperium renters in the list is because they haven't fisbanded
---
Please stop posting.....  
---
its attitudes of shitposters like you that r/eve has become such a cesspool   
---
have some fun in what's left of the game mate!  
---
that's what we just did, and GFed in local as we left
---
amen brother
---
I would advocate for a longer panic button, but reworked so that it works more like an assault damage control that starts at 100% resists, but that over time, lowers exponentially. So during the first minute, it could lower from 100 to 98% resists, 98 to 95% during the second minute, 95 to 90 during the third, etc. The numbers could be tweaked to be higher or lower (you could argue that having 1-2 mins of complete invulnerablility could be good too), but the goal would be to make the Rorq virtually invulnerable to smaller gangs, but a ship that could die to an overwhelming force. Maybe adding a damage cap could be good. The goal is that a sufficient force could kill one before the current 4-5 mins panic, but smaller gangs still take more than 5 mins to kill it.
---
Did they disband?
---
Wait you actually undocked?
---
Saying 'F1 Monkeying is boring as fuck' isn't a particularly retarded statement though
---
The only reason I censored the names is so that this can't be labelled a witch hunt... even though we are all able to draw our own conclusions from both experience and statistics.

I spoke to a non-bot member of Ranger Regiment and he assured me that he would pass this on to leadership. If the bots are still in Ranger Regiment in 48 hours we know where they stand on botting...

It would be a good alternative to the current system, I think.

&gt;Please stop posting.....

&gt;its attitudes of shitposters like you that [r/eve](https://www.reddit.com/r/eve/) has become such a cesspool  
---
&gt;have some fun in what's left of the game mate!  
---
*Quoted for salt reasons and lols. Never not post.*
---
*TL DR;  whaa stop making fun of us, its fun when we spin a narrative but it not when you do.*
---
still is good work - you knew about all the tools to use to do the hard stuff and ended up with a lovely piece.
---
I would love it if there was a graphics mode that made the game look like this painting.
---
yes
---
the difference is, NCPL doesn't have a huge victim complex
---
&gt;infographic 
---
 infographic  makes easy understanding for readers. Not everyone reads the whole article. So i thought to present it in an infographic.
---
Uhhh... have you not been following the past year plus? That's exactly what they've been exhibiting against goons lol
---
We've currently moved into Providence-space as Hostile Neighbors, and we're not 'evicting' anything by doing so.
---
If a group kill a single Fortizar and 'Move in next door' and that causes an eviction. Then you need to toughen up and rethink your attitude to 'holding space' the key word being 'Hold'
---
eat shit you lost in a video game pathetic idiot
---
this but unironically
---
lmao you reap what you sow 😄
---
Mining is the lowest ISK/hr activity in the game, no matter what ship you use so comparing it to other mining activities is pointless. 2 ratting VNIs will outisk a single rorq for not a lot of investment or skillpoints. Incursions are arguably safer than rorq mining and you don't need that many skillpoints to run them. Heck, exploration is often a better ISK/hr than Rorq mining and that's the lowest isk investment activity in the game.
---
The real strength (and arguably OP thing) is that Rorq mining is scalable to as many accounts as your computer can handle since it is essentially an AFK activity. And that it provides all of the minerals needes for super/titan proliferation.
---
Farming delve has been so fun lately. You see goons post smug things on reddit but then lose a titan in their staging. Like they got farmed for more than they destroyed during that conflict. It's healthy for the game.
---
I don't care about the "truth" inside that image.
---
Was fun !
---
I’ve decided to unsub when my omega time end in September this year
---
Simple farmers are one of the best groups to happen to this game.

Small group of guys holding up entire alliances by being a pleasurable, twisting thorn in their side.

you sound like a pleasant human being

come fight us then

&gt;  Erebus everywhere is emitting fuck loads of EM energy. All the time.
---
why doesnt the Bus get a passive ECM? like any subcap in a 30km radius around it gets a bit of ecm on it (as strong as  a single EC 300)
---
Gosh. It’s almost like a goon sig moved into your space and fought your war for you for months or something.
---
But hey, who needs truth when you’re a strong independent coalition of literally one alliance plus a goon sig?
---
You earned it NC.
---
&gt; Triglavians are fucking nuts and they need to be stopped.

nah, its time we join em and abuse the black hole powers (trig bonus in shattered wh when)

yes, i agree. There are drawbacks in every service. But simple queries gets quickly answered on live chat. It's not worth to wait for 30 minutes for a simple query to answer. Right?

I'd love to see Null-sec activity stacked up against the entire-rest-of-eve activity as a percentage.

Or make it so that resources deplete eventually to force conflicts
---
Those who can't undock, downvote.
---
why would you ever want to engage in a war for any reason other than 'fun'?
---
you do realize a defender that wants to win is literally gonna evac all their important shit and make you waste time shooting dirt cheap structures, right?
---
the only people you can kill is the poor retards who don't understand the game
---
What are we listed as on this list?
---
yeah i always get you guys mixed up with REQ, my mistake
---
NCPL crying about getting dumpstered by superior Titan numbers. 
---
How time has changed. This is gold.

Amazed that goons took the fight, given it was only 2 to 1.
---
Not my circus, not my monkeys.
---
The player count is ccp's problem.
---
GF to all round, good to see the AU tz of NC will have a crack.
---
just quit . they won't give shit till money is coming.
---
only if people spent as much time forming small fleets and roaming null instead of posting on reddit
---
Indeed.
---
But there is also an economical reason behind emails, as it is not a 'live' channel, you need less staffing for the same amount of volume.
---
So that might also be taken into account :p
---
&gt; entosis is boring
---
Yes.

No.  You just have to have an amusing FC and think of it like a podcast... with guns.

CCP could go the GW way of pandering to the 8 year olds and jiat rescale, upsize and resell old memes covered in unicorn dust and rainbow hues
---
Are you sure you'd like it then?
---
But but ... Reddit said those 100 are elite!
---
While I'm sure there are bots operating in Branch/Tenal (just like in every nullsec region), this screenshot and your comments aren't proof of botting at all. I've previously run VNI's for income, and it was very easy to utilize scouts 1 jump away to get the VNI's to safety. I was accused many times of being a bot in local, for the simple fact of what you describe. A neutral would come into local, and my VNI's would already be safely tethered. This isn't a symptom of botting at all, just that I'm utilizing scouts and my brain (1%). I also think that your specific experience with RR doesn't give you the right to make a sweeping statement like "If the bots are still in Ranger Regiment in 48 hours we know where they stand on botting..." That isn't fair based on the thin evidence you provided.
---
so what you are saying is that if this where GTA physics, a rag would point its autocannons to the rear and yeet itself across the battlefield
---
Fuck off
---
maybe realize that the 'piss poor attitudes' are caused by what those people perceive as bad changes? maybe realize that 2/3s of the playerbase didn't quit over the last 7 years just because of 'crybabies' and attribute it to something the literal people who quit cite as their reason: dogshit game mechanic changes (mainly citadels, phoebe's shit implementation, and foozie sov)
---
Old scorp is burned into my head. I see haffa's every time I think of a widow.
---
This - I've roamed RR space in Tenal and died many times. You can grab a few quick kills sometimes, but they always respond. I've never not had them chase after me and/or try to bait with a scram/cyno. Always good fun whether you are solo or small gang to head into RR space in Tenal (the western section).
---
hes referring to [this](https://youtu.be/6i-nMWgBUp0)

EVE has thousands upon thousands of organizations throughout its history, I bet you can't name 99% of them.

Wouldn't work. Actual fight system is never announced. Don't actually know where the fight is until people start shooting \o/

I am mildly agitated that nobody is picking up what I am putting down.

“Nobody will ever want to live in wormholes” - CCP
---
&gt;  Like don't you understand that the way the sandbox is shaped in a large part determines the way it is played??

History says otherwise???

&gt;New player here,
---
First sentence of post " New player here, "
---
  
---
Yea..
---
and Thanks!
---
Thanks for making an example for my post.
---
You're bored because they are theoretically (that's a generous word) getting 5000 new players a day and the player base online keeps dropping.
---
I think they should balance some ships. That will fix it.
---
Not really. The victim complex is being the 2nd largest entity in the game with a pet coalition under them and still insisting on having a nip with the largest entity because they fear the day their 4 regions of buffer sov is taken by the boogie panda.
---
Ncpl has renters aswell as beta orbiting alliances and recognise their weakness but don't use it as an excuse to propogate the idea that they need to have 2/3 of nullsec friendly to survive. NCPLs relationship is a decade old at this point with guys who've been in both groups in leadership and content producing capacities, its not solely due to the survivability aspect but just due to being buddies aswell as sharing services and other stuff.
---
How do the people get there if nobody knows where the fight is?
---
Hey no, it's BOTG.
---
Let's be honest, both RS and EVE focus on the same audience of people who should spend less time on the computer
---
We all move from jita as a fleet and I'll bring them gate to gate until we get to the final fighting spot
---
Sorry, didn’t mean to take anything away from your victory today. Well done. GF.
---
From there it's a countdown and then the fight begins

*I understood that reference*

So you post retarded opinion, and when someone calls you out on being a retard, you just double down? Good one, keep going, dumbo

---
What a dumb fucking post. You've only proven that CCP didn't understand the game they have created, something which most of us are painfully aware of by now.
---
So what? Even if goons have to spread out at this point it's not going to make a difference. They could easily do so and have enough ships to set up a second umbrella in the new spot.
---
So any potential griefers could just follow the fleet. If the event is open for everyone they'd have someone in your fleet.
---
Oh, that’s you, haha we were shit talking each other in local around the ZH3 pocket the other day. 
---
:) I assumed you were with them, rather than hunting them. Whoops!
---
If you want an invite to my Loki ~~feeding~~ adventures in Tenal / Branch poke Neckbeard next time you’re up there.

Fleet comp checker and safe spots are a great thing
---
Thanks for making an example for my post. You are the problem. Please continue to play EVE though, just try to change your attitude.
---
People just vent their frustration, you think they will stop for a greater good of the thing which is cause of this frustration? Ha!
---
you didnt even respond to the second part of my comment lmao
---
apparently im the retard
---
Test's victimization was very, very real up until they pushed PL out of Tenerifis.
---
People seem to very quickly forget how close Test and Goons were to going to war in 2018 before PL came in, unable to resist going for another bout of seal clubbing, and gave them a reason to put that aside and team up.
---
Keeping the relationship until after the glassing of Tribute - something I imagine Test leadership knew was to be an eventually assured thing - makes sense. One can hope they break off relations after that, but more likely they don't, and at that point the hate against them is valid.
---
They do have some non-Chinese corps.
---
Are you actively discouraging players from playing EVE? Yes? Then don't? No? then it is in fact not your problem and your comment contributes NOTHING.
---
Those few goon sigs put pressure on GOTG for over half a year. At the intensity we were doing things anyone would break, look at The Spire for example: that entire region burned just from a couple sigs, Unspoken, and some wormholers led by a redneck.
---
How many years this point has been brought up already ?
---
just trying to fix ur delusion
---
No, I'm saying the number of players playing isn't a players problem.
---
You are assuming you know what said person does for fun, deciding that what they do isn't fun and determining they are indeed not having fun before you ever meet them. You are indeed doing a service by admitting your opinion means jack and shit before they ever enter into discourse with you and are un-ironically saving them time by not speaking with you. You need a narcissism check.
---
&gt;Piss poor EVE attitudes that want to do nothing but scream the game is dead/dying when it's not
---
Eve is Dying is a meme.
---
Thanks for making an example of your lack of understanding.
---
Listen i get it i'm still enjoying the game myself. But the problem here is that you haven't found your gameplay style to root yourself in. And i understand it being frustrating being unable to turn around without hearing someone cry that the game is dying/dead/buried. But you have to understand that they found their rooting and the ground was washed out from under them. 
---
What you are doing here is going to those who haven't completely died from being removed from their element and going "this is great what are you crying about?" of course you will be met with endless hostility.
---
I know that eve doesn't encourage it, but a little empathy can take you quite a ways out there.
---
grath, if you sat inDO6 and then reset brave and honor, then followed them into cloud ring when they tried to move there instead. tapi leaving was a strategic choice that they made (wanted to build a super fleet and not get farmed), but you hounded brave out and sat on honor until they disbanded.
---
fwiw, i don't think *you* did this stuff. but the apes who got the top jobs did, and aside from any 4d chess coalition bullshit (which is boring who cares), it made the north a pretty boring place to be.
---
Your talking extremes.
---
I never said don't illuminate and work with CCP to adress and correct issues.
---
I never said progress is bad.
---
I said that the atmosphere NEW PLAYERS come into when joining EVE, the atmosphere OF PLAYERS and not the atmosphere hosted and controlled by EVE, is extremely discouraging. If we all become more aware of how damaging we are AS PLAYERS, and stop pinning everything in existance on CCP, we can make some progress.
---
Repeat this post in three months
---

---
NCPL screw over a lot of new groups and little ones. Now they are little group, they cry yo CCP to make changes yo save them
---
No NCPL. Isnt EvE what is dying in Tribute. It's just you. ( ^_^)
---
Well not if CCP bans multiple accounts for botting that were brought into botting groups for the exact reason to awox bots. CCP statement on ban "misuse of alpha accounts" ....
---
It is not easy to cover a large area, even if you are Goons. Doesn't mean they would be more vulnerable, will be invaded more easily, but finite resources over a large area will result in more content, fights and human errors whilst defending.
---
Unless... you are CCP and hire complete regards who introduce a fucking network of jump gates with no fatigue and no limit, that will add even more cancer to the broken sov mechanics.
---
In this case, I agree it does not matter. It is unbelievable how much brain drain have CCP experienced in in the last 3-4 years. :(
---
Does this mean we r slowly become elite? Shit ... run for the hills.
---
Roaming north is dead pretty much. The Chinese took over Deklein too. That used to be great roaming space.
---
There's an avenue.
---
Supercaps are proliferating because they're simply too good. They scale better than any ship in the game because there's no counter to them, just more supers. This fuels an arms race that will never end, to the detriment of all other PVP in the game.
---
It doesn't matter if titans get more expensive or if the amount of minerals mined is decreased, the core problem is still the same. It's still going to be an arms race to build more and more titan alts. The side with the most titans will still win any engagement. It's **bad game design** plain and simple. The only thing that kept this awful design in check in the past was character training time, which is irrelevant now. Supers need a complete redesign to account for injectors.
---
The other big problem area is citadels, because that's another never ending arms race / mineral sink. Too easy to spam, too hard to destroy.
---
No, Netease is
---
Which second part? The blabbering about skillu not being aligned with panfam? How's that relevant to the fact that you are justifying inclusion of renters in the list on the side of legacy/imperium while at the same time reeeeing like a retard about renters being included on the other side?
---
Well, that too. But after you have trained up enough rorqual pilots, you can just sell the SP.
---
Yes, mawburn - i understand this. Do you understand why I am addressing this as an issue? Do you understand that we (the players) continue the meme and not CCP, and the meme is directly impacting the game in a negative way? We control the meme as the player base and it's not up to CCP to make it's player base more encouraging to new players.
---
Ehhhh Guardians of Imperial Legacy is pretty bad for the game too. They each screw over little/new groups too. It's important not to let either side off the hook. 
---
The implicit hope is that these groups will fully separate after the war, but the likely outcome is that they won't and that will definitely be a serious issue.
---
literally anything except new triglavian ships. a new tier of battleships would be neat
---
They don't? They are crying un Reddit asking CCP changes to save the... Save EvE, yeah. EvE.
---
They bullied every single small new Alliance they Cross. Now that they are the small fish, reddit tears time!
---
What's your setup regarding HAW/CAP ratio?
---
At the peak of the Rorqual craze, they were running around 10b ISK fully fitted, and in an average belt operating at about 120m ISK/hr (could peak out at 200m ISK/hr if you just cherrypicked but that is unrealistic). Factoring heavy water consumption, 110m ISK/hr is realistic.
---
At 110m ISK/hr, it would take approx. 91 hours of mining to break even the cost of the Rorq alone, before you could then make a profit.
---
Compared with:
---
VNI ratting (60m ISK/hr, break even in c.2.5 hours)
---
Carrier ratting (180m ISK/hr, break even in c.16 hours)
---
Super ratting (250m ISK/hr, break even in c.64 hours)
---
As you can see, it's not really on the same scale. The key point, scalability, is what lets the Rorqual shine as you can contemporaneously operate 5-6 boxes very easily with no noticeable loss in mining rate).
---
You still lose c.91 hours to mining before you have recouped the investment, but you have more boxes doing it at the same time, and therefore you achieve green on the P&amp;L sooner.
---
Also how is us having some fun and saying GF in local despite loosing salt and a narrative spin?????????  
---
Please tell me, or did you just copy/pasta what others say without context, reason or logic  
---
some of you bee dudes need to un-cringe and have some fun
---
Is it 2008 again?
---
Someone is either very bored because they can't undock.. or very salty. Maybe both. The upside is that a certain group has all of the free time in the world to brigade vote on reddit now. That's gotta be a plus.
---
How is asking CCP to make eve better complaining?
---
Fun fact, it seems CCP is faster with banning chars created to awox bots than with banning bots itself. So if you start Alphas and put them into botting groups, be prepared to have them banned with statement "alpha account abuse". The chars I know of could not even fly anything bottable for ISK neither have most of them undocked since char creation ... ya need to protect all those new "(plex) subbed &amp; logged in accounts" ...
---
You null boiz have got to wash your head of "Volta is an elite WH corp" just because they dunk on you nullies doesn't mean they have the slightest impact on WH space. I could name 20 corps that are far more influential in WH space.
---
The simple Solution is to make Rorq mining requirering sutch an active amount of micro management, that multiboxing them isn't a option anymore. 
---
Just look at carrier or super carried ratting. It may have a lot of other problems, but multiboxing half a dozend carriers isn't one of them since the micro management is to intense.
---
I've been playing since 2005, it's been a meme for at least that long. Eve is a niche game, it always has been and always will be. That meme hasn't hurt it nearly as much as you think it has. People don't play the game because it's not their cup of tea. I've brought dozens of people to the game since 2005 and it's always the same. Very few players, especially newbies, hang out on r/Eve or the forums.
---
You've come in at the end though. Because Eve is dying.
---
Also, Does this take into account mining while you're training for the rorqual?
---
Even a single procurer adds funds.
---
I will probably repeat this weekly. Whatever takes negativity out of the game works for me. On player's end and CCP's end.
---
This is really frustrating and I agree. Trying to catch content that has a reaction speed quicker than you can come out of a warp tunnel when entering a system is pretty much the worst. I'd love to see much harsher anti botting treatment. Any account that it transfers isk to and then one jump from that gets negged x 2 for the amount generated or some other arbitrary and heavy penalty.
---
nobody evicted test. pl might have been douches after wwb but stop making up this absolute bullshit. Co2 were evicted, but tapi chose (perhaps wisely) to move out when pl decided to stage permanently in M-OEE8.
---
vily and progod wanted to build up the tapi cap and super fleet and didn't think they'd be able to with a neutral pl so close. but they weren't evicted, and they weren't going to be evicted, so stop shovelling this shit.
---
thats why you don't drop them in a way that allows for bosons....
---
Only 8 comments in 11 hours it must be because people are bored of seeing the same thing over and over again. You forgot to add a disclaimer in the YouTube video description saying nothing special or unique here move along....
---
No. YOU are the problem with Eve. You don't have a basic grasp of this board. So yeah. Bye Felicia. You won't be missed.
---
Or, in the immortal words of all of CCP in their hit song HTFU, Harden The Fuck Up.
---
thanks for the advance notice, i'll just block you now and be done with it instead of having to see your shit
---
Explain this to me then... they happily rat/mine while my cloaky campers are in system. As a result I already know which anomaly to warp to for the kill... I also entered this particular system from an empty one next door.
---
Despite this overwhelming information and planning advantage I have by preparing/scouting they ALL instantly pull drones and warp off the moment I enter local on my main... from an empty system. They also usually beat my Loki to the fort grid if I head directly there and all land in rapid succession. 
---
I have sat cloaked on grid with my cloaky camper and literally watched them instantly react when I enter local.
---
Pretend and deflect all you like. These are bots plain and simple, the isk gotg is making off these taxes is tainted.
---
The latest new ships haven't even gone through significant nerf phase yet. 
---
Relax for a bit. Let's maybe work on some broken mechanics first champ.
---
So the only valid opinion is one that agrees with you? You are more of an example than that guy is.
---
with all due respect.  i think you may have missed my point.  i do agree shiny boats and capitals die all the time.  replacement of those shiny boats and capitals (on an individual level - not a corp/alliance level) requires isk.  how do you come by isk?
---
1.  In game activities (pve content).
---
2.  PVP proceeds.
---
3.  market and industry proceeds.
---
4.  plex proceeds.
---
am I missing anything?  
---
To close my point 1 through 3 take in game time and commitment to acquire ISK to replace shiny boats and capitals.  4 just takes a credit card and a few minutes to exchange PLEX for ISK.  It's about time, time is the enemy of this game.  The time it takes to gather resources to exchange for ISK to fund other ISK sink activities (PVP).  PLEX to ISK eliminates this time commitment.  That's all I'm saying.
---
I mean, as a member of TEST, I'm pretty similar.  My rorquals are mostly used to collect dust.
---
There's a larger reason.
---
&gt;heavy stealth bomber, something that could be used in a few numbers against caps, 
---
STOP WITH THIS DUMB MEME
---
more burst damage is not what the game needs, holy shit
---
&gt; Wants CCP to “fix” the sandbox
---
&gt; also thinks CCP is too dumb to fix the sandbox
---
Hmmmm
---
Well you’re right about one thing, there’s a walking pile of stupid here.
---
you weren't evicted by pl in vale, vily and progod decided to leave so they could build up a super fleet. but you weren't evicted, so stop talking ass.
---
&gt;  If you killed someone in null with one while you were in high you got concorded
---
reverse ganking: find a mine, find out if the owner is in HS, wait till he is in something expensive/ valuable (dst f.e.) and then yeet your venture into the mine
---
screw dis game! Who wants to play some classic wow instead?
---
Yes - EVE nullsec quality of life and survival expectancy increases drastically with friends, I'm sorry this game forces you to interact with others. All big alliances once started as small alliances, organizational Darwinism eventually brought us to the point we are now at, those who failed to adapt or evolve are no more.
---
&gt; ecrease the value and interest of other areas where making isk was different. 
---
What? Why is this important?
---
&gt; But every post containing, "I know I will be downvoted for Xx reason" make me laugh, people seem to like to appear as poor victim on reddit 
---
I didn't say "*I know I will be downvoted hablubluabla*", I said "*I see my comment was broadcasted to be vote brigaded by BB*" - these are two very different statements. The first is playing a victim card, the second is me making a comedic statement after observing logs / screenshots / additional obtained evidence confirming that this was, in fact, happening. It's pretty obvious I shitpost enough to not care about upward or downward arrows, I only care about calling out the bullshit.
---
I never said no one should complain. I never said the game was perfect. I said people are actively running off new players and then dogging CCP for it - even if both contribute in many other ways to a loss in player count.
---
You sound like a long time player who is butthurt by EVE and are ignoring your own impact as a player with influence.
---
Be an adult - you have power and influence. Use it positively.
---
I'm not trying to insult you or start a debate. I want to not wake up convinced this game is not worth my time, and it's not CCP doing that, its players. And if new players aren't coming or staying, do you really think that gives CCP and more or any new incentive to help the game? The player base runs off new players and then screams at CCP for starting to believe themselves that there time is up. Whether it is or not, the player base needs to stop convincing others of it.
---
Lmao really got me there good job bud. 
---
I'm not interested in your opinion if all you do is sit on reddit and talk shit and then join a 200 man fleet once a week. Hes literally telling people they are choosing to not have fun and "hurr muh sandbox". Why the fuck wouldn't I ask him what he does if hes gonna sit there and act like people are choosing to not have fun. 
---
The day I ask that question and the answer is totally legitimate then I have no qualms, but 99 percent of the time its just some blobby rorqual mining retard whos happy to mindlessly mine away and tells pvpers "the game is totally fine you're just playing it wrong".
---
But I guess thats just a little too nuanced for you.
---
Whats your point?
---
No its not, so lets check that that's not what he also does.
---
hint: its probably what he does
---
You get it :) keep on trucking.
---
GOTG was broken towards the end, you guys let them get bet up too much early on
---
Go and do it then. More power to this guy, I'm not here to say who's the best of the best or anything, just recommending who I know has some exciting stuff going on. If ya know some WH guys that are worth looking into, hype that shit.
---
And you're right, Volta isn't *really* a WH group. They operate out of Thera which is it's own thing, and spend a lot of time hitting null instead of WH space, probably a bit foolish of me to label them as such but it was the quick n dirty way to categorize them.
---
STFU, noob!
---
VNI is more like 80M/h if you use a salvage ship (4 anoms, use a destroyer to salvage the 4 MTUs you dropped, then use a hauler to fetch the MTUs and the loots). That is with a 90% BB, one account only, without taking into account escalations and commander spawns.
---
source : I did take note of all the loots, all the money, all the time required to do it, over 10 hours.
---
You make the worst fucking reddit comments. :\
---
Could argue that the witch hunt rule is for players and these guys obviously aren't players.
---
Not official mod stance btw
---
if you think pl and bl were friends back in the day then you should delete your reddit account and put your computer in the bin
---
Grammer. Zero explanation. Threw an insult and noped out. Thanks for adding an intellectual thought to the conversation, or at least defending your position is some way other than with insults.
---
Did I say you were the problem? Yea, because you are the problem.
---
what? we just got a shit ton of new ships what are you on about
---
I take it you haven't AFK rorqual mined before or you wouldn't be saying they are AFK ships. Something about the 1b drones getting sniped by rats that hit the belt every 20 to 40 minutes. Losing one of those erases 10 hours of mining.
---
It is not my fault, that shitposting on reddit quickly became much more fun than playing itself. ;)
---
Well, you could not quit the game after an eviction and fight back. That'd be cool. Surely you're smarter than the dinos and the bees and you can plot your revenge on them. Right?
---
That was absolute cancer, even for small groups with only a few systems.
---
When you're new you won't understand why people are getting fed up of the game. You'll join your Ferox F1 fleet and think it's cool, since you don't really understand what's happening. You just press F1 on a Citadel and your people say you did well. Heck chances are you're still in Highsec thinking missions and stuff are cool, or spinning a VNI thinking of how epic it will be to own a Super.
---
As a player that comes and goes in bursts, like most video games I play, I have not had an issue with low player turnout.  I like to spend my time ninja looting kills and there seems to always be plenty to do.  I am Sephylus and if you see me coming in my Trash Panda Velator I intend to loot and salvage your junk!   I am an easy killboard but for me low risk, high gain is the name of the game.  No one will pat you on the back for killing a corvette and you won't even get the salt because this alpaca sheds no tears.
---
"I see players trying to remove negativity from the game and encourage new players"
---
FUCK THAT GUY, BLOCKED! - Well played, ChocoScoots.
---
man if you unironically believe this you need to adjust your life view.
---
talk to a therapist, god bless
---
I think what he's getting at is that a blue donut led by panfam would be just as shit as a blue donut led by goons.
---
if tapi were on the other blob's side it would still be a boring fucking blob.
---
&gt;ship destroyed bomb fails to explode etc
---
Commiting honorable sudoku for the glory of the Empire? Well yes, of course!
---
&gt;And what would everyone like to see?
---
I already posted it numerous times, but i'd like to see a Cyno-Drag Ship which would be able to attract ships trying to hit the grid. Either one jump away or in the same system.
---
Those trees look angry
---
Why are new people such pussies?
---
ELEEET PEEE VEE PEE
---
Dude your unreasonably angry and are not presenting or supporting your argument well at all. Please stop making other EVE players angry that you are trying to represent them. Actually, please don't represent anything with that attitude. You are toxic.
---
I've played the game in a lot of ways and enjoyed them all differently. It's changed and not for the better.
---
I've only noticed it being seriously tossed around for at most 1 year here on the subreddit, but then again I spend more time undocked or IRL than on Reddit
---
I support this post while being a cog in the machine. That's why I voted Olmeca after approximately 28 minutes and 33 seconds of research.
---
The pilots can begin mining before they become perfect rorq pilots.
---
Instead of being vague can you actually list some names? Thanks.
---
So, what new alliance has TEST crushed?
---
Frat owns a stupid amount of sov now (252 systems today). They will struggle to hold on to it all consistently. I reckon you might get some good fights if you resist, and plenty of opportunities to hunt the locals.  It reminds me of No Vacancies who have held on to HHK in Fade for a long time with minimal presence. You're also really close to Venal and Branch for roams.
---
SoE Carrier/Fax when?
---
Stop taking yourself so seriously, because i can guarantee, you are the only one. 
---
There are about 7-8billion humans on this planet and EVERYONE is about as useless as you are, so stop acting like your shit in particular does not smell.
---
Hmm a tri capital ship maybe?
---
Damn those excavators that turn into a color. 
---
&gt;like a chance of Excavator running rouge
---
Imagine reading a joke about the predictable short sighted response always made by a certain segment of the player base and being so oblivious to the joke that replying with _literally the exact response the post was joking about_.
---
Actually, Dave - it is. It not ENTIRELY the players problem but to say the player base has no effect on the players   
---
playing it is rediculous.
---
Flapjack dread to go with our Flapjack battleship!
---
Wall of text says this was an honest statement:
---
&gt;Lmao really got me there good job bud.
---
Nice reply, I'm glad you had something intelligent to say when you realized you were totally dumb.
---
&gt;NCPL absolutely did this to themselves.
---
They did but this post is just a joke.  
---
Goons and TEST can reset so make the game more interesting. But same goes for NC. Resetting PL/Horde for instance.
---
You dropped supers on my solo ratting myrmidon 5 years ago, I've waited 5 years to make this thread. Now NC. and PL will face the full humiliation I felt when I got laughed at for having a small hull repairer and a shield recharger on my battlecruiser. FUCKING OWNED LMAO
---
Insults.
---
No positive input.
---
No thought out position, nothing convincing or persuasive.
---
You added nothing to this conversation and thread but negativity.
---
YOU ARE THE PROBLEM. Please refer to the post at the top of the page.
---
you really are pushing the limit on how retarded you are
---
I think more people bounce off the game's opaque nature than we as players could drive off ever. 
---
And yes you literally say multiple times not to complain because it might offend new players and make them leave.
---
Contrary to what you might see as someone who just got here i see something entirely different. People aren't trying to kill the game or angry because it changed. They are crying out in agony as something they loved and cherished is being broken. 
---
The screams you are hearing, and complaining about harshing your good time aren't anger. They are pain.
---
This is a perfect example of "Projection". You may be having some issues, you may or may not be conciously aware you have problems. But your projecting your issues on to me.
---
Why exactly? Why do you not have an argument other than "YoUr DelIUsIonAl"?
---
I mean.. you aren't calling the north out for being so butthurt over karma catching up with them that they won't login and fight. I mean, they must want EVE to die.
---
No one cares what you think.
---
If you’re having fun, that’s great for you.
---
We holded some sov 7 systems in the spire for 1.5 months in march  but we got killed by nc pl  and their people     we had the biggest fun of our life   holding our own sov   and we didnt sell our souls to big alliances or coalitions     but you are not allowed to own sov these days if you dont sell you soul
---
Provi, brave, test, co2, legacy, plenty of other alliances over the years. Some - multiple times.
---
That is completely different from how you represented in the OP. That does sound like a bot and not a human reacting to scout/intel.
---
Coming in Fall 2019 CCP is proud to announce EVE AUTOCHESS!
---
Hmmmm, This would be an example of negativity. You don't truly understand what you typed. I never in any what invalidated his opinion. I said it was negative, nothing else. Please do not assert MY OWN REASON for a response when you do not know. This looks very, very poorly on yourself.
---
nice try hilmar, we see through your alt reddit accounts
---
&gt; I think we all would be happier if we were fighting it out, instead of just stomping sandcastles.
---
That child already had stumbled into the well with "Citadel" &amp; "Lifeblood"
---
Don't overthink it. People have been saying eve was dying for as long as I can remember.
---
People will whine about ANY game. Doesn't matter what forums you go to, you will always see people complaining etc.
---
Do I think EvE is in a perfect state? No. I also think it has previously been in better shape than it is now. Doesn't mean the game is dead. And very big changes (either from devs or from alliance leaders) can happen at the blink of an eye.
---
So ... Mogul is not affiliated with PANFAM? It says so on reddit, it must be true.
---
as a fellow new player i can say that both he and you are right, new players are turned away by whines, but also veterans are moving away because of some questionable balance changes
---
At least it means our ticker is working.
---
Really? Obviously one you are incapable of understanding.
---
most people here on r/eve have already quit the game. they just want other people to quit so that they can justify their decision.  if it bothers you, don't visit r/eve.  98% of the posts here or comments are trash anyway.  join a corp, make friends, have fun, ignore the haters.
---
* Be a member of the north.  
---
* Be ashamed of your flair and game name.  
---
* Make a new reddit name weekly to flair bait and hide shame.    
---
* Conveniently overlook the actions that caused a rift (you attacking them) with GOTG/TEST/etc.  
---
* Conventiently overlook abandoning and using allies as meat shields and cringe post as they die. (co2/mordus/etc).  
---
* Collate a list of everyone PL or NC has shit on for a decade and try very hard to pretend like you don't know why it's happening.
---
It's the year 2021. Eve is still dying. Nothing new here.
---
You completely missed my point.
---
I was talking about how players feel. They feel CCP has been breaking their game for years (even though it's often not ccp's actions which do that), they are unhappy, they still play but they go to reddit and vent. It does not matter for them if it makes things better or worse, they are not rational, they are human. 
---
Why do they play even though they are unhappy? I'd say big part of it is sunk cost. Eve takes big investment to play, one does not get away from it so easy. And from the moment you are unhappy to the moment you finally quit you just whine, one way or another. 
---
I am in this state as well, but I have enough self-control to avoid spreading negativity, at least in public places like reddit. I just upvote the threads I support, though.
---
 There is some overhead, of course. Just undocking for 3 hours doesn't mean your pulling in 121 m3/s for 3 solid hours. There is travel time around a belt, drone travel time, time spent waiting for the indy core to cycle. Let's assume a 50% overhead for all of that.
---
100m isk is a very solid average to assume a rorqual makes isk wise from normal ore anomalies, if this helps your calculation at all.
---
I mean, it wasn't defended either- so it doesn't count.
---
Yeah in my corp. there's this split view of Rorq's as AFK ISK-printing machines and Rorq's as low-yield-for-their-risk-and-investment machines. Even something like VNI ratting is a competitive alternative to Rorq. mining because, while you make less ISK/hour, VNI's cost a fraction of the price, break even within just a few hours, an alpha can fly them rather than an autismo-skilled Omega, and can be multi-boxed. People in corp. often say "BuT rAtTinG iS aCtIvE aNd MiNiNg Is AfK!" Rorq. mining is only AFK if you feeling like having your excav's bombed or booshed or feel like having your Rorq. hit by Bomber's Bar when you decide to go take a shower while mindlessly chewing that spod. rock. An upside, though, is that when you multi-box Rorq's, you can essentially monitor all Rorq's simultaneously from one account because they're all on the same grid, whereas multi-boxed ratting requires you to regularly switch between your instances. But ultimately, and while I'm certainly not going to do the math like you have, Rorq's have a higher ISK/hour than many activities, but they are deceptively active, are harder to scale, and likely fall quite a bit short as a viable scaling income source when you consider skills investment and outright ship/fit investment.
---
Meta BPCs? Are there any humans racial modules that you can make from BPCs? I've never seen one.
---
Thanks mate!
---
wait, GOTG and the imperium are besties now ? and red to pandemic ? What did I miss ? what happened since I left  last year ? oO
---
That's a long way of saying "no u".
---
People keep on and keep on doing this - I'm not saying don't ever say a word or complain about anything, I'm saying the CURRENT method emplyoyeed by the EVE player base is actually hurting it more than helping. If CCP makes a bad balance change - then complain sure, but the CONSTANT EVE DEAD DON'T PLAY - is not the correct way to do this.
---
Yea of course it's not truely afk in the strictest interpretation of afk. That is why i said "virtually afk".
---
But compared to most activities in eve it is still on the low effort side of required at keyboard activity. God forbid that you have to check in on your 8b isk each assets every 2-3 minutes.
---
Fuck off with that cruiser bomber the game doesn't need that. THe game also has seen plenty of new ship recently and doesn't need new ones.
---
&gt; wisdow
---
This place is full of impotent rage fueled fat virgins with the social prowess of a used condom. Just ignore this place and enjoy the game.
---
Cool, how does that address panfam having lower rates than public though?
---
Honestly, man - You get it. I think this may be the best route - people are rediculously toxic and aggressive to their own community, the very community they cry about shrinking. It's quite sad actually.
---
You are new. New people (to quite everything) tend to get to a special place on their way. It's called Mount Stupid. Look it up.
---
And yes the game is amazing. For a while. But as soon as you start to see beyond the nice wrapper you also start to see the problems Eve has. And that CCP does too little to address them.
---
Highsec, where the real battles are fought.
---
Many criminals paid the price :)
---
Perhaps try and word it in a less ambiguous and more appetising way? 
---
Currently, it looks like is a turd, is it a plastic one or a real one? 
---
Safer to down vote and get rid of it.
---
You know what. . .I admit that Star Citizen has problems. The release dates have been pushed back, but they have had to switch game engines and heavily modify them. With Star Citizen they have explicitly stated that they will never give a hard release date, simply because there is a lot they want to do and they don't want to be rushed. Squadron 42 is kind of the exception, because it is smaller in scope, but even then Summer 2020 is the Beta targeted release date.
---
Now, I wasn't trying to shame Eve-Online or any other game, just offer a reason why player counts have declined and continue to do so. Obviously, everyone in this subreddit either plays or is interested in playing Eve-Online and telling someone their favorite toy is not the coolest toy anymore never makes them feel any better, but it is the hard truth. 
---
Instead people like to bash an incomplete game that is still under heavy development and barely in Alpha because it makes them feel better about whatever they're playing at the moment. 
---
I've shared my opinion, and will thus stop replying to this thread.
---
Just on that ...
---
During the Extinction War, Guardians were part of the NCPL bloc.
---
Due to a couple of factors, the highest of which is 'Actually, NCPL are pretty shit at using supercaps', NCPL lost that war.
---
Showing their amazing diplomatic skills, NCPL then reset Guardians, who Imperium then accepted as allies.
---
So, if you want to blame anyone for Guardian ending up with Goons, blame whatever idiots were running NCPL's standings.
---
Actually, given the last part of that bloc was part of NCPL during WWB/Casino War, I can confidently say that at the end of this war another NCPL ally will get thrown off the bus and end up blueing Goons for self defence.
---
Your also not factoring in using those other 4 accounts (primary rorq account is always 'in use). They will also have skills to fly mining barges or even a short train to exhumers. Having a single rorq mining + 4 Skiffs for example, will vastly speed up transition times from exhumer miner to Rorq miner due to extra income generated (could be up to 1 or 1.5 rorqs worth of additional income per hour depending on skills and such).
---
what 14 years, this guy plexxed his alphe 6 months ago and has just injected his first Rorqual alts. How should he know of 14 years of EVE ... ?
---
There is a concept in irl geopolitics of "status quo powers," as opposed to "revisionist powers." The latter want to shake things up to see if they can get a better deal for themselves, while the latter are right where they want to be, or stand to lose more than they could gain by shaking things up.
---
The big blocs in Eve are all status quo powers.
---
You are wrong if you think nullsec players don't think it's in a bad spot. The best thing that could happen to the game now is cap skill injectors to stop working at like 15m sp, remove mining from rorquals/remove excavators, and remove/change tz tanking. Even if goons, test, and init all were like fuck it, disband and form smaller groups with no treaties.... without changing those other things we will go right back to the way it is now
---
Shut the fuck up kid, YOU are the problem, not him.
---
Heavy stealth bomber that can be used against caps that’s slow to warp off... if only we had Black Ops Battleships or something.
---
What is it today with people totally incapable of backing up anything they say. 
---
Why say anything at all.
---
Thats what I thought.
---
This is so true
---
No, let's just paper over the obvious balance problems with new shinies! /s
---
You have to understand that these problems are 3 years old. We've been through all other methods available to us a dozen times by now and most people feel like CCP won't do anything until the shit really hits the fan, which finally seems to be happening.
---
I was hoping it would be this image when I clicked it
---
Everything short of a carrier ratting is low activity mate.
---
&gt; Existential threat? NCPL has like 5k characters combined
---
&gt; "NCPL **was** an existential threat to Legacy **for a long time.**"
---
Reading comprehension, dude. Also, do you think we always had this super fleet that we do now?
---
tbf the fact that he uses t1 bombs in a slippery ship makes him less of a target. Sure he's in a `5b killmail`, but when giving the choice of a t2 fit Marshal kill or a mach with 2b worth of mods fit, it's not exactly a difficult decision.
---
Be there change you want. Log in and undock instead of shitposting on reddit.
---
&gt; positioned yourselves properly for the current war didn't ya
---
No they did not, as I wouldnt have too. I just do not like sspending my max. 10 hrs of EVE a week with sitting in a Rorqual Multibox for 1.5 years to be in the position for this war (and this is the only way, as all other ways were patched out).
---
Hmm, you got downvoted into oblivion, I get upvoted. Seems more are angry with you than me.
---
The best thing for you to do is to quit while you are only marginally behind, since you will never be ahead.
---
"Thought" - riiight
---
Look, you guys pointing the bot finger need to chill the fuck out. I can get a 100mn VNI aligned and drones scooped before interceptors can scan and warp usually. Watching local to see hostiles jump in isn't hard either. You're trying to use criteria for identifying bots that aren't actually good at identifying them.
---
Any enhancements that require more co-operation between players.
---
Keep it hardcore.
---
No skill injectors.
---
Nerf AFK VNI ratting and anything else that facilitates easy botting.
---
Keep the old map.
---
Rebalance C4s a bit.
---
Require all players to join a player corp (NPC corp membership would be permitted for a limited time only).
---
Remove the MWD cloak trick.
---
Forward operating bases (short term, easy to anchor beachead style).
---
Nerf local chat.
---
Ramming mechanics could be interesting.
---
Space stations that can move (slowly).
---
Orbital mechanics (i.e. not static like today).
---
Solar radiation actually matters (proximity, exposure time).
---
Space debris can cause problems.
---
More realistic space physics (more space-like, less water-like).
---
Gravitational wells matter.
---
Magnetars and Pulsars are actually quite hazardous.
---
Manual docking procedures (akin to classic Elite).
---
EvE is forever dying.
---
Funny that Horde does exist, and that goons deployed their super fleet inside Geminate only once, to destroy the Sotyo sold by the Russians on the way out and in use by Horde to build Supers...
---
&gt; helicopterdicking every small and up and coming alliance
---
None of these are small alliances. 2013 brave maybe qualifies as up and coming, but as the poster above already pointed out HERO was well established at the time.
---
And legacy during the last panfam invasion (the nut up or shut up one lmao) was not the small helpless bambi that it liked to portray itself as at the time. Although i can understand the unwillingness to fight out the slug fest that that war would have been.
---
The inclusion of provi is ironic, didn't they get fucked over by Legacy after PL got kicked out of the conflict?
---
This game is NOT happy carebear land in space. Quit trying to make it that way.
---

wars over bois, nc wins the win
---
I haven't quit yet. I just know the OP is a little bitch that needs some HTFU.
---
Whilst there have been some... issues, overall citadels in WHs have been pretty good - they make it easier for newer players to get into WH space...
---
So, you think that players aren't watching local and pulling out the instant the usual cloaky campers aren't the only non blue inn local? Because that's exactly how I run VNIs, one eye on local and the other in intel channels. Your criteria for botting is weak.
---
well... that's what's wrong in this game : player base :)  
---
Getting old and always more toxic
---
What's do you suggest panfam do in this situation?
---
Faction smarties give him a larger kill radius though, although i dont think its much of an issue for him.
---
i swear whenever i see a reply like the one you replied to, i can't imagine what those people are doing.
---
this comment is too hard for him to understand
---
Agreed, you can find a shitton of bots  since Frat is helping them push into the area.
---
Make a good game, people will play.
---
Make a shit game, and people won't. 
---
It's that simple, no matter what you pretend.
---
The problem with the player base is it is turning soft like you and the OP. Take Permaband's advice and HTFU.
---
thank you for your service
---
This is correct!
---
He nailed it
---
you need to look up what projection is, if everyone itt is calling you an idiot, someone noticing that and telling you to realize your own agreed upon stupidity is not projection
---
for us to have received a benefit, whether or not there was a lower rate, we would have had to take it
---
We had 3rd fleet forming don't worry :D:D:D
---
The vast majority of people quitting and fed up with CCP are either alliance level leadership/FC folk or people in smaller groups, both of which are getting their content stomped out of the game by piss poor mechanics.
---
They are going out their way to play in a `less boring way`, most even providing entertaining content for other dudes, but when the time commitment for this playstyle keeps getting bigger and bigger it's not exactly surprising that they can't really be fucked anymore.
---
&gt; YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.
---
I am not. I am having fun doing here exactly what YOU think is a problem, but guess what, it is YOUR problem, so stop acting like we all do have the same problem. Cause we obviously don't.
---
Now, kindly please, suck my dick and fuck off.
---
This is so ironic. You are literally a shining beacon of an example of what I'm taking about. Negative and hateful. You ARE this post. Well played
---
i had tons of fun pre 2014
---
Nope, not any more.
---
For every other type of meta module, the balance is between reprocessing for minerals, and using the module in invention to increase the chances of T2 bpc.
---
I guess CCP didn't want meta disintegrators dropping and being reprocessed/invented for cheaper/easier construction of T2.
---
We need to be able to have more than 5 drones in a carrier..I want 25 heavy combat drones at once with 10000 dps.
---
If you repost, I'll just report for spam.
---
You want everyone to follow your rules, but it appears the actual rules mean nothing to you.
---
You might have a valid point, but you’re coming off as a complete cunt
---
well seems like you disproved your point by yourself - eve IS dying
---
Except for that major war encompassing the entire south
---
You don't at all need them if you're decent at hitting the buttons on time, they just give you a wider window to react.
---
Disband CONCORD

Nobody is trying to make it that way. Some says hey things should be at least a little better, and you talk about care bears, not a strong argument mate.

&gt;kill a newbie player in an explo ship
---
&gt;DM him
---
&gt;"good fight bro"
---
&gt;he replies "suck my dick faggot I'll kill you irl" or something along those lines
---
&gt;me "wow and here I was about to replace your ship"
---
&gt;this happens more often than not
---
No, I don't think it's the vets alone.
---
The problem is this is a more hardcore game so only the most stubborn of people---whether nice but stubborn or rude and stubborn---will keep playing. Naturally, because of the sandbox nature of the game and the fact that things like scamming, espionage, theft, etc are not only allowed but encouraged, the game leans towards rude and stubborn people. 
---
So yes some players are a problem but no there's little to nothing that can be done. And trying to make the game more newbie friendly, etc everyone lives happily noone ever dies in Eve is an oxymoron.
---
So I see your concern, but there's just nothing that can be done. I hate to sound like a dick at the end here, but your options are suck it up and deal with it or find another game. Eve is a game inherently parasitical; one man's misfortune is another's fortune.
---
I would say that mining rorquals were the biggest mistake CCP made.
---
It caused far too much mineral inflation in game and has lead to size of the supercapital umbrella.
---
LMAO good job CCP

Well... You started yo unanchor a few days before Goons deployed... So they are not evicting you. LEL
---
One of the largest and deepest simulations ever made is just "the nice wrapper"? I can't even begin to justify that..
---
&gt;If you're bored in the sandbox maybe it's because you choose to play in a boring way....
---
it's a sandbox, but for someone who has played for 5 years you can pretty much get into everything, and easily know the things you like and do not like, let alone nearly two decades.
---
Did you look at what it might cost to just buy an already trained rorqual pilot?
---
r/eve is not the eve community.  it is just a sub community.  your community should be the people you play with every day, e.g. your corp, your alliance, your enemies.
---
Says the guys that killed FW and lowesec in the North, lol.
---
Genuinely who were the small entities they were dicking over? I've only came back to the game in 2016 and they haven't don't it since, nor am I aware of them doing it when I originally played
---
He legit just started playing the game. Also are you calling him a pussy for not mindlessly feeding to the slicer?
---
If you take the average system in Eve, you're probably alone in it. The dangerous thing with lowsec is that if there's someone else in system, he's probably out there to fight, or going somewhere to fight. Most people in lowsec are there to fight since PvE is safer and/or more lucrative in both HS and null. If you go through null (or hs for that matter), most people you'll encounter are usually doing some kind of PvE activity. If you roam through null as a neutral, most people will simply dock up once they see a neut in local. You're only really in danger if they decide to set a trap for you to get you out of there (most of them will just wait until you leave), or if you encounter a gatecamp. If you're in your own space in null, you won't really encounter a gatecamp that's not friendly, because it would quickly be attacked by your own superior force and destroyed, so roaming around is actually pretty safe. If you pay attention to local and dock up when a local enters system, you're basically always safe.
---
no one mentioned imperium war because
---
But, tbf, lots of rorquals just reduce their own isk/hr.
---
It isn't an isk faucet since there is no isk generated.
---
Ok CCP_Falcon good job on the alt account almost had me fooled
---
This is the kind of player who comes into the game, gets killed once, spews some toxic shit in Eve mail about how players like you are ruining the game and then quits. He won't last 2 months.
---
I'm not against this tbh
---
can i have your stuff
---
LMAO so many good posts today
---
Sp loss was never a good mechanic, that's why they took it away from pods. 
---
They were stupid not to remove it from t3s when they did the last balance pass.
---
Maybe if you wouldn't come of as the "hey I am right, anyone who disagree  with me is wrong" kind of prick, more people would listen to you.   But you do you ... 
---
In before "YOU ARE THE PROBLEM"  ... blah blah
---
\&gt;get all the good pvpers to quit
---
\&gt;retarded krabs now become the top of the foodchain
---
\&gt;now all 40 year old child having dad gamers are capable of being space relevant
---
It seems rorquals are fine in and of themselves, but the nature of the modern nullbloc is what harm's it all
---
This is blatantly incorrect and idk where you saw that on the report because that's not what the graph shows.
---
Running burner missions, farming blue loot in wormholes, incursions, L5 blitzing etc.
---
There are so many money making activities that actually require you to sit at your computer and pay attention. 
---
Now, i'm not saying that mining should require you to constantly be at your keyboard. All the activities above net you more money than a single rorq can. But none of the activities are as scaleable as multiboxed rorqs. 
---
Ressource availability is a much bigger factor in this than the afk-bility of rorqs. Doesn't change the fact that rorquals are so popular because you don't have to pay that much attention to them. The reason why noone ever really complained about 20 exhumers sitting in a belt (despite the same scaleability existing here) is because it requires such a cancerous amount of effort.
---
With a rorq it is warp to rock, drop depot lock spod and mine away. It's just one more convenient strength of the ship ontop of already being the best mining platform in the game.
---
Why are you speaking for the community now? Who is mad that this guy is "trying to represent" them, and what makes you think any one person represents a whole?
---
To be fair it was actually made in a high command meeting later that night
---
yes, it's correct.
---
the allegiances of renters are based on the allegiances pf their landlords, for that is the only link they have to any side. Once their landlords are no more that doesn't male sense. Fuck most of the HRE renters would be counted on the side of xix had this been a year earlier
---
i mean several wars just broke out, it'd be depressing if it wasn't the highest in 3 years
---
Endgame is equilibrium. *Serenity Stasis.*
---
We're not there yet, but the that future is clearly visible on the horizon.
---
yeah but don't be alpha dude
---
He'll probably continue killing expensive pods after being killed, just with his ego a bit bruised.
---
Easy solution: neg wallets. neg Wallets of players, alliance and the alliance where the money goes to. I don't give a fuck, noone can tell me "they didn't knew".  
---
And if you can draw lines to someone putting up bots just to neg the wallets of their enemies, neg their wallets too. And if people don't stop botting ban in the same order.   
---
All this has to be done the same way you treat cancer: If it grows and kills the body you cut it out and shoot the rest with lasers.
---
shut up
---
I mean.. Lol at these replies to someone saying "Don't do things that hurt what you love". It's pure anger. And insults. And projection. It's quite disappointing
---
&gt; Its a check I make when I see retards posting something crazy on reddit.
---
So... uh, Would you like to link your main characters zkill?
---
Shouldnt this be "we didnt want those ships, anyway" or maybe "Goon died in delve today too"?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
No, it wasn't cool or elite then nor is it cool or elite now.
---
At least PL were outnumbered.
---
Come on, the guy was generous enough to assume someone with 5 rorqs is only online 15 hours a week!
---
Never once said the word community in that reply. And hey man, use your skull, that would be ME you fucking moron, the EVE player your TALKING to.
---
Can bubbles (from deploying a bubble, sabre or HIC) be used at all in lowsec? Will the button not work? What about smartbombs in hs? Will you get concorded or will the button not work?
---
Have you seen the reddit posts from WWB. Gotta take a minute and research them....it was much like this. Maybe worse.
---
"lol just stop PvPing more than once every 8 months idiots"
---
First graph of the monthly economic report,that shows destruction, mining and production. Destruction was stable à 1T between July and novembre 2017 when alpha became a thing. Then it climb to 1.5T and oscilate between 1.3 and 2T after that.
---
I mean it's not really like it does shit, level 5 subsystems take like 4 days each to train with remap and +4s.
---
then you realize you can train it for free (cost of plex) for several months, bringing the total cost down to less than a fourth of what you said, and then realize that rorquals mined significantly more (and for higher ore value) on the patch they released and see how people ended up with 40 rorq alts
---
Would you have more fun with one more account ? Would you be able to achieve more ?
---
&gt; People seem to very quickly forget how close Test and Goons were to going to war in 2018 before PL came in
---
Not at all?
---
dude, i am sure you're having fun and all, but your alliance has 30 active characters and 2 active corps. are you really saying that rote kapelle is as healthy as it's ever been? that a bunch of the playstyles you used to enjoy aren't dead?
---
Don't hate the player hate the game. Rorq imo are a butched attempt  by ccp to introduce conflict drivers into nullsec. Now that we know that 10min invuln timers are not the way to go i'd wish for ccp to actually iterate on the content but we know how swell their track record is in that regard.
---
**The problem was the respawn rate of the rocks they were mining, not the rorquals themselves.** Too much safety in one location allows for unlimited afk mining.
---
Eve is dead though
---
i find it fascinating how on one breath people can complain about not enough independent groups and on another complain that ncpl didn't want to literally kill goons.
---
it would be easier not to get hung up on it if it wasn't your tl;dr conclusion
---
"We can contain them in delve" lmao
---
It's as good a time as any to remember that while we certainly had our share of time in their position, we managed to muddle through it without claiming that the game was dying because of it.
---
Renters don't have allegiances, they pay rent to krab in peace. So it doesn't make sense to include them on any side
---
This place can't be saved. Get out while you still have your sanity.
---
Honestly? Yeah
---
If you're this thin skinned that you'd get trigged by a comment on r/eve, you're not gonna last long.
---
Either that, or you will, and you'll just stick around in highsec crying about how the game is too unfair. 
---
Take your pick, I don't really care.
---
Are you a ritard?
---
Once you're done training a character into something, you should just start skill farming them and PLEX them. Depending on PLEX, extractor and injector pricing, you might even make a profit from doing this. That way, you won't have to pay nearly a 100$ a month to mine. Also, if you're still ready to pay that much, why not just buy PLEX and sell it? You'd probably make more ISK with that 100$ than paying for 6 simultaneous accounts and mining (presumably) in HS.
---
Never said that, but you clearly feel like I did. At what point did I say some one was verifiably wrong just because they disagree with me?
---
Yes, I'll wait.
---
And the toxic people commenting are in fact the problem. This post revolves around not being toxic to new players, and the owner of the post is a new player, who is being dragged through toxicity for telling people not to be toxic. You do see the irony here, yes?
---
Rebrand dominix as strike carrier. Add line of subcap strike carriers. Field 10 normal drones instead of 5
---
It adds an additional layer of safety for PVE players.  CCP realizes that there are far fewer potential customers interested in the hard knock life of pure pvp than there are for the quiet life of HS carebearing.
---
The problem, is that CCP is absolutely fucking terrible at creating PVE content.
---
Im sure the dec changes will increase highsec PVE player count, but null player count seems to be dropping at an alarming rate as the donut congeals further into existence.
---
&gt; you really are pushing the limit on how retarded you are
---
Thanks, guess ill finish up training for T2 cruise launchers
---
Next your gonna start screaming "no puppet"?
---
I'm assuming you would be kiting with the Tristan?
---
&gt;So that they can pretend they're good by crawling out of their little holes to gank at literally CODE-level stupid ease
---
It's crawling now is it? They must be insects, those wormholers omg so disgusting.
---
We call it having fun raking in the tears. But that's just one small part of it. Everyone knows about wormholers' sweet heavy armor brawls involving literally 3 caps and a few dozen subcaps from the aggressor side in c5 space, for example.
---
No dread bombs were not there reason why keepstars were unanchored- you can't even do dread bombs in wormholes. You're thinking about null instead. 
---
You really don't know what tires talking about.
---
And no, no one unanchored keepstar a
---
Does your family know about your badposting?
---
Who do you mean? People in game? Corp? Forums? Reddit?
---
Respectfully disagree. I believe it’s up to 1t structures killed so far. I mean it’s boring as hell to me personally. I was ecstatic when we killed the 2 PL titans evacing so I see where you are coming from on fun factor. But “getting farmed” on the dudes that didn’t deploy is kinda meh.
---
Rip server. This used to be how they were (10 drones), but it put too much load on the server during fights. So they reduced it to 5 drones. Only the Guardian Vexor is able to field 10 drones.
---
A pvp-entitity seeking out pvp. Then actually executing said pvp efficiently = seal-clubbing? 
---
The only thing that pl ever did that came close to seal-clubbing was catch 2013, and at the time aside for the usual propaganda i think HERO were actually pretty happy about the content on their doorstep.
---
&gt;we don't use the benefits that have been made available to only us so clearly we aren't aligned
---
That's you, that's the logic you're trying to tell me right now.
---
OP apparently hasn't seen the Discord yet, this place is positively welcoming compared to the general chat there.
---
Lmao
---
I say : let's not do anything to run off new players
---
BBTB2: FUCK NEW PLAYERS THEY PUSSIES
---
No need for new ships.. just fix and balancing what's broken so far.
---
#hahah
---
"blurt tapi iznt playng how i want, blurg!"
---
I'd rather they not release anything new at the moment and fix the languishing ships like navy battleships/cruisers and tweak existing T1 battleships.
---
For the sake of the thread/post though, if new ships were released, i'd enjoy seeing either T2 or T3 ABC's and Caldari getting one with missiles instead of hybrids. Kind of tired of only seeing trig stuff for new ships.
---
i can only get so erect

I'm not sure if he's trolling of if his entire brain has been replaced by spod.

---
No bubbles in lowsec, also no ship launched 'bombs' (stealth bomber) or AOE titan DDs.
---
Sorry, we all know PL's primary objective was the health of the game.
---
The problems in the game have nothing to do with the big alliances.  I'm not sure what you're suggesting we do about it.
---
We *all* want titan effectiveness against subcaps nerfed.  We all think the GTFO module was one of the dumbest things ever added to the game. 
---
I think we pretty much have all the same ideas to fix the game.  You just seem salty that the North is getting dicked at the same time.
---
Did you just imply NC has the same size as TEST or Goons?
---
its literally my name
---
And then he literally admits he's not only the problem, but he continues to and enjoys perpetuating it. Nice.
---
You can try but the daredevil is much much faster, that being said hopefully the daredevils is on speed tank so point web and pray your drones kill him before he kills you. Pretty good feeling killing a 70/80 mill daredevil in a 10mill Tristan.
---
You're the most toxic person I've ever seen here.
---
You bullied groups even smaller than you compares to Goons.
---
It was fun being the Hammer. Now is your turn to be the anvil.
---
Something you didnt well, ir Even everyone who hates Goons is happy with what is happening. -because, we are :) -
---
Oh noo! The poor, small, new alliances... boohoo... Obviously Goons and Test never did that in the past. We all know how friendly to everyone they are. As for your first statement - I take it you believe 0.0 gameplay is fine at this time, right? With the strategic content either being sov-laser/instaceptor bullshit, ferox bullshit or thousand titans bullshit. Rorquals that are immune to attack when basic precautions are taken, citadels that can't be destroyed unless you have numbers superiority, oh and don't forget the GSF patented strategy of "blob or blueballs"... sounds fun, right? Well, if you think it is - you're a fucking idiot. If you think that just because someone was a bully to some cute lil newbies warrants ruining the game for literally everyone that likes actual, meaningful fights - you're a fucking idiot. Oh, and if you believe CCP shouldn't step in and literally turn this fuckdump on its head by some serious gameplay alterations - guess who you are.
---
+
---
Just bring back the old timers at least
---
Bubbles will not work at all in Low sec.  Smartbombs, however, do work in high sec, you just have to be careful where you use them as if you hit someone/something neutral with them then Concord will spawn and kill you
---
wow, its so nice to see fw players mentioned in a post
---
Ultimately, I agree with the scaling concern. I am also of the mind that even if they are changed at this point you will see fleets of exhumers, so it won't change all that much and you will remove a huge content driver from the field. I used to rorq mine with 6. I haven't done that in a year, it really isn't the game play I am looking for right now. I enjoyed it then, I could sit at the comp and BS and relax while getting my toys. Now I have my toys and I personally find it more fun to take out ships and to go find those rorquals to kill; but I know there are others that still enjoy the first part. But back to scaling- it should be kept in mind that the lowest common denominator will be scaling VNIs or barges, so if anything gets nerfed below that point- you will see an influx of ships that keep generating isk while being able to easily get out. People will always min/max to make isk. Personally, I want more ships that are in space and need to stay in space to make isk so they are content. Two big changes I would move for would be a combat timer for ratting AND said combat timer also removing the ability to enter a POS. It's only 60 seconds, but that is a lot more time to catch someone than 0-5 seconds. I also find myself moving slowly towards the concept of a slight delay in local. Something size based perhaps, 6/4/3/2/1 seconds or even just until they decloak. But part of me wanting that change is botters. I can catch people that are people and have human reactions. Bots are just infuriating.
---
i need to say something, Titans are still rare. and when titans are tackled, it's almost always a CTA for the alliance, sometimes coalition wide.
---
Branch is the one region we will be disappointed to roll into even though it's lit up with NPC kills all over, because we know it's likely all bots, which which are too much trouble to catch.
---
When I read this thread and comments, there was not a single comment by someone who disagreed with you, that you didn't call out as a "part of a problem" and being toxic. 
---
And at first people were giving you legitimate answers. You might disagree with them, but that doesn't make their opinion toxic.

When you started your rage reply's, people started baiting you, seeing how long they can make you rage.

There is a place where no Pilot can see. We are repelled by it, terrorized. It is said a man will come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye. He will look where we cannot.
---
People express frustration because they love the game.
---
If we hated EVE Online we wouldn't give a shit about it. Instead, sometimes players do the only thing they know how to do when they really care about something that looks bad but is outside their control; the cry and curse the gods.
---
You won't find a community like this one in any other MMO; Fanfest and the player meetups are a fantastic example.
---
Welcome to the community, but try to look past the negativity; it isn't aimed at you, dear newbie, it's aimed at us in futility instead.
---
Not the game. Just NCPL. You think too high about yourself if you consider yourself the game. Or you do this to cry for daddy CCP help?
---
"Here" is where?
---
;)
---
You eat shit for breakfast?
---
Peligro bans 15 bot  accounts and CCP be like "We're still fighting the good fight guys!"
---
Meanwhile 44 new bot accounts were made in the same time frame.
---
\&gt;muh PL helidicked people with supers too
---
Yeah but PL didn't have the economic capability to make any losses they did take completely meaningless. PL also didn't profit from the massively defender-favoring citadel and sov mechanics if anyone every tried to disrupt their space.  PL. also wasn't nearly half of null players by themselves. They also weren't allied with another third. PL. also couldn't multibox dozens of rorqs, with almost no risk, to drive mineral prices through the floor. PL also couldn't field the biggest subcap and capital fleet in any battle they chose to commit to. 
---
Sure PL was rather powerful in it's prime, but they were at no point as powerful and consolidated as goons are right now.
---
Gisleres, you can find it through the agency window.
---
Sounds like eve forgot how test turned against goons early in their life then.
---
Hilmar: We'd rather experiment and get it wrong.
---
Also Hilmar: SP loss stays. Buy skill injectors. EVE is hard.
---
Well simply face the fact that this game has lost 2/3 of its playerbase since 2013/14 not because they were driven away by salty reddit posts, the salty reddit posts come from 2/3 of the player base being driven away by shitty (and with this I mean stuff you question peoples mental health) game design decisions since 2013.
---
This game was once quite balanced between larger &amp; settled PvE-focussed groups and nomadic PvP-Groups. Since 1 special patch in 2017 this balance is no more. If you do not like to spend the few hours a week you play with static, repetitive and boring PvE-Grind, you basically have no income anymore to do stuff in game you have fun with ...
---
/woosh
---
Excuse me, ganking isn't risk free at all. You lose every ship you shoot with if you didn't know. That means it's 100% risk of getting destroyed.
---
&gt;thinking that smarts has anything to do with nullsec combat un tyool 2k19
---
:omegalul:
---
+1 peraps we can ask our future CSM to do something about it...
---
I think we're on a precursor theme at the moment, so perhaps there will be a new percursor race introduced within the next 12 months.
---
Personally I would like to see the marauders see a re-envisioning as a heavy skirmish combat vessel with T3 mechanics similar to the dessies with different modes (the problem with the T3D modes is often you end up dead before swapping modes can make a material difference, especially in fleet combat. Introducing the mechanic at a BS level would really rack up the tactical usage).

Not hating my dude. Just want nullies to know.

Definition of a Sandbox game
---
&gt;*A sandbox is a style of game in which minimal character limitations are placed on the gamer, allowing the gamer to roam and change a virtual world at will. In contrast to a progression-style game, a sandbox game emphasizes roaming and allows a gamer to select tasks.* 
---
My point is
---
* a sandbox game is *no longer* a sandbox game if it corals people into only a few styles of play.
---
* The '*Boring*' the previous user mentioned is the boredom involved with being restricted harder and harder in his style of play (*PvP*) until that style stagnates. A victim of that corralling.
---
* With changes no emphasizing progression and restricting free will of approaching the game in a variety of ways, EvE is beginning to lose the very soul that made it so popular in the first place.
---
*Words are hard, I think I repeated myself a lot then, whoops*
---
Time is a flat circle.
---
Oh, hello fellow RAGE ex-member then. We stalled DRF for 4 months in Geminate. Burning the entire alliance out so much that by the point they came to Vale we had nothing left. Sorry you only saw that - it was a solid old-NC-style alliance, we had a blast for a couple of years. Carebearish, sure, but we had good FCs and were willing to fight, even if WN/XIX/Solar were stronger back then and better organised. Some of those old RAGE FCs are in NC. of today (Col), some are elsewhere (goons, pl or even snuff, but no longer FCing). RAGE's core was with the old NC for a while too. With breaks, but most of us were in Pure. Alliance, together with what later became INIT. Fighting BoB and Tri of old under Codin and Sister Bliss.
---
And yes... the arrogance was probably the most defining trait of MM, in my experience as well, sadly. We warned them we cannot hold DRF indefinately.  We let them know in advance that DRF will hire PL to push their advantage after Geminate falls. They were told that the old tactic of Fortress Tribute won't work if they burn everyone out beforehand. MM were asked to call RZR from their deploymrnt with Goons, and for goons to be called in properly. "Eh, we are strong, we'll hold, why woukd we listen to the newbs like rage?"...
---
I'm rambling. Still convinced that the old NC could have survived for at least a few more years of only they listened. Also that is when I stopped caring and started playing the game how I play it now, logging in for hotdrops only.
---
Still doesn't make my statement any less true. If you wan't to provide some solid evidence though, I'm more than welcome to read it through!
---
* Those people over there have more assets than me. Let's reset so they don't have more assets than me.  
---
* Two years later. Hey, let's reset again.  
---
* You have more assets than the people asking for this. Wait, let's not reset.  
---
* Vicious circle ad infinitum.
---
OK, I actually read your post.
---
Indeed we have very little in this report. Yet we do have some food for thought.
---
The numbers for destroyed value are interesting because they directly relate to what players call activity. We can combine this number with another one the report gives : inflation is negligible in EVE.
---
From this we can say that either less players are losing more expensive ships than before, or more players are losing less or no less expensive ships than before.
---
Then it also depends on the activity : either there are more big wars with many big ships destroyed, or there are less of these. In the first case, it could hide a decrease in activity. In the second, it would reveal an increase in activity.
---
We can also exlude highsec piracy from the activity we seek. Then you look at the trend of destroyed goods in highsec. Substract this value from the global destruction of value and see what's left. I doubt that piracy increased much in the last years though, the numbers of destroyed value in jita look about the same than 5 years ago.
---
So I am rather confident that pvp activity overall didn't changed much over the last two years. Which would mean that EVE is as healthy as it was then.
---
But I'll gladly see where I'm wrong.
---
I miss the old Condor
---
Add Fade and half of Deklein to that list.  Hard to tell which is the worst offender: Gemini Whale United, Theran, or Ranger Regiment
---
I like the making PVE risky, would balance a lot of things.
---
Thundercats Hooooooo?
---
True, but hey. This is a game. Let's all play it together instead of one side running away constantly when they aren't assured a win.
---
Should think a out it before. NCPL put them selves un this shit storm. Even the people who hates blue donut, is happy seeing NCPL in shame crying yo CCP.
---
Mittani said they won't follow yo Dronelands. He just is giving the chance to do what they make un Delve.
---
So, start to move and embrace spodmain. Start to close broken ties with other groups. Stop yo play whackamole with new groups and independent ones, and you Will have a shot to rematch
---
&gt;you really are pushing the limit on how retarded you are
---
As i said, it is YOUR problem, i am just a fucked-up (literally) human being having fun pushing your buttons. And anyone elses too. :)
---
unblue goons and actually come play the game again ...
---
I want a pancake dreadnaught please. Astrahaus sized barghest.
---
Please, everyone knows people watch Netflix while VNI ratting. Your statement is false
---
Funny joke, got a laugh out of me
---
It came from Russian slang as a replacement for the previous antisemitic term. I don't know when it gained widespread use, but it has been at least a couple of years.
---
Had to join the party. WOOOOT!
---
Yep, i'm with you on all of that. On a fundamental level i appreciate that ccp added PANIC. When you see a rorq in space you know that it most likely won't directly be able to leave and it is myriads better than the 100th VNI of the night warping away from you.
---
But then they botched the implementation and gave rorqs defensive capabilities suited for an instant full capital escalation, instead of tuning it to roaming gangs being able to force fights by tackling rorqs and then fighting the backup fleet that comes in. The much needed fine tuning never really happened.
---
Porp says hello.
---
Sad but True

Why do we need to backstab our closest allies to play the game? Why can't our enemies just gang up on us like they did the last time?
---
Throw away 90% of reddit.  It’s all trash by trash posters or people quit or can’t afford to pay or are bad at the game and can’t plex.  Bitter old vets.  
---
I come here for the politics and the drama and intel. 
---
The problem is that ccp does tend to validate this cesspool by monitoring and actively commenting on threads.  Ccp could probably help this by sticking to official forums or other official communication channels and stay out of reddit and Twitter.  These two sites are nothing but echo chambers for the extremely vocal minorities of people and like has been said most of the more active and toxic voices have quit the game long ago.  
---
Just play the game like I am and enjoy.  You will absolutely never ever change this subreddit, and especially by coming out here and dumping a rorqual full of compressed salt for them to greedily enjoy.
---
"I'm unable to think for myself and comprehend the basic main point of an argument because tl;dr doesn't say so"
---
holy shit the literal fucking autism xD
---
You should absolutely share your opinions with CCP and the EVE community. You do not have a right to because you spent money, you have a right to because your a participant. And it is important that your message be impactful to CCP and beneficial to the player base, instead of just impactful and negative. Otherwise, other people will address the issue better and your voice will have only been a negative one that got in the way of others now beneficial words.
---
Command battleships that have the ability to jump caps
---
I think that sounds like a splendid idea.
---
I've always wanted to see a "tractor beam" pvp mod. You know. Pulls enemies towards you, or one that pushes.
---
What would you replace it with? The rorqual itself generates an immense amount of content. You can usually count on it getting you a great big fight or a great big killmail. If we change it so that people just don't use it or as many, by a wide margin, what would you suggest be added that replace that sort of content? There are not a lot of things out there that you can go attack that will generate those big fights reliably.

I love how TCUs and owning sov doesn't even matter. Whats the point of a TCU, anybody want to tell me? @ccp_fozzie
---
I know a few from the goon ballot are keen on scrapping attributes etc, but it wasn't a high enough priority compared to other things they wanted to raise, unfortunately.
---
I mean your definetly right, but I see myself doubting my future with eve because of the constant, community wide spread fear that they perpetuate. I don't want the next new bro after me to feel the same way. I will push through it a play eve for a long time coming. They however, may not. And I may be beating sand, but I at least have to say something if only once
---
Does there even need to be?   It’s a game dude.  Premised around blowing shit up.  
---
The narratives only need to be, “you there... drakes are shit vessels... I see you fly a drake.   You need to be removed from my overview”
---
and is he wrong? the renters dropping titans angle is kinda silly on all accounts but the thing that made them be on such a list is their link to skillu, once skillu disbanded do they really fit it? 
---
* saying the entire hre disbanded is kinda wrong actually cause hk still has renters
---
Here as in K space or here as in one of the sites?
---
With actual good fights and trades and strategy being employed.  
---
But fuck that shit that’s not at all relevant
---
We play Eve, that says it all really.
---
youre a fucking idiot go suck on some more dino cock
---
(Tinfoil rattling intensifies)
---
I'm not waiting my time on your comment bro, your instigating and nothing more. If you want to add something beneficial to the conversation they please do so, otherwise, shooting down people telling me I'm an idiot with nothing to support there argument is not an example of what you described.
---
Do not instigate and think it makes you win the argument. You have added nothing.
---
Well to be fair they’re all mostly ex players and just toss shit over the wall
---
Carebear is antisemitic?
---
&gt; How people can do that without being killed ? There is no red guys roaming and killing them ?
---
Rorquals do die, but not as much as they should imo. The problem is that they have a button called PANIC that makes them literally invulnerable for up to 7.5 minutes (based on skills). That time might have gone down recently, but I don't remember for sure.
---
Not only do they have a literal invulnerability button, but if they're fit right, with a little bling, they can tank 100+ cruisers worth of damage until they run out of cap charges. They are the tankiest ship in the game, maybe second to FAXes.
---
They can be killed, but it's an enormous pain in the ass if they are fit correctly. And that assumes that there's not a supercap umbrella there to save them.
---
Once upon a time the only thing you could do with a Titan was keep it logged off, or sitting in a POS with no pilot.  Docking in Keepstars was one of the changes that brought on the cap proliferation.  Before that to have a titan meant to have a dedicated but logged-off pilot.
---
Proliferation causes:
---
- Injectors
---
- keepstars
---
- plenty of minerals
---
Any good shield tanked amarr fit?
---
He's not new, it's just a freshly rolled account by a veteran player trying to spin a narrative
---
It may not be aimed at me zeroniss, but it hits and damages every new player to eve. This is a problem
---
The thing is, this does not show how many Titans nor Super Carriers coalition has. It shows how many Unique pilots have fielded counted ship past 3 months?
---
In 2009 they definitely did
---
also dont forget, one day he too will lose the marshal, just like this post

I agree with you, negativity has broader implications. I'm simply offering an explanation for it.

Good, fucking end us already fam, New Eden is ripe to go.
---
*takes coalition of everyone in game to kill goons*
---
This is fine.
---
*is crushed by coalition of everyone in game including goons*
---
GAEM IS DYING OMG CCP FIX UR GAME OMG
---
Ahh the sweet irony :)
---
Real question.  Why should it be invulnerable to smaller gangs?
---
It's large and complicated, but not deep. With "deep" meaning for me that even after doing the same activity for a long time I might encounter something new or surprising from time to time. But this doesn't happen.
---
I'm an explorer, so lets see. There are data, relic and combat sites to scan down.
---
Every relic site in all of the ~8000 systems of Eve has one of a hand full of layouts. They never change. If they are not in Anoikis they never have NPCs.
---
Every data site in all of the ~8000 systems of Eve has one of a hand full of layouts. They never change. If they are not in Anoikis they never have NPCs. There are some special kinds of these sites (sleeper and ghost), but they always have the same layout and follow the same rules.
---
Every combat site in all of the ~8000 systems of Eve has one of a hand full of layouts. They never change. I can look up which enemies will spawn and what drops.
---
Nothing of this has changed in years.
---
I'm an explorer, my fun depends on finding new things and seeing new sights. The game itself has not added much to this in a while.
---
The only other source of content to see is player-made. And with more and more playstyles disappearing due to a meta that CCP is afraid to shake up that gets stale too.
---
If all EvE players are bots it's not living and that means it cannot die.
---
PL used to be our buddies too you know. Everyone turns on us eventually.
---
Citadels haven't made it easier for new players it's taken away to risk of PoS living for both new player and vets alike, skill injectors made it easier for new players because it removed that initial skill limit of being able to cloak and have good scanning skills. Citadels make it more difficult to be evicted, you can citadel spam that much that it would be realistically impossible to remove you from a hole.
---
This game is 15 years old, but it only has about one year of pve content from a normal mmo.  The rest is player driven drama that CCP had nothing do do with and dont get to take any credit for.
---
PM’ed you. Thanks so much.
---
in what world is a rorqual that you will only find in 3-4 regions which are fully under an umbrella and only engage with more then 100 ppl who fly a boosh dessy or stuka comp great content
---
if shit got that bad they'd close down and then one year later announce eve 2… a full dive VR eve. And then the same thing would happen there
---
Right. I understand you're mad. 
---
You are not the community as a whole.
---
You say 'eve players' instead of community. Same thing different wording.
---
If you're going to try to insult my intelligence, maybe work on using the correct form of your/you're.
---

Triggered.
---
You join Arguments so you can tell people they are triggered.

You are so convinced of your own opinion, that when you parade around apathy and negativity and no one bites, you scream triggered.
---
Your a class act mate.
---
ITT: A bunch of people getting baited.
---
Maybe add squadrons of light drones instead. Like fighters. So a squadron of hobgoblins perhaps? :c
---
I've gone on hundreds of whaling fleets to catch and kill rorquals. My experience is that they have been great fights and it was fun to engage the subcapital and capital fleets that came to engage us. Having something that 100 of us in t3cs or stuka config can engage and fight in a large brawl has been fun. Not everything needs to be small gang restricted.
---
&gt; During the Extinction War
---
The what war?
---
And who said that PvE isnt most of the game. Your way yo play it is the right one and theirs is wrong?
---
Because, they are kicking you ass.
---
I decided to take you at face value on the off-chance you were serious. Its the internet I think I'll survive.
---
Because the game wasnt dying.
---
Game mechanics were somewhat balanced and didnt force bullshit timezone tanked structure grinding
---
Or.. you just inject your 5 first rorqals by buying PLEX and then multibox to get a new one every month.
---
Also to really decide if it is OP or not, one should compare the revenue generated to other forms of isk-making.
---
You may have an Eve account, but you are clearly not an "EVE Player".
---
So did i miss stage 2 of the invasion??? Or did they just skip that part and went to stage 3?
---
ITT: A bunch of people have a conversation and one guy random saying for no reason :
---
"ITT: A bunch of people getting baited."
---
Thanks. Noted.
---
PL's been a cunt to everyone since what, 2009?  That was their gameplay style.  Correct me on my timeline please.  Can't blame them for trying to smooth over  the historical narrative but in order to change history, one must be in charge in the present (e.g., "history is written by the victors"), and grath like most of PL's relevant leadership has been AWOL for more than a year.
---
you are correct but on the other hand everything atm is large scale restricted. i wonder what those 98 dudes do when the 2 fcs are not logged in...wait their are farming under their own umbrella. 10/10
---
Wouldn't that be a little bit too op ? Just my thoughts
---
Why do you fly a monitor (serious question)
---
Here's a simple yes or no question even a smooth brain like you can answer, does panfam receive lower than public rates in mogul structures?
---
Keep trying.
---
The non-counterplay is really a major issue and is very un-eve in its nature.  Caps always existed, but if you never encountered them because of rarity then they aren't as much of an issue.  
---
EvE was built on counterplay.  Stories like the Iteron that solo killed a BS are what made someone care more about being better/more knowledgeable than about having to skill up to the endgame.  It wasn't the bling that made "l33t" pilots great, it was that they knew how to use and fly that bling.  The bling had a strategic purpose, but F-up and it made for a shiny kill.  (That gold Magnate DID eventually die.)
---
Zkill used to be filled by people who thought they could bling their way to good pvp only to lose to T1 ships.  Have you noticed a lack of those kills in the last few years?  Now that player need only skill into Titans and rorqs and move to Delve.
---
Lmao ok mate, thanks for deciding that for me. Does CCP email you everyone a player kind the game do you can decide if they are "EVE players" or not? Your opinion of me means nothing and contributes nothing to the conversation.
---
Thanks for playing though.
---
i thought stage 2 was the major and minor conduits
---
The kestrel asymmetry makes sense. Some of the gallente asymmetry doesn't and just looks weird, at least to me.
---
They do what I and about 6 other dudes have been doing in INIT and take out smaller groups daily? It's been fun and I have been finding content in small groups despite the hurrdurr.
---
ofc you did. everything is great. content everywhere lmao
---
So how big is the damn thing?
---
This just reminds me of starving fish in a pond, and if shit falls in they will swarm and eat it.  GF’s my fish friends, or is it bees?  An entirely new definition of baited....
---
That could just be a mistaken mouse click as easy as it could be stupidity.  Case in point:  Asakai and DBRB.
---
First graph shows between 1 and 1.5T of destruction for the last monthish.  Back last August it jumped to above 1.5T.  Your statement that this is the highest destroyed value in 3 years is BLATANTLY FALSE even by the graph you are trying to show me is proof.
---
Hi I'm here to be verbally abused by OP.
---
It was a good brawl thanks for bringing the fun.
---
The whole Test vs Goons/CFC was a long drawn out ordeal that happened over the course of several years. Test didn't outright turn on Goons as much as they splintered away to do their own thing over time. However, Test did go out of their way to antagonize Fatal Ascension over and over again, and that was what ultimately got Test a boot to the face.
---
That's exactly what brave does to them in Impass though, what goons do to them in Delve and what TEST does to them in Esoteria if they aren't blue. The exact same as PL
---
Man you get it wrong. You shouldn't care about what the others think. Who care if "Eve is dying" (it's dead since the release from what I hear), the only thing that matters is that your enjoy it. 
---
Newbros don't leave the game because of these posts (or at least not that much), they don't care (at least in their early months) about the blue donut shit and all.
---
Plus the majority of these posts are justs to blow off some steam, or are ironic shitposts.
---
The hi-sec life doesn't interest me the slightest. Been there, done that, made me quit.
---
True -- the game mechanics merely allowed for one group to own the entire mineral wealth of the game, with what should have been a large surface area rendered meaningless by flux-coil and cap recharger supercaps that could, in some cases, cap up from a jump before their session timer elapsed. Not to mention the period of time when you could stuff supercaps through a titan bridge, eliminating even the need to cap up after a jump.
---
I never personally understood the appeal of being just another pilot in a small nullsec group.
---
&gt;The vast majority of people quitting
---
are NC
---
And then what?
---
BRAVE drop supers on solo players in frigates in Impass now while REQ types homophobic language in local so you are exactly the same as PL now, just worse for the game because PL reset people after wars and didn't also kill small gang roaming across the entire game.
---
Apparently this was a fozzie thing.  Something about the _flavor_ of t3cs.
---
It's absolutely stupid.
---
Good thing test is balancing it out by failing every campaign they start.
---
What is this? NC defending Mogul? But reddit said they are not affiliated.
---
lmao imagine being this retarded and actually thinking people are brigading to downvote you
---
&gt;they also removed station games
---
The one positive.
---
I've been insulted in this thread 20 odd times. Please copy and paste a personal insult I've said in this thread in the reply.
---
I'll wait.
---
Do you know how to read a trend? It's stable since  novembre 2017.
---
PL/NC fucked themselves by their "elitist" mentality and their super high bar for entry while goons/legacy were like fuck spies we'll take everybody who isn't too big of am asshole. With the exception of Horde, nobody in PanFam actually takes the time to take in and develop and protect newer players in the way the other groups do. They thought their super numbers would be enough to quash anything that came up and they're paying the piper for it.
---
Hey I just started playing, don't blow up the server just yet!
---
no u
---
Bots already target acquire by themselves. There are usually one or two rats that don't Redbox so we normally have to target them ourselves. That's why bots just manually target.
---
The change adding jump fatigue directly inhibited PL from “dick dropping” all over Eve.
---
Now, mechanics were put in place to virtually eliminate that, once again, allowing a huge entity to perform the same shenanigans.
---
I don't understand. Is this where you are expecting me to justify my statement or prove I am having fun? You seem to have a bad case of believing people on the Internet owe you something or are required to value your anonymous lofty opinion.
---
Wasn't talking about carebear. Was talking about "Jewing" which had heavy use throughout nulsec.
---
the war where a 40k coalition can't invade a 25k coalition? even with super cap supremacy? And where your leader even have to make a morale post where he calls everyone retards and complains about being in danger of getting evicted?
---
I know how to read a trend, but the last few months are not the highest in 3 years it was last august.
---
no you dont have to do anything. i just checked your killboard
---
Noted. Thanks
---
Oh wow. Must have been restricted to null sec use because never heard that one either
---
I'm glad that helped to convince you of whatever your bias deemed was factual before you checked it.
---
Virtually invulnerable for the duration of the new panic button. But that's a good question, my main idea was that so a couple of people in ships worth 200-300mil in total couldn't quickly kill a Rorq because that would be very frustrating for the Rorq pilot to lose it all quickly to a small roaming gang. My goal is to keep most of the functionality of the panic button, while removing it's invulnerability to everything in 5 mins. This would buff something like what Bomber's Bar is doing, or even medium-large roaming fleets, while not making the Rorq vulnerable to anyone who brings in a small fleet into Delve.
---
I could see the argument that making Rorq more vulnerable to any small fleets would be a good thing, but I'm trying to find a compromise in-between buffing attackers and keeping the Rorq somewhat safe still.
---
Your underplaying the reality of the situation. I'm one of the new bros feeling like the community is running me off. I'm the example, right here.
---
About 50km end to end
---
There is no conversation happening.
---
You made a statement, than attacked anyone who disagreed with you. Now people are just making fun of you.
---
So will the bubbles still deploy, but they won't do anything? Or will they not deploy at all?
---
Yea, that's the main thing, they need to make PvE an activity where a bot and a player actually appear differently. At the moment they are basically the same, one just has better reaction times. Krabbing in null has always been a braindead activity and so bots can easily do it and also be hard to distinguish from regular players at first blush.
---
It dies to a frigate swarm just like everything else. 
---
Until ccp patches it so it can't
---
Comment section is like Jita local here : )
---
Exactly. GG though mate
---
TAPI's victim complex is incredible.
---
NCPL have always been the big bad guy everyone hates for blobbing and dropping titans on everything, did you start playing in 2017 or something?
---
Aww come on Zero, you can be that cynical already
---
Goons circljerk and NCPL cry un Reddit and call to daddy ccp for help.
---
Meanwhile, Even the grr Goons and bluedonut haters, are enjoing. Because if anything un eve is worts than Goonies. That is NCPL.
---
And guyz, hope you like memes, because you are going to be EvE memed for looooong time. You put yourselves un this shit storm. Relax and enjoing.
---
I think with the current booshing mechanics they would be alright, it gets players on the same grid.
---
Keep the rorqs, half the PANIC timer. Then reduce anom respawn rates in nullsec so that there is not only conflict potential from the outside of an alliance but also the inside. We desperately need grudges that make people pick up arms against each other. 
---
F.e. if you were to tie anom respawn rates to adm (higher adm more anoms) with a fixed ceiling for how many anoms can spawn in a system in let's say a time frame of every 6 hours that would be a start. If you design it properly you can make it so that a single system f.e. would sustain a total 100-150 people farming in it from downtime-downtime across the tzs. Those numbers obv. are just placeholders, as you'd need the data that ccp has to set the correct limits.
---
This in theory would reduce the raw amount of minerals/isk entering the economy, hopefully giving actual value back to isk/expensive assets.
---
Further it would spread pilots out raising activity levels across a region, making space feel more alive. Also it opens up more fronts that can be attacked by roaming gangs, with distraction attacks creating an interesting interplay between aggressor and defender.
---
Another possibility is tieing bounty payouts to the adms aswell, allowing smaller entities to "develop" constellations with bad true-sec, and therefore actually having an economic reason to not just join up with one of the big blocks.
---
And then if there are concerns about players getting bullied out of the most profitable space by multiboxing pilots that just "locust-swarm" the ressources on respawn you can always add/update ressources in the game. F.e. ice mining has fallen out of favour, if you make ice mining products more useful in the economy you create more job opportunities for different players, therefor diversifying the money making activities/playerbases. 
---
It feels as if in the last couple years people got pushed into the same 3 activities (vni/carrier/rorq) due to a lack of viable alternatives. The game in it's current state has been min-maxed, it's time to shake it up.
---
In that same line of thought null desperately needs pve activities that are not scaleable/reliant on multiboxing. F.e. escalations are such a nice little ecosystem of hunters vs. shiny site runners. We need more such interactions.
---
That's great mate. People making fun of me after posting this affects me about a much as they did before I posted it.
---
I am now than happy to turn a few heads and step on a few toes if it helps the community in the long run.
---
And yes, it was a statement that spurred multiple conversations. You don't have to start with a question to have a conversation. This is simple everyday knowledge mate, not to be insulting.
---
I see it more like this:  Galactic catastrophe, New Eden and everything in it will be destroyed.  Scientists work on the Eve Gate and manage to re-open the hole but it doesn't go back home but somewhere else.  Everyone must leave or perish, but not everyone's clones will be able to go and even then, unknown forces may harm clones (ie., you'll lose some SP).  
---
New star cluster, new map, some old lore and blueprints may slip through but new environment to rebuild.  New enemies (NPC's) some old ones (Triglavians, Sleepers) and new corps, alliances, etc.
---
I think it may be time for CCP to consider the next generation of Eve.  I think the one we have is too broken to fix.
---
imagine not seeing the major differences in game mechanics
---
You didn't use to be able to extract the amount of isk/ore from a system that we're seeing today
---
Remove tether with npc timer
---
All you'd see is T3C's. they're already really strong subcaps, there should be a punishment for dying in one 
---
I think the most they could do is allow you to train your lost skills in a separate skill queue so you don't lose progression on your main skill queue but there's still a period of time where you can't fly the T3C
---
Someone PM our dear leader for a State of the goonion for this massive blow they dealt.
---
Ok... but what would you put in space that would replace the large fights generated from a sieged rorqual? Every single day there are half a dozen or more large fights over sieged rorquals. What structure/event/ship would be put into space to replace the actual fights that come from rorquals? Reducing the panic timer just says to me "we want to kill the rorqual before a response fleet shows up that we don't want to fight".
---
&gt;During the Extinction War

Can we stop making up retarded names for wars, there is only one name for each for, get with it.

FYI Osmium went out of service a long time ago, at least as far as I'm aware.
---
Why am I crying in the club?
---
Another note here OP.
---
In 20 minutes (safe time in a gas site), you can huff enough gas from a good site to buy yourself a fancy new Cruiser or Battlecruiser. Just huff for now. Find 3-4 good sites, and then take your fill and fit out a blingy new larger ship.
---
I'm in null because I like the lack of gate guns and I like bubbles, and the way I do earn my money to pvp with is in null. Also anomalies are a really good place to catch targets, I've found it to be harder in lowsec
---
I only see stage 1 and 3, unless the little red parts on the triglavian symbols i circled are not representing the stage.
---
Imperial Legacy - 90k 
---
panfam - 25k 
---
Yes, NC. should reset PL/Horde to make eve more interesting
---
Lmao.
---
Question op.. Do you know what a meme is? Cuz eve is dying is a meme.. Yes somethings need fixing but buy and large the game is better now than before, baring a few glaring balance issues.
---
For example, researching a BPO at 0.10 index is 85m vs. 800m at 2.5 index.  This demonstrates how index scales.
---
A single person can easily raise a system index to 2.5, or even 6.0 with a couple of alts.
---
The typical spread between buy and sell orders is 3% ~ 5%, with anything more being an opportunity, or a scam.  I aim for at least 10% return on material investment, but typically earn more than that depending on the item.
---
One doesn't want to waste ISK on manufacturing costs.
---
Currently injectors get a penalty for total sp on the character, what about moving that to be for sp injected and then increasing the penalty. For example, after injecting 1.5m sp (3 injectors), each injector will now give only 80%, then 60% after 5m total sp injected and so on, with a rapidly decreasing amount of sp per injector the more you inject, this would make it cost much more to inject rorq/cap/super pilots but still give a large boost to newer players trying to catch up
---
I came here expecting nothing, and yet I somehow leave disappointed
---
thats a good and healthy idea too. sadly wont happen cause money money money
---
Yeah the site doesn't even exist anymore.
---
not really, one are would always be safer, the others would be farmed. 
---
After a while people would start to leave because of better space somewhere else
---
The game wasn't designed for people to be just exploring for 15 years. You aren't expected to be able to do one activity in eve for forever, even if that's the expectation, it's just unrealistic no matter the situation.
---
Now you get to move on to new activities, mining, pvp, manufacturing, trading, Corp management, asset collection, etc etc etc. You hit a dead end with one aspect of the game after YEARS. that's called life, not a failed game. Now I, the new player, will go play exploration, and from the sounds of it I'll get a few years of content, and then it will be time to move on. It's a game, not a perfect environment well all is always fun and never ending.
---
So many people have played the game for a decade or longer, thats TEN YEARS of content, and are now screaming the pot has run dry. Damn, it took over ten years? Well fucking played CCP, I haven't played any other game in the planet consistently for ten years
---
Inflation is negligible. See the consumer goods price index.
---
I feel like being a solo hunter any more has become rather difficult
---
surprised the caiman lived, maybe nobody noticed it?
---
I think you're lying.
---
There's also the fact that at least a handful of those "resources" are complete shit, Eve-Survival barely has content and it's outdated and just plain wrong in most cases.
---
Hold your horses. First of all, that was not my point. My point was that the way the game is played is in large part shaped by the ruleset of that game. Do you agree with this or not?
---
Your reply to my point was that people play the game in ways that wasn't originally expected by CCP, which is besides the point I was making. So what if CCP didn't expect people to live inside wormholes? That doesn't mean that the way people play isn't in part shaped by the ruleset, because living inside a wormhole is entirely within the ruleset of the game (and even brings a lot of benefits). You're not making any sense.
---
Then you reply to my post with this drivel:
---
&gt;Wants CCP to “fix” the sandbox
---
&gt;
---
&gt;also thinks CCP is too dumb to fix the sandbox
---
First of all, this was again not the point I was making - stop moving the goalposts. Second of all, how are those two statements mutually exclusive?? Wanting something to happen but realizing it probably won't ever happen doesn't suddenly take away the want. Like I am amazed that you would think this is somehow a clever comeback, when it's yet another dumb post by you. Do you just make dumb posts or are you actually dumb?
---
SHIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
---
I'm also a new bro, who just doesn't care about what they say and enjoy the game, right here.
---
theres not enough of them anymore, simple math ...
---
That’s my evening sorted :) hope I have a Jc in highsec left
---
I'm just sad that eve has reached the point where loss is so meaningless.

Subcap balance stopped being a thing when teleporting carriers/supers started one shotting them.
---
OK sure buddy, something something rules something.
---
What rules am I demanding? Name one "rule" that I have described. Where did I ever use the word rule? At what point did I say there were punishments or enforcers of this non existent rule I never spoke about?
---
And sure, report for spam.
---
If I could report for false accusations, like saying I'm imposing imaginary rules I've never once mentioned, I would opt to inform you otherwise, than shoot down the people trying to prevent the loss of new players to the game.
---
And nothing about that is pay to win.
---
Also, PVP is only a personal isk sink, not an economic isk sink. Bounties and mission rewards are the only economic isk faucets.
---
I like you

This and also before they can even sit in a rorq. It’s a slight skill detour, but with rorq boosts they can mine a substantial amount of ore in a barge and just dump it into the rorq (still easy to multibox). Which also allows for passive training along the way.
---
you must be so proud, - and, still fitting small hul repairer on your ships?!
---
_44 players_ 
---
Eve still not dead idiots.
---
For what it brings to the game, it should be as easy as ozone, (insert cyno ship name here), titan bridge/capital jump,  and random numbers. I agree it should be a more complex task to pull off for the power projection it brings.
---
&gt;everyone is ignoring this fact
---
I'm pointing out that my point is valid even if you ignore that fact, so yes, I'm still ignoring it, and my point is still valid. Congrats?
---
Naga is a pretty good example too
---
lol, should we tell him?
---
Big fights generated by rorqs wouldn't be affected by this, i think you misunderstand me here. I want rorquals to generate fights for gangs of all sizes, wether the rorq dies in the end or not. There are plenty of tools small gangs can use to kill rorqs even with fewer numbers, it's just that the current panic timer allows the defenders to form a 100% perfect counter all of the time. The attackers need to get (atleast some of) the element of surprise back on their side.
---
As for proper large fights in general i think it should be structures generating them not rorqs. In a war you don't hit the rorqs, you hit the structures that they dock at. Fix structure timers and you have a great way to generate fights. 
---
Rorqs in their current form are much better suited as content generator for roaming gangs/fleets.
---
yea what I mean now they have even less reason to listen to the players lol. they didn't do it for 10 years why now
---
You want an overpowered pipedream of a ship.
---
How original.
---
The kool aid in this thread is actually horrifying
---
tbh not expected any kind of balls from NC at this point.      
---
They managed to surprise me.
---
Galaxy, your opinion on this is extremely varied amongst the player base, I would love to agree with you but THE LOUDEST VOICE in eve online is screaming at new players that joining would be an exceptionally dumb thing to do. I understand it's a meme. It is hurtful to the game. Is this understood? The meme DOES NOT EXIST IN A VOID. The meme directly impacts the game negatively.
---
Inflation is not negligible over the last few years, look at the total amount of isk in game and how much it has risen in that time period.  Not to mention the total Consumer Goods Trade Value over time.
---
I was trying to be as generous as possible.
---
Lol just adapt idiot
---
Everyone wants to just sweep under the rug the fact that CCP enabled all these things to happen through shitty game mechanics. Small gang content being squashed because caps and supercaps have retarded application? People being lazy about being in space because of instant cyno and fax blob? Rorquals that completely imbalanced mineral acquisition? Citadels making hunting irrelevant when combined with instant local intel?  
---
Don't direct your angst and the people exploiting the system to the fullest degree. Direct your anger at the people who don't play the game who lack the foresight to see all their changes are ruining it, not making it better.
---
&gt; the game mechanics merely allowed for one group to own the entire mineral wealth of the game 
---
Isn't this pretty much Pseudo true now though? TEST+Imperium cannot be contested realistically anymore, if anyone starts anything close to resembling Delve you just deploy 1k titans and smash all their infrastructure and there's nothing they, or any other group can do.  Anyone who wants to do super production as a non-political entity will just join TEST or the Imperium anyway (like they currently do already).   
---
I highly doubt you would simply sit back and let another neutral group have industrial activity that rivals Delve. This is essentially the status of the current game. 
---
The current game is a massive chore to be an aggressor. There is almost no way for an underdog to be able to have a lasting impact on the map with Keepstars, 3 timers on citadels, and jump gates that you can't be followed through that are protected by non-interact-able chain doomsdays
---
No, they did not.
---
In 2009 people were mining in mining cruisers and haulers.
---
edit: just checked, you're right, they were out back then. Why did I never see them? and why did I mine in a mining cruiser?
---
Or they just don’t want to be in a group of colossal retards that takes anyone with a pulse like TEST?
---
Oh shit you got me!
---
Its almost like that is exactly what happened and wasn't a personal insult?!? 
---
It was so insulting I almost CURSED! /s
---
this is obviously an amras alt
---
Oh but it did!
---
IIRC there was some image after the World Arc video transmission that showed it alongside an Avatar and it was like the size of 5 Avatar's or something.
---
we don't want the servers to end, we want them to burn.
---
I mean, slyce 2as also a close ally of test and they never got kicked out. Maybe pl/NC always wanted tribute and didn't expect co2 to flip and try to retain it after the war
---
The one where doom got his pee pee twisted in a knot over getting rolled in provi and decided to throw pl supers in with winterco, tri, skillu, and a bunch of other small groups with the stated intent of making test homeless.  He and a few other morons also started going on referring to themselves as 'the meteor'.
---
something, something the mods can't change it iirc
---
I just went into system with it. It's pretty big, right enough.

If the rorqual dies in 3 minutes, the response fleet doesn't get there. No fight, no content. Rorquals don't need to be content for 5 man gangs. Just like a 5 man frigate gang doesn't need to be content for a 50 man fleet. Also, the statement that the panic timer allows defenders to form 100 % perfect counter all the time... you obviously know that's really incorrect and are speaking from perhaps a bad personal experience. Dozens and dozens of rorquals die every week with a panic module. The attackers to have an element of surprise, they dictate when and how the attack will begin. Removing rorquals from the field as something that can survive for more than 3 minutes would reduce large scale fights by a good bit. I'm suggesting that before that comes to pass, something else be put in place that reliably creates large scale escalations.
---
The fuck?
---
If you put Slaves, PGs and EHEs in they only kill 7 titans instead of 33. Thanks for pointing that out.
---
Because you're always going to believe exactly what you're going to believe. if you believe rote kapelle is a failure of an organization, nothing I'm going to say is going to change that. So why are you pretending like I can?
---
That's a funny way of copy/pasting an example.
---
Right, so probably a gazillion trillion billion bananas in size.
---
&gt; So many people have played the game for a decade or longer
---
It's not CCPs content that kept them in the game so long. And its not why I'm still here. The only thing they did was time based progression to keep you out of all available content for a bit longer.
---
Also [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types) exists for a reason. If people don't find enough content for their playstyle they will quit the game. Just because the game offers a total of 4 years of content doesn't mean everyone gets even half of that time out of it.
---
Thats a Hecate with ground effects
---
&gt; Which is zero.
---
Shame. People should be able to learn from their mistakes.
---
Where do you see this? I surf this sub daily and every time a thread asking if its a good time to join overwhelming majority say yes. So where is this opinion coming from? There are some toxic people out there that says shit but jesus thats everywhere.
---
Like nc needs a reason to fight goons
---
Fair enough.
---
Concord capital modules used to be meta but that was just a setup for the "why only t1 guns?" meme every time a titan died.
---
Thanks mate, 
---
you have very clearly indicated the issue brought up in this post does not affect you in any way, where as i have made it abundantly clear that it affects others greatly.
---
Acknowledging your own existence literally enhanced your argument by 0.0%
---
Players hoard isks. When they stop playing, these isks are as good as destroyed. Isks supposedly flooding the game are actually only compensating for this.
---
Consumer goods price index represent the value of the things players usually buy (ships, ammo etc.) this index is very stable over the years. There are fluctuations, but overall it's stable. There is no inflation. The price of a ship today on average is the same as it was some years ago.
---
Also a lot I mean A LOT of armchair dev is talked about and thats usually under the pretense eve is dying this thing needs to change. But honestly you seem like a snow flake did code touch you somewhere?
---
because init (and to a lesser extent goons) are pathological headshotting bastards and i don't want to die while anchoring a fleet without a backup sorted, which i never do for a flash form
---
not because i think i'm space important or recognizable by name

It’s both that are at fault, bluing everyone so you can pve safely to the detriment of your own PvP content is what we call... being a carebear, and alliance leadership is responsible for that
---
&gt;go fuck yourself m8
---
read between the lines. we're done here, you fucking smoothbrain
---
Obviously not
---
Not just the time commitment. You have less people to play with, less people to shoot and most targets require you to be able to kill at least a capital.
---
How exactly do you counter supercaps traveling through lowsec when they cap up and jump before the session timer expires?
---
Where is this two thirds number coming from? Losing 66% of your players is pretty extreme. Source? Or are you just talking out of your ass? 
---
The game definitely has declined some in the past few years but if they lost 2/3s of players then there must also be a shit to of new players coming in and keeping the boat afloat.
---
You wont find any rational thought on reddit bro... this is not a free speech forum, its controlled and moderated by the most bias groups in the game. You make a good observation
---
And the game rewards that kind of gameplay. Again, who should you be angry at? The people playing the game to their best ability (and succeeding, at that) or the people who made be a filthy spodbrained krab not only viable but the easiest and quickest way to succeed?
---
Rather have pirate T3Cs.
---
Pl never evicted test. The only group to do that is goons
---
This for tomorrow?
---
While this is mostly accurate and I am not intending to change the direction of your statement, I would point out that the initial iteration AND current mineral costs put it at around 500m an hour for the first few months per rorqual. The first nerf changed that to around 250m an hour. (both number sets for +10 variant ore anoms). That allowed for a tremendous initial surge and unspending in rorqual pilots being injected.
---
A bit of wanton destruction goes a long way to building character, don't you agree?
---
It's down to about 5 minutes max now I believe.
---
Even a simple yes or no question is too much for you, I understand. 
---
Life won't always be this difficult for you, it gets better.
---
I dont know what you are reading, but this is also blatantly false.
---
If you cant kill Mecha, thats really bad. He is literally the dumbest person i have ever heard on comms.
---
During a fleet out in null, he was completely perplexed why his Proteus was not great for a 100mn loki fleet. He complained constantly and got the boot.
---
He came back 2 months later, couldnt figure out how auth worked. He left saying he wasnt a spy and that he shouldnt have to auth to any group. He was in Shoot First like 2 seconds later.
---
I understand eve is a game where you play they way you want, but why even attempt to join alliances if all you are gonna do is smart bomb stuff in lowsec? Just make your own corp and become more famous with a cool corp name.
---
If i am ever around Ama/auga, ill hunt him and send you a KM

3 trillion destroyed so far in Vale and Tribute. Ha ha.

There's enough to fight back, and TAPI is an ally on convenience.

---
Lol sticking to the past script of talking points against us. Literally none of that is accurate rn
---
Laz, you have posted now in this thread more times than me I think. Do you need to go outside and get a little fresh air? Get a bite to eat? Do something, anything else but comment uselessly? 
---
How bout this, go play EVE and convince a Newbro that they should play eve for the next many years to come,
---
Boom, go be Positive influence, hwyaa! Run, go, be free.
---
Can I ask honestly, how long have you been playing and what are you currently up to?
---
Destroying something isn't the same as exploiting resources. The best we can hope for is to beat someone down and hope like hell they collapse on their own from the stress. We can't move in and absorb the resources they held into our own fold without abandoning our previous holdings.
---
You're also severely overestimating our capacity for destruction. We've had two successful deployments since we were evicted from the north in 2016. (The current northern campaign, and the previous northern campaign culminating in X47 and the final death of CO2.) That's two deployments in three years. Taking such an elderly timetable for destruction to mean that no one in the game can do anything any more is a personal problem. If we had thought that way, we would never have been able to recover from 2016. The parallels here are quite striking, yet we see dogged perseverance from ourselves and flaccid complaints from without.
---
That's called a second job.
---
You realize nobody thinks the rorq itself is overpowered...
---
Its the panic module that is broken.
---
You called World War Bee the "casino war" wtf?
---
Make it a CovOps cap killer.
---
Are covert cynos immune to jammers?  ( I don't know these big alliance thingies.)
---
Just downvote and enjoy the explosions mate
---
Thank you echo, they are exceptionally good at starting fires and I hope that I didn't burn anyone via collateral damage.
---
Literally, I could get less hate for posting a story about why every one should just give up and quit eve. Seriously.
---
Having never been in Goons or NC/PL here is my somewhat objective take 
---
1. NC/PL used supers/titans to dick over tons of small entities and there was never any counter to them (I was in Brave 2014...), they were unbeatable op as fuck ships and NC/PL felt elite using them even they were never in a position to really lose any of them as the game mechanics heavily favored their use. 
---
2. Goons recognize that Supers/Titans were unbeatable op as fuck and built more of them to kill NC/PL
---
3. It has never been about who is a better player, more capable, better tactics when it comes to Supers and Titans it is 90% who has more. 
---
4. Supers/Titans in their current iteration are bad for the health of the game, it doesn't matter that NC/PL abused them for years and now its Goons turn. Subcaps which are inherently more player skill intensive, cheaper to procure and lose, and provide better daily content are completely oppressed by super/titan usage in eve warfare.
---
Part of the "thrill" of the fight is the possibility of loss.  Is just ISK loss enough?  
---
I'm not suggesting it is, only that something important is being lost from the game over time.  Vet status (injectors), Plex (earning ISK), SP loss... there's less at stake these days than there used to be back when the game was a few years old.  
---
I'm quite nostalgic for it.  Those of you who don't remember it won't understand!
---
Not you specific but lowsec in general.
---
I'd like to see lowsec thrive with the next CSM but lowsecers need to get on the same page
---
Comments like that are either people with many account upvoting or groups of people being told to upvote said comments. I wouldn't focus on the upvotes but the players response to the questions.
---
Bitter vets gonna be bitter vets.
---
I hear you mate, but you, I, and every one knows the most common phrase in any conversation picked at random about eve will be loaded with stuff that discourages new players
---
I am not NC. nor in any big alliance and I also downvoted you for being an ass.
---
Behold our wise dispenser of Truths. We shall not see it before you enlighten us.
---
What took you so long?
---
No.
---
It's the Wild wild Delve, you bring content to our collosals we don't need to go anywhere.
---
What you need to do is stop posting.
---
yes, but you replaced skill with numbers.
---
k, what does it do?
---
&gt;  Do you need to go outside and get a little fresh air?
---
I do actually, but have another like 16 minutes on the clock today at work. Do not worry i am not wasting my own time here, i am wasting my employer's time, always. 
---
&gt; How bout this, go play EVE and convince a Newbro that they should play eve for the next many years to come,
---
But why should i do that, my friend? It is your goal to keep EVE alive and get newbros in. My goal is to survive next 15 minutes so i can finally fuck off work for today. And so i am having a bit of fun here on reddit. 
---
&gt; Boom, go be Positive influence, hwyaa! Run, go, be free.
---
Sorry my man, no can do. It would go against my best judgement. I want the world to burn. Ehm, burn more than it does now.
---
You're really on a string of great comments these days, aren't you?
---
Damn Right
---
Nothing specific, but a good starting point to look at would be any Amarrian hulls that are NOT bonused towards armor resists (i.e. avoid the Punisher, Maller, Abaddon, etc).
---
Amarr ships typically don't have a lot of mid slots, which translates to typically not having the slots for shield tank.
---
You can't deploy them at all in lowsec.
---
&gt; Everyone on r/Eve decides to participate in the riot.
---
&gt; Player count drops from 28000 to 27940.
---
First, I imagine CCP managers being like "wait so they are paying for a service and in protest rather than stop paying they are just not using our service ? Awesome".
---
Second, what exactly are you protesting about ?
---
&gt; We don't randomly turn on our blues on some flimsy excuse 
---
Out Of The Loop: What's happening?
---
The players who gave a shit about the game and participated in the Jita riots are long gone man. Just the turbo krabs remain.
---
The citadel spam was poorly thought of. I still don't understand why there isn't an upper limit of citadels in each system. This automatically generates an opportunity for attackers. Nope, instead we have 20+ astras in systems. Atleast with the old POS system there was a reason to rf.
---
How do we convince bots to log off? There are many more them then us currently....
---
Scouts along the jump routes like everyone else did
---
Because that 30 sec delay on tethering made it so much harder to catch supers and titans moving!
---
Whoa black betty PandaFam
---
You really don't realize how small brave was back then do you. That was our only fortizar in that system and we didn't own a keepstar. And PL dropped several Astrahus' in that system, not next door. Get the facts straight first
---
I'm already protesting :D
---
Higher class t3 too. The hint of destroyer t3 was nice..!
---
I imagine that's its propably a realistic number, most players online are just alts, plus alpha keeping numbers up and the daily count is still much lower than it was l. Like it or not the player base has heavily diminished.
---
Your longevity in this game doesn't make you better than anyone. It just makes you more bitter
---
By the time everyone unsubs it will be too late. We need to shock them now. I did not add a list of demands because that would simply be something for everyone to argue about.
---
Just because rorquals with the current panic module die doesn't mean that there is nothing wrong with them. There is no correlation there. And i'm not speaking from a bad experience, i just don't think in such a static way about it.
---
Obviously a rorq will die quickly when 150 bombers start shooting it. So does any other capital ship. But a gang of that size rarely goes unnoticed on intel channels. Even if you cyno the bombers in/use a wormhole the rorq still has panic + a bigger tank than other capitals to fend for itself until the response comes. And this is still excluding the FAXs that start streaming in as soon as a rorq lites it's cyno.
---
I don't know why you are so adamant that rorqs are not supposed to be content for smallgangs, every single ship in the game can be killed by 5 man gangs, why should rorquals be the absolute exception to that. It takes for absolutely fucking ever to break a rorq with such few people, if you can't get help in *that* timeframe you fucked up badly. Nevermind the drone bay, neuts and shield emitters that you can slap on a rorq. but it's a capital ship yadda yadda
---
Nobody is that fast all the time
---
it's the trigavian big boss man
---
&gt; benign neglect
---
What, specifically, are you whining about?
---
It’s honestly a complete waste of your time and sanity to continue to post here expecting anything to change.  Be the change you wanna see.
---
By this logic, we can be countered because we can be scouted and caught.
---
&gt;Didn't happen
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
Why not just bring combat probes and a viator alt to tag along and collect a hundred drones in every system when they warp to safe
---
I love you!
---
Lmfao, nah it's still the fault of the coalitions bluing everything in sight since its detrimental to the game and has pretty much killed content across the board. Pretty tired of this "The game makes us do it!!!" narrative. If the coalitions want a shit game where nothing really happens and all they do is mine in peace while having 'skirmishes' that's their doing, not CCP putting a gun to their heads and making them shit up the game.
---
 Also"Hurr durr caps bad!!! &gt;:(" lmao
---
Yo caps, especially fighters havent applied well to anything moving at a somewhat decent pace for like 2 years now
---
Anyways, cool post bud
---
Soooo not playing and then dozen of reddit threads about why we're not playing ? Sounds like what half this subreddit is already doing.
---
WOW I was enjoying one of the more legitimate conversations in this thread until you dropped "snowflake". Holy shit was that a stupid thing to do.  I'm actually taken aback at how incredibly unintelligent that was. And then you made a joke about molestation? All while in the middle of an mature grounded conversation.
---
At least you did it anonymously and none of your friends or family will see it. Please do not use that tactic on social media for your own sake.
---
&gt; The game isn't trash - your personalities are.
---
Welcome to your true family, bro.
---
Good plan, in anticipation, I stopped logging in months ago.
---
3h/day for a hobby ain't that much.
---
If every single ship in the game can be killed by a 5 man gang, what's the hang up with one ship being something other than 5 man content that lives long enough to require escalation? Some people, a lot of people, like escalations and big knock out fights.
---
Dude are you fucking retarded or what? Whether or not theyre disbanded has nothing to do witg that they are **RENTERS** - they A) tend not to join combat B) are tenants of PvP groups, not PvPers - whether theyre disbanded or not has **nothing to do** with what I said, Turn your brain on, **RENTERS DO NOT DROP SUPERS IN COMBAT** so why the fuck were they counted? You need to get off your fucking high horse you condescending moronic peice of shit
---
Honestly the whole game discourages new players that dont pay the sub. Ccp has no idea what a new player experience is. But I can tell you its 100% better and easier onboarding Now than when I did in 2012.
---
Just because its discouraging dosent mean it isnt rewarding. Eve is hard.. Deal with it it wasnt made with ease on mind it isnt ment to be easy. The only thing I can tell you trying to do any capital stuff as a new player is hilarious and the credit card worriors usually die the fastest they have no idea the complexity of fitting amd piloting. Eve is massive and just as much so deep. The only phase goes harden the fuck up.

I started 5 years ago, and sporadically played 2-3 times over the 5 years for just a month or so each time. I have come back to the game officially and ready to invest and commit 100%.
---
I am a member of pandemic and live in nullsec. I pvp, explore, and mine occasionally, I love doing a variety of things, but generally right now I'm trying to learn more about working in a fleet.
---
I’m pretty sure NC is already doing this.
---
Good point. What a well-thought-out argument.
---
Cool, the rest of the triglav invasion has been disappointing as fuck, maybe this will be decent.
---
And yet they seem to settle for being in a smaller group of retards.
---
Precursor ships were hinted at in a pre Eve Gate collapse artwork. They looked like fatigued Rorquals, with large tanks on their sides, presumably storage, or cargo areas/containers, maybe hab-units in the early, early days of the New Eden, perhaps earlier than capsule history is willing to redoubt. 
---
If any precursor race is available, it might he questionable that they had created vessels different materially from extant races, though a vamped model of the original carrier ships of New Eden might be enough of a sentimental trip to the Empires that it would merit consideration, even to jaded empyrean capsule Fleet Command.
---
Noone on r/eve ever logs into the game anyway lmao
---
Burn Jita YCwhatever year it is I can't fuckin keep track
---
You can still be pro-PvE while being 100% against botting....
---
Keres.
---
5 hours a day is a lot of time to put into something. That is a lot of work. If you spent 5 hours a day at the gym or 5 hours a day at work, that's a lot of commitment. Playing a game that much is the same thing, even if you enjoy it.
---
I use  Eve-Survival to run lv 3 and 4 missions and it works pretty well...
---
There is an up-to-date survival list?
---
Sure you could. Ore sites have only recently been kneecapped to have a meaningful respawn. With sufficient manpower, and crucially, a culture that didn't instinctively and decisively take amoebic dysentery shits all over anyone who committed even the precrime of thinking about mining, one could extract far more ore per day from a single system than they did today. CCP's done quite a bit to reduce density in this regard.
---
 "Bring eve's signature gameplay elements to mobile"  -Hilmar  at E3

This is what I mean, does he seriously think that is the most important thing to talk about?
---
Good, fucking eat it, that banana is ripe to go
---
You must be awful at the game. Pre-select your docking station when you start an anom. See hostile in local, hit the align button, keyboard command to turn off ab, keyboard command to pull drones. Takes about a second to do per account. Hover over the warp button while drones fly back. It's not hard to do, no bot required.
---
Oh my, your at work?! Hold on let me go on break before I respond, oh wait I don't need to, nor do I need to explain to people the reasons why I'm actually lurking in this subreddit, and when I get called out for lurking this sub reddit, I'll claim Im at work and it don't matter. Hey bro, no one is getting paid to be here. Most of us are probably at work. You are not making you look any better by going out of your way explaining your situation that no one asked for. I simply asked if you had better things to do like going outside, clearly you do since your apparently at work, which absolutely no one cares, so why don't you go so that.
---
[Here](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/) seems to be decent, at least has more content covered.
---
they are less stronger that they used to be :/
---
Just add Doomsdays and cap guns to T3c
---
I wonder if CCP will ever apply the Dev time and give straight answers to what they are doing to fix the problem.
---
So far it's pve events that are underwhelming and have zero actual effect on actual space.
---
At what point is the game just not profitable anymore

PL 2016: lol shoulda built more supercapitals, nerds

nice, more empety systems for me to run combat sites in then

As a new player who started this week... what’s going on?  Am I screwed?
---
&gt;You keep rolling and rolling wormholes and apart from the mega blobs with super umbrellas there isn't much to shoot at anymore. And it is not just the summer this time.
---
This right here is the real problem that ccp has been dancing around for years. Capital ships are OP... theyre afraid of hampering them in any real amount bc people are invested in them... they are proliferating like crazy... and whenever they drop on grid, they invalidate subcaps.
---
Lots of really large changes need to be made to change it so that caps are net negative (more losses than produced) for awhile to thin out the proliferation, but one quick easy fix to make the game more fun is to make it harder to engage a gang with a capital ship.
---
why do you still bother to argue with these absolute autists on reddit?
---
Barwey, I am literally trying to be the change, spreading the message of not discouraging new bros. D:
---
Thank you for your response though, I appreciate I really appreciate more serious responses
---
Apparently they do, because they haven’t been.
---
Don't be sheep for CCP, be sheep for me. Also, I believe that in my writing ability and think this will come across like a strongly worded missive read in the voice of V for Vendetta.
---
I've been thinking about something like this for a couple weeks now. Something like a Corvette Combat League, so cool to see this already happen. Will see if I can join in !
---
Do you dislike fighting? Because that's what you're saying nobody should do.
---
Nu Pure Blind &amp; the Cure "Coalitions" aren't a thing anymore.
---
LOL! Ok...you got me.
---
You care too much about some these shitpost and other whinings, just play the game. That's all I say man.
---
It's not. It's supposed to explain that pl did in fact evict, not "move in next door." I don't want sympathy for it, people get evicted all the time. But PL can't be upset that a blue donut formed from all the people they've fucked over.
---
Who specifically, I think stitch was a great candidate for lowsec, I think cormak was also a popular choice.
---
Not sure honestly..
---
Not logging in atm anyway, so im good.
---
Yea let's tell all the new players coming to the outrageously steep and difficult learning curve that is eve just to "harden the fuck up". That's so encouraging! Why didn't I think of that? No one will immediately run at the first sign of that kind of disregard for new players, none, problem solved.
---
Big /s in that one
---
Oh the irony. Dropping those two Astra's on the CCP-US gate, and your titans and superfleet from P-33 into DOG-HQ, should have been it. Final victory over the wretched newbs. But it sent Brave right onto a couch run by a cool dude named Sapporo,  like they once crashed on ours.
---
Everything you did has only lead to HERO 2.0., and while others at least joined in with Frat. last year and gave it a last whirl, you just shittalked your own alliance and left when things got hard. I prefer our legacy.
---
I don't quite understand how you don't see it.  I'll use myself as an example.  I buy PLEX to supplement my ISK income.  I buy PLEX and sell it for ISK on the market for the exclusive purpose of ship replacement.  I buy the ships off the market.  
---
Therefore:
---
I don't mine for minerals to build ships.
---
I don't do any industrial at all to build ships.
---
This means:
---
I don't have to wait for anyone or anything to replace my losses.  I can literally lose a 5b ISK ship, and replace it in 5-10 minutes by buying PLEX, sell the PLEX for ISK, and purchase the ship and modules off the EVE market using the ISK I received for the PLEX.
---
Meanwhile you have to either 
---
A.  Go back to PVE to save 5B ISK, which will take you a few days or weeks.
---
B.  Mine for minerals, and then bake a ship, which will take mining and manufacturing time.
---
Meanwhile I'm taking your space because you can't keep up with my ability to replace my ships.  
---
Why? Because I'm buying PLEX for the sole purpose of exchanging it for ISK so that I can find my PVP, while your using the convention in-game PVE or industrial mechanics to generate ISK.
---
For the record I do this.  I have a single credit card I use and pay off monthly for this activity.  I generate BILLIONS of ISK a month without touching the PVE/mining/industry aspects of the game.  Attrition for me is defined on how much RL$ I'm willing to spend.  I can keep going as long as I'm having fun, and I'm having alot of fun - paying to win.  It's not about whether my PLEX/ISK nets me killmails.  It's me being able it sustain my play indefinitely longer than you because your too busy mining your minerals or cooking your ships.
---
He's a complete fucking idiot, yes.
---
So... the original Naglfar was a boat made entirely from the fingernails and toenails of the dead.
---
IMO Eve doesn't need any more new ships, it needs to focus put on core game mechanics e.g. Sov, Citadels, FW.   Let the art team(s) focus on updating the ship models :)
---
My biggest problem with your equation is it doesn't factor prenerfs. Also, majority of the cost you are factoring can easily be reduce by having someone in null to build it. Lastly, most people pay to get their ore hauled to a trade hub. its more profitable than a 85% buyback of the buy order in a trade hub. factor that in and you will get significantly low numbers. Did you factor that excavators are 500mil now?
---
It's 464286 bananas wide:
---
1. The standard length of a banana is 14 cm according to European trade regulations.
---
2. An Avatar is 13km in length, which is roughly 92858 (actually 92.857,14285714286‬) bananas in length.
---
3. multiplied by 5, you get 464286 (rounded up 464285,7142857143).
---
I thought eve was primarily played by adults? Today, I have clearly learned DeFiNatLy NoT!
---
I’m just trying to understand what you are after.  Is this thing just because they are working on mobile?   Or is there something else you are mad about.
---
Don’t worry they hav eve mobile. U can eat on your phone. Or did this not happen yet?
---
Eve is EXTREMELY welcoming to new players, as evidenced by the existence of organizations like Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, Karmafleet, Eve-Uni, RvB, and others.  We all went through the obscene learning curve of this game and generally want to help new players have it easier than we did.
---
The one class of new player we **won't** help is the one that thinks they know it all already, that thinks they're special and already wants to tell everyone else how to think, play, and feel about the game.  Stop being that guy and you'll find a much nicer community.  We've got a lot of good reasons for feeling the way we do, even if they're not apparent to you as a new player, and you wagging your finger in our face about it is not going to make you many friends.
---
No, and no. I dislike a massive blue donut but moreso I dislike ncpl bitching about a blue donut that they had a big part in creating.
---
are you completely forgetting the major difference in game mechanics re: the mobility of a capital fleet from way back when?
---
NICE, I got you to write out an exit speech!
---
I want even trying..
---
WELL PLAYED!
---
This comment could be literally from any time in the last at least 6 years.
---
Its been repeatedly a point of discussion for at least 3-4 years
---
The Pith-X SB, the republic fleet cap bat and the gecko(at least one).  
---
It's all the pimp you realy need. I did relic sites in C3 and regular anoms in C3/C4 with a 800M actif snake. isk was between 200M and 300M/h (magnetar needed to reach the 300M)  
---
Maybe I could do more with more pimp but I don't think it worth it.
---
I guess you are upset too. I guess you are sad that the toy you mined for get's dusty in kqk...
---
Can't log out if I don't log in.
---
That's still, by definition, not pay to win.
---
Anyone you're going up against could replace their losses just as readily while not spending real money.
---
The only thing that's "pay to win" is the Omega clone over Alpha clone.
---
Isn't the imicus beautiful :\^))))
---
I work on the 24th so can we plan it for the 25th instead?
---
lol now rectify how citadel damage caps are allowed to nullify infinite amounts  of damage
---
maybe don't write what you can't stand behind
---
I think you mean total active coalition CHARACTERS, not players.
---
For example, Goons has roughly 1/3 the number of real players compared to the number of characters you stated. I imagine other alliances are somewhat similar.
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
Okay and guess what will happen when not init and goons are with you.... exactly we would get blueballed. This is eve these days...
---
Sure the isk/hr per rorqual isnt great. But they can scale, and unless you are a vegetable they are nearly impossible to lose.
---
you've hit the nail on the head. the problem isn't the auto targeting, its the fact that the content itself is so trivial. The best way to nerf bots is to make the problem space they have to deal with much more complex. You don't see bots doing relic/data sites because scanning and the mini-game is dramatically more complex. EVE is also super easy to OCR because data is so structured. The overview is both EVE's greatest tool, and greatest curse.
---
Why do people keep bringing up small alliances?  There are no small alliances involved in this at all.
---
SLYCE was not a close ally of TEST during the Tribute War? What are you talking about? They were in GOTG and were the only GOTG alliance to stay neutral, didn't shoot either side.
---
Totally. Welcome to EvE (Everyone versus Everything) Online. For clarification, you were screwed the moment you logged on. I mean, EvE is an awesome game, but you still get that feeling. By the way, what brought you to the game? (I enjoy asking new players this)
---
Thats why eve is so small. Its like the dark souls of MMOs but in space.
---
Its not good marketing for anyone but whos already interested in that mentality. More of the vets hate how easy the game has become. Ccp balances for fleet pvp not pve and the pve content hasnt been adjusted to match in literally years I could probably say a decade in some cases. Ccp is to small to manage what they have in any real capacity so they need us to voice what Really needs to change. And talking about it helps, I recent posted a cmv style thing on rorquals and if theyre broken or not. Turns out they take a bit more attention then they seem to the naked eye so theyre probably fine. Panic is still a hot button but the Hull is fine.
---
[Yes.](https://i.imgur.com/jVQKUiX.png)
---
&gt;Small gang content being squashed because caps and supercaps have retarded application? People being lazy about being in space because of instant cyno and fax blob? Rorquals that completely imbalanced mineral acquisition? Citadels making hunting irrelevant when combined with instant local intel?
---
This right here. Its the uncomfortable truth. Bc to help the game the caps/supers everyone has so heavily invested in needs to be toned back considerably.
---
I do not want to get into a laundry  list of things wrong with the game, because that will devolve into a squabble over whether this or that belongs on the list and the relative importance of each. If the want to know what players think is wrong they can read reddit, their own forums. or listen to the CSM who will give them an earful.
---
 The important thing is to shock them out of the notion that they can do nothing and get away with it.
---
AuToCoRrEcT hAs No PoWeR iN tHe aLtErNaTiNg CaPs DiMeNsIoN
---
Who has called ccp?
---
Huh, I still read reddit. I quit Eve 6 months ago. These posts don’t make me want to come back. I’m still subbed here because I’m waiting for posts that gifs me a lil hope for the game.
---
Oof if true
---
Found Hilmar’s Reddit alt
---
Holy shit this thread is a salt mine. As a new player you have already mastered the /r/eve meta.
---
Erm, can I remind you of botting carriers and supers?
---
I'm looking to not just play the game this week, but next week also, and many many many weeks/years into the future.
---
That will only happen if we not only bring in new players, but keep them here once they join.
---
Thank you for expressing your opinion in this thread, and hey, maybe I'll see you in space.
---
They had over double our numbers and as you can see I die to rats.
---
Without a clear goal a protest such as this is just a waste of everyone’s time.   
---
Let’s say someone at CCP actually says “what can we do to fix this?”  Then they get 1,000 diffferent answers, a number of which will be contradictory and/or confusing.  What then?
---
Goons had more titans for years than NCPL, they never had the balls to use them though. There's a reason why no-one wanted to fight CFC until pretty much all of eve was willing to.
---
Not really tbh, you can already have it by running a link alt with a vigi and the tracking would make up for the web range.
---
Hum, sidenote here, but it would probably be quite interesting if CCP were to change the bounty system to work similar to how you set up your bounty.
---
Bounty on a specific pilot in a specific ship, sounds a lot better than just placing a bounty on the pilot itself which always sounded pointless to me considering that clones are.. well, imortal. Idk i think the way you placed this kill contract to be so much more interesting, kinda wish CCP would attempt to introduce a system like that to the bounty system in the game.
---
Not when there are structures in place with 2 reinforcement timers set by the defender and each timer cannot be finished any faster than 30 minutes?
---
You could at least trap a moving cap fleet in a pos and nuke their safe space to intercept 
---
Nowadays, you just get to watch as they (much more) slowly move towards you
---
They already did. You should see the release notes from a few months ago.
---
Everything you've posted today screams "I want sympathy!"  that tapi victim complex is strong with the brave as well.
---
Should get rid of skills and make everyone the same. Free to play with pay to win added (trig ships). 
---
Game resets every year.
---
Systems and regions mix up to create different pipes and regions and different systems.
---
Citadels cant live longer then 2 days if under siege. 
---
Game should be semi fast paced
---
If I go get screenshots of that, the immediate reaction is gonna be "well prove what they were posting" since the GM mails don't say that. Believe him or not, nobody cares, it happened lmao
---
 You assume that you can ever have enough rorqual pilots :)
---
Your intention is good but you are so clearly incorrect. I said bad mentalities hurt player counts. I don't need 1000 hours in EVE to know this. I have played thousands of games over 25 years. I am not a child, and this is not my first rodeo. Bringing a better mentality to the game does not take a pro EVE player, it takes a better game period.
---
And again, people, read the post, it says very clearly that balance issues and changes are not the topic, critcize CCP all you want, but UNDERSTAND the implications it has on me players where your mentality of the game is so excessively negative.
---
"The top post is talking about how they killed someone"
---
"We are in r/eve"
---
Explo bots. They do exist.
---
Hoping people will play Eve the way you want when CCP refuses to change the shit meta is a losing battle friend 😔
---
Lol no one willing stays in brave/legacy if they don't like the blue donut
---
We're like 1300 dudes, come and dumpster us
---
Honour.... we are talking about eve right?
---
C0F1S #1
---
yes. Fatigue was a direct NCPL nerf, guess who wanted it most?
---
The goal is to shake them out of their complacency.
---
Brave going toe to toe with PL was a sight to behold, I was incredibly proud of them for that. The fact that in many fights they were coming out isk positive despite high losses was great. Towards the end, they went up against the full PL supercap fleet, killing a titan and started working on others before NC came to the rescue.
---
My feelings, you crushed them. Whatever shall I do?!
---
maybe stop only f1ing and try to learn stuff about eve
---
So, if you have money to buy a Marshal, then sit on a gate and smartbomb corvettes and frigates you end up being a "very good" pilot. Then claim being uncatchable because he can cyno out whenever he feels. I don't really understand Eve anymore.
---
Nice try Hilmar
---
You have a point :)
---
It wasn't even the caps vs T1 frigs, it was that fucking annoying TFI+triage doctrine that would mean 200 pantheon carriers and maybe supers if we tried to actually break it and drop caps
---
Are there any bounty hunter brokers?
---
Booo Eve is dead. Booo ccp, need to make changes, booo ccp you had 6 month tops to makes changes or Eve is dead...
---
Man. All that shit is getting boring already.
---
Hm... Is that the zero i know from E-uni/ponywaffe ?

Don’t sleep on Echo

Underrated comment.

That is at least 2 football fields

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Pictures or it didnt happen...oh wait...damnit
---
Frankly, no: I own a doctrine T3C Logi (obviously a Loki because there is no other T3) those things are powerful as hell and need a countervailing factor to offset the fact that my loki can be fit for 100k ehp, more reps then a scimi, a link and covops cloak simultaneously. They do eventually get alpha'd through by munins but if that matters you are taking the wrong fight. Retraining a subsystem skill isn't bad at all if you accept lvl IV and even lvl V is under a week.  
---
;) really what they should do is add SP loss to caps, lose a carrier and you lose a level of JDC or something /s
---
[And what if the bananas are mashed? How many then?](https://i.redd.it/3khojng6hxe01.png)
---
I agree. Null never really did it for me.
---
But how are we supposed to be angry at an alliance that's not in power if you're making good points? GRRRRR past superpowers!
---
Imagine replying to a post with a completely irrelevant response.
---
Boo, scary, boo, rorquals mine lots. Take your own advice, idiot.
---
New player? Stay off Reddit.
---
public contracts would just be completed by alts of the target. like the old days where you could cash out your total bounty with a single kill with your alt.
---
seems like a fun idea, but completely unimplementable.
---
lmao rorquals isn't the problem
---
"In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers". (Wikipedia.org, Free-to-play).
---
So you feel that my ability to buy PLEX, sell it for ISK doesn't provide me a gameplay advantage?
---
Let's say we have negative wallets.  We both have 5 ships. We PVP 5 games you beat we both are down to our last ship.  In the final round, you beat me.  You have 1 ship left.  I buy PLEX, sell it, make a positive wallet and buy 5 more ships, come back, pop your last ship.
---
What do you do?  You don't have the money to buy PLEX. How do you replace your ship.  Meanwhile why you figure it out, I'm going to blow up your personal maintenance bay you anchored in space.  I still have 5 ships to lose.
---
That's not pay-to-win?  You don't see my buying PLEX for ISK as an advantage over you lack of money to buy PLEX too - which is costing you additional property loss (including all your saved farmed biomass)  stored in your personal maintenance hanger.
---
Yes mate I was in E-Uni, though I was not in PonyWaffe (I went to Shiva :) ).
---
Nah. I'm upset that Friends of mine were on their own shit in middle of nowhere and NCPL droped 10 times on them until they left. Same could Say about groups like UnSpoken or JaG. Where NC almost droped on them more dreds than members they had...
---
You bullied over them. Was fun. Now people is rolling over you, enjoy.
---
No, we didn't. We had to rely on Sort Dragon and Russians to win B-R5, remember?
---
Because CCP have the players the infrastructure and said "do what you want" and now the players are upset that CCP isn't making the game fun for them. 
---
What do you want? 
---
CCP to dictate gameplay? 
---
Players to dictate gameplay?
---
Thanks for the math. Did you assume an ideal for or a complete shitfit when you made the calculations?
---
yeah awful idea, it will get abused so much, like transferring botting isk to someone you don't like.
---
Imagine.
---
Lmao - salt. I would love to have an articulate debate regarding mentalities developed in and around video games that span countries, decades, and breathes of knowledge, and their influences, 
---
But you no, let's keep repeating the word "salt".
---
Thanks.
---
And in the past, you could cap up completely before your session timer elapsed, allowing you to jump before you could be hic pointed. Your bellyaching about citadels isn't actually refuting my point. The apex force of yesteryear was even less able to be meaningfully engaged due to game mechanics.
---
Some people are frustrated, but many of them also are exactly what they hate. They choose to get caught up in stuff they don't find fun and ignore where all the fun is happening.
---
Yeee goons who are in tribute
---
BOYCOTT EVE FOR... REASONS
---
Oh, I'm sorry, where do I apply for my reddit license?
---
sounds like you'll fit right in then.
---
I'm not really invested in how *other people* play EVE. 
---
It just annoys me when they bitch and complain about the state of the game when they are sitting in massive player created organizations that actively try to reduce content by creating home areas that are safer than high sec.
---
Cap skill V are fucking long :D
---
I was in BRAVE when PL hell camped them in GE- and evicted them. Supers on the station undock and about 100 anchored bubbles covering the station so you couldn't get out with pretty much anything and just insta-popped. Lumpymayo states that he went through the activity log of newbros in BRAVE and literally THOUSANDS of players just logged off and never played again in GE-... Thousands of players quit the game bubble fucked in a station in GE-. That honestly makes me sad to think about.
---
IDK, that incident with the illegal fort in catch almost kicked off world war 3.
---
So you can only 'Control' space if you have a Keepstar?
---
Forward placed Astrahus' = Endgame eviction.
---
I am also from a very small alliance, the last time someone came knocking down our toy houses, we actively attempted to do harm to the attacking forces.
---
I treat brave with very high regard, I think they're a great and fiery group, your portrayal of them, or your representation of them makes them sound like a whiny high sec mining corp. My umbridge is with you as I think you're miss-representing their character.
---
What year was this? perhaps we could look at alliance numbers and stick your point?
---
a fixed ceiling on anything from downtime-downtime inherently favors EU/RU timezones who can farm out all the content before USTZ even has a chance to log in. or the cap is so high that its irrelevant.   
---
I do agree there needs to be some kind of negative for overfarming a region so that you can't support 30,000 pilots in a single region, but DT-DT doesn't work.
---
Sweet BR and AAR.
---
Yes
---
I think that's something I'm desperatly trying to demonstrate. They are what they hate. They discourage new players and then turn around and hate the lower player count.
---
If one quarter of the "EVE is dead posts" are EVE is alive and strong posts, the player count would reflect it.
---
I mean. The name kick ass. Thats for sure.
---
CCP about to pull a WOW Cataclysmic and level new eden. Then release Eve 2: Mobile Empires
---
Is this content?
---
There is one small advantage; cost. The specialization skillbooks for Triglavian weapons are off the walls expensive, prohibitively so for many people.
---
How many of those are bots?
---
Confirmed fake. You can always tell the goony knee bender when they call it the Casino War.
---
Then what is? It's not supercap umbrellas -- those have been keeping space safe since there was space. It's not ore anomaly spawning mechanics -- that's been in the game since 2009. I'm coming up blank, here.
---
Get too many bots banned in your alliance, sov drops.
---
You'll note that I did say that bots aren't the sole problem here. Yes of course they are an issue but anything a player can do, a bot can do too. The only thing it can't do is think. That's where the risk factor comes in. Even then, a bit can have threat levels built on, etc. You'll never beat the best bots because they can be better at this game than any of us.
---
However, by making it harder, and removing the easy isk faucets, it reduces the inflationary pressures on people who actually actively play the game. The better the bot, the more expensive it is to get it and maintain it and therefore there's likely to be fewer different bots in the market and hopefully a chance of catching a quirk in the code that allows a mass banning
---
One of my best times in Eve was when Privateer Alliance declared war on practically every alliance in Eve.
---
now we just need to revert nullsov to Great War 1 levels. and finally have a real war
---
Is this the new meta?
---
Wow you're really taking this a bit seriously aren't you.
---
and im over here with a life goal to lose a titan someday
---
yes exactly, catch in 2013 was an incredibly fun place. PKs titan exploding was the high point of that conflict. Also iirc brave survived a morale post by Elise at that time, so they can survive anything thrown at them, heh.
---
I’ve been playing off and on since 2004 and every time I’ve resubbed this has been asked for
---
&gt; T2 disintegrators can be easily fitted as this is just one gun per ship 
---
One gun which uses a shit ton of powergrid. There's big differences between a compact and a t2. They can be good fitting decisions. Also, they're cheap.
---
&gt;Meta disintegrators cannot use T2 ammo
---
As for all guns
---
&gt;Building Meta Disintegrator is more costly than T1 module (T1 can be upgraded to T2 or reprocessed to recover trigalavian mats, while META gives noting back) 
---
Same for all cap guns.
---
Meta disintegrators are working exactly as intended. Do you use meta guns regularly? They fit as designed. Cheap, low skills, need compact, etc. And TBH with the mystic tracking nerfs losing out on t2 ammo isn't the worst thing for a kiting triglav if it helps you stay cheap or get other things in with the PG.
---
Don't forget goons also invaded provi not long after fozziesov was introduced.
---
its sad, I have been playing as an alpha for about a year since i started  new job. usually play a few times a month. 
---
the login bonus convinced me to plex 4 accounts. i thought i'd have some fun playing as omega for a change. i think i logged in two days. i think I've finally won eve :(
---
Reading this thread and the comments is like watching the Flat Earth guy that was in Jita a while back. It's hard to tell whether he actually believes every word he says or if he's just trying to jolly people's jellies, or rile them up and push their buttons if you will. Its actually quite entertaining lol. Good show
---
who wanted the nerf doesn't change the fact that game mechanics favoured the blob in each circumstance
---
Uh. Check out the first ever Revenant kill.
---
Only gonna log in to update orders 5 times that day. That'll show em.
---
&gt; "In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers".
---
And here there is none. Name one item, ability, or whatever, that you can get in EVE with real money that you cannot get with in-game earned currency.
---
I'm waiting.
---
:-D
---
I haven't played in a really long time but I am thinking of scratching the itch again. Does every region rat with VNIs or drone boats now? Seems like high risk low reward trying to kill them. Are the days of using a cane to kill a tengu bot gone?
---
Barge is a skill detour, Porpoise with mining drones is not. And Porpoise - while not being as effective - still plays to all the strengths of semi-afk mining.
---
The most frightening part of this calculation is when you change starting point - put 30bil as entry investment and see where it goes in 18 months. Exponential growth without any realistic limit.
---
CCP changed the game. People complain that the game is less fun now, in part due to those changes. What about this is so difficult to understand?
---
This is the longest I’ve ever gone without logging back in. I wish you the best but this is Hotel Eve. Where you can check out but you can never leave
---
Hi sorry, where do i apply for my reddit license?, I'm dad.
---
/u/jibrish ok can we please stop all these EVE is dying / REEE EVE is dead / EVE is stagnant posts now? It's like 1/hour at this rate.
---
&gt;a fixed ceiling for how many anoms can spawn in a system in let's say a time frame of every 6 hours
---
That's why the ressources get refilled in intervals between DT-DT. Or let's say there can be a refill every 6 hours, and the refill gets triggered when ressources run out. If there was a refill in the 6 hours before that tough luck, you'll have to go farm another system.
---
If you're tinker snaking do C5
---
Mashed bananas are a measure of weight, not scale.
---
Is it that bad ? Where did you find this account to irl nerd ratio ?
---
&gt;  Conflict in EvE is by design pointless, an isk sink, a means to an end, the justification of amassing armaments for the sake of it.
---
I would have picturef it as people hoping to have fun crushing people except of course it's not so they get to brag about it, and obviously refusing to even get into a a battle where they could have fun but risk being the loosing side.
---
&gt;No more bitching on reddit, no more CCPlease, no more “I know how to fix this!”.
---
But the 14th(?) incarnation of CSM will surely fix this!
---
All of them
---
sits there and thats it?
---
Yeah, the CSM "experts" have done a tremendous job. Game is in a good place!
---
Yea they fixed the horrendously broken shit, but rorqs are still a bit too strong statswise in this mans humble opinion. But yea, thank fuck triple casb rorqs are not a thing anymore.
---
Why do I need to stop saying that I think thur game is shit when that's my opinion of it? 
---
I started playing in 2006. It was fun for 10 years. Now it's not fun. It feels like having a second job (especially in a null bloc), and CCP's changes are making it worse, not better. 
---
I don't *need* to do anything.
---
Hmm, thats what people said of Goons back in Saranen too ... all that happened were Fozzy-Claws and some insured T1-Welpflets such as Canes or Baltecs, but mostly it was "Haha we denied you content"
---
I mean, we are in the same thread right?
---
Do you want new players to EVE? Because I want new players in EVE, and most importantly to stick around
---
Oh, okay
---
What exactly is so controversial?
---
Negative player mindsets hurt the game.
---
Is that not a simple and objective enough concept?
---
Do yourself a favour and ignore this subreddit if you really just started out, you'll have a much better experience for it.

Drone boats have been *the* ratting meta for quite a long time now. About the only non drone/fighter types of ratting I ever hear about are multiboxing mach/etc smartbombers and titan boson ratting (yes, titan ratting...).

I genuinely don't get why no one is seriously arguing for removing Titans, Supers, and Rorquals.  It wouldn't solve everything, but it would solve one hell of a lot.
---
Eve Trade Master is just straight up ads without content - on mobile anyway
---
I'm using a heavy duty Loki, it's expensive but I don't lose them unless I really screw up and I can farm basically anything with it.
---
My lokis have been going 8:1 on isk and 90ish:1 on K/D between losses. 
---
I've been hunting Supers, Carriers, Rorqs and every subcap they ever undock with this Loki. When flown well it'll kill basically anything or harass it until it runs away due to expensive bits and pieces falling off.
---
It is high risk and low to nil isk reward. I'm just doing it for fun and to prove that they are not safe in their krab fortresses.

It's to the point now where Ranger Regiment docks up everything and runs away if I come into local which is a really nice ego stroke lol.

It's the same in Deklein really.
---
I think its a case of young people finding spaceships cool and fun and now that they're 15 years older their only idea about how to adult is to stop doing what they did when they were young, and to pay taxes, maybe do some chores and get some lifetime long debt and then pretend retirement isn't going to be just as bad as being young and unemployed with really bad health. 
---
Then having changed brain chemistry we rationalize it and say "the game changed and is no longer fun". Ignoring of course that we lost some brain cells to apoptosis and by the time we're middle-aged we are about half-way there to the lost cells required to get the Parkinson's diagnosis. Welcome to one of the seven aging processes you never learned about in biology class - here's hoping the stem cell research people you never thought to support with any money manages to finish the development of working stem cell treatments that replace lost cells, before we all die. The last generation to die and the first generation who could've done something during their lifetime to avoid being the last generation to die, are the same generation. The only question is which generation it will be. 
---
The second question is; When we've rejuvenated people back into 25 year old adults, from the brink of death by the diseases of aging (cancer, cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes, etc), will their nihilism towards in-game isk-making change? Or will they still be old in that they no longer have the drive for accomplishments that the young have? 
---
My question to the people is; At what point did eve online have to be meaningful? Its a waste of time, that's the point, don't come here 15 years older and ask "I could pve and do reactions and industry and make an empire to beat the goons back, ***but what's the point***?". Throughout eve history we've literally only spent energy and effort to defeat the big group (whoever it was at any given time), because the mountain was there to be defeated. Meaningless mountain, but as worthy a waste of time as anything else in this universe.
---
PL got crushed. Not by imperium it legacy but by their own hubris. They were comfortable with their cheating casino money. Once it was gone they were gone. Our can you point to the huge battle war they lost? To account for so many PL tiran and super vets simply proofing. You wanna know the truth? The vast majority of those people who still play biod there mains and coffin pilots and kind imperium out legacy.
---
This is a great obvservation.
---
Otherwise, moving our entire cluster into a new and better galaxy would be a good way to play the "EVE 2.0" without screwing over your entire playerbase so hard they all leave.
---
a combination of all the changes the last 5 years.
---
&gt;I'm coming up blank, here.

Nothing new there mate

See the part where you say the game isn't trash? That's an opinion. One that I don't share.

Welcome to /r/eve :)

Well, I've got stitch and insidious on 8-9, you on 10 just to fill all the slots. I was missing a official lowsec ballot like we wormholers did.

ALL HAIL YOUR NEW TRIGLAVIAN OVERLORDS.
---
&gt; Citadels haven't made it easier for new players
---
It's made it far more convenient and enticing, living out of a POS sucks...
---
&gt; Citadels make it more difficult to be evicted, you can citadel spam that much that it would be realistically impossible to remove you from a hole.
---
Maybe if you dump 100+ citadels? We've evicted people with 20 or more Citadels.
---
It didn't, it literally nerfed the blob.

---
I've had an issue with local since 2003, I've always thought that maybe it should be in high sec only to assist with the new player experience in EVE. It could even make be fit in to the lore somehow tying it in with the empires control over their systems, but for low sec and null get rid of it. By the time you get out to those regions you should know how to scan a system and be aware of potential threats.
---
Sorry in advance miners I'm sure some of you will disagree with this idea,
---
They're just waiting for winter . . . I think . . .
---
&gt;Eve is a game inherently parasitical; one man's misfortune is another's fortune
---
i will steal that line, that is great.
---
Maybe it do, but that's Eve. There'll always be people in a big mmo that want to talk about how a long-running game is dying. If the game actually falls to that, then I guess it was meant to be. Just another hurdle for the game creators to either deal with or ignore I guess. I think it'll be fine
---
When the game was lit I had a shitty GFX, but playing much PvP made me go potato anyways, now that I am an old bittervet I could afford a lit GFX and put everything to max, so I can enjoy nice Skins and NPC-"Realm"-Graphics, as the game mechanics I liked are all patched out ... Combined with my groups ingame channels it is the best looking chat tool for space nerds now by far ...
---
A few things you haven't consider:
---
* Initial wallet balance - many people that got on board already had a high wallet balance from moon goo or otherwise
---
* Brain drain/injector farms - Draining accounts that were on the market around the time of injector changes was lucrative. Many people have AFK injector farms which pay for themselves and make some profit on the side
---
* Moon mining profit - just because it's not passive, doesn't mean it's not a thing
---
I think if you look at anything in isolation it's very easy to create a reasonable POV of a change. However nothing in EVE is isolated and Rorquals are certainly not. Though I'm sure there are a few poor bastards out there trying to get into rorquals using your method of isolation, the proficient masses bought cheap and sold high.
---
Sorry but how does anything that's been introduced before match the level of aids that are citadels and rorq fueled localized super umbrellas?
---
Dont you understand guys? NCPL getting shit on is the end of the game! Haven't you read this is thread after thread? Do you believe it yet? How about now? Now? Maybe now. If you still dont believe, dont worry, there will be another thread to ram this idea home in a few hours, tops.
---
Jesus Christ thank you!
---
Very well and eloquently spoken.
---
I mean seriously people,
---
The game kept you entertained for SIXTEEN YEARS, now all sudden its ass? Nothing to do, game is bad, no content?
---
Games don't not only exist but still make news headlines SIXTEEN years after release because it's shit, get a grip people. YOU changed, YOU did everything you wanted to do, EVE is still everything is was even with a few changes, and btw there still after 16 years isn't a real EVE alternative, nothing comes close, you know this, and yet still call it shit.
---
Ok so just don't talk if you don't think you can bring anything of value. I still don't even understand what your original point was, and when I asked you, all you did was poorly ironic-respond. 
---
FYI, I was in QFC leadership while we were dying to INRI and worked with the band of total retards they called FCs and I have absolutely 0 respect for rote kapelle nor will I ever. The most pompous, damaging and useless group of players I've ever had the misfortune of encountering in this game. They consistently made the worse possible decisions and were by far the best example of "the player that thinks he knows everything" I've ever seen. 
---
So theres my reason, whats yours I wonder? Whats your personal experience with Rote Kapelle, what information can you add? What things have you done in this game that give you perspective here?
---
What if the world arc is made up of mashed bananas?
---
Sorry, I should've phrased that better. Reddit is like a talk radio. None of it is real, but if you turn the volume up enough you can pretend it is.
---
that would imply ccp does balance changes in the first place
---
it never fails to amaze me how people jump at the opportunity to blame the fucking players for complaining about a game that they pay for being bad, that's taking cucking to a whole new level.
---
Bets on how soon someone kills one?
---
Sounds like you need a break from mmo's, not just eve.
---
Exactly same thing people did for years before Keepstars ~~broke the game~~ allowed docking. Log off in space. Some supers might end up in asset safety if someone was reckless enough to own a super without having dedicated pilot for said ship, but then it's only them to blame for making that decision.
---
&gt;Ccp could probably help this by sticking to official forums or other official communication channels and stay out of reddit 
---
The nice thing about this subreddit is, despite the shitposting and toxicity, that you actually get to talk to people that are invested/somewhat knowledgeable about the game. If CCP were to stick to feedback from the forums this game would be dead in 6 months.

That’s what eve stands for? Holy shit I never figured that out.

I think at this point even my mom has invaded provi, should be a rite of entry for any alliance trying to hold sov-space.

Honestly, if they couldn’t wait a week or so for them to get bored then they would have left anyway. But also, shame on brave for not telling the members to relax and wait a bit or at least jump clone elsewhere.

It must be nice knowing you'll never die by stabbing because you're so good at missing the point.

HEY NEW PLAYER HERE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT STATE OF GAME BUT IT'S PERFECT AND YOU, PEOPLE WHO PLAY FOR MANY YEARS, ARE WRONG. I'M RIGHT BECAUSE I'M RIGHT

Ignorance is bliss, huh

My point exactly. It is going to take something drastic to make them pay attention.
---
So they’re playing the long con
---
The definition states "ANY gameplay advantage".  That doesn't have to be a tangible object that lets you blow up spaceships faster, such as golden ammo.  My ability to fund my activities with RL$ while you can't (because you can't afford to or are not willing to IS an ADVANTAGE.  
---
ANY means one or some of a thing or a number of things, no matter how much or many.  PLEX to ISK is one of those things that fit in the definition of ANY.  
---
You have to change or narrow the definition of pay-to-win to fix that.
---
If you honestly believe the game is trash, rather than its a good game with flaws, then your opinion in this particular instance does. Not. Matter.
---
This isn't a thread about not dogging CCP, it's a thread about PASSIONATE and ACTIVE players being a better influence in EVE to other active players.
---
If you feel the game is just ass then don't play and your opinion is wanted.
---
If you feel it needs some corrections then email CCP and make sure not to influence anyone to negatively or you may not have much of a game left to fix.
---
That's why I said arbitrary. Self awareness that my idea is only cursory.
---
because you clowns nurtured and promoted that culture and CCCP changed the game to embrace it.
---
You dropped 2 astrahuses in DO6H-Q... For the first astra's kill timer you gated your supercapital fleet to face off against an alliance who hadn't used a super in combat nearly 3 years, and could form maybe 10 capitals if needed. Yeah... totally not an eviction.
---
My problem with all the crying about Rorqs is that they are a capital ship and require a lot of isk and time to be able to fly. They should have an advantage over the other mining ships. Eventually they will be nerfed to uselessness and then everyone will be crying about how weak they are as a capital ship.
---
I'm paying for a product while watching all the revenue CCP generates from it be funneled into failed project after fail project. Meanwhile the game they make their revenue from, EVE, continues to suffer from lack of resources and attention. 
---
CCP could have a minor team devoted to just expanding current content such as new missions, new exploration content, minor balance changes, and dynamic events. Instead even this minor investment only materializes every few years and then no follow up. You can only run the same mission/site/event so many times before it becomes meaningless.
---
That negative mindset didn't just spring out of the ground for no reason.  Many vets have a negative mindset because CCP has proven time and again with their mismanagement and neglect of the game that the negative outlook is the *correct, factual* one.  I could act like nothing was wrong and predict Eve to live another 20 years, but that would be a lie.  Would you like me to lie to new players, to convince them to invest time and money into this universe on false pretenses, just so our game stays populated?  Because that's essentially what you're advocating.
---
Thanks for pointing out what I already pointed out, tried to demonstrate the negative affects of, and then offered an solution to.
---
Now that we have pointed it out, again, can we accept its a problem and commit to fixing it, yes player base, you have to be adults and take SOME responsibility, and change your very very consistent and widespread mindsets for the betterment of the game?
---
Look, they were neutral on PGL's overview. If that doesn't convince you of the seriousness of the issue, nothing will.
---
The part where those players try desperately to climb on top the way things used to be when they will the same ones pushing for the changes. 
---
At some point they need to realize that being on the high school football team was great when they were 17, but it's been years since then and they need to move on or one day they'll wake up and realize high school football was the best thing they ever did because they spent all their time wishing they could still be playing on the varsity team.
---
1) what's the isk/hr/snake for multiboxing tinker rattlesnakes in C5s nowadays?
---
2) what's the isk/hr on full-on escalations in C5s nowadays?
---
I haven't played in several years, so I don't know how it goes given changes since then.
---
That would explain the limp-dick syndrome CCP seems to have imbued missiles with, so yeah.
---
Ok let me at least try to give some concrete examples of things people aren't happy with you might have experienced already.
---
Take fleets, they're only really only formed for one of two reasons:
---
1. There's an objective (timer) you need to attack/defend.
---
2. You're going for a roam.
---
Take roaming first because that's easy. You usually get fights/kills by either tackling PVE ships or the other guys coming to shoot you just because you're there. Well since Citadel (May 2016) when they changed the capitals there's not a lot able to be tackled PVE wise anymore. VNIs are incredibly cheap and incredibly fast to get out, carriers/supers sit aligned out 100km away, and the obvious exception Rorquals are so tanky that it takes it either a very large or specifically designed fleet to kill them.
---
Next we've got objectives. Back at the start of 2015 you had 4 unique sovereignty structures to fight over and POS's that could be either valuable money moons or staging points. They all ultimately boiled down to grinding some HP on a structure, but at the 100-150 man fleets you're likely getting familiar with in Horde that job only really took 10 minutes.
---
So our 4 sov structures (Station/IHUB/TCU/SBU) are down to 2 with the removal of stations for citadels and SBUs no longer existing. The 2 that remain require entosising (a process which takes up to 60 minutes for a well populated system) and provides no way to speed it up. When the timer comes out, you have to run around the constellation entosising nodes that spawn. You've probably been in a few fights and hear folks talking about them a lot, the unfortunate thing is that bringing a fleet that can fight is actually _not_ the most effective way to win an entosis timer. Generally faster skirmish ships that can run away from danger are a better pick.
---
POS's are now gone too. They're still in the game and used sporadically, but their primary purposes of staging points, money moons and logistics (beacons/jump bridges) are gone leaving them as vestigial leftovers CCP haven't got round to removing yet.
---
This leaves us with just Citadels to get actual fights over. A fully powered Citadel timer takes between 16 and 56 minutes of grinding depending on how its fit and again there is no way to speed up this process. Fortizars (the ones you'll most often see fights over) are unreasonably powerful against capitals and due to their immense size combined with the damage cap pause mechanic provide a lot of unfun options for the attacker that a defender can't do a whole lot about (there's an essay on its own on this subject but I'll leave it for now). Keepstars too with their even higher power level and chain bounce doomsday make it very easy to headshot FCs and you'll rarely see actual "fights" over them, at least certainly not in subcaps.
---
Last of all, the defender has a great deal of control over when the timers come out for all of the structures. POS's had an overly complicated but interesting mechanic where they had a fuel bay and the timer would simply be however many hours of fuel were in that bay at the point it was reinforced, sovereignty structures the defender would set a 4-hour window of time in which it would exit, and the SBUs took 3 hours to anchor and were attackable at any time resulting in constant skirmishes. Even if you were trying to attack someone who was from a different timezone, you knew the timer would come out, so if you hit it on a Thursday/Friday night you knew you could still get the fight on Saturday/Sunday afternoon for example.
---
Today however those sov structures can only be entosised during a slim window of time, so there's no possibility of doing it earlier in the week for some weekend fun. Citadels after a change at the start of last year can at least be attacked, but you have no control over the day it comes out. While in theory it makes sense that a defender should pick their strongest timezone to defend, the reality is that the second they realise they're losing, they change all their timers to some horrible time of day in the middle of the week when the attackers will be asleep/at work meaning that there is not only little chance of a fight, but a horrible grind once they've admitted defeat.
---
Now again I'm not trying to tell you EVE isn't an amazing game because it really is. I've played for 6 and a half years and I still enjoy it. But everything I described above is a deliberate change made in the last 3 years by CCP which has made the game significantly worse for I would dare to say the majority of the people who play the game. And that's only one aspect of the game too, we're not discussing the economy, mining, UI changes, or ship balance.
---
I'm glad you're having fun and I hope you continue to do so for many years, but please don't mistake frustrated by legitimate criticism for whining.
---
Wonderful. Drone boats aren't worth the risk or effort to hunt. I'd end up flying something more expensive than what I am hunting. I had hoped that the meta changed but I guess not. :fuckccp:
---
I still do not understand why you don't address the fact that while the other coalitions could have done what the imperium did, start working, hard, defend space, spin the tedium into the promise of retribution... You guys chose to rent out space you chose to continue to use cheating techniques as the release of the botting per alliance account blacklisting showed us. This is the result of hard work. There were 700 people in alliance chat at the  at the end of the casino war. Now there are thousands. All because hard work, intelligent political messages, Srp second to
---
 None, logistical and administrative practices that improve on those of multiple TNCs and public shops I consulted for. You do the sandbox aspect of this game a diservice by lumping it all into broken game mecánicos and not addressing good game practices.
---
There are no small (unaligned) alliances involved in nullsec *at all* *anywhere*. Care to guess why? I'll give you a hint: it starts with "super" and ends with "blob".

If you sort by name you'll find there's a surprising number of people who went through the process of dying horribly twice or even three times in a row.

They should've given it a titan-killing, anti-fleet DD that just vaporizes everything within a 30km diameter lance.

That would actually make throwing a superfleet at it involve actual risk.

Hence this fucking post..

You know that, not all players do,

When the biggest forum on the internet has a group of people representing something, and the biggest theme, in the biggest forum, on the internet is "dead game" it effects it dramatically.

This is really quite obvious

no where near the scale at which these exist.

You do realize that a massive content seeking alliance (SkillU) just disbanded because its so damn hard to get content.

Thanks to timezone tanking, citadels and on and on and on.

The game is in serious trouble.

Definitely scanning relic sites (and I guess data if you want) in null and potentially low. I was making 40m+ an hour in a T1 exploration frig with shitty skills when I was a newbro. PM me in-game (Siaka Stevens) or Discord (Siaka_Stevens#5417) and I'll get you on your feet.
---
No ah it takes at least two weeks of vulnerability timers
---
Hey now, new agency window actually looks pretty slick. Much better than the previous.
---
Keepstars are probably the biggest offender in supercap proliferation. Ability to dock a supercap took away from wannabe super pilot all prior responsibilities and drawbacks of owning a super - being required to coffin character or get a sitter, having to worry about where you log off, finding place to keep your super in any case of going for any remotely extended afk period, being unable to stockpile supers beyond amount of pilots you had (and, due to prior points, kept subscribed). Just coffining a character wasn't the biggest change, all the logistics related to owning a supercap were major roadblock for some players and natural balancing factor that was impossible to early circumvent using just more ISK. No amount of ISK can buy you time, dedication and effort to deal with all the old bullshit of owning and using super. Oh, and there was all the fun of dealing with bumps every time there was rageping and everybody logged at the same time in same POS.
---
Having not purely specialized supercap pilot isn't that bad of a thing long term. One day you won't have that supecap anymore for any reason and then having subbed alt be useful for something else might come in handy. My titan pilot went through getting into bare minimum Naglfar pilot (sidetracked just for minmatar dread 4 and T2 siege), then got into a titan, after about a year I sold it around the time I realized that in new EVE of strictly consolidated alliances there's no place for a hyperrag memeing people without having a blob dropped on you just because everyone using caps does that in range of their blob. Good thing of that sidetrack is: after storing pod in NPC station I've got back fully functional dread pilot that could board random titan should I maybe one day luck out and find unpiloted one somewhere in space.

Read the whole post, never claimed I new anything other than the fact that you, after 16 years still play this game or at least lurk enough to be in this post.

Well he is not completely wrong, remember all the whining on Phoebe patch (2013) , as the "Kings of Lowsec" lost their moon empire because of jump fatigue and their supers when they missed their FC daddys move ops?

Oh, advise on eve forums are like 100x more shit.

Yea, this place is toxic, but genuine and no, I've not seen anyone being toxic to new player.

New bro, just ask whatever you want

If you have the patience/know-how to get your extractors and PLEX from buy orders rather than sell, you can cut down on that extra ISK needed drastically.

Absolutely you should. I'm just saying tinkers make c4s much less annoying than if your solo running. The payout is still shit compared to what youd make soloing c3s or tinkering c5s.

because it wouldn't happen even if ccp actually cared a little about balance, let alone how they are now. You dont blanket remove shit on that scale, its far too high a change and with far too many consequences to actually deal with
---
&gt; Calling it a sandbox doesn't mean it can't get stale. Eve isn't Minecraft.
---
I mean, minecraft has loads of tools. There's a reason they keep adding new ones as well. There's also a reason it is widely successful in the mod scene. Mojang aren't idiots, block-placer the game would not have had the long-lasting appeal without the actual *content*.

10 years into the game and  love it. No big bloc politics no F1 monkeying around,still no super’s and still engaged
---
Oh man if we are paranoid that everything that this sub complains about gets nerfed to uselessnes because of the complaining we will all be flying velators soon enough. 
---
Noone that argues for rorq nerfs wants to see them gone completely. They do drive pvp content and that is a blessing. But they just need to get adjusted more to be more in line with other ships.
---
CHEATING
---
CASINO
---
MONEY
---
I have quit eve .. still read /r/eve though.
---
I will come back if / when CCP make the game fun to play... so basically same time scale as star citizen leaving alpha.
---
You are really missing the point here buddy, the players are a factor, not the entire issue,
---
They. Are. A. Factor.
---
Now that I have gone out of my way to explicitly show the fucking obvious, please understand I'm addressing the factor the players possess, CCP is another conversation.
---
And using "cuck" makes any argument you have completely invalid. Don't hurt your own argument you took the time to write up with stupid shit and insults
---
Ughhh
---
Just make all capital skills reset every 6 months
---
I linked the Eve Uni fit I used and the skills I used. It’s not terrible, but it’s also not perfect skills/ideal/blingfit. The point was to estimate what a real person would reasonably see
---
Playercount 28k ? Man this must have been Saturday EU prime .... or any working day 2hrs after downtime
---
Ah I gotchu. Yeah, C4s are just an unhappy middle. Great for staging out of though.
---
if you're planning to join test, just join goons. Why be the pet when you can be the master? Literally no reason to join test
---
&gt;Severely overestimate our capacity for destruction
---
Do you seriously believe that if Horde, PL, NC and Frat all piled into Geminate and bunkered down, you would just sit on your limp dicks and watch us do it? Goons have de facto no other enemies than the mentioned alliances. You wpuld bring out everything you have to kill us, and we couldn't do anything about it.
---
I never said anything about needing a keepstar to control space. Dropping a bunch of structures in your enemy's space is how eviction happens. 
---
I'm not sure how I'm representing brave poorly. We fought hard to keep our space in Fade. I lost many maelstroms and scimitars. This was back in 2015 if I remember correctly. We fought up until the last second when we had no choice but to move. PL just had more supers and such, it wasn't worth sacrificing everything we owned to try to fight their caps. So after they took down the fortizar we moved. First to cloud ring, then to Catch, where we live now. Brave wasn't what it was after catch 1.0 and querious and we needed time to rebuild. Being farmed by PL and then evicted wasn't letting us do that. Honestly moving to Catch and having allies in legacy is the best thing to happen to brave since I joined. And that's not to say Catch was handed to us either. We have fought and continue to fight to maintain our sov there. I'd like to know where I'm representing brave poorly, because none of what I'm saying is meant to be complaining. I'm simply trying to point out the lies that grath is trying to tell. That they didn't evict Brave from Fade. Anyone who was in Brave at the time remembers.
---
100 people (with 10 alts each) isn't massive. plus they were taking payments via PayPal for botting rental systems in drone lands. not sure how that hurts the game now that they are gone.
---
I cant speak to how or why PL died off, but we all know why goons rule 2/3 of the galaxy right now.
---
I have no clue why CCP stood by and watched the MER graph be so completely lopsided for years now without doing anything about it.
---
That imbalance should have never been possible.
---
If he's looking for advice the IG help channel is probably the best place imo.
---
This subreddit lately has turned into a shithole of bittervets and spodbrains vomiting spin into threads after threads, can't really imagine anything worse for killing a newbro's desire to play the game.
---
Sorry, my bad. Didn't realize that there were links.
---
keep yourself safe
---
Oh, in that case, burn on triggies!!!
---
The only way to stop these posts is if you buy the new “posi-reddit” skin in the store. With your $99 purchase you can help hilmar afford his retirement.
---
Then again Mebbe folks are onto something....like they see eve going in a bad direction and want to stop it.
---
1) what are you looking to spend your time doing in eve?
---
2) where in eve would you like to live? High, low, null, wormholes, etc
---
3) how much sp do you have?
---
In other threads I would have downvoted this, in this thread ... have my up
---
low glows\*
---
You got years out of eve. If you no longer like it don't pay for it. But don't deny new players those years of fun and experience you once had because your no longer happy.
---
CCP has made plenty of mistakes like any company will over almost 2 decades, but that is not the issue my post is about. Please read the whole post.
---
Fixed within 10 minutes after exodus was pinged on slack.
---
For the next time just go here:  [https://pathfinder-eve-online.slack.com](https://pathfinder-eve-online.slack.com/)  Then you got direct access to upcomming features and admin @ /u/jehe /u/ohhihellohi and /u/Laggeros
---
That was deep, man
---
There probably aren't 1300 active people in lowsec...
---
hilmar!!! invite me to your costa rican mansion full of cocaine and hookers plz!!!
---
You guys track your members zkill stats?
---
Obvious black flag post by Pamfam. Gotta try and control the narrative somehow I guess.
---
Cool I’ll make sure to check in with the YouTube and Reddit Shitposting Board of Approval before messing around and creating a video next time 👌🏻
---
My wallet likes it. And I enjoy killing PL. But I hope that after this is over, maybe we'll kick PL into playing Planetside for a few years, and then we can have a good ole war with goons. It's one thing to fight against a mortal enemy (in my eyes, PL) and another to fight against a group that's been (relatively) honorable in the spirit of good fun spaceship combat. I don't love the blue donut because I know it's bad for the game if it remains for a very long time. But I think that at the moment there's a bigger evil at play, which is frat botters and PL evil. That's my opinion, and why I can be in legacy and still disagree with the blue donut as a whole.
---
He made a mistake in his cron job. He got new cert, but did not restart the webserver. It's fixed now.
---
&gt;  I'm almost bitter vet status at this point
---
that´s just because deep down inside you know that i speak the truth!
---
PL didn't get crushed by thier own anything. They lost an economic war by a landslide. 
---
Goons have been magnitudes ahead of everyone in the galaxy on the MER since rorquals happened. Now they dominate the galaxy from an impenetrable fortress of titan and keepstar spam. 
---
As usual, goons have found how best to exploit the game, and abused it beyond what should be human capability. Except this time CCP sat on thier haunches and watched it happen without doing fuckall except minor nerfs to rorqual yields
---
Oof, that's a lot. I've only done fuel blocks and some rigs (but mostly fuel) but i guess if you're doing industry to the tune of tens of billions then that really eats into it. Thanks for answering all my questions, I've been winning EVE for years but I might give it another shot
---
The biggest irony is that that was the intent of it - discovery and interaction for players (primarily in HS for obvious reasons) because the game felt empty.
---
Sounds likebad luck tbh. When I multiboxed four ishtars in deklein I got around 3-5/day.
---
Try to do havens only as you'll clear them quickly and therefore get more done in the same time and increase 10/10 chances.
---
If you have any other questions about null PVE feel free to PM me, I have lots of experience.
---
“Titans are still rare.” 
---
Do you get out much? Like really do you ever undock?
---
You are telling me a new player doesn't have YEARS of content before everyday hitting the issues you are now? Because to say no would go complete against reality, and yes, you originally had a reason to invest into the game, that reason still exists for new players.
---
There are hundreds of ships, professions, activities, jobs, events, skills,
---
Because later or end game or elite play is lacking doesn't mean all this shit A. Just goes away or B. Is for some reason less exciting to new players
---
So the problem is the umbrella response, not the ships under it.  We have seen fighter nerfs and HAW nerfs on Titans. Seems ccp is addressing the actual problem with tweaks. Imagine that.
---
Gotta blame CCP for that. I think it's absurd that alliances are allowed to balloon to 15-20 thousand members when the average logged in is like 18k. Makes no sense. All it takes is one entity to attain capital dominance and game over. Kind of like it is now. The messed up part is that these large entities will never do anything to jeopardize their own power for the health of the game. So we descend further into stagnant safety empires.
---
Love you too, baguette.
---
People like to complain instead of coming up with new solutions to their gameplay or problems. I agree this game is amazing.
---
Yeah, you have not dropped dreads there for a whole 3 day's that must be very inviting.
---
Without players, the game has basically nothing to offer. This is what happens when devs ignore the community.
---
I suppose you could say making it more convenient is making it easier for new players but it also makes it easier for vets for the same reasons. I personally think citadels were one of the worst additions for both wh and null.
---
Why are you still giving CCP money is the real topic I'd like to read here. 😑
---
Why not just enjoy it until it dies, then move on to the better games? There will be better games by then. Even if people agreed with you, it's not gonna stop the complainers.
---
But I mean, you've pretty much sealed the deal here. I'm 95% sure you're just grasping at straws, looking for some way to push people's buttons. I think you're having as much fun commenting as I have had reading. No worries, even if you are new, you fit right in to Eve: Online and it's playerbase. Good hunting mate o7
---
Maybe next year we can get one, hopefully more people run
---
No,how about just making mechanics that capitals are not the end all be all
---
no, we just name and shame idiots.
---
this literally happens every year, the wording might be different, but for 12 years I have seen the same repetitive shit over and over, whether it be EVE forums, kugu, or r/eve.
---
"*but this time it's different! titans! supers!*"
---
No, you fucking 22 chromosomed cognitive failure, it's the same as the year before, which was the same as the year before that, which - you guessed it - was the same before that... it's always something.
---
P.S. I'm not responding directly to you I'm just venting.
---
Honestly could you give some tips on setting up those spreadsheets? I'm having trouble.
---
Can i cloak at the beginning of the fight and uncloak at the end to win? :-)
---
&gt;TL;Dr run the code yourself and not only be more secure, but stable.
---
And fast. So freaking fast (compared to demo site)
---
\&gt;Implying spod brains only mine 3 hours a night  
---
\&gt;Implying people don't buy plex and inject  
---
\&gt;okay anon w/e u say
---
To add, passive tanking is often both better AND cheaper for armor caps.
---
It specifically says OVER their unpayed counterparts.
---
That's the part you keep glossing over like it doesn't matter.
---
Nobody ever said buying plex isn't an advantage, all isk is an advantage.
---
We've just been saying that it's not an unfair advantage as its an advantage also possibe without buying any plex.
---
What is world arc? Some crap CCP pacified what's left of the playerbase with?
---
&gt;We haven't been sitting on them to poach their FCs
---
fcs leave to other alliances because they'd rather be on said other alliances. If you people spent half the time you wasted crying about poaching actually making a better place for them to fc it wouldn't happen nearly as much.
---
Correct.  This sub is a relentless wall of negativity.
---
Darkness is botting
---
Then you're reading it wrong. Brave is as strong as it's ever been. I'm making more isk than I've ever made and flying cooler shit than I've ever had. I want no sympathy.
---
What I want is for grath to stop lying about what happened in Fade. I don't understand how what I'm saying is asking for sympathy but what grath is saying isn't. They're blatantly lying about what happened in Fade so that they can cry "grr tapi grr gons" as if the temporary alliance between legacy and imperium is anything but their fault. They refuse to accept the blame for the shit they're in now. I'm happy shooting their caps and their friends caps all day. Killing PL is my favorite thing. :) I need no sympathy.
---
&gt;I cant speak to how or why PL died off
---
Because they always were the big bad boogeyman that could mess up your day at any point. Everybody wanted to join them because of it. The second that was no longer feasible was the second that "old PL." stopped existing in it's classic form. So they did the next best thing. Renting space out. Let people that want peace and quiet be protected by the people that want loud explosions, for a fee. Except then, the meta shifted to the current "stuff as many people into a region as possible, as it's resources are near limitless". PL. just can't adapt to that without fundamentally changing what they are.
---
&gt;I have no clue why CCP stood by and watched the MER graph be so completely lopsided for years now without doing anything about it.
---
Because that's not the graph they see or care about. The graph they see is the $$$ that roll in from all those rorq alts and skill extractors. And all is good on that front, so why bother changing anything? The economists they had departed years ago. CCP barely play their own game, and especially not in null where all this is taking place.
---
&gt;That imbalance should have never been possible
---
Sure, but that wasn't the point of my original comment.
---
It's "bare minimum to be allowed to join fleets" more than "fully skilled". Fully skilled Rag is around 70mil SP if you disregard ability to fly or do literally anything else.
---
'tis merely a jest.
---
well they *were* undefended so...
---
Or .... just use carriers?
---
Hearing TAPI line member stutter and scream on comms begging their fleet members not to shoot goons whenever they see them in local almost makes it worth it.
---
You take Tribute and Vale of the Silent away from them.
---
I did and if you think the community has had more impact on player retention and growth than CCP's own poor decisions you clearly don't understand the issue people have with the game at all.
---
If anything this community is what keeps people playing long after the actual game play stops being fun.
---
Yeah and you also had TISHU posters whining that their supers didn't one shot frigates... Not all mongoloids on reddit have valid opinions.
---
&gt; I've changed my mind. Yes, these ships are powerful, but it seems totally reasonable for a player to invest so much time and ISK and get a few more Rorqs out of it.
---
Congratulations on rediscovering the means to justify broken game mechanics like the original Titan Remote Doomsday to yourself.
---
This is an adorable morale post. They can afford to get dunked 200 more times. While you'll tap out and deplete SRP in like 5. Enjoy your smugposting. 🙄
---
like super capitals or something
---
At the current cost of high energy physics, it costs about $1 per atom to make anti-matter. That doesn't count the cost of building the particle accelerator/collider.
---
It's only because there aren't as many sites. If you go around Stain at all, explo bots are rampant. Ratting bots can keep going 23/7.
---
I thought it was generally accepted that this sub is for bittervets...
---
There was a time when barges existed but were still outperformed by the mining Cruisers until nearly max skills. If you didn't just stop at the Cruiser you sat in one while you trained for the Barge.
---
They are overrated. I owned a few. I gave them away. Takes no skill
---
If it didnt for OP, it did for me, and I'm sure countless others in the sub.
---
Very well thought out and presented. Have an upvote kind sir.
---
1300 characters I meant. We have like 300 active on zkill in the last week. Come fuck us up.
---
just like most of the structures youre killing so...
---
A little precision on the Heavy Interdiction Cruiser’s Warp Disruption Field Generator.
---
While it cannot be used to create a bubble in Empire space (lowsec and nullsec), it can still be used if it’s scripted. I don’t know if you’re aware of what happen to scripted WDFG, but it basically transform it in a disruptor or scrambler with improved range, and an infinite strength.
---
In highsec, this is still considered as an aggression act, so you’ll get CONCORDOKKEN by using it on a ship without a timer on him.
---
However, the scripted module is still useful in empire space. It simply negate the use of Warp Core Stabilizers if one manage to lock a target fast enough before it warp out (hence why some HIC fits use a lot of Sensor Boosters), and in lowsec it’s the easiest way to tackle a supercapital vessel because of the massive bonus they get to warp core stability.
---
K
---
This guy makes me ashamed to be in NCPL... what a tryhard.
---
im for it.
---
1:2, yes
---
We have large swaths of empty space already. You really want more empty no content space? How about less space , less resources more conflict. Someone needs to save this shit game. Adding space isn't helping
---
press recall drones, press align
---
loop a check whether drones are in until they are
---
press warp
---
god im a fucking programming god
---
I was thinking just this but would go a step further. 
---
These new systems should put the emphasis on player controlled systems. Players should be able to build gates and also set the sec for controlled space. Corps/alliances should be able to hire NPC's to protect their space if they want to simulate high sec. They should also be able to hire NPC's to attack (like rats) other systems.
---
Thank you so much for taking the time to inform me of the deeper ins and outs of what is going on, as a new player it was so much more effective than the majority of divisive replies here.
---
Your time was not wasted as I will be studying this and catching up.
---
But I would like to say, this is all only one specific aspect of the game, pvp and regional control in low sec,
---
Eve is about a billion more things than just region control, and players can spend an enternity doing many other things, so I hate to see so many players sitting all over eve for the mistakes in this one catagory, and putting a blanket over the ENTIRE game as being shit. It's damaging the games fabric
---
Instead of balancing ships.  Add a frakton of new ships.  Not just add this skin. But different appearances and pros and cons.  I understand that a frig and such only has so many slots.  But different appearances and such just so people feel like they are flying different ships.
---
Well, in the real universe, space is also a hek log of nothing
---
Oh, right, my mistake. I just saw all those zkill links and isk numbers and got confused that you might be looking at killboards. Won't happen again, I promise.
---
I'm not glossing over anything.  I feel it's an advantage because it is not an activity that fits within the boundary of the gameplay.  I use a RL resource, to buy an in game resource.  Even though I don't need to, as the game is capable of providing me all I need.  I am not willing to do the work to play according to the confines of the sandbox.  The fact that we can do that is an advantage.  As long as I'm willing to spend more money than you are, PLEX to ISK provides the advantage of saving time, and not a trivial amount of it.  In the real world time = money.  In the EVE world time = ?  What is your time worth?
---
its okay op. dont listen to these people. He likely doesn't even play the game anymore, few on this subreddit still do and just like to sprinkle salt on their popcorn as they read the events going on
---
everyone got that moola bud. thats how much they hated goons. it wasnt that much compared to how much spod gets sucked in delve monthly
---
Maybe it will do like the HALO does in the halo universe and just kill everything and we all start from scratch
---
It’s missing a load off.
---
Smaller groups wouldn’t have enough FAXes on grid for the stacking penalty to have a large effect. Against larger groups a dread buff would have been countered by adding a few dozen more faxes
---
This sounds fun. I am in.
---
I feel sorry for you if you're using your full attention to grind $0,20 per hour in your VNI
---
go to wormholes
---
unsurprisingly, the best space in Eve doesn't have supers, good mining, local, a static map, or 1000v1000 blobs as the only form of content
---
You're missing the point. There's no one left to "fuck you up". They've all gone to null, quit or do small gang stuff.
---
Don't attack the EVE reddit player base.  They don't have a sense of humor.  Jokes aside, blaming the player base isn't going fix anything.
---
I’m about to be ready for my t3c, I play around a lot of pilots with a lot more alts and isk than me, the SP loss is the ONLY thing that makes them feel the loss of one.
---
They are in there own class in wspace, a proper fit Strat can hope to take one on, everything else will die or never get engaged because they are not cov-op.
---
&gt;titan-killing, anti-fleet DD that just vaporizes everything within a 30km diameter lance. 
---
Ouch.
---
I like my idea better
---
Fuck off.
---
So people who have actually trained them for years lose them ? Sounds fair
---
Dude I don't need you to try and reduce my argument by telling me to lighten up,
---
I'm not cursing, angry, or hateful. You aren't making my argument weaker by claiming I'm in some way unsettled. If you would like to address something specificially, please do. Otherwise, this grown ass man doesn't need your input. Eve reddit has 1.5 THOUSAND active users, that's 1/10 of active players and probably hosts 1/2 of all major eve news and traffic.
---
EVE reddit has an influence. And btw I'm talking about an over arcing mindset of the player base, not just the mindset on reddit. The mindset has infiltrated the community and is damaging it from within.
---
Or Goons crying about Tracking titans as they did not manage to handle 50 Raiden.Titans with Reps with their 1500 Maelstroms at that time, but now crying when CCP nerfed the HAW guns on Titans again (but mah ticks ...)
---
If the lance has a limited range you can comfortably sit outside of it with carriers. If it doesn't, then there's no point as you can't really do anything against it with capitals
---
I think your more interested in the idea of protest then actually helping the game, and for that, I’m out.
---
holy fuck, sort the graphs by values. please.
---
That's bait
---
&gt;This game is freaking amazing! It is unlike anything else in existence, and has almost 2 decades worth of content and development.
---
Mate.
---
I see I've started a thrend. Everyone now meausers other ships in Provinences.
---
“Bombers Bar” and “risk anything” used in the same sentence ...
---
then fax have to go too
---
someone is a little salty. pretty sure the KB shows anything but dead. but thanks for the free salt
---
And if you people spent half the time in the game that you do whining on reddit, you might not be losing this war.
---
It's not full attention, peripheral vision is enough. You guys must really have rotted your brains on spod.
---
I remember when I felt like you - I then played the game for year and a half and released the truth for myself. Enjoy the high while it last.
---
You lost me there. You want us to make them pay attention--fine. But if we want them to pay attention we need something for them to pay attention *to*.
---
yeah why not.
---
no other game i have ever heard of has something in it that can teleport to other players, apply nearly 500% more DPS on a player and then have the ability to get more "heavy healers" teleported onto it.
---
it is just a ludacris idea. Get rid of combat capitals ability to use cynos. Make them take gates so that a real logistical plan must be put in place if you want to drop the hammer on someone. JF's can use regular cynos.
---
Structures have a damage cap, are on a timer,  three phases, etc. Thus a defence can be planned.
---
Are you unironicly comparing the two? No I am sure.
---
Theran, duh, their human leader is a dick
---
&gt;Did they really save up enough ISK to buy such a massive investment by themselves?
---
sure, structures are cheap.
---
It's hard to follow this discussion cause you keep screeching at everyone, but it looks like you're responding to his tapi vale talks with stuff about brave in fade? even trying to pull the victim attention from tapi, really, you're a perfect fit for legacy.
---
Don't hide their names.
---
I'll let you in on a little secret: it's always been ass. It's just the only/best game of its type while still being ass and we're so invested in it that we complain and hope for it to improve significantly but CCP is too busy trying to stay warm in their arctic wasteland making failed project after failed project to try and strike at rich rather than fix the fucking product that got them to where they are.
---
As to your complaint, what specifically are the mean ol'e bittervets doing to you to chase you off, anyway? You never elaborated on what problem you were having other than your petulant disagreement about the opinion of the game. You just threw out a generalization that "YOUS GUYS ARE TO BLAME!" without saying why.
---
because it would kill off CCPs main revenue stream.
---
So, you don't actually know what you're talking about, then. I understand.
---
CCP *do* dictate gameplay, though. The rules of the sandbox (ship balance, timer mechanics, jump mechanics, faucets, mining yields, etc.) determine how people play the game.
---
There's a reason almost every subcap except the VNI isn't used for ratting in k-space: because it's just straight up the best ship for that task. Offering you 200 other subcaps to rat in is meaningless when they're just inherently worse.
---
This applies on the macro level too: yes, you *can* be a nomadic sovless alliance, but the mechanics offer nothing to benefit this style of gameplay. You *can* fight everyone instead of creating a blue donut, but there's no benefit to doing so because it doesnt help you to win.
---
It's what we did in 2016 after fleeing the north, and it worked out for us, somehow. Figure it out.
---
world arc is dead
---
Lol.  PL did field the biggest capital fleet in every battle they chose to commit to.   Up until the battle of X47L-Q.  If only they hadn't attack TAPI
---
It's almost as if it's in the name or something. **bitter** vets.
---
"It won't happen" is only true as long as people are apathetic.  CCP responds to a sufficiently loud chorus of voices.
---
As for how large of a change it would be--it would be a huge change for the massive nullsec blocs, but 90% of players would barely notice it, at least at first.  
---
Titans and Supers are no longer so expensive that losing them really hurts a major bloc, but they are expensive enough and hard enough to produce that a group without much power to start with will struggle mightily to put a significant proportion of their members into them.  This combination means that the most powerful groups will only continue getting more ridiculously powerful until one of the elements changes.
---
In contrast, even relatively weak alliances can put almost all of their members into dreads/carriers/faxes, or could do so with enough incentive.  If the supercap threat was removed, imagine the massive capital battles among smaller groups that we would relatively rapidly start seeing.
---
&gt;when Joe is the voice of truth in eve
---
TIL that the cancer was inside of us all along :3
---
Truly a massive investment of 500 mil isk.
---
haha vertical
---
umm...
---
ok?
---
71 Rorquals - gotdayum.
---
I’m not pushing anything. I just want a real war with meaningful fights. That’s all. We’ve had them before. Nothing to do with CSM - I keep in-game politics out of that stuff. Don’t be an Olmeca who can’t tell the difference.
---
Mmmh true, so maybe a better starting point would be to look at those with more mids.
---
Well then allow me to reply in kind (not to you, but in general)
---
Hey you fuckstick. Every year in the summer the number of players drop yeah, we get that. But NOT every year we have had every thing ccp does focused on making money (skins/plex). 
---
Hey since your up on history, when was the last year they sacked the alliance tourney? 
---
When was the last year we saw one alliance with a whole fleet of titans? 
---
When was the last year ccp sacked the entire community team? 
---
I get there is a yearly cycle, but Mebbe, just Mebbe this year is different. 
---
Again not saying your a ignorant, just saying some people won’t see what’s happening til it falls off of the sky, lands on their face and squirms around a bit
---
OP didn't claim he's a good pilot tho, he only said he's good at what he does.
---
I guess the "massively defender-favoring citadel and sov mechanics" only work for us and not for everyone else.
---
Wait here i been shooting red crosses for 2 years to affod that titan.
---
I'll be at Eve Vegas. I definitely still play the game.
---
FAX were a mistake anyway, they've been nothing but trouble for balance at all scales of PVP. Sold a lot of injectors tho lol
---
&gt; Are covert cynos immune to jammers?
---
So many baguettes
---
+ another 950 for shuttles and corvettes, I'd say that's pretty much all he does.
---
Panic mode allows a defense to be planned.
---
I mean if you want to say they don't count we can too. 
---
Good faith is needed from both sides friend.
---
Just get a small control tower and anchor it. They count as far as I know.
---
As someone who is heavily invested in caps... this.
---
So will EVE dying.
---
If you think eve 2019 is the greatest game ever I'm truly sorry for you... just suffice it to know you'll never see the beauty that eve was.
---
Yes, I am.  Because this is a PvP-driven game, a content-creator-driven game, you need a certain critical mass of experienced FCs and other leadership for it to function.  If those people leave, the whole system goes down, and let me tell you, they're leaving.  SkillU just caused the largest sov drop in the history of the game a few days ago for exactly these reasons.  Every non-Snuff lowsec group is gone.  TRI is all but gone.  Any number of smaller groups have closed up or widoted into blocs.  The game is fast running out of people to fight, and without an enemy it doesn't matter how old your character is.  I'm still finding fun in this game, but I'm also not blind to where it's going, and I'm going to scream about that as loud and as long as I can in the likely vain hope it'll change.
---
I take as much time with each individual commentor, that's how you make change, you concince people to change 1 on 1 through conversation.
---
I made a point and am actively defending it and interested in talking with each and every person.
---
This is called a position you can support and have a reason to convey, this is not a person aimlessly looking to be combative. I feel like that's very obvious if you look at the consistency of my replies
---
The majority of would seem, oh yes
---
To have a war declared against you, you only need to anchor any upwell structor, a POS, or a customs office in space.
---
To declare a war you need to have any upwell structor anchored and to declare your structor declared as a War HQ.
---
Please note this does not include the FLEX structors.
---
I hope that clears things up
---
I never said that either.
---
Please stop creating reasons to disagree with me. I started none of that.
---
you just want to gate your freighter worth 200t cargo into jita?
---
To a grizzled veteran that might seem small, but for a startup corp like mine that is a big investment with our funds.
---
It worked out because the base game mechanic changed, but you refuse to acknowledge that point.
---
Oof
---

wormholer btw
---
**REMOVE LOCAL AREADY FOR FUCKS SAKE!!**
---
already ded
---
TIL, AND GREAT - one of the biggest EVE resources there is is filled with salt vets discouraging new players, that's fucking terrible, let's change that :D!
---
Eve subreddit culture is perpetuating aspects of player activities that are the actually responsible for players stopping/ceasing the activity known as playing eve online? 
---
**IMAGINE MY SHOCK**
---
Yes I know they followed them around but was the hell camp for months on end? How many times do you undock and die before you realize you should go to a different station?
---
Time and boredom is the great equalizer.
---
Excellent shitpost.
---
Oh. Well you had me
---
He hasn't been downvoted enough by the common downvoter yet to count as being welcomed, you salty twats.
---
Agreed they are not worth the cost and sp loss over the new HACs to even bother most of the time. 
---
SP loss should be moved to Titans. Make it risker to use one than it currently is. If you get baited and lose a 50+ day train skill you might think twice about the drive by Boson/DDs on small fleets and such. You alliance should really have to commit when a super/titan is dropped. Currently a solo-ish activity for some.
---
&gt; The people that your suggestion would hurt are Krabs with 3 active accounts, all running sites at once
---
This shouldn't be a thing and I'm fine with 'hurting' (it wouldn't, really, because the levels of ISK fountaining would adjust prices) these people, because extremely low risk, low effort, high reward ISK generation is bad for the game.
---
at this point: probably nothing. people have moved on.
---
Oh yeah. Force everyone to fight. :) Bwahahahaaa! Time to get your bones highsec. ;) j/k
---
Solid bananahumour.
---
If you have gun from old drops then yes.       
---
Building from BPC is almost as costly as T2.
---
Fair, but it's time to gamble, is it not?  CCP can see how the numbers are moving.  They know something major has to change, and I haven't heard any solutions likely to work better.
---
"salty" right out of the pleb handbook. your corp/alliance is a joke
---
Cajun spice need the tust flakes.
---
What month is 24? I'm confused.
---
What about the SIGs deployed in Delve to protect SOV / counterdrop?
---
Ofc they count, you can even count them twice, it won't really matter :D
---
null sec economy is just too strong, there is no reason for a new player to go to low, high or wh when he can just join goons, inject a rorqual and start making isk with no effort
---
CCP needs to give us reasons to live more spread out, and reasons to invade other regions. You can't tell the players to just do that without a reason
---
You guys all have phones right ?
---
It's not a player created situation it's a gameplay one. Players only do what gameplay allows them to do and if gameplay says turtle, krabing and make agression as unfun as possible then guess what people are going to do
---
Post like this make me wish you stayed on the other side of the Eve Gate. Good day sir.
---
People also don't want to be evicted every few weeks
---
Reactions don't fountain anything into the game and their value is entirely market based.
---
PI is a more legitimate point but you can't get anywhere near the ISK/effort of rorq mining under and umbrella with PI.
---
If you can't afford a medium structure you probably can't afford the means to defend it either so it's probably a bad idea anyway
---
It's just normal discorse that happens to bait out the common toxic and salty poster with nothing better to do than stalk and downvote. Go be low tier elsewhere.
---
Why would people work against their own best interests in a competitive game? It's not a "hands off" game and never has been, the rules of the sandbox are CCP's responsibility.
---
1. Players Revolt and schedule Logout; CCP can plan for PTO/Holiday on 24th.
---
2. Logout occurs
---
3. CCP Datacenter Auto-scales down 
---
4. CCP saves money
---
5. Profit and back to business as usual.
---
And how much of this is accounted for by uncontested keepstar kills? Riveting content right there.
---
I really miss the days of can baiting on the fed navy station in Dodixie.
---
"blaming"
---
Ok let's rephrase so people can be directly blamed and therefore NO ONE is held accountable and we can push everything off on CCP. because heads up, CCP gets the blame for everything. 
---
Same deal, round 2.
---
Public announcement : do not claim the game is dead or dying. It has negative consequences. 
---
We good?
---
Boy was that absolute shit at being impactful.
---
*Points to release of NPC shipyards for the spod brains to remember*
---
why the fuck is this downvoted?
---
meh, honestly doubt Eve still plays a role in future CCP/PA roadmaps. It´s in maintenance mode until revenue dries up and development assets will be shifted towards mobile game development or other projects. If CCP will even continue to exist as an independent studio under PA.
---
people doesn't stop playing because of reddit lmao, a very small portion of the playerbase even reads reddit. 
---
Less players every year its a fact, and its because this game is getting stale.
---
Deep mate, real deep.
---
It's not that I can't afford it. It's more like I don't want to waste 500 million ISK on something that doesn't count as a "structure".
---
You are at work? Was unaware Junior High Student was considered a job. Until you learn the difference between there, their, and they're that is all you will ever be.
---
That's why I said **AND**
---
Branch*
---
It doesn't matter. But if you're going to present war stats present the entire picture.
---
On top of them already having the subscription fee XD
---
If you REALLY wanted to fuck with CCP, it would be to mass un-subscribe for a month, but no one has the balls.
---
So if you find min/max gameplay boring because it's so limited.... Why are you still min/maxing? 
---
CCP isn't forcing anyone to fly the VNI, that's a choice *players* make.
---
Maybe try some something unconventional or less than optimal.
---
24/6/19, what month is 24? December Squared? I'm confused.
---
CCP has abandoned this subreddit.
---
Devs haven't responded to legit criticism in YEARS.
---
Hard to believe it, but EvE really is likely dead at this point.  Triglavian invasion is a bust.  Nerfs to incursions killed that community.  PVE still sucks ass.  PVP still rewards cheese over skill.
---
It was fun while it lasted, but the eve sandbox is officially too full of catshit to be used anymore.
---
How about continuing the nerf to capital and supers application to subcaps un exchange for a removal of damage cap on structures ? A lot less people would leave the game and many balance and content issues would be fixed
---
&gt; Edit: Obviously there is the awnser of "remove Injectors" but I don't see that happening
---
Injectors should act like accelerators, then you can use them to double your training speed for a fee, but you can't insta-inject a capital pilot. An actual newbro isn't going to know what to do with 10 million skill points on day 1 anyway.
---
2 of our guys did infact do that. They were super dumb and i think it was a very good decision by the GM. That kind of stuff is just rediculous.
---
However, like me, i got reported for posting a bingo card. I am a huge local shit poster, and it was just odd the be reported for a bingo card, when i have posted in other locals calling people risk averse for not undocking, and spamming for nearly 20 minutes straight "Undock"
---
So it just struck me as odd. However, paint with a broad brush all you want, not all NSH are spamming porn in local or telling people to kill themselves IRL. Some of us just like banter.
---
In my ticket it was said specifically for posting the same link to the SMA Sota 6 times in under 10 seconds. I do not post NSFW in local.
---
McDonald's serve naglfries when?
---
Ok but wardecs cost money too, I think around 100 mil isk per 2 weeks? So yeah, might want to get some income generation going on. AFK VNI alt in Horde or Karmafleet might help.
---
Iunderstoodthatreference.gif
---
&gt; my main idea was that so a couple of people in ships worth 200-300mil in total couldn't quickly kill a Rorq
---
They couldn't anyway because of the Rorq's normal tanking abilities.
---
Because they were there during PL.s prime, yeah? Look I know reading is hard if the words don't say "Spodumain", but at least try before posting.
---
That video does not show it for me?
---
Take part in EvE Logout on 24-6-19 and force CCP and Pearl Abyss to pay attention to the gameplay problems
---
Shit my Bowhead is still on the way and the invasion is already cleared?
---
Do you have another clip because this one ends and it's still there.
---
It has no content.
---
Who says they are?
---
Sure, but I don't have a side. Unless you count the side of reason. Never the less your equating a seven minuite timer to one that can be many hours to days. Seems like a legitimate argument.
---
The majority of kills in the original post are carriers and supers. Your strawman implies they have panic modules. Also a  legitimate argument.
---
Better have been top!
---
Are you spoiled by this game? 18 months of the same game is insane, how many games exists on the planet that can get 18 months of play? And 18 is miniscule compared to some.
---
Like, you've got to be kidding me - if someone told me I'd only get 18 months out of death standing id shit my pants in excitement
---
&gt;  They scale better than any ship in the game because there's no counter to them, just more supers.
---
I would put all capital ships apart from dreads into this equation - there's no downward asymmetric balance (like a tackle frigate or a cruiser being able to take on an unsupported battleship) with capital ships, and that's a huge game design problem. Particularly when capitals - unlike any size of subcap without a bridge, apart from deliberately squishy covert cyno ships - can be dropped instantly anywhere in the cluster.
---
Capital ships should support combat subcaps, not replace them.
---
I understand. I run a merc corp and I wanted to expand our operations to allying defending corps. The only way to do that is to have a structure; hence why I am here.
---
So, a fleet of like 50 dudes going at it for an hour  
---
It dropped nothing  
---
Everyone got about 200 LP  
---
And instead of an epic explosion it warped away.
---
CCP, you've done it again, I'm truly impressed by this.
---
Only if T3c get nerfs, but you don't want that do you? 
---
Yet another case of PVP players wanting things and not caring about what their wants mean for the rest of the game. It's how we got to where we are today, with player counts dropping off a cliff, something you don't want right? You want pilots out in space with interact with, or do you not? 
---
A lesson in action folks.
---
&gt; I cant speak to how or why PL died off
---
PL has in no way "died off". It's been the same size forever, and is one of the most statistically active alliances in the game. You can spot your bullshit memes all day, it will never make them true.
---
I'm playing Albion.
---
CSM can't actually do anything, except leak NDA material.
---
Curse is fucking great, or I should say, it *can* be great. 
---
One thing we found is that you pretty quickly scrape off all the jfg anom whores. If there genuinely is a core of players who are committed to the group, you'll find out who they are quick enough. No cyno jammers. No rorqs (unless they're actually fucking insane). No rorq *saves.* No bitching about who called which anomaly first. No sov fuckery unless you feel like it.  
---
Shit, I do miss Curse.
---
Are you kidding me? You go to Disney world, while driving you pass 500 posters on the side of the road saying Disney is closed, no where is there, and it's a shit while.
---
Five. Hundred.
---
Now 1 out of every 4 signs actually says its great.
---
Your still going to Disney world? Did you really just ask for an example on the EVE subreddit of all places for an example of people discouraging play?
---
Like, open your eyes?
---
&gt;we are the most intelligent, dedicated, and organized MMO player-base on this planet
---
tips fedora
---
Of course I am you goof
---
Soilent green is bittervets.
---
You can make a passive fit that does that, but it's hard to make it have enough DPS to break the remote rep waves.
---
If you're right, what's the harm in agitating for this change?  If there's a loud enough chorus of voices asking for it and CCP still refuses to budge, it'll draw attention to CCP/PA's apparent "maintenance mode" decision and will likely tank player numbers even more rapidly and either force a change or end the farce that is EVE's continued, barely supported existence.
---
Imagine, for instance, that someone ran for the next CSM as a single-issue candidate, with that issue being the removal of all supercapital ships and excavators.  Imagine that person somehow got the highest number of votes of any candidate.  That's certainly unlikely, but it's also not impossible.  Do you see any negative possible results from that eventuality?  I don't.
---
Then it will weight a lot of bananas
---
That was actually my first idea but, you know, \*baby steps\*
---
What I saw on grid, Ark just dissapeared or teleported/jumped out with some cool effects.
---
No warping off
---
dead gaem
---
**Because the loud and repeat posters here silence the opinions of others.**
---
They downvote
---
They trashtalk
---
They shitpost
---
They want the game to stay as it is, they don't care about your fun, just theirs. 
---
**They can't see the reason why eve is where it is, is from player actions, not CCPs**
---
CCP can only respond to what they expect and to what players do. Right now, players are the ones killing the game. To argue otherwise would be foolish, so those foolish ones will just downvote and claim victory.
---
Thanks for convincing this new player to stay! 
---
I mean seriously, I gotta spell it out each time don't I?
---
I left null sec with the blobs and politics and was amazed.  I found that EvE provided me with reasons to login outside of rigid timer mechanics, to explore the depths of space and was surprised, that the world did feel dynamic and alive.
---
&gt; The part where those players try desperately to cling on to the way things used to be
---
People care about the game, and about the way it is going. If you call that desperate, then I call you a CCP bootlicker.
---
&gt;when they were the same ones pushing for the changes.
---
Yeah no, this is bullshit. The people going against the grain have been in the minority for the last few years. They've been told to "nut up or shut up", to "adapt or die" countless of times. Now that people rightfully complaining about the state of the game are starting to become the majority, it's not suddenly the case that they themselves pushed for those changes.
---
And even if they did push for those changes, do you want to say that people can't change their mind ever? Or do you want to deny that people can't always see the eventual outcome of certain decisions? This is just a really dumb take by you.
---
&gt;At some point they need to realize that being on the high school football team was great when they were 17, but it's been years since then and they need to move on or one day they'll wake up and realize high school football was the best thing they ever did because they spent all their time wishing they could still be playing on the varsity team.
---
Except no, they'll just stop playing the game and the game will be even less fun for those remaining (except the carebears). Literally a lose-lose situation. People that complain about the state of the game are just people who are passionate about the game, but slowly falling out of love with it in part as a result of CCP policy.
---
Yes, so it's not pay to win, because the benefit you get is not unique to paying more money.
---
Really simple.
---
200 LP, for 40 mins work -_- well theres no point in doing that back to Krabbing
---
Good, then I can ignore this post.
---
&gt; This is what happens when devs ignore the actions of the players and their negative effects
---
Glad we are on the same page.
---
because a few whining tosspots on reddit isn't "everyone". thank god.
---
Man I wish I could implant these exact words into every one in this subreddits brain. Nail on the head there bud
---
Undocking is Off-Topic and a bannable offense!
---
Thank you. It was important that I be told this was content otherwise I might mistake it for Into The Abyss
---
are highsec pubbie fleets always this cringey?
---
I say that your opinion cannot be changed and conversation is useless. You rant about how your opinion cannot be changed. 
---
 why would I waste my time telling you what I think about rote kapelle?
---
Do you not know what opportunity cost is? People would just shift by producing the "new" biggest ship available with the "new" best mining ship. This literally wouldn't solve anything. The current meta is due to the fact that Eve is a sandbox game. It was bound to happen eventually and no one actually knows how to fix it. If it actually was that easy, people wouldn't be throwing a million asinine ideas around that are completely different.
---
&gt;"Spam" is considered to be a repetitive display of the same text again and again in an effort to aggravate other channel patrons.
---
Two words: Jita Local
---
You were not 'in their position', your opponents didn't have literally thousands of supers and titans.
---
But also, it was bad for the game when they could ruin fights across New Eden by dropping caps everywhere, too.
---
Sure, lets run from the problem rather than trying to address it. That's why things are the way they are right now. 
---
I though you guys were elite. Stop running.
---
Thanks for that I guess?
---
 Good day to you as well o7
---
Who's obviously doesn't know anything about null ratting.
---
It takes forever to recall drones in typical nav vexor meta, orbit/speed tanking w/ oversize prop. Cutting prop so drones catch up aligning and only warping after they load gives a half ass decent hunter plenty time to intercept.
---
no head damage on those modules. doesn't look like you were trying very hard to save yourself.
---
Why would I care? As long as there are bots and idiots willing to support their idiocy ccp will never need to actually fix the game.
---
Their goal is to make the content accessible to everyone, so they have no vetting and let anyone in. So yes.
---
Screenshots of the loots please? This is just too much for me, thanks &lt;3
---
I'm fuzzy on which system too, I just know none of us had any interest in kicking you out for the obvious reasons I stated, and that the choice to go was definitely yours.
---
Good summary
---
I love me some salt
---
OP's like these are like the guy who read the first page of your 800 book and then pretend they know what it's about.
---
How do I join such an elite pve alliance?
---
Some people want to win and don't really feel like handicapping themselves for "gudfites"
---
If you can't appreciate that not everyone has the same goals as you (much like IRL, even) that's not my problem. 
---
Thanks for ur input tho, it was really insightful
---
Then you going to love it when those servers go offline 😆
---
prop???? lmfao do u even bot???
---
You wouldn't be the first person to grind themselves into an overpowered thing only to have it nerfed some time later. I believe that's common in almost every MMO.
---
We need a better reason to fly certain ships.
---
Right now, why fly a battleship when a cruiser is better? 
---
Ship roles are all over the place, usage, effectiveness, ect ect are all out of alignment. 
---
What are you more afraid of, a T2 battleship, or a T2 cruiser?
---
And that's the problem.
---
To be fair I've never been happy about even having allies...at all, ever.
---
You are in NC and getting your asses kicked in. Your idea is NOT valid
---
They're there right now, though. Why does it only work for us, as you've asserted?
---
Someone is giving CCP money to pay for the Plex dumbass 😑
---
My argument is here, at the adult table.        
---
You went here, to the kids table, to criticize my grammer without mentioning anything about my argument.
---
Please stay seated and don't play with the stove.
---
They favour the largest blob of the day - but that has been you since citadels came out, pretty much. And if your blob is enough bigger than the other ones - which in 2019 it is - you can overcome those defender-favouring mechanics.
---
Added warpout clip.
---
Hahahahaha, guys being on top for a decade didnt mean you were better....yes actually, that's exactly what it means.
---
Every time you lose a Capital, you should lose a level of JDC
---
More in line? You want it to be an orca? Define in line
---
It actually hasn't changed. It's been nerfed, even. Anyone who knows even basic sov mechanics understands this.
---
We did not get the loot. Those who did reported what they got in local chat though. One Zoryas dropped an Unstable LASB mutaplasmid and a triglavian encryption methods skillbook, and the other Zoryas dropped a Gravis ADCU mutaplasmid, and encryption methods skillbook, and a quantum engineering datacore.
---
There are definitely a lot of toxic people in EVE that turn people off from it.
---
&gt; I was in BRAVE when PL hell camped them in GE- and evicted them. Supers on the station undock and about 100 anchored bubbles covering the station so you couldn't get out with pretty much anything and just insta-popped
---
should have asset safetied lel
---
Feel free to read Vilys response, you're wrong bud, its ok
---
It means that wars are actually content for both sides, as opposed to just harassment of groups by groups that don't have a target to hit back. Eventually, with war HQ ideas (which at the natural progression from requiring a structure) you get the opportunity for actual content.
---
This is incredibly stupid. If this was a realistic number, CCP would have never been bought out by PA and before that, shareholders would lose their shit.
---
**CCP:** Bots are part of the game, just don't let the players know. Everytime they get close to figuring it out, release more ship skins
---
So, how were we supposed to defeat the enemy in 2016?
---
I have a 5 year head start on you my friend!
---
I'm going to throw out a guess based on that result that they actually did not "win" the mission
---
Let me see your killboard big boy
---
Maybe that's the "don't touch world ark, just keep farming sites" message from CCP
---
Thanks... Thats cool... How many people did you throw at it and whats the reward?
---
Gamers rise up
---
The rest of the sites are pretty garbage too though
---
Of course normally we could get with the eve community team, but they all got fired.
---
Players could get with the csm, but it’s goon dominated so they are useless
---
People could go on the official forums, but no one goes there.
---
So most folks end up on reddit bitching
---
As do courier mission bots, and salvage bots, intel bots... the list goes on.
---
&gt;So I've been told since day one that EVE is a sandbox game; it becomes what the players make it. 
---
It was never true.
---
&gt;So what's stopping other players and corps from taking action? Can it change?
---
Nothing can be done as it is almost entirely on CCP.
---
Hi NC
---
QCATS are still active? I flew with them for years back in the day when Juan was still active.
---
Nah, he forgot eve isn't League of Shit.
---
Actually pretty solid advice unless you're a super cynical player
---
Yeah, completely agree that ccp is at fault
---
Players fired the community team
---
Players introduced injectors
---
Players refuse to acknowledge excav/rorqs are op
---
Yup ccp is completely clean, locked up in their Icelandic white tower
---
Yeh but INIT is unironically bad now after letting in people like Sweaty Armpit Raiders and STK Scientific, so who knows vOv
---
Eve mirror real life in a lot of ways. Basically the rest of the world ignored a single entity while it built up its wealth and military might. Now that entity has become to large and powerful for any other single entity to do anything about it. It would take a collective effort by everything to do anything about it, but not of them can work together because they hate each other or don't trust them, so all they do is complain, waiting for someone else to do something about it.
---
T3Cs *did* get nerfed, quite hard, in their big balance a couple of years ago.
---
Gay Beagles numba won!
---
How many ships are in the game?
---
How many weapons?
---
How many systems?
---
How many careers?
---
How many story lines?
---
How many NPCs?
---
These are called content. The game is 16 years old. It didn't get there by having no content.
---
And yet somehow, nothing of value was lost.
---
before it was supers, no titans
---
before that it was dreads and carriers, not supers
---
before that it was battleships, not capitals,
---
etc. etc. list goes on - the game is old, of course you are going to begin seeing greater proliferation as EVE grows older
---
It's because there were 49 of them in fleet, providing the lowest possible payout. If they had even one more pilot there, they would've gotten no ISK at all.
---
How do you figure that?
---
god damn you are dumb as shit
---
If you don't care, why are you here?
---
So, if they were removed, then PL would be fine? What is even your point?
---
Join any alliance.
---
Do dumb shit after being told not to.
---
ah ok, got it, should have been ran with 10 people so it takes well over an hour for 8 mil per person instead
---
Project discovery bots.
---
The main issue are with bots that directly earn isk. Solve this captcha to kill the rat or deliver payload. Idk what can be done without drastically changing the game itself. Thus making it even harder than it is already to many who try it. Even knowing that it is hard. there are many who even don't try.
---
&gt;you just shittalked your own alliance and left when things got hard
---
I've literally no need to defend the effort I put in over a decade to some no name reddit guy, but to be clear, I left when the people Elise and I gave all the power to started making choices I didnt agree with culminating in a particular cocksucker placing the last straw on the camels back. 
---
Also lol, your legacy, what is that ecactly?
---
No I didnt, since I haven't been a part of that group for 8 months
---
Ohh.rorqual with no effort...interesting...
---
&gt; But I would like to say, this is all only one specific aspect of the game, pvp and regional control in low sec,
---
It may only be one aspect of the game but it is one of the more important aspect's of the game and without it a lot of the big war's that have happened in eve probably would have never happened.
---
Sadly this is probably not far off the mark
---
So years ago injectors and excavators were part of the problem with dreads and carriers years ago?
---
Yes I remember the years where a noob would go out, hit....uhh the marketplace, buy a dozen toons, put them in .....rorqs and mine up....carriers by the dozen
---
lol, what makes you so salty from a spaceship video game mate
---
Not cool when your 300 subcap fleet got dropped with 200 slowcats and the fight got shut down immediately.  And that’s basically what PL does back in 2013 and 2014, the elite way they were.
---
Fleet was around 50, with 20ish others around. 200 LP each so not much.
---
So, I assume this entity you refer to is the one with an obsession with bees. What could unify the other coalitions into working together? Would a neutral party be required to act as a diplomat between the large coalitions to help coordinate their efforts?
---
" You can't tell the players to just do that without a reason "  Really? Because Goons are glassing Tribute for a reason?
---
10 people would make it 75mil per person and 6k LP. How long that would take I do not know.
---
&gt; the difference is, NCPL doesn't have a huge victim complex
---
The fuck do you call this post then?
---
Nah, easier to quit.
---
I'll admit to never being a content creator. Pushing f1, hanging out with people I enjoyed playing with and contributing where I could in pretty miniscule amounts was about all I did. After a while though, the game just wasn't enjoyable. Loss meant nothing for me, I never fucked around with capitals really, stuck with subcaps and dabbled in cloaky bullshit. 
---
Whether it was flying 50+ jumps with another dude in a slicer or gatecamping some random pipe somewhere with friends, I had fun because I was doing it with people that I enjoyed playing with. After a while though that type of shit just gets dull. The long ass roams started to become monotonous, wouldn't see shit besides maybe a bot sporadically, those dudes I gatecamped with moved on to other things that interested them but ended up being a hard pass for me(bombing excavs as content will never be fun, sorry team). 
---
While all this was happening the game has progressively gotten worse. New features are still dropped then abandoned, blatant issues ignored. If the game company running the show doesn't care, why should I care? Obviously my few hundred dollars in subs a year doesn't hamper CCP's bottom dollar. People are still going to enjoy rorqs online I guess, hope they love it, it's just not my bag.
---
But you’re being a dumbass and condescending with everyone.  Even if you’re right you’re not gonna be well received here.  
---
The approach is not to condemn individuals in the echo chamber at face value but instead to marginalize its relative importance in the overall Eve universe.  The joe blow Eve player most likely doesn’t come to reddit.   Just play the game and who gives a fuck what most of these dudes say or think.

Realtalk: 'but sandbox' is all too common of a way of dismissing concerns about the game. Just because something is a sandbox doesn't mean it doesn't have rules, it just means that it is intended as a freeform player-directed environment rather than a guided themepark one. (Even the 'ultimate' sandbox - real life - still has rules in the form of the laws of physics.) In fact, *any* system *must* have rules, sandboxes included. The rules of the sandbox dictate what is and is not possible for players to do, and govern what happens in response to any given player action and how the different elements of the sandbox interact with each other.
---
Why is this important? Because the rules of the sandbox control how successful/optimal any given action/strategy is going to be. Sure, nothing is stopping groups of players from going to war with the large coalitions, in the sense that it is obviously physically possible in the game. However, just because it's *possible*, doesn't mean it's *viable*. The rules of the sandbox don't make playstyles other than the current meta of allied blocs of giant industrial powerhouse coalitions (the proverbial blue donut) literally *impossible*, but they do dictate that such playstyles are less optimal by enough of a margin that they cannot compete. And this is eve - the game where the credo of player competition is, and has always been, 'win by any means necessary'. Any entity which wants to 'win' *must* play optimally, because if they do not they will inevitably lose to those that do. Even if 'the playerbase', which in this case would actually mean 'the leadership of all the large coalitions', collectively chose to play sub-optimally in order to 'fix' the game, it still wouldn't accomplish anything, because they would simply then fall to the next group to come along that *did* choose to play optimally - and there will always be such a group.
---
In a nutshell, the problem is that the architecture of the sandbox currently dictates that one particular strategy of play is much more optimal than others, and said strategy happens to be one that leads to a particularly boring overall meta. It is not possible for 'the players' to redress this on their own, because the meta is the meta for a *reason* - trying to play against the meta simply gets you turfed out by those who don't.
---
&gt; You want to use a combination of NPC Kills &amp; NPC Delta.
---
If I looked exclusively at NPC Kills I may see 100 on dotlan in one system and not want to bother with it because there are other systems with 400-500. However if I look at delta, it may show the system with 100 is +100 delta, meaning it's all relatively fresh, while the systems with 400-500 could have -300 delta, meaning the ratting is winding down and over. I want to go where the ratting is ramping up.
---
Another reason why is if the ratting numbers are massive, like a delta of ~+1500-2000, it may be a super and my group isn't capable of pinging and killing one of those yet. Like I said, it's a combination of both that I use.
---
Oh look its The Judges alt acc
---
Man you guys and your litany of reasons why this game will die.  
---
I agree the people congregate and spread info - ccp should probably stick to their official communication tools.  But to be fair, ccp really does suck ass at communicating, with brisc-gate being the most obvious recent example.
---
Post on Reddit expecting other people to do the un fun parts for them?
---
Botting has been around forever in EVE, but the extent at which it exists now is unprecedented.
---
Someone else giving CCP is NOT the same as the OP giving CCP money.
---
Two reasons.
---
A) Complaining is easier.
---
2) Goonswarm Federation's steadfast refusal to pull its punches fosters feelings of learned helplessness, which extinguish any and all forms of gumption in most of the players who, in the past, have been able to coast for the better part of two decades on a static accomplishment in the youth of their gameplay.
---
reloading and neuted out :S
---
&gt;Do you not know what opportunity cost is?
---
You haven't actually used the concept of opportunity cost anywhere in your post, which makes me think you may not know what it means.
---
&gt;People would just shift by producing the "new" biggest ship available with the "new" best mining ship. 
---
Yes, which would be what?  Carriers/Dreads/Faxes and Orcas?  Every 100-to-300-man FW alliance I've ever been a part of could have put half of their members into Carriers/Dreads on one month's notice, and almost all within six months, if there'd ever been a point.  More importantly, we could have afforded to lose all of those ships a couple of times.  Unfortunately, thanks to unkillable supercap umbrellas, there has never been a point to fielding capital fleets--all it does is make you a target for the unkillable supercap umbrella(s).  If blocs had to form 100+ capitals to safely dunk on smaller groups, rather than the current meta where they have to form 5-20 supers, it would happen a hell of a lot less.  
---
If supercaps disappeared, suddenly the playing field would be dramatically more even because everyone, or nearly everyone, would have access to the top tier of ships in numbers that would make them practically useful.  
---
&gt;The current meta is due to the fact that Eve is a sandbox game and people like to complete long term goals. 
---
It's also due to CCP creating supers and Titans with the idea in mind that they would be the be-all-end-all ships that would never exist in large numbers, but rather would be the centerpieces of much larger fleets of subcaps.  I'm not blaming players for wanting Titans/Supers.  I'm blaming CCP for putting them in the game and saying that those players' happiness is an acceptable sacrifice to save the game.
---
&gt;If it actually was that easy, people wouldn't be throwing a million asinine ideas around that are completely different.
---
This is a logical fallacy.  That's like saying that if people knew how to solve polio there wouldn't be a million different homeopathic vaccine alternatives being peddled.
---
?  What do we want?  I'm not sure what I'd be boycotting.  That some bittervet should be more accommodated?
---
Why are we doing this?
---
In WWB, you mean? In the short term, you probably couldn't, and didn't. But there are two big differences between that and today.
---
First, your enemy was a cobbled together group of people who were only brought together by money or to kick you. You could play the long diplomatic game and break up the enemy. That is not really possible for your opponents today, as even if Goons could be split from all its allies, it's still big enough to be a problem.
---
And second, they did not have anything close to the 'Fortress Delve' of today, because many of the game mechanics that promote a super-safe umbrella and near-infinite ISK and material generation weren't present. So you could also play the long game economically and catch up in a reasonable time, which again isn't really possible today.
---
Whats the best amount of pilots for the best amount of payout?
---
always use heat before you realize you should have used heat. nanite is cheap and tethering repairs for free!
---
you know, that might just work. You should try and get hold of some big alliance diplomats and try pull them together to do something.
---
Fair enough. But the whole idea of a timer adding legitimacy is stupid. I guess all the dead fleets don't count either?
---
Just put all the panfam losses into a panfam bucket. Put all the imperium losses into an imperium bucket.
---
Because a blanket removal of those is literally taking sand out of the sandbox. It's the same reason people are mad that combat interceptors were made absolutely useless
---
I'm very thankful I wasn't aware of the existence of EVE related forums when I began playing.
---
Do you lack reading comprehension skills? I said "enjoy the high while it last". I never said anything about regretting the time I put into the game. I would do it all over again if I could and if things change, I see myself coming back one day.
---

---
You know, he’s right.
---
So you're saying CCP should never remove anything from the game, no matter how negative the consequences of it's inclusion?   
---
I'd say this is more like scooping dog shit out of the sandbox.  Sure, some kids like playing with the dog shit too, but that doesn't mean the people maintaining the sandbox should let them.
---
Now that's an idea, our exchange cert expired a few weeks ago, didn't really break email for everyone, just no body understood how to press 'ok'.
---
Definitely brining up the idea at work tomorrow
---
You forget how feverish the anti-GSF sentiment was back in 2016. There was no diplomatic option. Any time we showed up, the band forged immediately back together to repel us. 
---
Also, how the fuck do you "play the long game economically" against opponents with limitless casino funds, and with no moons or space of your own?
---
Neither of these options were feasible or realistic. Got any others?
---
Content is determined by PVP.
---
You think EVE would live long as a single player game?
---
&gt;These are called content. The game is 16 years old. It didn't get there by having no content.
---
It had PVP, now it doesnt. CCP got rid of it.
---
&gt; thinks they're special and already wants to tell everyone else how to think, play, and feel about the game
---
So the common pvp poster on this subreddit? Cool, archived.
---
There are plenty of reasons but lets just take concurrent player decline (approx. 1/3) as a starting point. The goal is to stop the complacency, and convince them that the golden goose can be killed if they don't take steps to prevent it.
---
Imagine being able to nerf things but not literally delete them
---
These ships have been in the game for years and years and years, their mere existence is not the primary issue here
---
to be fair, this subreddit has always been a place of bittervet shitposting, elitism, mockery, and bragging. It can be fun to read when you're settled in, but if you're new to eve, you're making a real mistake coming here for helpful info
---
Yes, players came her with piss poor attitudes. CCP had nothing to do with shaping that over the last 15 years.
---
It isn't us. It's CCP leadership. You're new here. You'll learn someday.
---
If people don't enjoy playing the game anymore... quit.  Its a game after all.
---
When my subscription ended I had the choice; subscribe again or quit.. since to get fun out of this computer game took way too much time I decided to take the 2nd option.  Both accounts expired; I am still floating in space in a mach.  If CCP want my £££ back they have to invest in  making the game fun.   
---
The people that say its a sandbox; I really don't understand.  Indeed its a 'sandbox'; but its also a game where CCP control the mechanics / balance, (if CCP made the ibis one shot a titan.. it still a sandbox....  so what?) ...  In my opinion CCP neglected the little fish in the sea; those players have stopped playing and now the big fish have nothing to do.  Its a real shame .. nothing else is out there quite like eve; great idea just really shitty implementation, balance passes and direction from CCP.
---
The steps CCP need to do to make the game more fun.. (i.e. pvp orientated) ; I highly doubt CCP has the stomach for.  Players in this game hate losing... they like other people losing though.  Similar to nullsec being dangerous... they like the idea of it being risky.. just not for them.... so meh.
---
Who's to blame... CCP and the players.
---
The other guy had you. Do you not read usernames? :/
---
EVE reddit has made me a bit skeptical. You're not saying this with sarcasm, are you?
---
That would explain its appaling taste which is way too salty and bitter for humans to enjoy.
---
Intelligence isn't one of your strong suits ehh? Then again you're defending eve 2019 so no need to answer...
---
CCP probably shouln't have fired the community team
---
CCP should have drastically lowered the ore spawn rates to keep rorquals from camping one system and mining forever, rather than just nerfing both the ship and the drones. 
---
Solutions exist to problems, but we don't get the solutions that help everyone, do we?
---
All that salt and me with no French fries :smugdon:
---
It was carriers and afk ratting back then, not rorquals and mining
---
Yea, the players made it so theres only one viable play style anymore, the players introduced the injectors that put the meta and balance completely out of whack, the players definitely took all the rewards out of fighting a war by making every region exactly the same resource wise and it was most definitely the players who coded citadels to be such aids.
---
Glad you're in tune with the game
---
Fuck. -2 for me today
---
Delve hours lost: 40!!!!! ... Like cmoooon, are u that desperate for boosting morale of PANFAM. We've spent more on fuel for move opd.
---
Hey kid. You seem nice. So one advice: FUCK OFF!
---
Anyways, now lemme explain the situation to your virgin self. We like the negativity. We thrive in it. No other game exists like eve because of us. You think the devs don't know this? We love them and we love the game. Because we look so neckbeardy and rude to the outside world, but the game is full of amazing people. People which you'll never find in any other game. And that's the real magic here.
---
And you, you fucking little shit, are coming to our platform, playing our game, and then shitting on our salt mine and telling us to discard this magical shit? Fuck no you whiny bitch. Go to r/pics or something and look at pets. Cause that's what you identify as, a fucking whiny bitchy pet.
---
Good joke :) but my post is serious :)
---
FFS, they've tried rebalancing supercapitals over and over, and have never come close to achieving a good balance.  At what point do we give up and just remove them?  How many more attempts do we make while watching null stagnate and the PCU count dwindle.
---
Also, any nerf that actually balanced supercapital ships (i.e. made it possible to kill them without either your own supers or a dramatically larger number of regular caps) would make their owners even angrier than just removing the ships and compensating them.  Do you have any balance suggestions that you feel would solve the obvious problems of supers without causing as much rage as removing them?
---
Is it in k space? If so where?
---
[https://www.eveonline.com/article/ptbcji](https://www.eveonline.com/article/ptbcji) but look at these cool skins... and there you are complaining about balance...
---
Link the killmail

Oh r/eve the vocal minority of the playerbase.
---
They already got a big nerf!
---
He is

It brings attention to the issue, and my condescension and being a dumbass probably caused this post to get quadruple the coverage it normally would have.
---
So, yes, maybe it would help, but if all of 6 people see it its much less effective

Sorry, I thought we were playing conversational consequences

Wow, way to ball up the vocal minority with the rest of the playerbase.

Unchecked player behavior is the term you are looking for. 
---
You want fun agression? Make it harder to leave a fight. Stop allowing people to warp away at a moments notice. But that change will never come, instead we'll just get mods that prohibit movement while the pvper has no restrictions. 
---
Then suddenly one day, there's no one out to pvp against. So we post on reddit that mechanics are bad but just the ones about krabbing, turtling and it's to hard to be a pvp player. 
---
This is your hole that you pvp only focused pilots dug. Filling it with tears isn't going to do anything.
---
Where do you get those numbers?
---
If I could only afford gold, you'd have it.
---
yes?
---
Top tier salt. Imagine how mad this guy was when making this lmao
---
&gt; When was the universe this small?
---
When force projection, mostly capital related, didn't allow you to cross the galaxy during a commercial tv break.
---
&gt; Yeah but PL didn't have the economic capability to make any losses they did take completely meaningless. 
---
So, PL was bad? Okay, I don't see how this relates to anything, besides making PL look incompetent.
---
Or in the case of BBTB, both.

Toxicity is standard here. Learn to enjoy grown men cry like SJW-teenagers about how the world should be.

---
You're a fucking moron if you ignored the repeated claims by almost anyone of importance in the mbc saying after wwb they would reset.
---
Wwb ended. They reset. People fought each other. Now you're calling it seal clubbing and backstabbing and whatever other dumbfuck shit people claim it to be on this subreddit.
---
I get it, you've bought into the Test victim narrative. Whether a member or not, you're towing that line pretty well, but it also makes it clear to me that the doctor didn't unwrap the umbilical cord from around your throat fast enough when you were ejected from the gaping hole you spawned from.
---
You clearly don't know who the toon is then.
---
I can’t even bear that. I rat about four times a year for three hours just to remind myself that it is as depressing as hell.

Ah yes, those contemptible pvp players, why are they even playing Eve amirite?
---
Show me on the rorqual where test touched you
---
Allan, Allan!
---
Every post you make just gets dumber dude. Might be time to take a break. It's not healthy to get this upset over a video game.

No ;D

Will you be needing, perhaps, a dinner reservation?

We do. He’s nothing but a rage boner against test.  All Volta is, is one content fleet after another after another into null for the sake of killing miners and ratters.  They might be just a shade above CODE in the overall sphere of actual content generated.
---
That I can't argue with, yeah. I just wish some null alliance would come fuck us up. I haven't been truly rawdogged since I was in brave in 2014.

Look at that! You grew two hairs on your chest.

Now this attitude will get you much much further. Aye, quite far.

Expect mining barges to get buffed soon.

The fuck is this shit ?

GOTG were reset by NC and PL around one to one month and a half ago, when it was clearly said they would be siding with goons.
---
Sortdragon choose his alliance over the coalition, and fucked over Horde that went badshit and invaded them. 
---
And lol@"NCPL don't know how to use superz§§§" when every other alliance in the game is worse. Pure Blind what lost purely on numbers.
---
upset? 
---
Imagine living in a bubble where everyone that disagrees with you is upset. 
---
Maybe you should go outside more, there is a world outside your moms basement you know
---
years of experience have taught the playerbase that you have to be as toxic and annoying as possible and probably stop sinking money for a few months to make ccp think about what the community says.
---
It's sad, but it was proven many times during the last years. 
---
I am sorry for potential newbies that might quit because a bit of reddit heat happening outside of the actual game is too much for them, but unless ccp start to actually care about their game I can just say, deal with it or look for game like farmville....

why would i downvote a video. I like this banter and propaganda crap in eve. Even if it is from the enemy.
---
That's not what the pvp players think. They only want burst damage and a way to escape/cloak immediately upon sensing a possible lossmail.
---
Would be better if we shoot the broken stuff in jita.at least we can have more people react.
---
The problem with rorqs isn't raw profitability, it's scalability, both in terms of individual players multiboxing and large entities stacking them under an umbrella.  I think most people who complain about rorqs would be fine with tripling or quadrupling their current yield in return for excavators getting "fighter mechanics" or something similar and nerfing the counterdrop (inhib buffs, for instance).
---
And all then titan an super pilot's now in subs, dreads, carrier or fax's arnt gonna be cancer off out numbering every one with carrier dread or just pure sub cab blobs.
---
Give capital strip miners.
---
&gt; that reason still exists for new players. 
---
you literally have not the slightest bit of a clue what eve once was, what it offered.
---
Grouping drones would go a long way to solving some issues.

As would taking drones away from ships that have no business using them.

Oh man, if only Doink hadn't taken a shit on Kugu's archives I would bury you under a mountain of Goon tears claiming exactly what you say they never claimed.

Seems like we get nothing from ccp, and a bunch of monkeys here on reddit screaming “Reeeeerr”
---
put a load of bots in your opponents alliances to drop their sov.
---
Uploaded them [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uBcS43bhaPSlvM5dOoy0g_rx55ugOtBX5Lfmj_Oj2Us/edit#gid=0), extracted from client files, probably for showing in agency etc similar to how incursions are (or used to be, not sure where they are now).
---
Yes cause this is what exactly would happen. You do nothing till help arrives and then brag...
---
Try more scrams.
---
People are pisses because its CCPs game to lose. They have a die hard player base but are held up by major dogma at their studio. 
---
Many people dont want to see a decade plus of gaming go poof because the dev team cant get their act together non stop.
---
well that wasnt what i expected at all
---
If an alliance is so big it can't identify a cloud of 4 day old random-character-name VNI bots, it deserves to be busted up.
---
&gt; You do the sandbox aspect of this game a diservice by lumping it all into broken game mecánicos 
---
the sandbox is dead, you detailed that yourself, there is now ONE viable playstyle in eve, thats not a sand box, and thats down to broken mechanics.
---
JFYI a sandbox has more than one way to be played, EVE no longer does, so EVE is no longer a sand box.
---
So for those hoping to FIGHT the world ark, that is not the case.  
---
At least not yet. You need to kill all the pylons it drops and the ships and spawn; including a new NPC.  
---
Then the World Ark will portal it's self out. It's a sight to see.  
---
You can shoot the World Ark, after a 200 SECOND LOCK TIME. This will have 0 effect.  
---
The first one has run, I had the privilege to FC the fleet that took it out.
---
I think a balance can be struck by giving subcaps a key role in cap warfare - by giving caps weak spots that only subcaps can exploit. If done right you'd have a balanced ecosystem where caps are only part of the equation and subs have an important role to play when they hit grid.
---
warping off before mr 45 second scanning time manage to find a VNI mean it's a bot, yeah sure, why not
---
&gt; Also, how the fuck do you "play the long game economically" against opponents with limitless rorqual funds
---
No i am talking about rorqs sporting 20k dps tanks which is similar to a fax in triage, which would be fine if not for the fact that faxes have ~13k m³ for cap charges, rorqs have ~80k m³ .  
---
Cap charges = difference between life and death. Rorqs can fit dual tanks of one ancillary + one standard shield booster.  
---
That pushes the tank towards ~50k dps repaired for short times. 
---
Have i mentioned that our mining platform has a crazy amount of highslots? If you discount Cyno, Indy Core and PANIC you have 5 utility slots for pretty much any config you could wish for? Need neuts? Fit neuts! Need boosts? Fit Boosts! Need Shield Reps?...  
---
For reference: carriers get 4 "utility" high slots after NSA, Dreads get only one!
---
Oh but it gets better. Our apex asteroid predator is featuring a whooping 8800m³ drone bay. Minus 5 excavators and we are looking at 3300m³ of spare drone bay for all kinds of nasty shit to make unwanted guests leave.  
---
Your generous slot layout also allows you to refit to drone navigation comps/ drone links should your guests provide to be slippery and hard to hit.  
---
Because you are a smart player you might even decide to refit to 1-2 DDAs because you don't really need those lowslots anyways as your powergrid/cpu is very comfy at 1200k/600k.
---
All of that is before 4 minutes of invulnerability for you and all your subcap fleet buddies. Which btw can be chained if you have multiple rorqs. Amazing!
---
Now scale all of that up to at a minimum of 2-3 rorqs sitting in an anom/moon ore at any given time, and with a bit of empathy you will realise why it's such aids to fight for smallgang groups.  
---
And it doesn't just come down to bUt ItS a CaPiTaL considering that an unsupported ratting carrier will die to the same small gang groups that bite their teeth out on a lonely rorq.
---
which bucket do I shit in?
---
i have no idea why hilmar isnt using this to get his devs in high gear.
---
Imagine having goons live this rent free in your head
---
&gt; We all think the GTFO module was one of the dumbest things ever added to the game. 
---
The only people who complain about this module is TEST, because Progod got fucked by it
---
cos it's fucking aids mate. nobody wants to kill raitardus at 4am on a Wednesday. ccp need to fix the mechanics, because they made it this way in the face of criticism.
---
yeah cos pvpers warping off is way less prevalent than say, VNIs lol
---
welcome to hisec
---
You're so far from the truth that hurts
---
You sound like a tree hugger asking everyone to hold hands.
---
CCP is incredibly lazy and self centered bc they have no competition; Eve is the only game in town.
---
On top of that, Eve is a game where groups of thousands of people square off over years, putting in hundreds of hours, and eventually someone loses.  Do you really think opponents are going to kiss and make up on Reddit?!
---
People feel they way they feel for a reason
---
The CPU and PG differences are both a 20% increase in-game, which makes me think that there's a skill difference between your character in-game and the character you've got in PYFA, further supported by the red book icon in the upper right of the PYFA window.  (As a note, 20% for would be level 4 for both Power Grid Management and CPU Management).
---
Try updating your characters' skills in PYFA (via the API) and see if that fixes it.
---
&gt; Neither of these options were feasible or realistic
---
I mean they're literally what you did over the 12-18 months after the war finished so they clearly were
---
Will still be relevant in 10 years.
---
The idea is a significant timer adds opportunity to defend on a larger scale. If one chooses not to defend does not negate one having the option.
---
this is what devolved in my last alliance - freeform activity outside of the usual big fleets (which consisted of either 300man fozzy sov defense, some type of medium subcap fleet that wasnt a blueball 10% of the time, or defending the anchoring of a bait raitaru) was bombing excavator drones - which does nothing but numbers on a zkill. 
---
Roaming got down to basically killing botters. Tried to do smallgang fleets and it became avoid the cyno highway and get 50 dudes on your ass.
---
theres truly no reason for smalltime stuff, which arguably can be the most interactive and fun parts of eve.
---
so i moved to lowsec which is definitely better, but so many went the route of quitting altogether even that type of route has way to many deadspells
---
explain the munin for us plebs
---
 It would have come months later after the strain got to be too much, you know, like the other times they were shot.
---
In your own words you’ve explained why Brave left when they did, you were farming too frequently and without even the slightest hope of growth of any kind under the circumstances.  It may not have been your intention to destroy smaller groups, but it did force them to choose between independence, or becoming part of a larger pastry.
---
Aside from the frustration of fighting against PL’s every present ability to press the Iwin button and drop Supers, I always had fun living and fighting on the edge of existence since Catch 1.0.
---
I don’t think PL is responsible for the Blue Donut, but they definitely drove Brave towards the safety of a larger herd.  I think skill Injectors and Rorq mining are more to blame for changing the way the game is played, this used to be a game where the skill to field an apex force like NC/PL’s took years of training and grinding. 
---
I blame CCP for destroying the value of the years everyone put into this game before the monetization of skillpoints.
---
&gt; two hairs on _your_ chest
---
They actually just died after reading your retarded comment with incorrect grammar usage. Your first lossmail I guess.
---
you want fun aggression? Make it harder to instantly respond with overwhelming force by idk like removing jump drives from all caps except jump freighters
---
&gt;tethering repairs heat dmg
---
so... i didn't knew that...
---
Shame....
---
I'll rephrase as well.  Blaming the player base has negative consequences, to you and any goals you want to accomplish.  When someone is butt hurt, trying to tell them that its there own fault doesn't really work. 
---
CCP will be fine.  Everyone that wins EVE can be replaced.
---
Log in.
---
Hehe darn. Ty for this , i'll try to be there on time.
---
Im pretty sure in Wow a warlock can create a portal to get his friends to him
---
Would be pretty boring to have 50 people go afk and cloak lol
---
Local chat only showing your name when you make an entry and people actually using in game mechanics like dscan, camps and probes for intel.
---
These are easily verifiable facts. So, then, what changed?
---
So it didn't die then
---
Dude you wrote me a two paragraph copy pasta that I now have permanently saved and plan to reuse as much as possible.
---
Taking is not doing you favors man. Me however, your doing me wonders
---
nobody who does anything interesting in this game thinks the current structure mechanics are good. talk to any of your FCs and ask them what they think about citadel mechanics.
---
it's not just a vocal minority. timer grind and tz tank is real like never before. the game is bad, and whether people are on the winning or losing side of x conflict, they're walking away.
---
I think there might be a flaw in your logic. Goons said they are just going to leave Tribute when done. CCP didn't do a thing and there is wide scale war in the East.
---
Those are my favorite to laugh at.
---
CCP was headed down this path long before Pearl Abyss bought them. It's a fundamental leadership problem the company has had for the last 10 years refusing to invest in the only successful game they've ever made.
---
Well I'm equipping a ship scanner to catch the dirty bastards with cloaks!!! LOL
---
Injector farms aren't profitable anymore. It can almost cover the cost of plex, but not quite.
---
\&gt;:D
---
So its not that they are steam rolling.  But how they are steam rolling.  Fire is fire to me but, grrrrr goons using subcaps
---
the most important question  
---
What was the reward
---
jesus querns, give it a break. the mechanics are shit and any goon who has actually gone on a fleet in the last month knows it.
---
You are looking at EvE like there is some kind of linear progression requiring completion of specific tasks to move to the next stage. That isn't how EvE works. You can jump into "end game" content near instantly. Nothing is stopping you from fighting in a battle with the highest SP players in the game. Nothing is stopping you from using a rookie ship in a titan battle. Nothing is stopping you from experiencing the same exact issues that those players are experiencing. You are not protected form it just because you think it will take a while to get there. This game isn't WoW. There are new player farm alliances for a reason. Having a bunch of new player frigates flying around tackling is effective. Just because those players don't know or understand what is going on around them doesn't mean those issues do not exist.  
---
You also do not know about the history of EvE where there have been issues with CCPs changes and it took the players bitching and moaning non stop to get them to fix it. EvE, at one time, was a game that actually listened to its players.
---
Should you stop playing? No. Should you stop telling people who know better to bury their heads in the sand? Yup.
---
But mining is boring as fuck, quite literally the opposite of fun, surely in this sandbox theres more than one way to competitively play right?
---
It'll also repair the drones in ur drone bay.
---
Post of the month
---
no skill loss will lead to problem that everybody will fly them everywhere
---
You're right. Also there's many skills that you need to bring to lvl 5 that are useless for other ships. Rorquals are powerful, but given the isk and skills investment, it's absolutely in the right spot.
---
Yep, they've been resurrected under the leadership of GoingOffRoading. Solid dude, and has them back living in Nisuwa.
---
Or drop on titans going back to staging
---
If the Triglavians really want to have fun, they drop a World Ark in Jita.
---
As i replied to you 5 times before, citadels. But you absolutely refuse to acknowledge their effect on the game.
---
None of what you're saying is wrong, I'm just not having this narrative where PL "kicked" brave and test out of the north because thats not what happened.
---
They definitely got leaned on too hard, and moving away was definitely the sane choice, however theres a huge difference between making the healthy choice and moving, and being forcefully removed from space.
---
Australians in Tactical Supremacy
---
Ah, thank you for illustrating point #1.
---
Let me tell you about some other aspects. 
---
High sec mission running, high sec production, lowsec production, incursions. A few examples of pve/industry activities that still can make kinda fun when you are really looking for the exact specific gameplay they provide.
---
But when you look at them from an economical perspective, none of them make sense anymore since overpowered rorquals and titan ratting get you such a high income that you basically waste your time with anything else.
---
Supercapital Hunting was a thing a few years ago. Now it is completely dead since everybody who is not really drunk or a complete retard uses citadels or even keepstars to move supers.
---
Gatecamps have become a waste of time since nobody travels in anything else than instawarp ceptors or nullified t3 cruisers. 
---
Small or midscale roams are basically dead since capitals or even supercapitals are dropped on frigates.
---
The only thing that didn't get significantly worse during the last few years ( at least as far as I heard about it ) is wormhole gameplay.
---
So don't. Provide an environment for others to do so.
---
Yeah, my last run wasn't my best for sure, but it just became increasingly apparent to me that the game I enjoyed was gone.
---
good for them
---
The thorax hull has grown on me and it bothered me less when i figured out one side was the drone bay
---
uh-huh. :D
---
a few FCs don't make a majority.
---
That's about of words for someone who didn't fully read the post. No one said go pound said and leave CCP alone. I suggest in the future spending more time reading the post than typing a reply
---
Which messed with the economy somewhat. But now we have injectors breaking characters/skills. And rorquals/excavators breaking t1 minerals
---
So saying “the last 12 years are the same as this year...” is not an entirely accurate statement is it?
---
I used to feel the exact same way, but after getting about 30mil SP in I'd give it a 51/49 percent split with the majority going to CCP.  Why CCP?  Because they're actually in charge.
---
They did exactly that, and unless ive been reading some other sub reddit Goons are saying that wasn't the right choice, that rental empires were bad, even though those provided exactly what you're saying.
---
Not only that but they're also extremely weak in comparison to "indy grinding" in EVE, so there ISN'T more than one viable playstyle, theres the one that works, and a bunch that are shit compared to it.
---
You said that us fleeing the north worked out because mechanics changed. Citadels were introduced in April of 2016, and we exited in July of 2016. So, no, they're not valid in the timescale we're talking about. Try again, bucko.
---
Because you, in your prime, can build an impenetrable fortress region, while they, in their prime could not. It's not about the *current* situation, it's about the relative power to contemporary opponents. You are more powerful compared to everyone else now than PL. was compared to everyone then.
---
Deeper than what you posted.
---
Many of those are called alpha vni botters :P
---
Those don't need to inject, nor buy a sub anymore.. and if they get fragged, they just reroll more
---
He’s just assimilating to this subreddit.
---
I don't care what the percentage is for CCP, if you read the post my issue is not with CCP or there impact on the game. My issue lies with the player base and the players impact on the game. This distinction is important. Please see the purpose of the post after removing CCP as a factor, because in this instance, in this conversation, it is not the factor at hand.
---
Cool, also, you wouldn't know someone by the name of Tanaka Atsuko right? :P
---
Well, then, I'm thankful for the changes in game mechanics that are wrapped in a big "if (alliance == 'goonswarm federation') {" statement, and that they could never apply to anyone else, ever. I'm sure that we'll just spend 12 to 18 months sitting on anyone else who tries. This is a sane thing to think.
---
So you think the thing is fine?
---
I should probably throw the meme super weapons in this category too.
---
Ah okay.
---
Thanks for this.
---
Now I know you're just blatantly lying. Good luck querns.
---
When you care too much of killboard when you add a fucking deimos lol! The only one that were pvping.
---
Another retarded idea
---
I almost wonder if server stability was a silent killer. Back in the day it was pointless fielding a few thousand people because the server would just die lmao.
---
Rental empires are the opposite of what I'm talking about.
---
Laughed harder than I should have.
---
Hmmm... I multi box pretty heavily (multiple clients) and I have no problem on max settings.... I know this doesn’t help you at all though.... lowering your textures and extraneous effects should help out. Most of the time I play pretty zoomed out unless I need a better perspective for manual piloting. So low textures shouldn’t degrade the experience to much.. [old post but probably still relevant ](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/topic/238222/) good luck, I would just play around with settings for a bit
---
LMAO. Lying about what?
---
At least he elaborated on what he was upset about.
---
Are you being a cunt because you think he was being a cunt?  
---
Are you being a cunt because you feel personally attacked by his criticism?  
---
Are you being a cunt because you are just a cunt normally?

Please elaborate.  Would actually add to the conversation.

Hi, YoureMyDogBlue!

You might not be aware of it but ccp posting in this sub is a fairly recent thing, i wanna say 2014/15 ish.  
---
I am way happier with ccp posting here occasionally, it's often the only sign that they are still alive and working on something i guess.  
---
You might not want this to be the reality but this sub pretty much *is* the eve community with the diversity of groups that post here.
---
The eve is dead withing 6 months thing was more in regard to the quality of feedback given on the official forums more so than a comment on the current state of affairs.
---
I'm only wrong when you have a false memory of what actually happened in Fade. But it's fine, I don't expect you to be in touch with reality.
---
They couldn't? So what was the N3 rental super-region if not an impenetrable fortress?
---
That's a lot of work put into this.
---
I have to ask
---
Y Tho?
---
Ewww Ponywaffe...
---
I know little about them. Are they available 24/7?  Were they available at the time of these kills?  Were they instructed to save these ships or just structures? Please give us Intel.
---
Stop it! Stop it! You're ruining the narrative! NC is *ELITE*
---
So you're saying Vily is wrong too?
---
I actually enjoyed the game, yet quit anyways because of people like you, and the gut feeling (probably wrong) that CCP doesn't care.
---
WE KNOW THAT IT IS 2.5MILION /H                    
---
I guess person responsible for "resource wars" payouts balanced also this part.         
---
Like resource wars were fine in their mininsh kind of way - only issue was that you were losing isk by doing this PVE activity.          
---
Why CCP just not added something unique to LP stores ... i still don't get it idea behind this.
---
That one makes sense, and isn't bad, unlike the banana with a kickstand that is the imicus.
---
and nothing of value was lost.
---
Lol you are typing a lot of words for someone who doesn't even have  a basic understanding of how the game works but that doesn't seem to be stopping you.
---
I see no punishment for dying in 'really strong' caps or supercaps. Why should subcaps be any different?

Says the person who has yet to make a valid point in the entire thread. I told you hours ago you were only embarrassing yourself, and yet here you are, still at it.
---
You have no clue about why players are leaving. None.  You are projecting your own insecurities onto us, trying to make it be our fault you are not achieving what you wish to in life. I say this with all sincerity, you need to seek a therapist.
---
Just disband CVA ... that will show 'em.
---
&gt;Provide an environment for others to do so
---
That is exactly what rental space does.  To be clear, most people in PL/NC don't like mining, its not fun, at all, for any of them, its boring.  
---
If mining is the only way to play eve, that means the sand box is dead, its no longer a sand box, its a linear progression game.
---
GGWP!
---
Recycling jokes ain’t much but it’s honest work.

Oh and

&gt;YOUR GAME IS AMAZING. NOW SHUT THE FUCK UP AND STOP RUNNING PEOPLE OFF LIKE MYSELF.

I've applied twice for this.  Lifelong community manager, multiple forums thrived under me, non-profit experience, software developer experience, customer service expert...literally everything that post asks for...didn't even get a phone call or consideration, so please stop pretending like you have any intention of actually filling this position.
---
It doesn't actually do any damage, its just hilarious, all the other AOE shit is dumb as hell though for sure.  Nobody asked for any of that shit, in fact years ago we staged a big thing to get AOE weapons completely removed and then like magic CCP was like oh hey, we know you hated that one, but heres 148904 more, hope things work out ok.
---
You're a joke.
---
I can't believe you still have a job.
---
No. Providing an environment means safeguarding that environment at both the small gang and sov warfare level. It also involves building extensive infrastructure, far beyond a few JF mids. Renters are never protected when they krab.
---
Long since past time for Falcon to be shown the door.
---
You're living in the wrong part of the galaxy, mate. People meme drop titans nowadays. Also, did you hear about people multiboxing ratting titans?
---
If you carry depot and refits, you can fit application and dps mods and volley 1 RR cruiser before your shields hit even 50%. Solo rattles are surprisingly speedy at C4s if you have refits
---
Thank you.  I hope people read this
---
Ok, then this thing counts as a indestructible structure. What is the new NPC people talking about? My guess would be the Zorya officer drops will come from these sites. Maximum fleet size for payout is 30 or less?
---
I remember those days, Brave were drama central. Reddit was nuts back then.
---
The only thing I would like to see is a triglavian bomber, but seems kinda weird to make work lore wise given their normal weapons.
---
and yet so much was gained
---
not spending time around toxic assholes like you leaves me time to leave the house and hang out with friends.  it's crazy how much better life is outside of new eden
---
you have my sword..
---
shhh, he's in VIC, just smile and nod
---
Dude you have seriously got to stop doing that. You have brought up therapists so many times, and personal issues and this and that. Not one person is here talking about mental disorders, personality issues, learning disabilities, nobody except you. You keep bringing it up. And then, of all the possible things you could say, you tell me I'm protecting. You have brought up issues only you see that have nothing to do with anything and then told me I'm projecting.
---
Do you have any idea how bad of an impression you give? If you have issues, that's fine, but telling people who have literally not said a word that could be misinterpreted as mental illness that they are sick is getting old. You don't have a medical degree do you? And no, since you very clearly do in fact see a therapist, that weekly meeting doesn't give you the right to throw out medical knowledge you don't have. 
---
Telling someone to see a therapist is not an argument winner. If you would like, I'll send you to my sister, who is a licensed psychologist with a masters. Someone who, you know, can actually comment on whether or not someone should see a therapist an interview and not just reading a comment or 2 on reddit.
---
I see your point and was offering mine.  Hope you dont think your original post was confusing, it's very clear.  
---
If you check my history of shitposting on /r/eve you'll see I have beef with CCP.  I should just let it go, but it's not gonna happen
---
That’s like your opinion man
---
What happened to project Nova? The fps game based on Eve.
---
so much better outside of eve that you're on here whining like a bitch.
---
sounds like you're just trying to convince yourself. if you don't like the game and don't want to play, then don't. you don't need to whine to me about it.
---
I love the detail with the middle managment dino on the balloons. Good work!
---
This comment isn't relevant and will be ignored. I'll come back to it though once you read the post.
---
Did you actually read the post this time?
---
Yes, for anybody that has not figured it out there destroying infrastructure there, because well it's the group most able to contest them in the future, now it's unlikely as it would mean NC/PL to completely change but well no other group has the space to start.
---
Both
---
Well in that case supers existing is not the problem. It's the jump in effectiveness and cost.
---
I felt it my self when getting my hel, going from a carrier to a super was a one month journey an I had help from a friend to do it to
---
That's new player euphoria talking. Happens in all kinds of things, especially relationships. When it's new and exciting endorphines give you a euphoric rush and you think it's the best thing in the world. Then eventually it wears off and you can better judge how things really are. 
---
I have a friend, every new game he plays is the "best game in the world" then a few weeks or months later it's "I hate this game it sucks." 
---
Give it a few more months and then decide what you think of the game
---
It definitely threw me for a loop for the first month or so. I stopped caring and realized salty people are salty. I love the game. That's all the matters.
---
Oh shit i forgot i wasn't allowed to have those, fuck! I apologize profusely!
---
C'mon mate, 'Eve is dying' is just a meme. We all know its just AI vs AI nowadays while actual players ship-spin and shit talk in local.
---
Yea.. As you constantly combat the newbro that really needs to stay in the game.
---
Thanks very cherry picking.
---
Please read the whole post.
---
Just make caps and supers a lot less oppressive against subcaps. Slower ewar fighters, even less application for damage fighters, less tracking for titan guns etc.
---
If only it has a keepstar like DD with 10x the power which can wipe out 10 titans in one shot. Won't that be a sight for sore eyes?
---
yep there's still hope
---
I completely agree that what this subreddit needs are more awesome PVP videos and “this is Eve” stories.
---
I joined in 2007 and have been playing on and off since then, shit never changes.
---
Yes, but how do you reduce that massive jump in effectiveness and cost without causing just as much rage as removing the ships entirely would do?
---
rusting your jimmies is a guilty pleasure of mine.  i know it's childish, but damn is it funny to watch you mouth breathers get all worked up on an internet forum.
---
i shit post on /r/eve while i take shits.  i do it on my craptop.  now please respond with more salt, my last mine closed so i'm looking to start a new operation.
---
tl:dr  you're a bitch, come at me bro =D lol
---
Damn this is some good shit
---
Because your killboard stats are everything. Or because loss is part of the game. 
---
But you risk adverse pvp kiddos can't even engage an equal number force, let alone a superior one, before you warp away, cloak up and cry in local about something not going your way.

Good bait

Can confirm, evidenced by shit fit T1 meta Rorqs I've seen on zkill.
---
PL had vulnerabilities and could be beaten (as they obviously are being right now) whereas goons dominate in pretty much every aspect.
---
Read the while thing. Very well put. 
---
I was frustrated like OP a month ago, this helped finalize the last emotions.
---
What are you protesting tho?
---
this got posted so goon intelligence can farm our google account names /tinfoilhat_engage
---
&gt; rusting your jimmies
---
pointing out how pathetic you are isn't rustling my jimmies.
---
think of your argument as a swimming pool. the pool is filled with maybe 100 or 200 litres every week, but due to a big hole that was caused by the dumb producer, the pool looses 1000+ litres per week.
---
a few swimmers that really love the pool try to close that hole, but in the process of trying the spit maybe 10 litres out of the pool themselves.
---
and then you come around and tell them that they are the reason the pool gets empty.
---
sry for my bad english, but I expect you to get the point. if a few new players "collateral damage" are the price that has to be paid for ccp to wake up, well...... life contains a lot of disappointments
---
Eve is still good. Most players are still shitty, and they are being rewarded for being shitty. The few that try and voice against it (the players that the shitty players feed off of) are shut down by downvotes and more. Then these players leave. 
---
To say there's not problems with the state of the game, or that these problems (if not addressed in some fashion) will cull a massive amount of the games playerbase, resulting in eve less and less content. 
---
But why think, just downvote.
---
Uh... (1) should be upwards of 200m isk/hr/snake. That includes some overhead, but based on looking at some recent posts I'm not sure it includes enough overhead. I misread (2) as evictions at first. Escalations aren't a thing anymore, but the drifter battleship gives 300m in blue loot and can be cleared in 5 minutes with the right setup. The right setup being either a decently skilled dread or an Astrahus.
---
Good post, nice to see some data and now the usual "This is how it is since i say so"
---
Unfortunately lots of people are just fixated on rorq's now and facts dosent matter "They are bad, look if i have a million rorq's and mine for 23h a day with max implants under complete protection by a million supers, just like everyone,  rorq's are bad!"
---
You are such a fucking little bitch
---
I read 200LP and was sure you meant 200k LP. That would've been a pretty stellar reward. But 200LP, man, that's lame.
---
&gt; To say there's not problems with the state of the game
---
sure, but that doesn't mean eve is bad or dying.
---
literally everything in life has problems, and most of the are still fine and not dead - eve is no exception.
---
If someone has been playing that long, struggling to get ISK shouldn't be an issue. At some point though, even mountains of ISK can't motivate you to log in after you've done it all.
---
I personally use Pyfa (probably just like most people), but I think it would be cool for a website specifically made for discussion of fits that could be made on the site itself.
---
why cant my atron solo a rorqual?
---
Pressing F1 on undefended citadels is so much superior indeed.
---
GREAT Guide. Thank you!!
---
CCP's inattention and apparent unwillingness to fix multiple gameplay issues
---
I mean I guess its not a big leap to say that Goons aren't forcefully removing the North from their space because Panfam made the healthy choice to move. The difference is that Brave actually tried to put up a fight, knowing that all our shit was about to be burnt to the ground.
---
Are you planning to multibox?  
---
In any case if you are leaning towards performance try these settings: https://i.imgur.com/m8DXMgB.png
---
Resolution should be your displays natural resolution. If you run into performance troubles lower the shader setting. 
---
The shader setting is important for wormhole stuff as it allows you to determine where a wormhole leads via it's visual model. If you are not doing wormholes/ don't mind full potato go for low shader settings.

Pyfa is such a fleshed out tool I couldn’t see myself using anything else... having automatic character linking that keeps your skills updated would be nice, but pyfa manages this pretty well. It’s updated frequently and is supported well by the developer. I love to see an abundance of 3rd party tools to challenge developers to make theirs better, but I’m not sure if there’s much to do to improve on pyfa other then maybe “pretty ui”
---
Fuck new ships. Give me the balance pass/update of all balance passed/updates. Every existing ship has it's role redifened to the point where it is very difficult to find a reason not to fly any existing ship depending on your needs. Once they are all equally valid in a role, then we can think of new ships.

Wait, what? Since when are 'Hawks newbie friendly?
---
No U
---
But that’s the problem with this subreddit. We upvote “Eve is dying because of Falcon/Supers/Rorquals/Goons/Bob” as enthusiastically as we upvote posts about how great this game is. 
---
And the saddest part is that the negativity feeds further negativity, which drives down enthusiasm for the game and the amount of content in Eve.
---
Ask yourself, if 10,000 more people played this game, wouldn’t it be more fun? Even with its faults? Would Eve’s faults be as noticeable if the Eve universe was more full?
---
A lot of play styles have died over the years simply because there simply isn’t a critical mass of players to make them viable.
---
Idk when i was there nobody ever attacked the renters at all, I'd roll around in a Kronos looking to take on any small gangs and after 4 or 5 months i went back to prowling lowsec because literally NOBODY came to Tenal.
---
You're preaching to the choir about infrastructure though, getting a keep star down was like pulling teeth, getting a second one down was an actual miracle that had a name that mocked it put on it (Waste of Isk).
---
&gt; disrespectful to the Devs hard work.
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Ok, if you really a new bro. You need to sit down, shut up and stop talking about things that you don't understand.
---
The veteran players are tired of watching CCP destroy this game patch after patch. The game has only gotten worse (a lot worse) in the last 10 years. You as a new bro have not been here to see it. If you had then you would be saying the same things we are.
---
We all care deeply for the game, even if at time we disagree on what changes need to be made. The one thing we all agree on is that this can not continue the way it is now. 
---
As a new bro, you have next to no understanding of the core mechanics of the game and the deep problems rooted within. So sit back, try to learn some respect for people who, dead god, might know something that you don't you don't. Then maybe, just maybe you will start to learn something.

huehue flairbaited xd
---
Thats why the Triglavians stay in highsec. You cannot be dreadbombed if you never leave Highsec
---
Thats an interesting idea I hadn't considered.
---
yes please yes! I miss Osmium! It would be great to have a database of ship fittings that are actually useful without having to spend hours digging through Zkill finding a fit that is not dumb. Looking at the top kills on zkill will only get you so far. Would be cool to have a site that breaks down fits for roles like "best abyssal fit" "best ninja salvage fit" or "best gate camp fit" for each of the ships.
---
&gt; Panfam made the healthy choice to move
---
They didn't though, the house got repo'd and their all just hanging out on the sidewalk out front.
---
&gt;It will prevent alliances from stacking thousands of players in a single region which would result in a more populated nullsec regions in the game.
---
no it wouldn't - they'd just cycle through regions like a never ending plague of locusts. as one depletes they move to the next, and the next, and then back to the start and repeat the cycle.
---
&gt;It will decrease the amount of bots since the huge alliances would need the space for their own members instead of renting it out.
---
your idea does fuck all to address botting. most of the people who rent regions out, do so because they don't want to put the effort in to extracting resources to begin with.
---
&gt;It will decrease the efficiency of the super capital umbrella to some degree which would make the nullsec a more dangerous place and it will also bring more content for smaller pvp groups.
---
no it won't, see point 1 that people will still huddle up under one single umbrella.
---
&gt;Thousands of highsec pubbies who moved under supercap umbrella will start feeding and crying (not quite sure if that is a bad thing)
---
no they won't, they won't give a fuck about changes in areas of space they don't live in.
---
&gt;And that is mostly because players can rat/mine in a single system endlessly because there is no diminish return.
---
and said empty space means they can just cycle through systems because there aren't enough players to keep them depleted.
---
1290 Goon Titans can still probably oneshot it back with DDs
---
Great post.
---
Happy Cake Day!

It has DPS cap of...3000?
---
just adapt
---
its more in line as the new activity doesn't make as much as what they are doing now. But like you said at a certain point you have enough isk to last some time. That being said you should try and change up the gamemode for a bit and use the saved up isk as a pillow.
---
So you didn't kill it?
---
Also, the "warp away" was pretty awesome
---
Do you happen to have a link to that video?
---
inb4 someone things they are developing the mobile game
---
About Fade? Last time I checked, vily wasn't in Brave. When Cagali says that's not what happened then I'll start questioning it.
---
So it's a player made reason, not a CCP made reason it sounds like. So why would CCP need to make a reason to invade, if the players are doing it themselves already?
---
Agreed. I am a terrible human 99.9% of the time here, but much like rookie chat; Don't hurt the new-bros in training. 
---
We need them later...
---
So:
---
\- I tried to get every killmail with a titan on it since 01-01-2018. 
---
\- I then got the titan pilots (some killmails had people without a valid ship type, mostly carriers with fighters, there were ignored, I don't think they were statistically significant) on these killmails.
---
\- Assigned them to coalitions with two ways: based on their current alliance / corporation and based on their alliance / corporation at the time of the kill. With the second way, it's a bit complicated to account for pilots that switched sides, but hopefully they shouldn't be a significant number.

Again, not sure the numbers and methodology is 100% correct, but I think they're not orders of magnitude different from the real numbers.

take shots every time a reddit post about eve dying pops up
---
I have been talking about fade this whole time. I only know what I read about when it comes to tapi. But I know what happened in Fade.
---
I would rather then be changed the removed, removing them is a wast of time an money for players an dev's
---
Keeping them an changing the means you still have the supers and your investment it's just not as good as it used yo be.
---
Let the people that drop supers go as they clearly didn't get them because the liked them just because there op.
---
You can’t not make me not can’t downvote not you.

it is the cringiest iteration of "calling it" but you did a good job there

pretty much sums it up, not much else to say
---
Normally development takes time, and most of what they are supposedly working on was on hold due to the 64 bit client. They need this working and stable before they can push other items out the door.
---
No, the difference is when test, brave, or goons do it, it's okay. When PL does it they're bad people who are killing the game.
---
Interesting. I always considered what goes on here good or bad to be [player generated content.](https://i.redd.it/u3z4pskvnxez.jpg)

After all. If you are not careful, which so many are not; then you can quickly find your actions have severe ramifications in the game both good and bad.

&gt;I would rather then be changed the removed, removing them is a wast of time an money for players an dev's
---
Obviously there would need to be some serious compensation to super pilots in the event this happened.  My vote would be to let them choose between receiving the isk value of their removed supers, receiving 10% over the isk value of their supers in regular carriers/dreads, or getting to keep the super but it can no longer fit any modules and is basically just a space ornament (ala the veldnaught).
---
Also, removing them would take less dev time than rebalancing them yet again.
---
If eve was about the PVE, what does eve have to offer that makes it better or unique compared to any run-of-the-mill MMO?
---
The part about eve that makes it interesting is the PVP. Eve PVE has never (and will never) make headlines. Eve PVP does.
---
If given the chance, players will optimaoze the fun out of everything.
---
Limited in what why? Making ore anom respawns much longer, such as in line with asteroid replenishment (that's roughly once every 2-3 days) would make big groups spread out, but small ones wouldn't see much of a change. 
---
But permanent lost off resources in an area? I don't feel like that would do anyone any favors right now.
---
This from the guy who doesn't want to fight at all?

No please I  don't want to see milf ad
---
For their sake I hope they have industrial strength livers
---
What?
---
Wow, *someone* from PL is salty that TEST/BRAVE learned that Industry Is Strength**™** and decided to start fighting back against the 'elite supercapital PVP veterans' by producing a comparable defensive capability. Apparently everything would be A-OK in EVE if the newbie/mass groups had just rolled over and let PL continue to farm them for lulz?  
---
The 'dinoposting' critique might be more legitimate if it weren't true that the super-elite-PL-and-friends-gang literally followed BRAVE and TEST around the map of New Eden for *YEARS* harassing them for little more than easy kills to green their e-peens.
---
Or it seems like you really just have nothing of value to add, either way it boggles the mind why you responded in the first place.
---
I quit the game because I lost interest. I predicted this would happen in past threads one was down voted to hell and back. As I have said Goons Test and Gotg have amassed huge resources within the mechanics of the game the problem is by doing so they have killed the game. CCP screwed the pooch when they made the rorqual changes years ago. They fixed the dam when all the water was already gone and now we are left with 5000 titans. Its a bit like a billionnaire turning round to a homeless person and saying what do you mean you can't afford a ferrari?
---
The legacy of Vile Rat has been to create diplomatic ties that mean that no group in null sec will ever be dislodged ever again which is in all seriousness one hell of a legacy to have. The problem is that after WWB, there were efforts made to make sure that anyone who could potentially start a rebellion was recruited or so starved on content they left the game. I played the game for 9 years and lost interest because I couldn't go out without getting dropped by titans in a cruiser gang, and to say well "git good" has meant that low sec from being alively echo system has now become a ghost town. Null sec is a blue donnut and high sec is being "rented" out by people with alts in null sec or null sec entities. 
---
This probably comes across as bitter and maybe it is a little but it comes from a place of sadness in that eve was a massive part of my life for so long and now I feel nothing. I hope it recovers and that one day I can return to former glories but for now I am done with it.
---
Well, I mean, fun, fun is a thing.

nullsec bucketcentipede: who eats the shittiest shit

It's just a spreadsheet that numerous people submit data to so we can laugh at ourselves. It's not some monumental undertaking.

According to the dev blog in they released in March:
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;In July we are planning to introduce some long-anticipated implant sets. We also will be picking up where we left off with module tiericide efforts, which have been on the backburner for a while now.
---
We’re about half-way through June, so might here something about it in the next couple weeks.
---
Of course there could be more that they just haven’t mentioned yet either.
---
I think you need to speak to the highsec role players association
---
So you didn't try wormholes?
---
Well, what can they do?
---
Yeah.....*sigh*
---
There isn't one. I think i remember them saying it was something for small groups to do to put their name on a system cheaply. The IHUB is the real sov structure.
---
Yes, but as comments noted, focus on feedback and storing fits, not on an analysis tool since those are covered ok already. A database of qualify fits to replace the dead ones would be nice.
---
new skins
---
I fractured the back of my skull from facepalming. Thanks. Now I have type 2 diabetes.
---
I'll think of my argument exactly as it is posed.
---
 Ignore CCP, there are many factors. I'm focused on one single factor. The general, consistent theme in the community, that is spread by the community, that the game is not worth investing in for new players.
---
If you focus on this in particular - my argument is clear. There are things removing players from the game. I don't care about any of those EXCEPT WHAT THE PLAYERS THEMSELVES ARE DOING. I'll repeat this again, and again, and again, and people will still bring up CCP like she's Hillary Clinton at a trump rally, but at the end of the day I'm not talking about CCP. I'm only talking about what the players are doing to the game. 
---
You can argue CCP is causing the loss of more players than the playerbases actions, but you need to do so else where. This post is about the effects of the player base, not CCP.
---

Just move the world Ark to Jita and have it blow up 4-4 and all the merch/ships inside.  Hit the reset button on the market.

You are looking at it wrong, the question you should be asking is "what rules would cause basic human behavior to avoid X / embrace Y"
---
Then why do you have 75 upvotes if only 60 people on this subreddit?
---
Why can't I hold a region or two with a friend with our two Ibises?
---
My bad,i forgot that majority of this sub is the spodbrains from GSF. How did i dare to mention the change that would hurt their crabbing.
---
turn flux off before taking a screenshot mate
---
hurt? they'd literally be the only ones able to.
---
No im absolutely sure that TEST would have decided to move and BRAVE went Nah fuck it we're sticking it out bud.
---
Sounds legit.
---
I mean really limited. Zero cargo and non-recharging cap.
---
When we got that kill it was definitely one of those wait no way dude link the KM.
---
You must have forgotten that this game loves ridiculously long cooldowns.
---
Also, I have much more to expand on that idea, such as a mechanic that requires a Titan(s) on grid. However, I won't bother because 1) I'm not space famous, and 2) a majority of this sub always bitches about supercap proliferation but a lot of those same pubbies will get absolutely fucking tilted once anybody even suggests something that even *slightly* curbs it.
---
Currently the only thing that exists in this game that can combat a Titan blob, is a bigger Titan blob and several hours of time. Nothing exists in this game at the moment that can literally fucking ***DELETE*** numerous Titans in an instant (if we're not including CCP god powers). If the trigs could have that ability and use it once in a blue moon, I think it would even give Goon FCs a run for their money, because they now have to learn how to properly space out and position supercap fleets and not just blob them in one warp-in. Plus, imagine the third-partying opportunities for hostile alliances if the right intel is gathered.
---
implying the p2w switch wasn't a last ditch effort in inflating player numbers, and the lack of botting bans a stop-gap to increasing player numbers short term
---
And bam, Mr. I didn't read the post number 637,welcome, please have a seat. While your waiting, please read the post in its entirety before spending more time replying than you did reading the post.
---
Yeah.
---
Plenty of awesome adventures to be had and stories to tell if people look for them.
---
You forgot to add the POSes
---
You're right,it wont change anything. Lets better keep the game as it is and continue crabbing as a 35k man alliance in a single region with infinite resources and keep crying on reddit how no one will fight us and the game is dead.
---
or they could like, shocker, nerf the ship if its deemed too powerful
---
I'd love to say you're right, but you're not. CCP rarely listens unless there's been much enough bitching already - and even then it most often gives no change.
---
I was a new player once as well, and honestly, players aren't driving people away. In fact, instead of being driven away I got sunked in, cause I met some really cool folks (now I'm inactive but that's besides the point, I still am in my corp's discord for social stuff and for when I decide to resubscribe).
---
The thing is like others said - the bitching is there for a reason. I've seen a lot of changes that CCP implemented, and ignored the feedback fully or partially at least. Not to mention that numerous times I personally felt like CCP just don't play their own game, like ever. People get fed up with that, and so bitching starts because normal feedback has been ignored.
---
i hear you brother
---
Except wormholes address the problem...
---
Who cares what they are doing in k space?
---
I agree, this subreddit is the endgame for old bittervets
---
Or you could just run another vni..
---
prob. a old CRT in a smoked room.
---
Bots clearly
---
hu no? That's with ONE account.
---
Read the whole post twice and down voted.
---
Yeah. I left 4 years ago, and at that time people were talking about how supers and too overpowered and wrecking ball fleets were ruining the game.
---
Come back and it's still supers are too overpowered and titan fleets are ruining the game.
---
But the game is still pretty interesting.
---
A lot. They can fix the major issues, but they dont appear to care, so the game will die.
---
I was one of these people, as much as a part of me smiles seing NC/PL getting getting their shit kicked in. it doesn't justifiy the absolute state of the game that has allowed the current state of affairs to come about.
---
Also dino/boonie posting (probably from spodbrains that wern't even there) regarding the above is insufferable.
---
That's what a blueprint looks like in production. They're broadcasting them. When the first shit fit one dies belt ratting, wake me up and send the zkill link.
---
That is first I have told you to seek help. Others told you the same.
---
So basically the same thing.
---
Back then it was 40 afk Mackinaw's, and now it's less afk rorqs.
---
People were buying pilots back then too.
---

---
&gt; so you're probably just bad at the game
---
makes it too obvious
---
You know what they mean with module tiericide?
---
The venue for all their events is being remodeled...
---
And...many alliances have whole fleets of Titans and have for quite a while.
---
In my 6 years in the corp? Yes.
---
Which play styles are dead that we cannot do anymore?
---
I honestly have no idea who you are
---
You are telling people how to act. You are attempting to enforce your rules for behavior upon others.
---
Sure, but the issue still remains: we don't really know.
---
A lot?
---
Care to be more specific?
---
As I new player myself. From what I can tell it's the direction that eve has taken that the Eve veterans are upset about. What they like about eve is what is being stripped away and instead going in a different direction than they want.
---
But they've invested years into this game, they won't stop. So they vent.
---
All you have to do is find a corp that is based around supporting new players if you want to get away from the venting that exists in certain pools.
---
It isn't about the end game or the elite play it's about the direction of the game for them. It's a bitterness that is only likely to grow because their direction isn't likely to change.
---
As much as their direction upsets one group of people it attracts another.
---
YOU are trying to make it that way in this very thread lol.
---
everyone be taking freighters then lol
---
brave live in catch thou
---
Negativity is allowed in normal human discourse.
---
&gt;Eve is still good. 
---
eve is the best game in it's class, but that doesn't mean that for many people, the game has become not worth playing.
---
the game has gotten objectively worse, look at the massive exodus of players as evidence.
---
A thread so good a random nerd is spamming it in Jita
---
Zoomers like you think if you keep saying something it will come true... sad
---
Yes, back then it was 40 Mack’s. Now it’s 40 rorqs. Do you see that scaling is making a bad problem that much worse?
---
Idk. I guess I illed rather they nerf then remove as it would be a shame to see such a cool class be removed.
---
Like pocos?
---
Nope he is listed
---
Please mark the correct answer (multiple correct answers):
---
a) lul no
---
b) not in a million years
---
c) now send some iskies
---
I actually have an issue with this guy, as I can't read him. Either he is dead serious, or one of most persistent shit posters here.
---
The game was really good before loot spew and we still had the jukebox. In fact, removing the jukebox was the beginning of the end. 99% of CCP decisions since then have been GARBAGE.
---
No, I am not putting it on to a race. I'm saying NO ONE has a right to put a falsehood upon an entire race. His race doesn't matter in the slightest to me.
---
How?
---
How is it worse?
---
Rendering losses meaningless isn't really a huge issue--it might actually drive content.  The issue is that producing/procuring supercaps has become trivial for a handful of groups and night-impossible (on any meaningful scale) for everyone else.
---
That's an interesting idea.
---
apply to ISRAD
---
a few fcs are the drivers of the vast majority content your 40k blob has, and that's true for most nullblocs. They may not be the majority but they're the ones who -mostly- know what they're talking about.
---
Have an Astrahus fit or video for dealing with the drifter battleship?
---
Point on the bot, warp to me
---
Basic human behavior hasn't changed in the last 16 years, but the political landscape of nullsec has changed a lot in that time. You can look back on times when nullsec was more active and ask yourself what's different now in terms of gameplay. A few things pop out straight away:
---
* Supercap umbrellas have never been more powerful. They stifle just about all roaming content.
---
* Structure bashing has never been more tedious and obnoxious as it is now. It makes war for territory really unappealing.
---
* Supers have never been better at stifling fights than they are now. Thanks to injectors you can have as many as you can grind. Their special treatment in terms of immunity to counters like booshing or ewar is outdated. Their special treatment in being able to shit on literally every other ship class unassisted is outdated. They need a complete rework. 
---
* Access to limitless resources has never been easier. Anoms just keep spawning no matter how many people you cram into the same space. Moons provide enough high grade mining for as many rorq alts as you can inject. 
---
* Individual player skill in PVP has never been less important than now. Traditionally groups like m0o or BoB or Skill urself could hold their own against larger entities because they were flat out better on an individual basis. Now all that matters is how many supers you can field, and even the worst PVPer in the game can fly a super effectively. Skill is *the only* advantage a smaller group can have over a larger one and it means nothing today.
---
tl;dr: Supers are fucking garbage and the game wouldn't be half as fucked now if they weren't so unbalanced. Plenty of FCs and PVP players warned about this 3 years ago, now here we are.
---
Injectors, bots, isk fountain, cynos, rorqs.
---
clearly it's not that much of a problem since they're still playing and leading fleets.
---
hell i've seen more people wanting to do that recently than ever before, the number of new FCs i've flown under recently is pretty high.
---
In the very soul :(
---
Test used to be about fun, content, yolo fights.   Now it's just a circlejerk of blue doughnutting, but I'm probably just the Eve equivalent of a bitter old man
---
Could you imagine if a carrier could actually hold subcaps with pilots in them - if you think projection is a problem *now*...
---
How about the fact that it's literally moronic to try to diagnose people due to a couple comments on a sub reddit ABOUT VIDEO GAMES. did I threaten anyone? Did I do anything to promote paranoia?
---
Lmao its the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Tell me one reason I should "seek help". Your an ass, man. There are people in the world with real issues and your using this as a crutch to win an argument. Your a walking asshole for trying to use something like that as a weapon.
---
I agree that they're cool, but leaving them in as ornaments (transferrable ones preferably) would still allow for the cool factor without killing every other form of play.
---
without this one aspect, there wouldnt be a game for you to try right now.  the people that take part in that one aspect have driven ccps recruitment of new players and revenue for year, and now they've fucked it up so bad its pretty much beyond repair.
---
So when you say its only one aspect, its like saying your heart has stopped but the rest of your organs are fine so everything should be ok right?
---
[Yup, rare alright](https://i.gyazo.com/90923fc0ef0bc5cbc7bf47ddd5b0cafe.png)
---
Once you can afford the gold, save it for a post bitching about issues with EVE. Spin level: master.
---
No, not simple. I do not equate WinterCo with any particular race. I see singled them out because CCP has singled them out more than the other party mentioned (Test). I base my views upon facts, seems the lot of you base your facts upon your views.
---
Not probably.  
---
Test is fun times brotato.
---
Catch is for PVP :)
---
Lol, yes because big blob warfare is totally different right ?
---
This has no relevancy with Test unless goons are involved. Picture is inaccurate.
---
I think there's a lot of pretentious pseudointellectuals that like to try to toot their own horn. Does that count?
---
There's that rule word again. Which rules exactly stainguysbasterdson?
---
What rules are those?
---
Waiting....
---
Back in the day there was 5+ tiers of modules. T1, Meta 2-5, T2, Faction, Officer. The Meta 2-5 had better fittings, with meta 5 being the best before t2 was introduced; beside faction/officer.
---
Meta modules have been completely reworked for most high slots since they started the "tier-icide" process.
---
Test was living in catch when brave was living in Fade so I'm not sure what the fuck you're talking about.

Not sure who you think you replied to, but I haven't played since 2014, and haven't ever played with either of those alliances either. In fact I spent a fair amount of time fighting against them. I went Atlas-&gt;Init-&gt;Rage-&gt;Nulli Secunda-&gt;Retirement Club-&gt;Casually flying with RL friends in a few random lowsec groups and briefly with Test-&gt;Quit. It's just objectively bad for the balance of power to have any one group of people overpowering the combined weight of literally everyone else by more than a 2:1 ratio.

---
just get ride off old anoms
---
instead make players travel to find isk,not sitting all day long in 1 system farming rats after rats.the more u ratting the less u get
---
n00b don't you know you're just supposed to dock up and then talk shit on reddit about how *EVE is dead*
---
No shit?
---
#nopoors
---
You... didn't read his post when he read yours; Who da tool now?
---
But seriously, Concurrent players down, 
---
new whales investing hard into the game down (but new alpha ratters in like crazy to the point CCP cracking down) forcing plex prices up with little change in plex sales numbers per market (less in, same bought on market/used = prices rising),
---
Alliances withdrawing to low sec storage or disbanding quitting.
---
I like the game, even if it goes Serenity route; There shall be still be ratter hunting That said, there is a schism going on, though not death/dying of Eve. 
---
Players are protesting the transition to Serenity
---
I’ve lately been working on updating 3D character shaders for DX12.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pnn778/eve-64-bit-and-directx-12
---
There are thousands of solo and independent EVE players that completely disagree with you.
---
Oh well at that point you might as well be running more havens. Same isk but far less effort.
---
you can search the comments of all your big fcs in this subreddit alone and youll find them complaining, asher, kendarr being two you're 100% sure to encounter. Going to test just look at pgl and vily, i don't think there is a single relevant ls fc that didn't complain non stop.
---
"new" fcs are irrelevant to this, structure bash/harpy fc number 35 doesn't deal with a lot, there's a reason I said a few and not all.
---
I think the only two relevant ones i havent seen complain is dbrb and seddow(?)
---
deez nuts
---
Who?
---
What am I trying to do exactly? Please spell it out so I can strip each invalid example down one by one.
---
In trying to prevent new players from seeing post and post after post about how this game is dead and then just giving up on it.
---
What is it about care bears again? Give me some more kindergarten references please, their illuminating your state of mind.
---
At which point bots will just warp to POSes or safe spots.
---
Your the biggest issue with eve.
---
Never saw a Titan in battle yet. Playing eve since 2014 and joined nullsec legacy last year in October.
---
You make seem as if NC/PL are the only people that have dropped 10x the amount of shit on anyone.. I've seen goons do it, snuff, INIT. ,etc.. It's apart of the game, doesn't mean it sucks any less, but stop crying about shit like NC/PL are the only ones...
---
Hot take: add it for Titan/super losses.
---
and yet, none of them are doing anything about it and are all still active and playing. so as i said, the status quo can't be that bad.
---
Not really, as far as I know, every single major entity has received public punishment from CCP for having a botting issue. Goons, GotG, PanFam, HRE, WinterCo, Legacy, so on.
---
And I don't play anymore, I just curate the history of the game for my own personal reading pleasure, so everything I look at it is based upon fact, because a true story is far more interesting to read than a lie, and fudging the facts is not just an injustice to history, but serves no point when it's not used in a public capacity as a propaganda effort.
---
Those cancerous full screen ads on mobile zkill tho 🤮
---
why not?
---
Good lord nothing either of you replied with had anything to do with the post at the top of the page. You both realize this, right? Your so passionate about hating eve you can't show down for a moment and see what's in front of your eyes. REAAADD
---
Yes but what change are you wanting specificity?
---
The Eve player base is one of the reasons the game is a bit screwy, sure - but the problem is the Eve playerbase represents probably at least 50-60% of people who would actually like Eve and give a game enough time to play to this level.
---
Eve itself isn't a casual game, and the gamers it's attracted have become casual in their nature (i.e "I log in to set PI, see if any fleets are there and log out,  but am here if Sov is attacked" - so now you have a ghost town game that can't naturally evolve because people will only login for events.
---
Site doesn't work :(
---
Mega class Star Dreadnought confirmed.... so when do we get to have it?
---
Eh I guess. Probly best to remove for now at least. To maybe bring back later when they have a fix. If they ever do.
---
Your talking about actual loss vs paper loss, there is a no comparison.  We can return to Delve after this war , and ramp up to pre war income in a day, whereas PanFam will need at least 6 months to get back to pre war status.
---
Oh yes, its not like there's several other people who I've seen on reddit to whom this has happened.
---
Protests tend to work best when there are simple, concrete, and measurable demands.  Going all, "I'm angry and hate this shit!" gets you nothing because you haven't asked for anything.  So what are the specific demands?  What concrete action could CCP take that would make this a success?
---
Also this sort of thing needs wide community support and, lacking a flash point to get everybody riled up as we had back with Incarna, a couple of weeks at least for the word to get around and for people to understand what is going on.  Calling for this on Reddit five days before go time and expecting results pretty much guarantees nobody will notice any difference in logins.
---
what in the flying fuck are they going to do about it? you have the csm already spelling out shit's retarded in person with the devs, what is cheetodemon 15 gonna do? 
---
do you have some direct line of communication with ccp we're not privy to?
---
I mean, they released stats, TEST and Goons barely made a blip.
---
At the second site that spawned in system the drop was the Zorya's heavy Entropic disintegrator, if the guy show ninja looted the wreck of the BC, was telling the truth of the loot. 
---
Looks looks really cool when fleet spawns and the ark redraw to from where it came. CCP did a really cool job on the effects in the site visually.
---
ask the OP, they're the one telling people to go and do something about it - which as i have pointed out, just because a few people on reddit whine a lot doesn't mean 'everyone' is upset with the status quo.
---
I'm sure it is for you, flair checks out.
---
For people like me who played for constant action though, it's a big step backwards from where it used to be.
---
Yeah but then they just reappear in Period Basis, Paragon Soul, Omist, Fade, Deklein, Fountain, or pick a drone region.
---
Someone actually outdid Monkey Attack Squad? Thats impressive. That group is full of fucking idiots.
---
Care Bears are a happy group of cuddly bears that want love and niceness all around.
---
You are here telling us we should be nicer and to lie and say everything is great, when it isn't.
---
You are acting like a Care Bear from TV.
---
You want us to stop making negative comments. That is you attempting to enforce an arbitrary "no negative comments" rule upon this subreddit.
---
This. I've seen a lot more toxicity on this sub and ingame than I ever did back when I got regular fights.
---
All I see now are people being left behind by reality.
---
I see people blob a solo assault frigate and spam racist shit in local, instead of even thinking maybe a good fight would be fun.
---
This subreddit shows just how bad it's gotten.
---
I really hope the 3d character shaders get used more *wink*
---
Sounds like exactly the same stuff that was going on in 2014
---
So when eve algo posts active players online? They count only,... an IP address, or the 5 bot accounts flying multi-box ishtars? Or, are you seriously kidding me?, each ratting gang is separate accounts fleet warped all flying the exact same ship! Come on, K0NY bots?
---
More of them? Less of them? What?
---
Dude, come on.
---
You're not even trying to make a coherent argument.
---
40 Mack’s means there is to many carriers/dreads around....bad
---
40 rorqs means there are to many supers/titans.....worse
---
You should seek help because you seriously lack the emotional coping skills that others have, or else this post would never have been made.
---
Better idea... Limit resources in every security space including high sec (and those wormholes or something). Then make high sec resources have longer re-spawn timers (2x as long or something).  
---
Pros:  
---
* Higher risk = higher reward (so go join a null sec block and get out of high sec)
---
* More people move to Null sec.
---
* The Mittani -PBUH- would invent a mobile super umbrella so the Imperium becomes a slow rolling locus fleet.
---
* High sec pubbie tears because they have no sites to run.
---
Cons:  
---
* Thousands of highsec pubbies who moved under the leadership of The Mattani -PBUH- and the Imperium will be just as safe as they are in Delve during peacetime.  
---
But let's call a spade a spade shall we? OP is just another gerr goons hat goons pubbie.  
---
So please, send me you down votes and beautiful tears. My cup overfloweth with salt. :p
---
Link? That's something I'm actually genuinely interested in seeing, since the last stats I saw were released months ago
---
This. Null as it is today will die or eve will die. I figure we've got a year?
---
Lol 😀 I'm glad everyone likes it
---
I've loved the new 64-bit client so far, and I'm looking forward to the updated graphics support. How's the Mac support for the DX12 transition coming?
---
It's all people fly
---
Lmao in telling you complain about the issues and NOT THE ENTIRE GAME. Take a bite of and chew on that for a while, it may take you a minute.
---
I honestly don't even know what I did wrong. The only thing it could've been is me trying to log into the auth when I came back to Eve, but hadn't joined back just yet. Access to the forums and stuff was obviously locked so I didn't think it was a big deal... But I guess it was.
---
fock sov,drop it all and be npc
---
this subreddit pretty much consists of:
---
60% shit posts 
---
20% salt/tears
---
10% propaganda
---
10% actual content
---
and i’m probably down playing the % of shitposts and salt lol.
---
ignore the subreddit, enjoy the game.
---
In some ways, having an emptier universe is a good thing for many styles.  Explorers, wormholers, solo players, lowsec mission runners, anyone doing PVE content or non-player-based money-making benefits from having less competition and less populated space.
---
Looks pretty much like the same issue to me.
---
I scrolled through looking for the "bout tree fiddy" but no one posted it....
---
So....bout tree fiddy
---
Are you...
---
Ok I'm not gonna insult you other than ask, please bro, stop fucking replying and read the post.
---
At what point, did ANYONE, say no negative comments?
---
And their population is literally dwarfed by the players engaged in that "one aspect" thats broken, and without those players there woudln't be a game for you to play because it would have shut down ages ago.
---
WE provide the press for this game that attracts new players through that broken aspect.  WE make the news headlines, not those few thousand who disagree, so honestly, fuck you and them.
---
Why would you want to incentivise defending your structures?
---
Didn't mean to come off as such. Was just very drunk. Mostly I was just saying that, if you know em, name em, since it is a thread about what groups are doing small scale/nomadic stuff well right now
---
And acknowledging that Volta is a different breed from what a WH alliance traditionally is
---
And that my reasons for mentioning them might have been a bit different than what was originally assumed :p
---
PL never tried to evict you from Catch you poor little fragile thing.  When we were farming you in TFI's, you were literally that, a crop to be harvested.  You can ask one of the dozens of broken alliances what it looked like when we came to kick somebody out of their space.
---
Thanks for clearing up exactly how fragile you are though, it grounds your stupidity for me.  "Oh guys they shot us they're trying to kick us out".
---
You wouldn't say that in AUTZ!
---
I've really enjoyed the 64-bit client! Is there any plans for updating the graphics on the skybox though? It would make such a difference (and I think is a fairly small project)!
---
Ever heard of Alts
---
basically incursion comms
---
here's what adding costs to things does.
---
to the big guy; fuck all, it's a rounding error.
---
to the small guy; a sizeable chunk of their proportionally smaller war chest.
---
It's a hot streaming pile of hatred in here man
---
What a let down...
---
They don't care. Lowsec is ded.
---
&gt;They can fix the major issues,
---
&gt;Injectors, bots, isk fountain, cynos, rorqs.
---
What dont you understand?
---
Then you get the guy who got caught in his covetor so he warped in his avatar to save it, then warped in his fax to save the avatar, and lost them all.
---
Lmao, your a total ass. Your no longer receiving responses from me. My "emotional coping skills" dude, don't feed me the same bullshit you get fed by your parents and school therapist mate.
---
That's a local issue dude. Try incognito mode to see if it's fixed then try clearing cache and cookies.
---
How to fix them?
---
Like, literally the question I asked you.
---
What can they do? Be specific. What do you think needs to be done to fix the problems?
---
There is a cost-benefit issue, like the end result is gonna be GSF will declare victory after popping an unknown number of structures and go home, like this isn't an invasion because we want your stuff this is we want to die you the ability to build up stuff. 
---
After that the north will likely go back to the status quo it was before GSF invaded, maybe with a GOTG deletion as the rest of the north will likely hate them now, but even then they have nobody to install there because of lack of players. 
---
Like this isn't an invasion this is a destroy some stuff go home event because space itself isn't valuable.
---
Yes, we evac to sarenen which was our low-sec stager where we were send fleets out 24/7 (literally every morning I would wake up to about 10-20 pings on my phone).
---
Fuck me the comms are painfully embarrassing.
---
This is racist.
---
Oh God, this. I get private convo'd by a newbie in npc corp chat, so they could insult me, for trying to explain why I wasn't going 10 jumps into low so I could shoot rats off them covetor just because we were the same "faction".
---
Sure, which resulted in the fatigue changes in Phoebe. 
---
Difference is now we've got injectors and Keepstar docking, making the imbalances in supercaps worse than ever.
---
They are almost done. They said that all versions of the new Apple Monitor Stands will be supported.
---
It doesn't matter some desperate weirdo is keeping CCP afloat buying injectors and Plex. Once that stops all the Plex will dry up.
---
Another mistake was backstabbing CO2 for russians by legacy... During impass days i was in CO2, and CO2 was the alliance losing less rorquals than anyone at that time..  We would built another major super fleet against imperium..
---
Though i had been in CFC in WWB and my corp left the coalition and i was dreaming getting back. And i have been in GSF for one year and happy..
---
But i loved being in CO2. Undocking every single time hostiles show up, wiping fleets.. Eve is good when you dont take so serious..
---
Why would you not want to? That would mean a large alliance would have to commit a number of people to defence rather than making generating isk.
---
Why black out the names? \^.-
---
There isn’t one single problem that everyone can agree on to fix Eve. So trying to get everyone to work together, when we don’t all have a common goal, is pointless. 
---
CCP can see the numbers. They know that they need Eve to keep working. They’ll do their best to fix it, and maybe they’ll fail, but this protest won’t help either way
---
Elite at what? Moral posting while getting butt raped all over the north? Yeah if you need to do that to press log in I guess their elite in morale gathering 🙄
---
Delve had 50% as much mining activity in May as it had in April, and about 60% as much NPC bounty.
---
Seems like the losses might have been a little more than this spreadsheet reflects, or maybe the Delve minute amount needs to be updated!
---
Wow your really gonna take credit for the trend of not hundreds of thousands of dollars eve spends on marketing?
---
You really just did that?
---
Angry gamer is not in touch with reality gamer.
---
You missed a few tristans and interceptors.
---
Flair baited
---
My phone goes off all day long with content fleets, Stratops.  Even if you’re logged in during a lull in the action and just hanging in eso there’s constant Volta/ferra/bombers bar roams in.  
---
My evaluation of you is you’re a whiner who would sit around and bitch that there’s nothing to do because you couldn’t be bothered doing whatever was being organized... nor could you be bothered to organize your own fleets.  
---
You can always go gate camp frat space and skirmish that foe.  Wander into stain and harass them.  Even go and harass imperium because contrary to what all these morons (you included) here say Test and imperium are definitely content for each other.    
---
So I’m literally not having your shit.
---
Because- - -?
---
I would love to sell that permit...
---
&gt; The general, consistent theme in the community, that is spread by the community, that the game is not worth investing in for new players.
---
Bull. Fucking. Shit.

Every damn one of those posts receives a positive response, so where's all this toxicity you want to lecture us about?
---
That's not the way this works. You can't expect people who disagree with your premise to just not argue against it, and in favor of their premise (that CCP actions have a greater effect on player count than r/eve bitching)
---
because people have this weird idea that their idea is something special and deserves it's own thread instead of posting their shitty ideas in one thread.
---
almost every retarded idea thread is a shitty version of another thread they read, so instead of replying to the thread they make a new thread.
---
I have a colombian friend whant want to make a drug cartel in EVE, is this possible? Are they illegal substances that we can make and sell.
---
This is an adorable troll post. And I'm down voting it
---
Small groups would see a huge change. They wouldn't have space anymore as the large groups gobble it all up.
---
whooosh
---
Yup, its mostly you. The sandbox you want is not a game with any foundations or structure.
---
This guy fucks.
---
If the cost to do damage is less than the cost to repair. Decentralized small guys can individually make small gains while all together making larger gains.
---
I haven't told anyone to do anything. I am merely asking the question of why players who are upset at the situation are not taking action? What *is* stopping them and what is keeping these coalitions as they are?
---
And, as I put in my title, "everyone" is in quotes. I know that every, single person of the player-base isn't upset at the game's current climate. If it was truly everyone, no one would play. "Everyone" is addressing the figurative group that salty players refer to when they complain about the game on this subreddit.
---
Dude go look at the front page of this subreddit RIGHT NOW. how many posts of dead game did you have to scroll past.
---
Front page. Right now.
---
Unbelievable.
---
Do you have a permit to post on reddit? I can't find any record of you in our database. If not, please send me 10m ISK so I can issue you your permit and update the database accordingly.
---
Praise James.
---
Bittervets who already won eve.
---
Didn't know pods could fit a cyno or guns.
---
Because the number of players that are actually unhappy with the game is minuscule.  Reddit is just a squeaky wheel that u can ignore
---
Why are you lying? You said:
---
&gt;Well, what can they do?
---
So I told you.
---
&gt;What do you think needs to be done to fix the problems?
---
Capital skills no longer injectable, bots auto detected and auto banned, cynos have activation delay, limitations on ratting and mining in null. Then they can look into sov and fw.
---
&gt; I am merely asking the question of why players who are upset at the situation are not taking action?
---
they are, they're whining - that is their action.
---
&gt;What is stopping them and what is keeping these coalitions as they are?

---
Bait. Average at best. Still upvoting because it's accurate.
---
Well we lost everything but we are currently regrouping and rearming in high sec and we learned from our mistakes and we about to go again in 0.0 for another try to take and hold sov
---
[Citation needed]
---
no, big guys will just absolutely abuse it to bankrupt the smaller guys.
---
if i know that the small guy's wallet is going to take a disproportionately large hit every time i hit their structure - i'm going to reinforce it every time i can until they're out of isk or have no structures left because they can't afford to repair them.
---
meanwhile, who cares if they hit mine? the repair cost is trivial and i don't even notice because i'm a big guy.
---
Marketing the fights we start?  Yea, we'll take credit for that.  It was us that got them in the NYtimes, us that got them in forbes, us that got them into the washignton post, not their advertising which has over the years gotten them a fractional return on investment compared to what the players do for the game.
---
As for somebody who's not in touch, its you, as you can see by this thread and all the people telling you all the reasons you should eat a bucket of dicks with your dumb shit.
---
Best reply I've seen all day. Good points. The point is to make sure CCP and Pearl Abyss know that action is needed on MANY fronts, narrowing it down to one or two would necessarily lead to many peoples concerns being left out. The purpose of the protest is not to push a certain agenda but to let them know that the status quo is unacceptable.
---
As for the timing, I could say that I wanted to build a movement in the first rush of excitement before it had time to splinter. But the truth is I didn't decide to do it until last night.
---
If it fails, it fails and I agree that without a precipitating event it will be difficult.
---
Doubtful.
---
That's all bignull bureaucratic bullshit. I didn't say there wasn't fights to be had, there just wasn't interesting fights to have. And that it's not the same kind of content or playstyle you'd get in a small/nomadic pirate alliance either.
---
My evaluation is that you're the type of person who watches CNN/NBC/Fox and takes their word as gospel and vehemently bashes anything that doesn't agree with the side that they support, conveniently ignoring fact and objective outlooks in the quest to try and convince themselves, and others, that they're on the 'right side'. 
---
Someone who clearly has reading comprehension issues as well (but then again, people who just drink Kool Aid and worship the party line tend to be like that), since I've already stated multiple times I haven't really played since 2014.
---
So I'm actually literally not having *your* shit, I hope the Kool Aid tastes good tho
---
See, you keep saying we're allowed to complain about CCP but then changing your mind.  That front page *is* us complaining.  When the actual topic you're whinging about comes up (should new players start?), it's always universally positive.  Basically you just want us to stop saying stuff you don't like.
---
Dude, you think you're super smart.
---
My post is about the PLAYER BASE not needing to convince new players that the game is dead.
---
I didn't ask if CCP was doing more, I didn't ask about CCP, and I specificially did not ask you about CCP.
---
I said the player base is causing players to reconsider joining the game. I know other things may do so, but telling me ABOUT those other things is not a counter point.
---
No, dude, a counter point is that the communities mindset is helping new players, or that the communities posts are purely joking and have no real effect. But instead,
---
Your here talking about CCP because you never stopped to actually learn the conversation you thrust yourself into.
---
READ THE POST.
---
The problem is, as always, Malcanis.  No matter what you do along these lines it always hurts new players and smaller organizations more than it does established players and larger organizations.  This just further reinforces the status quo, strengthening those already strong relative to those weaker groups who might otherwise assail them.

Please consider adding  [https://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/](https://eve-gatecheck.space/eve/)  which is a nice way to check your path for a trip r/t gate kills, kill in the system, etc.
---
I read the post, and your escalating rants of responses.
---
People disagree with you, and you expect them to simply not respond?
---
You're either a troll or not interested in a genuine debate. People heard you and disagreed on some points.
---
That's a problem you could solve , so ....
---
I am looking forward to this guy's post about CODE in the near future.
---
&gt; That would mean a large alliance would have to commit a number of people to defence rather than generating isk.
---
a large alliance really wouldn't, they'd probably generate more in tax revenue than the cost to repair.
---
and if they didn't then the costs for the smaller guys are going to be obscenely crippling.
---
This is a fair point, but can't the big guys already wreck structures owned by the little guys easily if they wanted to?
---
no.
---
damage cap, and multiple reinforce timers. unless you can't field enough guys to hit a damage cap it's exactly as hard for a small group to reinforce a structure as it is for a large group.
---
&gt; Combat Wombat is trying to take CE with the Help of Darkness 
---
Help? Darkness?

You play eve ?
---
Not really there are plenty of ways to do it / change the meta.  What we don't know is what CCP's goals are.
---
Hopefully the following:
---
1) Making a police skin for the catalyst
---
2) See 1
---
I consider it a corollary, that anything meant to hurt big groups and older players inevitably hurts smaller groups and newer players more.
---
Am as surprised as you. But looking at kills up to now it would indeed seem so
---
That's about the only fight those guys are going to bring. Btw, QFC policy is that each alliance has to have a low power structure at every star in their system which indicates SOV control. Just start blowing up their structures and forcing a fight.
---
Zkill is weird on mobile anyway. It doesn't load the full screen so I never bother.
---
we have been. We have also deleted some of their TCU's and Ihubs and wont stop till every member of the QFC is purged. Its a group of people that are under a false sense of protection. We are here to shove it in their faces that they are garbage tier.
---
They are being evicted by 10 guys that multibox, its sad. Their SOTA had more members on comms then NSH has had in the past year.
---
There's plenty of people that don't read usernames.  Don't be a dick.
---
Fuck you. My shit doesn't need fixing because my attitude is NOT what causes new players to leave. Calling people out on their bullshit is not wrong. And the drivel you are spouting is pure bullshit.
---

People would just bring more cynos.
---
But there, that wasn't so hard. You at least presented some ideas.
---
Poorly thought out ones, but it's a start!
---
Didn’t see that, I stopped reading at “devs’ hard work” PepeLaugh
---
We don't really know what will actually work though.
---
Fuck off retard, and read this thread
---
THAT IS LITERALLY WHAT WE DO YOU IGNORANT FUCK.
---
We see issues, we bring them up, you make effort posts bitching that we are bitching.
---
Depends on the goal.  Some are harder than others.
---
It was a chart they released on Twitter, probably same one you saw.
---
What do you mean? The killmail page has the same information on mobile as what's on the desktop version. The difference is that it's missing all the external links and stats pages for characters, corps and alliances.

His whole argument is complete nonsense cause he's perfectly happy with all the other renters being on the list
---
Which part of Eve's marketing department do you work for? I'll wait. Please link proof since you clearly now all the ins and outs of the company and are using that as the main foundation of your argument, that something you obviously don't know, and are not involved in.

Visit wh, it's fun here!

ps Sorry for stuck window on top left, but it happens.

is that a hint at Drifter clothing sets ?

That's gaming subs in general and I don't get why. I guess most people use online gaming as an outlet to inflict their feelings of worthlessness on others?

yeah i'm like legit so confused. in one fight I saw both sides bring muninns, and in some other fight later on I saw both sides bring eagles, like what the fuck.

Tbh i've no idea what's hapening here but about Darkness Sort dragon doesn't give a fuck to his allies.

Front page. POST #3 and #5 last I checked are both dead game, post 1&amp;2 are stickies.
---
You are a member of this sub reddit correct?
---
200LP is a fair bit though
---
edit: wait 200 or 200k
---
&gt;You didn't make an argument about why the r/eve complaints are more damaging to player retention than CCP actions, you merely stated it. Therefore, no one can respond to your argument
---
Yes I did, literally the very beginning of the post. I'm a new player being discouraged. I made myself the example. Are you actually serious?
---
So you want even less injection? Even better. How far would you like to go? Complete removal?
---
&gt;People would just bring more cynos.
---
How does that avoid say a 5 min delay?
---
&gt;But there, that wasn't so hard. You at least presented some ideas.
---
They are not ideas. Game will die unless they fix it.
---
&gt;Poorly thought out ones, but it's a start!

You didnt say anything about the bots. Do you support bots?
---
excav drones aren't 1b anymore and haven't been for a while

No, they argued CCP is shit, which has nothing to do with my post.
---
Or they argued CCP is too blame, not my post.
---
Or they argued I wans't experienced enough to criticize the game, which I in fact wasn't, and was not my post.
---
Did you actually read my post before reading their replies?
---
Hope you lot enjoy :)
---
People have leftover eagles
---
boosters in eve is just another commodity, and even if they were illegal they are not as hot as irl drugs

I might be the only one asking that but .... I wonder how he got in the middle of the table...
---
Alright. 500m and 6 hours of mining for every full on afk 20 or 40 minutes. Doesn't change the fact that full on afk in them is pretty stupid.
---
Watching the game die?
---
lol, which of your structures comes has a hull timer that day?
---
You keep repeating yourself, and I'm literally telling you, as a new player, with 2 posts sitting on the front page about how this game is dead, and this subreddit is toxic to new players, and you just keep repeating yourself. 
---
If you don't want to listen that's fine, but replying and replying and having me clarify ELI5 for you over and over is getting old. You get out or you don't. I'm the example right here in your face, dude. Open your eyes

Pamfam had equal Titan numbers than Goons in X47 and they got crushed.
---
Pandafam had more Titans than Legacy in UALX and they got crushed.
---
They didn't lose a war because they had less titans, they lost the war because Doomchinchilla was literally throwing.
---
IDK what point you're trying to make here but eves marketing department has outright said we're better at advertising than they are bud. 
---
Some of us have been here for a while, its nice you're new and all but maybe you should get the lay of the land before giving out ideas.
---
Cause right now with this thread you just look like a dumbass.
---
People have mentioned most of the big reasons why you haven’t seen big dread balls yet, but there’s a few I haven’t seen yet.
---
1) escalation order matters a lot. Except for maybe keepstar fights, groups usually bring in titans as a last resort and/or when they’re confident there’s no response ready. Outside of huge fights you usually see this as a response *after* dread bombs are dropped to deal with fax’s for sub support
---
2) related to #1, the range issue can be huge. Titans can get dropped at range to deal with dreads with minimal threat. In addition titans can be spread out while dreads will be more or less immobile. This can be somewhat mitigated by doing what you mentioned (bringing in multiple balls of dread fleets), but that brings up another issue...
---
3) getting one well positioned cyno mid fight can be challenging let alone 4-6 to surround a group. The chances that at least one will be out of position and/or that targets will be out of optimal for different groups is pretty high, which can really impact the effective number of dreads.
---
I’d like to see dreads reign supreme and giant fleets of titans die, but I think we’re a long way off from that actually happening in game, even though the numbers are *a bit* more promising now.
---
So I'm an ignorant fuck, great debate tool BTW, that is reaching out to show you the childish things you're doing to piss in CCPs cereal is fucking with the people you don't want to hurt. The players. 
---
But your just angry, and screaming at people that there, what was it again? Oh yea, ignorant fucks.
---
Damn, all your suggestions are retarded
---
HOW DARE SOMEBODY DRAW IN AIR THROUGH THEIR MOUTH RIGHT?!?!??!

---
cmon bud, most people watch movies and or play other games while they mine, Ive never met a rorq that just sits there minding his shit all day, and when i tried to do exactly that it nearly killed my soul.
---
You truly are new here. You should have seen Eve 8 years or 10 years ago.. you would understand what was, what has been, and what was lost. 
---
I’m glad you enjoy the game, it still has some magic left, yet not as much as before.
---
Well, it is now.
---
Tried running 64-bit clients?
---
No, don't avoid it. Where's your CCP employee paper work?
---
You know exactly what point in making, don't claim bullshit and change the topic when you get called on it. You don't work for CCP, and the occasional gaming article is great, but to say the players provide nearly if not all the actual advertisement for the game is absurd.
---
What is it im claiming to know? What is it that I'm saying the more experienced players are wrong about? Pick two and I'll enlighten you in why you didn't read the post.
---
The big guy can, however, outform the little guy and outright kill the structures. That isn't something the little guy can do to the big guy.
---
Giving the little guy *some* ability to inflict actual damage would be positive. Rather than as it is right now where the little guy can't do anything to the big guy whatsoever.
---
You mean meta 4 being the best, meta 5 is T2.
---
I don't know if this is really fair.  They certainly came out to play earlier this morning.  
---
Granted, they fed us like we were Mr. Creosote...
---
Dude, make a post saying this on the front page.
---
Instead of EVE DAED GEAM.
---
And then, just maybe, will the subreddit grow out of this prepubescent phase of angst and rebellion.
---
Your game would convince players to stay, and might encourage CCP to look at changes.
---
DAED GAEM, does the opposite.
---
The game company said it retard, not me, and I dont need paperwork to understand english when its spoken to me (even when it has an icelandic accent).
---
You see most of us have been here long enough to know most of the employees at CCP because *most of them were players we played with before working there*.
---
So if you want my paperwork, reach up your ass and look for it, I've got 14 years of working with this company to know more than enough about its functionality.  You're talking to people on a subreddit who go over CCP's finances once a fucking year mongoloid, you know literally nothing about the people you're talking to or the company you're talking about when all of us actually do.
---
So heres a little help from me to you, dont get comfortable in the game, CCP has ran it right into the ground and its in its death throes now.  Feel free to fuck off early.

OP nailed it.

---
And then you tell the new player whose going to help continue this game one option. Fuck off.
---
You do realize that your the problem right?
---
Ah so now fights have to meet your subjective criteria of “interesting”.   Please continue to move the goalposts around your hooked shots.  No one can see that for what it is.  
---
Where in this thread replying to me you’ve said you haven’t played in 5 years?   And what the fuck then makes you think your opinion means shit about current events if you can’t be bothered to play the game?  None of this “big null bureaucracy” or any form or thoughtless regurgitation of a gospel.  This is all based on my own observations in my Corp as part of test.  First hand and current.  Not heresay, outdated, filtered or any of your jaded perspectives.   
---
Had I seen that earlier I would have completely written you off then.  But please feel free to continue to throw your stupid outdated opinions around to people genuinely asking for advice.  Which you cannot offer objectively since you don’t have a clue about the current state of the game.  You just get the shit on here.

how about they just make them less aids to kill and interact with instead of creating irrelevant costs

God fucking damn, I thought I was running the 64-bit client already, did not know it was still in a testing phase, thought it was automatically updated. Thanks for mentioning it, just activated the setting and my client seems to be running a lot faster with it active.
---
Oh, I'm not disagreeing there. But you can set a VNI afk for 20 minutes and it won't die. You are risking drones on a rorqual if you do that. They are just shades of boredom that probably do actually appeal to some people that don't want to focus or have limited motor functions I guess. I am still a proponent of carriers being the apex because of all of the input. I very much like the idea of rewarding the most interactive play.
---
Thats the only one I got, sadly
---
Its not a problem, CCP fucked its player base over as you can plainly see from the other replies you've seen to your thread.|
---
Also welcome to EVE, im not required to be nice to you unless you fucking earn it shit sack.
---
You want proof, look up "this is eve", its a trailer for EVE that CCP made, then go find that years fanfest bullshit and watch the speech CCP gives about trailer and why its the way it is.  
---
It can be another 'welcome to eve' moment for you, nobody else here is ever going to do the work for you, you're told something, you go explore it, I'm not your teacher nor do i work for you so you can either look it up or wander out into heavy traffic, neither will bother me at all.

And yea, I dont like you at all, in the slightest bit, you're an apologist sack of dog shit.

i have 272 million sp trained the old fashioned way, playing for over a decade, mastery 5 in quite literally every subcapital, and i can honestly say i dont think ive ever even sat in a VNI, i'll take your word for it.

Also yea the mining needs to be more interactive.  Like ELITE went way too fucking far, its worse, but what we have now is like watching snails eat dog food.

OK not one did I ask any one to be nice, or do any of that. Your ranting in a mirror right now man.

Not yet, have  not seen any good feedback, or seen a solid reason to use. Most 64 bit clients use more memory and run slower than their 32 bit cousins if you have not bumped up against the 4GB memory limit of 32 but clients (which we have not)

That single procurer would need to be plexed. Alphas can't use mining barges. And I doubt you'd make much money beyond plexing the account. If any. When you do 3 hours a day 5 days a week.
---
I was running them, it was fine, launcher had a meltdown and I needed to re-add everything. Apparantly it has also checked off my 64bit client option. Suddenly I was running 100% CPU, 100% GPU and it would drop my connection every single time. At some point somebody mentioned "are you running 64? Yes I am, double-checked, fuck me apparantly not anymore. Put it back on, running multiple client on high settings just fine again.
---
I have to say, you put a lot more effort into a bait post than most people I see on reddit. Props for that, I guess.
---
Admirable, but PHorde/BN/Karma being the defacto destinations for newbies and so funnelling new players into the large null blocs is pretty bad for the game's diversity. Small/Mid-size alliances can't compete with the convenience offered, (never mind all the other ways they can't compete) and so don't attract new players and cannot rise to being in meaningful contention.
---
Sorry dude, you don't have any clue what you're talking about. If you ever make it past your first year you'll start to realize why we act the way we do. We love this game more than anything, and we have all grown to become like this because of it.
---
Let me put it this way, you don't walk into a biker bar and tell them to stop being rough characters because it effects the people around them badly. There is a reason they are that way, and they don't want it any other way. That is what draws us to this game, it is a special kind of degenerate that we all like and identify with. If you don't like it, you don't have to stick around, but don't expect anyone to give your opinions any credit when you have so little experience with it.
---
WI. is the best 。
---
Pot meet kettle.
---
Checkmate I guess.....
---
The problem is the years of content you're looking at haven't been improved on in many meaningful ways in a long time.
---
Pve in null sec and empire space hasn't changed much in years (faction warfare hasn't received meaningful iterations in nearly a decade for example). Wormhole space got a decent update a couple years back which basically shook it up for a couple months, and now it's back to the same old.
---
Rorqual balance, skill injectors and many other factors are obvious issues that ccp has refused to address. This has lead to everyone proliferating capital alt after capital alt, so the amount of content for smaller groups has slowly started to starve.
---
With all these extra caps, large groups basically fortify and other than the yearly morale war, nullsec space is nowhere near as active as it could be.
---
Balance changes have been decently iterative, but once flaws are discovered they sit there open for years before anything happens.
---
There aren't hundreds of professions, or jobs anymore. Even events have almost become cookie cutter loot drops with worse and worse rewards.
---
Ccp has shown time and time again the incredible potential in this game, and in an overwhelming majority of cases, they never make it out of the bottom half of the potential well.
---
You don't get it because you're new here. These vets you insult are people who have played the game for years, and despite all the negativity, cock waving and insulting... *they love this game*.
---
In my case, I started playing eve consistently in 2009. I found my niche, played, made memes, became memes, had fun, lost it all, rebuilt it all and have gaming stories that you will never get to experience because the falling potential of this game.
---
Most of the vets here have grown and changed so much over the course of their lives in this game that its brought good and bad things out.
---
To long term vets, I can say things like Moo, red alliance, Polaris, vile rat, rage, monaclegate or dozens of other things and share a story. For people like yourself, you will likely never experience moments that will be regarded in eve lore.
---
So you need to understand where we're coming from, and who cares if you have 25+ years of gaming experience, you need to check your ego and learn some of the stuff we've been through.
---
So sit down, shut up, and learn. Then maybe you'll truly appreciate this game.
---
Inductive fallacy. You're taking 1 anecdote and generalizing it to be your conclusion without additional evidence.
---
worth a shot, would be a shame if ccp let the 32bit client go pear shape just to persuade people to move to the 64 bit one.
---
Not sure: if you introduce a penalty it might encourage more risk adverse behaviour....
---
These need to be plexed. And yes. With enough hours mining this would work. But with mediocre barge skills you won't be pulling a plex every month when mining 3 hours a day 5 days per week.
---
They are a bit hit or miss, rifters lack range and rely on speed and ramming. Wolf packs in smaller groups work well, more in a small gang style but they suffer from the same issues as rifters if you have a lot of them
---
Eve wouldn't have marketing if it weren't for the player's stories... And maybe you should learn who you're talking to before spouting off. Just reply with your favourite kind of ice cream.

---
Don't need to worry about irradiation in many regions, there's already fallout there. I would be curious what kind of mass of bananas would be needed to collapse into a black hole or start fusion though.
---
Then leave. We don't want numbers, we want quality. And you are definitely not quality.
---
I am not sure if I ever used a VNI, I was in high sec far too long and did the battleship in L4 thing until a carrier before the fighters. I rather like fighter mechanics. I would be all for in depth mining interaction that even had opportunities for special ore finds or whatever. The more focused someone is on the mining mini game the less they watch intel and local.
---
Good job killing those rats! before we can give you your reward I need you to click all the boxes that have a streetlight in them.
---
20k dps tank is actually half a fax in triage, and completely manageable, speaking as someone who spends a significant time ingame trying to kill them. 
---
What is bullshit is the invulnerability mod - it should ideally a) immediately shut down any lit cyno/prevent the lighting of cyno when active OR b) only protect the barges around the rorq, not the rorq itself. (bonus option c) just remove it entirely, invulnerability timers of any nature are shit gameplay design in multiplayer games).
---
They shouldn't die to any roaming gang, but a deliberate effort to kill them should be more rewarding then sitting there watching a blue bubble and a cyno, waiting for a capital blob.
---
I am brand new to the game but have been reading a bunch of guides.
---
Can I make my main account both combat (pve first to start but pvp down the road) and mining focused? Or is it better to split them between an alt?
---
ahh the common "i have no counter argument so ill just say you suck"
---
When has that ever stopped ncdot from dropping straggler titans???
---
You forgot to count the permit price
---
Lmao almost all of your are guilty of this.
---
This is EVE you only know how it works if you've played the game a bunch.
---
Replies like these go to show A. You didn't read the post, and B. This isn't a fucking biker bar, it's a gaming company you fool. And lastly,
---
C. This is A BUSINESS. Bitching and complaining only goes so far, but if you LIKE the product, you will bitch and complain in a WAY THAT DOESN'T REDUCE FUTURE BUYING POTENTIAL.
---
Practically all of you are looking at this big scary game like children and forgetting its a business, and your tactic of complaining is directly hurting business. Instead, use intelligence and social networking, to boost business, then worry about the fucking changes. The forethought on this, coming out of what I thought was an intelligent player base, is starting to become rediculous.
---
Think ahead people, if no one plays the game CCP will never fix it. Players first, RETAIN those players, then fixes. Every ounce of incentive for CCP comes from THE PLAYER COUNT.
---
If you need me to repeat this ELI5, just ask.
---
There's currently rather a dearth of small gang content triggers, alas...
---
Getting caught on multiple toons on exact the same timer and a week later on +15 seconds is a bot, yes.
---
If that is the only way to jump sub-capitals around, it would actually limit projection a bit
---
it opens up like in a bar, you can see it on 0:17
---
Right, cause they won't be bouncing safes just as fast as they are warping to citadel.
---
thanks
---
Implying the people on that list don't have the IQ of an undefended pos
---
bots do not bounce safes, they are extremely easy to catch if they use the safe spot method.
---
I think im informing you of my opinion of you as a person, how is it not working, is english not your primary language?
---
This is true but it offsets the cost slightly and they can doPI or basic reactions for 2 weeks extra training for near passive income (doing carbides is 100m per week per character where I’m doing it right now). Having 4 doing that it’s 1.6b extra month + barge mining. It won’t profit on plex price but if your serious about Isk making you will cross train the 2 alts per account for reaction or PI it gives you a nice side hustle with minimal effort
---
If you wanna argue against that, explain this to me:

I concur

nice to see you still doing your thing o/
---
I'm not the developer looking into Mac support, so I'm not sure as to the status.  But, I know it's being worked on.
---
If you can't catch them in sites because they warp out too fast, then I don't see how you gonna scan them down when they keep bouncing  safes. Just because now they only warp to one spot (citadel) won't stop them from doing it multiple times. It's a race of arms just like any other. Hell, I'd be all for an in-game captcha that you gotta fill every hour or so of ratting. That'd be more effective than any other mechanic I've seen mentioned so far. That or negative wallets for corps/alliances associated with the botters.
---
o/ Neckbeard, we passed you in our bomber fleet on the way home last night.
---
where should the astra be anchored to take on the drifter?
---
This is not true. A busier and more competitive environment is good for all play styles. A more populated universe is great for most PVE functions both in terms of human interaction and higher demand for the products you produce. 
---
Eve is a pretty terrible single-player game. Sitting on an empty server without the potential for human interaction is not good gameplay.
---
I swear I thought that this would be the very first comment. I'm amazed it took this long.
---
This is dumb.
---
Games get quality via MONEY. players bring money. Your passion for balance changes doesn't bring money. You have so much to say for someone with so little to offer.
---
Right, because code can't be changed so that they keep bouncing. Just because they aren't doing it now (because they don't have to thanks to tether mechanics) doesn't mean they won't adapt in the easiest and most obvious way.
---
I want citadels to die in a fire. They shit up Eve and made it too safe.

ya well, you can count on goons to make all the best low effort shitposts eventually :)

Yes, please, repeat your broken record, hostile ELI5 that nobody asked for or cares about. You walk in here talking about something you don't know anything about like you have all the answers. Have you been around to see the trials and tribulations that eve players have dealt with when it comes to CCP? Do you even know what monoclegate and the summer of rage is? You asked for calm reasoning and replied to it with an overabundance of emotion and actual lack of knowledge.
---
As usual, armchair developers such as yourself come to places like this to vent in one way or another and pretend there is one thing causing something else, when in reality it is always more complicated than that. If that was your only fault here, I would give you the benefit of the doubt, since that happens all the damn time. However, the obvious way in which you've continuously stuck your head in the sand despite literally the entire sub telling you that you're wrong (especially when this sub as a whole RARELY agrees on ANYTHING) brings true clarity to how much of a self centered prick you really are, so forgive me if I don't care about retaining players like yourself.

They've never done it, like long before citadels existed you could kill a bot if it warped to a safe and you knew what you were doing with probes. Having never used a bot program i have no clue as to why they don't, but they just don't.   You would assume that they would change that code since so many have died over the years in that way but as far as I can tell its never been modified in anyway, just warp to safe, cloak.

At E3 last week the main thing Hilmar (CCP CEO) talked about was a mobile Eve game being developed with Chinese publisher NetEase.

There has been a ton of good feedback, it runs way smoother with two clients on my underpowered system.

Cool video, for those of you watching and paying attention, if you ever reload an ancillary repairer, also repair the mods not in use - they'll usually repair to full on or before your repairer is reloaded. Worst case you can cancel the repair and your mods will have less damage.
---
Man that would be cool as fuck. Someone should set up a corp like that and be the change we want to see in terms of making Bounty Hunting a proper career path ahead of any potential future changes to bounties (lol it's CCP, so probably not likely any time soon or ever).

Is it bad that this made me laugh?

Yes, when you are old and lived with 8+ years of super capital advantage, you won't understand why people are getting fed up of the game.  Heck chances are you're still in nullsec thinking muninns and stuff are cool, or spinning a Vanquisher thinking of how epic it will be to undock again.
---
Best comment ever! I spat food out laughing so hard!
---
So I was right, your grievance is your petulant disagreement with the opinions of others, and blaming those personal opinions for new players not joining in or sticking around. Not any actually substantive thing or event that got your panties wrinkled.
---
Got it.

Which implies that we've lost more in the opportunity cost of lost mining ops than we have in actual losses.

"Your personal opinions"
---
Are you college educated? Do you understand business? Do you understand all products need a base of consumers to stay afloat? Do you understand that EVE is a product? Do you comprehend the simple concept that player count incentivices financial commitment?
---
No, you probably dont. Instead you clearly think that my argument lacks substance, even though you literally have offered nothing but a complete lack of understanding my post.
---
Player make EVE money. Money makes EVE develop. Development brings fixes, changes, balance.
---
This general EVE mentality pushes PLAYERS away from EVE, amongst other things, but my post is focused on YOU. The player.
---
Pushing players away pushes money away.
---
Pushing money away pushes developement away.
---
Do I need to continue?
---
Oh thank god. That'll rejuvenate the game.
---
Yup. I wonder which way it goes first, as far as denial of content trends are concerned?
---
This game feels like a ghost town of bots, campers, and nothing else but a few tryhard flag wavers right now. Reminds me of the dying days of Dark Age of Camelot.
---
Ok, so I have quite a bit of experience flying active Rattles in C3s. Here's my breakdown of how I fit them. A lot of the fits are just different ways of tackling the same problem, with neither being right or wrong. Sorry for the long post. I've tried to make it skimmable, but detailed.
---
**TLDR:** Read the bullet points. The paragraph after each bullet point explains the bullet in more detail.
---
**DPS/Tank/Cap Requirements** - As a genral rule of thumb, I aim for at least 650 ehp/s tank for c3 anoms and 850 ehp/s tank for data/relics. DPS should be higher than that - the higher the better. You also need to be cap stable with some overhead for neuts. Anomolies cap the neuts at -24 gj/s while data/relic sites go up to -44 gj/s. Your neut overhead doesn't need to be more than that, rather just high enough to withstand the pressure long enough for you to kill the rats.
---
**Also as a general note**, whenever I mention DPS or EHP numbers, that is for a mostly T2 build with a deadspace shield booster. No real bling except for the reps.
---
* Cruise Missiles or Rapid Heavies
---
This choice is probably the most distinctive choice you'll make with the rattle build, each option runs the sleeper sites very differently than the other. Cruise missiles have longer range (easily hitting past 100km) and do overall more DPS over time on paper, but they struggle to apply that DPS to smaller targets, especially frigates. Rapid heavies can apply DPS to smaller ships much easier do a lot more burst DPS, but have an extremely long reload time and have a "short" range of ~60km at max skills. (Sleepers typically spawn at over 100km out and the farthest sleepers orbit at 65km.) What this means is that the cruise missile fit can sit in one spot and hit F1, while the rapid heavy fit will have to constantly be moving around to keep the farther sleepers in range.
---
* Heavy Drones or Sentry Drones
---
TBH, I'm very biased towards regular drones, so I don't have a lot of personal experience with sentry drones. I have heard it said that you should match one long range weapon with a short range weapon - i.e. Heavy Drones with Cruise Missiles and Sentry Drones with Rapid Heavies. Pros of sentries would be that you can drop them and they will immediately start applying DPS to the target, whereas the heavy drones would need to fly out to the target first. Cons of sentries is that they have poor tracking with targets up close and you need to move your ship to them to scoop them. Sleepers WILL target your drones at some point, so proper drone micro is important and you need to be prepared to scoop them if they start getting redboxed.
---
* Drone Link Augmentator? Maybe. A must-have with Rapid Heavies.
---
Again, the farthest sleepers orbit at 65km, which is farther than your drone control range, therefore you should consider using a drone link augmentator. When you're cruise missile fit, the drone link augmentator is very nice, but not necessary. There are very few sleepers that actually do orbit at 65km, so your cruise missiles can take care of those and your drones can focus on the majority of closer targets. On the other hand, if you're Rapid heavy fit, the drone link augmentator is a MUST. Your rapid heavies cannot hit that far out, so you need something that can.
---
* MJD or other utility mids? Only if you have the space.
---
An MJD is an easy way to escape if you get dropped on. It's also very useful to reposition yourself to either a) get closer to your target to apply DPS faster, even if you jump past them or b) move yourself away from the signature so that any would-be gankers would have to slowboat ~100km towards you to get tackle. The only downside to it is that it removes a module from your tank, which typically is fairly tight. It's definitely possible to have the extra slot open while keeping your tank high enough for the site AND stay cap stable with the neut pressure, but this isn't always an option. The same can be said for other utility mids - painters, webs, grapplers, scrams, etc. You need to weigh the pros that the module would give you, while still keeping both your tank and cap high enough.
---
* 500mn MWD? It wrecks your cap, even with it off. Much better for PvP.
---
500mn microwarpdrive is a completely different beast than the other utility mids. It's very helpful for moving around on grid, especially when you have rapid heavies and need to close distance. The downside is that it completely destroys your cap stability, even with it turned off. And cap stability is a MUST for these sites. It is definitely possible to make your fit cap stable again with a 500mn mwd, but that would require something more like [BjornBee's "magic" cap-stable PvP Rattlesnake](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75687152/), which is a very different setup than a PvE Rattlesnake. That build can do the content on paper (it has good enough dps/tank/cap numbers), but it's a lot less effective at running it quickly, since it was designed for PvP. That type of build would be a great bait fit though, especially in C2s.
---
* T2 Shield Booster? Not worth it.
---
As was mentioned elsewhere in the comments, if there is one thing you should always consider blinging out, it's your reps. For reference, my current c3 rattlesnake build can rep about 900 - 1200 ehp/s with max skills depending on if you add a MJD or not. If you bump that down to a T2, that repair amount plummets down to 550 - 750 ehp/s, which makes it well below my ehp/s target of 650 for anoms with an MJD, and below the 850 ehp/s target for relic/data sites without one. So I really highly recommend to bling your reps, it helps so much with your fit.
---
If you absolutely must use a T2 repper, use the Gist philosophy below. But, keep in mind that it does worse reps, has worse cap and is just generally inferior in every way. You won't be cap stable with the neuts and the repper on, but your high raw hp will in theory make up for it as long as you don't cap yourself out with your repper.
---
* Pith X-Type or Gist B-Type Large Shield Booster
---
So, since blinging your reps is so beneficial, there are two deadspace modules that are commonly used that gets the reps up high enough. Both have different build philosophies.
---
**Pith X-Type Large Shield Booster** - This is a much stronger repper in terms of raw HP, but it also takes a lot more cap to run. I make this cap stable by putting 2 Republic Fleet Cap Batteries in the mids, 2 Capacitor Flux Coils in the lows, and the rest in Capacitor Control Circuits for rigs. Remember that the cap batteries add neut resistance, so you don't need as much overhead for the neuts. This also needs either one or two Shield Boost Amplifiers to get the tank numbers up high enough.
---
**Gist B-Type Large Shield Booster** - This is a much less powerful repper in terms of raw HP, but makes up for it by requiring a lot less cap. It only requires 3 Capacitor Flux Coils in the lows and 1 or 2 Capacitor Control Circuits in the rigs in order to be cap stable with some overhead for neuts. The lower reps amount should be counterbalanced by having very high resists. Your rattle has weaker EM and Thermal resists, so you need to fill those holes to be most effective. This also needs either one or two Shield Boost Amplifiers to get the reps up high enough. An Operational Solidifier rig also helps get the ehp/s up. Keep in mind that since this does not require cap batteries to run, you won't get the added neut resistance like the Pith build does. So be careful about your cap. 60%+ cap stability is fairly typical for this build. If you want to add a cap battery, you can squeeze in one or two Screen Reinforcer rigs to help fill your resist holes to free up the midslot.
---
* Pith X-Type XL Shield Booster? Absolutely! (if you can fit it)
---
Remember when I said there are two different deadspace modules that are typically used? Well, I lied. There are actually 3. The last one is the Pith X-Type XL Shield Booster. This follows the same philosophy as the Pith X-Type Large Shield Booster, except the reps are a lot stronger than either of the Pith Large or Gist Large. Remember the 900 - 1200 ehp/s numbers that I mentioned earlier? Yeah, that's a Pith XL build. I have only managed to get the Pith Large and the Gist Large up to about 900 ehp/s with max skills and no MJD. Plus, the XL is about 100m cheaper than the Pith Large. So why not the Pith XL? Well, like the Pith, it requires a lot of cap. And since it's an oversized module, it requires even more cap and fitting space than the Pith Large, to the point that it becomes very difficult to fit at all. So if you can fit it, go for it. However, that doesn't mean that the Pith Large or the Gist Large are any less capable of doing the content. I generally make the Pith XL cap stable with 2 Republic Fleet Large Cap Batteries, 1 Cap Recharger, 2 Cap Flux Coils, and Capactior Control Circuits for rigs.
---
* Everything else is up to you
---
That should cover the majority of the fitting space as far as your cap and tank is concerned. The rest is up to your own preference. Other options for lows include a Damage Control for more tank, Ballistic Control Systems/Drone Damage Amplifiers for more DPS, the C3-A/C3-X Ballistic Control System for a combined BCS/DDA (the C3-X being more blingy), and Missile Guidence Enhancers for extra range/application (esp good for rapid heavies - can increase range to 70km). This is not an exhaustive list, but just stuff that I keep coming back to when fiddling with my builds.
---
Anyway, if you have any questions or want to see my actual Pith, Gist, or Pith XL fits, feel free to ask.
---
Lol you shooting us wasn't the problem. It actually made me a better pilot. You anchoring structures and shooting our staging citadel is what's called an eviction. 
---
Either way, you made your bed. Now enjoy lying in it while the other 2/3 of EVE gives you the middle finger. :)
---
Thank mr darwin
---
You just called me an "armchair developer".
---
Instant disqualification - i offered not ONE example of balance change. I offered a change in the community. the players. You have so much to say yet literally have no idea what the conversation is about.
---
I like you too!
---
what's easier is cancelling your subs and playing other games where it's easier to have fun.
---
This is beyond dumb.
---
This is called marketing your moron. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIhIMizrkWk
---
Software doesn't maintain itself, and not everything worth doing to keep it up to date is a headline feature.
---
In particular, failure to do the work to get Eve running on a current-generation graphics API would mean a panic project in a few years when older technology gets deprecated by video card and OS vendors.
---
Man, how will Eve survive without a complainer like you?
---
No it wouldn't.
---
You actually have no understanding of how things work. I don't care how many times people spam "something is great" - if it's not, it's not. Eve is not as good in many ways as it could be, and pretending it is won't make it.
---
Fucking hell.

Its 2019, the loudest most entitled side wins.  They just cried harder it looks like.

Dito... put the money saved into a fishing kayak - so much more fun!

T3C's are already massively nerfed to near uselessness the only reason to use a T3C is because you can't use another hull. 
---
So that means any role where you have to bridge with a blops and well a covert cyno role, otherwise, you can literally use anything else it will be cheaper and have better stats.
---
Calm down f1 pusher, your job is being taken by robots.

I downvoted you simply because you didn't reply with your favourite type of ice cream
---
Are you drunk or, as is more likely, not finished school yet, so as to spell so badly?
---
Regardless, I agree that the OP you replied to is an utter meme.
---
I appreciate your response! People like you make Reddit pretty amazing!
---
How about you just fuck off son
---
Wow, you tried to use a logical fallacy against me, intelligently so, but so unintelligent ended the question.
---
"Do you have evidence that this is a common experience with new player retention, or that it is has a greater effect if new player retention generally than CCP actions?"
---
I never posed for one second that the player base has more influence that CCP. That is a completely seperate question.
---
I posed a very. simple. concept. - Negativity in the community is negatively impacting the game. Period. Other things impact the game negatively, but that is not the topic of discussion at hand.
---
And a common experience? Are you kidding?
---
Most talked about thing with EVE players: CCP is ass

2nd Most talked about with EVE players: the game is dead.

The 64-bit client sees significantly reduced resource usage. Presumably, in writing the 64-bit client, they were able to eliminate some legacy code that was holding the 32-bit client back.

if they didn't introduce skill injectors new players would quit as the gap from them to old players was far too great, if anything it allowed people to get on somewhat equal playing fields

My post is not about game balance. I do say the game is amazing, because it is, in fact, amazing. Maybe it's in a bad state but a lambo in a bad state is still a lambo.

My post is about the constant "dead game" mentality in the community. Please read next time before wasting your time on such a long winded, completely misdirected reply.

You actually have to be bait or 13 years old lmao. This is hilarious. A guy lists the problems with Eve right now and you tell him he's passionate about hating it.

---
Genuinely, can you tell us how old you are?
---
Okay. I'm done. You won.
---
I really liked the part where you refittet to max resists, then proceeded to not turn them on and almost got killed.  
---
Nice job though
---
Oh but John, you said "Eve wouldn't have marketing if it weren't for the player's stories", did you not?
---
Clearly, i didn't ask which marketing was better. And i havent seen those as a new player, I saw the trailer i linked, so from the personal eyewitness account of a new EVE player, at least currently, your wrong.
---
Even then, no one would leave because they are too attached to their progress.
---
That is beatiful. XD
---
Odd, the game survived so long without injectors, what 12-14 years....
---
That being said, I don’t think the intended mechanic was to let someone inject to a Titan. Or that casino guy that live streamed him injecting 0 to lvl 5 in all skills (took a couple hours, but he finished and there was nothing in the game left to train)
---
dude, word to the wise, when more people downvote you over people like me and others, you're not winning the battle here.
---
I wish you the best of luck in eve, but 3 months in 5 years is hardly playing.. i have half a billion skill points between my main characters with 0 injection, i've lived what eve is.
---
&gt;day's

No, I didn't get the memo that typing on a phone meant that people forgot what proofreading is. Nor a memo about autocorrect no longer existing.

And yet you had the audacity to criticise someone else's grammar in their reply.

You are correct! Haven't been able to log in since my office flooded 4 weeks ago and in a bit of a fog with the amount of work a home renovation tasks.
---
Honestly there like double the price of a scimi, have less range than a scimi ( medium vs large reps ) and really have like a 30k ehp advantage for that like if you have to take a blops bridge sure but otherwise I mean it's not really worth running them.
---
Negativity and hate helped make eve what it is. You're just farming hate by posting this shit
---
So a developer doesn't take the game's community into account when designing game changes for them? So then what does the community team do? You have your mind set on us changing, but never even think about why we wouldn't want to change.
---
So once again I'm back to you not understanding us because of how new you are. We like what this is. We want the grit, the conflict, the pessimism, that is what draws us. We will watch this game die before we will let a bunch of handheld babies take over it. This game has problems, lots of them, and if you can't accept that and accept we are going to bitch about them, despite the fact we'll stick around anyways cause that's what we do, then you don't belong here. That is what this game has ALWAYS been.
---
In-Game experience has \*nothing\* to do with this post. I have tried to elaborate on this many, many times. \*READ THE POST\*
---
Jesus, john. Read the post before replying - you keep wasting both of our time
---
No, they're "game is dying on this course, change course NOW" posts.  And they have nothing to do with the question of new players joining, which as we've established is always met positively.  You can read English, correct?
---
"surviving" doesn't necessarily mean good
---
If no progress is lost, no reason to stay... specially if you know some cataclismic even is coming our way or something.
---
This isn't FOX news you dweeb.
---
Ooof, that'll take me a while I think my calculator won't even be able to display such high numbers
---
Wanna compare max number of active players before injectors (50k) with max after injectors (30k and nowadays 20-25k?) before you go down that road?
---
Or are you saying the game now is in the best shape ever?
---
Personally I've always felt Horde &amp; co feed other groups as much as they do their main bloc.  Lots of people cut their teeth there before joining smaller groups, where it can be hard to get started without a decent nest egg and SP profile.  Besides which, a player who joins a bloc is healthier than a player who quits.  The bloc problem is caused by other mechanics (super umbrellas, N+1 titans, cits and timers and sov, etc), newbies ending up there is no different from vets doing the same as their groups are absorbed.  *Everyone* is getting funneled to blocs right now, not just newbies.
---
All of that aside, they're still evidence of Eve players going well out of their way to help newbies with better attitudes than OP's.
---
QFC working as intended then. I hope Goons actually let it happen. May as well evict fatal and the other goobers who have a combined might of 8 cruisers and a hyperion.
---
Except while I was Rorq mining, I was doing it with 5 rorqs 14-18 hours a day. Just used Teamviewer to move them to new rocks and listened for anything that wasn't the sound of rocks dying.

This thread: medieval knights who spent years using their superior martial abilities to slaughter peasants now complaining because the peasants banded together and stocked up on guns.

Nonsense I shot at one dtructure and the guy inside it killed my poor drones
---
Is there a formula somewhere to determine the economies of scale on mats needed for production based on the number of runs ? I can clearly see it exists but I don't really understand how it works.
---
I mean, we haven't really had that problem with them poaching FCs since jump fatigue was introduced.
---
Dank frags
---
Maybe it uses nanites to deconstruct the ammo used in the attack to repair the armor?
---
If you could make a site like osimium or pyfa where you could build fits via browser, the player base will love you (and I would love you).  Right now at work if I wanna make a fit I can only use Evanova which is better than nothing, but far from ideal.
---
Also, once it's up and running feel free to make sure you ask for isk donations, I'd give you a couple bill lol.  Hell you could even make it a isk based paid subscription service and rake in the iskies.
---
I'm confused, what is the point of the log, what are you protesting?
---
Seriously dude? Here's a hint for you: IT'S CALLED COST, NOT RISK.
---
And the cost of a gank is very very low, and extremely disproportionate to reward on all scales, including effort, preparation, and execution. This needs to be put in line.
---
&gt; You guys all have 20 phones right ?
---
Nothing changes if no progress is lost. Can't have one without the other.
---
I think I shot your cyno, I was coming back for the bombers but you were all slightly too quick :)
---
Your right. I did do that. Sue me.
---
For real, looking back every time I took a hiatus from Eve it was because of the gloom and doom that gets spread around here. Last time I quit it was because of all the panic surrounding abyssal modules. 
---
The amount of fear mongering in this sub is dizzying. So much so that I've noticed that unplugging from r/eve every now and then has really improved my enjoyment of the game.
---
I don't think that they have been complacent though, there's been heaps off changes, updates and new things added.
---
Sure there's stuff to do still, but they don't seem complacent or inactive
---
Someone in the other thread said 200 LP and 1.5m isk....LOL.

No, you will. No one else wants the game to die. You stand alone. Stand down.

All I know is as a long time redditor and new eve player, I was super excited to join this subreddit. It's so toxic I can't hardly breathe. Will not be returning. You said it perfectly, it's absurd fear mongering that discourages players, and clearly by your example, not just new ones.
---
First off, posts like this aren't as helpful as you think. This is reddit. Welcome to reddit! You may not be new to reddit, I'm not even checking your profile, but the way you wrote that definitely gives off a "I'm new to reddit! Hi guys!" vibe. So welcome to reddit.  
---
Secondly, most games as big as EVE, especially MMO's, have a vocal minority who speak up more than anyone. Good, bad, whatever. So you are NOT going to see the full spectrum of the playerbase. This kinda nullifies your post right there.  
---
Thirdly, further nullifying your post, negativity, problems, issues, in any medium tend to float to the top, and be seen.  
---
Finally, this is EVE. People are people here. Fuck your other games, other communities, and how they deal with stuff. Most gameplay and people in EVE deal with things as an alternative character. Meaning being an asshole is ok. Lying, cheating, stealing, hacking, is ok. Thats the way the game is, and thus the way the community is. And that is INTENDED.

That last part is the most important. Society IRL is not society in EVE. And it bleeds into all other communications around it. I would take a long look at that part of this game, and analyze yourself again whether or not you'd like to commit. It's a hell of an amazing game, but your post basically tells me "I'm not going to be able to handle the social aspects of EVE online". Or it tells me you will be a permanent solo player. Or you can just play the game and have that same attitude, but I wouldn't expect it to go far.
---
The nice side of me says good luck to ya wherever you go. But the realistic side of me says getting on the reddit of game you are finally trying to start playing more and then bashing everyone in there and calling everyone guilty of something? Yeah you can fuck right off and go play Fortnite or whatever the fuck else.

Thanks for the clarification.

Now I know that if I just jump between two ansiblex-connected systems each hour, creating positive delta in the one I left, and negative delta an hour later when I come back, because I did nothing there, only ratting in negative delta system, I can completely avoid dumbasses who look at delta.
---
And FYI, there is no way in hell any single ship can generate +1500, not even super, not even close.
---
Player proposed rebalance idea is quite a common thing on basically all gaming forums
---
I think that's quite normal, people like come up with ideas, shitty or not

Hello skill injectors.

So impressive, ready for next step :-)
---
Man you are the biggest brainlet to ever brainlet. I admire your tenacity.
---
At least with a pos you have chance they forget to fuel it or it can be killed without them realizing perhaps
---
Considering that I manage more coherent thought than nearly every other subhuman pond scum excuse for a human being in this pedophile warren, I'll take that as a compliment.
---
Lol look, it's another legacy victim.
---
Your better one is ... ?
---
Most of the people being cunts are the ones who have played the game for over 10 years that think CCP owes them something for being such loyal customers for so long. Fuck them. There are ones who want iwin buttans. Fuck them. There are those who can't adapt, and cry because that's how they were brought up in life. Fuck them too.
---
Eve has been dying since 2008. Most of those people end up quitting anyways, who gives a fuck about a hater.not me.
---
Never said I had a better one, just saying this one is retarded.

1) I'm not responsible for CCP's financial success/stability, I am a customer and I am free to air my grievances with the actions of the service provider to which I compensate financially. So to argue that it is my or anyone else's responsibility is completely fucking asinine.
---
2) You missed the part where I laid out the complaint that CCP has been taking the money we pay them for EvE and squandered it on failed business venture after failed business venture to the point where they had so much debt to service they had to sell themselves to a fucking Korean company known for shitting up games with microtransactions.
---
Is it my or any other player's fault that instead of reinvesting that money we pay them into EvE, Hilmar wiped his ass with it trying to make dumb fucking bullshit no one wanted? No.
---
Should we grin and bare and think everything is just dandy in hopes of bilking some fucking noob into investing his cash into a shit game, instead of rallying for change and giving our honest opinions? No.
---
Should you go fuck yourself? Yes.
---
&gt; Excellent shitpost.
---
Yours is indeed the most concise.
---
Jesus fuck can you say anything but "YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT"?
---
People are literally explaining to you why it is correct for us to be mad and you're totally ignoring all of them.
---
Kewl story bro. Been on reddit for almost 10 years, im older than most, and don't need you to patronize. You seem really good at it though, you must get a lot of practice. Try not to do that, it's unbecoming.
---
"and then bashing everyone in there and calling everyone guilty of something?"
---
Those links are from today. The sure look guilty to me.
---
And because you clearly didn't read through this post like the expierenced redditor you are, it has nothing to do with gameplay. It has nothing to do with balance, and most importantly it has nothing to do with CCP or the design of the game. Slow you roll interenet Knight.

Jokes on you I already dont log in

Bahaha

What MMO do you think has a better IQ average? WoW?

Just getting past the tutorial and not quitting EVE in the first week probably requires more creative thinking than most MMOs require in their entirety.

Less ratt, more hunt.
---
Your "statement" only said that once upon a time CCP has made a dumbass lie and paid for it.
---
Refutal was published by the current CSM, that being kicked basically means the player is leaving right that moment and never comes back, but of course, you missed it entirely, didn't you?

Hey man, I wasn’t being an asshole to you bud. I was busting being a bitter vet on my Eve. Your eve is enjoyable still. I’m glad you like it, I just wish you coulda have seen it. When you played the game from Close Beta and onward... a lot changes. Don’t be mad at me bc I didn’t like the last 10 years. Hell I lead fleets, fought for sov., died, lived, I helped provide content to a lot of people. Things happen man, enjoy your eve.
---
1. As an adult participating in an online video game, yes you are. As someone who has become a member of the EVE community, yes your are. If you are in fact and adult, and you don't understand your influence on the world, ESPECIALLY video games, then lord help you. You got some catching up to do.
---
2. No, the money you paid EVE was for the game THEY ALREADY DESIGNED, not future developements, you aren't INVESTING in EVE, your buying the product they already produced. EVE online and the ability to continue to use the SERVICE.
---
There i made all the key words caps for ya.
---
And just to reiterate - your not investing in EVE - your buying your time as a service just. like. cable. Get this concept? It will be important in the adult world. You aren't investing in version - your paying for a service. THEY OWE YOU NOTHING, but said service. period.

Be mad at CCP all you want.
---
When you express that anger to the community do it in a way that doesn't push away players, and instead pushes CCP to making changes.
---
I've explained this about a million times. Please reference this comment for a better understanding of the post that you very cleary do not.

For real, looking back every time I took a hiatus from Eve it was because of the gloom and doom that gets spread around here. Last time I quit it was because of all the panic surrounding abyssal modules.
---
The amount of fear mongering in this sub is dizzying. So much so that I've noticed that unplugging from r/eve every now and then has really improved my enjoyment of the game."
---
You don't even have a mediocre one? Not a single idea better than retarded?
---
No I just rorqual mine
---
Serious question: how do you obtain the 64bit client? I'm on Linux and I've been playing using Steam Proton, but I wanna give 64 bit a shot to see if it works.
---
I'm sure anyone who has ever interacted with you has a similar feeling. 
---
The way things get turned into backstabs/conspiracies/plots and completely ignore how they actually went down just three years ago astounds me, it's pretty impressive. Yet at the same time it's also idiotic and braindead, but considering how you've been posting so far, it's not surprising you ate it up.
---
No, I apologize, I did not think you were. My tone my be aggressive because it's been a 1 vs 300 person debate over here and 299 of them didn't understand the damn post and went on a tirade about CCP.
---
Thank you for this - I plan to stay with EVE regardless of the doom and gloom mentality of this subreddit. I don't plan to stay here. I just wanted future newbros to discover something a little more inviting than i did just recently..
---
Whats the program you use to switch between windows?
---
Wish I could give you gold.
---
That made me very, very moist.
---
You say you were rolling the WH.   
---
I see your mega goes 500m/s.  
---
You roll with unhiggs'd BS's?
---
Don’t trust anyone. Best advice you can get for eve.
---
This post took longer than expected.
---
&gt; Either way, you made your bed. Now enjoy lying in it while the other 2/3 of EVE gives you the middle finger. :)
---
Haven't been in PL since October, nobody is giving me a fucking thing at all bud.
---
Confirmed this happened to me as well. Had to download a new eve launcher, which reset all my settings, and fixed the issue. Unfortunately resetting all my settings has my game in a garbage state of quality. Such is life I suppose.
---
Monthly CYNOU bait?

Ugh Finally

shut up russian

You see, there are these folks on the Internet known as trolls...

Hobie?

Thanks man yeh hoping to continue it for the foreseeable future :) keeps pvp fun for me if i change the main ship i fly each week to so is win win.
---
&gt; The Magic of Eve, is you can get rich without Even docking.
---
How does that make it any different than playing the auction house in wow? It's essentially the same thing.
---
If *that's* supposed to be the draw for people to play eve these days, the game is truly dead.
---
Glad to hear it my friend thank you :)
---
Good info cheers :)
---
Probably the best thing to happen to happen to PL in a long time. G'luck DJ!

One of the best trailers for the game and guess what? It's because of the very player base you seem to have no problem with insulting.
---
EVE has a reputation of being harsh and hostile even toxic at times. That is not going to change and I don't think anyone wants it to change. It's what interest people to begin with and one of the games biggest claim to fame. I have no problem with ccp making it easier for new people to get in to the game because when I started I was handed a ibis and told to have fun which resulted in me being concorded for about 30 minutes.
---
What I do have a problem with is someone with little to no understanding of the game or the people who play it coming in a Player run subreddit saying we are all toxic shit lords. So why don't you fuck off until you know what you are even talking about.
---
I have read almost all of the replies you made to people and all of them make you look like some entitled little shit as if their complaints are invalid. Some of these guys have been playing since day one and I think they know way more about the game and the company that runs the game than you do.
---
Is PL, dare I say it, back?
---
No matter what you think of anyone, seeing players quit because of the state of the game a shame. Stifling mechanics that limit peoples ability create content in a sandbox is a surefire way to make sure no one plays your sandbox
---
don't blame the player, blame the game
---
Or just have anomalies point people. It makes no sense that they dont, really.
---
To be fair, his mother *is* a whore. He can't really help it.
---
&gt; You aren't investing in version - your paying for a service. THEY OWE YOU NOTHING, but said service. period.
---
Hey it looks like you understood exactly the point I was trying to make. I don't owe them anything either. They provide a service, I pay for it. I have zero compunction to do anything specific to attract and retain new players. So your base level complaint here is completely dead in the water of your own volition.
---
We don't have to do shit or have any opinion one way or another other than the one we want to have. So fuck you and fuck your post.
---
In DJ we trust.
---
another vet, content creator and paying customer leaves
---
Sure, eve is fine, we still get bot subs.
---
You have to enable the option within the EVE Launcher Settings.

It's usually better to keep them separated because it allows you to train twice as fast and is especially useful as an alpha because of the slow training speed.
---
It's simple, you have been given a sandbox where you can do whatever you want and you chose to find leaders and band up serving someone that for some reason is your "better". You all suck. Every goon, every nanncydock drone, every pl member. You chose to be someone's subject in a game where you could have done anything your ambition allowed. You suck
