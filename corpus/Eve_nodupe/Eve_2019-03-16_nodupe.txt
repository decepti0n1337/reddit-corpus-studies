Thank you, is that the only one right?  If there is already a precedent, maybe its the first of many.

If subcaps able to damage a behemoth like a titan is shit game play, then a behemoth like a titan being able to damage a subcap is also shit gameplay
---
Rapier or loki

---
I am going to troll less than normal because you are starting to see part of the core of the issue.
---
For the most part I agree with your analysis of the effects of the changes.  Where our views part ways if your proposals.  
---
-Anoms: WH space should have been the 'money tree in nomad space' but they were fucked on launch and I have been arguing against their current existing forever.  With a proper 'travel for high end isk' system, anomalies could be rebalnced to 20-60m/h l4 mission level as pre-carrier changes.  
---
-Inhib:  You more or less want the inhib to be a minor 'iwin' button, the irony here is your attacking force is also using the same 'op cyno' functions you complain about.  
---
-Attacker Staging:  Even goons have posted about the need and game-health effect of NPC stations in/near sov regions.  This is a spot on example of a perfect 'good for everyone' change.  
---
-Bosons:  AoE effects in general have 'scaling issues'.  There are two parts to this, the 'relative ease' of a Boson vs say a bomb run, and the overall power of all AoE effects.  There is no simple fix to this.  (Eg; 50km will just lead to SB titans, which will work more or less as well up to the destroyer level).  The real problem with Bosons is on the capital level, with things like Dread bombs and carrier fleets.  
---
Assetsafetey:  Your proposal is technically difficult due to the nature of the information.  Citadel A dies, Corp Z has the thing down, Player 69 waits max duration to asset safety, Corp Z no longer exists, it reformed into Corp Z dotte, who gets the ISK?
---
Definitely. 
---
The desire to stop it isn't horrible, but a five minute timer is pretty stiff. I thought I'd help continue the conversation with you so you don't have to talk with someone who still calls people faggots on the internet lmao

I guess let's wait and see how long it survives for?

If you are looking for some ideas take a look at some Amarr ships - Oracle, Gallente Megathrone/Kronos are also a very good models for this stuff. And you can never go wrong with Sansha's Phantasm/Nightmare &lt;3

Outstanding!

Love the art style, reminds me of Da Vinci's notebooks! 
---
Right, you hate cynos, I get it. I stand by calling you bitchmade. There is already a mechanic that stops 0eopke from moving too far too fast, it's called jump fatigue. If you lack the mental facilities to deal with cynos, perhaps eve isn't the game for you.
---
I started replying to you where you said PVE fit VNI wouldn’t be able to offer a fight vs hunters, in a thread that was focused on talking about capitals being hunted. You’ve replied talking about feeding hunters capitals - irrelevant to the original point.
---
Sure that sounds like a fair trade to me. No more carrier rating, no more killing rorqs, no more super hunting.  Glad you're not in charge of the game, your version sounds like shit. If x can damage and kill y, then y should be able to damage and kill x
---
Titans are a ship mostly used for bridging, ganks an uncontested structure removal.
---
However they are also the entire end game meta when it comes to sov war and you cannot win without having N+1 titans. Super carriers are now just suicide tackle to hold down enemy Titans while your Titans kill them.
---
&gt;The desire to stop it isn't horrible, but a five minute timer is pretty stiff.
---
It must be severe as eve players are good at coming up with ways to circumvent "annoying" mechanics. It is also an easy change for CCP to make.
---
The actual delay could be debated, but the intention should be to get rid of the instant teleporting. Adding "risk" as CCP is attempting is unlikely to work given the massive isk explosion in null. Risk will be managed and not necessarily in a way that produces the desired result. Its almost on the same level as balancing based on price.
---
He had an hour long meltdown in local last night; a thread was inevitable.
---
&gt; -Anoms: WH space should have been the 'money tree in nomad space' but they were fucked on launch and I have been arguing against their current existing forever. With a proper 'travel for high end isk' system, anomalies could be rebalnced to 20-60m/h l4 mission level as pre-carrier changes.
---
I wouldn't mind your kind of an overhaul. My system is still in the boundaries of "farms and fields" rather than "travel for ISK".
---
&gt; -Inhib: You more or less want the inhib to be a minor 'iwin' button, the irony here is your attacking force is also using the same 'op cyno' functions you complain about. The difficulty here is that the 'negative aspect' of the cyno meant to balance its use is working as an advantage against the inhib.
---
I am a paternalistic kind of person. I look at OP patterns in meta and argue for their change. I don't take issue with particular mechanics in themselves, but their relation to overall meta. If a mechanic supports an OP meta, then it's bad. If the same mechanic supports a meta that needs to be supported, then it's good. My proposal wouldn't affect hunters' offensive usage of cynoes.
---
My inhib wouldn't be an I win button. It would be interactive gameplay between people trying to light defensive cynoes and people trying to prevent them. You can still light defensive cynoes elsewhere than the immediate grid, and attempt to bring in a force. Attackers can attempt to protect themselves with defensive bubbles. Defenders can remove those bubbles, and so on. And if bubbles are a good way to prevent titans from warping in, god forbid, the defenders might actually be encouraged to protect space via bridged subcaps instead of titans all the time.
---
&gt; The real problem with Bosons is on the capital level, with things like Dread bombs and carrier fleets.
---
This goes back to the spontaneous vs timer based PvP distinction. Those big dreadbomb and carrier fleets are often tools of timer-based PvE. You guys think those are what matters as this PvP is the most visible. Whereas what actually matters for meta is hundreds of people getting bosoned at gates all the time.
---
And no, smartbombing titans are not as big a problem. You need 5 of them to kill a similar fleet. And the fleet can warp from an angle that avoids the smartbombs. There is currently no way to take a gaet while avoiding a boson. 
---
&gt; Assetsafetey: Your proposal is technically difficult due to the nature of the information. Citadel A dies, Corp Z has the thing down, Player 69 waits max duration to asset safety, Corp Z no longer exists, it reformed into Corp Z dotte, who gets the ISK?
---
My proposal has many more technical difficulties, such as what if defenders deployed their own structure. I worked them all out, but it requires a topic of its own. The difficulty you raise is easy to fix. If someone deletes the corp because they don't want free money, then the money should go to NPCs.
---
Dead fishes always swim with the flow.
---
Zkillboard.com has something that is very useful for finding a Corp: The activity for the last 90 days. Say you always log on at the same time every day. You want your desired hours to closely match your corp's hours. Playing by yourself can be pretty boring. Even if you favor solo activities you will eventually want someone to bounce ideas off of or show off what you have done.
---
Zkill breaks down a Corp kill board history by day of the week and hours of the day.  The image is rather small and far down the page but it gives useful information.
---
Actually "starting fires" like this only pressures developers to make knee-jerk reactions and further hinders development of the game, often requiring overnight patches that not only take development hours but also often introduce new bugs that will take even more hours to fix.
---
Remove subcapital
---
Mach used to have 8 guns, one got taken off a few years ago in a nerf/buff 
---
You can leave Eve... But Eve never leaves you
---
You're much more likely to more of out of the game this, good luck 😀
---
I don't even understand what point you're trying to make. Goons are bad because they use game mechanics to their advantage, other groups are good because they're too incompetent to do so? 
---
Yeah it's dumb that a carrier can point you at 200km.
---
Lol like it will come back...
---
Soon TM
---
Jeeeeesus fuck I'm blind. Thank you
---
The canges were not big enough
---
It's quite a good suggestion to reduce the MWD cycle timer, but in addition to the existing nerfs, not instead of it.
---
I think it's ok for a corp to struggle with structures when the players are not able to log in every few days to make sure everything is fine. But to add a decay mechanic would require even more attention because now repairs will have to be done, more time and resources have to be invested, etc.
---
So corps will struggle with this - and because of that, they will stop investing time and resources into structures.
---
Congratulations, this didn't solve anything. It only made it more tedious for small (beginner) corps to build and maintain structures.
---
Selling tin hates 50% off
---
fake 
---
As I replied below, it's not really about refueling - it's about what would happen when a decay mechanic is implemented. It will add more reasons not to build/maintain a structure.
---
But that doesn't solve structure spam, it just makes it more tedious for small (beginner) corps from exploring that aspect of the game.
---
and gay 
---
The principle is still the same. Or do you set out to hunt and tackle supers without the capability of killing them?
---
Man... It's been years already..?
---
If they just would hire more competent people like you, it would change EVE forever. Maybe apply for a job at CCP? Show them how things should be done? Looks like they could use real experts.
---
That would explain why all the HK inties were swarming like flies earlier
---
As a general rule of thumb, I'd avoid C4s. The increased energy neutralization, higher DPS, and remote repairs make the more difficult, and the more distant spawns make it too long to clear effectively. 
---
With C3 and below though, you could feasibly do them. Use Karr's Modified Rykki's guide for accurate information on the damage and ewar each site does. 
---

Nice!
---
Don't knock it till you try it is what I say
---
Yeah.
---
The guy took a fleet out, then after kind of rubbing leadership the wrong way, brought his fleet back to staging and announced he was now the Alliance exec.  Then the previous exec said that's not how it works, so he bribed his fleet (who kind of wanted to stand down) to go fight the previous exec.
---
Then the friends of the previous exec did the awoxing.  But is it really awoxing if Caesar shot first?
---
Re: Inhib, yea I thought your version shut off the active cyno for some reason.  
---
I would rather it land the incoming capitals in a nice random ball possibly out of fax range of eachother and the cyno ship itself, than buff the tank of the module.  
---
If you buff the tank of the module, it can open up possible exploit vectors.  It also still allows fax to land in-range for as long as the cyno lives, which with fax landing helps ensure it lives.  IT being either the Target or the Inhib, depending on your use vector.
---
I enjoy those lizard pictures.
---
There is no counter to instant teleportation. Thats why people defend it.
---
I am aware, I seem to be the only one that cares tho
---
Aw shit fam. You ain’t wrong but it would ruin my narrative 
---
:( aye, when carriers had Triage, Dreads couldn't track cruisers.. shit, I think it was even before SOMER blink.
---
Tidi is a feature, not a bug
---
But they had hole control for atleast 20 minutes cause they had the (yes im gonna say it) numbers advantage. We rageformed everything we had (timezone problem cause we are eutz) and ended up with \~250 people in stukas and ravens while they had 175(br numbers here dscan had 200) in muninns and cerbs. Now to say the ravens and stukas would have the advantage in that fight is a bit of a stretch issnt it?
---
We ended up winning the second engagement and managed to roll the hole just before their allies in form of a 300man horde fleet could jump in (intel said they were \~5jumps out from the chain).
---
Glad you seem to be open minded enough to know that a br or in this case a single killmail thats 2 days after the real fight doesn't tell the whole story. thx for listening, much love :)
---
&gt;Subacps able to damage a behemoth like a titan is also shit game play
---
&gt; If x can damage and kill y, then y should be able to damage and kill x
---
Grath, I get that some people are insecure and need to be lead by those who are haughty, but you could tame your shit logic for a day and make sense to others
---
Gonna be fun until removed? So you are admitting it is ok to exploit? I know you can't see this as you blocked me long ago for calling you out in the past, but this, this should get you banned from not only here, but Eve as well.
---
&gt; Re: Inhib, yea I thought your version shut off the active cyno for some reason. (i edit my posts with further thoughts too often haha)
---
The "ball" idea would just mean that the umbrella comes in, takes a small fleet warp to the center, and lands. Since they all come from different angle there is nothing to prevent that warp. Meanwhile, if you mean that the "ball" radius is too small to take warps to the center ship, then they are already in doomsday and fighter range. Either case this would be even worse than the current inhib.
---
I don't support a tank buff for the inhib as well. But if you buff its range, the reasons why people argue that its tank should be stronger already get removed. They argue that, because a tackled super/titan can blap the inhib quite fast. But what if you drop a 3000 km range inhib 2500 km from the tackled target?
---
My proposal includes 2 things btw. The inhib range buff, and an active single targeted cyno shutter on blops battleships. The shutter takes 15 seconds to spool up, and sieges blops for 2 minutes. In that 15 seconds, defenders (if they are ready, if this is a bait, and so on) can bring in the umbrella and the blops will be free meal as it is sieged. If not, then the cyno is shut down and the inhib prevents a 3000km radius from lighting a cyno. So now they have to cyno far away, and take a warp to the target, where the bubble interactions can occur.
---
Not really, since you would presumably have a bubble too.  Mino optimal rep range is only 27km for a suicide fit.  You could set the radius from 0-120km or whatever easy enough, which would prevent all warps inward without using some kind of crazy 'warp at range to an opposite fleet member who is xxxx...' which gets insane quick.
---
He's controlling the direction of the conversation by hiding the old 'power projection' phrase underneath 'instant teleportation' and framing it as the same thing. There are counter plays to cynos and he's right in that power projection got hellah shwacked (it's why PL turned into a renter alliance). A good conversation could be made about the seconds it takes for someone to land on grid through one cyno, but I don't think you're gonna get that good conversation with him
---
Oh shit I got a stain guy post in my thread

*fangirls*

CCP could just skill up, code better and suck less too.

So GSF will just end up with a Keep in every single region in the game.
---
Remove LAWN
---
I too see AT ships every day.
---
used to be wh's farming c6/ c5, easy 4-5 bill every day for less than an hours work, people are only salty now because mouth breathers can make 180 ish mill an hour mining some what afk per toon, or 240-350 mill an hour actively super ratting.
---
the game is some what balanced atm with income and mining, prices will balance out, and as mining becomes more worthless or people burn out because the reality of actually mining with 20 toons, as much as possible to cover there costs and make bank for shineys, they stop hardcore mining / ratting unless they are short isk.
---
&lt;3 nothing is what it seems to be on reddit, too many people forget /r/eve is where the truth goes to die in favor of a simple story
---
But the suggestion doesn't have structures decay if you keep them fuelled. So no, it doesn't make it any harder than it is today for people who want to run a structure.
---
If it's a VedHAC with 2 guns they will need to do something to stop it from getting insane dps. At max skills a Vedmak can get 360+ dps without ramp up, add another turret and that's 720+ dps before ramp up, at max ramp you would be looking at almost 2k dps, on a cruiser...
---
He's next to another captain.
---
So my corp uses a t1 cruiser. 2 augors with higs and over size prop is half a BS and 1/10 the cost. Rigs prop ship and warp core stabs all made in house with minerals and salvage but to buy everything is less than 10 mil on a bad day. People also use sigils. same idea medium higs rigs oversize prop. Can put plates in the lows or not. 
---
There IS  counter play though, I'm sorry you lack the skillset
---
His point is that we are somehow responsible for the health of the game, due to being the best at it. 
---
Wtf is voltron?
---
I grok you
---
Are you having trouble reading the written word? I dont think subs guns should do enought to damage big shit, however, since limiting that would be stupid game design, the only viable alternative is that everything can hurt everything. I cringe thinking about how difficult your educational years must have been.
---
meh
---
Your whole mentality is damage control lmao. Have you ever thought about not fucking up your words in the first place?
---
If you weren't in jail you could pay your taxes and I'd have a better elementary school to enroll in
---
Your assumptions are wrong, it takes more than 2 hours to replace a carrier.
---
A fit carrier (t2 poverty fit) will set you back around 1.2 - 1.4 bill with t1 fighters, you'll only get around 40 - 50 mill ish ticks if your on the ball. and don't loose lots of fighters (most people are loosing fighters pretty regularly)
---
This is around 150 an hour before any corp taxes, but brings it around to 8-12 hours actively ratting. to replace.
---
a titan will take much more than the 40 hours you suggest. 
---
Excavator volumes are there to prevent ships other than rorquals from using them.
---
lastly your proposal is a waste of time with csm going away? 
---
You should really stop trying to do game design from reddit CCP doesn't and shouldn't for the most part give a shit whats going on here.
---
If you have an idea you should submit it to the appropriate forum on the eveo forums. (gluck with that)
---

---
What is the counter play?
---
Rare, finding (some) truth and reconcilitation on reddit :P
---
What?
---
How do you counter instant teleport?
---
big if true
---
How about stellaris?
---
Sure!
---
I like your asset safety idea a lot. Would be fun to get this in Highsec too.
---
Mobile cyno inhib is a direct counter, flying kitey bullshit is an indirect counter. I'm sure there are others
---
Allowing CO2 to live in them is a pretty huge motivator. See: the north last year 
---
What’s the issue with moving your belonging to an NPC station or structure that is likely to not decay before you take a break? I understand if you had an emergency or some other kind of real life incident that prevented you from logging on, but meh.
---
Really what needs to happen is a hard-cap on the amount of structures in a given system / constellation. That way there’s a reason to fight over who gets to have what where they want it instead of everyone having their own fucking clubhouse in the sky.  So implement the hard cap but allow current structure spam to exist until the system is cleared to where the cap is. Maybe implement this in hand with a decay mechanic where the structure turns into a loo table and salvageable heap to further speed up the process of getting at or below the structure cap. 
---
just remove local
---
I had this same issue too and it was super frustrating. I ended up uninstalling eve AND making sure the delete my cache and any residual files. Then I fresh installed, went to settings in the launcher and verified the integrity of my cache and other stuff. Once this was all done and stuff n things had downloaded, adding and signing into my accounts worked.
---
Good luck. 
---
imagine the trig command ship though

---
Thanks I’ll give this a try!
---
half way through season 3 i lost interest
---
There are a lot of different ways they could debuff it.
---
- they could make the second turret less effective but decrease power grid need so you can fit two
---
- they could keep the damage the same but having two could make the ramp up shorter
---
- they could make the ramp up longer
---
They could do a lot of things
---
I think it will make no difference to people ratting under a decent response fleet as long as they aren't otherwise shit fit, more risk is a good thing. I also think that it will affect smaller groups far more which is troubling, insofar as PvE shit is ever troubling.
---
Griffin
---
You do understand that my first post is regarding more, why would they announce the same AT ships a second time...
---
Mar5hy is displeased
---
They have several PDFs full of chronicles. 600 pages of lore!!

or its just gonna be incredibly OP lol

A really good read mate. That’s a pretty thorough review of the issues being faced. I hope that this change will be the first of many to happen. 
---
Can you use t2 drones as an alpha?  I know these days you can use ships like the stratios as an alpha but I'm not 100% sure about t2 drones. 
---
i try to web scram it down but it always warps away :(
---
Probably Empire being full of unused, freeport tetherables.
---
Ravens 4 lyfe
---
What is The point in Carrier if Ccp keep make intercepter gang so power full you can take down Carrier we cant Even defend our drones vs small gang attack us.
---
ITs a stupid system now Ccp also nef rorq serusly nef The core from 5 min to 3 min on Carrie just make The ship cost build 3-4 time The cost an let it be as it is i sted of ruin it All The The time we All know its a problem for Ccp There is to much rating an mining ig so set The cost up on The ships.. 
---
Astero.  Don't know why I feel this way.  
---
What? That is how you get nothing done.
---
The only way to get bugs fixed is to publicize them and force ccp's hand.
---
It is this way with pretty much every game dev.

---
Exposing it publicly also lets people who might be on the receiving end be ready to deal with/avoid it. I'll take it.
---
No, thats avoiding the problem. If the cyno goes down, stuff is coming through. No one is complaining about cynos when they cant be used.
---
Whats the delay on the inhib? It better go back in time.
---
&gt;flying kitey bullshit is an indirect counter.
---
Its actually not. Brawling has many issues, but cynos ensure it is even less viable.
---
I read through everything and I agree with some points, but you laying it out like this seems like you are just giving us a list of things that counter your playstyle.
---
Sabre, i hate that ship when he's red/neut/orange
---
The trick is that at carrier 5 and with a full rack of faction ddas on a mid you can ones hot a battleship with 3 guns and a missile.
---
Otherwise I usually put one fighter on each battleship and do 2 missiles per bs.
---
F
---
Notice how you said "if the cyno goes down" (which I'm sure you're talking about the inhib here), that means that while this mechanic(the inhib) is active, instantaneous teleportation is effectively countered. If you want to discuss the effectiveness of this counter, that's a different discussion, but there's no arguing that preventing something from happening isn't a counter to that something happening.
---
Flying kitey bullshit is an indirect counter because while cynoing in a titan on a garmur will most of the end the kitey garmur's games, the garmur is not going to die as a direct result of someone clicking "jump to". Instead, the garmur will just fly away, unharmed. The cyno still happens, but the intended effect of the hot drop does not occur, and that's why I consider it an indirect counter.
---
That is pretty sick :D New wallpaper in fact...
---
I mean, let's be real - if you don't have a sueprcap umbrella they were worthless already. 
---
Excuse me, I couldn't finish reading because i'm lazy, but I got to the vertical farming thing. What is stopping the other null powers from farming with a super umbrella? PanFam has supers, they have pilots, and they have miners. So they are just lazy from my point of view.  
---
Two of you can!
---
"Units available: 2 in this station"
---
CCP has proven in the past that they don't do shit unless the cat gets out of the bag.
---
You judge the few, claiming they are the many. 
---
Rather not.
---
good, bye
---
Username checks out
---
I'm confident that there are 150+ Rorqual multiboxers in this game, multiboxing between 5-15. That's 150 people to you who can afk farm a titan, under extremely safe conditions, in approx 20-66 hours.
---
&gt;  What is stopping the other null powers from farming with a super umbrella? 
---
The bigger umbrella comes and kills their umbrella, stops their farm.
---
When EVE finally happens our descendants will say “This is exactly as our ancestors predicted it would happen!"
---
My main activity is stealing expensive drones in vertically farmed regions. The activity depends on vertical farming. I am arguing against vertical farming.
---
grr goons :)

Fear our new mighty Drake army. I'm bringing 2008 back.
---
Highly recommend Rimworld. Clever design, received plenty of care by the maker (a single dude who punched out all the updates) and a nice punishing setting. 
---
My friend, you and those who take after you have made "AFK Rorqual Mining" a thing of history. If I look away for a few minute. I'll return to my drones in some pontifex's cargohold or destroyed.
---
I'm a goon, and I can say our super umbrella hasn't left delve for many many months, and I know for certain that PanFam still holds a large super fleet capable of defending their space. So again, what is stopping them beside the effort required to provide it?
---
Saw this good world in videos and now want to experience it.
---
How is it damage control, I literally own zero capitals right now, i kill them.
---
Also its a sign of weakness to attack a poster instead of the point of his post, but then, you could barely read the post so i guess i shouldn't expect so much from you.
---
Cyno inhib, they've been in the game for years and they work great.
---
It was James will !
---
Three guns and spool-up bursts?
---
&gt;Notice how you said "if the cyno goes down" (which I'm sure you're talking about the inhib here), that means that while this mechanic(the inhib) is active, instantaneous teleportation is effectively countered. If you want to discuss the effectiveness of this counter, that's a different discussion, but there's no arguing that preventing something from happening isn't a counter to that something happening.
---
Its not a different discussion. Cyno is activated instantly. How long does it take to activate the inhib? Even if it is instant as well, which it must be or its basically useless, is eve supposed to be twitch based game?
---
&gt;Flying kitey bullshit is an indirect counter because while cynoing in a titan on a garmur will most of the end the kitey garmur's games,
---
Because of cynos (and other things), you are penalized for not flying kitey. The fact that you may use kitey as a way to avoid the problem does not make it a counter. The teleportation still imposes a restriction (you have to fly kitey).
---
Whats the activation time?
---
The video additionally featured a Leshak in an abyssal site. Could be for the nice shots or is a hint for upcoming abyssal content.
---
Sorry you're wrong, its not an exploit until the game company declares it as one and until that point its fair usage.
---
Thanks for the information. My Malediction will be there !
---
Do you honestly not know about cyno inhibs?
---
I really hope this is satire
---
The nerf to hotdropping carriers and supers is perhaps the only thing in the dev blog that I think is a big negative- however, I'm not sure how impactful it will be in the long run.
---
At least they'll catch up and be 1-1 on keepstars soon, right guys?
---
A nice EVE meme for my birthday, thank you
---
You gonna answer the question?
---
Blue is just a color. And Tau can betray me all day long with that sexy accent.
---
Dont even bother to read, your time is more valuable
---
The number of people who live in citadels in wormholes without asset safety blows a lot of holes in your theory here.
---
not really ... but just when i see one, i feel it is misplaced there ... a wreckage fits better in that picture :D
---
We'll get there, was my 1st time in a Huginn, had fun, 7/10 would do it again.
---
It is an obvious bug Grath. Abusing an obvious bug is the very definition of exploiting.
---
Good to see where you stand though.
---
Good man best way to be.
---
"they fight likes pussies"
---
Should have insured your carrier, would have been replaced much faster.  Insurance pretty much covered all but the fit.
---

We historically had closer ties to PL due to PHEW leadership coming from there, so from the perspective of "everyones ping ends at Goons or PL", ours tends to get to PL. Waffles also decided to come crash on our couch for the content after leaving PL and rebuilding their identity.
---
But PL have long since not cared what happens to us, if they sometimes show up its only to get content for their members and they don't really care who is being shot.
---
That said we also have good ties with groups that are just generally fun to work with, doesn't have to be panfam.
---
TBH I feel very pressured. Im not sure I can make it through this AND a Keepstar loss.
---
no, you lied and said there was no counter when there was an obvious counter thats in the game.  just because you've decided to put your argument on roller skates and move it around to suit your need doesn't mean I'm required to follow.
---
you lied, I caught you, end of discussion.
---
I stand on what the game developers deem is allowed and not allowed.   They've said nothing about this.
---
Weird flex but sure
---
If it is a counter depends on if it can counter, which in this case depends on the activation time. You dont want to answer. Do I have to look it up myself?
---
Once its up, a cyno can't be lit, thats a counter.  Sorry, you're a liar and pretty bad at it.  Its not instant, and i know thats what you want but that would be dumb as fuck, theres literally no reason to keep talking to you since you're implicitly backing up your lie with more stupidity.
---
Look. People tried to imitate vertical farming in their space and they got bashed for it. Case in point is GOTG. 
---
3 years into free farm and exponential growth, at this point it's not about why nobody else Rorqual multiboxes in their own space. It's about everyone who wants to play that way joining Imperial Legacy.
---
Your question is asking like "why can't someone esle work hard and make a Google. There is something called first penetration advantage. The mechanics were bound to catapult the largest capital umbrella into exponential growth, and it did. There is nobody else that can match it, because everyone who wants that gameplay joins Goons and the game allows it (by making it possible that 40k accounts farm in a single region).
---
Fed Navy Comet from my days as a solo breacher / tristan pilot. They were (are) so oppressive compared to most other novice plex sized ships it was always a personal challenge to try one and hope he was blasters. 
---
Sabres from my days as an exploration astero pilot. It is such a fun fight, you can win but you better hope to shit you can kite properly and his friends aren't too close. I really enjoy those hairs' edge win/loss fights.
---
Pando just needs 50 Ravens #germanandefficient

Not entirely sure how wine is all working on Mac, I have used the EVE Mac launcher before on mine without problems. People playing on Linux say that running it through wine is way better than the Linux launcher... Maybe you have to get homebrew first, try looking it up

---
Got picked up by Amazon, season 4 is coming this year.
---
So the activation time is 1 minute. Thats a not a counter, and it costs a lot more.
---
&gt;Its not instant, and i know thats what you want but that would be dumb as fuck
---
It would not be dumb as fuck, it would be a counter. You might as well teleport 500 titans and claim you countered their cyno because they didnt take the fight. Your logic is absurd.
---
There are a couple of options,easiest would be to just firesale the stuff to the locals,if you want to go it the hard way you would have to undock in a scanning ship and wait till the wh has a hs wh connection,you wont be able to dock once more but you will be able to have all you stuff dropped in crates all around the station. I personally would suggest firesaling but the second option is a real adventure!

Are hyperspacials neccesary for carrier ratting? I have trimarks fitted right now on mine and I don't really want to remove it. Is it ok to rat on a trimark thanatos? If it is can someone give me a decent fit for it?
---
Make an alt to join the corp.  Move alt in, Contract all your stuff, move alt out?  Hopefully the Corp takes in the alt.  
---
Do that 15 more times and you'll be at the ISK value of the super that they killed today
---
You do realize that bad posts like this just make it more fun for them?
---
who does provi even have left to fc
---
Might also be an alpha account. In my Nestor ratting my main has T2 drones, and my alpha alt uses faction ones because can’t train heavy drones V.
---
Wow, are you finally becoming self aware?
---
A dead super in Delve, tell me something new. a) it was all Vertiso/WTB Killmarks work b) i am pretty happy to trigger the Dunning Kruger of Olmeca and Marshy ;) Imagine both after the "nerfs" for gewns.

I just started to pvp. I'm super noob. Is FW dead now?

I'll admire it.
---
You are a cheat then. Good to know. Find a bug and exploit it is long as possible. Way to lead your coalition by example.
---
Lol!!!! xD
---
This game sounds so cool. 
---
The truth of the matter is that skill injectors allow the meta to shift so quickly, the players break the game themselves after every balance pass or change.  
---
  
---
CCP won't be removing them, they are hooked on them more than some of the worst addict players i think...  
---
So, you basically have to accept that the meta will change at warp speed after any changes CCP introduces, and CCP will take ACTUAL years to catch up... Or don't, and fade away like so many others have done or have started to do.
---
Oh my god just stop the QQ already, will ya?
---
You can already get Leshak spawns in abyssal sites, battleship abyss site would be interesting though...
---
I think the NSA change will negatively impact solo/small gang carriers and supers a bit too much, 1 minute is a really long time to be able to leave the grid.
---
From a non-ratting point of view 20 or maybe 30 seconds would be appropriate, its more restrictive than fighting a titan DD and you only get increase lock speed/range instead of the ability to delete a fleet.
---
That said if 2 x sensor boosters are enough maybe the nerf to ratting carriers and supers is worth it.
---
NSA's will be relegated to brawls where the life of your carriers and/or supers are already of low value.

We simply disagree
---
Is it just me or did CCP recently hire some Destiny artists/designers to create the triglavian characters... Either that or they are hinting towards a future project utilising a similar kind of game style.
---
Then we shall fight in tidi
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I agree.
---
So we need to move from scarce capitals meta, to common but less powerful capitals which die often and are counterable.
---
Aweh so cute. He forgot hes not in the game anymore. Such a sad boy. All he knows is player grief and staging bum shit to get attention for his stream and his club of lonely boys.
---
rip my leshak :( too many characters and not enough f1-ing.
---
I'm so sick of hearing about 'capital proliferation'  and the poor poor small gang pvper. Where are you getting these numbers, '40 hours to farm a titan'. You're making 1.5 billion isk an hour on one toon? Please tell me more. People really need to stop trying to think of null sec as their personal hunting ground. If you go attack goons, you are strolling into the home of 60k players, of course you get everything and the kitchen sink thrown at you. You walked into their HOME, they live there. 
---
But wahhhhh capitals!!! I can't kill rorqs!! Sub-caps just get owned!

Maybe just realize you're doing it wrong, and stop taking 5 people into the home of thousands, kicking in the door, and being upset when you got punched in the face. Want some decent small gang content? Show up and third party on stuff in bombers. Figure out who is where, and setup to catch stragglers. Stop thinking of wandering around nullsec killing VNIs as 'PVP', it's not. 
---
I'm game, I loves my Drake. :)
---
You can only train up to 5 mil as an alpha, however there is much more potential SP that can be gained either through a temp sub or daily skill injectors that an alpha can use.
---
Yes, but cynos are rampant and have been for quite some time despite the "counters" being available.
---
Buy a PC you hipster.

Great video, super interesting to see what this leads to!

STAGED. This is so fake it makes the US moon landing look real.
---
You can eject your hanger container form a structure into space through your assets window. This will put everything in you hanger in a can about 200km away from the structure it was in. If you can find a quiet hour you can theoretically evac your assets that way. IF there is someone you still trust still in that corp, you can ask them to move it, but that depends on the circumstances under which you were kicked. You could also hire someone to kill the structure for you and reclame your assets that way, but it would almost certainly not be cost effective, assuming you could even afford to do so.
---
Everytime I stop to read this Reddit makes me feel that all playerbase wants to fly frigates and cruisers till the end of time.

It's frigates on-line boys

The very question is why that many people can fit into a single region to begin with.

&gt; https://zkillboard.com/kill/75661535/
---
Responding to an argument on how safe null is with a few killmails is just idiotic, yet many people like yourself do it.

&gt; kicking in the door, and being upset when you got punched in the face. Figure out who is where, and setup to catch stragglers. 
---
I killed 2 supers in Delve just last 24 hours. About 9 this month. If someone is doing it right, I am. This post is not about me though, although you in your mouthbreathing zealous fashion think it is. The fact that I am able to kill supers in Delve doesn't change that they only lose a mere 3% of their farming income, or any other datapoint I provided you, about how safe nullsec is for the health of this game.

 I see a whopping 8 Drakes for sale in Jita. That poor beautiful ship :(
---
What have the Romans done for us?!
---
I never knew how much I wanted that to happen until I read your comment. That's an awesome idea.
---
I love it when a person argues against their self. You try and make the point that 'the super umbrella is too strong!', while also saying you killed 2 supers within that last 24 hours, and have stolen trillions of isk in drones. Seems pretty risky to me. Slow repawn rates aren't going to make them spread out, it just makes PVE even more tedious and boring. Also my response of those kill mails was not speaking of the risks of nullsec. It was making the point that subs have no issue taking on capitals, provided you put a little thought into it. 
---
While I agree that 1 region in nullsec supporting so many people is stupid, the currently proposed changes will do nothing to resolve it, nor will your proposals. As per the 'income level of delve', you can't look at it on a 'per region' basis. When you look at the MER in a per capita basis, and look at the north vs the south you find that the farming numbers are pretty equal. If you just look at delve the number looks big and scary, until you realize that all the income/mining is being used to support 60k people. So looking at the January MER Delve made 27 tril between ratting and mining. That's 450mil per month per toon, how is that game breaking exactly?
---
&gt;Cyno inhib revamp
---
No.  A change like that would make structures and other objectives completely uncontestable, and give complete safety to supercapital blobs by preventing counter escalation.  
---
Please drop them in Esoteria please drop them in Esoteria

I initially thought I was supposed to find Captain Falcon, so I did, &gt;!he's by the armory next to Captain Murica.!&lt;
---
I was confused today as I was in a prospect cloaked off a gate.
---
An astero jumped in and cloaked, I saw him warp all the way across system. He stayed on my overview even when he jumped out.
---
I warped to the out gate because he was 56.2 AU (STILL ON OVERVIEW) and so was the gate. I couldn't target because he had jumped out, but there was still a square in space and he was still on my overview.
---
*Republic* Stabbers, perhaps?
---
I miss flying the brick. Maybe I should get one. 
---
Got damn that video was good
---
Hyperspacials don't matter as much for normal carriers since you spend a lot less time in warp then a super.
---
You don't take it to have it, you take it to take it away from an idiot.
---
I think my comment was misunderstood when I said that insurance is not a thing for faction/TII. By "generally doesn't apply" I meant that the coverage amount is tiny compared to what you paid for the hull. However you should still go platinum insurance even for such hulls if you expect to die within the next 6 months. Free money is free money, even if not a lot.
---
An example: a pirate faction hull may cost 50mill, insurance is 1mill for a 3mill payout. The 3mill doesn't come anywhere near the price of the hull, but it's 2 million free ISK. Insure your current TI ships that you're dying in all the time.

Well played tonight.  Your guys dictors did excellent work, if our dreads had made it in we might have had a different outcome.  Sadly no plan makes it past first contact.
---
They are terrible now. Passive tank can't even handle belt rats 
---
Wow. Commenters are fucking retarded here. There are half a dozen MMOs in 2019 with over a thousand olayers on a single shard topology (with countless titles lining up after)
---
That's why CCP is looking at Hadeon and Improbable
---
Its n+1 for a reason, any group no matter what ship type they use, if they have more of them and they have some kind of logistical wing, will murder a group of a lessor size in the same ships.
---
battle ship fleets are dead because bombers for the most part, and no on enjoys the warp speed of battle ships if the place to be is 10+ jumps away.
---
next it will be Your only allowed 10 corms each!
---
I can already think of half a dozen ways to get around an increase in fatigue, one is have multiple super toons, 2 is have multiple supers pre staged and just zip between systems in a ceptor via a jb / jc, to the appropriate keep star.
---
more to the point maybe they should remove npc null stations, and have agents in space. 
---
after all according to him "NO ONE" should be safe.
---
Dweeb-King Valkorsia
---
i dont know, warping an orca to a covetor is a bunch of effort.
---
Thanks for that, though if those dreads had landed we still controlled the escalation and we'd have punished them severely. Thought you might try and commit your supers too since we were keeping tabs on your aeon (amoungst others) so we worked on getting ready for those as well.
---

Haha, had to get him back to the keepstar to downship to an archon . . . granted I decided not to pentabox.  Quad boxing 3 dreads and the only faux was bad enough.

---
# Answer:
---
Because a lot of people on this subreddit doesn't understand the complexities of EVE and how the game is played. This puts new players / visitors in a position where reading wordy Microsoft Word-prepped double thesaurus-substituted brain farts (*much like this post*) leads them to think that just because someone sperged out a 1,000 word essay ~~discussing how~~ ~~they can't survive in EVE b/c CCP totally shat on him with excavator volume modifications~~ then they must know what they are talking about. **SPOILER:** They don't.
---
You being obnoxiously loud and aggressively self promoting (*w/ the help of others &amp; their multiple reddit accounts propelling your shit upward*) your feces filled paper bags of word vomit echoes the same cucklordish echoe chamber that formed some \~6 years ago or so.
---
# What happened ~6 years ago?
---
Some people who were really bad at the game kept complaining about "*reeeEEEEE Pandemic Legion and Goons and BOB and everyone can literally show up at every fight with 100s of capitals AND EVE ISNT FUN FOR US SOLO PVPERS! How dare the devs keep me from carrying out completely risk-adverse strategies!!*" They kept getting louder. New players were joining at a steady rate so all they saw was this megaphoned narrative - they inevitably join the ranks. It begins to turn into a mudslide of excrement pushing CCP to do something, pressuring the devs to react b/c "*err merr gerrd our PR image when the game is just picking up steam!*"
---
# The result of CCP reacting without fully understanding the consequences?
---
CCP absolutely, in the most spectacular of failures and dumpster fires, annihilated capital movement with the implimentation of Jump Fatigue Revision 1: The October Halloween Massacre of 2014. After completely whiffing an opportunity of bringing balance, and instead utterly destroying a key component of the aging games overall playerbase strategy, players quit the game in hordes... like literal hordes. [HERE IS AN ILLUSTRATION FOR REFERENCE](https://i.imgur.com/t3cgrpU.png) \- it wasn't instant (*well there WAS a big initial slope at first*) b/c people thought they may realize how terribly game killing their changes were, but CCP stood firm, and people slowly came to the realization CCP won't correct things fast enough / effectively enough (*illustrated by a continuous downward trend*). Close to half of the active playerbase left over the next two years.
---
**TL;DR** \- You share a multitude of similarities with historical GGGC (*GRRRrr Goons GRRrr Capitals*) figures that popped up throughout the lifespan of EVE Online's community. A few of them managed to gain influence and promote their own narratives. A few of these narratives managed to gain enough momentum that forced a CCP reaction, a reaction that utterly destroys the game for a period of time and results in the mass exodus of active players. You are effectively hot-tracking yourself into the role of becoming the next most hated &amp; despised historical figure of EVE next to Gevlon (*assuming you aren't Gevlon, but that's still an on-going debate*). 
---
**On a final note -** people who continuously post their \~ideas\~ and their \~patch note analytical breakdown\~ of what should have been, could have been, and what's bad of new changes are typically people who have absolutely no grasp of game mechanics and lack any notable understanding of the game outside the itty bitty nitch strategy they have become obsessive compulsive over. Olmeca doesn't understand this game, he doesn't know how to do anything but f1 MJDs and right-click squad warps. He is the absolute opposite of someone who you should absorb information from.
---
Am0k is recruiting.
---
I wish they were slow as balls like excavator speed, but with a 1 minute cool down aimable mjd that can teleport them up to 250km or even further maybe. That way you can position them on top of people once every minute but then you can't keep them on top of subcaps that aren't tackled since they can pull away from them. 
---
Thousands, not hundreds. Average concurrently played account per person went up from 1.7 in 2010 to 3.5 at present. There is data on it, unfortunately I did not bookmark it so I can't source, but shouldn't be too hard to find for anyone curious.
---
So when you have for example 24k players online, that translates to roughly 6.5k average multiboxing. Out of that 6.5k many people play only 2 accounts, and on the big end it also counts bots that run 30,50 or up to 100 accounts across regions. It is impossible to get an accurate number since no breakdown data is available. But its still a huge number, and definetly not 100s.

Dude this is a videogame, not the irl space race. The leaders of organizations other than goons are just bad at establishing any real culture or infrastructure to support community driven PVE. This is not penetration advantage, this is evolution - the smart outlasting the dumb.

The one place I do feel FAXes are a little oppressive is C4/C5 fights - I live in a C4 hole with a C5 static, if we roll into an active group who has caps it does make life a fair bit harder since we can’t counter their caps with our own, we dust have to make do with Guards/Nestors and Bhaals + DPS

I'm very recently back in game after a 6 year break, before I used the drake for everything, has it been nerfed? Is it no longer any good? 
---
Well... then.... I’m glad I never overextended my alts.

Then there are more mysterious in-game lore events. [Baclstage Lore Wiki](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Main_Page) has some info on most of them. Sometimes you will just need to google around and hope that someone wrote an article on what happened.

I guess you're an explorer and you've been killed a lot by asteros, now you're on PvP and hate them. If you would've explored in null you would've started to hate sabres too. But maybe here I'm just describing myself
---
Your IQ is only relatively superior
---
well thats wormhole for you  if the "ex"corp does not help with it its gone.
---
I love this ship, I've died so many times in this, we escaped warp disruptor bubbles, we escaped combat probes hunting for me, we escaped VNIs, Tengus, Sabres, Asteros, we've been in so many worms together, we looted a lot of stuff, we traveled so many nullsec regions and escaped gate camps. We've been harassed, we've been chased, we've survived a lot of times and we've died together. I love my heroin

When blowing up a Citadel in Jspace, do the killmails omit anything dropped from player/corp hangars? 
---
Ex: it doesn't show extra stuff dropped out of Rage when it blew up, but I know there was a ton on the field.
---

---
I want to blow up a Citadel and am just curious on what to expect if we actually pull it off in Jspace.
---
&gt; Rorqual multiboxers will still make a lot of money, while single users' yield will reduce. A reduction from 1.5b/hr to 1b/hr for a multiboxer is not that huge a deal as a reduction from 150m/hr to 100m/hr for a solo Rorqual. 
---
I think after a while the ore market prices will go up again since less ore is available and a solo rorqual will again make around 150m/hr.
---
I guess there idea was to make it "harder" to get the resourcess for a super capital within days or even hours.
---
&gt;What you've posted here is an extremely biased opinion that favors big groups like your own.
---
TEST fielded 600 dreads for the UALX fight and that was before they even begun to use the cache. Today that number is possibly even more, and this doesn't consider what Goons could pull off. Fact is that it doesn't matter which direction the pendulum swings in cause it favors them either way. What matters is the viability of the use of supers while giving dreads a healthier role on the battlefield. 
---
Nice! Yes this is exactly what I have experienced, too. Good to know it's not my clients.
---
Now I feel like I am in a counseling session.  LOL. 
---
"Yes, The Astero hurt me there."

It's hot trash. The ferox is the new drake. There is no new hurricane atm, but maybe harbingers might become the new cane post-patch.

---
I'm not a FC, nor master capital strategist, but whenever I see similar battles, I'm always left wondering why.
---
One FAX lost, so presumably there was only one on the field, or the other 20 or more must have gotten away.  Because if you log-in a carrier, you are gonna log-in your FAX alt(s) too.  Right?
---
Maybe just me.
---
Sub-capital fleets have been cancelled for better logi turn-out.
---
Well for exploring, don’t jump in an Astero too soon if you’re still a new player. Go for an Imicus or something cheap until you get the hang of relic/data sites and how to avoid getting ganked, using d-scan and staying safe. Because at 50-60mill a pop you’ll lose an Astero before you’ve made nearly enough money to replace it. And it’ll feel like an uphill struggle. Once you rinse repeat a few times you’ll get disheartened.
---
I’d advise getting that explo loot, sell it off and make a few hundred million before you jump in an Astero. Also make sure you have cloaking. 
---
There’s no right or wrong, but I started in an Astero a bit sooner than I should have and got dropped on a few times and it was exesparating to lose 60mill plus potential 20mill in cargo. When an Imicus would only have been 500k loss and more easily replaceable.

Player hangars don't show up and I'm not sure about corp hangars. I think they work the same way as player hangars 
---
Let me tell you that FCON did not die because of farming from bigger groups (what a strange idea, as they were part of one of the biggest powerblocs at that time), but 95% internal problems and the inability of their leader(s).

So do many other "beacons of pvp" as you call it.

Let's wait and see if they have titans first, if not we can just club them back into their space
---
I think it might be an issue with your connection, as sometimes when you jump system and server/connection is kind of slow, you can see on overview red structures for like second or so.
---
This sounds to me very similar behaviour, which unfortunately I can't reproduce on any of my accounts neither any of my friends yet.
---
anyway, interesting bug
---
I don’t believe it really matters. If someone does the cloaky MWD trick, you can decloak them if you simply go in their direction. It would only help to see the exact position.
---
Have you tried combat probing people when using this? I could imagine that it might work if you can see him on the overview, etc.
---

---
You probably just haven't put enough caps on field yet.

Overconfidence is the way to give your soul to the devil one inch at a time....

---
Because at the other end lies a bot.
---
Bigger drones so no stashing all of them in the wetu ^^
---
The Ferox came first :( 
---
I have to admit that I have not tried that yet. I just assumed that it wouldn't be possible do to the ship being unlockable etc. but there might actually bena chance that even combat probing could work. Going to run some tests later.
---
Nightmare was 4 missile 4 turret slots as well, good times :D
---
Lol drifters 
---
NSA changes have killed carrier/super ratting especially with the spawn rate changes.  No way will I activate a NSA.
---
What's wrong is the roles for all these cap ships.  We make them Into pvp only ships and that's not what they should be.
---
We must get to understand what the real role of a Titan or Super or Carrier or Dread is and then set it up to be that only.  At rhe moment they are just big pvp ships.  That's wrong.
---
I do thing the concept of being able to fit any mod on any ship kinda kills the roles and we end up nerfing  ships that actually shouldn't do  what it's doing anyway.
---
We have rorqual and yes it should mine shitloads and it costs shitloads but the introduction of panic  mod made them a bit over powered.  I'm sorry but if your mining in these ships then you should have support fleet not a mod  that's makes you invincible.  So you shouldn't nerf  the amount it mines.  We dont have panic mods on Supers do we so we have it on a rorq.
---
Changes that CCP make are so kneejerk  and reactions to useless CSM members.  And what they do is stick plasters over everything rather than thinking about the ship properly.
---
You don't need to tell me that lol - I fully expect snuff to turn around and get some dank provi frags at the first decent opportunity.
---
I mean, they are the reason all the nullblocks got their income nerfed, that alone demands payback
---
It's a fairly simple fight. Side A has strong USTZ with good cap numbers. Side B has an okay USTZ with not too many caps.
---
   
---
Side B drops caps in USTZ against Side A. Side A wipes the floor with Side B because they dont have the numbers or support to win the engagement (An engagement they shouldn't have tried to pick imo). Though I weren't there so I can only interpret what happened from the BR

---
yes, it can be nice for brawly small fleets. you can get it to 100k ehp solo and about 600 dps, or to 80k ehp, similar dps and 2.1km/s heated; in a small gang, you get more bursts to cover more stuff :P
---
Do you people honestly not realize that the grass isn't greener on the other side?
---
Capitals are the smallest part of why the game is, has been and always will be circling the ceramic shithole until the check to the colo provider finally bounces, and being able to farm a few more idiots in caps solves basically nothing.
---
The problem is that none of the alternatives are fun or present anything vaguely resembling an interesting contest and PVP in this game is pretty much fucked.
---
Okay, so you whine and whine and whine and CCP nerfs capitals, supers, fax, jump bridges, all those obstacles standing between your main's zkill and the elite pvp ISK efficiency you've always known deep down you should have.  Now you're rolling with 80 LR torp bombers chain dropping at range to avoid the titan counter like hungry birds holding their beak open for a worm to fall in.  If the cyno goes up and anyone jumps you cloak and warp off grid.  The spy reports the faxes are all tired of fatiguing themselves, you find your boy, he dies in 45 seconds with literally no counterplay.  Everyone else whose lobotomy left them with enough fragments of brain to form basic thoughts docks on hearing the support fleet's fatigued up so you bridge or WH back to whatever zero-exposed-counterplay hovel you dropship your bombers to.  Boy that was fun!
---
But some idiot, your bridger, starts whining about fuel costs and all the logistics he's running for everyone to jack themselves off over a meaningless carrier kill.  You're like, well, fuck it.   We can just zip around waiting to get fed in anything.  Let's try interceptors, those are pretty much impossible to catch and we don't need fuel!  So you run around ~ starbursting ~ and waiting for the next worm to drop.  It does, it takes a little longer for him to die because your DPS sucks now but there's like 80 of you still and everyone's on fatigue so it's pretty much like progressquest except... well, no, it's exactly that.  He dies.  Shit yeah we're relevant now right bois.
---
But this is getting kind of like a grind, and you're elite now.  You don't need the crutch of bubble immunity, I mean after several cumulative minutes of orbiting and MWDing on the last few kills you've really gotten the hang of pushing the MWD button.  You're like, fuck it, let's try something new with a little punch.  LR nanos!  That'll work, right?  We can just kite off and blap fighters until they start dropping titans or something, then run away, avoid pipes and dead ends and zip around until everyone's on fatigue again.  It's cool, no risk for us, worst case we roll safes and logoffski.  You find another charitable soul, you press F1, you MWD a bit, they sit there like a helpless retard because there is again literally nothing they can do except stop wasting their life on this retarded game in the first place.  You kill them.  Fuck yeah... I guess?  This is starting to lose it's thrill, though.
---
After a few more weeks of collecting free carrier kills off idiots you realize this is pretty much the dumbest shit you've ever wasted your life on and there's some pretty strong competition I'm sure.  So you're going to try something new!  Wormholes!  That's different.  You start scanning chains and you're like hey boys it's a carrier!  Grab a couple recon points and let's hang out at range and see if it has support.  It doesn't.  I don't even know what the fuck wh shitters fly these days since the T3 nerf, and it's irrelevant anyway.  He sits there and watches himself die as you watch yourself kill him.  You don't even care or bother to loot it, it's just mechanical now.
---
It dawns on you that the only thing that's changed is that instead of them killing you with no counterplay, you're killing them with no counterplay, and then you notice, hey isn't that exactly where the deck chairs were a while ago
---
You wonder what else there is to do
---
:thinking:
---
Nothing
---
Because there are no conditions favoring engagement on vaguely equal terms, and there is nothing you can force to engage on unequal terms where you won't shortly realize it's not them trapped there with you as the cyno goes up because pretty much the only kind of PVP that exists in the game is waiting to get fed or waiting in an anomaly enduring the endless stream of coward shit showing up to shake their cup long enough to get a super or titan and at least then they'll have to nut up or shut up
---
It's not the stuff at the top or the bottom that's broken, and it has nothing to do with range or application or how it's just not fair that CCP isn't continuously stuffing free kills directly into your asshole like the piston stroke of a fucking machine regardless of how inept you are.
---
The problem is there's no reason to occupy the middle and that engagement is not a commitment for anything below the capital class, ever.  So you turtle up in something that won't feed to coward shit if you know you can win and you fly coward shit waiting to get fed if you know you can't.  There's no point in matching comp or even stopping your overship at one class.  They're going to see the d-scan and be like "oh they have an extra logi frigate and a couple drakes on the side, I didn't do that well in math but I know pretty much any advantage at all leads to an exponential difference in outcomes, let's high-tail it boys!"  And it's not like you can chase because it is a near-universal truth that any comp fast enough to gain on a fleet with a head start is too weak to fight it, and even if you catch them dead to rights on a gate the only way to kill more than 5 fucking dudes before they burn back and run the other way with a 60 second head start or align-MWD and disappear in a flicker of overview glitches is a fleet of hics and Vendettas, a gate BFG, or 50 fucking smartbombing titans.  Moreover, the exponential difference in outcomes has nothing to do with fax, logi or any of the other deck chairs you idiots keep re-arranging -- it evolves from literally stationary points with HP pools and DPS that interact in no other way.
---
The game isn't fun because the only people who haven't figured it out at some level are the paid employees of CCP.  But what they have figured out is to keep the pendulum swinging and I guess that's something.
---
They've just opened the alien gates in the slow zone. It's a pretty cool show but they've messed some things up so I can't love it as much as the books. In the show the crew of the Roci are just a bunch of assholes who hate each other, who only seem to stick together for plot reasons. They've completely messed up the dynamic/relationships they have in the book which make it so great.

As an old school gamer, I can say YES YES and HELL YES.

I’ve played on and off for over a decade. No other game, and good god, I have tried so many, engenders so much loyalty from me. The PVP in Eve still makes my hands shake. What you do matters. The meta gaming is legendary. The game world is beautiful and dynamic. It’s like nothing else.
---
Give it a shot.
---
Yes, this can happen to some people. I hope it doesn't trouble you too much.
---
Thanks Pando but nobody cares at this point

This bug is years old and you don't actually see them you just see their last position and where they were flying.

I'm more worried you didn't misspell heron.

This. If you got kicked for inactivity or something equally benign just talk to your former corp. You could also try putting your stuff up on contract.

It's a weird phenomenon. I still stared at the damn thing until my legs went numb on the toilet.

Nope not for me. I can move around slowboating and warp around in system and follow all the movements of the cloaked ship. When I go for a decloak the ship is in the correct position and actually gets decloaked.

You are saying this like the decay mechanic is already all figured out and that there is only one way to implement it. 
---
I'd kill to get a poster set like this on parchment/ blueprint paper for my living room. I don't play eve anymore, but I spent more time in my Heron and Manticore wormholeing than i care to count. I know it's a stretch, but any chance we might see a series of these? 
---
Agreed
---
The 20m SP cap folk refer to is (approximately) the SP required for all Alpha-accessible skills, but it's not an actual cap.
---
Example1: character starts as Alpha and never subscribes. It trains up to 5m SP as normal, and can then learn no more via training. However, using Daily Alpha Injectors, it can then gain all the other non-Omega-locked skills, which would bring it out at about 20m when it runs out of skills to put any further injected skills into. At that point the only way to gain more skills would be to subscribe, since all skills remaining are Omega only.
---
Example2: character starts as Omega and trains purely Omega-locked skills (eg PI, Triglavian ships) up to 5m SP then decides not to renew and stay Alpha. They cannot train anything as Alpha as they are over 5m SP, despite having no usable skills, but can still use Daily Alpha Injectors to slowly get all the Alpha-accessible skills. In the end, this character will also hit the point where no new points can be gained without subscribing, but this character will have ~25m SP rather than the ~20m like the first example character because of the 'inactive' 5m in Omega skills.
---
Sounds like maybe a different bug then!
---
could you say arc pulled a noscope?
---
*perfect*
---
Hyper spatials as are definitely not needed. 
---
Armour fits are not ideal though as you lose a lot of damage by losing your low slots to tank mods instead and the drone navs and tracking you gain from the mids don’t really make up for it. 
---
I’m assuming it’s a PvP Thanatos you’ve got already and want the dual use. Ideally you’d have 2 in that case anyway even if it was shield fit. You don’t want to be jumping to staging and start with jump fatigue when an op is potentially starting and then jumping back to ratting systems. You also certainly don’t want to rat in staging as nobody can then jump to save you if you get caught. 
---
I’d save up for a second and shield fit or if you are very confident in your ability not to get caught then you can hyperspatial it. 
---
A hard cap is a terrible idea, it just means that the owners of space will feel obliged to drop structures everywhere to reach the cap, and that means defenders will have structures and attackers can't place a beachhead structure.
---
A soft cap, e.g. escalating fuel costs, or an escalating fee to be paid to CONCORD/Upwell (ISK sink), based on the number of structures in system, would provide downward pressure on structure numbers, but still leave invaders with some kind of play.
---
I had fun fighting 44th recon.... Pesky condors... I also had fun warping plex to plex trying to land double scram on ventures. Was worth it to kill one. They need to fix it so warp core stabs don't work in plexes. 
---
If you got kicked for a good enough reason that your corp won't help you evac then you should consider the stuff lost, apart from one ship and everything you can pack into it.
---
You're a real artist. Masking a bunch of singular points behind a huge wall of repeating, self-jerking and milked out text. Not saying you're doing it on purpose but conciseness is what I need when reading rants and opinions on reddit
---
Yeah you make a very good point. I hadn't thought of it from a siege perspective.
---
The soft cap sounds a lot like the industry index. The more players doing thingy-ma-jigs in an area and the indexes go up and things are more expensive (if I understand that correctly). If you want cheaper services or fuel costs it would motivate owners to be aggressive in trying to keep the system clear of everything but what they want / need.
---
I like it. Since it seems to be similar to how the industry indexes work, what's the general consensus on that from indy dudes? Is it cumbersome or a hassle? I feel like we have a good general starting point for excellent conflict around structures, but it's like CCP needs to tweak a few small things to make citadels worth the effort of destroying other than for strategic reasons.
---
the second you put a super on field, don't say you weren't warned

Depends on if that Atron is in Catch or Impass.

Can agree, I've seen similar in my field (aerospace).

Not quite, as I stated in my post, I've lived through this more than once and experienced it first hand from inside acquired companies.
---
INIT are saltier over this eviction than anyone in HK and they were the victors......
---
I'm betting you can think of more company names in aerospace that are no longer around.
---
 The fighter nerf is too little also bots in supers already use sebos not nsa so the nsa change won't stop bot supers.
---
My company was just sold off by Google and none of this is happening. We're all actually pretty excited because we've been given more resources to make things happen.
---
Christ I could hear your siege module of a brain chewing stront to type out this garbage. 
---
Its not me who needs the warning :) i know whats likely to happen but higher ups dont seem to care about/realise the danger :(
---
 It makes me happy to see the game keeps going downhill 
---
This isn't a surprise to anyone who knows anything about anything.
---
No one can reasonably see that Eve is doing well right now, the botting issue is the worst it's ever been, the PCU is at 2007 levels, and this is even after the massive encouragements to log in as many accounts as possible via f2p and injectors.
---
The game is probably at it's lowest actual number of humans playing since 2005, since there are so many more multiboxers, bots, and such.
---
I just hope they realize that making actual good game design decisions versus skill injector type cash grabs will result in more long term cash income
---
So you're saying I should now go to Amarr? This is a good point.
---
In the end only @Falcon will be left at ccp, being the less talented and all that.
---
Thank god we have someone to finally tell me the "real" "truth" 
---
I should mention, the first year of the first time I was acquired, like the Tournament, our Christmas party was cancelled. The annual financial results were going to be booked at the end of Dec...sooo. Also, company travel was prohibited from mid-Nov to the end of the year. This is analogous to finding change in the couch cushions, but just shows you how seriously these numbers are taken. 
---
This gives some truth to the saying "The beatings will continue until morale improves".
---
 If you look at the side placed guns for that particular ship the extra turret emplacement looks very ugly as the ship model wasn't made to have more that 1 turret mount on the sides.
---
 This would also look very ugly for us as players having your weapon mounts half sticking out into mid air so my best bet it's a npc.

Mods nuke from orbit.
---
Well, there are a lot of smart people in the Eve community. So, it's hard to write to the whole audience. I think you make great points and I think the design choices you site are the precursor attempts to fix what the ultimate capitulation of selling the company reveals.
---
Well shit to be you.     
---
Still assuming that you are willing to show your private accounts to CCP ... and they don't care is bit bad. 
---
[Ooh, you're hard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqZY2zatqDg)
---
Lesson for everybody:  Don't associate with RMTers.  They are trash and their stench will rub off on you.  
---
yes. buy all those medium expensive drakes first to ensure profit.
---
^^^(.... someones profit. not necessarily yours.)
---
Dirty awoxer.
---
Hey you're still a massive racist based on your twitter, right?
---
I mean... He already did so...
---
So what was the nerf that killed the Drake? I wasn’t ingame when that went down.
---
Do you believe your company is in the same situation as CCP ?
---
Sounds like you got banned for RMT and are now playing the sympathy card.
---
The AT has been dying for a few years.  It was limping along well before PA acquired CCP.    Acquisition or not, it wasn't going to happen. 
---
Pk have u not taken your pills today? 
---
&gt; you can see on overview red structures for like second or so.
---
confirming I have seen this. pretty sure I have been able to warp to these enemy structures accidentally too. without realising I shouldn't have been able to.
---
AUTZ so perhaps my latency from the UK servers has something to do with it?
---
\&gt; After a while we decided to unofficially partner up, and lend each other ISK to take loans if we were a bit short.
---
So it sounds like you were working with RMT just not making any money. You just admitted to being a partner, official or not.
---
Maybe they sub because the person puts on a good show and it has nothing to do with the games at all?
---
I was unaware he was an RMTer until it was known to me, at which point I returned his ISK and severed ties. 
---
This is what I'm hoping for. Rorquals should be a fantastic mining boost ship, not a miner itself.
---
I didn't know he was an RMTer until the day he was purged from GSF, at which point I cut ties. 
---
That's interesting. So, not on "hiatus"?
---
Its a real shame CCP hasnt made modules that increase cap performance. Maybe one day.
---
HML nano Drakes are still A++ small gang ships. 
---
Its a real shame public education hasn't made classes for reading comprehension. Maybe one day.
---
how uu transfer then assets between accounts without leaving traces in api key?
---
Right now nobody wants to set it up and run it.  It is a pain in the arse and really is more of a passion project rather than something that CCP supports.  So yea, i'd say it is dead in its current form. Maybe someone there revives it or maybe CCP puts out new tools to support is in, for example, abyssal space.  But who knows.  
---
found the dickbutt
---
DO YOU HAVE A FLAAAAAAAG?
---
I'm not saying you should be unbanned or remain banned, I don't have the information.  Just saying, if you see or suspect RMT, run the fuck away as fast as possible cause CCP does not mess around with people screwing with their income. 
---
Not cool
---
the frakking GARMUR
---
To each their own. Different strokes for different folks. 
---
Didn’t you read where he was part of goons?
---
and you are 1 of them and your friend Mar5hy, so there for you are part of the problem
---
problem with a temporary POS shield, it lets those inside warp away unless theres alot of bubbles.
---
Ccp can just give you the finger as they have every right to close all of the accounts you had with them.
---
If they don't want to hear your appeal they don't have to. 
---
You will have to accept this and move on. 
---
I don't think lobbying on this forum will work out in your favor.
---
I know. I'm saying I didn't know or suspect he was an RMTer until the day when he was purged. I've reported my fair share of isk-selling spam bots in Jita and other places. I believe RMT is a serious thing that should be stamped out whenever possible. 
---
No
---
45b / 300m/h = 150 hours of farming
---
60b / 300m/h = 200 hours of farming
---
60b / 450m/h = 133 hours of farming
---
AoE fleet repairs to mining ships only then?
---
This is great! Astero and Pacifier, please? 🤪 I love the “messy” style.
---
would either be to weak to care, as stealth bombers vs mining ships is alot of dps, vs large low armored barges.
---
or would be overpowered and we'd have a fax 2.0 situation. 
---
so no.  the current panic is fine.  keep in mind hte idea is to not promote bot behavior, but instead encourage there to be a player behind every ship.
---
wtb tl;dr
---
But tbh, I don't understand why people are crying so much, AT will be back in 2020, is it that hard to wait 1 year to have the 1% of the 1% doing some dank pvp ? 
---
They nerfed heavy missiles into the ground, they're hot garbage now. I've seen people say they use HAM Drakes for pve but I don't believe them. 
---
Globby, if CCP comes with an joboffer towards you, will you take it?
---
AWESOME !!!
---
There are always vastly more failures than successes, no matter what industry.
---
T2 have half the hp of faction, not just *slightly less*
---
Wow quality comment , my mum died when I was 1 
---
Included on the killmail are fittings, fuel, ammo, and industry jobs that have not been delivered. Player and Corp hangar items are not included since they are moved to containers in space (asset safety in k-space) and are not subject to loot fairy rules.
---
rip hek
---
lol hek has died a long time ago
---
does it mean she's the devil?
---
just a man paying his respects 
---
^f
---
I am willing to give CCP access to all my bank accounts and Paypal to prove my innocence. I'm willing to fly to Iceland and swear in front of a judge that I am not an RMTer (or a US judge if they prefer) while hooked up to a lie detector. Dunno what more to do. 
---
What's your opinion on input broadcasting since I saw you post the same thing in chat on 6 NM alts at the same time in an incursion fleet?
---
ISK loaning hurts CCP's RMT PLEX. 
---
Hyperspatial carriers are used by people who have no home defense force to save them they get tackled. They do everything to maximize their ticks due to short life expectancy of the ship. If you have a home defense force you fit tank rigs to improve your EHP to survive until they arrive.
---
IDGI
---
CCP see's an account taking hundreds of billions from a known RMT'er and has been distributing ISK to multiple 3rd parties. You defense arguments are the same any player could make even if they were 100 percent guilty as nothing can be 100 percent proven outside of the game. If they don't make a stand on a case like this, literally no-one would ever be banned for RMT.
---
I believe he’s trying to say he enjoys going extra jumps and overpaying. 
---
Can't we as players make an offer to acquire CCP? Then the CSM would actually be a shareholders meeting. We appoint a product owner, CCP completes sprints with user stories and delivers to the CSM?
---
Experienced that in a wormhole two days ago. Guy with an astero jumped in, I was 75km cloaked away. Then he flew to an other wormhole and never disappeared from my overview. 
---
great rule
---
yeah this posts full of shit because the AT cancellation/major format was happening (and discussed with several team captains) long before the PA acquisition was a thing 
---
Genius.
---
What you coulda done was not engage in RMT.
---
well you cant buy supers in HS, so they dont show up 
---
but... why
---
I've always been of the opinion that CCP banned input broadcasting because people were more happy to whine and complain about something than come up with a counter. Every multiboxing bomber who I spoke to said that it's very easy to counter a bombing wing, but that people couldn't be arsed to.  
---
As for the chat, I have talked to a GM before and they said that they believe that chat logs while broadcasting doesn't constitute a form of gameplay and thus is allowed. That was a while back tho, so if things have changed, I may be mistaken. 
---
I'm sure you have overwhelming experience in M&amp;As, which is clearly highlighted in your well thought out post.
---
This is with a damage bonus - you’re looking at more like 550 of the 2 are not bonused to damage, which is a more likely prospect imo.
---
i prefer flying my drake 
---
Hiya is quite far from the places I usually be in, and my 4GB memory can't quite handle the gazillion mobile depots and undocked ships near stations. Also war deccers...
---
I didn't. 
---
Stop your propaganda, Hek is still fine. I know, I live here.
---
But is that evrn worth anything as proof anno 2019? He may as well received cryptocurrency. 
---
Absolutely, when aircraft programs cost as much as they do and take as long as they do from drawing board to EIS, there's not much wiggle room for recovery if the program gets mismanaged or the market changes. That's one of the risks of the industry, and almost sunk Bombardier a few years ago (3 concurrent aircraft development programs, all of them clean-sheet designs).
---
That being said, there's also the order backlog to consider - a company can run out of cash due to new programs, legal actions from competitors, or expansions, but still have unfulfilled orders worth billions on the books which makes them pretty attractive prospect for an investor with enough liquidity to ride out the rough patch.
---
This reply eliminated all sympathy I felt after reading your post
---
There's usually 1 module in my fit that is usually not available in Hek. When I go to a trade hub I want to be able to use multi buy and get everything I need.
---
Oh wow, PA bought CCP to make money, who would have thought? Now what? CCP was previously owned by a investment firm and a pharma company, they had of course had only pure intents /s. At least now CCP is in the hands of someone who understands how games are developed.
---
It's less jumps actually.
---
That sounds reasonable. Thanks for your input.
---
Input broadcasting your chat heavily implies you forgot to toggle it off when switching to chat from gameplay. Hence why everyone considers it a strong example of using it in gameplay.
---

Turn off brackets before you jump in, turn off tactical overview, boom, no memory used 
---
These are fair, if sarcastic, points.
---
I've seen the gnosis used in low class wh before. Also, the SoCT ships seem to be perfectly optimized for rolling wormholes. 
---
explain how an inhib which is killed by sneezing on it with anything would make grids uncontestable.  The inhib needs a clear buff in some way. Right now its 50mil for a module that can be countered by 
---
1. lighting your cyno within 1 min like a non-moron 
---
2. killing it with your rorqual/super/titan as it has no resists to speak of 
---
3. lighting a cyno 100km away with a ceptor buddy. 
---
They are useable modules after the m3 reduction and 1min anchor time but they are in no way in a good balanced state. 
---
Traders: there is a business to take here.
---
Not allowing someone to defend his name is bad. 
---
Hardly. It’s likely some t1/2 junk that wouldn’t be worth the effort. However, feel free to post examples and if there is any profit to be made, I’ll start stocking the items. 
---
It’s FEWER jumps. 
---
People played for a long time. People tend to naturally acquire the "best" things when playing for a long time, hence getting cap alts.
---
Newer players (not completely newbies though) are often being told they should start training cap alts. Mostly for income methods, really. But this also ends up with them getting into caps a year or two later.
---
But as time goes on, it's only natural that people get into caps (and eventually supers).
---
So basically, time went on. And with time comes more SP, isk and caps. Yes, injectors have accelerated this slightly, but most people that are just getting into caps are not the ones buying injectors. It's mostly vets, so I don't think injectors was a huge influence.
---
^ok
---
I mean if it's in crypto it's probably worthless at this point so hey
---
Brace yourself. You’ll get answers, but I’m not sure you’ll be happy you asked.

In what world is that an issue when empire is already full of freeport stations?

---
Who buys ships in highsec? Support your local builders!
---
Hek vs Rens  
---
Begin!
---
I lost 2 AT ships this way. CCPLS reimburse :(
---
Nolak, there's no point talking to cactusjack. I hope you know this
---
So you got about 2/3 an excavator? 
---
If one of my fleets doesn't get 5 excavs within an hour its a major disappointment. 
---
People will say rorqs but in reality mineral prices were already pretty low (don't get me wrong they did help).  Engineering Complexes made it a lot easier/faster to build capitals, especially supers.
---
I buy from highsec only when I'm there and don't want to go all the way to Catch
---
I can't disagree with this informed opinion. By the way, do you have any insight into the Airbus situation? Has the A380 hammered them, or are they in good shape? If they struggle, will the EU nations just bail them out or, how does that work?
---
I wish I could cloak your posting
---
set graphics to potato mode
---
Injectors. 
---
Hek is the underdog, Rens is a wanna be.
---
I am actually cautiously hopeful PA can make some positive change to the game. 
---
CCP was always too worried about its next big thing investing time and resources into stupid projects. CCP also acted like they could do everything themselves instead of looking to outside expertise. PA might have a more business oriented mindset. 
---
I was looking to apply, but I was looking for a balance team position... then it git canned
---
My friend, I warned you at the top not to read it if you wanted to stay in your happy-place. 
---
Also the AT was probably put on ice because barely anyone gave a fuck about it anymore.
---
Lol afk for too long
---
Thank you.
---
Was thinking of lowsec. There are quite a few lowsec systems with no stations at all. You can camp a dude into a station but you can't camp him into a structure. And stations are seldom found on gate grids.
---
Meant anyone in provi, but yes, would expect nothing less.
---
There was a buff a few years ago, where carriers, supers and titans were turned into the apex PVE (and PVP) ships. Around about the same time injectors, rorquals and mass production citadels were introduced, allowing people to buy SP and train quicker and rorquals to produce capitals quicker and cheaper.
---
As a result krab focused people would start in a VNI/Rattle then throw the ISK they make into injectors towards their carrier. Big alliances, especially those who had recently been pushed over by capital blobbing, pushed members to do this since they were super strong PVP ships too.
---
Before you had to wait ~1 year to turn a VNI into a Chimera ratter, and they were pretty ass in PVP outside of the mega remote rep blobs.
---
Awesome, I am surprised that they cancelled the alliance tournament in that case, instead of feeding it more resources and promotion.
---
I can't help feeling that your chosen flair rather undermines your case.
---
I think this is a reasonable thing to believe is in the realm of possibility. PA may be just what the doctor ordered in the long run. Time will tell.
---
The problem is with the small RAM not the GPU.
---
There is a guy above who believes the AT is gone for good. He seems better informed than most. But, I hope it works out the way you want.
---
Nice work Meiqur, I hope Snuff fucks off and you don't lose the keepstar.
---
Except for that I turned it on to chat. Input broadcasting is allowed in regards to window management, logging in, overviews, and a few other things. If you read the blog, you'd know. 
---
Quick! Someone start a gofundme page. I suppose this could happen.
---
The bottom line is, with a surge of support from the player-base, anything can happen. 
---
Maybe Goonswarm should launch this with support from INN. 
---
It's an idea SO CRAZY IT JUST MIGHT WORK!!!
---
&gt;TL;DR: I was banned by CCP Peligro because I was an ISK lender who had ties to Azathio. CCP refuses to communicate, closes my tickets, and ignores any attempt to clear my name even after offering direct access to all my banking and Paypal accounts.
---
welcome to CCP Peligro, the shadiest motherfucker there
---
&gt;Input broadcasting your chat heavily implies you forgot to toggle it off when switching to chat from gameplay.
---
which is okay, because it's allowed to be used for some forms of gameplay.
---
assumption of guilt is immoral 
---
Amarr is actually pretty competitive with Jita, I find
---
If you do all the above it reduces regular RAM usage too. 
---
it's because PA is really not involved in the management of EVE yet, beyond having it on their books. and this plan was already in motion long ago. the AT is planned to return, but with major format changes—AT ship prizes are probably done forever though, if the plans outlined last year and the year before come to fruition.
---
it is for some stuff, not for most faction and headspace modules though
---
We could have given a dire prediction before the game launched and it would have been reasonable. Yet here we are, not dead yet and one of the the greatest and longest-lasting MMOs. 
---
Let the station spinners herald the falling of the sky, I've got shit to do.
---
So like, by "truth" did you actually just mean "this is my opinion"?
---
Mashed potato mode.
---
There are many ways to play Eve. Pvp is just one aspect with many different layers.
---
Yes, battles can be over quickly. But as many things, sometimes the journey, stalking the prey and preparing the trap, can be as fulfilling as the kill itself if everything works out as expected. 
---
Aren't you kind of assuming CCP went looking for a buyer? Maybe PA simply made an offer the shareholders couldn't refuse.
---
They are cheap as fuck, and really good. They punch about 800% above their price class.
---
Is there any controls involved like kitting an enemy ship? Is this a hardcore P2W? I can see me dropping couple hundreds of dollars when i like the game, but not thousands of dollars. 
---
Well you need to be honest - he is promoting Goons each time he post stuff like this. 
---
Rens forever!
---
Its pay to lose, skill generally trumps shiny ships and I'm still flying frigates even though I've played since 2006.
---
See I love reading threads like this just to see the Dunning-Kruger Effect live.
---
10 rorquals = 10 omega accounts = 10 plex = 2000$/month for CCP         
---
You have real reason why there is so big push on multiboxing in EVE.    
---
CCP is not a non-profit company.        
---
EVE is not for people to have fun ... but for CCP to make cash.    
---
Its as action filled, as you want it to be. Take me for example: Iam a pure producer / trader and love the thrill of the epic 0.01 Isk battles, while i mine my ore far away from the trade hub. Many players consider this boring, i just love it and find it very chill and fun. 
---
If you like space fights i would point you to low sec or wormholes. Plenty of action all the time. :-)
---
Eve Online is a sandbox game; there is no right or wrong. YOU are the center of this universe and YOU create your own action. 
---
Also: Welcome! Enjoy the ride.
---
OH. That sounds like my cup of tea. :) I saw a video saying 'if you dont spend cash' you are in hardmode. 
---
Combination of injectors, excavators, and number crunching, autistic neck beards.  But mainly injectors......
---
not for what they'd pay for me
---
Yes there are keyboard shortcuts for most things. And sure you can just buy the most expensive ships but without real experience you will get molested real quick even by free players.
---
I thought I’ve had found it here untile I saw the comments

I am interested in PVP side of this game. What frightens me is the 'actual consequences' part. I hope that the smaller classes like frigates and destroyers have a place in this game. I don't see me driving a dreadnaught anytime soon.
---
You concept of "insight" seems to be a little off... I mean, you actually don't know shit, you are just speculating based on what looks like reading an article on companies aquisition and that's about it.
---
You should have labeled this as "tinfoil" buddy.

I guess ill try the game :) I had no space in my hard drive, and was wondering if it was worth the trouble of deleting a game. 
---
Masterpiece
---
Thank you for the excellent example.
---
HML Drakes are OK as L3 mission ships but there's others out there that fill the long-range niche better, like sentry drone Myrmidons. 
---
Nice kills
---
I AM assuming that. I don't know it to be a fact. But, in my experience is the more common path and for the reasons stated. The way I read the tea-leaves suggests that this is so.
---
Not exactly, I think we get closer to the truth by discussing things openly. I also believe I have it mostly correct.
---
This is true.
---
Okay let's assume for a second that they would look at the bank accounts and paypal that you volunteered to give them. What guarantee is there, to them, that you aren't sharing the dirty one?
---
You RMT'd, you got caught, you reap what you sow. Enjoy your permaban. I'm sure if you really wanted to you could just make new accounts and inject up as much as you want, and start right where you were beforehand.
---
What group did that? That's awful!
---
Cloak your account and leave it like that please.
---
As far as I remember to back then, it was major heavy missile application changes and a general BC nerf that totally gutted the drake.
---
&gt;12 weeks pirates take over citidel
---
As long as we can hack / settle pirate structures.  Especially sleeper structures have gorgeous designs.  
---
For a lot of legit tradespeople it's really hard to avoid associating with RMTers. Most of them don't carry a big sign saying STAY AWAY FROM ME, and they often offer good deals that you'd be hard-pressed not to take. 
---
Huge sale on skill extractors and ship skins! This week only! (Well, til we announce same sale next week).
---
Bad decisions after bad decisions by ccp. To bad, eve could have gone another 20 with the right choices.

there is something call "official post" saying something like "it will comeback in 2020" but I guess a random reddit user is a better source
---
*In Reality,* Side A has more Capitals by a good amount, but were tackled in the system over by a stream of hero-sabres in an effort to divide and conqueror by side B.
---
If snuffed was a race, racism would be a mainstream virtue
---
thank you for delivering some drama for our entertainment. now dance for us peasant
---
You make an awful lot of assumptions in this entire post, while using words like 'truth' and 'news.' You are, at best, guessing on a number of critical points.
---
1. SP requirement to fly a capital was decreased dramatically.  
---
2. Cost to fly a capital was decreased dramatically.  
---
3. Dynamics of acquiring a capital character changed - yes, the Character Bazaar always existed, but lots of players wanted their own names, and also it was still much more supply constrained than skill injectors. 
---
4. Carrier changes made them much more useful as an all-around tool, rather than more specified (and removal of combat refitting hugely decreased the skill requirement needed to pilot one properly.)
---
These things combined led to the mass over proliferation of capitals. 
---
You should read the Reddiquette guidelines. There is no need for this kind of antagonism.
---
Honestly you have to play it in order to enjoy it. Is like dungeons and dragons watching it does look like much until you are playing it 
---
Oh yes frigs and dessies are just fine, I've been playing for, maybe 5 years and can fly most stuff, but when I solo PvP I fly Thrashers almost exclusively, and it's so satisfying to just delete something 20-50 times more expensive than my ship.
---
More objective, perhaps? More disinterested? More independent of corporate influence?
---
\^ this seems like the advice i am looking for :)

Lies
---
in what he posted rk is side a provi is side b
---
I would say educated and experienced guesswork. I also believe I have it pretty well described, based on ample evidence.
---
I can't get into the details of your personal situation (no idea if you're guilty or not), but this sounds similar to my situation when I was banned back in 201(6?) I'd done some trade deals with a guy who immediately sold all his isk and got perma'd for it. 
---
I petitioned immediately, but it didn't matter - I never got a response, for like 6 months. CCP ignored my tickets for weeks, then closed them with no reply. 
---
My only conclusion is that CCP has a "dead people" list where they just don't answer your mails in any capacity. Nothing you send them will ever be read. This is probably essential to prevent real RMTers from shitting up their inbox with hundreds of mails for every banned bot or mule account (remember the security team is like 3 people), but it means you have no way to contact actual CCP reps. 
---
You can try getting this upvoted enough that /u/ccp_falcon sees it and does something, but in my case all he could do was say "if your tickets are getting closed it means we're 100% sure of your guilt sorry m8" - it's unlikely anyone will review your case based on a reddit post. 
---
In short you're screwed, sorry man. 
---
Potentially it's this that's the problem? You gave him isk after finding out he was confirmed RMTing. Whether or not that was originally his isk, you made a (sizeable) transaction with him after the fact. 
---
Hindsight 20/20 and all that, but ideally you should have put the Isk aside and contacted CCP at that point, informed them of the in game only financial ties you had to him, and requested they determine whether you should return it to him, send it to a GM account to be black-holed, or what. They most likely would have said if it was his isk to send it to him or keep it as your choice (not like they can give you info on what if any action had or will be taken against another's account), but that would at least give them the info of you as a legitimate non-RMT contact - which they could verify so as to whitelist you on his list of associates - and when the transaction flagged it would be a case of "oh yeah, that's that guy, never mind" rather than, "ooh, this looks dodgy _pulls thread_".
---
Don't really have anything helpful given that's not what happened, sorry, but I'm sure they do look at evidence presented even if the tickets aren't responded to. This kind of ban in most games is very much a lengthy process to reverse anything, and they would need to be 100% certain before overruling such a ban. Give them everything you can (if there's anything left), then just give it time: closed tickets may still have their contents attached to an open file somewhere, so there's always hope of an eventual response.
---
Yeah they should help u fine. Name and shame if they dont
---
Note to self, keep my strat away from you
---
Ps. What is your ign?
---
I would agree that as a new player refusing to spend cash on the monthly subscription would make things difficult after a certain point, but other than the subscription there is no "P2W" needed IMO.
---
Eh, most people can't make the defense of "We're both loan sharks who'd been working together for years, and I have the loan records (with Azathio and others) to prove this was my business"
---
It's not like azathio was chucking him 50b at a time and all he ever did was welp faction BS in lowsec. 
---
There are uses for literally every ship size from Frigates to Titans.
---
PA wanted CCP’s P2W secrets seeing that many in our community don’t think eve has ever been that kind of game. 
---
As mentioned: Just start small, learn the ropes. Frigs and dessies are fine. If one dies, just buy another one. :-) 
---
His pronunciations.  
---
HIS PRONUNCIATIONS!

(but, seriously, try to watch that thing at .5 speed.)

I seriously doubt this was the only thing. You were afk and are suddenly unafk the morning after they kick you?
---
I am all cool with monthly subscription. I am currently playing another MMO that requires extensive amounts of investment to become a 'sub-capital ship'. *difference is it does not blow up? :P*
---
No they wouldn’t, lol. They were filled with trash players and had FCs who would run retarded shit like artillery baddons. The only reason they survived is because no one could be fucked to fuck with them.

Yeahp. On the process of deleting fall out 4 :)

Ample evidence? Do we even know if the sale was cash, stocks, or a mix of the two?
---
ok you are definitely retarded
---
So getting blown up doesnt cost as much i am imaging? Heard titans are worth 5k USD. I would most probably delete the game or send a “friendly PM”.
---
Still not what you wrote in your initial post... lol
---
Sleeper dreams
---
It is if you enjoy the idea of flying 280 Drakes.
---
I’d much rather make 4 jumps to Dixie rather than 20 to Jita lol
---
&gt; server send you coordinates for cloaked and offgrid ships... which in all honesty is even more disconcerting
---
AFAIK this is the case even for an unbroken client. There was a post a while ago about how the chinese localization was injected into the client and they mentioned that seeing cloakies was a thing with this as well.
---
Not near the same amount of traffic I saw 2 years ago. Less new players too most ppl there know what they are doing. Still, I’ve been able to find fights you just have to be more patient
---
combination of things.
---
1. eve's been around a while. long time players have stacked up, saved up,  and can afford them more readily.
---
2. large alliances have continually learned from the past, and gotten more and more efficient at industry
---
3. skill injectors to speed up training
---
4. rorquals to speed up mining (and prior to this, mining barge fleets in large alliances)
---
5. citadels to make every system have safe zones, compare to the past where stations in nullsec werent common, and the other option was a POS.
---
6. carriers became more useless, and so more focused on them
---
XIX at the time was not a paper tiger and could form full fleets. It took months of continued grinding for TRI/holy to wear XIX down with continued losses to the point where they couldn’t hold their space, and this was **after** FCON got killed. 
---
So yes, it’s still a far better description than the drivel you’ve written. 
---
I found him. Still an otherwise cool picture. With all the old game/show references.
---
I have so many unique stories a lot of people have different stories that’s what makes the game special. Is it an mmo on rails 
---
At some point, indy indexes are less trouble paying higher isk per job than the cost of moving goods / production to a system with lower index, esp. if it requires putting down a new structure in a low index system
---
No. If you hover over the isk price, you can see that this, comparatively Titan cost ~600$  
---
Or for the same amount of money you could buy 7000 fully fit destroyers.
---
Providence aggressors engaged in this fight with about 2.5:1 numbers advantage over defenders. And were split over 2 systems into manageable size. IDK how that translates to A &amp; B but I'm sorry I got mixed up :D
---
I've heard of the 'old tale of BoB', and how it went down. The story has got me so interested about the game, that it made me actually ask in reddit. 
---
That means it is added to the startup queue. Just wait, usually takes a few seconds,
---
Have you used your verification plex?      
---
Oh.. wow.. I have a tiny *major* feeling that i will love this game :) 
---
It's been 30 minutes.
---
I have no idea what that is.
---
&gt; the meta variety takes a huge hi
---
Fax fights are actually very well balanced and interesting in WHs 
---
Assuming it's a fax on fax fight you now get to play against the enemy fax pilot to fatigue and fluster them. It's a really interesting concept. Granted one fax vs a regular enemy fleet is cancer, but giant fights where you bring through as much as possible, WH mass be dammed, is really engaging. 
---
Anyone remember r/place a few years ago? This kinda reminded me of that for some reason
---
buy a pc and stop expecting potatoes to work? 
---
i miss the chronicles
---
Rorqual overproduction to keep min prices low despite unprecedented demand. ECs also allow for much faster, easier, and safer production of caps over the old POS system - for better or worse. 
---
I almost stopped watching because of season 2. It was becomig a soap opera.
---
Season 3 was damn good. Slower but totally redeemed it
---
Depends a lot on your playstyle, you can be a high sec player and see a pvp fight involving more than two players once in a month, or go for some corps that raids daily... I recommend wormhole space, plenty of challenge, adrenaline and a lot of opportunities to learn how to play for a new player (although without an omega account it's quite hard to survive since you don't have access to cloacking)... 
---
Note that often a raid is 1-2 hours of prep, 5-10 min of action if no response, 30min-1h if response, and then 15-30 min of debrief / making sure everything has cooled down (don't want to miss out on an interesting kill opportunity). So even the Pvp part requires some involvement if you play in a corp, lone wolfing pvp is quite fun although you are pretty much guaranteed to loose your ship
---
Hek market best mRket 
---
Yes. I've done a lil bit of research. Roles fit for Newbies like me seem to be scout and tracker. *Bait can also be included.*
---
They are pretty cheap, isk is easy to get and even if you slowtrain its going to take less than a year
---
I know very well what XIX was capable of and what not. But thats not the point.
---
Its that you claim FCON died because of some bad meta/balancing bullshit. And not because of the faults they made.
---
So. doing lone wolf without omega account is suicide. Doing lone wolf with omega account is a dodo bird with a death wish? Sign me up for the Dodo bird with a death wish XD. I'm not against organizing. But, I have to organize everything in my daily life, why not be a dodo bird in the virtual world? 
---
Just contact then to someone to haul them out. If you were just afk like you said then you'll be fine. 
---
Is that Steve and Stan doing the thriller dance?&gt;
---
Ok
---
Just reapply, I'm sure they'll let you back in.
---
Titans are a real "end game" ship.  By the time you're flying those, you can afford to take the hit.  Remember, the "real world" cost isn't an actual real world cost.  It's an equivalence of in-game currency  (ISK) to how much you can buy with real world money.  There are plenty of people who have multiple accounts that never send a dime to the game.  
---
Also, the hyper expensive ships like that are a real niche ship.  The majority of your ships that you'll be flying end game are 250-500 mil which would be around $2-5 if you are only getting ISK by buying it.  It's still possible to have as much fun in ships far less expensive.  I love going out and fighting until I die in 10 mil ships.  Some corps you join will even have replacement programs where if you lose a ship they'll reimburse you for it.
---
The cost isn't really as high as it'd made out to seem.  There isn't usually real money lost.  You just have to find the right side hustle to fund your losing.
---
if you do it smart with a few friends in a fleet you might be able to lure some weak targets :p just always assume that a fleet of 30 people can jump right in at any moment, the quicker you kill, loot and gtfo the lower the risk
---
as a fleet doctrine? only for lols
---
in small gangs though Drakes, like others have said, are excellent
---
I am not arguing for a removal of rorq multiboxing
---
Amarr appreciates your business!
---
Both are smoldering heaps of rust abandoned by most players, but the difference is only one chooses to stay that way
---
Hek squad was fun times
---
There is so much more. Take any "research" you do with a grain of salt, as there are a lot of uncreative people in this game who cannot think outside of the box.
---
Fit in amarr.
---
Realize they're out of some shit.
---
Ceptor/clone to jita.
---
Buy two and fly back.
---
Profit.
---
It's not just Jita market shitting itself. There's been pretty severe market lag all across Forge (and possibly cluster wide) since DT this morning.
---
I didn’t claim that at all. I claimed they died because they were shit and XIX didn’t bother to defend them. Try reading what I wrote again lol. 
---
And
---
Same here.  This would make a rad poster
---
I think they should remove all but covops cloak and just make a special one for blops.
---
Bots
---
I currently have three BoA bank accounts, one Chase (because of my Visa card which I've used in the past to purchase PLEX) and two Paypal accounts. What you're suggesting is pushing the edge of Occam's Razor. 
---
I guess we are in the same situation then
---
It's not just me then?  I just started playing again after a few years away, and had some trouble in a mission with my Drake I know would have been a breeze before.  They nerfed it?
---
What is the cause of this? 
---
ccp support are actually such unbelievably trash
---
they constantly falsely permaban people and they know this because there's many such cases but they still refuse to work with you
---
i wonder if it's hilmar's doing or if theyre all just shit people like falcon is
---
Occam's Razor says you were caught, got banned, and now want to play the sympathy card and mass appeal to reddit to stir some shit up. just like everybody else who went public after they got banned for RMT.
---
&gt; If Eve was rocketing upward in profitability, they would not have offered to sell their shares to anyone.
---
I’ll take how to raise capital for further expansion for 1bazliion Alex. Selling equity, even when your company is profitable, is a way to retain steady growth. Profitability =/= growth. Additionally, sometimes the board wants to take profit for their successes and sell their shares to others. So clearly you weren’t senior enough to experience this. 
---
&gt;That money is based on a scenario developed by the acquirer to justify the expenditure. In other words, the HIGHEST BIDDER must be paid back out of the acquired company's earnings. This puts tremendous financial pressure on the acquired company after the acquisition.
---
DAE how does due diligence work?

&gt;the rest of this post 
---
I know how M&amp;A works, I was manager at a Popeyes right as Burger King bought them”
---
\*looks at bodies of  calmil and galmil
---
Treat every ship you undock in Eve as ammo - not a shiny expensive boat. Play with the expectation that it won't come home and you'll be good.
---
Ok well this is probably the dumbest thing I’ll read today
---
Dont you like buying basic T2 modules for 900% markup???? Stop being racist amarr supremacist they need the isk. 
---
\+ no 50 billion russian mobile depots, cancer undocks, etc. 
---
&gt; How is your experience in the game? Is it action packed? Or is it the opposite of that?
---
It's a player driven sandbox, so it's what you make of it. Sometimes I'd love to just chill so I'll go do exploration, ratting or salvaging runs. If I'm in the mood for PVP, I'll go reship and join a fleet (not too big on solo pvp) and go hunting with them.
---
&gt; do you use the key board?
---
All the time. I'm always smashing my spacebar every few seconds to perform a directional scan.
---
How long does a ship stickbaround after you eject from it?
---
It's not your RAM, I play this on a Ryzen 4core and 4GB RAM with a gtx1070.
---
Probably your latency 
---
My spies are spying your spies while your spies are spying my spies spying your spies spying my spies doing spy things.

As you say, Your Grace.
---
8 gb of ram costs like $40. What’s stopping you from replacing your 4 gb?
---
Since you play eve and probably don’t go outside: that’s like the price of 2 Plex.
---
I am going to add more memory soon.
---
It probably helps that I was nerding out over aero since I was a kid haha. 
---
1) As far as Airbus goes, I don't see the 380 cancellation as a huge issue for them. EADSY was still operating at a profit while it was ongoing, and the rest of their portfolio is still pretty strong - the 320neos should mostly amortised if not entirely thanks to their relatively low "development" cost, the C-series (I refuse to call it a 220) is basically a money printer for them thanks to BCA, and the 350 family is much better positioned for modern long-haul/high-volume routes than the 380 was IMO.
---
Throw in the 737 shitstorm Boeing is experiencing driving narrowbody sales towards Airbus and shaking Boeing's public perception, and I see them as being in a fairly good position. Most recent prediction I heard was something like $600B in potential narrowbody sales...
---
2) As for CCP, their sales model's the inverse of aero. Main products are fully paid in advance, and then CCP has to deliver (sub model, Plex) over a given period of time, so backlog isn't a factor here.
---
Getting a bit out of my field now, but regarding the acquisition of CCP, I'd see their value being primarily in their single-shard tech &amp; customer engagement (things PA may want to adopt/learn from to enhance the rest of their portfolio) and secondarily the predicted stability of revenues from EVE due to the small but dedicated player base.
---
IMO, if they can use CCP know-how to improve their other titles and whatever's cooking now, it's very possible that even if they end up losing money on EVE itself somehow (alienating the vets without improving retention?), the benefits to their other products could wind up making it a "profitable" investment. 
---
Just a word of advice: replace, don’t add. Unless you know exactly what kind of ram that’s already in there, and even then, it doesn’t always work.
---
I recommend you buy one stick of 8, and if you want to upgrade, you can buy the exact same thing down the road.
---
how did you get the money to do that much loan ?
---
Thera
---
I do know exactly what's in there, and I tried to add another stick of 4GB which I borrowed from another laptop and it worked.

Love it, much better than all the tryhard alliances who want their 50 man mining alliance sound grand and regal
---
Download more RAM.
---
Dont worry nolak, Ive taken your place keying up when someone talks about isk shortages asking if they want a loan :p
---
I assumed that’s what it’s meant to say. It seems a bit of a bizarre thing to say, but mine always says that; it works fine.
---
If yours isn’t working, it’s not because of that.
---
To complete the meme, find a system where the next system in the autopilot route is 'A' for Jita, and 'B' for Amarr/Dodi.
---
It’s actually quite hard to explain 
---
It is definitely intense, not all the time, but it is.
---
I was brought up on Elite (the original) so manually piloting from first person view was the norm and seems naturally more immersive.
---
I came to Eve from Homeworld which has a similar view and initially although you may want to see your ship and face the way it’s facing, actually the immersion and intensity doesn’t revolve around seeing your ship in flight. It comes from the engagement your about to embark on, some of which is in your head, but most of which takes up your brain’s processing power!
---
&gt; I love it when a person argues against their self. You try and make the point that 'the super umbrella is too strong!', while also saying you killed 2 supers within that last 24 hours, and have stolen trillions of isk in drones
---
If I had a dollar for every brainlet linking me the Rorq/super killmails in Delve against my argument on that they are not dying at a sufficient rate, I'd be rich by now. 
---
&gt; So looking at the January MER Delve made 27 tril between ratting and mining. That's 450mil per month per toon, how is that game breaking exactly?
---
I did not argue that the farm itself is game breaking. I argued that [only 3% of that farm dying](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1goutrhQADKczT9MLzA47Crdf3JwsVu5PNDHKN_qIvTs/edit#gid=391531178) is game breaking.
---
upping it to level 5 BS at the very least would help, its wierd that caps are level 3 BS

Ya then get gate camped by a bunch of neckbeards with no life sounds like a great idea
---
Are you telling me you can't alpha a 170k EHP structure with a subcap fleet and then light your cyno in a 2000 vs 2000 tidifest? If you are that incapable, how about fleet warping to grid?
---
There are ways to fight n+1. There is a reason why huge empires collapsed in real life. They became too large to control. If you force umbrellas to spread out and split by anom rework, there won't be too much of a point to stick together as an alliance of 40k people.
---
The narrative on why exactly they collapsed doesn't matter. What matters is they did, and then most of them joined Goons/TEST because they could.
---
I've been a player on and off since 2008, but I really don't enjoy PVP and am much more into logistics/manufacturing. It's been a couple years since I played (more or less since Provibloc got temporarily evicted)- has there been anything added/being added soon to the game to make it worth playing for industrialists in that time, or is it still all PVP focused?
---
Couldn't you deploy them in a smaller ship first to mitigate this issue? It would still take some fine tuning.
---
When I base my singular points on highly elaborated, well-explicated issues with game balance you blame me for inconciseness.
---
If I didn't base my points on anything you'd blame me for just arguing for my self-interest.
---
There is just no winning with some of you.
---
I believe it’s only until the next downtime, but that may have changed 
---
why u mar tho?
---
Enjoy your ban.
---
Aralis in a mach :0

I always used to think of that line when I sent my indy alt to Amarr. I think I liked that game more than a lot of people did. 
---
o7
---
The problem is, it says that, but never starts.
---
log in to account management and you should see the transactions you paid with your CC/debit to purchase monthly or yearly game time for your 12 accounts.
---
thats like &gt;$1200 yearly.
---
on my account I can't see monthly subs I bought with plex, maybe thats why you cant find it?  
---
Nothing we can do about it, we can't even believe you as we don't have the tools to investigate your claims.
---
How so? Tier 3 is what every other ship requires to get to the next size tier 
---
Hey man, just wanted to say thanks for this ! It's a really useful and applicable write up for someone who doesn't know where to start.
---
 Coming back to the game after a long while , looking for a corp to start doing things with, your post  was exactly what I needed. 
---
Awww, poor little thing. I love see little shits like this get what they deserve. Then they want to whine to everyone who will listen that they were treated sooooooo unfair. 
---
Boo fucking hooo.  HTFU! 
---
Oof this makes me wanna trade again
---
Move to a 5. You guys are big enough, take the training wheels off. 
---
Hek? What about Rens!!!? Shit man I used to live in that neighborhood, it's really gone downhill.
---
Thank you for demonstrating it to the rest of us. 
---
Industry has been a huge focus for most of nullsec for a long time now (several years at least). The nullsec empires understand now that having a strong industrial backbone is essential to survival and success. The Goons are widely regarded as being the first to fully embrace this, creating infrastructure and supporting their miners as much as possible, and this (among other things) has led them to become the dominant entity in the game. 
---
So I would say an industrialist now will be accepted with open arms into most large organizations in known space. 
---
Local too please
---
Maybe because T2 BS are similar skill requirement and isk cost but vastly inferior to carriers in most aspects.   Pirate BS are about half the isk cost and have some utility but still don't compare to carriers.   
---
where did i mention goons?
---
I used to solo multibox VG incursions (and fly with the HQ fleets). When input broadcasting was banned, I put the accounts on ice after attempting a rattlesnake doctrine. When Skill Extractors were a thing, I extracted them all and used some but sold most of the injectors. 
---
Is it the first time you’ve launched the game ? 
---
You guys must be cardinals or monks... i cant imagine not getting upset. But, if i had money to spare, i guess i wouldnt care so much.
---
Hey, I just started an eve account. Seems like something I would enjoy a lot. I joined minmatar and I probably want to stick to exploration/non pvp stuff for a while. Do I get locked into that if I go down that route? I'll still get to blow stuff up every once and a while, right?
---
this is a game with a pretty steep learning curve. I'm a little under 10 hours in and I am still looking around thinking, "wtf am I doing?" all the time. Anyone have a good intro guide to read or youtube to watch?
---
Best comment ever!
---
Good, they need to be harder on those who bot and RMT. Bye bye.
---
So high customization on your toon? That is nice. But i better follow a guide till i know better. :)
---
Curious why your reddit account is active relatively often, but you were unable to contact us on discord.
---
I could enjoy the game without paying money, or i can pay and be more enjoyable with it? But, whatever decision i would make would be decided a bit later on.
---
I'm not attacking you I'm stating a fact
---
CODE, under 500 wars. Small fry, they are. 
---
It is my callin? Leeroy jekins! XD
---
I'm not in a coalition. Also good to know you handicap yourself for no reason
---
Yes. 
---
See, on rollerskates. THERES NO COUNTER...gets shown the counter....THAT DOESNT COUNT.
---
Yes, it shows that without an alternative, people will in fact still use them. If null had no alternative, they'd use them.
---
Did you get in? I've been reading about some lag and stuff but you could try clearing cache from within the launcher
---
no u?
---
Ah, my bad, misunderstood you there. 
---
Triglavians
---
&gt; CCP see's an account taking hundreds of billions from a known RMT'er
---
this is a really common problem that reddit posters (and the community at large) make, frighteningly often
---
there are people who *sell* to RMT groups, and people who *buy* from RMT groups
---
azathio was most likely *selling* to RMT groups (judging by the context), which means that none of the isk that he loaned to nolak *came* from RMT. thus, none of the isk that nolak had from azathio was tainted, it didn't come from dirty sources like account hacking or botting (probably), it came from goons paying interest to azathio, which means that nolak probably isn't complicit in RMT (at least insofar as he didn't help azathio commit the actual RMT, although his assistance in lending probably helped azathio make more money to sell)
---
[here's a helpful diagram](https://i.imgur.com/vqBwy8Z.png)
---
this really steams me up because people wanted to call lenny an RMTer, which, while he was definitely associating with RMTers and possibly complicit in their schemes (at least due to furthering IWI interests if nothing else), none of the isk he had came from any rmt-tainted sources - it all came from people paying into IWI with legitimately acquired isk, and none of the isk he received as a payout from the game was RMT isk. people (mostly goons) kept saying that anyone who got paid lennybux was going to get their corp wallets negged and that never happened even after the ban
---
because that's not what happens when you take isk from someone *selling* to rmt sites
---
Oh and rorquals enabling the minerals needed to build them to be produced much faster :)
---
Amarr love
---
I'm more talking about gameplay styles / strategies vice a specific character. Eve is about the how/why rather than the what/where.
---
Are these the Highsec griefing Corps that are destroying new player retention? 
---
You're getting ripped off doe there's like a 10% to 20% price gap 
---
It's still not doing anything at all. How do I clear the cache from within the launcher?
---
Not ddr4
---
Oh. The first one was very well made. 
---
The second one is my environment. :) 
---
This is the real eve ey? :) 
---
Pretty on point comment. Can confirm, voltron discord has the good memes. 
---
Ahhh got it.
---
Right this happened to me and my son also. First launch never works. I’ve no idea if it’s the same for everyone.
---
I would crash out of the game. Restart your pc if necessary and try again. If it still persists, uninstall and reinstall.
---
Assume your rig meets the minimum requirements ?

---
same
---
&gt;Do I get locked into that if I go down that rout
---
You get locked into whatever skill tree you go down just by the nature of training skills. At least for a little bit. 
---
&gt;Anyone have a good intro guide to read or youtube to watch
---
There really isnt one, and making videos and guides is so hard it's q meme recognized by CCP themselves. I recommend watching https://youtu.be/ui7ZTlfNngc as a good overview and then cross reference interesting stuff on the eve university website. 
---
Maybe if ishtars weren't 250mil in null and 230mil on the other side of a wormhole i'd consider it.
---
&gt;but the Kikimora (destroyer) is a great kiter
---
Dont tell anyone, but you can get close to 800 dps out at 50k with a kiki 
---
If he has 4gb, you can bet it ain’t ddr4
---
just want to chime in here and say i believe you, peligro has a history of banning innocent people and never explaining himself, unbanning anyone, or apologizing
---
i'm sorry, but you're probably not going to get unbanned, and that sucks
---
Still better than getting killed by P I R A T or some other war deccers. Also the biggest ship I buy is a Thorax so the price gap isn't really big.
---
Even Rens is better than Hek
---
it's just peligro being peligro
---
carriers were pretty cheap pre-citadel sure, but the citadel patch changed the build cost of carriers from \~900m to \~1.5b. Rorqs + ecs have driven the price down to approximately their pre-patch cost despite the increase in mineral requirements.
---
the cost of capitals isn't really whats causing their proliferation, thoraxes are cheap but no-one flies a thorax doctrine because there are ships that do everything thoraxes do but better. Capitals, carriers specifically, proliferated because the citadel patch buffed them beyond reason. If capitals were garbage no-one would fly them, instead capitals are incredibly strong so they're used for everything
---
Selling overpriced things: go to Hek
---
Buying cheap things: go to Rens
---
Gotcha, interesting. That’s a heavy handed nerf, but I do remember how strong it was.
---
&gt;I had no space in my hard drive
---
Time to make new space then :] 
---
Well i am, as this is fucking up the game, same for ability to extract 100% what you trained.         
---
This is fucking up the game.            
---
There is no niche markets and jobs for new and small people  - when accounts are free. 
---
Welcome to how EVE used to be.
---
BS / guns / engineering / respective shield or armor skills. 
---
They know provi literally cannot do anything on it's own. Especially after being nuetered by PL and frens.
---
Join a corp
---
Do this atleast for when you start, so you have social contact. Eve is hugely about social stuff (your alliance/ friends) and it'll get boring if you don't. But becareful when choosing who to join and leave if you dislike who you joined
---
Change
---
My
---
Mind
---
It's just a fact of life you gotta deal with in Eve. You will lose a LOT of ships, can't get bent out of shape too long over any single one of them. Can it make you mad sometimes? Sure, but then you suck it up and undock again. 
---
direct trade
---
This explain why i see this stuff 20-30 AU away.       
---
Usually asteros ... lol. 
---
&gt;upping it to level 5 BS 
---
That's how it used to be, and I have mixed feels about changing it.
---
Unknown, but according to my bug report on it it appears that CCP is aware of the problem as my bug report status has been changed from open to attached.
---
Well If hes inocent i dont see how that's good 
---
That's not a crippling amount of Isk.
---
I would personally try to fire sale it.
---
I remember you from back then, me and my mighty legion fleet and then paladins :)
---
I just got it myself. I clicked Yes and it instantly reconnected without hesitation. /shrug
---
Lol yeah it's dead jim
---
I bet it is. BTW if you want cheap ddr3 go on eBay and buy old dead servers with a crap ton of RAM 
---
#THE PURGE
---
I know you are. But there is no going back to times of rarity of multiboxers and capitals.
---
The only solution is making sure that multiboxers and capitals die at a good rate and create content for others.
---
Get a jita alt and contract it to a highsec hauler it's cheaper.
---
Their screwing with you. Just close the launcher and try again, the game is only 15 years old, so not all the bugs have been fixed yet. ;)
---
I cant really imagine,  another person trusting another person in Eve,   with loaning isk.  Its a recipe for disaster?  Its why we once had the 3th party brokers like Chribba? 
---
I cant really follow the logic guilty by association,  some random nerd quiting the game sends you isk..  CCP bans you and says its RMT?  Because the account character was flagged for RMT.   If that would be true,  we could remove all the players we hate quite easilly,  just start buying isk a few $ and name every enemy player you can think off.  
---
Theres prolly something else and i dont think CCP wants to reveil their method.  
---
Thats an aweful idea...
---

---
Yes you get skillpoints, I think 250k, that's like 5 days of training. Person who refers you gets something like, 350plex now as soon as you upgrade to omega, and usually will agree to split that reward with you.
---
When I was newish (10 year vet) and carriers required the racial BS to V it was a lot harder to change between capitals. I got my Cal V and was so excited for my Widow and Chimera. And 1 or 2 big content patches later they changed it...
---
See, that is why you use slaves in Amarr. Low wage workers rights? Psssh. Crack the whip and pass the savings on to the consumer. 
---
My chat windows in game were cycling between "lost connection to chat" and "reconnected to chat" every second or so. Some of my corpmates seem to have it and others don't.
---
2 of the old PLEX. that would be 1000 now
---
given that players are capable of using things like intel channels and coordinating defence fleets, whereas bots are really only capable of using local to avoid fights, it would definitely having a greater effect on bots than on real players
---
also dscan is far from a perfect replacement for local since it leads to a lot more false positives. Local, when working properly, is able to give you perfect information on the blue/neut/hostile status of people entering system whereas dscan just tells you that someone is nearby, not any info about your relationship to them. Wormhole groups will sometimes have unique tags added to ship names to get around this, but they tend to be fairly well known for larger groups and its really easy to just add a tag from the group your hunting to your ships name
---
&gt;I didn’t just do loans; I freely handed out ISK and ships to new players, would happily spend time talking to them about ratting and EVE in general, and had a stash of fits in PYFA to hand out. 
---
Sending isk and ships to new accounts is not RMT 101 or anything...
---
So just turn off all of the graphics?
---
A common saying in Eve is don’t fly what you can’t afford to lose, and another one is consider any ship lost the moment you undock. If it comes back alive you’re lucky. 
---
The in game ways of making money are easy enough to pay for the ships you’d lose without too much grinding, as long as you don’t try to pay for the sub with in game money or buy injectors. Especially if you are omega, exploration in Sansha’s Nation space is extremely lucrative, although it’s also pretty dangerous until you figure some things out. 
---
So people who unexpectedly lose ships worth half their net worth do rage all the time. But most of us stop using ships like that pretty quick. 
---
You buy ships one at a time? Weird.
---
He was given 100b by a known RMT, sorry but I'm not buying it.
---
Just contract it to a space trucker, they will move it for.a pittance. I've seriously paid like 1.5 mil per jump in HS
---
How much is 350 plex? Never heard if this currency. Ive heard of isk
---
As long as there is 1 catalyst for sale in Jita the game isn't dead
---
-James315
---
so long as your mass before you activate your prop mod is &lt;300m your fine, after you jump while the jump is being processed theres a moment where you can activate your prop mod to make your ship bigger than the mass of the hole would normally allow. This is how carrier rolling in high class space works.
---
basically spam jump -&gt; activate prop mod and you can get more than the mass limit of the hole through
---
1 plex is about 3.9 mil isk, you need to pay 500 plex for a month of Omega time.
---
Of course, yet again, it's prefect time to hunt krabicci and I'm away for social interactions
---
#F
---
He's AFK, quick get back there and kill it. J/k, just be glad you got out.
---
REEEEEEEEEE
---
Lol no he wasnt, I didnt add it cuz you can only post 1 image but about 30 seconds before I warped off I had burned to gate and he had lock on me, just awkwardly waiting whats next. I anticipated he’d attack so I would jump through but he didn’t
---
People still use Windows 7? lol
---
Yep. People like me with old laptops that most likely cant run windows 10 well xD
---
they're not destroying much of anything as long as you're not an idiot. get an off-grid insta-undock and scout out the popular gates before you go through them, like new caldari-jita gate
---
confirmed, chat is taking a shit again.
---
(as well as warpin animation again, as ships just appears on the gates instantly when warping in)
---
gj ccp
---
Um yes, I still miss XP, was forced to move to 7 just because my software had incompatibility issues with newer OSes :(
---
&gt;Fleet (202)
---
&gt; At any rate, I already argued everyday spontaneous warfare is more important for the meta than your tidifests that happen once in a year with no real effect.
---
And there are tons of people who would disagree, feeling that the big fights are what matter to them.  That is subjective.  The fact of the matter is, if a super cap fleet has dominance of say a keepstar grid, maintaining that cyno jammer, or multiple cyno jammers wouldn't be terribly difficult, especially with max fax reps on it.
---
Ok, so you're suggesting to go from a 175m rolling BS to a what, 1b?, blops BS to get 33% more mass per jump?
---
1.5m per hs jump is pretty high tbh, i think some haulers made some mad bank off you while you were like "lmao wage slaves"
---
As someone who works in IT, i fucking do not miss XP.
---
Going back to it sometimes to work on peoples PCs is disgusting. The file management system is complete shit comparatively. 
---
Why did you try to hide the system, especially when you left nearly every indicator there Xd
---
Idk lol
---
Which is probably caused by Norton using half your system resources.
---
Underpaid? More like overpaid, right?
---
I dont really have a reason to use Windows 10 anyways
---
the general guideline is that grinding for isk is a thing most people do, and some people make more than others
---
but, all but the absolute most profitable activities in game (c6 wormhole pve, large scale industry and trading) still make less isk per hour than you make working at an irl job and just buying plex to sell
---
I just noticed that. lol
---
New at pvp?
---
Mate the games near 16 years old, back when i started over 10 years ago. It only took around 18/24 months to make a half decent carrier pilot. Over a long period of time just more and more people have trained them up. Injectors have accelerated the process a little, but it still takes 20+ bill to inject a bare bones carrier with fuck all core skills.  
---
I demand 5 mill sp
---
dont forget the changes in process to build them. no longer do you need the pos setup
---
https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=4b0d8ec1-cf51-407e-be32-c842674b0eff
---
You can use Mine and I will Share the isk  with you when you go omega :) 
---
Also I am mostly running around in WOrmhole space and low sec so if you have any beginner questions regarding exploration, industry or pvp fell free to pm me and I will give you some heads up :)
---
I'm also in Goons, so 1.5 mil per jump was stupid cheap for me. I think I paid 28m to get something from Jita to Oursulaert
---
You will soon, Microsoft is discontinuing updates any security fixes won’t get patched.
---
CCP made them more accessible and more useful, and injectors made cap alts easier to acquire.   My opinion probably isn’t popular in his reddit, but I’ve enjoyed eve much more since the capital changes and proliferation. 
---
Exactly. Ships are just the opportunity cost of fun in Eve. You make it home? Isk positive. Lol. 
---
When?
---
Jan 14 2020
---
The real question is, why did you go straight to shitposting about it on reddit rather than hopping on discord or sending Receg or one of the directors a mail?
---
Got chat in wormhole space, suddenly many new players felt like playing the game. Odd
---
Nice twitter bro, at this rate you're out of places to shop since you've sworn everywhere off. 
---
Tldr: piece of shit gets what's coming to him. Next.
---
Eve has graphics? Since when?
---
Removing the alternatives in k-space would mean eliminating every single NPC station. Suffice to say that it probably ain't happening.
---
Give me your 4gb and I'll double it. 
---
you dont that is why they am clean, you use 3rd and 4th party's to move stuff like alpha clones its not hard to set up clean accounts you just hard to be smart with using them to not leave a api trail 
---
You are never"locked in" to what you are training. You can change it at any time, even mid skill if you want. That being said you don't get the benefit of a skill until you finish it, so it is better to stick to a plan unless there is something you need right now that you didn't plan for.  
---
As far as resources go, there is no singular resource on anything, the closest we have is the [EVE-Uni Wiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page), which can often be incomplete or old when looking for things like ship fittings. It is a great resource on some topics though, and will at least give you an overview of whatever you want to know.  
---
Other Resources:  
---
[Fuzzworks](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/) \- A great site with a bunch of industry and other tools  
---
[zKill](https://zkillboard.com/) \- Records almost every kill and loss in the game. A good place to get ideas for fits. Just remember, everything   
---
on there is there because they died.
---
[Eve-Survival](https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=HomePage) \- A bit outdated, but it covers all missions and DED sites, what the triggers are, and what to expect.
---
There are tens of other great tools or resources, but they are for the most part specific to one area of the game. Don't think of EVE as one game that you can master, there are people who have been playing for more then 10 years and still don't know everything. Instead, think of it as tens of different games all in the same sandbox. Pick one area and learn that first, then maybe branch out to other areas that tangentially impact what you're doing and expand your knowledge that way. 
---
There are two ways to play without paying.
---
First option is to just stay an "Alpha" (think trial account).  There's nothing wrong with alpha and in a lot of respects, you can play the game just as well in that way, it's just gonna be a bit tougher.  You won't get access to a lot of the more powerful ships or weapons but if you play smart, you'll still be able to have just as much fun.
---
The other way is called "plexing."  It means trading in-game currency for memberships other players paid for with real money.  This can be a bit of a grind, though, and starts to make the game into a job versus a hobby.  Depending on how you like to play, you'll have to skip doing the things you want in order to make more ISK.  I really wouldn't recommend a new player doing this.  It'll burn you out pretty quick.
---
Who are you?
---
Deal! Meet me outside Jita 4-4. :^)
---
&gt;  That is subjective.
---
No it's not because we're not talking about what matters to whom personally.
---
We are talking about what actually shapes the meta, mostly by guiding decisions on who joins what alliance. Krabbing safety is #1 priority there. Not how many Keepstars your alliance kills, or how competent your FCs are.
---
&gt; multiple cyno jammers
---
You cant anchor jammers in range of each other. That wouldn't change in my proposal.
---
&gt; Max fax reps
---
2 artillery naglfars volley it off from 40km. 4-5 from 150km. Or 30 polarized bombers. All you need find or create a warpable spot. Or get a chain boosh doctrine. 
---
We can even think about range deterioration after 30 minutes, making it irreparable (as long as it has the range), or disallowing anchorable bubbles around it. Your issue is not solvable.
---
Amarr is stupid expensive right now.  Especially faction ammo.
---
Probably, I was more worried about a rorqual just sitting in a belt and being able to deploy 2 different depos while siedged by spamming deploy until they land far enough apart. 
---
Hi I'm also willing to split the isk if you go omega as well as help you out. I'm in a corp based at edge of high sec near jita and we do pretty regular stuff in low/null sec. Here's my link. 
---

---
Your time must be cheap... Beware the false economy of distant markets... https://zkillboard.com/kill/75700615/
---
RAM probably isnt your issue.  Generally CPU or internet connection is.  RAM is almost never the bottleneck.
---
NEVER use only 1 stick.  Most every CPU this millenium supports dual channel memory.  2 4Gb is much better than 1 8Gb.
---
How is the game?
---
It's harsh, cold, lonely, boring, intense, warm, friendly and rewarding at the same time. There is no single option about it except one - it takes time away from you. 
---
If you have girlfriend or wife she will hate name Eve. Many people consider Eve as a second job (first if you don't have one). It's reasonably complex and deep to spend years just learning about it. It's not p2w yet* and constantly dying* for last 10 years or so. And it has best and crasiest community you ever seen.
---
* pfff rumors
---
Mixing RAM is perfectly fine.  It will just run at the speed of the slowest module.
---
u infinity.
---
The FAX was likely for the carriers since it has armor rep's and the Machs were shield fit, Mach fleet also had \~13 scimitars with them.
---
I think you've confused Eve Online with Microsoft Office 365.
---
If the biggest you fly is a thorax then why care if it gets blown up?  That is bought and fit for pennies
---
Yes, in fact if you google it you can find the model work in progress. Its also in the Invasion World Tour image.
---
thx for the tip. yep i'm going to fly 500k ships for a while and focus on building my bankroll.
---
They should remove your suggestions from the subreddit
---
Thanks for the quality links. It is a cool game. 
---
Hahahaha nice post
---
Wow, thanks for taking the time with this...very interesting insights on both elements.
---
You don't see the frantic scrolling through Intel channels, dicord batphoning, organizing comms channels, reading Dotlan, checking your alt's cloaky eyes,checking your spy's discord feeds and other actions that are taking place in the metagame during the gating. 
---
Formal war declarations are distinct from suicide ganking.
---
The number of wars declared does not reflect CODE activity as a whole.
---
Wow, you guys managed to get a spy in to a corp. Nobody has ever done that before.....
---
I mean, is it really an accomplishment to brag about shit like that in a dying game? Maybe if it were at the height of Eve back in the early teens, but now it's like trying to brag about being the Goldeneye world champion. 
---
The argument is that new players don't know that, and frequently lose ships and become frustrated with the one-sidedness of the game they experience that they quit before they learn such things.
---
rip Yulai! 
---
I don't disagree with what you describe as sometimes happening with the sale of equity. If you know this topic, you know that's not what we are likely seeing here...for many obvious reasons. I think you may be trying to sell a story for reasons of your own...good luck with that.
---
Also, if you think due diligence invalidates the financial pressure aspect...then you live in a fairy land...or are an academic...but I repeat myself.
---
Finally, thanks for the toxic hostility and personal insults. 
---
Thanks for the hate, but, not sure why you would object to this reply.
---
If it were 100% cash or 100% stock, would that change the dots you can very obviously connect on the revenue side and the implications for price/value?
---
What the HEK happened to RENS? 
---
Considering there was a wormhole basically directly to jita, and its cheaper to manufacture out in null and the materials are more directly available i'm not going to feed more profit into greedy mofos.
---
And what's up with this killmail hows this relevant?
---
You do know there's no point in talking to cactus Jack
---
If you get frustrated from losing ships in highsec and don't realize you should leave or adapt, EVE is not the game for you. This whole game is about losing and killing ships.
---
That awful noise made it extremely difficult to jerk off to that Typhoon video. Not impossible though.
---
lol
---
Who buys Drakes in Jita?
---
I don't get this post. The change wasn't ever intended or going to change who declared the most wars, it was supposed to improve the actual lethality and enjoyability of wars and improve the # of wardecs.
---
Its just not possible to defend himself without extreme effort from CCP.
---
He would have to show CCP all of his financial accounts, which is of course possible. But then prove that he doesnt have any other financial accounts and hasnt received cash or any other compensation for his RMT. Thats not possible.
---
So if your friend IRL gives you $20 because you need it then it's cool for the cops to arrest you because, as it turns out, that $20 was stolen?
---
In this situation, you would get an opportunity to prove your innocence. I think that's all Nolak wants. Don't see why that's a bad thing. 
---
I would agree with you; just pointing out the counter-argument that QueenJezebel seems to have misunderstood.
---
Explosions make us great!
---
well, tough shit. this is eve, they need to learn
---
What is Highsec?
---
Give it time. 
---
Ave, true to Caesar
---
“This whole game is about losing and killing ships”  
---
Seems goons haven’t gotten that memo, they seem like it’s all about blobbing to avoid fighting.
---
It's a guy who bought a super is lowsec - presumably cheap than we make them in Impass... But lost it on the move home
---
You kind of forgot to mention where most of your loans were 100% collateral.
---
Yoooo shout out to Tessa-a he’s my bud. 
---
&gt;Imagine hundreds of miners and anomaly farmers, previously losing 15-20% of their farm to PvPers, are now losing a mere 3% of it (source). There is nowhere much left to go in null for spontaneous of PvP. From NPSI fleets to roamers from lowsec to null, from solo blopsers to wormhole ragerollers, every small PvP entity have experienced a deprivation of content, which in return diminished their interest in the game and willingness to log in.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;On the other hand, CCP preferred the farmer side because pushing people to Rorqual multiboxing and super ratting provided a huge income boost before the sale to PA through the sales of PLEX and skill extractors. But this was a finite buff with an expiration day. Once all asset-collectors of Eve have all the assets they need, they won't spend more to PLEX or injectors. They won't even login much. And we have began to experience this expiration by the end of this year (check MER declines in heavy farmed regions, and it will decline further).
---
See I read this statement, but you haven't proven anything. Why is 15-20% the 'correct' amount, and 3% a 'bad' amount? People as a whole, have gotten better at defending their assets as a team. Combine that fact with the reduction of jump ranges and the introduction of fatigue, and you have people willing to randomly boson gates in their space because they know the people with the ability to kill them can't actually get there. Seriously pull up dotlan and attempt to find a lowsec staging point to put dreads in that can hit the region, it doesn't exist. 
---
This is the issue with the 'nerf everything' mentality. Every time you nerf capitals, you make the 'umbrella' stronger, not weaker. Cause first it will be capitals, then we'll respond by using jump gates instead, then you'll want that nerfed, and the cycle continues.
---
 You want increased risk in null? Ok I can get behind that idea undo a lot of the proposed changes to anoms, carriers, and rorqs (other than the panic module reduction). Then add the following.
---
\#1. 45 second delay on local.
---
\#2. Double jump ranges. 
---
This will enable small gangs to actually catch solo VNI/Ishtars/Botters. While also allowing large entities to stage dread bombs for moron titans that like to boson gates. 
---
This is not the type of information you want to be public, delete or edit your post.
---
This problem is very specific to buying capital ships at public markets. It has very little to do with buying subcap hulls at significant discount and importing them.
---
And i don't blame him for trying to get a better deal if you guys are greedily gouging people up there. I've seen the PZMA market, makes me glad i live in Catch. 
---
Eve can be played countless ways. I do small nano gangs. It is pretty exhilarating when you hold grid with 20 dudes chasing after you!
---
 Eve takes tons of knowledge, skill and alot of time, but the reward is one of the most engaging games there is. Honestly it's not for everyone, and it's tough getting started as a new player but once you get your first solo kill and your hands are shaking, you will never go back!
---
It's like pew pew woosh kaboom
---
Just try it.
---
There's something wrong with the game, when an entity can do over 500 wardecks in 3 months. Make them pick and choose by limiting the active amount and not just spray wardecks at everyone and everything.
---
When checking P I R A T - they have 111 active wardecks (687 finished in 2019), while The Marmite Collective has 78 (892 finished in 2019). That is just retarded.
---
I did not know that, but I'm beginning to learn. Please, enlighten me.
---
I wouldn't bitch if they did though, at the very least in lowsec and 0.0.  Citadel upgrades that brought agents from your region's NPCs in would handle the mission LP part of it.
---
&gt; Why is 15-20% the 'correct' amount, and 3% a 'bad' amount? 
---
Because every single PvE capital loss of a single person is content for potentially hundreds of players who are looking for PvE capitals to kill that night. The way to make Eve healthy is to ensure more ships dying. One of the ways ships die in Eve is by taking risks (risk of dying to some group) for PvE rewards (monetary reward of mining).  Think of this as a "content tax" that the PvE player is paying. CCP can adjust content tax by making it easier or harder for these ships to die.
---
If CCP taxes 100% of the ratter's money for content, they won't rat anymore. If CCP taxes 50%, then it will still be annoying to lose half your income. But CCP taxes it 3%, then it will be too low and people looking for content will be starving and leaving the game. Which is what's been happening. 20% is a way better balance between the risk and the reward.
---
&gt; People as a whole, have gotten better at defending their assets
---
People didn't get better. Mechanics have changed for the defenders' interests. You couldn't have stacked 40k accounts in a single region and address their krabbing needs before. When that becomes available, of course some people will do it and then you'll see bosoning titans at each gate.
---
&gt; This is the issue with the 'nerf everything' mentality. Every time you nerf capitals, you make the 'umbrella' stronger, not weaker. Cause first it will be capitals, then we'll respond by using jump gates instead, then you'll want that nerfed, and the cycle continues.
---
This isn't making sense. 
---
Nope... The false economy of buying cheap hulls and having to transport them yourself is universal... I'm not saying it's impossible to get a good deal and profit from it, but if you need to buy it in a highsec hub, bring it a few systems away to the wormhole (past highsec wardeccers) and bring it through some wormholes to catch - and you're only saving like 20-30 mil (which you can make by running a single haven) it's often more work than its worth
---
Still that doesn't mean that I should just keep losing them. Also I'm an Alpha player who has spent nothing on this game.
---
I miss hearing you in Theta comms Nolak.  Unfortunately, you're pegged as an accomplice with your in game financial transactions with an RMTer.  I imagine there is an isk limit where CCP draws the line.  And evidently your transactions exceeded that limit.  
---
If you had loaned money to someone in Goons and they RMT'd, you would have been banned when they we're caught.  Unfortunately, being an accomplice, whether knowing or unknowingly, makes you guilty by association.  It sucks, but that's how it is.  CCP has zero tolerance.  They can't see what your intentions were in lending money, but they can see your transactions.
---
I wish you luck Nolak.  But it looks like your Eve hobby is over. 
---
It would be pretty interesting to see EVE played completely through the console.
---
Pretty sure this doesn't matter anymore except for having some redundancy
---
A recent-gen i5 is more than enough for eve
---
nice!, I did a similar thing with my "indestructible" gila until it died when I entered the proving grounds  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/73636820/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73636820/) 
---
Fixed it! Just deleted my log in cookies and it fixed the problem!
---
Gotg is a poor example. They annoyed their enemies and screwed their allies, all while having pretty trash defenses, but again. The goon super fleet is in delve. Theyve had months without us to rebuild. Afaik PH isnt attacking them anymore. They can use vertical farming to rebuild, but thatd require they undock and actually play eve. The powers of the north are far to focused and dependent on "passive income" taxs, PI, etc. And not enough on active income, and they wonder why the south is flying circles around them.
---
Hardem the fuck up dumbass shouldn't of rmted
---
Of course it doesn't make sense to you, you don't spend your 'isk making' time ratting/mining in null sec. There won't be PVE capital losses if they keep nerfing capitals ability to rat, because people just won't do it. You'll end up looking at a sea of AFK VNIs that pay for themselves in an hour of ratting. 
---
You keep talking about 'vertical scaling', however multiboxing rorqs is actually horizontal scaling. You don't fix this by nerfing rorq mining amounts, you fix this by increasing their drone speed, and changing the belts to be TONS of little tiny rocks. This will make the activity require effort, instead of afk on the huge spod rock.
---
&gt;I did ask if I'm safe in high sec
---
you're never truly safe, but bounties don't add any risk to your well being.
---
Imperium had an ad.
---
No it's definitely not more work than its worth. Because i also stick it to the people who gouge locally for more profit. It's cheaper the materials are more readily available yet they charge more for it. 
---
It should be cheaper than hisec because of all of this and you should be able to make profit exporting to hisec not importing. There is a reason why very large wormhole connections get plugged with freighters as soon as they are discovered. Because of the endless human greed that makes it so that its profitable to import from hisec.
---
I would see why you would think that it's some kind of false economy if you don't understand how to safely operate in hisec. But we haven't all spent so long multiboxing rorquals in null that we've forgotten how to play in hisec. Fun fact down here in catch we have a jump bridge to hisec so daytripping over there isn't very difficult at all.
---
You realize most of Forbes (and Huff Post for that matter) are just opinion writers, right? Linking an article from a website doesn't provide the authority or creditibility I think you're assuming it does...
---
What editing software do you use? And if it's not free, what would be suggestions for free softwares?
---
grrgon
---
Sure. 100% cash would have more immediate value than 100% stock, depending on terms of course. Pretty important information, but also only an example. There are a lot of details you don't have a clue about so your assumptions and guesswork, passed off as knowledge and experience, means absolutely jack squat.
---
They have to be careful though, Daddy’s Test isn’t too far away 
---
Bring back republicov
---
Also forgot the addition of citadels making them much much easier to stage/protect and removed the need for a sitter in many cases
---
&gt; There won't be PVE capital losses if they keep nerfing capitals ability to rat, because people just won't do it. 
---
I agree. I think yield or isk/hr nerfs are stupid. I think changes should be done so these ships die more often, not earn less money. You see, there is no one way to nerf capitals. And I actually argued against the yield nerfs and other Rorqual changes for example, in my initial post.

I often agree with you as you can see. I was just pointing out that sometimes you make threads just to make threads and repeat simple points you already "won".
---
I don't need to like the way you sometimes present your points, especially so if I often agree
---
Some unnecessary gatekeeping bullshit, blow your brains out if you think you actually can enforce that kind of scummy behavior
---

---
Bullshit, CCP fixed this it can't be broken!@!!
---
I don't think I'm assuming any level of authority other than an opinion from a business magazine.
---
&gt; It's too illustrate the false economy of 'cheaper' ships which require a risky move to secure
---
I usually think of low/hisec prices as the baseline prices but null market as a safety markup.
---
I know, I bought 1 8gb because I knew I wanted to upgrade to 16. So I didn’t have to buy 4x4
---
I don't really do the impass mining thing... I'm a Catch Standing guy. Yea if you're bulk importing maybe it's worth with DSTs... The highsec JB is pretty much always down ( I'm AU / early EU TZ ) so I don't consider that a viable route. If I have to move stuff, it's through a WH or Provi - both are more risky than its generally worth of your moving small numbers of fitted ships...
---
Ah the memories...
---
Absolutely devilish
---
Can you provide the fit in EFT format? Kind of a pain to recreate it from the video description.
---
You still haven't explained to me how that relates to the financial pressure felt inside the company after the sale. You seem to be claiming that some form of cash or stock mix is going to make CCP's road easier than I described, post sale.
---
Fair enough. 
---
But you see if I don't include the stuff I include, there are hundreds of Goon reddit warriors to refute those holes that I don't fill. So it's a trade off between dealing with them in comments (which leads to toxicity and unwanted negativeness), or dealing with them in the initial post (which makes it long).
---
Probably right around the end of the timers tomorrow.
---
I've always wondered about this. What the fuck does TNT actually do? What have they accomplished? I can't even recall something significant they've done, it's almost like they're an alt corp in alliance form.
---
I assumed it based around the fact I then got to observe those NMs for a bunch of incursion sites afterwards and on separate days. But sure, the one bit of concrete evidence was an 'assumption'
---
What would you say to making someone who has been wardecced ie NOT the aggressor, that the wardec fee also pays off the police and concord from going after them for sec status?  It sucks to eat tags every time we want to go to high sec for anything, but actually fighting on some of these wars is painful especially if you eat tags and the next fleet goes to lowsec and shoots stuff, then the next day you go back to high sec.
---
Did you actually name your main Tooniis? 
---
They are all French, they strike for any reason
---
....why have i not done this keybind yet?
---
triglavian are not a player corp/alliance.
---
I bet there is a way to design a CLI capable of that,
---
would be interesting to play
---
This right here. Eve sucks not because carrier fighters can kill frigates but because it fundamentally has shitty mechanics, design, and even a significant lack of mechanics and excuses it away with the word "sandbox."
---
Have you considered docking your pve ship and undocking your pvp ship with friends to fend them off?

This was the best i could do. His fit as he listed it doesn't make sense because with perfect skills you don't have enough cpu for a Pithum B-Type Adaptive Invuln.
---
Wait so Eve now has that thing where the cursor moves  smoothly so it looks all fluid and nice, unlike Google Docs where it’s still static?
---
I've had small (but valuable) stuff moved for ridiculously low prices, like 2m for the entire trip. Yeah, you can get people to move stuff anywhere in HS for almost nothing.
---
Not convinced you actually mean what you're saying now, but "They won't take the proper precautions because they haven't learnt it yet" is not made irrelevant by claiming they need to be taught it by losing a week's progress to game mechanics they're not familiar with. Yes, they will have to learn it eventually, but this isn't teaching them anything other than them wanting to go over to another game. 
---
That’s why no one uses Dodixie. 
---
Yes i have. And often try to. But by the time i'm docked, switched to a travel ceptor, travel to where my ships are staged, switched into a combat ship and warping to someone the hostiles are dead or gone. So either i dock up until the hostiles are dead/gone or i sit on the undock in a combat ship making no isk waiting for hostiles to appear.
---
it depends on the CAS latency-timings-delay of the RAM sticks, these have to match, some BIOS allow you to modify these values but you'll probably have to underclock one of the sticks... also the frequency of the RAM can be mis-matched, however the motherboard will underclock the fastest one... So make sure you check that you buy the right type of RAM and most of the time it goes well
---
It's not uncommon for Goons to shower new players in ISK and free stuff, it happens quite often.

Cant simulate it atm but are there meta flux coils that require less cpu perhaps?

I know a few people who used to roll around in cloaky recons that would do absolutely nothing but try to find C5 tinker rattlesnakes and nestor's so that he could decloak and jam them for long enough for them to die to the site.
---
this is beyond bad posting
---
&gt; So if your friend IRL gives you $20 because you need it then it's cool for the cops to arrest you because, as it turns out, that $20 was stolen?
---
yes, that is actually what happens. not over $20, but I would not accept a brick of cash from some sketchy associate that I suspected was a criminal.
---
&gt; In this situation, you would get an opportunity to prove your innocence.
---
eve accounts don't matter, nobody gets a trial over banning. CCP doesn't have the power of the court to prevent people from lying so proof of innocence is very difficult.
---
StainGuy please don't put yourself on Eve billboards. We need that gate.

Many alliances peeps do this too. They just don't also run expansive loan operations and partner with other loan providers in their business arrangements.
---
yes black ops with higgs reach  like 300mil. so yes it will fit. especially marshal he has perfect 150mil :D
---
buf triglavians, make their weapon  system wide
---
Not much more I can tell. Just repeating advice I saw given about cactus on another Eve sub I read earlier today, presumably by someone who knows him a lot better than I do
---
yes "paye" capacitor flux coil
---
sounds like you need a loan for a texas space lawyer :P
---
CCP has a track record of banning first then asking questions later. If your story is true I hope you get it sorted soon.
---
Not logging in doesnt count either. But it does prevent you getting dropped on. The perfect counter, according to you(?).
---
the loaning thing is quite trusted when you add a collaterall for your loan
---
Gobbins' has bent the knee! The beanstar has been relocated and horde has retreated from O-VWPB. Gobbins and horde ran all the way to BWF-ZZ leaving Xenuria to claim O-VWPB. 
---
that 100b transaction was done before azathio was banned for rmt. how could nolak have known about the rmt before then? from what i understand nolak took that 100b loan from azathio in good faith.
---
From an outside perspective, yes the game does look 'boring'. A lot of the excitement comes from the context of whats happening, rather than the act itself.
---
If you've been hunting a dude for an hour, have almost caught him multiple times, but are able to get him on the last relic site, it doesn't matter that you simply pressed two buttons. The excitement is the adrenaline from what it took to get there.
---
If you're looking for Michael Bay in space, EvE is not for you. What EvE does best is build stories between you and other players that create the excitement and enjoyment, regardless of the appearance or UI.
---
That's just their specific style. The artist (Jakob Falkenberg) who made the Triglavian suits also did the survival suits, new empire jackets, drifter design, and likely most of the cosmetics over the last two or so years.

---
I probably have my time zones mixed up. Doesn't downtime happen at mid AU? And early EU would be towards the end of AU? I'm US so i'ts kinda murky to me (i just keep odd hours that puts me up and on around DT.)
---
I'm sorry, but refusing to cheat is not handicapping myself, it is called having integrity. Something you obviously know nothing about.  One day you will become an adult and value such things.  Maybe.  Probably not.
---
What if I put him on the billboard?
---
Cheap to build  - bad
---
Skill injectors - worse thing ccp did
---
Every alliance now requires one - the meta OK
---
can we make a RL billboard for you?
---
Yea DT is like 10pm Sydney, which is mid-day for me, but I usually log in because I know we need the numbers at the time. 
---
so essentially it boils down to press f1 and wait for death, but there is a heart beating intensity that everyone gets that videos dont convey
---
bots and skill injectors
---
That is absolutely not what I said. I'm saying a cash sale would have been easier to sell to shareholders than an all stock sale, regardless of the profitability of the company pre-sale.
---
Don't worry...it took me 2 years to realize I can CTRL+Spacebar to stop my ship instead of pressing the stop button on ship controls.

Chasing off the ravens was great, i was sad when we took our feroxes out the next day but they brought a phoenix and huge escalation we couldn't handle :(
---
OK, that statement is true. But, you started this a rejection of my assertion of how this is working. So, are you saying CCP's revenue has been doing great and the cash offer for control of the company was just too hard to pass up? Because that was just a setup for the gist of what I'm saying, which is: being an acquisition is tough sledding and often things are done to squeeze blood from the turnip that are not in the interests of long-term health of the acquired company. 
---
I’ll give you all the plex it gives right back to you, space rich and don’t need it. You can also ask me questions and I won’t make fun of you. Goon, but not scamming!
---
How many swastikas do you have?  
---
Nobody cares.
---
You can, just click "hide"
---
Based on previous cases I think there's a good chance that when the security team catches a big RMTer (top half of your graphic, like IWI or Azathio), they nuke anything on either side of the taint line. Often this happens regardless of whether you had a good explanation for your interactions with the guy. 
---
There's also a weird tendency to hit people for "isk selling" when they clearly acquired more isk as a result of their dealings with a known isk seller. At the very least, getting tons of money from Azathio should mark you as an isk *buyer*, not a seller, and buyers don't get perma'd on the first offense. 
---
Evidently the leader of pandemic horde cares... 
---
Radium Shady stood his ground. I trust the man more now.
---
I've never input broadcast any actions that would violate the EULA. It's very easy to rapidly switch clients and F1 fast enough to have multiple guns fire on the same tick. 
---
Yeah I still follow your antics on zkb. 
---
I think there's something wrong with the game, when I can't even  drunkenly wardec other corps in our coalition for giggles unless I anchor a structure. 
---
&gt; FWIW fatigueless jump gates are OP and even Goon CSM admits it. 
---
Except they aren't, mobility INCREASES content. This is the point I'm trying to make. Back in the day entire super cap fleets could cross the universe in a few minutes. This allowed the possibility that your ratting titan/super could get dropped by anyone at any time. Adding in Fatigue, decreasing jump ranges, these changes mitigate risk. It was these changes that allow the 'super capital umbrella' to exist in the first place.
---
And many were 0% collateral. 
---
That 100b was from before it was known to me he was an RMTer, and as I said I returned the 100b because I do not condone RMTing. 
---
Can you really trust somebody who dosn't pay their dept? 
---
I agree, that band-aid was pretty cheap. lol
---
dont fly what you cant afford to lose
---
Jesus Christ. No. I was using it as an example of an important detail that you or I don't even know. The point is that we have no idea how well or poorly CCP's revenue has been. Maybe the shareholders were perfectly happy with the revenue and profit but just couldn't pass up a $420m offer. There is a lot we don't know. We know basically nothing. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying you're passing a bunch of assumptions and guesses as fact.
---
&gt; Except they aren't, mobility INCREASES content.
---
Not necessarily true. 
---
Offensive mobility increases content. Defensive mobility blocks content. Umbrellas are the epitome of defensive mobility.
---
Hur dur what do you mean you don't know how the game works after one day
---
Glad to See xenuria still plays
---
Buddy, you were caught for RMT and got banned. Whining on Reddit won't help you, 
---
Start a new toon. 
---
It is interesting the alliance that call themselves "lowlife" are near the bottom
---
Most of the support team is actually great, the security team is an impenetrable fortress though. This isn't to say they're bad at their jobs, but it's incredibly frustrating to never be able to get in touch with anyone (or at least never get a response on any message, ever) and it's pretty frightening to know you could be hard banned and never have a chance to even protest your innocence. 
---
Support for account hacks is also pretty meh, it can take 6 weeks and they often won't give you any items/isk back. 
---
Debt. 
---
This is a gameplay type that is apart of eve, accept it and move on, was with spatial and public enemy and all the rest, it’s our content, When I pop a new player I give him some isk and tell him what so do differently, when I pop a vet it reminds him that anywhere in eve it can be a dangerous place, I respect other gameplay choices, respect ours

I also still play Titanfall 1 &amp; 2, even with the hackers I still win. If a game you play is really fun but also easy for you to win, why would you give up? 
---
Not possible. I have 3 accounts created 11 months ago that didn't get any SP. All the chat problems were fixed last March. 
---
if they're wardecced that means they joined a corp you dumbfuck. they should stay in an npc corp until they've learnt the basic mechanics and then once in a corp, ask them how not to die.
---
&gt;Not necessarily true.  
---
&gt;Offensive mobility increases content. Defensive mobility blocks content. Umbrellas are the epitome of defensive mobility.
---
Incorrect. Every fight requires 2 parties, if one party can't get there, no fight. The more you 'shrink' the umbrella range, the more you remove the ability for those umbrellas to cross paths. 
---
Example: Today if you say, bridge a bunch of bombers onto a mining rorq, the response you get is 50 haw titans being dropped on your face. Why? Because we know all other threat locations are out of response range.
---
If instead those other threats could appear at any moment, our go-to response would not be 50 titans, because others have the ABILITY to engage them. If you want capitals dying, you have to let them off the leash.
---
At least Rens almost has decent prices.
---
Sounds easy enough for new players to magically know this being new and all.
---
Ship I 1 shot didn't aggro me XDDD
---
The single phoenix is fine, it's the 16+ dreads they have ready in D-G that are the problem... And the supers if it's right before dt when CCP can evac them
---
&gt; The more you 'shrink' the umbrella range, the more you remove the ability for those umbrellas to cross paths.
---
When umbrella drops there is no fight. The defender side of the fight is already present in the form of farming capitals. Umbrella is just an extra cockblocker. It actually discourages people from coming to that space.
---
Umbrella just is a really lazy way of defending to one's space which nullseccer's should stop feeling entitled.
---

I remember my first Thorax,
---
It was the most insanely expensive ship I had ever owned. It cost so much money [the innocence of youth in EVE] that I actually took the trouble of giving it the best fit I could fly with the skills I had at the time [we’re talking a decade ago].
---
It was dead in 20 minutes :-).
---
Correct. No one like it. 
---
People gave less of a fuck when you couldn't bet over it anymore. Made it a hell of a lot less exciting when there is nothing at stake for the viewer. 
---
&gt;When umbrella drops there is no fight. The defender side of the fight is already present in the form of farming capitals. Umbrella is just an extra cockblocker. It actually discourages people from coming to that space.  
---
&gt;Umbrella just is a really lazy way of defending to one's space which nullseccer's should stop feeling entitled. You can use bridged supcaps. You can use gates or player gates. You can use all kinds of stuff if umbrella is slightly nerfed (in the form of a mobile inhibition buff).
---
There is no way to nerf defender mobility, without nerfing attacker mobility as well. Things in general need to be MORE mobile, not less. How are you not understanding this.
---
Aghh! So many commas, so few full stops. It hurts!
---
I don't know which is more pathetic, that you think we moved staging because of you or that you'd be proud of the idea that you managed to shit up O-V local so much for a year that we'd move staging to get away from it.
---
&gt; There is no way to nerf defender mobility
---
Mobile cyno inhib revamp does it pretty good.

if they're getting wardecced, they're in a corp who they could ask. just because your corp sucks monkey balls doesnt mean all of them do

How can anyone be so oblivious that your partner was RMTing and you didn't know? Anyways, ignoring the fact that CCP Peligro was your executioner, I feel like CCP probably has probably a fair amount of evidence to take you down with your partner.
---
I mean, just because you aren't aware you committed a crime doesn't mean you actually didn't. 
---
Requiring gun skills to fly a carrier? That's dumb. You do need large gun 5 for dreads though, which does make sense. Maybe add some more drone skills to 5 for carriers. 
---
Joining a Corp is what most newbies do to learn the game idiot. 
---
*4 hours later....*
---
yeah that is exactly the fit
---
I use the storyline flux coils. This fit might even can do tier 5 
---
OK, take it easy, I'm just asking for clarification. But, honestly, I felt it was clear from my post that these are not things that are known with metaphysical certitude. But, this is probably pretty close to accurate. I mean, there was a guy in this thread who was slamming me because everything that I wrote is blatantly obvious to "anyone who knows anything about anything". I feel like I'm going to have a hard time keeping both of you happy at the same time.

---
don't diss the drake!  it and the navy drake won the AT tourny two years ago as an oddball counter to the 8 BC lineups.
---
The actual action is in comms and your head, especially if you run with small gangs. The intensity comes from analyzing whether you can take the fight,  not being sure, and saying fuck it lets do it. Youtube videos are pretty boring, you risk nothing and somebody is just clicking on stuff. When your playing, you're unsure if your ship's coming back and whether your plan will work. Also, the comradery that you build is only second to competitive sports. 
---
Could you imagine if the ships were placed back into space after downtime if they had combat log off timers.
---
I want attention brought to that shit, correct.
---
It should not be tolerated. Make all the hands jokes you want, but shit like that should not be part of our community.

woah there using curse words, this is a christian sub!

As if the eve forums would be a better place to go? At some point we have to deal with our own toxic community members and say there is a line.
---
nano gangs rape ratting bs's and ratting bs's cost to more for a nice fit than a carrier, they also only make marginally more than a vni not even double a vni really, and you have to be there, 
---
a carrier makes more, costs less, has more chance of not dying to a nano gang because the ehp gives you a chance to hustle to defend.

Considering ccp needs new players to get money and this type of gameplay clearly drives new players away from a game that's already hard to pick up it needs to be changed
---
https://youtu.be/CSALQn0u9z4?t=18
---
There has been real life quafe in the past, you could buy it at the official CCP store. Iirc it tasted a bit like 7up from what I've heard.
---
I lived solo in a c4 with c3/c4 static and it was pretty chill. The c3 often connected to kspace making logistics easy, and the c4 was great for solo income. 
---
Traffic was very low, and rolling holes is easy with those mass limits. This was before citadels though. Id do it again, but doing it solo is definitely a significant work load. 
---
What? Test?
---
Yes, we have a discord bot that produces that stuff, and a lot of those phrases look oddly familiar :D
---
U know, goon pets
---
wally?
---
Íf you want them to ignore triglavians you just have to beg them for it, worked for other thigs 
---
Again, throwing out a lesson that's completely true and very familiar to someone who's actually played the game, but still not something you can expect from someone when they don't know the risks involved, nor that this is something they need to be aware of. It's like you're expecting anyone who's playing EVE ever to automatically know the basics of the game, and act accordingly. 
---
You know that xenuria is in GSF and not TEST right?

I don't think downtime tanking is a very nice mechanic, regardless of if we are doing or they are doing it.

My Name is Revere. I'm the head homo of GoomSwangs Sense and Sensibility program and I identify as a Federation Navy Comet. You've probably heard of me, I'm kind of a big deal, but if not please remember my chosen pronouns: Zlatan, Zlatan, Zlatans, Zlatanself.
---
In Sense and Sensibility we like to remind our fellow Gooms that behaviour that would normally be perfectly acceptable on a council estate might be offensive to delicate space princes such as yourself. I want YOU to know that we take this very seriously and action is being taken at the highest level. No one should be forced to read such lurid and offensive prose, you were forced right? How could you not be.
---
I can assure you that once we have the culprit firmly in hand and taken round the back they will be given a vigorous and enthusiastic hammering that makes me gush my sex wee all over his eight inches of throbbing pink jesus.
---
Fly safe, don't tell them where you live.
---
Need an adc for tier 5's, been using a similar fit since the introduction of the abyss sites, havent lost one since
---
1.5 m per jump!?! dude... 100k
---
You have anything to back this up? 
---
Oh hey you guys are those goons who use their comms spies to tuck tail and run any time someone comes to challenge you.
---
ya now that you can make a free account scouting yourself out of hubs should be a no brainer
---
Yes, it’s included in the screenshot of gobbins bending the knee too you, we  agreed you would release it in a joint statement 
---
I definitely havent been away for 8 years, and the last time I did play the drake seemed to perform just fine.  Did they nerf it worse more recently?
---
Dirty Chewbacca 
---
I've been playing it for 9 years 6 of which has been in LS/NS/WH space, it amazes me to this day that stuff like that is still "acceptable" within this community. 
---
Amarr Vict- wait, what?
---
the difference is what these days?
---
The funny part about that kind of people, is they all get at some point ban from the imperium, then they make a shit post on reddit "mimimimimi The Imperium are mean they kicked me for no reason" and you see them join RMT few weeks after that 
---
:o
---
Woo woo rich goon FTW!! 
---
Informative, funny AND newbee friendly (especially with explaining small tricks like how to get through a gatecamp). Wonderful job!
---
Imagine actually believing anyone cares
---
Truly shocking 
---
Oh I think Mal tried that with a few celestisis.
---
Thanks for the multiple celestis Mal!
---
To not be salty, you sure do sound salty.
---
Sounds like its being bought
---
I got out alive, I actually looted on the way out so I made ISK from it. I have nothing to be upset about except this: the game I fell in love with is different now.
---
Space docking
---
Wow some rando complaining about panfam supers.
---
Blast from the past.
---
Sorry not sorry
---
Shit man
---
I know, I'm so glad we missed out on what must have been a very buggy game a year ago.
---
They did the same to a SF fleet ran by an NC FC himself, you really shouldn't be surprised.
---
I needed a bit more, I was close. 
---
Because we didn't have each other's API, didn't monitor each other's wallets, and we didn't really talk all that much. 
---
Haha
---
Why would you go Tribute instead of Catch, Providence or Geminate?
---
Is this post implying that there are women in goons to sexually harass?
---
Okay so there’s no context, is he talking to someone specific? Or are you some butthurt generation 2000 that’s offended by everything?
---
or they could just remove shit mechanics rather than keeping them for the express purpose of milking players for cash
---
at this point, i think you care more about inits deployment than init do.
---
they have a bee logo and we have a dinosaur logo?
---
Assuming you live in a Western country.
---
Go to delve next time. I bet goons will drop subs
---
Go to delve with your npsi fleets, kthx
---
I have a solution to your problem; stop being a little bitch.
---
NPSI goes to Tribute, home of the PANFAM superfleet, and dies. Wow what a shocker. Maybe next time try delve.
---
I’m now under the assumption that your ranging on our deal, I have to choice but to take you prisoner and keep you in geminate, To goons, if you want your “very important” pilot back it’s now 100 exotic dancers
---
Take a similar fleet to Delve and report back on how it went.
---
State ravens for $500 😂
---
And how would they do this without breaking the EULA?
---
You seem to be new to the game..
---
The fact that a single ship can tank that much is why I hate caps.
---
Haha, look at those retards PvPing! Don't they know that EVE is an empire building RTS?
---
which part of the EULA forbids multiple accounts?
---
Its kinda sad I cant tell if you are joking or that you really feel this makes a good reddit meme.
---
1) don't cherry pick sites
---
2) repeat step one... forever
---
shes starting shimmie!
---
Lmfao
---
Honestly, I never unsubbed, just switched to skill training online. 
---
Except.... now owned by a Korean company, profit and increasing subscription counts are the priority. You're noticed it in the changes to the game. I guarantee they have a long term plan that gradually phases out the hard core for more loot boxes and easy, just joined player retention updates. Every month there is a meeting there, "how can we get more subscribers to join and stay?"
---
Feels like a rewind! How long until people complain that they can't use caps without the mythical N(CCP)L super fleet showing up within 15 min?
---
I played the game for 7-8 years and probably flew frigates, cruisers, or battlecruisers over 95% of the time. 
---
Just think about real-life pirates: are they cruising around in nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers, or zodiacs and speedboats? Right, they pick the ships that are low-profile, bad targets, cheap to lose, but that can be used to capture or destroy high-value targets.
---
I know it seems daunting but the actual loss in the game is the single greatest aspect of Eve. Obviously, losing your shit feels bad (and it should, at least a little, this will drive you to be better) but beating someone and knowing  they can't just 'respawn', is a rush that very few games have
---
I’ve realized and it’s depressing lol 
---
You didn't include:

Bad meme but I'd absolutely fly a super carrier sized punisher
---
You said free accounts. And while yes you can have as many free accounts as you like. You are not permitted to multibox with them.
---
LOOL
---
Total ignorance on display
---
I have a friend whom I'd love to see argue with Xenuria.
---
When an unstoppable force meets an immovable obstacle...
---
EVE isn't about action, really. It's more similar in terms of the 'battle adrenaline' to something like an RTS (especially if you're a fleet commander) than an action game. It has some simulator-like elements. It's.. really hard to describe, man. The TL;DR of it is that it's kind of like real warfare, to the extent that a game can be: long hours of intense boredom and monotonous work, with intermittent short bursts of intense fighting, but the fighting is not always enjoyable. It's a game almost exclusively catered to people with long time horizons, who want to accomplish long term goals and put up with a lot of not so fun minute-to-minute gameplay especially when you first start, in order to get some of the most interesting and memorable moments you'll ever have in gaming.
---
Gate keeping fucktard
---
Also in Goonswarm
---
Nothing surprising here.
---
Grr goons, grr pvp. Okay dude, 
---
i didnt know you couldnt have multiple alphas logged in at once, interesting.
---
can you have an omega + an alpha logged in at the same time?
---
i guess your other option is to scout while your main is logged off but that still leaves you vunerable
---
To be fair they needed a win today.
---
[O1-FTD](/spoiler)
---
New players come in and older players leave.. I just don’t want the game I know to be bastardized. 
---
&gt;O1-FTD&lt;
---
Frigs and dessies of the various different styles (T1, pirate, navy, assault frigate, tactical destroyer, interceptor, command destroyer, interdictor, stealth bomber, EWAR frigates) are the most used ships in the game, I think. Either they are, or cruisers and their variants. Either way, these are far from inadequate and many of the most veteran players of the game fly them more than anything else, myself included. This is because speed, warp and align time, and signature radius are so important in this game to prevent dying horribly :)  
---
Also, the fact that anything can die, permanently, means that people don't just always fly their biggest ships. Unless they're super cocky, but if they miscalculate, it leads to some hilarious opportunities to kill their shinies :)
---
Try to contact a large Bloc FC to arrange a fair fight (even though you don't tell your fleet members)..
---
You have encountered a Thorax! What would you like to do?
---
&gt; Warp
---
You failed to warp. The Thorax has you pointed! What would you like to do?
---
Or the fleet mode:
---
FC has called PVPGodMaster420 primary! What would you like to do?
---
&gt; F1
---
The ship explodes! FC has called RectumShouldHaveKilledEm primary! What would you like to do?
---
&gt;F1
---
Is this guy british by any chance?
---
Unless you fit all smartbombs on a throwaway BS and then MJD right into the middle of a frigate / destroyer gang. Then you just scream like Goku going SSJ3 and watch the mails roll in.
---
CCP improves game
---
r/Eve runs low on things to bitch about
---
OP is the result
---
&gt; and we didn't really talk all that much.
---
&gt;We’d joke about crazy requests, boast about our newest acquisitions (I collected legacy ships), or just talk about the latest shitpost on Reddit. After a while we decided to unofficially partner up, and lend each other ISK to take loans if we were a bit short.
---
choose.
---
Fitting name
---
I highly recommend getting some friends who like to fly cheap effective stuff in small gang. It's really fun, cheap and you always look good when you kill shinies in cheaper stuff. EVE is a game where exponential price increases lead to marginal, linear improvements. More money does not lead to that much of a better ship considering all the other variables at play, and the cost of small upgrades. You can do a lot of damage with a small group of people in Thrashers, Cormorants, Algoses, Caracals, etc. You can take a lot of fights in a short amount of time in a small gang of assault frigates and limp away if you do well, even if you lose. I highly recommend exploring the variants of small ships out there. They can be quite mean and very satisfying.
---
Go south, lets see how it goes there, lol.
---
If you can bling it just don't use a Drake 
---
Good news, OP. He’s been purged for violating the Alliance’s rule against posting heterosexual propaganda. Hope this helps. 
---
You think the NC FC wasn't leaking intel on the whole thing? lol?
---
I've made alts that have enough time, and skills that would seem harmless to anyone, but with enough to join any corp as "not quite new player".  No association with my main or any of my contacts what so ever.
---
This would have happened literally anywhere else you went less you set up a fight.  Delve does this, Esoteria, Dek, any where there are supers in large numbers.  Yes the game has changed and I'd love if folks shipped into similar stuff as well, but like RL instead of what you'd like you get a kick in the balls.
---
small if true
---
Corebloodbrothers will always be my one true love.
---
that is a massive change in the gameplay mechanics and definitly not how I was picturing it,
---
If you think about it, everything in Eve can be acheived without any graphic view, you just need the many menus and lists the UI provides, and all of these could be easily recreated through CLI (and I mean not seeing them one at a time, you can have these all on screen)
---
the only problem with it is that you cannot really estimate the relative distance from a ship to another , you only know the distance from your ship to these two ships
---
CCP use to sell real quafe in their online store. If i remember correctly it tasted like Ramune. I purchased some back in 2005/2006 era.
---
lol haha look at those losers playing a game, look at them, they cant even stop me from looking at a rock for the next 20 hours lol haha lol losers haha lol
---
Usually if you deploy it's because you want to achieve something
---
Might do higher-res stuff in future that could be suitable for printing. Wouldn’t sell prints though because that’d cross a line in terms of making a profit off CCP’s IP.
---
[Awww yeah](https://youtu.be/8UwDT7MDD0I)!
---
HOTKEYS!
---
I'm not saying it and trying to make a conspiracy theory of it just saying that if they're willing to drop titans + supers on a fleet ran by an NC FC (and it was promoted as such) that it shouldn't be a surprise they'll drop on a random fleet
---
fuck you retard
---
Do you even hotkey bro?
---
&gt; can you have an omega + an alpha logged in at the same time?
---
No. If you have an Alpha logged in you cannot have any other accounts logged in at the same time. 
---
"pvp"
---
my advice, next time bring them to Horde space.   no super cap umbrella.   far more players.  and more likely to get a fleet response, double so as you can spy on them with ease, and see where they coming form, in, and that they noticed you to start with
---
I'm still waiting to show up on someone's youtube channel after I wreck them.  I'm starting to think that would never make it anyways. 
---
ah right on
---
so probably best solution is to use an out of corp alpha to scout your friends out and vice versa or like i said log in check the gate log out log in omega and so on
---
second option is tedius and dangerous so probably best to just get a friend to help out
---
I will. If you got dropped by NC. while being FC'd by an NC. FC, it was 100% intentional. 
---
Tackle is also very important in a few weeks you can fly dictors and prevent entire fleets from escaping the slaughterhouse
---
Guys I found Quark the Ferengi right here with this response
---
nice drift
---
hi mate, on of the biggest values an fc has is knowing his targets, that includes regions, you would get a fantastic brawl in geminate(horde) providence(cva) pureblind(all the crazy locals) or catch(brave) you chose to go to the second most supercapital heavy region in the game after delve, tribute. There are dead areas (dronelands/tenal whatever) that you wont get a fight, there are gtfo our space areas (tribute/delve/esoteria maybe deklein).
---
Of course Brisc rounds up.
---
Never ever have all of your stuff in one area (don't put all your eggs in one basket) because if shit happens and you have ALL of your stuff in one area then you're pretty fucked. Put some stuff in hs or ls if wars are always an issue.
---
AoE DDs were a mistake
---
shitpost
---
Usually, I respect the deploying side a lot more. Even or especially if they don't smash their enemy outright but result in fairly even fights. It takes guts and dedication to deploy out of your home.   
---
The offensive side is actually making something happen and taking most of the risk. Economic risk by importing all the resources/ships, asset risk by deploying structures in enemy space and strategic risk by possibly bringing their (capital) fleet into enemy space etc. etc.  
---
Did...did you honestly think Eve was a safe haven from all the stuff you find everywhere else? There's a reason why the players of Eve are feared (or loved) by many.
---
this br is a mess.
---
Who got harassed tho? Sounds like they had fun
---
Griffin. 
---
I don't care if a cap, super, or other blingy ship is gonna pop I will burn to a Griffin and remove it from space even if it kills me.
---
I know this guy he used to be in cyno.Up for a short time.
---
OP, if you're looking for a random good fight without supers, go to Geminate (and don't bring goons with you, like you apparently did here).
---
quote: "I'm not salty" 
---
Well this certainly adds some momentum to u/meowtiger 's assertions that bringing "engageable" fleets gets fun fights from his crew.
---
Talked to receg
---
Friggin stainguy...
---
You mean begging me for isk ?
---
We talked maybe once a week or so. We'd talk for a while on Discord in a single session, and then not speak for a few days. 
---
1)Undock kikimora
---
2)Run from titan fleet
---
3)Fun achieved
---
So just pay for omega? I don’t get it 
---
Bear in mind that my experience with them is in mission running so your millage may vary. It's not that the Drake got further nerfs, it's just that other ships outperform the Drake.
---
The Drake is known for being a brick-tanked missile ship. Using HMLs its better to use their range to minimise incoming dps. HMLs are slow to apply damage at range, especially compared to drones, rails or lasers, and as such you face more incoming dps. So you have to beef up your tank to deal with it. A bigger shield tank means a bigger signature radius, which means more incoming dps for less damage application. 
---
Up close the Drake has HAMs with their bigger paper dps. The trouble is, Hams need more slots to apply dps which means less fitting room for tank, and the damage is still applied slower than drones, blasters, autocannons or lasers.
---
Tldr: every race, including Caldari, have at least 1 ship that out-Drakes the Drake in comparable PvE situations. 
---
Hi spyler, how is horde treating you?
---
This one time I popped some streamers Garmur with my Thrasher, Someone linked the stream and oh boy he was not amused. I went to say GF, but he was all like "Yeah I would have rekt you but I misclicked and warped to the belt at zero" I wanted to argue that it wouldn't have mattered because he warped into my bubble, but I was banned from the chat, lmao.
---
There were 3 Naglfars and over a dozen Drake Navy issues shooting at this Phoenix 
---
Also, if you want to do non pvp stuff to start, look into joining Signal Cartel. They’ll get you set up with exploration frigs and plenty of advice. 
---
I've played for 10 years this March. If I was faced with this as a new player back in 2009 I would not have lasted. Eve is run by its communities. When people don't play because of stupid war mechanics, it works against one of the most important things as a new player. 
---
Step one get job, step two buy omega,....
---
People who want to fly Drakes and live near Jita. 
---
How old is this footage? o.O Shekel's last kill was 6 months ago.
---
You check the mining ledger to see what people have mined.
---
You're not wrong, and if they're just doing it for gudfites then props to them. 
---
Once it is popped, all moons throughout New Eden are free for all.  Many Null alliances charge folks for using it, but that is because they can shoot you. High sec guys are screwed in that regard.
---
Ha ha yeah it's pretty much exactly that old.
---
So, I came across [this](https://www.eveonline.com/article/exploit-bumping-in-order-to-prevent-e-warp) (CCP declaring bumping during emergency warp after a safe logoff an exploit) and I have a couple of questions.
---
Out of curiosity, I tried to replicate it on the test server. I used a supercarrier, with a 30sec align time, and it seems that the supercarrier upon login is already in warp, it definitely didn't take 30 whole seconds to initiate warp, including black screen while the client was loading. So I was wondering how the SC pulled the titan [kill](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1rllwu/dt_titan_down/) by exploiting this mechanic. Did CCP change something regarding the ewarp mechanics or am I doing something wrong (which is the most likely scenario by far :P)?
---
And a second question. If probing down the random spawn point of a super upon login after a safe logoff is indeed possible, would bubbles work in null or are they considered an exploit too? Cause there were some old [responses](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=1335076#post1335076) by CCP devs that this is working as intended, but that was before declaring the bump after a safe logoff an exploit.
---
at least their doing something. better than lying down face first basting in their own crab juices.
---
Can you really shit up O-V local when everyone in O-V local had him blocked?
---
Your brother/sister/relative can scout you on their alpha though 
---
So what's the new caldari Drake?
---
Lol ever been to org in wow  it lol if you think it’s impossible 
---
Also output the angle of each ship vs. the system's star from your position. With some practice, one might get good at knowing when an angle means it's "in front" or "left" or whatever, and by figuring that out for multiple ships one could get a sense of each ship's position. For example, two ships have the same angle but different distances, one is behind the other in the same direction. If they're the same distance but one is -10 degrees and the other 50 degrees, you have an even triangle and thus they're the same distance from each other as they are from you. Obviously other situations would be more complicated, but having an idea of how it works would be a start. You don't need to break out the pythagorean theorem, just get good at rough estimates.
---
Didn't they deploy to a wormhole and fail horribly?
---
Why did you go to Tribute expecting a fair fight?  There are a few regions that most know are locked down with the supercap umbrella and won't give you a fair fight by design.  Tribute, Delve, Esoteria, Deklein, and a few others are among them.  These regions are "off limits" so to speak and any entrance is going to get you dropped on at some point.
---
yeah true! good point
---
I don't dislike my family enough to get them in to EVE.
---
You know when the Imperium will deploy north and will use cap/super against northern subcapI will use your post as a reminder of how hypocrite you guys are ?
---
Dont tell me... youre part of Violente Fortuna arent you?
---
Imagine being such a loser that you have to virtue signal on a video game subreddit. Boo hoo words hurt my fee fees
---
Still have my vial of [Vitoc](https://i.imgur.com/pBngj9v.jpg)
---
I'm a naughty minmatar...
---
Try not going to the home of the second strongest superfleet if you don’t want said superfleet dropped on you
---
yeah, its nothing vs EVE
---
tell me when you are rending over 500 people on screen at once
---
now do 4000
---
Yes because the average RMT transaction is 50m isk and some t1 frigates lmao how are you this dumb?
---
I think I am going to start recording some of my PVP hunting trips to put on Youtube.  Just for proof.  LOL
---
I'm not sure I can fly in a typhoon anymore and not feel dirty somehow.  
---
You can't be serious. If words on a screen hurt your feelings so much, you have serious mental issues and should probably be dealing with them rather than playing a video game. It's manchildren like you that are pushing this modern era of rampant censorship.
---
Then play eve more for 1b and more isk. Duh.
---
&gt; Or are you some butthurt generation 2000 that’s offended by everything? 
---
Ding ding
---
Lol the game blends to just limit systems these ball wars are just dumb. 
---
I remember chatting with you in Karmafleet public. Fun times until your meltdown. Hope horde's treating you well
---
I was never in Karmafleet though... and yea Horde is good :)
---
There used to be quafe irl. It was pretty simple, a rebrand of a somewhat obscure Icelandic energy drink called Orka, you can get some of that if you want to know what it tasted like but it was somewhat similar to 7up, I liked it tbh though I only ever tried it once.
---
Suffice to say their distribution methods were flawed and it did not sell very well so it was shitcanned. The main issue if they did bring it back would be finding a company to get them onto shelves.
---
Wait, you actually WANT to pay more money for something that gives no extra content or artwork but instead just speeds up a timer?  
---
You should try some of those shitty mobile games if you enjoy that.
---
Props to them regardless for the content that they bring.
---
Did anyone in the NPS fleet record this with comms? Mail me for r
---
That shit was tasty as hell but same expensive to get shipped to the uk
---
This is that Cancer that has eaten away at Eve. Super by Super by Titan by Titan. Bitter vet by bitter vet, Injector by injector.
---
I personally wouldn’t have any objection to it if it gets more groups coming into highsec to fight. I’m not sure how CCP would want to do it though since they like that penalty. 
---
I wear huge douchey shades because it helps me feather 
---
You can only check whom mined your moongoo through ledger and ask them to pay the bill
---
As opposed the Tri approach of 1)Undock titan fleet 2)Lose titan fleet 3)Move to Pure Blind?
---
let us buy npc stations as skins off the store or hell just let us build them instead of the same 7 player ones
---
if you want to limit, go wormholes.
---
don't remove something cause YOU don't like it.  others do.
---
I think the total fit + pod cost like 7 or 8 bil at the time. It better tank a lot. 
---
as a proud goonswarm member, I always wear my bee kigurumi in fleet
---
they got the record for shortest deployment from test, thats something i guess
---
This will age well, I can feel it.
---
Thanks for spoiling the surprise, *jerk*
---
Nah even if you are a nerd, you are a cool nerd
---
If they're afk for a while they'd probably notice they were kicked from corp immediately after becoming active again? Your reasoning makes zero sense.
