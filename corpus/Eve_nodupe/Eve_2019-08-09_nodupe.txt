---
Heron is the best, followed by a tie between the Probe and the Imicus. The magnate's layout makes it so that you have a lot more suvivability, at the expense of actual exploration usefulness... but even when brick-tanked you are liable to be alpha'd out anyway, so it's hardly worth it. 
---
I advice against fitting stabs on your lows, regardless of the ship you choose. Anyone who catches you will asume you are warp-stabbed and try to just kill you before you warp out. Paranoia is the best tank an exploration frig can fit.
---
One million free sp would have been insanity when I started out.

1 Orca, 2 Covetors best setup 3 accounts assuming your boosting skills are good
---
Also, can you not spell the word “To”?
---
Just curious but how many people usually go to these?
---
ASHIMMU
---
for Damage, literally the best glass cannon. (while it isn't the top max potential dmg,  it has the range to USE the dmg)
---
Rag
---
for tank, PvP, and general.
---
Avatar
---
if you want more dmg than avatar in pvp. but you don't really worry about being out of range.  Erebus. (most dps. but again...range)
---
if you like shield. and want to be in one of the tankiest, least killed (though possibly due to least used..but hey its the only one not to die in the BR-5rb.   or was it asakai....one of them..or both?  cant remember).   then Leviathan.
---
in terms of who dies the most.
---
Erebus
---
Rag (surprising...sucks to be erebus)
---
and Leviathan(rarest seen, rarest killed)
---
Seems like a pretty common typo
---
I mean yeah I guess you’re right
---
You mean check the website and then copy paste it into some program... Then write up the details? This is Eve. Not my fucking homework. You guys may love your little programs and spreadsheets but most of us just do the hardcore game and prefer a streamlined approach to PvP. Guess you're the carebear.
---
No it's not, the Damavik just has a better slot layout, allowing 2 neuts.
---
Hey, the Fenrir is worse.... a bloody hauler named after a giant, savage wolf children of Loki.
---
But like also, proofreading exists.
---
It being an easy typo makes it an easy one to catch if you take 30 seconds to reread the one, single paragraph that OP wrote.
---
i tried looking at ship losses for titans and it seems like erebus was the most common one?
---
And people say mining isn't profitable

Good Sax in Stain if you want good NPC space with decent content.

There are entire corporations in TEST who stopped logging in. Looking at you MooseArmy.

---
Wut? Did you actually read their hull bonuses?
---
&gt; PVE? 
---
Lmao just get a super.
---
Everyone will say Avatar because everyone flies an avatar. You will do shit dps because everyone has EM and thermal resists. 
---
Erebus does a ton more damage and its Armor tanked so win?
---
Tracknaroks were a thing untill they got the oof. 
---
If you never want to die get a Levi. DPS is great but for the love of god never use Rapid Torps.
---
1 Orcas (with augmented mining drones + mining drones rigs) + 2 Hulks. Max Orca boost I think is 107%/40%/40%
---
Domi is slow af. But also, depend on fit, way more tanky.
---
I mean it seems like the Ishtar gets the bonus max velocity to heavies. looks like it's better with sents, and swap the armor rep for adcm. So I guess what i'm saying is they look comparable with the ishtar being better, but more expensive. 
---
I'm also not the best with these things lol I could be missing something obvious
---
Buy an Erebus or Avatar if you want a first Titan
---
Minmatar brown long turd for Tokyo drifting

Caldari doesn't have a Titan
---
That's funny, [their killboard stats](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98420562/stats/) suggest that July was their second most active month of all time.
---
Myrmidons are like 50 mil after insurance. Domis are about 100. Ishtars will be a little over 200. And while a domi does get better ticks than a myrm, an Ishtar doesn’t really get better ticks than a domi. So it’s really not worth using at all, at least while blackout is happening

One boosting orca and 2 exhumers of your choice work real well. Put big remote reppers on your orca in even of fools. Your booster pilot also wants the implant for better boost.

Use drones to mine on the orca, assign 2 drones from each miner to defend your orca. Easy.

Abyss loot has fallen a lot in price lately. The real answer is that you have to pay attention to supply and demand, watch what people are doing, and be ready to jump on something when prices start to spike. Other than ore, it might only take a few people farming a particular activity to dramatically change the price.

VNI's can no longer launch 5 heavy drones, the Myrm, Domi and Ishtar all can. That was the nerf in fact.

If you're thinking about resubbing, make sure to consider the state of what you want to do. If you aren't negatively affected, then you're getting back to what you remember. If your activities are negatively affected, make sure you've got backup plans for what you can/want to do.

Less people krabbing I'll grant you but more roaming fleets, more chance to run into other roaming fleets for a good fight. Dunking krabbers is nice to be sure, but the real fun is in enemies that shoot back.

more roaming fleets, good joke. its people running away from each other because engaging is scary lmao. space is straight up empty you can roam for hours without finding anything unless you go to the same maybe 3 areas, at which point you get a gank and then you scarper because if you dont, the cyno goes up. the outer edges of peoples umbrella ranges and smaller alliance space where there wasn't a danger of supers being dropped on you was amazing fun before hand to get subcap fights, now there simply isnt anything there.

So, just to be sure, the free corvette they always give you when you choose the "board my corvette", it's modules are the only ones in the game where you can repair them in space for absolutely free?

&gt;But I don't get it, you can put a bounty on yourself, then collect it when you die? Or I guess you use an alt, kill your alt, your alt puts a massive bounty on yourself... then some idiot (like me) activates it without thinking, alt gets the money, alt transfers the money to primary account ?
---
I did this a few times with freighters. Fill the cargohold with tons and tons and tons of random garbage that isn't easy to visually scan through for valuables and then set it on a very long autopilot route (while AFK ofc) to give them some panic that I might end up actually getting somewhere and being safe.
---
Plenty more difficult now with tools you can copy paste the scan results into.
---
Yes, but we already have rules against that enforced by banning.
---
So we don't need game mechanics based on balancing that problem.
---
A) thats awesome
---
B) Thats why i give all my excess isk to my jita alt and my jita alt keeps all my isk in their corp wallet. I only have above 1 bill on my mains after I sell blue loot or need to buy some new ships.

Personally, I'm not the most active player atm. Most of what keeps me in the game are the friends I've made. If you're not part of a good group of people, it can be agonizing. But even though I'm not super active, I'm still on discord and respond to pings when I can. And the fleets we have are so much damn fun. Hell, if they aren't online, I won't ever undock.

I've found a great group of friends that value friendship over activity. If you're looking for a casual corp that tries to give you some activity everyday, let me know. Come have a chat, see if what we're doing interests you.

The shininess of the killmail is determined by the modules. 
---
I can't speak for everyone, but my mental calculus would go something like this; 
---
&gt;The activation for the KR costs $&lt;x&gt;, and for that I add a $&lt;hull + fit&gt; mail to my killboard, and I get 50% (stochastic average) of $&lt;fit&gt; back via loot drop. Is this worth it for me? What if they're not AFK, or come back soon?

Domi is probably the best choice. If you just throw a couple heavy neuts in the high and an mjd, you basically become a gigantic pain in the arse for 95% of solo hunters. Few solo ships can stand up to the combination of being double heavy neuted AND going into scram range to stop your mjd. 
---
Also they cost like 80 mil after insurance if you scrub fit it.
---
Mines all night and Rats all day ofc....

I might be misremembering and it was the programmer wrote a total million-ish lines, not all of them POS code. But I think it was the POS code.

Yeah I did realise that but it was a little bit hard to arbitrarily draw borders when a region was maybe split in two. Delve did seem to be the vast majority of the industry for the surrounding regions though so i just did this for simplicity. To be honest this video was more for economics nerds rather than eve players who could call me on my shit a little bit better but oh well.

It's not too late! All you have to do is biomass and create a new character!

It *really* depends on the specific question. There are some systems in LowSec that are far more dangerous that your average NullSec system, and there are quite a few LowSec systems that are safer than your average NullSec system. Likewise, there are some systems in NullSec (especially NPC-controlled NullSec) that are very quiet, and as such are mostly safe.
---
It usually just boils down to how much traffic the individual system gets and who lives there.

Put them all in Orcas. Get an Athanor. Leave them on moon rocks for a while. Occasionally come back and check to move your Orca to a new rock.

Use Mining Drone II. James 315 has declared that use of anything more is illegal, so it's a rather bad idea to leave them unattended unless you like your drones being smartbombed.

Is this part of the game source file or some thing?

I too hate the idea of alts. I do have 3 characters on one account for all the passive activities though. Planetary interaction and manufacturing, research, and reaction lines. Alts seems to take away from most of the core aspects. Why fleet up when you can scout or tackle for yourself. Why arrange for security when you can just transfer to a neutral hauler that can move around without the consequences of standings and wars.
---
Same here. I just turned g sync off.
---
Its charlot. You activate a killright thats usually more than their ship price, if they are starting off, its that way, since they dont need any isk to set the KRs price they somehow down the line make (big) profit

It's a lot of work to setup, but you only need to maintain the systems you go to most often, which is usually trade hubs and your normal hunting grounds. This all pays off when you've got the shakes and are trying to find a good warp out without fat fingering it

What did you used to do that made you like the game? If you like the game but can't get excited about anything you either A: Like the idea of the game but not playing it, B: Got bored with what made you like it in the first place or can't find the opportunity to do those things anymore or C: Are stuck in some mindset,  there are many, which is keeping you from changing habits and doing something new and interesting.  
---
This comes up a lot believe it or not. Normally someone gets stuck in their Eve Habits and gets bored but is too scared to jump off the deep end and learn something new. Ever keep a new game you bought and don't play it until you 'want to spend the time' or 'need something to do'? New things are actually very difficult to learn, not because of the learning curve, but the fear of something new and different if you already felt comfortable.  
---
Jokes are made about how difficult EVE is to learn, but it's mostly just BS. Nobody learns everything the game has to offer. Most learn an aspect of the game and get stuck repeating it; it's comfortable, easy to get into again, and satisfying. You sound stuck. Do something radically different.

I totally understand different characters because each character has a history. Maybe alts because you reach a limit, but the simultaneous log ins seems to me game breaking.

Anyone who has watched the rooks and kings video from last fall should be able to see that after a year of getting built up, generating isk, and learning your routines, that they are now ready and able to start competing for control of the server.
---
And tbh, all that 'low iq' play is more likely causing overconfidence. And overconfidence kills more pilots than any other single reason.
---
They also likely have very competent assistance, as a stirring of the Eve pot would be great for the game long term. Everyone blathers about triglavians and drifters, when a genuine human opponent, one from an alien culture with an alien language, is already on your door.
---
Or maybe its just some guys getting lols.

Wordpress is why everyone hates PHP.  There is a whole ecosystem of wordpress hacks that are dogshit PHP.
---
well it's nice to frat posting memes on reddit but damn guys
---
I laughed a lot more than I thought I would at that lol
---
Its far too early for full disclosure, man.
---
T3D's wil run up to 4/10 without problem. 1/10 is the only highsec combat site that they're not allowed to enter.
---
Here's your downvote.
---
Because that would leak the code, making it technically possible for people to look at how to exploit shit and also giving the possibilty of having it easily stolen.
---
Open source is not always a good idea.
---
Eh, they're both lumpy and green, close enough.
---
What the other guy said - it's a very bad idea in a multiplayer game. The odds of someone finding an exploit is nearly 100%, because the Venn diagram between programmers, exploiters and EVE players includes a _lot_ of people.
---
HAMs are better IMO. You can kill bigger things and I fit a neut so that smaller things that are active tanked like hecates will not be able to tank the reduced damage from poor application
---
Get ganked lol
---
People are HAPPY about: 
---
1. Pandemic Horde Titan used lance to kill a bunch of drones... but helped to kill allied HEL instead. (Rated A for Accuracy).
---
2. BLACKOUT RAVE: Le wild CCP closed local chat, making players think and finally use that sexy D-scan button... but that caused an OUTRAGE: Botters quit, Quitters threatening to quit, afk-ratting peasants threatening to quit... but BLOPS, stealth bomber pilots and other smart people that know what a brilliant opportunity it is - returning and resubbing. Also PLEX price finally goes down just like old times (no, drake isn\` t in current meta and dual web talos too).
---
3. Carriers taking nerfbats to the face because some see them as too dangerous opponents for subcaps... They just don\`t know how to cook them.
---
4. Slight nerf of HAW titans, VNI and Gila.
---
5. Eve is dying. 
---
6.  Drifters tired of nullsec shenanigans and randomly attack citadels and players.  About time!
---
7. 64 bit client that promises good stuff... but that spaghetti code though...
---
People are MAD about:  
---
1.  PLEX prices on the rise UNTIL blackout happened (but for how long?).  
---
2.  Blackout (Carebears crying while people with hands growing from correct places still enjoy the game).  
---
3.  Eve is dying.
---
4. Nullsec is still a giant blue ball... with occasional flavor of AWOX and betrayal.
---
5. Balance.
---
6. Hornet EC-300. Silent threat right here.
---
7. That one dude with shield tank in armor fleet.
---
This is awesome. Piloting itself might not be the point, but sometimes having an innovative or just plain different fit is enough to give you an edge. Should not the lack of non-gallente kills though, that says loads about the engagement profile...
---
I thought you pounded your V with thousands of dongs though?
---
Am I the only one who doesn't get this?
---
ONE: If they don't like it they can go no one will miss them (more left ore for us)
---
TWO: They just bluff blackmail (they not going anywhere they addicted4ever)
---
Ok bye mate
---
The killright belongs to an alt of the scorpion. With the insurance money he gets plus the price of the killright, he makes a profit on someone killing him.
---
What veldspar are mining that’s green??
---
Easily one of the most disturbing things I've ever seen
---
veldbrain
---
Can also throw a missile computer and application rigs
---
Rumor has it the Domi was the Dread pilot's alt.
---
Its a lot of hell. a lot of of in this video were multi boxing at least 2 bombers. 4 is enough. Lol
---
In addition to what /u/Lasket said, there's a simple problem with this idea. *Where* is the POS code? It's likely interweaved with other things - ever wonder *why* they have had so weird stuff happen when they so much as poke it and so much trouble removing it?
---
This is not likely a separate file, or even separated functions - but mixed in all sorts of other code, possibly without even sane naming conventions - all of which may make removing it less like amputating a gangrenous limb than removing cancer from someone's *brain.*
---
CCP likely even now doesn't even know where all of it is, or even how it *works.*
---
You can't *just* open source the POS code. You'd need to give all of the game source up.
---
We were spoon fed faxes though so its not that bad.
---
Alcohol is my best friend.
---
I could have sworn it was green, but it's definitely not. I'd blame it on spodbrain but spod isn't green either...
---
ehh spod has some greenish parts, so close enough
---
If you were going to start a large web application from scratch knowing what you know now, what language would you use?
---
Pls stay safe
---
That's also an option, although I usually just go for more tank
---
Nowhere is stay when Rasta is around.
---
Im always safe brother
---
thank you for being concerned for our wayward child in his time of need
---
I honestly feel that, since it was around since his day, this task should be given to Hilmar to correct. Give the man some humility.
---
Praise to Anure, savior of the Wildlands
---
God bless
---
I mean most of these people are giving you good tips. I recommend that you run 3 hulks, max yield fit. Then go ahead and send me an ingame mail of where you'll be. I'll bring Orca boosts.
---
what even is this

Snuffed is to spod brain to understand

POSes don't exist anymore though. "POS code" is just a smokescreen now
---
Don't programmers *actually* get paid by lines? I think I remember that from somewhere
---
He wasnt bait tho, he was solo, we took the fight and he won. And i hope i do get reimbursed l.ao. less isk i have to spend.
---
your character is not you, dude. it's an in-game character that you play.
---
besides, there are a lot more nuances to each faction than you think, every character can be its own kind of asshole. minmatar are just as deep in the shit as any other.
---
It was a combat barge, that’s like, totally bait, and you flew your triangle ass right up on it, got tacked, capped out and died in a swarm of drones.
---
&gt;. but BLOPS, stealth bomber pilots and other smart people that know what a brilliant opportunity it is - returning and resubbing
---
remember my comment down below where I said only risk averse bitches like the current thin meta of cloaky bullshit that wont/cant fight subcaps? well yeah heres more proof lmao
---
I‘m planning on buying a new GPU - currently on a 1050 Ti which can‘t handle higher Abyss Sites on decent graphics(1080p Resolution) . What do you recommend for a single client setup?
---
He said make ISK, not your killboard green.
---
i rp as ministry of internal order and would like to know what these players are called
---
Placing the velocity, trans, angular on the select item will improve new bro knowledge. Aura explaining these numbers should also be a thing. Newbro should never be able to fire a gun and not hit, without the game explaining why that is the case.
---
Adding a little hover on how to improve this stat will also be a great help.
---
Hey i hired in a Startup and got to work on the GUI. Found out its c# with php weaved in
---
Remember when guns had tracking in rad/s and you could have an overview column that was also rad/s?
---
Thank god that was removed so that you can compare tracking of XL titan guns and blasters on a Thorax more easily
---
TestCancerPleaseBlue makes a lot of sense indeed
---
Anything else, really. JavaScript is usually considered. You can build the entire web stack in JavaScript.

I once wrote a script to be run as an hourly cronjob in PHP, just because I could.
---
Of course, I was a teenager, and it was a Frankenstein home server setup, but...
---
Why even mine in hisec if you're gonna be watching local.
---
Incursions are great. I've made a few bill this week. Cost about ~600m to get into the ship and will probably take you a few weeks to train the skills. But you can fly cheaper ones that will get you in (300m'ish).
---
Personally I'd do exploration in wormholes though. Yeah, its risky, but you can fly cheap T1 frigates and make a boat load. That's how I started making ISK.
---
I've been playing about 7 weeks BTW.
---
We all here living in 2019 while /u/Zippo-Cat living in 3019
---
Hahahaha funny thing is, we had just been discussing me upgrading that before the fight. Then i went and smoked a joint and forgot all about it hahaha
---
Wormholes are fun, I might look for incursions if I find a bro or Fleet for it
---
keep yourself safe brother
---
HAhahahahhaah i smoke drugs im so cool and laid back hahahahahahhahahahha
---
Gila can kill any high sec combat site
---
Because they didn't have damage caps.
---
bring more ships, they aren't dps capped
---
I've never understood why velocity isn't on the target reticle.
---
:( too soon
---
Wont be deleted
---
Then you wouldn’t be playing Eve!
---
YEET
---
but they do still, just not nearly as many.
---
Yea, AFK Orca mining is honestly a good way to take a shit, make a sandwich, clean the house, reply work emails and shit out the sandwich. All for 20 mil.
---
They are running a business here, painting killmarks on your ship.
---
Hi. I have a corporation "me and my characters LLC" (not a real name lol) and looking for place where i can build stuff. As i does not have jump freighter, nullsec rent is not a good choice for me.
---
So, the question is - are there alliances offering space for rent in c1-c2 wormholes?
---
Tried it once, got ganked, put me off doing it again
---
I'm gonna barge in and harvest some myself. It a shame that your gneiss comment will go so unappreciated.
---
Skill injectors definitely were definitely a sell-out. There's much better ways to make the beginner experience better.
---
I don't think skill injectors even improve a newbies gameplay. They don't know how to play, or fly shit, and I imagine most of them inject into some shitfit Battleship then whelp it in a L4 mission.
---
Aura: Would you like to start the tutorial on turret mechanics now? Est. Time: 1 hr 30 mins.
---
Hi, out of the loop noob here, what is this talk about POS Code? The stuff before citadel's?
---
I'm most familiar with C# (.net), but I'm constantly being told it's outdated. Hadn't considered Javascript for a back-end system.
---
Don't Ishtars generally carry light drones (among other drones).....light drones that could push the stiletto off?
---
Name a more iconic duo, Slyce &amp; Procurers
---
REEEEEEE
---
12 and a half with a little break in the middle
---
Use an orca. No one is going to bother ganking something with 100k ehp
---
i guess being an uptight asshole over a game is a better angle? idk what you want from me, also weed is a plant that grows from the ground. meth is a drug =\]
---
TBH; I am not sure if she talks about velocity. I know she talks a bit about webbing, so making her point out where to find the sat webbing effects makes sense.
---
do i need to link you my solo in a procurer? I KNOW ITS NOT BAIT, like i said before you're taking the loss a lot harder than i am.
---
it was low power to start with :)

I just love to see how much jumps can my ship do in the next 10 seconds, it's fun XD
---
I'd like to add that from the recent loki killed by squishy, people need to stop being scrub and fly those damn precision missile ffs. They are ment for small stuff even if your dps tank a little it's still better than fucking rage. Also, paint my dude, paint. Hams love paint!

---
That...kinda sounds like one of the symptoms of depression, man.
---
Remove timers from all unfueled structures. Been saying this forever. You should be allowed to carves through a citadel right then and there if there's no fuel in it.
---
I use asp dotnet core for back end. I find it works well, and is very easy to create a new API in, presuming you use Visual Studio or Rider (or are comfortable with its CLI tool).
---
I don't consider it outdated at all. Also I wouldn't worry about people saying that. Just use what suits the project, and your preference, every time.
---
Unfueled structured are still too op in my opinion. Just because you don't maintain your citadel shouldn't mean you can stick tether and dock, repair your stuff like nothing happened.
---
"Every trading partner was a real player"
---
...
---
BWA HAHAHAHAHAhahaha .... ;)
---
Yeah I know but it's upsetting having all these fucking things shitting up space.
---
Haha idk how this turned into some semblance of a witch hunt. Pretty sure half of Amarr low sec is constantly high :) Don’t take it to seriously man.
---
If that Ishtar wasn't shitfit and wasn't flown by a complete idiot, sure. In fact, it could easily gank both the Stiletto *and* the Kikimora under most circumstances.
---
Clearly this here wasn't the case.
---
Remove tethering from low power structures. Prevent refueling low-power structures if they're damaged.
---
I think you undervalued PLEX a bit ($19.99 USD base cost with some players getting better deals by buying in bigger quantities), which would bump up the Imperium GDP to probably closer to $10mil, but overall a well made video that I'll probably end up sharing.
---
Yup, all of the above really.
---
Couple things.
---
First off, for industrial purposes you probably want a C3. The extra static of a C2 is probably not an asset for you, and the C1's static is pretty strictly mass-limited. If you want to use a battleship or an Orca, you don't want to be in a C1. You probably do want a k-space static for the reliable logistics, otherwise I'd recommend bunking in a C5 for the ability to freighter stuff around.
---
The C3-&gt;High static is a massive 5b kg hole, which makes it a pain to roll. On the plus side, you can make a LOT of DST trips before one collapses. On the minus side, highsec holes near trade hubs are the holes that get camped, and if this hole gets camped your logistics are done for the day since you won't have a snowball's chance of rolling out the campers.
---
The C3-&gt;Low static is a more reasonable 3b kg hole. The plus side here is it's pretty unlikely to get camped, and if you get one to the middle of nowhere you can always roll it. The minus side is that you will have to do more rolling here, and while trips out to a trade hub will be quite safe you will have to scout a bit on your trips back in.
---
Second, don't rent your wormhole. If you've got a corporation to hold your characters, that means you have enough characters to hold down a wormhole as long as you don't make a target of yourself. Fuel your structures and you'll be fine. If you don't want to live alone, join a wormhole corp.
---
The best case scenario of renting your wormhole is that you end up with folks that either buy your product or build one of your inputs. An ok scenario is you join a PVP-focused group in a C2-&gt;High/whatever. You stock some consumables at \~Jita prices and promise to chip in with home defense if the group ever gets invaded. Depending on the group, you may be tolerated or you may be asked to participate in PVP fleets now and then. A bad scenario is you join any other industry-focused group. If they're active, they're driving up the local indexes cutting into your profits. If they aren't, they're painting a massive target on all of your backs the more of them there are.
---
I remember the guy, but haven't seen any updates.
---
On your own? You probably can't. You can warp the markets on individual items fairly easily, but the currency market is a bit too large.
---
He was so nervous he could not even link link where he was or who tackled him. Which is understandable if you never do pvp.

damn jack, its a joke not a dick don't take it too hard. idgaf if you snorted cocaine out of a strippers ass. live your best life. and id like you to link me a picture of YOUR dictionary set with a timestamp and your in game name. otherwise stfu lmao.
---
What we really need is for t2 battleships and faction battleships to be priced at a middle point between the 2, marauders are way too expensive for what they do and blops are just glorified jump gates these days.
---
And faction battleships are just way too cheap considering their power and for all others hulls t2 is priced around the same price as faction
---
You aware that you need to dock and take control of the structure for fuel and service module activation and structures you just anchored are low power?
---
i notice its the same 3 negative nancies in this thread just being themselves. angry and bothered that someone is playing the game the way they choose to lol.
---
He sounds a little Dense
---
Results may vary based on how far you get bumped
---
I ain't snuffed and I dont fucking understand
---
To be fair it has a few other problems. (Type casting, needle/haystack vs haystack/need, in_array vs gettype etc)
---
But WordPress is by far one of the worst major examoles of php code... And yet also one of the best.
---
Man that change pissed me off a lot.
---
Thanks for reminding me when the game was less obtuse
---
Hurrrr a video of crabs. Better go post it on a subreddit about spaceships.
---
In fairness there was also a car..
---
If you fit for max tank and don’t bling it at all, then you’ll rarely get ganked, although anything is possible
---
I think the general consensus is more tank.
---
yea, more tank, a lot more. Falcon more, rook a lot more.
---
Theres less posses than useless citidels.
---
that’s one hell of an upgrade from the guys reply
---
Scamming or ganking followed by T2 production and or market trading.
---
Down the other end is mining.
---
Somewhere in there is mission running and PI.
---
It makes sense. Structures should have to be actively maintained to be useful at all, and you shouldn't be able to just bring the structure to full power in the middle of a bash.
---
Removing all tethering period has nothing to do with that
---
nice, impressive stats. after shield slaves exist thatll maybe make the 1 mil mark fit dependant :)
---
i mean ive got my orca and 4 covs in by- i sure asf dont check our "intel" half the time, just sit in comms and stay active and way more isk ezpz
---
Also the citadel can still fight back, which is nuts.
---
&gt;Removing all tethering period
---
Show me where I said that.
---
It is only needed some times. An F1 pusher does not care, the FC cares a lot on the other hand.
---
I want newbeans to learn the game easier, whilst not removing depth for veteran players. Placing these number more visible with a very light and unobtrusive colour shade should allow newbeans more access to these stats. Placing an on hover to explain what the stats are and how to improve should allow for more education. 
---
It is these little detail CCP need to improve on, little details that improve player retention in the first few months.

scorpion is actually a tonne of fun to fly. you can get 700DPS out of it and an absolute beast active tank (triple XLASB) for some fun pvp all for 300-350mil.
---
There is nothing wrong with a galaxy being 25 billion light years away. You have to understand that we're both moving away from each other. If we both get in a car and drive 100 miles away from each other, it means we're now 200 miles away from each other. It's just with distances that massive, it takes light an extremely long time to reach us (it gets more complicated than that too with space/time also expanding, and the acceleration of expansion too). Therefore we're looking into the past whenever we observe a galaxy.
---
Out of all the options that you could build a web app with Javascript is the only one that's worse than PHP 😝
---
so you picked the worst tracking undersized guns to go on your battleship. it may look fun, but yall definatly need a grapple
---
its clear you got beaten in your childhood. \^\_\^
---
I think in the tutorials something is mentioned about slower ships being easier to hit.
---
Who the fuck ganks a Procurer considering how tanky it is? Surely there's a Retriever on the belt that would be a better target.
---
gimme all your ISK and I give you God-Mode ;-)
---
ofte its a case of: one miner bro is jealous or hates sharing and orders a hit on another miner bro.
---
the pirates scan the ship and give him the gank price, he pays as he doesnt spend his money on anything else.
---
then max tanked procurer, skiff, orca gets ganked by cheap fit destroyers once or twice.
---
i speak from experience.
---
From php to Javascript... This is the most selftelling definition to date for going from Charybde to Scylla. Good work.
---
Yea.. it just stood out to me as being quite hilarious. ;)
---
Disagree. Range is already high. If you want tank on them reduce ecm range to common tackle range.
---
as a person who inherited a project without documentation containing 30 year old c code in files reaching up to 640kb, on a monday with the glorious words "we just fired the people who maintained this project before. it's yours now. you can't ask those people anything."
---
yeah, i get you. (and also yeah, first thing i did was rip those monoliths apart and made 60ish files out of each, to get at least some functional grouping in something resembling managable size)
---
Nothing wrong with c#
---
Yes. Also bring back the Torpedo Naga! It was on SISI for a very short period before they decided to make it a turret boat and pushed it live.
---
\*\*Update:\*\*  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78306978/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78306978/)   Said pilot has now become one with the procurer and is helping.

It sounds like joining a different group might help.

I know, but that doesn't make it a scam. The outcome for the one buying the kill right is exactly the same.

is few years but our local 3 catalist code guy came to belt and started talking in local how its all just skiff and orcas. ofcourse he went to next system and got some obvious fool in retriever :P
---
Is this bait? I can't tell...
---
I mean some of that isnt wrong, SNUFF dont drop in NULL unless its either on a reginal back to low or DT
---
did the orcas have bulkhead and dc2 in lows and 3 adaptives+em field in mids? cause that gives you a 340+k ehp depending on skills and even more with overheating and shield links
---
anyway i had once 12 goon catalysts warp to ice belt and randomly choose my lucky skiff, well unlucky for them. i started to overheat my 2 therm / 2 kin t2 fields and by the time everything was over i was at 25% shield and picking up their wrecks. i think i got 20mil from their wrecks :)
---
Pretty much, before Citadels existed we had POS's as a way to dock ships in null sec. This old mechanic for living in null sec was changed drastically with the introduction of Citadels. The problem is that they still have yet to remove POS's from the game mostly due to the fact that the code for the POS's is deeply embedded in areas of the game that it really should not have been. Essentially if they tried to rip out POS's weird shit will break in the game that would disrupt players from enjoying it. Until someone with expertise skills in python (CCP has their own flavor of this language) can decipher the spaghetti mess of legacy POS code, it will be time till we see them fully removed from the game.
---
K
---
Yeah. At E-Uni's big HS moon system, Jufvitte, the CODE guys partly switched to smartbombing any augmented drones that they could find because of the lack of anything else besides Procurers and LOTS of Orcas. The Amarr Mining Campus is pretty much the same but with more Skiffs than Procurers.
---
It's a lot easier to fuck with an Orca pilot by killing his expensive drones while he's AFK than by blowing up his ship.
---
*ok
---
The fundamental problem with ECM ships is not their stats: it's that the current ECM mechanic sucks.
---
Yes they do. Almost got killed by a trap pos today.
---
Well I won't say I'm not curious, but at the same time, I'm not sure I trust CCP to release them without a pre-gimp to ships that would benefit from them. I'll keep some Isk handy just in case though ;)
---
The guy who writes eve-travel has a great big lore document. It's on his website (can't link right now, but just search the above).
---
Yesssss they need to realize how invincible speed ganking and tanking is AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE
---
While we are at it, I'm still waiting for that T2 Abaddon despite winning EVE many years ago. Khanid one would be especially nice - armor is their bonus and Amarr torp ship isn't going to step on anyone's toes. Why do we need it is another question, but eh.
---
that stargate is too fast for your guns to track!
---
Of course they are low powered, they aren't fueled
---
But how drunk were you?
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/evan\_mclean/clip/ImpossibleSleepyAxeAMPTropPunch](https://www.twitch.tv/evan_mclean/clip/ImpossibleSleepyAxeAMPTropPunch)
---
Yes and if you can't dock in low powered state, like Lyderian suggests, you are not able to change that.
---
maybe not remove them but make it only do the repair beam, and not the  invulnerability  thing.  
---
that way its a nice thing you get while siting there idle, but if you in combat or some ones attacking the structure its not a safety buffer.
---
Cant argue, you got cancer.
---
And if you cant keep all your shit fueled- be prepared to lose it
---
They're all over J-Space.
---
I agree. Having thought about it, I don't think it's the right way to go about it, unless you can turn it off easily. Vets will just use the overview and add a column. So, how do we get new bros to use the overview and understand all it's features?
---
I think doing a more forceful hand holding is necessary. As in, 'pause' the fight until the player clicks the web then resume. During this pause explain how tracking and speed works. Hell, maybe even put a simplified tracking equation up so they can see how it works. In conclusion, we have enough default ui elements and familiarizing via tutorial is the way to go
---
It is a cool ship. A T2 or faction variant would be amazing. 
---
Sadly it's got few practical uses apart from incursions

---
&gt; This reinforcement information will be obtainable by potential attackers using a relic or data analyzer module. Activating one of these analyzer modules will open a hacking panel similar to those found in exploration sites. The difficulty of the hacking challenge will scale depending on the size of the structure being investigated, with XL structures providing a more difficult hacking challenge than any previously available in EVE Online. After a successful hack a window will appear with the full information on the structure’s current reinforcement time and day, as well as any queued changes and the time that those changes are planned to take effect. Knowledge of the structure’s reinforcement time and day is crucial for potential attackers who wish to determine when their future fights would take place as well as plan how long they wish the structure to spend reinforced.
---
I'm pretty sure this only ended up as a feature on data analyzers, but you only have yourself to blame
---
Not being able to dock is excessive, I agree. However removing tethering from low power structures would be a good change.
---
I hope he didn't lie and actually did jet some paste.
---
I would be in denial as well.
---
i can relate :( mid 90's legacy code is AWWWFUL
---
So you're angry about a change in the world and you're going to lash out at people who had nothing to do with that change and no way to change it.
---
Are you a trump voting coal miner IRL?
---
Yes, and pls let me join fleet too!

So true, best way of making isk in null is to log in once every few days to reset the pi.

Having all these numbers on every ship on your screen is great for an FC, bit of a UI overkill for a newbean doing LVL 1 mistions. Does the overview even have these on it for newbeans? 
---
The biggest thing would be to have the light colour grade turn the number redish when it is too high for you to deal damage.
---
Making systems more accessible is 100% the way to go for many things in eve. It is better than removing systems to try and get more people to play the game. CCP need to improve newbean learning whilst retaining depth, not easy for any dev.
---
Cloaky Logi of course. Got to give it that solo kill. :D
---
Trial accounts are not anywhere near the same as alphas.  Dont compare apples and oranges.  I dotn have a clue where this is going.  My issue is that alphas as a group should bot be able to use throwaway alpha characters pretty much freely. That's it. Its bullshit and should be allowed.
---
I love battleship - target range/cargo boost wast a good first step bringing them back. Its time to make them stronk again, more guns, more tank, lock speed is fine it should be slow at hiting small targets, maybe a little bit so its faster then a dread.
---
I think the new number is more intuitive tbh.
---
Sure you could have rad/s on your overview and compare to the rad/s of your gun, but you still had to take signature into account. Just because a target was moving slower than your gun's rad/s doesn't mean you're going to track it.
---
Look at drones for example, their stats didn't get converted. T2 Berserkers have 0.852rad/s tracking. T2 Hammerheads have 0.696rad/s.
---
Of course, the signature resolution of Berserkers is about 3x that of Hammerheads, which means their effective tracking is much lower.
---
I don't think that's good game design. You should be able to look at the stats and make a decision on the numbers that are displayed. You shouldn't have to look up formulas and do math to do something as basic as comparing the tracking of two turrets. Especially new players won't even know the tracking formula.
---

---
I'm finally on Reddit lol!!! I've been gathering some more footage for another vid which should be out soon, unfortunately this kill was on my laptop in bed not my main PC so no video...
---
Yeah, shooting I-hubs in Dominion sov for hours on end was so much better.
---
It'll be interesting to see how echoes performs, being a super stripped down version.
---
Was the dodging mechanic in games like wow intuitive? I liked the floating damage/messages, but that wouldn't work so well in space with full 360. Maybe it'd be best to explain shit through well known, associated paradigms players already know
---
The joke is you lmao
---
An interceptor doing a wide orbit will take very little damage, even from light drones. 
---
Usually the drones will turn off their MWD when they catch up, hit a few grazing shots and then spend some time catching up again. Unless the ship has a drone velocity bonus like the VNI used to have. 
---
A snaked interceptor can just kite light drones forever.
---
How would that work? You'd be kicked out of the alliance in no time and you've wasted the effort of infiltrating them and gain nothing (since everything would be just cheaper to buy in Jita to begin with).
---
Wait. I'm fairly new, I'd love to have it be that.
---
WoW is slightly different in that you have at least 60 LvL to learn about a lot of mechanics that are not obvious like tank stats. When lvling as long as you were both the same lvl your damaged applied. With the exception of skills like rogue evasion, which were fairly obvious when they were poped.
---
In eve you can get your self in an awaked place where you saved up and bought a battleship and now you killing frigs takes twice as long. Most other games do not need to get over this information barrier. In modst other games, a bigger gun is always a better gun.
---
Ecm was fine before- there were counters.
---
People were just too fucking stupid to use them.
---
Nav Computers are a thing for a reason, my ratting Ishtar has way better damage and application that than shitfitted ship and will surely skull fuck any ceptor that dares catching it.
---
I wonder what would be better for the game and battleships, making battleships stronger again or turning everything else down a notch.
---
Balance team already down to blackout changes. We will see numbers left after summer.
---
&gt; Not my fault your part of the big blue blob 
---
so its acceptable and totally good for the game if the only place to find "content" is in like one of 3 big blocs main systems? I mean if i want guaranteed fight i can go fuck with horde every time, but its fucking boring fighting the same shit every day.   
---
This is my entire problem with you small gang lot, you're very thinly veiled with what you aim for, you want easy ganks instantly, with little to no risk of having to actually fight it out. You know full well just as I do that space outside of these main few null blocs is empty, yet you downvote every time hoping to hide that, just in case CCP see it and miraculously start to think about things logically and bring back local and life to more of null and take your easy mode safe ratter kills away.
---
Oh, i see... He was rock tanked...
---
and so is your posting
---
Now you just parroting other people's' suggestions
---
🍔
---
Totally agree, 🍔.
---
Lets not forget the amazong exploit that someone found with the POS code relating to the reactions and that went un-noticed for years.
---
ADC is OP and needs to be deleted thx
---
True, I just mentally filed away nav computers in the same category as other drone velocity bonuses.
---
"Skull fuck" is probably not the right term though. I fly a lot of interceptors and I've never been in a situation where a single flight of lights or even two just killed me. 
---
Even when estimating the numbers in favor of the drone ship (perfect application etc), we can assume 1000 damage per volley from a flight of lights every 4 seconds. A usual Stiletto has 5k ehp (still estimating on the lower end). That's 20 seconds to notice you won't hold, overheat your mwd and leave grid.
---
Whoever can't make that decision in **20 seconds** is either high or a horrible player.
---
I'm no trying to compare wow to Eve. Simply how both games display hits and misses.
---
yeah, but he uses retarded formatting
---
I do it sometimes , when im lazy .
---
goons isn't api verified, they don't like zkill
---
&gt;you want easy ganks instantly, with little to no risk of having to actually fight it out
---
Did you... even *read* what I wrote? Might want to get new glasses friend.
---
&gt;&gt;Dunking krabbers is nice to be sure, but the real fun is in enemies that shoot back.
---
Literally not even worth my time to argue with a brick wall, so this is my last comment on the matter. Hope you have a nice day, and may blue blobs suffer!
---
Well, that's true and I was exaggerating; but unless the ceptor has a lot of friends coming over, I can totally shake it off or kill it if he decides to stay around.
---
Just make sure to keep distance:/
---
Tried a 4/10 yesterday and got too close to some turrets...even with 80% resist I melted pretty fast when I tried to swoop in and loot a commander...
---
Is there any way to convert that number to an angular tracking one? I just came back and this change is annoying.
---
You say enemies that shoot back yet argue for a change that lowers the chance significantly. I.e youre being dishonest
---
Generally speaking in 2019 (for the backend):
---
* Python or Ruby if development speed is important due to the huge ecosystem of libraries and frameworks
---
* Javascript if that's what you/your team knows best is fine too
---
* Java or Go if performance is a major concern
---
* C# if you're a Microsoft shop

Thanks faymm!

Lmfao the spodbrain is strong with this one
---
Not my fault youre a pussy whos afraid of a subcap fight
---
Do you need protection from Code? PM me in game.
---
Extra fun when this is the war structure of the high sec elite pvp corp that declared war on you. And the war ends in 7 days.
---
That's true enough. I don't know how to make structures less of a plague, but hopefully one day it's sorted out
---
I mean alphas are pretty cheap right? XD
---
Some Alliances are sieves for spies and infiltrators.
---
So we have to rep it before refuling.... oh wait that is old Pos stuff ... get them back ???
---
tl;dr: i joined the biggest blue donut and now wonder where all my content went.
---
I recall the Dev team saying touching any POS code often broke the entire game in very unexpected ways.

Congratulations I guess.

*Those sweet million SP going into learning skils*
---
Usually something way too expensive.
---
Or, you know, something could be done to the default overview, so that newbros don't need to listen to the same line every time they join a corp: "Here's how you unfuck your overview"...
---
You can even get luckier, came across a site just the other day with a deadspace sheild module I sold for a little over 400m + a gila blueprint, all in one can....
---
Honestly, thats the most fun thing about running combat sites in high sec....because every once in a while you feel like you really hit jackpot...
---
Same with Hic sec hacking. Most of the time its a complete crapshoot, but once in a blue moon you get some really awesome stuff!
---
https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/
---
I can't think why CCP could not code it that way. Though if there is a reason, you can just make it so it is past tense. It goes red if you did not apply your damage well in the last shot.
---
Nah it's shit because it's badly designed and makes it easy to write garbage.
---
It's not honest if you're not paying for the permit.
---
Yea, it took me 3-4 years of trying every 5 or 6 months for a few days and getting frustrated and qutting. If you dont enjoy it quit. If you really want to like this game like I did it's a lot of work and patience.
---
Whatever card you intend to buy, make sure you research how much noise it generates during medium/high load. Very underrated and easy to disregard attribute.
---
You are not wrong but even if z-s overview was default, I would still want this change. A way to see these numbers without dragging my overview wider and having it shown for every object in space.
---
Tell gary i said I miss him.
---
Just got the confessor myself, but not over the moon in love with it yet. Feels like you got the DSP of a Cruiser, but the tank of a frigate at times:/
---
You can do lvl 2 easy, but lvl 3 (depending on the mission ofc), could be too much. Best advice would be to upgrade to a decent Cruiser, like the Gila, Stratios, Ishitar, Orthus, Omen NI or similar depending on skills, preferable weapon type, what prey you usually hunt and budget...
---
Pepega
---
I've said this before but worth saying again.  Citadels shouldn't be special, when a POS ran out of fuel it was a effectively a dead stick.  Citadels should be the same and be able to be killed instantly, no timers, no protection, no nothing.
---
They killed 10 billion in capitals, while only losing 26 ships, and you try to spin this into a win for the defenders?
---
Well at least u made it out. Some people don't.
---
Am programmer, get paid by the hour. I think I would be more productive if I got paid by line. Well, seem more productive at least.
---
Im in an auction and the thing keeps saying 12 days now...even though when I bid it said 4 days, and i saw it go down to 2 days...
---
Potato
---
I can't read battlereports, fuck I'm bad, oh well,
---
We need rapid bomblaunchers and anti capital bombs, each does 10k damage to caps
---
Anti Cap bombs actually sounds fantastic
---
Keep in mind T1 industrials fit for cargo space have a weak tank. There's a general rule for the value you can move (mostly) safely:  for every EHP, don't carry more than 2,000 to 3,000 isk worth of cargo. For example, if you have 10,000 EHP, then you can carry 20-30 mil isk worth of cargo without being an attractive suicide ganking target.
---
It's not a hard rule, as if someone wants to gank you, they'll just gank you, and you can get away with carrying more if someone else is a more attractive target at the same time you're passing by. Always using instant undocking bookmarks and instant docking technique on the majorly camped stations (like trade hubs) will also help you avoid getting popped on stations. 
---
If you want to do hauling as a career, definitely train into Transport Ships asap, as you can do low volume high value contracts much more safely in a Blockade Runner and Deep Space Transports can fit a solid tank for high sec work to carry you while you train for a Freighter then Jump Freighter. I recommend going Gallente for DST/BR and Amarr for Freighter/JF as good generalist choices. 
---
Good luck!
---
&gt;With the dawn of the Whaling/Delete Supers meta  
---
  
---
The what now?
---
I dont know, im not an expert like i said. 
---
however, I think you have misconceptions. cosmic expansion is the phenomenon whereby the 'scale of space itself is expanding'. space and matter within it doesnt move at all. 
---
again, the big bang was not about matter 'exploding' into space, but rather, the big bang was the entirety of the universe, and cosmic inflation was the expansion of space itself, expanding everywhere in some more or less uniform way, and not a point from which everything expanded radially. running the universe in rewind, you wont arrive at a point in space from which the universe expanded.
---
it seems so weird to me that you can run the neut without caping yourself out harder.
---
I used to use it to run wolf rayet c3 and lower solo
---
Here, fit this ECCM, now your chance to be jammed drops from 50% to 25%.

Also better start praying to RNG jesus.

 PATCH NOTES FOR AUGUST 2019 RELEASE - 2019-08-13.1
---
## RELEASED ON TUESDAY, AUGUST 13TH 2019
---
### Features &amp; Changes:
---
### Gameplay:
---
* War declarations: The transition period for non-mutual wars that do not have war HQ structures is now ending. Any non-mutual wars that have been continuing since before the Invasion expansion without a HQ will enter a 24 hour cooldown the next time a war bill belonging to the attacker organization is processed. All of these grandfathered wars will therefore end within the next week.
---
* War declarations: Reworked the system of enforced peace periods, which are created when surrendering a war or when a headquarter is destroyed. Each direction of an enforced peace is now tracked individually and can have different timers, if different actions lead to an enforced peace (for example a war is surrendered and then during cooldown the HQ is destroyed).
---
* The community fitting feature is now visible to all players with a small selection of new player fits. This entry in the saved fittings section of the ship fitting window displays example fittings that have been submitted by members of the EVE Online community and curated by the volunteers of ISD. The initial launch of the feature contains a set of new player fittings for the basic tech one exploration frigates as well as the Venture mining frigate. More fittings will be added to the list over time. If you are interested in suggesting fits for this feature head over to the [Community Fittings section of the official EVE Online forums](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/eve-information-portal/community-fittings).
---
### Implants:
---
* The pirate implant set formerly known as "Slave" has been renamed to "Amulet" in preparation for a future change to which pirate faction provides them to players. This change does not impact the functionality of these implants in any way.
---
### Missions &amp; NPCs:
---
* Triglavian Recon vessels have been sighted outside of Invasion zones.
---
### User Interface:
---
* Added text to the "All Wars" sub-tab in the Wars tab of the Corporation window to explain that the information there is cached for up to 15 minutes.
---
* Copying text from a text field will now copy it with all formatting. Copying without formatting is possible through a right click menu when some text is selected.
---
* The right click menu to load charges into modules now has icons representing the top 2 damage types for each of the charges. The charges are also ordered by range (range + 1 falloff).
---
* Importing of skill plans has been improved. When importing a skill, all the prerequisite skills will also be added if they are not already on the list. The skills that fail to import are now listed in a result window, from where you can buy the skills and add them to the queue.
---
* The order of the tabs in the Loyalty Point store has been changed so that the station owner's standard LP store will be shown first.
---
* Ship group names have been added to the title bar of the Show Info window
---
* A button, from where skills can be bought and added to the skill queue, has been added to the Show Info window for skills.
---
### Defect Fixes:
---
* Updated Meta Level 1 Shield Resistance Amplifiers CPU usage
---
* Added Warp Capacitor need to Zarmazd and Rodiva
---
* Addressed issue causing NPCs to not attack Capsules when in Abyssal Deadspace.
---
### __Graphics:
---
* Fixed issue with LODs on Caldari Industrial Crane.
---
* Fixed blinking killmarks on Caldari Cruiser Caracal.
---
* Fixed dirt layer on Triglavian Assault Cruiser Ikitursa.
---
* Fixed Roden logo orientation on Gallente Cruiser Phobos.
---
* Fixed missing pattern on Permaband Skin.
---
* Fixed Police Skin not showing GPD text on Gallente Titan Erebus.
---
* Adjusted shield size on Triglavian Leshak, Zarmazd and Rodiva.
---
* Adjusted shield VFX from fading out too soon when zooming out.
---
* Fixed visibility of the Caroline's Star Nebula when returning from an Abyssal Dungeon.
---
* Fixed asymmetrical decal inside Gallente hangar.
---
### Localization:
---
* Updated Triglavian Components and Triglavian Tech I Ships to reflect correct market group
---
* Fixed a few cases of NPCs showing incorrect damage types in their ShowInfo windows.
---
### Science &amp; Industry:
---
* Showing info on industry jobs in progress will now show the blueprint used, instead of the basic BPO.
---
### Text &amp; Descriptions:
---
* Fixed various punctuation, spelling and grammar issues.
---
* Updated Skill on Demand tick box to Not Show Again when selected
---
* Fixed an issue that could result in ESC menu being duplicated when opening game
---
* The Contextual Offer window should now show the same currency as the purchase page.
---
* Fixed an issue that could cause the "Warp to Within..." option to appear twice in the right click menu for some celestials.
---
* Fixed an issue where the "Engage Target" option in right click menus would not show as a suspect/criminal level offence (yellow/red text and skull icon) when in Empire Space with safety set to green.
---
* Fixed an issue where some Agents in Space would be missing the "Start Conversation" option in their radial menus.
---
* Fixed an issue that caused the ShowInfo windows of simulated Fighters to be unable to scroll correctly.
---
You mean kikis?
---
How the hell is the Scorpion not a battle ready ship? The hell you talking about? ECM is super powerful and has 100x more value on the field than ARokh would ever have even after these suggestions would be added......
---
Yes please! I’ve been using a Typhoon For years, would love a reason to move to another hull.
---
It just seems like a popular theme lately
---
&gt;Triglavian Recon vessels have been sighted outside of Invasion zones.  
---
Heres hoping they mean actual recon ships
---
SO your guns had tracking of 0.1 rad/s and the target was flying at 0.1 rad/s.
---
From this you could not say much about wether you would hit the target because the guns also had signature resolution and the target has signature radius that would be thrown in the hit calculations.
---
In the case where target signature radius was same as turret signature resolution the hit chance would be... 50%.
---
People who keep repeating this same false claim are bad. Just stop this.
---
Yellow comic sans on black backround, alternating caps, and linkin park. It was a DBZ fansite....
---
I think there a role for something similar to the kiki that can take a blops bridge
---
What is the easiest way to transfer items between systems and characters? Basically I have a Jita and an Amarr alt I want to trade goods between but I'm not actually sure how to go about it. Is there some way to create a courier contract but have the items transferred to the alt when they are delivered?
---
The jump gate, cyno beacon and cyno jammer do not allow docking.
---
You board them with your capsule and to fuel them you drop the fuel straight to the cargo hold.
---
Yes.  Bombers would not be at all overpowered with such a weapon.
---
Yeah or a trig cov ops frig, afaik they wanted to make trigs a proper faction.
---
Damage bomb that works like focused voids?
---
Just fuck already
---
&gt; From this you could not say much about wether you would hit the target because the guns also had signature resolution and the target has signature radius that would be thrown in the hit calculations.
---
Yes, **if** the target had different signature radius than your guns you'd have to do terrible math like "divide by 4".
---
I've been playing for 2 years, started off doing HS mission running, some mining before building up a bit of capital and doing market trading.  Recently I've been very bored, I hit my 'target' of 100B net worth so been playing less and less.
---
Then Skilling Spree started, I fired up an Alpha account and used all the free SP to skill into an exploration ship.  Now, rather than sitting in Jita 0.01 isking orders all day, I fly around wormholes, grabbing loot and getting into scrapes.  To put the cherry on top I've made about 400M in the 2 weeks since I started the char.
---
My point is that even for 'seasoned' players, the event has given me a push into having more fun.
---
&gt;In the case where target signature radius was same as turret signature resolution (shooting ship of same size as yourself with no MWD or much shield buffer tank) the hit chance would be... 50%.
---
Yeah; i think that would be a good balancing factor
---
ccp have cancer in brain
---
those 17cm refer to the entire universe, not just the matter within it, but spacetime itself. its not that spacetime existed, and that the matter within it was compressed into a 17cm sphere somewhere in space, but rather that the entire universe was 17cm across. 
---
here are some good explainers:
---
https://www.universetoday.com/36653/center-of-the-universe/
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe
---
I second this, you have to wait for next patch for the npde to fully restart.
---
I did submit a ticket to CCP, however I did not get an actual answer on the subject, other than that I would get a notification if the ISK was deemed illegal
---
Yes ... will be covert "brandership" with aoe dd weapon which insta kills supers, titans and most important citadels no matter if they are fuled or not (no timers apply!) ... but is will get gestroyed during this ...
---
And?
---
I sure love this long awaited patch not having any balance changes at all after CCP stating that they'll focus heavily on balancing instead of making new content

I remember starting out in high sec mining. Was casually working like two jumps out from Jita as I was watching videos on youtube from various creators on the various aspects. Nice and chill as I learned about wormhole exploration and the magic of torpedo delivery.
---
Ah the bambi days.
---
scrolled this comment thread just to find the parent comment. Wasn't disappointed. :D
---
I will say that seeing them wardec CCP left me amused. They actually wardecced more corps than PIRAT which also amused me.
---
Universe-wide invasion incoming?
---
This hits home, I live in null and lost my orca to a goon fleet of like 20-30 legions etc :( sucks cuz it’s hard to get one and I’m low sp; been using the baby orca cuz I don’t wanna lose another one
---
Have you heard about our lord and saviour Google?
---
I agree with the sentiment but really think that PHP/JS/Ruby/Python are all in the same category nowadays, each with significant WTF moments in their own right. If anything I would recommend newbros to avoid Ruby, because it's been the most obsolete ---- judging by the projects I've encounted in recent years.
---
It's really the experience and practices around the code that make or break the application and/or team, which is the main point and probably what the discussion should center around instead of language preference. This is especially true when the debate is between dynamic/non/optionally typed scripting languages.
---
With a hint of sarcasm: testing for this opinion marker covers 80% of the experience assessment when interviewing candidates :D
---
Remove unanchor timer too of low power structures.
---
I managed 34 seconds using a glass cannon blaster fit that does immediately after getting the challenge
---
Or just keep the current instant rep after a timer thing, since sitting on a POS waiting for it to finish repping is kinda cancer.
---
I'm going thrxough my emailsed
---
I wanted to like this video but the constant zooming in and out not focusing on what is going on I had to stop watching it.
---
&gt; Importing of skill plans has been improved. When importing a skill, all the prerequisite skills will also be added if they are not already on the list. The skills that fail to import are now listed in a result window, from where you can buy the skills and add them to the queue.
---
Cool. Now can we have more than 50 skills in the queue at a time and can we get rid of the bug where clicking "do not show me this again" on the skill queue purchase confirmation doesn't actually do anything?
---
I see... Well, I think you are out of the woods then! xD
---
Just enjoy the leg up on your wallet :)
---
Have fun, and fly save brother capsulers. May one day we meet in glorious combat o7
---
space is expanding uniformly because the expansion of space is not referring to objects within it moving, but rather the scale of the universe itself is expanding. this expansion is happening everywhere, at the same time, in the same way. This leads to a concept whereby the center of the universe will appear to be wherever the observer is located. space appears to be expanding uniformly in all directions from wherever they happen to be observing. 
---
the very first sentences from the wiki article i linked: " The **expansion of the universe** is the increase of the [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_length) between two [distant parts of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Size) with [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe#cite_note-NYT-20170220-1) It is an [intrinsic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_properties_(philosophy)) expansion whereby *the scale of space itself changes*. The universe does not expand "into" anything and does not require space to exist "outside" it. Technically, neither space nor objects in space move. Instead it is the [metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity)) governing the size and geometry of [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime) itself that changes in scale. " 
---
for the last time, im not an expert, but then you clearly arent either, and if you think these ideas 'break physics' perhaps you should take it up with the cosmologists who spend their lives thinking about and developing these scientific theories.
---
The engagement profile is limited anything with drones or missiles you will probably lose to due to small tank and no effective range control advantage.
---
Yeah but listen if you write it in RUST it will be VERY FAST and its IMPOSSIBLE to write bugs.
---
I'm sure you meant arousing.
---
the fit is actually cap stable.
---
You shouldn’t

If you are okay with using a 3rd party courier service (such as Red Frog), then simply make an item exchange contract from alt A to alt B in Jita, so the items change owner, then have alt B set up a courier contract from Jita to Amarr. That way, once the items get there, they will show up in alt B's item hangar. You can do all this remotely, regardless of where either alt is currently stationed.

You are shoot first. That by definition a no brain thing.
---
Space isn't expanding uniformly.
---
Electrons aren't getting further away from the nucleaus. Atoms aren't getting larger.
---
Things are being propelled apart.
---
They call it just an expansion because we can only collect data from a relative position and not an absolute position by which to determine which is moving and what isn't or by how much.
---
Space getting further between two objects is movement. We just don't know which or by how much.
---
If space itself is growing like you suggect, EVERYWHERE that has space, including inside atoms, would be growing in the same way. If not, then how you are discribing would not be withing the laws of physics.
---
That's even weirder.

Maybe its time for a anticaptital superbomber in cruiser size

A bit over 22 seconds with artillery slasher. In one of the starter systems there is a site 0.7 AU away from station with rats that have so little HP you could probably alpha them with civilian weapons.

I also got a bit over 21 seconds with smartbombs. But the rules of the contest made it seem like you had to lock the target.

Thank you! I’ve got 2 more days before I head home so I’ll be sure to make my way there

Hi, when you gank, you also die, so your killboard is not green.

When you gank, you can potentially make billions in one fell swoop if the loot fairy says yes.

I mean, MiniLuv doesn't do what they do for killboard stats lol.

i hope a triglavian recon ship

No, because then when the enemy deploys you just pull the fuel blocks, wait a short time for it to go low power, then unanchor.

I honestly haven't used MongoDB much but I've never seen a compelling reason to use it that doesn't boil down to "I can't be bothered to learn how SQL actually works". NoSQL is a really cool field but specifically MongoDB just seems like the worst of all worlds.

If I want to hop back on for a bit, I have a few alpha accounts too, including one set up for incursions. I may resub when winter sets in and I don't have to do as much outdoor maintenance on my property. For now, my gaming time is little and precious, and I'm a console pleb at heart.

Except you technically do with how long it takes you to lock on.. and that's what an engineer would use as a signature reference, so there's some logic that it should be available to the sensor technology of ships.

I mean if Horde is your target it might work but most alpha friendly Nullsec corps vet their recruits pretty thoroughly. I mean Karma require stool sample (I can tell you it was quite messy).

The above scorpion fit is roughly 138 million. The insurance payout is roughly 90 mil at platinum, so if he active the 190 million kill right on it and kills it. Then the scorpion is paid 90mil in insurance payout + the 190mil payout on his alt for the kill right.  
---
So basically you just gave him 280 million for a fucking 138 million scorpion.

22-23 seconds as of yet.

I think RF on a M should be two days per RF cycle and three days for large. Only XLs should be granted the full cancerous time. Of course this means a low power M would only take two days instead of four and the L would only take three. I think this is a bit more reasonable. If you can't find allies within two days in your prime time, you're probably already going to lose the structure anyway.
---
I do think the unanchor timer for M and L should also be lower. A large POS took considerably less time to unanchor. If you had haulers on standby, a gunned POS could be finished in a matter of hours (not the unanchor timer but the time from when you pulled the first gun to the time you unanchored). I think several hours for a M and a few days for L strux would be good.
---
This is actually so true

If you're going to stare at rocks, stare at rocks that are worth the mind numbing experience.  Do it in null sec.

Battleships are in 3 categories, Attack, Combat and Disruption. Every race except Caldari have 2 attack battleships and 1 combat battleship. Caldari have 1 combat (Rokh) and 1 attack (raven) battleship.
---
By CCP's own words, the Scorpion is a disruption battleship. Which is neither an "Attack" or "Combat" Battleship. That doesnt mean the scorpion cant be a in combat and isnt useful, but there is a big difference between a combat battleship and a disruption battleship as far as EHP, fittings, dps go. Caldari are missing 1 combat capable BS, so instead of adding another one, just make the Rokh multi-role.
---
There's already a limited availability recon cruiser, the Tiamat. Maybe make that more widely available.

May the spod be with you
---
I'm not crying, YOU ARE ;(
---
whether or not you shoot it when you find the timer, you still have only one time a week it can be destroyed. Even if you are not actively shooting it, it is still a ton of waiting.
---
I'm not the one describing it that way - im relaying to you the way big bang theory and cosmology thinks about these ideas - the issue is that you have misconceptions about what they mean. 
---
"Space getting further between two objects is movement."
---
with this specific example you cite: you can measure the distance between two objects at any given time and see that there space between them is growing, but no force or inertia is applied to the objects for them to do so. instead, it is the 'canvas' upon which the objects themselves lie that is expanding. take a football pitch with some footballers on it and then imagine stretching the pitch in all directions equally. over time, the distance between the footballers will grow, but none of them are actually moving or having a force exerted on them. 
---
"Electrons aren't getting further away from the nucleaus. Atoms aren't getting larger."
---
This is the same as saying that space is not expanding because andromeda is moving towards the milky way and again stems from a misconception - in this particular case that "space is expanding" - no, its the scale of space that is expanding. you can read the details of this concept here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity) 
---
cosmic expansion is a large scale cosmological phenomenon, within which the other forces still act, ie gravity can still attract things so that they are approaching you, the strong force still keeps nuclei together etc. 
---
anyway, i think im done here, you seem to be unable to accept that perhaps your understanding of what are admittedly very strange and difficult ideas to conceptualize might be lacking and instead are trying to argue that cosmology is wrong because it doesn't conform to your perceptions and understanding of the ideas.

im going to presume this is just after you hit shield, returned, hit armour, and got this timer.

Good bot
---
I believe some things drop in stacks with a single roll, so if the filaments were stacked, there was just an overall 50% chance that the stack dropped or not.
---
I thought CCP did say outright that the 25/50k options would be rarer?
---
Also, RNG doesn't necessitate equal probability; I'm not sure what you mean by that.
---
On the character you got 25K and 50K, have you been doing the Skilling Spree every single day on those characters? I'm curious if they have made it so that if you do the event every day, you only get 10k, but people who don't do it every day get a change to get 25k and 50k.....
---
I agree. I should be able to fly around space instantly blap low power citadels with my inty and occator trailing behind to salvage and loot.
---
Define fell
---
Yeah it's just boring is all. 55 million hp is silly.
---
Tbf concentrated V  has pretty good resists.
---
I've been doing it every day. I usually get at least one non 10k on a char per day. Very rarely do I ever get all at 10k.
---
Had the 25 and 50 here as well. The chances are not equal, but that doesn't mean it's not RNG. Just like turret damage is RNG, but wrecking hits still have ~1% of happening
---
Indeed clearly another example of a noob with too much isk. He should have have been fine.

btw, WTS citadel bombs
---
Well I was actually tackled by spod yesterday. My warp ended and I landed in the middle of a huge asteroid, could cloak or warp off due to my ship rubbing its face  on the inside of an asteroid ( don't actually know what kind it was). Died to the rats..
---
Thank you!
---
Add a signature radius to the bomb, something like 8km radius, so it would be ineffective against subcaps (like neutralizers)
---
Yes CCP should definetly look into the positives an anticap bombs bombers bomb launcher can offer to the meta.
---
&gt; Also, RNG doesn't necessitate equal probability; I'm not sure what you mean by that.
---
The very definition of random requires equal probablity: "Statistics. of or characterizing a process of selection in which each item of a set has an equal probability of being chosen."
---
People say RNG when things are not at all RNG, its a weighted system.
---
Yeah, not being in Delve helps.

The problem is the short sighted bitter vets who think "Oh iv been playing 10 years noobs should be able to fly what i fly or get catch up skillpoints" so short sighted ....

Having recently gone through the New Player thing, I disagree with a lot that is posted on Reddit about the experience - In general it's nowhere near as bad as vets seem to think it is (Though there are good ways to improve it, which is not the same thing). However, the Overview definitely needs a change. Simple things do not show, or don't show in a good place and it's not very clear that you can change the overview (or more to the point, it doesn't occur to you that the default won't show much).
---
Then, when you work out you can change it, the actual system for changing it is not at all intuitive and requires a decent amount of googling. Obviously when you get the hang of it, the functionality is actually pretty good, but the unneccesary difficulty is very out of line with the necessary difficulty of much of the rest of Eve.
---
So this is what I saw yesterday. Started to wonder why there were Tyronnos NPCs in a system that wasn't invaded.
---
They have an accelerator that comes with the starter pack, it can only be used in the first 35 days of the account, gives +3 to all attributes, and gives 20% extra damage for the duration.
---
&gt; Ccplease anticap bombs bombers' bomb launchers?
---
No I think you just forgot one apostrophe (FTFY) but I'm interested who is this "Ccplease anticap" who bombs the bomb launchers of bombers?
---
They have a place in the game but for a while they held almost every place in the game.
---
 "So, how do we get new bros to use the overview and understand all it's features? "
---
\- tell them it has features. 
---
A short addition to the tutorial explaining it would be brilliant, but seriously, just knowing there ARE features is usually enough to get people looking into what those features are.
---
If you wanted to actually add something to the tutorial, have something deliberately not show on the overview (As opposed to by accident as is currently the case occasionally) and walk through adding it in. Could also show people how to remove stuff (Like structure spam in combat sites) the same way.
---
Ramping webs? Ramping range on warp disruptors? Ramping neuts?
---
Just show a color indicator of how often you are hitting vs missing.
---
They absolutely improve gameplay for noobs that want to help in small corps. I was able to get into a stealth bomber for blops, foreman ship to help mining ops, T2 autocannons, T2 drones, etc. This means that now some of the training I'm working on is way more exciting. If I was still waiting on autocannon T2 to train instead of seeing stuff for T2 ships finishing, I might not be as excited to log in.
---
That was a capital R so that's probably what we're getting. Oh god.
---
Better check that match bud. Eve came out in 2003.
---
Doesn't the "spam engage" trick to keep the drones from downcycling the MWD work anymore? It used to deal with that problem quite nicely in the past.
---
yeah that's obviously what it is, sick assumption bro
---
it's on relic analyzers too, also it's still dumb and terrible, stop posting
---
the meta is to be in a massive capital ship. It should be no surprise that people bring the literal thing that's designed to be a threat to them, and dodge the thing that can hit them back. You wanna see less bombers? Then people need to undock less caps.
---
i do it on 3 toons. never had 50k, had 25k maybe 7 times altogether. nearly always its the 10k
---
And where is our disruption for Matar? We have Tempest, Phoon, and Strom? Who the hell cares. Scorpion is an amazing ship.
---
It's just RNG. They didn't actually stage it properly. I got a 50k yesterday.
---
The very definition of random requires equal probability... according to one specific definition in one particular field.
---
Did it occur to you - and this is a wild hypothetical - that maybe the general public and programmers and such don't use this word in a statistical context, with this one definition in mind? Just throwing it out there.
---
Make a new t2 destroyer hull with same bonuses as stealth bombers but twice as much launcher hardpoints, so twice the dps. And give them penalty to explosion radius and velocity so they would apply poorly to subcaps.
---
But this could be fun
---
Nope, but even if it was the Damavik would still be more desirable.
---
yeah but it is easy to read what it says and a bit harder to expect the scenario
---
Carriers already useless. Killmarks piniata.
---
Dreads balanced
---
Supers too cheap
---
Titans too cheap

Anticap bombs would push capitals to extintction.

Ohey dude. I resubbed a while ago.

Things that are going on: no local in null. Roaming and small gang is fun. That's what people are happy about. Botting is through the floor, plex prices are crashing.
---
People are mad about the big blocs clamping down on it super fucking hard, doing huge manips in jita, and otherwise being super toxic for game health.
---
Sov war is still boring as all fuck. The big blocs came together to form a super mega blue donut in hisec, known as Serenity Coalition because it's ruining the game like China.

When i want to just chill and chat with my dudes, i or 2 orcas in highsec. One has mining boosts, the other shield boosts. I put one drone per rock, and then chill. Sometimes my 3rd skiff will join the party and i of course like boosting the newbros if they are around. It's not about making isk per hour. 
---
For that, i will lowsec ice mine. 2 covetors and a max boost Porp.  Lots of managing of the I've though and lots of trips to drop off the ice but everything is fast align if unknowns join the system. 24-25m every 12-14 minutes before compression.
---
Assuming you’re solo hunting in this lovely ship, take arty over HAMS, a well tracked shot will pretty much deal with all ships up

To destroyers in a single shot. Also awesome for dealing with cruisers over time and even some BC’s.

We have a 3rd BS hull to utilize as well

---
fit on clipboard is wrong

 fit reverted back to previous build.
---
What a retarded idea. There's plenty of missile-based battleships (Raven, Navy scorp, golem, typhoon, barghest) if you want to fly one. While rokh isn't very popular, it fits in the line of caldari hybrid-turret bonused boats. I guess you'll be asking for naga, ferox, moa, cormorant and Merlin to be converted to missile boats as well? Arguably hybrid turret damage bonus would be more useful than range bonus though.
---
Only made it through 10min of "Backdoor wormholes".
---
It might be that they are used in the Triglavian invasions. Not bothered with them myself so I might be wrong tho.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78308251/

can someone explain why i keep seeing these JF killmails with rorquals as tackle? been seeing them for a few days now on kb. do you think it's a new meta because most JF pilots won't think they're in danger seeing a rorq on the undock?
---
Yes, SRP managers love those, easiest decision to deny SRP.
---
Youd need to ask CCP, theyre the ones that shorthanded caldari by being the only race with a disruption battleship. I never said the scorpion wasnt a good ship, but it serves a different role as a disruption battleship which means caldari are short 1 attack battleship.
---
60 days? You need to do that on a better attribute remap.
---
Learn to read. It wouldnt be converted to a missile ship, it would just have the option to fit a full rack of launchers or a full rack of hybrids. It means it would be multi-role, literally nothing else has to change on the ship except adding +4 launchers. It would still retain the hybrid range bonus
---
Yeah dude, I'm a fuckin carebear in wormhole space.  You've got me pegged.  If you actually lived in wormholes you'd just remember this shit.  My static(s) are X and X.  To roll it I need this many C/H passes with a Mega.  Or I need one pass with my cap since I'm a high class champion.  
---
Obviously this is all too much for you.  Maybe you'd be better served in nullblocs.  All you need to do is remember where your F1 button is - seems like it's more your speed.
---
Everyone should use the Magnate because no one should be cherry picking. It's so douche.

&gt;Of course it did, you should totally be reimbursed /s
---
Obviously you know better than Salty does, being a random armchair analyst on reddit.
---
Who?
---
It's a different kind of fun. Being on the field knowing that you have massive staying power and punching power, and just slowly grinding through a fleet. It's the same reason why I miss battleship meta, and why I love my typhoon so much.

---
Ignore anyone that tells you to use a cargo scanner. Not only is it the definition of douche to cherry pick and leave sites unfinished, but you also lose out on isk and experience. The only time a site should be abandoned is if you sure being hunted and you cannot finish it. It's a waste of a mid slot that could be used for improved scanning or survivability.
---
Didn't kill the Nyx... feelsbadman.
---
I've actually not heard of this one.  Assuming it's been patched out, what's the story?

Wow totally forgot about that anti capital bomber idea ..thanks for bringing it up for the 123567283 time
---
Yeah I just pretend I'm caught out in a WH and have to poop really bad. Same procedure, really ;)
---
This is reasonable enough
---
Yes. Limited availability, like I said. Would be interesting to have something like it more widely available. Even if it's not that precise ship.
---
Maybe its time for an anti-anti-capital bomber capital?
---
Long answer - No, we didn't.
---
That is basically the CODE manifesto, yes.
---
Yeah, my graphics settings are on max. Just poor editing skills :)

I only got my 1st 50k "quest" 2 days ago. Every one before that was 10k.
---
Counterpoint: What good reason is there for keeping the limit in place?
---
honestly just idle 3 orcas on ice belts. You can use the agency thing and it will just straight up tell you where the closest ice belt is, then you go out and launch your ice drone, check on it every half hour or so, brick tank it. It will never die.
---
Tbf he might've linked his fit
---
Using statistical methods to study how in/frequently something occurs is statistics. Also, a statement such as "the outcome of x is random" - going with the dictionary definition of "random" as "depending on chance" - does not imply anything along the lines of frequency or probability.
---
26 seconds, and I did it with smart bombs so not even sure if it counted. Def coulda been faster if I bothered to find a belt close to undock align, but I had fun with it regardless
---
Because it'll take some dev time to change it?
---
Probably not much, but you never know what insane design choices were made, back when the skill queue was first created.
---
You ever heard of void bomb
---
Step 1: Look up the most popular (read: stuff that will remain popular...so keep an eye on patch notes!) modules/ships including some popular faction items. Note down major swing lows (multi-week or month lows). You can use killboards to figure out what's popular.
---
Step 2: Whenever something hits or gets close to those major swing lows, you buy in bulk at major hubs. You can max your profits with buy orders, but sometimes you can just grab stuff off market at sell prices if it's really at a good swing low. I use Mogul to set up alerts.
---
Step 3: Patience...lots and lots of patience. You do NOTHING after buying and just sit on it until prices recover from that swing low. This might happen in a week, or a month, or 6 months...but eventually, prices will recover from swing lows. You want to trade stuff that has large swings in price.
---
Step 4: Sell once stuff is back at swing highs or above. Obviously babysitting sell orders will maximize profits, but if the swing is large enough, selling quickly &amp; easily to buy orders and reinvesting that capital is the more hands-off approach not forcing you to play the constant price fight at stations.
---
If you do that and constantly compound winnings, you'll be a multi-billionaire after just a few weeks/months with very little time commitment. This is a long term approach allowing you to enjoy the game without having to grind massively. You never have to haul anything this way and all you really need is patience. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, trade different stuff to spread risk.
---
And yup, you need standings and the proper trade skills of course.
---
No, the whole point of AT ships is that they are unique. If there is another trig recon ship why would anyone ever undock the Tiamat?
---
I'd go with RLML, because even if Loki only had a ROL bonus it's still the best skirmish weapon for a solo player
---
If you can't kill something within one clip, the chance of you killing it with other weapon platforms is unlikely anyway
---
Still want them to fix the camera bug when deploying a structure.
---
Never switch the camera type when in deploying mode!!!! Or all features of cameras get mixed up. For example I have no distance lines on any of them anymore.
---
good girl ( ◠‿◠)
---
Battleships have huge mass, which is quite a big problem if you're using wormholes to hunt grabbing carriers and supers, and if you want to hunt them in ships that can be bridges by a black ops.
---
Tips:
---
Take three covetors.
---
Add a null sec r64 moon.
---
Table spoon of rouqule boosts.
---
Heat for one hour per 300mill as desired.
---
On a serious note, black out has not effected null sec moon in any decent alliance. If you was dying, it was not because of the black out. Most mining fleets can eat small gangs and small bomber fleets quite easily.
---
That sounds awesome dude. 
---
I take donations btw
---
It's still a stupid idea. Why not also then give turret slots to a Drake because I want to mine in it?
---
I've yet to come across anything that beats playing major market swings. All you need is capital and patience.
---
Might want to stock up on food and water, gonna be a long wait.

Yeah, why have these corps died?

That sounds reasonable.

It's a pretty minor QOL improvement that is an objective benefit to the game.

No-one here is saying that this should be absolute top priority, all I'm saying is that being able to queue up more than 50 skills at a time would be a nice thing to have.

I see it's time to post "Plz buff risk adverse WHers" for the 6th time this week

Did they raise the taxes of NPC market hubs though ?

he was useless then he was creating content, cant you get a clue? Let me break it down for your smooth brain, out of 100 useless noobs maybe 3 will be afk miners and 1 will be of value of to the game.

I got this crazy idea...
---
Make caps the ones best at killing caps
---
Make subcaps the ones best at killing subcaps
---
Pretty wild ikr
---
mathematics is already a complex enough field without people spreading half true wisdom about it...
---
The idea that a definition of randomization always contains any correlation to the probability of the events is just plain wrong. There are fields in physics and mathematics that try to understand patterns and explore their "randomness" and the idea they would thereby correlate to any type of equal propability is just stupid. 
---
Also you guys are all throwing different kinds of words into one bucket. RNG refers to random number generator which is a technical term for the theoretical idea to have a perfect machine that produces uniformly distributed numbers that are impossible to predict. There is a decent article about it here: [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1229686/mathematically-what-are-random-numbers](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1229686/mathematically-what-are-random-numbers)
---
In modern information technology we have good enough ways to approximate such a behavior and we call it RNG and it may be used to determine which daily quest you get. So there might be a random number generator that produces a value between 1 and 100 and if your number is below 11 you get 50k if its between 11 and 30 (including boundaries) you get 25k and otherwise you get 10k. The number that the decision would be based on is produced by a RNG machine and therefore is a "random" number even by the most strict definitions. The decisions based of that number would be "random" in the way they would be unpredictable other than given general probabilities like 10% for 50k, 20% for 25k and 70% for 10k. They would not be equal likely though. In social use of the word random (and in other mathematical fields!) this doesnt not make that process less random in any way!  
---
Now we are getting into "random" as it is used in our society. The different definitions of random are discussed on an easy level in this blog for example: [https://creativemaths.net/blog/random-meaning/](https://creativemaths.net/blog/random-meaning/)
---
For gaming specificly there are very interesting papers looking into randomization to keep people interested in games and in not a single of these papers I could find any statement or definition that assumes that random means equal likely. In fact most games are based around the concept that the best results of a random process are LESS likely than the average ones. This makes the process itself not less random?!
---
TLDR: The idea that random correlates to an equal distribution of probabilities is true for a very limited set of mathematical definitions mostly in the field of statistics. It does not correlate to the social use of the word and does not translate to the statement CCP made in any way.

A few years ago back during the stunt stratios hayday I would pretend to afk rat in a pvp Ishtar.  Had some pretty fun fights against those.  But Ishtar outmatched them in a brawl and it was pretty trivial to look like you are trying to run away and then slingshot them.

2-3 days in my experience
---
Don’t add to your ticket, it pushes it to the back of the queue
---
You're doing it again. Words can have more than one meaning.
---
Let me rephrase: A statement such as ... does not make any assertions regarding the probability/frequency of the outcomes.
---
Keep digging, though. It's vaguely amusing.
---
Good point I didn't think of that. Although I like the panicking PvE player story more.
---
Because the drake has an actual missile damage bonus, the Rokh does not have any actual damage bonuses. Meaning either weapon system is interchangeable without penalty. The drake also has 0 turret hardpoints, whereas the Rokh already has 4 launcher hardpoints. Adding 4 more launchers is not as big of a stretch as adding 6 or 7 turret slots to a drake.
---
The last point is because (which i stated in OP) is that caldari are down a combat battleship (Scorpion is technically a disruption battleship), which means the Rokh can become multirole. 
---
Your drake example is wrong because caldari BCs are equal to other races, they arent missing a combat BC like Caldari are missing an Attack/Combat battleship. Making the rokh multirole is an easy way to add variation to the Caldari battleship line-up without making a new ship and literally nothing else has to change on the Rokh except giving it 4 more launchers.
---
Yup, this exact scenario was what I was telling myself I'd have to do if I wanted to minimize the time. Looks like I certainly wasn't the only one.
---
just use focused void bombs.   neut the cap and then the capital can't do anything.
---
and bombs are the anti capital ship already.  take a fleet of them vs a dread.   see how easy it is vs if you bring a battleship fleet.
---
small bombers hard to hit with dread weapons.
---
A rough estimate is EU has the most actives, US is close, AU/CN are pretty shit

Equal chance vs long-term distribution
---
"I wonder if the problem is that randomness is somehow equated with fairness. Our most familiar examples of true randomness come from gambling, with dice, cards, roulette wheels and lotto balls. In each case there is the requirement that each outcome be equally likely.
---
Bearing in mind the overwhelming evidence that the “statistical meaning” of randomness includes equality, I begin to think that it might not really matter if people equate randomness with equal opportunity."

It was a long time ago, even before the moon min balance that made Tech the bottleneck, however someone in Lowsec had figured out you could run POS reactors without actually needing the raw material in the silo it fed from, effectively creating moon reaction materials from nothing.  Apparently when they got caught it had been ongoing for a few years and was heavily affecting the moon mineral market.

Unless they have a single cap booster, just load navy 200s or whatever and gg lol, cycle your invulns with your 100s of boosters loaded

Or if it’s armour tanked you don’t have to do anything
---
At least my meaning are coming directly out of the dictionary, where your meanings are coming out of your rear end.
---
strange, never seems to stop bomber's bar.
---
works fine for them.
---
maybe you should try flying in a bomber fleet before complaining bombs not strong enough, you need stronger bombs.
---
ramping neuts would fit thematically and would be fun IMO. do you let your own cap get low to keep your nuet stacks stay? adds a layer, new mechanic sort of.
---
also what about a rate of fire EWAR module, so in small gangs or solo you drop your enemy's dps down
---
Who cares. Everyday i log in the player number count is lower. Its an Exodus, and all the loot boxes in the universe wont stop it.
---
CCP jumped the shark.
---
It depends on which combat sites you want to run
---
Tutorial should encompass all mechanics that dictate combat. Just figure it out bro is fucking retarded.. depriving new players of the basic physics of your weaponry isn’t making it hard mode. It’s just being idiotic.
---
Yeah when I was theory crafting this seemed to be what was optimal too. Expensive pod + being lucky enough to do spawn a 0.1AU warp. The ship itself is largely irrelevant if the rat is already at 1hp.
---
This competition is the perfect combination  of pay to win and rng that defines EVE... for better or worse.
---
They're also in the dictionary, chief. In any case, my amended statement above works even with your chosen definition of "chance".
---
Honestly what ever gets me the most breadth of options. I am not setting out to do something specific, so much as see what it is I can do. Does that make sense?
---
What were you thinking, buddy? You say one sentence to this guy and he'll still manage to misinterpret 70% of it. 6 paragraphs including links is a recipe for disaster. :p
---
No.  Target (angular) speed is a variable, it changes, and that's why you need an indicator of what it is, and some sort of threshold on the guns that you can easily compare to.  Rad/s vs. rad/s.  Especially since what you can do to "compensate" is control your orbit / speed.  It's like having a damn speedometer in a race, it's essential.
---
Sig radius, sig resolution, these are things you can "prepare for" in station, and not really do much about when you're in space and haven't prepared.  Frig-sized guns and going for frigate targets?  You're good.  Cruiser-sized guns and going for frigates?  Better install a target painter, webifier, etc.
---
I don't need an indicator in space to remind me I forgot to prepare before docking.  I know that already, **when I see what ship type they're flying**.  The ship type is enough of an indicator.
---
This is why the change was annoying.  It muddied up a clear indicator for something we could "fly better" to compensate for, in order to add an indicator for something we don't need.  Because everyone learns to recognize ship classes for PVP, it's the first thing  you learn (by necessity, too).
---
Asset safety should just not be in the game.

Depending on the type of ticket you can expect it to be longer or shorter.

If you can't kill a dread with a BS fleet, you're doing it wrong.

You made a good decision, mining in hi sec is a great source of fun and income.
---
CCPlease, update the overview please, thanks.
---
Check the launcher for a panel called Skilling Spree and take a read.
---
I think there should be a single timer, but if it's unfueled it should be no more than 48 hours.  Non-fueled structures should also act as Flex Structures in terms of tether and repair.  Graphics for the hangars should be dark and gloomy with an almost abandoned appearance with lights flickering on and off to indicate no one has fueled the structure.  Without the fuel the fusion reactors which power the citadels are offline, therefore, only minimal lighting should be available.  For the outside the landing lights which extend outward from the structure should flicker at random times and be much dimmer than normal.  Make it look like a real abandoned structure which hasn't been fueled.
---
A presumption requires reasonable grounds or probable evidence. It was an assumption.
---
The point is that if I design a system in which you lose 9 times out 10 every time, that is NOT random, and no amount of you trying to finese the meaning of the word will ever make it random. You are wrong, period. And I will argue and fight you till the cows come home.
---
oh i not refering to B-wings there.
---
i refering to Disney's star wars "first order" ships having shit all for point defense....VS AN ENEMY THAT PRIMARILY USES FIGHTERS.
---
at least the Empire had a good number of point defense guns on their star destroyers
---
and you can kill a dread with a BS fleet,  but you missed my point.
---
a dread can hit a BS.   so while both a bomber fleet and BS fleet can kill a dread.
---
a BS fleet is far more likely to take a loss or 2.   on top of that the BS fleet likely costs alot more for the same ammount of DPS that a bomb fleet puts put
---
I really like Venal - it connects to a lot of places, has some nice pipes if you want to hunt gatecampers/be the gatecamper, there are some stations but not so many which provides risk if you're trying to drop loot off. It's a fun little region.

This might not be unfueled. Notice OP left out which timer this is. It could be hull timer which is 100% decided by the defender AND forces low power on the structure. We had a hull timer of 12 days before on one of our FW structures.
---
It's funny that in EVE the fear is that you will be tackled by mostly tiny ships.

The opposite of most RL tackling.

Good stuff! Cinematically, the cut to the final clip and the ending were kind of abrupt/jarring almost like the video stopped/froze.

Hey, at least you got a system out of his panic.
---
not sure what gave you the impression I didn't read it? The paragraph you cited is kinda what I am getting at. It is a problem if people (like you?) in their mind think that randomness is equated with fairness? It is true for a very limited set of definitions in an area of mathematics and there it makes absolute sense but its not true when most people use the word in their every day life. There are great examples given there as well if you want me to cite as well:   
---
"One meaning: Something random is either unknown, unidentified, or out of place.  
---
Example: My father brought home some random strangers he found under a bridge.  
---
Another colloquial meaning for random is odd and unpredictable in an amusing way.  
---
Example: My social life is so random!"
---
Don't mix a games statement with some definitions of one specific field of maths and then give people the impression you are creating a greater truth?
---
You can just anchor a Astra with instaundock just off-grid, then use a Ascendancy Pod Cynabel ( assuming it warps fastest due to fitting hyper lows)
---
I don't think it's the focused void bombs that are tipping the scales for Bombers Bar. Maybe it could be that they have a whole fleet of people shooting one lone ratting/mining capital? You could do that with about any fleet though. Hell, I could take a fleet of Talwars and erase a capital ship.  Could I then make the argument that because I can take down a capital with \[insert ship\] that it's balanced?
---
the low powered medium structures ( due to fuel not damage) should have a stront timer if they fueled it with stront up to 36 hours.  Give the defender a chance to save it if they filled it with stront otherwise then no timer.
---

We can keep doing this dance all day, but ultimately your belief that I'm "wrong" is a product of your limited mental faculties and your refusal to accept that your whole position breaks down outside of this one specific narrow mindset you've arbitrarily decided is objectively correct. That's your problem, not mine. x
---
cost of the fleet vs what your killing with it.
---
and sure you can bring a whole fleet of talwars.  but most people would notice that moving around.  while with bomber you can black ops portal stealth bombers straight into a system,  warp while cloaked.    and even if they bring in FAX.  Focused void are going to deal a pretty nice hit on them,  followed by far more dmg, with far less ships.  than with talwars.
---
thats assuming the talwars get in.   titan cyno would be seen.   and gating would be intel o'clock
---
Its not the regular caps that are really the issue, its just supercaps.  I am all for anything to deal better with supercaps specifically.
---
Strongly agree... Makes no sense that an unused structure that's not being maintained can still provide the important stuff to people. Just let it die outright.
---
Never trust CCP

T3C are doing better in DED sites unless you want to spend 2B on your stratios.

---
&gt;I am trying to put a fit together for the Loki, but in the meantime would you recommend something?
---
Regular caps, probably, but I think they're actually a good idea when it comes to supers/titans. Otherwise I'd say your comment is on the money.
---
If you think about it thats a really cheap 2.5m sp ahaha
---
oh come on falcon, at least let the guy enjoy his tinfoil hat for a few hours before you mercilessly crush it ;)
---
i miss skill urself they were a great group of people and i really love them #ingme4ever (✿◠‿◠)
---
No 
---
     - CCP_Falcon (probably)
---
Except the current number means actually nothing. You can't, in your own words, 
---
&gt;look at the stats and make a decision on the numbers that are displayed. You shouldn't have to look up formulas and do math to do something as basic as comparing the tracking of two turrets. Especially new players won't even know the tracking formula.
---
So now instead of having a number that puts you in the ballpark with some on the fly adjustment for signature differences, you have to take the number and figure out what other random number equates to the target's sig/velocity. And at no point is this arbitrary value explained to a newbean.
---
Tengu is the T3C usually used for combat sites since missiles can't be out-tracked. I don't think a ever saw a exploration tengu but missile Legion well
---
Very sneaky bomber fleet. NPSI with 25% Spies :honk:
---
im too poor to buy windows I know
---
A max DPS bomber only puts out a little over 500 DPS, about half of what a BS is capable of. You can include bomb dmg, but that's short initial burst damage. 
---
A BS fleet would likely have logi, so hopefully wouldn't lose ships, but they're harder to move around vs bridging bombers in, so you have that drawback. 
---
Bombers can't be tracked by a Dread, but fighters and drones are another story, and bombers pop pretty quick.  A brief scroll through Zkill for bombers and you can see that when responded to appropriately, bombers can get wiped fairly quickly.
---
i see a shield avatar there wtf
---
Your comment reminded me I wasn't crazy and it existed, so I did a search again. Finally found the comment : https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8f237l/undocked_april_2018/
---
Dread alt and flying logi, i like you already :)
---
hmm unfortunetly not currently trained up for the tengu. Guess I'll have to look at that then
---
In naval warfare bombs/torpedoes rarely hit for two main reasons.
---
* carriers an other large ships are capable of some pretty remarkable evasive maneuvers. The combination of necessary steady vectors (to prevent the bomb/torpedo flying off in an unintended direction) and the velocities involved means they dodge very well.
---
* For a plane, bombers are big and slow. Carriers use Interceptors to start bringing down bombers at a distance so few bombers actually get into a position to make a bombing run. Interceptors are medium range light anti-aircraft planes.
---
In your beloved Starwars (and many sci-fi shows) large space battles (or any battle, ex. game of thrones) are staged to entertain and often make little to no tactical or practical sense. In Eve not many ships correlate with the naval ships they are termed after. If you want your bomb to do realistic damage then everything will have to follow suit to match. In terms of visibility both to the eye sand scans. No special jumping around a map. Larger ship with the very real possibility of being destroyed by fighters before you can fire the bomb off. Oh and of course real physics that make putting a bomb where you intend very difficult.
---
My dumb ads would've never thought of that.
---
ok so your point is?  a battleship, which is several times more expensive than a bomber,  is doing its job?
---
i've still yet to see justification for higher dmg bombs.
---
I petitioned the last ball of depots dropped outside Jita 4-4, got a response on the petition and nothing was done about them.
---
You didn’t understand my post at all...
---
That's a great way to win...but I think that shows how poorly conceived this event was: the people who need skill points the least (someone who can casually buy/build and drop an Astra on short notice just for lolz) is going to win the points. I doubt they'd even notice a few days of training injected. 
---
New and mid-term players should be able to get these points.
---
Nah, bombers are already anti cap enough. Just dont be retarded with them and caps become EZ PZ kills.
---
Nah just make super/titan expensive or use fuel to fly around, shoot and we are fine.
---
I see your point, just don't agree with it. Launcher hardpoints on a rokh are a bad design idea and should be removed. Not many ships give you a choice between fitting turrets and launchers and those that do (like armageddon and prophecy) typically don't have a bonus to either. Ccp already tried to let naga use launchers and soon removed them from the ship because they were useless.
---
Well you didn't use any useful words to explain yourself, so...

The only thing that can reliably kill a super is a dread bomb, more supers, or a titan.   Titans have the same problem, yes a dread bomb large enough can kill a titan, or supers dropped on a titan can do the job assuming the titan doesn't light a cyno for help.   What I think the OP is saying is, we need a sub-capital that can, in say a small group (20-30) take down a Titan regardless of the cyno being lit.  Supers and Titans basically have a pretty safe time of it.  Make the "B-Wing" for lack of a better example, fit a module that has a short distance and strength cyno jammer (say 20km diameter?), make it capable of hitting and killing supers and titans but little else.  It's CCP let players control the capital population.   Call it "capital management" or "pest control" but whatever it is - capital pilots have it way too easy.
---
grabs an alt gets a killright sells it for more than the ship is worth people pay he makes a profit
---
No, this is only a timer.
---
You... you're good, you. 
---
You're good.
---
Bombers do half the dmg of a battleship. Avg cost of a fit bomber is 60-70mil depending on fit. IF ti takes 2 bombers to equal the DPS of a BS then that's \~130mil for equivalent DPS. An average line fit null BS will run you maybe twice that. So it's not "several times more expensive." 
---
The bombs aren't what is killing the caps you're referring to. It's a fleet of cruiser level DPS ships that are bringing it down, which I pointed out could be done with any number of ships. Bombers are just easier to move around due to being able to bridge them.
---
my pi alt had the 50k yesterday

When you lost a station in old nullsec you were locked out of your stuff but it didn't blow up. You could recapture the station or firesell the items to the new residents. Sound familiar?

Tracking stat \* target signature radius / 40,000 = tracking in radians/second.
---
ALL OF SKILLURSELF, I wish , it was just p3ak down by you to harass you and do a little thing called pvp
---
you might want to look at the specific battleship fits and costs.
---
unless your going mael/tempest.   the general cost of a battleship is 120m to 140m.  before module costs.
---
and if your going t1 fit. your likely not going to be doing double the dmg of a bomber, unless your blaster fit.
---
also, another thing for battleships.  is the talwar explanation copy pasted.
---
you can't covert cyno,  you can't covert cloak,   and intel is gonna love ya.
---
but hey, if you want a stronger bomb. then your gonna have to argue with CCP over how Naga should get torp/cruise missiles.
---
it wont happen.  cause "balance".
---
I haven't got a single 25k or 50k since the beginning of this. It feel terrible.

Lights won't skullfuck a ceptor, just force it off the field, but a flight of Nav bonuses Valkyries will in fact produce an acceptable level of skullfuckery.
---
You got bad rng, i also only got 10k on the char i needed sp.
---
A module that progressively slows down the target's rate of fire as it ramps up
---
Yeah, that's kind of the point I was making. A solo capital is easy enough to kill with about anything. Once you start dropping hordes of them then you get the "death ball" where it's basically impossible to do anything other than drop more ships than the opposing group. 
---
Bombs would allow you to project a fair amount of damage to a large group to encourage more tactical styles of deployment and discourage dropping 100s of Titans/Supers/Caps on a single Cyno and just cap blobbing. The bombs don't need to insta-pop them, which seems to be the false dichotomy that's being argued, but they should be able to contribute a fair amount of damage over successive bomb runs to not be ignored.
---

wow, I get that your reply got upvoted by fellow players, but hear me out as developer - that's the whole point of open-sourcing the code, so that vulnerabilities can be brought down to 0.

Reply from /u/DaltsTB mentions some type of vulnerability with reactions, that **went unnoticed for year!** Now ask your self, would that still be an issue if the POS code was opensourced? Everyone would know about it and it either would have been fixed, or everyone would be abusing it, which would make it another feature of the sandbox.
---
Making some of the mechanics open to a wide public is actually how it makes easier for the players to understand the rules of the game!
---
yonis is a good man (◕‿◕ )

Give that man a job

Yes please, just any subcap that could be used to deal with supercaps better (although I think it should have to suicide to do it.)

Fear the almighty 50km smartbomb &gt;:D

concentrated a little too hard.
---
Found a link to a story at the time

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.engadget.com/amp/2008/12/11/rumored-four-year-multi-trillion-isk-exploit-in-eve-online/
---
Yup, it's either 3 magstabs or 2 magstabs and a repper. If you have to turtle a reload or something, the repper gives you about 9k ehp in defensive, so I prefer that over 12 dps.
---
And here we have the *some*.
---
Thing is, they don't know themselves what is which exactly.
---
They're not that organized with legacy code.
---
And I think, as a guy learning software developing and thinking of programming games in the future, that my code is more important to me in a for profit game instead of having all vulnerabilities fixed.
---
In a free game? Sure, make it open source if you want to. I don't agree on making things you worked for to get money basically free to copy.
---
Yes, the difference is that if it is open for everyone, than you can't be the only one exploiting it, which does not give you any advantage. And when it becomes known for a massive public, it gets fixed much faster, than if it was being exploited by a single guy, for a long time.
---
I rather enjoy doing the same with a bait Rattlesnake. Especially one with six neuts. 
---
The good old Suckstart Special can kill most small Blops gangs pretty easily, to say nothing of a poor solo Stratios that thinks he's got *you* tackled right before the scram and grappler fire up.
---
CCP removed launchers from the naga because they were too strong, not too weak. They had a weapon damage bonus (unlike the rokh) and 8 launchers. They were out dps'ing the Talos with good application.
---
The Rokh would NOT be bonused to missiles the same as the geddon or arbi, it would still retain the hybrid optimal bonus. It would essentially turn into a combination of a navy raven (8 launchers) and the scorpion navy issue (shield resist bonus) when fitting missiles. 
---
Tyfi and scyfi can fit both weapons (bonused). You can put missiles or guns on a scorpion (only 5 of either though), the tempest has 4 launcher hardpoints as well (no one uses all 4 though because its better to use the gun bonuses), though sometimes youll see them use 6 guns and 2 missiles. There are numerous ships with unbonused launchers or turrets, its up to the pilot on if they want to use them.

Uh random in no wise indicates an even distribution of possible outcomes, in fact the very opposite. It's entirely possible to have a fair coin flip come up heads 8 out of 10 times without that distribution affecting the distribution of future results, which is why it's called "random" (see also: "gambler's fallacy")
---
(✿◠‿◠✿)hopefully gonna have a chill weekend of taking it easy and relaxing with mah dude, some cooking, video games and finishing up re-watching the expanse (✿◠‿◠✿)
---
(✿◠‿◠✿)hope you guys all have an amazing weekend, and that everything goes well for you(✿◠‿◠✿)
---
Rattlesnakes are probably my favorite ship in the game because of this. Everyone thinks them so juicy and then the suck starts.
---
CCPLS why there's still reinforcement timer on mobile depot? I see nothing but abusive use on them.
---
Let em give heat damage to a power group based on script.
---
No idea what a JDAM is, Don't wish to put thought into figuring out the acronym. I'll just assume you won whatever point your making.
---
Just to reply to reddit post saying "no" with a ccp label on it.
---
Ishtar can use 5 heavy drones, Myrmidon and VNI cannot. That's a very significant difference in DPS and ratting ticks.
---
a) [This is wrong](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/24/viral-image/viral-post-gets-it-wrong-extent-slavery-1860/).
---
b) This is a joke about a video game, why are you even bringing this up?
---
I mean there's also the good old RHML 1300 DPS fit, operating under theory that most things are not going to tank that much damage when forced to sit perfectly still. 
---
Generally that's true. Even T3Cs with XL pith boosters can pop from a wrecking hit with that kind of alpha going out.
---
UI suggestion: black, white and red are tough to read all together. Try and find a color palette
---
I'm not at home right now but some of the big hitters are things like: Amarr Dread and Carrier 5, Caldari Dread and Carrier 5 (Gal and Min are at 5 already), Rorqual skills, Precursor BS 5, Precursor Large Weapon 5.
---
I every once in a while throw in some low level skills so I can feel like I'm making progress but at the same time I can fly basically anything I want so I'm not waiting impatiently for anything either.
---
At this point, I think my real job isn’t much different.
---
should have called them 'Chains' imo
---
run-dmc hp bois
---
If something like a raitaru applying its sub-single-bs amount of dps is an issue to the attacker, they probably shouldn't be attacking any structure let alone one that is actively used/defended.
---
While I was testing some stuff on SISI, I noticed that on a HS gate that consistently has lancers sitting on it, there were now lancers and trigs. I decided to decloak and sit there to see what happened. The trigs immediately engaged me unprovoked in my blockade runner. I had to immediately burn back to gate and jump as to not be killed. This system was not under a trig invasion.
---
Would that still work if I do an item exchange contract in Jita and then use my alt in Amarr to create a public courier contract to itself?
---
You can shoot them well enough. Just need to know what you are doing. Limited engagement is much more dangerous because of reshipping tbh.
---
Victim of the blackout?  Big'uns survive, lil'ones die?
---
Lol. I guess it might.
---
Warmhole space is nice this time of year
---
I've been stressed out about work, having done 3 60+ hour weeks so far,as well as getting my monsters ready for school again. Sitting in comms chit chatting while krabbing, even when some rando loki/bomber decloaks has been helping me cool down.
---
That would penalize thoose who use it the right way ..
---
How about being enable to drop hit at less than 1M km away from any cita, station or gate ?
---
when Injectors first came out, i injected up to 80m on my main. I  spent them on off-meta things like shining up Drone skills, etc.  After 80m, I had most of what I cared about, and could fly all the doctrine things well.  After 80m SP, the draw of injecting drops off sharply.  I bet there are a lot of toons out there at roughly the same 150m ish SPs as my main, since they also injected to 80, then trained naturally w/o much injecting since then.  
---
Just a hunch however.
---

If you're going to try to argue warfare like you know what you're talking about then you really should know what you're talking about. If you don't know what a JDAM is then that calls in to question any sort of warfare knowledge you're trying to insinuate you have. You play World of Warships and all of a sudden you're an expert? 
---
JDAMs are a weapons guidance system. They have a weapons accuracy of 5m with GPS and 30 meters without, can be deployed from small, fast attack aircraft,  and can hit a moving target as well.
---
shout out to Koshyx who rescued me from high sec life when he recruited me from EVE UNI to join co2 in 2017. we parted ways just before the fall of co2 last year when the corp left for greener pastures while i wanted to go down with the ship
---
fallen back into unacceptable conditions!
---
The belt! I'm tackled in the belt!
---
Bye bye lil sandcastle :'(
---
will confirm he legitimately linked veldspar
---
It is possible for a fair coin flip to come up heads 8 out of 10 times in a small limited sample. It is not possible for a FAIR coin flip to come up 8 out 10 times in a large statisically significant samele size.  If that happens then you have some kind of bias/weighting going on (i.e. the coin isn't balanced or how you are tossing it is impacting the results) and it is no longer random.
---
Nice amulet clones you all have
---
I can relate. Hope you feel better. Spaceships help push it out of the mind a bit.

Which bill is Alex on? He owns thousands of slaves.
---
Niiice, really outplayed the guy.
---
I kind of knew that, and came here to post the answer that you probably wanted (what is the minimum %age broker fee attainable for sales of more than a few 1000s of isk) rather than the one to the question you actually asked.
---
Taking my tongue out of my cheek, it happens that I have just now finished computing this using the information at [UniWiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Trading#Standings).
---
Assuming you have Broker Relations V and 9.9 standings with both the NPC Corp and faction of the station you're selling at, the answer I get is 3.005%.
---
If you live in a class one wh a raitaru, ammo and a battleship should be enough. Just position the raitaru far away from celestials

The guy was a frat tackler who jumped before anyone else and then this happened

Well, that's useless. I can use the timer on my phone

Lol that sounds fun, you got a fit? I need to repurpose my 10/10 snake

Er need some tiericide!

If some poor bastard goes and dies leaving their drones behind, the only humane thing to do is for you to adopt them...
---
inspired by jack1974? fitting because snuff feels way more than PL atm.
---
Good video.
---
Drone lives matter.
---
ignored
---
Its kinda good right now. Best place game has been in 2 years.
---
Maybe a logi recon with armor reps and capacitor transfer bonuses?
---
I wish i at least checked my extensive stack of hangar trash before i buy something new. But i don't.
---
No drone left behind
---
When are they patching in some brain cells for hilmar?
---
so you're saying the other half is basically useless?
---
They had us in the first half, NGL
---
Yeah nothing except the biggest changes to nullsec ratting in years
---
Or alternatively fuck off the stupid no local change and give krabs the false sense of security so you can force fights outside of cap ranges. Not my fault you brainlets never knew how to work around cap umbrellas before.
---
What's your point? Again your using an acronym. If one wishes to make a clear point one does not use acronyms.
---
Regardless, a guided bomb from a plane requires the plane to fly into range. That plane is subject to all manner of interdiction methods during it's flight. Real planes are not invisible. I'm also aware those accuracy numbers are inflated and probably against stationary targets. They do this because they sell them.
---
An aside I have never played your warships game. My knowledge is garnered from history courses and common sense.
---
Why would anyone use a hydra when there are other cov ops. AT ships can exist with factions having the same ship class
---
No, that's stupid. It incentivises being in null as you don't lose your shit forever if you log off for a week.
---
A max DPS bomber puts out closer to 900 DPS, not counting bombs.
---
A spooling mod that gradually reduces rate of fire of target ship
---
The longer you spool, the less DPS they do
---
I’m guessing you all don’t actually play the game and just log in to get the skillpoints and then log off? Like wtf is this timing it bullshit? 
---
If you turned this into how short of a time to stay undocked then I feel really fucking bad for you.
---
Is there anywhere to actually see what the goal is?
---
Congrats, hope you caught the solo pvp bug from it.
---
We wouldn't want to get rogue drones now, would we?
---
&gt;RNG refers to random number generator which is a technical term for the theoretical idea to have a perfect machine that produces uniformly distributed numbers that are impossible to predict.
---
I have a BS in Computer Science.  When I was lectured on making/evaluating a "random" number generator, it was explained how a computer cannot produce a random number, and how computer professionals are to generate a "sufficiently random" seed value to use for our algorithms.
---
A thing either is or is not random, it's binary.  To call something sufficiently random is a lot like saying that something is "very six."
---
That was 19 years ago.  The moment I heard "sufficiently random" I knew it would be a phrase I'd never forget.
---
In that case lmao how
---
yes
---
windsigh confirmed mad he doesn't have those sick dance moves
---
yeah on your main screen, in the upper left hand corner where the the name of the solar system is and where your route appears, there are icons at the top that let you show/hide info. Click the little flag icon, and it will show the event goal.
---
Yeah, i also carry some refits for specific sites and whatnot
---
It's not very narrow in this case; for games with reward tables, the definition of the reward table will typically have more of an impact on what rewards players get than the actual random number generator.
---
For example; if the RNG decides on a number between 0 and 100 (for simplicity), and the table decides that 6-100 on the table all provide the same reward. Are you really at the behest of the random number generator, or are you simply at the behest of the person designing the table? Because in that particular situation, it's clear the table design decided the rewards, not RNG.
---
They have to come from somewhere.
---
That's why I abandon my surplus in space instead of reprocessing them. Let them rebel and go wild for a bit before harvest.
---
I can only assume it's because he's an idiot.
---
His entire comment history is just him saying racist stuff on /r/eve.
---
This. It's not a good UI to start with but changing colours to actually allow the user to read text would be a good start. :P
---
Oh :( My warrior 2's have eaten too much and now they are ogres.
---
100% this. I joined when EVE started it's free to play option (ended up getting omega anyway, obviously) and now with minimal RMT have 2 normal carriers and a rorq.
---
If people think that the super/capital population is bad now with the top x% skil injecting into them, imagine how much worse it will be when 'normal' players skill into them regularly.
---
We need a way to control super numbers, and keeping in theme with the recent buffs to assault frigates - id love to see Tech III Frigates which can be specced into any of tr T2 roles (interceptor, assault frig, logi, or covert ops lie you just described)
---
&gt; Thought people tend to argue that amarr ships are inferior until you have all the support skills 
---
Same for Minmatar ships, some are usable with more time-friendly skilllevels \*g\*
---
Virgin sabre feeders

Better than any of TEST posting though

try scdkeys windows 10 is like $2 by

r/Eve is much harder than the original though. 🤷‍♂️
---
Ohhhh... It seems the novelty of reaching the 100M mark won't be as fabulous as I was anticipating! :(
---
Ohh well, at least most of my 100M will be skill farmed the good old passive way lol
---
A polarized bomber?
---
Well yeah, but that's a low bar.
---
I would be down for a ramping mod that is scripted for either reducing rate of fire or increasing rep cycle time
---
Sweet thanks!
---
You mean the manatee
---
After all, that's were the rogue drones come from...abandoned by their owners they seek retribution for the love so easily cast aside!
---
I'm not going to go through his history but do you consider what he linked here racist? If the numbers aren't false it would seem it's the opposite of racist. If you're not including this post then ignore my comment.
---
are you fucking high? noone gives a crap about that minimal annoyance P3ak tried to do from 46dp.  
---
if you recall there was a little while where Skillurself and scourge. tried to be a nuisance with a few nightmare fleets untill they realised that noone was interested in having them in Immensea, and they went to the good old "Hurrdurr we dont want to fight you when you blob, us just because we are taking your ihubs dosent mean you should tryhard like scrubs" and went home.
---
I’m not complaining they’re not strong enough? I’m just saying the post above me isn’t correct in saying that caps “can’t do anything” if they’re being neuted
---
which roughly comes out as... well shit, +3 attributes for 35 days oh my, thats like, nothing...
---
Yet when you jet cans around a gate to decloak they threaten to ban due to “unnecessary server stress”
---
Fucking CCP so retarded
---
Good job. Now you've caught the itch. My first solo BC vs BC kill is still one of my favorite moments in Eve. (My ferox vs a Hurricane).
---
It says low power = no fuel 😑
---
where is my 50k reward you frugal fuckers?
---
It's why I always scoop or destroy them, don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night to a mad hobgoblin trying to break into the station im in
---
Wardec mechanics brought up in patch notes, no fix to the exploit of letting a war not count as a surrender if you opt not to pay the bill.
---
It rather undermines the intended changes to "allow the defender to fight back", and i guess it'll stay as a "declaring party controls the engagements" permanently. Deccers can destroy defender's structures as they please, without letting the defenders take out the deccer's structures. Not very balanced.
---
Plz moar loot crates
---
I been salvaging wrecks since my early days. kept it all for almost 8 years for when the day come i would be ready to start manufacturing.... finally, we build a sotiyo in our WH system. I start to have a little prod going on... Sotiyo gets blown up 3 months after anchoring... oooh i did save my salvage and everything else  but  i sold it all and my hangars with unused materials lying on the floor shall be filled nevermore...
---
Yeah, pretty fucking clearly racist. Obviously. It implies both that slavery was no big deal and that white folks are the big victims of racism at the same time.
---
Jeez, arguing with racists is like arguing with bot-aspirant miners.
---
No, when something is at hull timer it is forced in to low power. Do you not own any structures?
---
All the corpses go to the freezer on the hangar.
---
&gt; A lot of P2W games out there use this sort of "RNG" and in those cases you can't really blame RNG because the random number has very little to do anymore with what reward you get.
---
I hate to break it to you man, but semi-randon mechanics in most games (both reward based and not reward based) work this way. This is how exploration loot works, how Trig loot works, how wrecking shots work, how rare item drops from any game ever work, etc. Them being weighted doesn't make them non-RNG reliant and trying to tie a free event where you literally can't lose to P2W mechanics makes you look horribly ignorant.
---
Was there anything in that vid that *wasn't* j-space?
---
Because nobody says the whole fucking phrase and it is commonly known by its acronym.....even to the layman
---
JDAMs have a range of approx 28km which, given the scale warfare is currently fought at, is fairly significant. 
---
We currently have stealth planes which are fairly invisible to radar. Given that Eve takes place in a fictional, extremely futuristic, dystopian universe, I think there's room to allow for stealth systems.
---
I would say join a newbie friendly wormhole corp so they can teach you about how to live in a wormhole first. And then when you are comfortable in your wormhole knowledge, you can go and live on your own if you want.
---
All that for a drop of attention
---
This is indeed a time of chaos.
---
As opposed to what? The names you have gotten used to?
---
Honestly, they don’t have to be T2s even
---
Iunno, I didn't claim blackout killed it though.
---
I am a avid rescuer of abandoned drones.
---
Most drones are re-homed quickly, I keep as many that I can in the drone bays of my ships, someone even left a beautiful Gecko in my home system.
---
Real question: most abandoned drones have a corp ticker on them, but sometimes I find drones with NO TICKER, anyone know how this happens? I’ve tried manually abandoning them, and warping off and coming back, mine always have the ticker.
---
Hey friend, have you submitted a bug report for that one? If so if you could provide the EBR number that would be great and I'll take a look!
---
I started off nomading in c3's and c4's using a Vargur and a scout alt. Obviously you don't have to invest that much to start but I learned a lot just nomading through wh's.
---
who do you feel appreciative of this friday flacon? (◕‿◕ )
---
One day my stockpile of corpses will be rewarded, once CCP introduces corpse reporcessing (a chance to salvage implants from the corpse)
---
I feel this, I always forget my drones out in space
---
Ah yes. The highly valuable home defense C1 Battleship. It’s surmto give you a combat advantage since nobody else can jump Battleships into a C1. They’ll just have to use T3Cs or Battlecruisers that can’t compare with your mighty Battleship. It will be able to clear C1 Sites too for less ticks than a VNI.
---
It doesn't say any of that though? It's saying blaming individuals for what a minority of that group did is not OK. You don't blame every black person you meet for what one did to you five years ago. Why should people blame those alive today for the actions of a tiny few who are long dead? 
---
Talking to those who virtue signal without thought is like talking to a dog about why eating shit is disgusting.
---
I literally meant you didn't explain yourself in the slightest. I guess now I see that you're just doing the #bittervets thing though so bye!
---
Oh I forgot you can’t have bs in c1
---
I was just thinking of selling a few hangers off at half price...
---
My first solo bc fight was a naga vs Harbinger + Gnosis. Naga was brawl fit. Duel web, scrams, neutron blasters and maar with hull rigs. Was a hard fight. Naga wasn't built to fight in such a way lol. But I enjoyed it. They were just ratting so it's not a big win. I got through the gnosis before he even knew what was happening but the harb was quick to lock me up and start shooting. I was burning my repper and it ran out of paste but it lasted just long enough to finish the fight and get me the kills plus their mtu and the harbs pod.
---
Cool video, by maybe you should have posted it on July 8th when it was recorded instead of August
---
people just can't understand our triglavian swagger
---
Yeah, I planned doing it with a Dramiel like this  [https://pastebin.com/SXcFUEaQ](https://pastebin.com/SXcFUEaQ) 
---
Then Astra on an insta off grid, Vindi-web a frig rat, get it low structure with another frigate, then do the run.
---
But then I realized thats alot of effort for a amount of SP that I wouldnt even care about, so besides competing for the heck of competition there really wasnt a reason
---
maybe that could be a thing if we go forward with the drifters lore
---
If you want to sit by yourself and grind at some mind numbing and repetative task in complete safety in exchange for a small and steady exchange of currency, I would suggest you seek out employment at a factory. But... If you happen to see me and I steal from you, you should think of it as part of the game. I'm not playing solo. We are doing sites together. You and me, friends playing together. The triglavians are really just the background. Like the chess board, or the waves at the beach. The real game is what you're playing with me my friend. So when I "steal" from you, what you should be doing is thanking me for spending my valuable time to play this game with you, and making your EVE experience that much more fun and interesting.
---
I would pay rl money for a one time asset relocation.
---
Would you be able to share the source so that others could run this locally? Some might not be comfortable storing their production data on a server, especially since I was not able to find a privacy policy on your site
---
If some1 would edit their video, to speed it up by say 10%, would the judges even notice?
---
Kids drugs are also wrong, drugs are bad for you, so send me all your drugs!
---
Nope. Just trying understand the thread and you aren’t shedding much light on it. I made my hypothesis and you come back with incorrect assumptions. Nice job buddy! &lt;3
---
Maybe something along the line of a focused bomb a la void bombs that can practically speaking only hit caps or stations.
---
AOE DD through cyno
---
are you retarded or just being dense on purpose? CCP were running a competition to see who could complete one of the challenges the fastest with video proof ...
---
Nothing for super balance this time around :(
---
Yea I did. Gonna go to stain tomorrow and hope I catch something
---
Thanks. That’s the info I needed. I’m pretty dense, but also on my phone so didn’t have the ability to look at launcher.
---
It hurts their favorite playstyle.
---
Invincible until engaging hunters
---
Almost any ship with a probe launcher, Astero/Strat/Venture are my daily flyers.
---
Best way is to join a WH corp.
---
Best things to do are explore, huff gas, shoot at explorers, kill sleepers, and following the chain to find more. But you can literally do anything, mine moons, go on NPSI fleets, whatever.
---
Any type really, you need to get used to traveling the chain, a few people will exhaust a single system quickly, stuff respawns slower in jspace. Look at living in a wormhole as living in a dynamic wondering constellation rather than a single system.
---
NOTHING should be allowed to be anchored in Jita 4-4, not even a damn MTU should be allowed.
---
If you do this make it sobombers can’t solo hunt subcaps, use cloaks, AND have this capacity plz
---
Using explosion radius would be the easiest way. The formula for bomb damage is a pretty straightforward , simplified version of the missile formula. Ships with a smaller sig radius would get less damage. So by making the explosion radius high on these bombs it would make them apply full damage to capitals and low damage to subcaps.
---
you the man
---
I like lvl4 missions myself, reliable, safe income, but horrible boring. Just find an lp store with good value, generally the 5 run faction mod bps are good valie and sell well. They do require tags for the lp conversion, so youll want to put out buy orders or youll pay a big markup.
---
There’s already threads asking for a button to automatically target/teleport to/delete the nearest supercapital
---
Bombers are enjoying the blackout but holy damn they need to calm down.  Theyre already invincible hunters alongside t3s unless they fuck up like sit down.
---
I don't think the NPC corps count toward having a ticker.  So they're probably owned by someone in an NPC corp
---
dunno i personaly seeing trigs  more like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y90yaLFoYoA).
---
Common sense says they are not invisible to radar. Maybe some actual military radar people can chime in on that. A military faced with stealth technology is not going to throw up their hands and give up. Countermeasures, pattern recognition, and the like will be found if they have not already. No, they would not make the countermeasures common information when they have planes to sell.
---
In reference to the game: you have all the tools nessisary and then some to kill capital ships already. If you want a single player game go play one. Be sure to activate cheats for even less effort.
---
Yes, in march: EBR 172557
---
You can do the item exchange at either end. I always have the origin ship to the destination, then item exchange to the receiver, but there's no reason not to do it the other way 'round.
---
delete this
---
I was making a speadsheet for this today at work. Now how am I gonna kill time until I play? Awesome stuff.
---
/me hides collection of 300+ t2 dmg ctrl's
---
I only have 1 system (our wh home)  where I store ALL my stuff except a highsec corpse collection.
---
I regularly haul and manage my assets.
---
Well I guess it's a change for once. Normally seeing the Russians spamming it.
---
You've got lots of options. My first day trips were two of us in Ventures and our comparatively veteran buddy in a combat 'ceptor running gas sites. If you want to upgrade to C2 or C3 combat sites, a couple of shield cruisers and one boss Scythe ought to work pretty well.
---
I spent the last week combining crap from all over the universe into one station.  It feels so good, but I have so much garbage to sell off or reprocess!
---
Nah, I would sell my shit off religiously, anything to avoid a useless pile of junk.
---
Its my pride and joy that all my stuff is centralized in no more than 5 stations at a time.

You can have Nestors...

Yup.

Turns out a lot of people use DD.mm.yy
---
trade in corpses for drifter LP :D
---
You just want pos towers. With extra steps
---
I think the chinese are the only interesting thing that has happened to eve in years.
---
Hi, layman here, I've never heard of a JDAM.
---
Everything to one place, wow that would be something once every 5 years or so.
---
Show us the rest of the structure name you coward
---
Yes without the actual pos tower and awful living out of them mechanics.
---
I’m one of those people with like 3B liquid across all my characters, but then hoards a few hundred billion in assets.
---
I just hoard shit, only taking essentials when I move, then all my bling stuff and random stuff gets spread across the universe.
---
&gt;Check the launcher for a panel called Skilling Spree and take a read.
---
I don't know what a jdam is. I do know you're an insufferable baffon though.
---
Ohh, that sounds right, I saw it on d-scan all by itself close to nothing, c-probed it, 100% thought it was bait, and that the moment I got close a group of bombers, dictors, or something else crazy would decloak and get me.
---
So I docked, stripped a Helos down to the cloak and WCS, warped back, approached aligned to a celestial, and scooped it and warped in a smooth way I’m still proud of.
---
Me and my alt where in that system for another hour and never saw anyone else.
---
I love when krabs leave behind their faction drones. Its like yeah no KM but at least I got your drones!
---
this is a quote from a poster above

[Dal\_Shooth](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dal_Shooth/)**V.O.I.D.**
---
 While I was testing some stuff on SISI, I noticed that on a HS gate that consistently has lancers sitting on it, there were now lancers and trigs. I decided to decloak and sit there to see what happened. The trigs immediately engaged me unprovoked in my blockade runner. I had to immediately burn back to gate and jump as to not be killed. This system was not under a trig invasion.
---
I miss my boy lumio, scourge of PL, Savior of provi
---
i ll have you know it s already happening
---
It's completely normal to have hangars filled with corpses.  Why else would they exist?
---
&gt;I am a avid rescuer of abandoned drones.
---
Back when faction heavies were worth bothering, I made a mini career out of saving them from the depths of space.
---
All this would do is allow for even more bomb spam for killmails, further cementing that the bomber is the most powerful ship in the meta. 
---
You're already nearly impossible to hit, with logi support that's even worse, 
---
you can apply damage to any target due to massed ewar, 
---
have a unique weapon system that nullifies active tanked ships of all sizes and/or does damage in an aoe,
---
Top all that off with being able to warp cloaked... and you want even more? How laughable.
---
I hate my Vega 56 for this reason
---
I don't even know what you are talking about...
---
This is how I got on my first super carrier kill mail in a guardian. It had smartbombed all my starting drones and it took us an hour to kill the thing, so the damage had timed out. Fortunately it had some friends who kept comping back to try and help it escape, and they brought more drones.
---
I don’t know what eve is like for you but when I’m mining in my 10 rorqs, I’m thinking about chinese break dancers.
---
i think the scorp was pretty good on its own when the ecm worked as it did. Now it just needs to catch up with the times, same as the widow.
---
I’m actually the opposite of this, lately at least. I intentionally, consciously don’t keep modules in my hangar, other than consumables like ammo, batteries, scripts, etc. I try to just have ships ready to undock. Makes it easier to move, if nothing else.
---
What is "Something said by most European Powers in the 1800's" Alex?   
---
I'll take "Potent Potables" for 800.
---
hell I bet most people didnt even know about this contest it wasnt mention anywhere I read in the event details
---
Show some pics. Words aren't enough.
---
Not entirely. Bomber fleets are used by major null groups too — Stuka or Goku fleets.
---
hmm thanks
---
It makes no sense to freeze an entire class of ships just because there happens to be an AT ship already in that class. Especially when the game is going through this many changes, and making generally available ships in that class starts making sense in the changing meta.
---
I like to watch the AT as much as the next guy, but I really don't care about it enough to screw the entire player base on new ships just to keep the AT prices unique.
---
I've had them both, but I am also doing them on like 27 characters.
---
Your sample size is likely too small.
---
There should be an asset safety system that requires you to GO TO THE SYSTEM where your assets were lost and claim them in person. No instant invincible mailing of assets.
---
How are you going to be able to protect your krabs from 30-50 Wild Hobs if Concord bans autocannons?
---
Just needs range bonuses on ECM.
---
Is that the right click over the F1 icon? It doesn't seem to show any damage type icons or be in order.
---
Like every other thread of this,  fuck your risk averse playstyle of demanding safety
---
But if it happens ccpls make bombers not able to fly cloaked, kill subcaps easily, solo hunt, AND do this.
---
A super ship that out performs everything at most jobs and can do it safely is ridiculous regardless of how much you love “wh” gameplay
---
oh shit thats a good idea
---
Memes
---
Calling me ignorant is rather rude and uncalled for. Especially given i was pointing out a particular situation and you decided to ignore that and apparently broadened it to "all RNG systems ever". You can make anyone seem ignorant if you just completely ignore what they say.
---
I know full well most RNG reward systems work with a weighted table, but i listed a specific example: very few options within a table and RNG tossing a number. This is what the "RNG system" for the daily task is. Due to the few options and heavy weighting, getting the same lowest-tier task over and over is not to be blamed on "RNG" or "chance" or "luck", since the table is simply designed to give the one thing in pretty much all cases and is very predictable because of that.
---
There's a reason most good RNG systems sprinkle uncommon rewards out with common ones and there's a broader spectrum of options in lower tier rewards; it makes it actually a system based on luck rather than effectively being repetition by design. "RNG" with three options and having everything but the lowest option very rare doesn't work.
---
You may very well be right, it isn't exactly a large sample size, but I do know there have been problems in the past with agency goals that get stuck for players and never progress, and I'm going to be pissed if it is a bug and I am stuck on 10k permanently.
---
I went with those colors since they were easy for me to read, but I will look into some other options. Thanks for the feedback.
---
Have you come to terms of hat you are a hoarder?
---
Are you burdened with modulus and ships you KNOW you’ll never use?
---
Well don’t get hung up on your old habits, send any and all excess to AssetHang, just look at that giant smug face, how could you not trust him.
---
Sending stuff to him is 100% safe, no one will ever know where it came from or where it went, and unlike some greedy people that might would sell your stuff off for isk, I guarantee every bit will be used in glorious battle, or be fitted to a exploration vessel that will travel the galaxy.
---
There’s truly nothing better you can do with things and money you’re not using!
---
I keep one Useful/T2 mods container in Jita, Amarr and at our wormhole. I always deposit the worthwhile but not blingy loot there to reuse it later. I rarely touch the things there and I always end up just buying every t2 stuff from the market. In the wormhole I occasionally list some of it on our market with some markup.  Then I have Blingy to sell containers on two chars in Jita and on one in Amarr. When the prices are good and I have the time I put some of those deadspace/faction mods out for sale. But I still have a few billions worth lying around. Then I have the blingy container in the wormhole that I empty often to my highsec containers. I also have separate drone and ammo containers filled with around 200m worth of ammo, cap boosters, paste and drones each.
---
After these there are the ships, a few for each doctrine, some roaming ships, scanners and the obligatory blingy Loki. The ships usually don't have much spare cargo since they are filled with spare ammo, boosters and refits just in case.  Still I scoop the drones.
---
Brother, same here 
---
Bwahahahhaha
---
Or hell just standings, like with the  pirate mining fleets, if you need to kill drifters to save your structures, and that lowers standings, then someone without structures could totally use drifters to their advantage
---
Any suggestions on the UI(as far as the all over the place statement)? For the process I go through in EVE, its just right. Thanks for the feedback.
---
Ty Horde FCs.
---
 I love it when we try some new kind of deployment or fleet and someone almost always derps on something obvious and you can hear it in the voice of the FCs but they still remain cool and guide us through. Thanks for your patience and tolerance.
---
And yet here you are, riding my racist coattails. Sit down, puta.
---
&gt;This presentation of the situation you are putting forward would fly in the face of all physics.
---
Physicist here. The other guy is right. You are not.
---
Thank you for the info. That is much easier than trying to ship everything myself.
---
I had not thought of doing a privacy policy as yet. I will get on that right away. Unfortunately I have no plans to ever publish the source code. It took a lot of work to build this, and it is going to be part of a product I plan to sell at some point in the future when it is complete. Thanks for the feedback.
---
This is t3content
---
The OP had already answered you lmao
---
You mean all of the rest of the planet other than 1 country.
---
I was triggered.
---
Why aren’t these masks for sale?
---
I swear, CCP needs to get on the merch. What is available is kinda weak.
---
The spreadsheets on the desk top were a lot of work, have to create a new sheet or clear the entries of a sheet for the next production line. The best part about it being a website is that you just go through a process, and each production line becomes an entry in a database. No more making sure the new sheet has the right formulas, or making sure you only clear the cells you are supposed to and not a cell with a formula. Spreadsheets took hours away, while the site brings it down to minutes.
---
No problem. I am new to EVE so I unfortunately have no use for it yet, but I know some players can be paranoid and protective of their isk making methods so I thought I would mention it
---
Thanks for the feedback. Suggestion for killing time, if you think there is a feature missing, and not on the future features list, let me know through the contact form. Any suggestions are welcome, and if you can provide a sample situation that makes the development process go faster.
---
I predict that the next time a trig kills something valuable this appears in gif form memeing it.
---
Rescuing Geckos is one of the most satisfying ways to put your scanning skills to use. I am a proud owner of two rehomed geckos. My new friend was learning d-scan and thought I left my existing ones on grid. That was a fun crash course in teaching him combat scanning.
---
I swear some of my item hangars trigger me, I cannot imagine how bad some others are
---
Yeah I have a bunch of stuff I picked up from rat wrecks. Looting drones is just sensible though, you lose them sometimes and need to have spares.
---
I almost took out a manned, shooting raitaru once with a handful of kitchen sink ships and no logi. We stopped because we got bored.
---
Of course, but I sell off the hoard to make quick ISK for other stuff. It's like spring cleaning every 3-4 months.
---
Problem with game is near perfect intel. Asks for further near perfect intel in place that has it least.
---
Which seems difficult but possible. The thing is it would've been easy for you if you had brought a fleet composition fit for purpose, with logi. ^^
---
Yeah 2 scythes and we would've been unstoppable.
---
1) thanks for this fast post :) 2) Thanks for all who fought with me/ against me 3) obligatory - good bye EvE 
---
I wanted to go with not only one Titan loss, BUT TWO !!! 
---
&lt;3
---
Odd to see someone with a Simple Farmers tag advocating for nerfs to structure spam
---
"Not all Muslims are terrorists" is a racist statement according to u/-space-man-spiff-
---
Nice...
---
I am so glad there are other capsuleers that care like I do, together I hope we find loving homes for all drones.
---
"It's okay to blob as long as we're the ones blobbing"

Shoot corpses at Highsec players... and it blocks their view

Obligatory can I have the rest of your stuff?

---
Long story short, a joint direct attack munition is a guidance package used to convert dumb bombs into accurate munitions that are resistant to weather and can't correct their course in fall.
---
Judging by the comments I bet lots of people ruled themselves out by using dramiels and other faction ships
---
&gt; no force or inertia is applied to the objects for them to do so.
---
This is an assumption, not a fact.
---
&gt;The community fitting feature is now visible to all players with a small selection of new player fits.
---
Time to start whining how all player-made fits are useless and how no one should ever use them
---
Then explain it better than he does.
---
Because he seems to be saying that any arbitrary centimeter of space is becoming an arbitrary inch of space.
---
Which doesn't seem to be happening at all in most space, like inside atoms.
---
sure
---
Thank you, that sheds light on his point.
---
my scenario did not happen either :)
---
Cap chain for the Zarmazd, but in a separate hull? thonk
---
"YoLo" u mean, retard?
---
contract all loot to "saeka tyr" in game please
---
Glad you were only pretending to retarded
---
At this point you could even send me a bil or 2 to pay for my next sub, i'm noob -&gt; Julius Mordan.
---
Would make just a minor difference to your total losses. 
---
Also, mega F
---
Well you're a dumbass, I wouldn't expect you to know much of anything.
---
lmao
---
ty... i ll buy one... when i ll stop being a lazy fat ass
---
and tethering, and any defensive weapons / functions.
---
There's a fantastic GDC slide where CCP notes the learning that "EVE players are packrats."
---
Isn’t that ironic coming from a coalition where a t1 caracal gang comes to fight you and you form for ONE hour only to undock in cerbs/scimis and have capitals on standby?
---
I can’t count the times your guys have ran when there was some chance of a loss for them.
---
-1 for not losing a faction titan in there.
---
Cherry picking is not the only thing you can do with a cargo scanner. I use the cargo scanner to go after the highest value cans first in case someone jumps me in the site and i have to run.
---
Yes, they are very common among groups that are serious about killing capitals.
---
Happy to help :) here's a pic

Loving the late night CAISH fleets hopefully the wormhole collapsing , gate jumping, prop always burning lemmings don't take their toll on him and we lose the 2-8 hours of fun each night lol ... Losing that juicy target to lemmings and collapsing the wormhole other night was rough lol
---
That being said, it's been great to have these fleets goin as USTZ/AUTZ can be pretty dead where I'm at... Last 4 nights think on the 4-5 fleets I've been on we have bagged a super, 3+ rorqs (including a 14 bill rorq+pod lol) handful of carriers, and FAX genocide something like 10-12+ for me lol..
---
I think that habit is a holdover from the days of adventure games with item collection features. I can't get rid of the fifteen different remote capacitor charges I've looted from dead pirates. What if I wind up in a fleet that needs logistics support?
---
That's what me and your mother took last night, Trebek! [Ahahahaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch_hoYPPeGc)
---
Why?
---
Am I allowed to ask for ship fittings here?
---
Well, I've been working towards a Omen to use for abysall space, I've basically copied it from the CCP webpage.
---
Here: https://www.eveonline.com/now/surviving-the-abyss

Asking the more experienced pilots, would this be a good fit for t1 abyss?
---
/ooc okay guys I'm not retarded any more
---
-op
---
tfw you slowly realize it's not an edit and actually a real thing
---
Not really. I buy stuff mostly to use.
---
Some stuff has gotten "lost" in this simply because it didn't end up getting used. Or it's just a simple ship, likely without any fittings just because I thought it looked cool.
---
Nothing wrong with whelping supers, I've got a Hel parked in SUADSTAR that's going gating through Provi one day soon :P
---
thanks !! not only inspired by jack1974, but his videos are really good. i cant say because i was never part of PL, but most ex PL actual snuffians i talk to say that Snuff feels a lot like the old PL or even better.
---
I am saying you behave ignorantly because you apply the terms 'RNG' and 'P2W' as if you were someone who is ignorant of their meaning. You have a small chance of getting a better than normal outcome, *just like* exploration loot, *just like* rare module drops, *just like* loot in almost any RPG or MMORPG ever released. More than that, you can't even buy into the event, it's literally luck if you get a better than average turn out from it and no amount of PLEX is going to change that. 
---
By your definition of 'P2W-like', acquiring Thunderfury in Vanilla Warcraft relies on 'P2W-like' mechanics because it requires luck and lots of tries due to RNG driven rare loot. You created an overly narrow and incorrect definition of RNG for yourself that doesn't work in any practical context.
---
I don't think there are enough drone scoopers for that to be effective bait.
---
Title Gore
---
Look at all the beggars. Unbelievable.
---
If you need someone to look after your stuff so these beggars don’t rip you off, contract it all ingame to Vapor (sort by only exact phrase).
---
Good luck
---
actually i posted it on the 19th of July, 2008 and recorded it on the 19th of August, 2007, but no... we use dd/mm/yy here in my country :) the other way around feels weird... 
---
get a better country mate :)

[It's like an itch. I need it, I want it, I'll get it. Guess I'm full dragon after all.](https://imgur.com/a/ncV9aiE)
---
I don't agree with this, forgetting to fuel your structure shouldn't result in it getting killed before you can even log back on.
---
But a low power structure should not provide tether, repairs or any structure service apart from docking. And if a structure is low power when you first ref it then the minimum time to the hull timer should be 12h like it is in a wormhole.
---
I wouldn't be opposed to this... Ecm drones in fleets got a bit out of control but seem to be in a decent place now, they can be countered with a few brain cells and a smart bomb... But making some of the other ecm drones actually useful would be a fun New mechanic to add to spice things up... 
---
I on a rare occasion use web drones but they only buy you a few extra seconds at best (5 mediums on my lachesis reduce like 20% ish speed I think?) Allows me to split scram/web/long point/ web drones onto 2 targets and effectively hold both of them down pretty well
---
Drone scooper here too
---
Cute little ears sticking out of my Drek confirmed!
---
Dumbing things down is always a bad idea. It's the fastest way to kill an mmo. See: WoW
---
did you guys use combat scanner probes to find it or dscan down the right site?
---
&gt; Common sense says they are not invisible to radar. 
---
Notice I said "practically invisible to radar" 
---
I don't have the time, page space, nor the patience to explain it to you. If you want to look it up you can understand how radar and stealth technology works. It does work though or the world's superpowers wouldn't waste the time or money building planes that incorporate it.
---
actually panizia, when you come back i ll give you a rag legit... no ruse
---
A game about risk taking away every aspect of risk is part of why null sec is just cooler high sec.
---
&gt; When you lost a station in old nullsec you were locked out of your stuff but it didn't blow up. You could recapture the station or firesell the items to the new residents, which gets your isk back but not the full value of the items.
---
It got your stuff back **in system** which is a huge difference to asset safety which lets you magically teleport those assets back to empire space for a small fee.
---
The absolute maximum level of safety that's available should be that your items are somehow magically protected from exploding (even though they wouldn't have been in a POS) and you can go pick them up in the system in which the structure exploded.
---
The homepage has text and tables alternating, without header or anything tying them together. it looks random and messy as a result. Either stick to one side, center them all (image, then text) or at least provide a title or something to break things up and categorize. The various buttons/textfields shown, for example, simply don't look like they belong. Their style is out of place with everything else and they look like they belong to the above, below or beside them all about equally.
---
Also, no clue where the actual tool is supposed to be; the home page only shows "how to use", with the images . Account page just shows "coming soon", no log in or register. :P
---
Even their logo is a copy. I think it's reflective of the sad state of the world; everything is a copy now.
---
I can't believe CCP haven't done something about that one tbh. Whatever your thoughts about low power structures, that clearly violates the entire point of war HQ structures.
---
Have you considered working one hour of your life each month so you don't have to beg, or is it just ingrained because mom and dad begged shamelessly and needlessly thus teaching you this behavior?
---
What the fuck did I just see?
---
&gt; A max DPS bomber only puts out a little over 500 DPS
---
This is just factually untrue
---
I normally like speedrunning as a concept, but this might be the dumbest event ccp has ever come up with.
---
&gt;a product I plan to sell at some point in the future when it is complete
---
Keep in mind eve's developer EULA. If you're doing anything notable, you're going to be using ESI. If you're using ESI, you can not make any profits off the service, demand payment outside of the game, etc.
---
The 10 I think
---
Nullsec is cool because of what's in nullsec and the player interaction. What's not cool is losing every item you own because you had to be offline and couldn't move your items.
---
*grinding teeth*
---
RNG is so fun, it's not like i'm playing wow less and less and eve more to escape a hellish RNG nightmarescape. Thanks CCP for adding ***everyone's favorite*** mechanic to eve online.
---
Nice. I missed the form up with 20 minutes but I'm glad that you got a good fight.
---
Forcing the ceptor to leave grid is a win condition for the ratter so that's fine.
---
I'm taking her side on this one, that just doesn't make any sense to me.
---
Fair enough. Usually people make a distinction when referring to polarized vs non-polarized.  They're not nearly as common as non-polarized bombers though, mainly due to cost and the high risk of loss. Polarized launchers add 100 mil to the price tag of a bomber.
---
Friend, I wouldn't try to make a coherent argument with this guy, he's picked up some stuff because he's played some games on the internet and think that everyone has to know the same things he does about american military equipment.
---
He's just another twat.
---
UwU
---
I looked up the system, looks like it would course correct a somewhat errant bomb to within 13m of a stationary target if had enough time/fuel. It can't do much for a very errant trajectory given it's limited fuel.
---
I was just thinking of the effect it could have had on battles like Midway it would seem we could have done more damage to Japan's carriers but results would have been similar in terms of ability to actually sink them with a guidance retrofit alone. I'm sure the system has made good money in the last 20 years.
---
I also enjoyed a story about old 50's Soviet Surface to Air systems being effective against our steath planes and scoring at least one confirmed downing. ( Pilot survived)
---
Tripwire (and, I think, Dotlan) collects this data and records it. Dotlan's your best bet of existing data sources.
---
There is an endpoint to retrieve the current values for some stats (linked above) but you will have to build up the history yourself.
---
Thank you for the feedback, as a developer I tend to just know what to do with the tool I built, so getting this insight is great.
---
In regard to the registering, does the account page menu item not have a drop down for you? That's where the register/login link is. If the drop down(on hover) does not work, could you tell me what browser you are using?
---
Wow that's cool of u
---
This.
---
It takes 50 torp-bombers to nuke a capital ship in less than a minute. 
---
Ah, I see what OP wants know, he wants to drop a single bomb that nukes a titan. Great plan!
---
Holy shit I have fucking brain cancer now.
---
Dude, am I supposed to feel bad about collecting materiel in this fake universe that I can use to make fake money?
---
I did. The tldr is "not very invisible at all"
---
You can, if you build them inside or ship the hull packaged in a DST and inflate and fit it in your structure. I'm not really sure what you'd use them for though.
---
I think this may just be a case of the rest of the game's graphics outpacing the nebula graphics.
---
I experience the same on my 3440x1440. I'd love to see a HD update to the sky boxes.
---
I thought it was a trap from someone specific who was expelled from the corp, he knew my hours and I even thought he was possibly targeting me personally.
---
Dude was doing a lot with to many alts, after he left I saw his main doing a lot more shooting with a small PVP corp, he was burnt out and I’m honestly happy it looks like he’s having more fun. Sure as hell burnt his bridges with the CEO though.
---
Ew...
---
I tried to d-scan it down but it was in an empty space, wasn't a sig anywhere near by it. so I quickly grabbed my combat scanner and there were two of them and a hammer head. No wrecks. It really was an odd time.
---
I am aware of their EULA. I even had a long back and forth with them about this. They have said the site is to generic for me to need a license agreement with them. This site can help anyone manage their inventory in any game they are playing, not just EVE.
---
Man I do not know how you do it. I'm exactly the opposite. I got 1 mil on my bank account but I could buy a couple titans with all the assets I have laying around.. Then again I keep doing this in every mmo or survival game.
---
Weird that a character who's never been in the matrix is making an 80s commercial reference.
---
would have lived if he had shield slaves
---
Jam their fighters and de-fang them. Keep them bubbled until they want to rage-quit and never drop supers again.
---
Do some work.
---
At least you're using them in ways that you can lose them!! Most are so worried about their losses I don't even know why they bother playing
---

Amen, brother. Every item I find has a story so they go in the box. If i want to get a shiny ship welped I buy mods because they have no story... yet.
---
well, what's the story this time?
---
I hope you are not as stupid as you seem to be.
---
People do do work for no gain already.  Its quite unbalanced.  But its more Titans im referring to than the supercarriers.
---
God they even act like bots.
---
I understand that, still doesn't make any sense to me.
---
Even at all Vs a Meta 4 DPS bomber still puts out under 500 DPS. I have corrected my statement though to more accurately reflect my meaning.
---
Try python with pandas dataframes. Very easy and loads of docs.
---
The JDAM has no fuel or motor, so it's all about the free fall time. The intended purpose is to be given a GPS location, and be dropped from very high altitude I'm a relatively accurate manner, so it can go to it's target and try to directly strike it. It just prevents us from needing to carpet bomb to hit something basically.
---
For striking boats, you'd probably want the nose kit as well, which puts a laser guidance system on it. Then you cout just point the laser where you want it to go, but at that rate you may as well use a missile so you have some range safety.
---
The OP talks about the JDAM like it's an instawin button but it has several flaws all it's own. They are heavy and pricy, mainly they are just a way to use up old bombs in a safer and more accurate manner. Modern smart weapons outperform them.

The paveway II is a great example. The entire 500 pound bomb, guidance and all, costs less than just the JDAM guidance kit, without the laser nose addition, let alone whatever it's attached to. It's more or less the weapon that's responsible for destroying Iraq's military.
---
If you begin to think about it, everything is weird. “One decimal two eight.” In Empire Strikes Back the Galactic Empire is shown to use NATO phonetic alphabet.
---
this could be abused so much... even if you made it for omega, with a fee, and one every x year. 
---
people could just make an alt, pay for time, transfer tons of assets to said alt, then asset relocate your entire deployment overnight instead of having to deal with moving shit around.
---
The only way to make it semi-work would be maybe only usable once per character and your character has to be 5 years old first
---
All 5 meta 4 bomber w/ 2 BCS and meta torps is 498 DPS cold. With 3 BCS it is 560.

As a new corporation owner, I live mostly down in Kador. One of the structures nearby is in low-power. Who can I talk to in-game to maybe get ownership of it? We can discuss everything privately there.
---
Invisible to radar doesn't mean completely invisible. It means exactly what I said, not visible on radar.
---
I dont see an issue here. Could use more people like this.
---
Take responsibility for what you say. This is what she deserve when offending Chinese in politics.
---
Don't forget your New Order of High Sec mining permit. It is the law. Contact your local agent as soon as possible. They are only 10 mil ISK and are good for a whole year.
---
I've lost so many ships because I missed the fleet warp, or I was 2 jumps behind the fleet because I spent the extra time scooping the corpses or the drones 😐😐😐
---
It's best to just avoid highsec mining altogether, because it's the absolute worst thing you could possibly be doing. But, if you really must mine in highsec, make sure to get a permit and ensure you're CODE compliant.
---
You misunderstood, it's not very invisible to radar. The way to detect them has been known for two decades. Look it up.
---
funny you didn't comment this written diarrhea to DanteWT who asked for all his stuff XD.
---
Keep your diarrhea to yourself dummy.
---
Some people use yyyy.mm.dd but ya I guess so
---
Shout out to the boys n girls in the Pocket. Keeping the KB green and being a great resource to lean on as a new pilot.
---
The one constant in EVE is morons gating in and out of 1dq. This will never change no matter how many times people are warned, no matter how many dipshit killmails get pinged out. I don't know why you'd make a thread for this; probably 100 other idiots like you did the same thing today.
---
SASH is trash
---
Gorgeous. Such a beautiful ship. Excellent choice and pretty fine work really! Sell prints :)
---
"Notice me Yonis" was his name shortly before death
---
Fuck yeah. People cling too hard to their virtual assets
---
How should I fit my Occator?
---
 You are correct. Meta bombers are more commonly used though. I have amended my statement to more accurately reflect the meaning. However, I think most players know that very few players can field All V's on any ship. Especially enough for an entire fleet. Holding any ship standard to All V's is kind of pointless.
---
if you would know me you would know that iam beyond retarded space friend &lt;3
---
The side I read talked as if it did have some propulsion but I see by your photo if cannot in that configuration. So it would have changed nothing for WW2 naval battles I imagine.
---
Thank you for you insights. Seems like a moneymaker though. Go US Military Industrial Complex!
---
I basically live in a constant state of dread when opening up my hangar and assets. The urge to consolidate and organize is overwhelming
---
i might have been space rich, but not THAT space rich. atleast i didnt accept a fleet-inv and got warped to an enemy Astrahus.
---
My good friend Erotica 1 was one of the most space-rich pilots I have known, and she made her entire fortune by providing legitimate isk doubling services, until she was unjustly permabanned. There was never any shortage of clients.
---
always. Friendly reminder to VVV that germans dont like to be called "Nazis" and no its not cool, even if anime does it !
---
Very nicely done! I would legit hang one on the wall in my PC room if it was like 40x30 in size.
---
There's a variety called the JDAM-LR I think? Maybe it has a motor? Dunno...at any rate, you're very welcome :)
---
I didn't say logi isn't important, because they are. I just don't think it's even possible to program. CCP does a lot of crowdpleasing, but it rarely leads anywhere, cough Hilmar.
---
currently buying third one. My man Hanzo has a good Ragna-stack :D
---
I saw this on Google play but didnt notice the hud. What a bunch of shitheels
---
&gt; The very definition of random requires equal probablity
---
No it doesn't. You're talking about a 'random distribution' - better known as a 'uniform random distribution' for exactly this reason. Random selection within a weighted distribution is still random.
---
Even if it was fueled, this is too much...
---
Time to enter the warmhole
---
Especially the T2's
---
Hi.
---
The stealth technology today is not the same as two decades ago. China is just now declaring that they have a way to detect current generation stealth technology. Maybe you should do the reading? Or are you telling me the worlds superpowers are dumping billions in to a technology that doesn't work?
---
CCP hates money and could make a fortune off merch if they had any decent items. But their stock/selection/shipping is fucked
---
Skill Injectors aren´t the real problem here, it is the fact that you can dock and store as many capitals as you want without having a char locked in it + excavators made them very affordable. 
---
Skil injectors are a good thing for this game since it gave people the ability to grind for SP, and not having to wait years to be able to fly certain ships.
---
I know some bitter vets think that by being subbed to the game for x amount of years they somehow earned to fly those ships, but if some rich guys throw more money at CCP than those vets have paid in sub money over the years, they haven´t earned the right to fly the ships. Weird logic imho.
---
My point is: get rid of docking mechanics for supers and we might see a largely reduced number of them.
---
&gt; might not be the best time to show her my box of skins
---
TBF Skins are a bitch to sell, and sometimes when they look good and refuse to go on sale the price climbs rather well. 
---
They're even more of a bitch to sell at that point, but hey, at least you can show your 9000% asset value increase.
---
you're not looking at the drone bandwidth, the istar and domi both have 125, the VNI just got nurfed hard, the myrm has 100.  
---
the Ishtar was about the same as a VNI before, abet with better resists and some more fitting room.  It functions very similar to where the VNI was at though.
---
  A domi can do as much DPS to get through anoms, you have a TON of utility to make it a pain to deal with you for solo hunters, but you go really really slow between sites. 
---
Gilas are also an option, can be fit to afk pretty well as well.
---
Hey the corp I join! Let's be honest [at least it's not on jita 4-4 undock.](https://imgur.com/tOiTp3C) Pretty dope offer 200mil upon join, 20mil for every fleet participation double the amount if a CTA, plus another 150mil for staying for a month.
---
This is fantastic!
---
Everything is a copy of a copy of a copy
---
The real question, is how you could afford them :D
---
Organic hobs don't have their gm's equivalent genealogy so it's simple a matter of dronicide choice
---
&gt; A thing either is or is not random, it's binary. To call something sufficiently random is a lot like saying that something is "very six."
---
Eh I don't really agree with that. A pseudorandom algorithm is a lot more random than, say, an increasing sequence, and how close a sequence generator is to true randomness is a measurable property.
---
Having said that, being 'very six' is not an unreasonable concept either. 5.9999 is quite six, in a way that 2 isn't, and is substitutable for 6 in a lot of situations.
---
Well, i saw only tittle so i quickly answered a question where are the most of ppl sorry
---
I guess I am biased by wingspan, but all or mostly Vs for bombers is super normal across members.
---
As the owner of the Rogue Drone Orphanage I always nurse them back to full health then release them in my station so they have enough space to play around.
---
They are clearly desperate.
---
I cant legally sell prints, hell I'm not even sure I can sell the original painting and CCP won't just say I can.   
---
As the IP belongs to CCP they can legally sell prints, maybe shoot them a mail!  
---
Everyone is more than welcome to print their own ofc as long as they dont sell them for their own profit

OP doesn´t understand the meaning of probability...
---
Yeah wild because its shit. Supers and titans can not be killed under fax reps in fleet strength while at the same time being the most effective force at killing subcaps. Anything that cant be killed is a broken bad game mechanic and design.
---
Very nice write-up
---
Or the character hasn't been logged in for a long time. I haven't played in a while and most of my stuff is locked away in the middle of NPC nullsec. What an introduction back it would be to get my JF blown away the first cyno I do....
---
Overclocker II and overheat prop.. stiletto pushes over 7500m/s use a low end abyssal point and you can take your point out to 40km or so and keep speed up long enough for your backup to get secondary tackle.

No it is not.

Im a full stack dev myself, and have learned what looks simple to me is not what looks good to a general user. I have begun to defaulting to people and websites who have a knack for UI/UX and take their lead. Like you, I know my own tool well, so I rely on others to make it look simple and approachable.
---
Take their lead on text alignment, color palettes and contrast, button shape, etc. There are some standards for links, like most people expect bold and/or blue text, for example. Granted you're writing a tool for a more tech savvy population so you have a bit more freedom, but you might as well start with what has proven to work in the real world. I usually use a bootstrap template, since I figure there's a reason everyone takes twitter's open source css/js.
---
Is it bad that my alt corp has a biomass hangar?
---
I mostly use that stuff to fit ships, if it's edge case bling / pve bling I sell it
---
Dude, every time you share something you exceed my expectations!
---
Cloaky Loki, right behind you.
---
You have no idea.  I have 120 ships in NPC Delve from when TEST was evicted in 2013.  I went out and lost one the other day, RIP Stabber, you fought the good fight.  INIT attempted to give me a good/fair fight, and I'll give some credit where credit is due.

That moment when you catch yourself scooping drones in your 400b alliance tournament ship.

Yep, hitting the plus, putting in game name, selecting Eve from the currency style, hitting submit.  Brief error message that I'm not quick enough to see, 0 games.
---
test is a pretty awesome place to be if you enjoy hanging out with decent people and always fighting on the defensive to save your shit. 
---
you dont get that with other blocs, i love test bros, hang in there
---
Great so the people can produce and "store" even more capitals...we need more capitals!
---
I once found three flights of t2 fighters abandoned in space when I was about a month into the game and nearly broke. Was ratting in a Vexor, noticed them on dscan, and decided to get them because it looked like about 8 mil, which would have been a lot to me. Was a nice surprise when each of those turned out to be a flight of 9 fighters.
---
as a german i call my fellow men nazis all the time in the vidya games. always good for a laugh. if you enjoy some casual racism from time to time you gotta make sure to include your own people for maximum drama potential.

No doubt, I've only learned from the QA team sending things back so many times because they had no idea what they were looking at &gt;.&lt;

Here's a fake website that is running a custom bootstrap template for an example, pretty configurable: https://www.dagusa.com/

Suddenly i feel bad for using Trig ships so much
---
yeah most meta cane fits can get solo'd by a kestrel because they'll do double neuts in the highs and don't have adequate tackle/speed to deal with a frig at 0, kessie don't care about neuts.
---
I don't remember exactly but they used it to duplicate moon resources. I think it involved the old Ev0ke alliance, a bunch of accounts got banned and isk confiscated.
---
Did you manage to nab them all? That would be a really nice early find haha. Good on you for keeping an eye out.

Always remember to conceal where you're from at first when encountering  new germans for maximum effect

When players actually start using non-bloc-affiliated markets with super-low brokerage rates that are located in close proximity to existing NPC hubs, then I'll buy this idea about lowering fees at Dodi/Rens/Hek to draw market share away from Jita.  I've yet to see it, though - I have no idea why, but absolutely nobody uses player-owned markets (even the non-bloc ones) with ridiculously low brokerage rates located right next to some of these NPC markets.  It's a mystery to me.
---
Yeah, Pith X-type LASB, shield boost amp, grapple, scram, MJD, invuln, cap injector with navy 3200s, and as many neuts as you can fit. 
---
Lows are mostly BCS and DDAs with a damage control and reactor control units, rigs are an EM ward and grid/cpu as necessary. 
---
Have fun.
---
NOW DAMNIT!!!!
---
Heh.
---
You're confused. That's just Aridia.
---
Nonsense. Every year or so I dunno my hangars of crap into a JF or two and go sell it off in jita. It’s like a savings account that I don’t steal money from.
---
I trashed her. Damn broad keeps getting in distress.
---
They are supposed to be used for people who to dip into a wormhole and dump loot in for a day or two an hen leave. Maybe don't allow them on grid with gates, and don't allow them to be anchored in a .7 or higher system like the cargo containers.
---
So, it's been 5 months. I don't really play the game anymore, have they even done any balance passes since this post? IIRC it was only new shit with those Triglavian ships and that blackout crap that's really just a cover up for fucked up chat... so yeah...
---
Third time's a charm, right?
---
I wouldn’t say their logo is a copy per se. But I’ve seen a lot of things that just so happens to be pretty similar to EVE in screenshots of this game.
---
Are you expecting them to be skilled players?
---
They’re main gimmick is strategically executed ganks.
---
its almost like there are modules present in most ship nowadays that modify the signature upon activation, you know, like mwds, or being painted by another ship, or so many other things
---
Focused void bombs?
---
Correct, randomized selection is not randomized probability. However people improperly equate the term RNG, which is only the randomness of a number used for selection, to the randomness of the probablity of occurance (the final outcome), which is absolutely incorrect.  The only thing random is the computer generating a number between 1-100, everything after that is bias/weighted and so the entiety of the system is not random, it is biased.
---
Well if this continues it’s time to online some more bots \o/
---
Got the first one, then I had to go for irl reasons so the person I was ratting with picked up the other two. Unfortunately he didn’t even honor our agreement to split the profit between us, and just kept the money from the second two, but I still got like 120 mil from it, which was enough to upgrade to a VNI (that I promptly lost)
---
the majority of players don't really know how velocity and tracking actually works and can't really apply it on the fly, making players doing the tutorial learn it in any way is a pipe dream
---
Well, hoarding keeps the prices high.

Just to be 100% clear, there's no way to teleport items from Amarr to Jita. Someone still has to transport them with a cargo ship, either you personally or a third party service you hire for the job (via courier contract)
---
You mean like in WH? And people are fine with is because risk/reward, but that shouldn´t be the case in null sec, right?
---
New players arent in freighters either.

I got a bling box as well. I know exactly where you're coming from. But yeah if gets to hoarding bags of poo then I'm out too!

just because it used to be that way with stations doesn't mean it should be that way with citadels, it surely wasn't that way with poses. If you want to merge the use of poses and stations into a single structure ya can't ignore both of their characteristics and uses(well, ccp apparently can, but alas)

---
errr, i don't know mate, maybe the fucking gates? maybe the static geography vs one changing every day? maybe mass limits and cyno limitations and so many other things? 
---
do you think before citadels existed k and j space were the same thing?
---
Yeah I managed to get them when they were quite cheap. Sadly I didn't buy more. I kinda love the pirate frigs. I use them mostly to shuttle in between the stations. The other things I'm quite proud of are the micro smartbombs and the shiplogs. Something from the older days. Love the lore on the shiplogs that showed the locations for DED sites when DED sites were a location on your overview and whoever controlled that system had control over the deadspace mods dropped by them.
---
didn't they specify only t1 ships?
---
Come to wormholes. You can already kill a low power structure in under a day.

Ya, players are still going to call them 'slaves' regardless.

That's just another abuse of the reinforcement timer, I see no difference between that and rorqs abusing them to save their precious excavators.
---
something worth a bit more than 1M ISK that can provide 48hr of absolute safety for 3,000 m^3 of stuff is ridiculous. The totally free reinforcement timer should be something like 5-10 minutes instead of 48 hrs considering it's size and price.

Conditions:
---
* You must be in your pod with no active ship to begin the asset relocation submision.
---
* It is an all or nothing request, every item in every station in every container that fits item-type conditions will be relocated wihout exception.
---
* The process of "gathering" your items and transporting them to your current location cannot be executed while under an active war.
---
* The price tag is 30% of the total value of the items being moved, capital ships are not eligble for relocation and if item has no meaningful price history (BPCs, or unique ships, items) , they will not be eligible for relocation either.
---
* The delivery will be completed in 1.5months time.
---
* The transport cannot be delivered or originate in any of these systems : Jita, Thera or any wormhole system.

---
The issue isnt with bombs or bombers the issue lies with capitals being able to cyno in a horde of other capitals. Get rid of cynos. Sure now all ships need to be moved around manually but that opens the options for people to catch these massive ships which will kill a fuck load more of them, but mostly it will just require these nubs to take their time getting to their friends and maybe make them second guess going to help at all.

I have a shinies box, from looted drops of blinged ships. Usually I sell them when I need an ISK infusion and never fit them to a ship because I know I'm just gonna die with it anyway.

Right, let's go on an entire tangent after throwing namecalling into it to continue feeling right and completely ignore the entire point of my original comment or OP.
---
Feel free to continue blaming "chance" when a badly designed system continously gives the same result.
---
Guess your ITT Tech courses left a little to be desired
---
How often do you tell her to put the lotion in the basket? Just curious....
---
thats because "can i have your stuff" is already a well known "meme"
---
Your group specializes in cloaky(bomber) ganking so that would be expected.
---
True ,but citadels also don't really serve much of a purpose in highsec... they're a staging point, a beachhead. In highsec, any location serves as that.
---
Also, you put citadel in caps, but 99% of eve is still using "citadel" and "structure" interchangeably. So when someone says citadel, i tend to assume they mean all structures, not just the one subtype.
---
I have only had 2 25k sp days across 4 accounts and not a single 50k I thought this event would bring more so but seems like I'll get a little over 300k. Random is not fun I'd take 25k each day over a chance to get 50k.

Is this the autism that this game's community always talks about?
---
The problem with anti-capital subcaps is, that while they might shake up big scale capital warefare, they will also massively affect single player capital PvE, namely (super)carrier ratting and Rorqual mining (yes I am aware of the fact that you want an umbrella, so it is not really "single-player").  
---
There are already ships that can destroy capitals fast and being locked in space for 5 minutes is the price you pay for them.  
---
A ship that is allowed to stay mobile while doing that kind of damage would be broken in a lot of ways.
---
Heh. "Know my own tool well"

Yup, still 14 on the inside.

---
Depends on where you live. And it's perfectly reasonable for å student to krab for an hour or two in the weekday evenings so they can plex.
---
Which is entirely too hard to search through so I just buy new off the market all the time anyway...
---
If you belonged to a particular lantern corp, it would be the orange lantern corp (avarice/greed).
---
That will depend on where you want to use it (hisec, losec, null etc.) and how (e.g. are you going to be travelling on your own or with support). A starting point might be 800mm steel plates II, Damage Control II and then fill up the low slots with hardeners (this would be appropriate for HiSec when you are actively piloting and not afk).
---
I will definitely need that one 50% damaged Scorch L  at some point in my life!
---
Shut up shut up shut up
---
But what about my three man corp that can only play once a week.  How will we survive?  Won't someone think of the little guy?

I have done this.

It's a depot, as in, thing to deposit stuff in.

CCP should add a tick box "use items from containers" in the fitting window as a future quality of life improvement

Yes, I'm saying exactly that. Would not be the first time or the last.

---
I love the ishtar. You literally never know how it's fit.
---
Part of what led to me joining Veto back in the day was due to me pretending to be an easy target belt ratting in an armor-tanked ishtar... that was fit out in the midslots entirely with jammers.
---
It was hilarious. I didn't get a ton of kills with it, and definitely died my fair share, but people were always completely taken aback, expecting at worst a nano fit ishtar, and at best, a dumb pve belt ratting shitfit, and then wound up getting permajammed by a fucking non-bonused ship.
---
Thus, we see the fruition of Hilmar's plans for chaos.  Next, Triglavian dehydrated fruit snacks.
---
this makes me moist
---
It has nothing to do with the number of days between reinforcements. The problem lies entirely in the time setting. Clearing low power roach motels and leftover garbage that's set to the ass end of the wrong timezone for you is a massive bitch. Alarm clock for defended keepstars, not the unfueled raitaru of some nobody somewhere or a big blob that moved to the other side of the galaxy.

Just watch D scan and your sig window and you shouldn't get dropped on.

That was literally the point behind the OP's post.

So I've always kinda viewed video games, though my favorite entertainment, as a modern equivalent of the Roman circuses. Distractions and amusements for the me, keeping me from being more useful with my life.

But Eve is touching too close to home these days. Sp handouts. Dancing masked triglavians. There's bread and circuses inside my circus. Wtf?

Browse zkill by region, see what systems kills are happening in, who is doing them, work backwards from there. There's plenty of PvP happening, just because you're used to going to Bloc HQs to get ezpz content doesn't mean there's nothing else.
---
Ok good to know you are experiencing the same, I thought there was some new setting that I was missing or something. Thanks.
---
Pro tip, there never were any bots ;)

Recently syndicate has had some more folks and some of the entrance systems usually have people (the connection from syndicate to solitude).

Actually words describe the issue exactly but to satisfy people like you I’ll see what I can do about a pic
---
More like Age of Fail. The trend towards the downward spiral of logins has begun. Wait until USTZ sees no more than 15k peak. Then will you all admit this was a failure?
---
Why not? You afraid someone is gonna magically evict you out? Also post on the eve forums. They have a dedicated bazaar for sale post. As someone who sells wormholes, J-tags are a must.
---
You're just repeating numbers as if they're meaningful. 15k peak in blackout vs 20k peak when there's untold thousands of vni bots with NEAR2 running, swarming the drone lands. Difference in those scenarios? PLEX price inflation is in check in the first one.

Thanks, it’s too bad because everything else in game looks amazing at 3440x1440.

when youre in a group with large amounts of people, people who you know are ardent PVPrs deciding that its just not worth the hassle anymore and the lack of common sense from CCP, comments like yours calling everyone who quit a useless krab or a bot is downright insulting to our intelligence.   
---
Im a squad leader, a CEO and an FC numbers of people who did a lot of pvp have gone down considerably since the change, the only people it looks as if its empowered is for people who want to do the low risk high reward style of ganking moving cloaky ships around to gank capitals with little danger of being caught, and a lot of people aren't into that being the only thing to do.
---
“Exploit”
---
Keep your stinkin doters off my christian subreddit, badshens
---
Low power structues =&gt; no timer, one attack and gone.
---
If you dont care for your stuff, it should be taken by otheres.
---
In some system are 10, 15 or even 20 low power structures and the owner are inactiv...
---
but if you was to sell him a paperclip and include a free painting that would be ok
---
Yes exploit, because they're designed to be limited to 1 per ship.
---
Delete medium sized structures.
---
From our 1 fight, you are a twat.....but yeah we are in agreement on this :)
---
Nullsec seems to be dying activity wise. We go roaming and kill some poor twats not scanning dscan but we aren't getting many brawls. We have to literally to go near a big alliance staging to begin to pick a good fight
---
Blackout was a mistake, I've seen a couple of my friends cut down on their time playing. Only one has stopped entirely (at least until the blackout ends).
---
I dont mind the blackout, since I just put out T2 drones on my rorqs and fire up netflix for a good couple hours.
---
However, since my friends are coming on less and less, it's hard for me to also come on when no one else is.
---
My buds are lowsec guys so I can't comment but from roaming I agree, null is getting quieter
---
It's got trojans and key-loggers and everything. Just like GSF's 'recruitment' site.
---
;)
---
That is a sentiment a lot of people preach but very few actually follow once they get toys like that.
---
But one of them is enchanted.
---
Instead of blowing it up, CCP should allow you to "hack" or "conquer" a structure in low power.
---
Not like it would change structure spam, but it would make attacking actually profitable.
---
Im not interested in flying stuff that i cant lose without it hurting my wallet, saying that, ive been playing since 09 and no real inclination to fly caps either
---
Good to hear! Entrance systems are good but how is syndicate generally? Last time we roamed there it was dead
---
JonnyUK streams all the time in a bomber that does over 1k DPS as an example.

he was joking, BS's don't give you even a noticeable advantage in a c1

---
&gt; I speak as a lowseccer with no skin in the game
---
So basically you have no idea what you're talking about and are just listing the capital systems for nullblocs in a low effort shit post to whine about the blackout and blue donuts. Gotcha.
---
How did you think this worked before? You go into a region and pick a fight with the locals and when they respond you either fight the response fleet or relocate to gank another hapless target. Ping sov structures or jump gates if they're slow to form, it's basically the Eve equivalent of ringing their doorbell. 
---
If you want an area that's pure chaos come to Detorid. O3- gets half a dozen alliances roll through each day, and the surrounding area is rife with small gangs and solo gankers. Frat are doing an impressive job surviving under the pressure and it's created a beautiful no mans land that blends right into their krabbing fields. Come and join us, the water's fine.

c2 with a c3/hs connection if you're new and want to do your own thing. Otherwise if you're willing to be a small step further into WH space, C4 3-5 statics. You'd always be 1 jump from k-space through your c3, and c3 and c5 sites are the only ones really worth worrying about in WH space, generally speaking.
---
You know, when I first started playing I would haul the largest containers that fit in a Iterion MKV our to my mission system to organize things, one at a time, over many jumps.
---
Only when I started again last year did I learn you can just build station cans for like nothing with a cheap BPC.
---
my lord, what hath ye created
---
You chose low risk high reward gameplay by joining goons, and now you call blackout a failure because it promotes your style of gameplay.
---
Seems Ironic to me.
---
Because there was a time before citadels when Vargur's were the shit for ratting sleeper sites in C3-5 sites with pretty easy fit changes. I made a ton of isk and didn't lose a single Vargur.
---
&gt;\*\*whine\*
---
K bro, k, all cool
---
Detorid... that's where the fun is.. cool... stupid mong
---
Take EVE out of the context, and think about the point it appears you're trying to make, at least from this side--He should not have taken the risk and done his own thing because it's not original and he might fail. There may be a time you will need to go out on a limb and take a risk for yourself, your family, shit even your corpies. Don't be the guy that makes fun of that guy.

 "*With this tool you will be able to see what each item you create costs, and when you sell it, the ledger will show you how much profit you made*."

LOL!! You do realise that 95% of everything on the market sells for less than the materials used? You mean "... show you how much ISK you lost because ur stewpiiid."
---
No

&gt; From our 1 fight, you are a twat.....but yeah we are in agreement on this :)

ditto lmao, it is just pure trash for trying to get a meaningful brawl anymore, ganking gets tiring so fucking quick lmao
---
Not a loki?
---
Trying to summon the unholy GigX?
---
Yes, most of the time it does sell for more than cost, but I still wanted to have this, plus it can be used for more than EVE, not all games have a guarantee that the product will sell for more than material cost, and for that matter, EVE does not have that guarantee, it just common.
---
Thanks for the comment.
---
I have too much pride to be a scammer tbh.
---
I dunno, I have around 1500 losses altogether with alts inc, around 70b (I realize that covers one of those titan losses but I've never been one for grinding isk up and always thought that titans were usually funded by the corp/alliance anyway
---
I feel personally attacked

delet this

Did you know sansha has been providing nullblocks with obedient f1 monkeys for years, its true, really!
---
dont have to wait for them to reload
---
CCP is focused on changes that have relatively bigger negative effects on mid/smaller groups. 
---
So unless you're under cap umbrella, you going to be dead.
---
Wtf has this game come to that this is reddit worthy
---
Well yeah, but its not really practical, having other modules in low slots are probably more valuable.
---
But I guess that might depend on the ship you are using
---
I mean, Tribute &amp; some of Vale has been pretty active, people are still constantly blopsing, dropping and shitting on GOTG in Deklein, andiirc Detorid is still seeing some action aside from the bloc level shit.
---
are you trying to be retarded or does it just come naturally?
---
I think commissions are ok, selling paintings you just made is a grey area ive heard some say its fine and others say its frowned upon, and prints are a no go at all

---
This is a Eve dance, so weird. There is no spaceship.
---
&gt;and now you call blackout a failure because it promotes your style of gameplay.
---
no we're calling it a failure because its fucking over everyone else and driving away content from null, and if you fuck everyone else over long enough we won't have anyone to kick around for fun. Our playstyle will still work, the empire will still stand, there just won't be anything to do for fun besides dropping on everything in lowsec that undocks and burning random hisec regions for funzies.

They already summoned Satan, hes been their leader for close to a decade now

Idk man. Contents not that bad today. Got a wh to delve killed three myrms got a faction titan dropped on us and dipped. Was a good day.

Needs more Titans, Shoulda made a giant Dickbutt
---
5 regions out of 41 have \~some\~ content and the OP is stupid for not being able to find a fight? Go back to your I love blackout echo chamber threads and leave Op alone.
---
Says the wormhole. I have an idea. Let's allow cynos in wormholes as the age of chaos and let's see how dangerous your space becomes. I want to hear the blood curdling screams as every womehiler gets 20 supers dropped on them for no other reason than nullsec was bored with the blackout. 
---
I've looked at dotlan. Even areas where there was not tons botters the ratters sort of stop doing anything. Guess your reasoning still sucks.

in my experiances it all depends on what you want to focus on and when ur ready u'll have to bring bpos for everything if ur doing it on ur own or starting ur life in a wh, but i would recomend that you join a corp that lives in wh space to get a feel of it tthen go live in wh w ur friends if u want.
---
so instead of having supers dropped on them they can just get run over by bling fit T3 gangs from other larger WH groups... damn, that sounds like so much fun for the little guys.

&gt;Delve,
---
idk man your point doesnt mean anything because we found content in the same place you first stated as a place to find content
---
use 3 orcas
---
CCP would rather flush their money down the drain with all their other failed projects instead of finding a company to partner with to produce eve merch they can sell at reasonable prices. I'm not going to spend 20-40$ on some dumb fucking skin for my nyx no matter how many flashing police lights they put on it, but give me the chance to buy a quality 3D print, or metal model of one and I'd be willing to drop the money on it.
---
you guys deserve boredom, the more, the better for you.   
---
Everybody that joined goons/blued them, for the easy life in a mega blob and gate camping titans are part of the problem, you deserve stagnation and boredom.
---
It's a community driven bot. Not intended for solo miners. It would be useless, but if you have a corp, the last guy just marks it as depleted and everyone will know when it respawns.
---
Weren't you gonna quit?
---
grr gon, hat goons
---
As someone who inhabits and stalks NPC null sec for content, I think the blackout is great. I've had more solo fights than pre-blackout. The blackout allows more scope for tactics and bravery, instead of just running every time a new name pops up on local.
---
Oop my bad thought the system you listed after was delve lmao
---
nice random reference, I actually had to google that one, but your point is still shit and the OP is still right.

---
Yup
---
Wow, thanks for the nice thorough answer. At the moment they're working, though not optimal. I'm still experimenting with what I can reasonably get into a fight with, they've been doing the job but my targets have been small and I can tell damage application isn't great.
---
I'll be experimenting with a bit bigger targets to get some more practice and feel for what I can manage.
---
Deklein, branch, venal, tenal , cobalt, cache, tribute , vale, geminate, ER, PB. These are just the areas I’ve been to recently that I found content in. Most of the other I haven’t even gotten to yet . 
---
I honestly don’t know how people are not finding any. I suspect it has a lot to do with the undock button.
---
Well it was locked away but you could still firesell them even if you couldn't dock there, of course you would sell them for less than their worth, which I think is pretty similar to the assets safety tax
---
impossible, the goon dude said that the game's dead and blackout made everyone leave
---
Can confirm, rote Kapelle is super dead.
---
Also, Recruiting
---
Even if Discord didn't have time stamps, you could literally just ping your miners, "ice depleted at [enter time here]". What if no one is online at the time of despawn?
---
Wait wait, for real? It has been common advice for a long time to not turn on your mwd on for example going back to dock to the station cause you could get instalocked from the sig bloom
---
Really? Did you put the lack of content on Blackout? Player migration has been going on for a bit longer than that my friend. Some of us raised concerns about it a long time ago. It has more to do about super alliances mobility across the universe, lack of fatigue, Ansiblex gates, Cyno mechanics, Safety of Super Umbrealas then it has with Blackout. If super alliances could not maintain control over vast regions of space with such ease as Ansiblex gates provide then maybe you would have had some smaller entities trying to occupy some space in nullsec as an independent. But right now that is impossible.   
---
Player migration into big superclusters of idiots have been going on for at least 3 years if not more. The fact that these big players not find it harder and harder to find content is not a surprise. We spoke about this a long time ago. Goons cry now that they lack content lol.   
---
For example. Recently we dunked on several occasion in Impass with some roaming fleets. Almost with every incursion we had there TEST pings their discord and jumps in Titans and Supers and HAW Dreads. Even if Breave response was enough already lol. So mobility creates dominance, stability and lack of content. But if alliances could only reach the outskirts of their region and inter-region travel would require at least 12-24h then conflict in EVE would be completly different!
---
I have over 1800 skins and clothing items. And have zero intention to sell any of them.

i m not really saying that very often at all but this china dude gives me legit eye cancer every time i enter jita. like wtf is wrong with this guy? compensate for some small ancillary china wiener or what?  jesus christ...  i actually deleted mobile depots out of all my overview tabs simply because of this shit. its unplayable otherwise.
---
Right. Currently you're allowed to anchor as many MDs as you'd like. This policy needs to change. The game needs to be modified to prevent anchoring MDs in certain locations, and prevent anchoring large clusters of them everywhere else.
---
Last month alone I had to remove almost 350 MDs from Perimeter...
---
This is going to be nerfed with a month
---
Mastercard
---
Ur stuff?
---
Nonsense. In the time it takes to scan every can you could be hacking them all up. Waste of time and a mid slot.
---
No you did a shitty damage, no bonus, no siege.      
---
It was simply funny.
---
Sacrifices to Bob intensify.
---
I see nothing wrong with that statement.
---
It's primarily been both the Russians and the Chinese (going by language used) for a while now. The Germans also do it from time to time as well.
---
The Chinese players are definitely the most tenacious though. After you blow up their depots for a while, they'll start resetting them every single day to keep them from being removed.
---
pls no... pls let god safe you from that abomination called mining.  can we make a deal? i give you 3m every day and you stop staring at rocks and start playing the game instead? i mean. i wouldnt even undock for 3m because its such a waste of time

dude, if your guns cant track a GATE, you need help

#How to cope on with posts like this on r/eve, an easy guide for 3leet "hunters"
---
* Step 1: Wipe the tears out of your eyes as you look at logins and concurrent players and realise they're down. If you squint you can pretend they're not.
---
* Step 2: Get drunk before a roam, cause it'll make the 45 jumps you have to do to find content blur together into one big jump.
---
* Step 3: Repeat to yourself **THE BLACKOUT IS FUN, FUN, FUN** until you start to believe it. Make everyone on Comms do the same. Kick them from fleet if they stop. Convince yourself everyone who dislikes the changes is a bot, that'll help. 
---
* Step 4: Realise that 1 brick tanked Domi you finally found was a bait, and cry when his carrier/super/whatever buddies appear and do to you what you and your fellow Lokis were planning to do to him.
---
* Step 5: Make a bullshit post including your choice of trash-tier memes such as "adapt or die", "HTFU", or "this isn't ruining the game, it's ruining your game" to fish for validation here.
---
* Optional step 5: Realise you're an idiot and the blackout  removes plenty of content, makes subcap mining/ratting pointless, hurts small corps and alliances more, and makes the cap drops you cry about even more frequent. But downvote this post anyway cause the truth hurts.
---
Well they made a poll not to long ago and asked people what rewards do we like. I imagine most idiots answered Skilpoints. There you go. Have fun now.
---
if they had done one of the other I think space would still be full of people, and yeah some bots.. at least their in space where they can be shot at with a little prep work, but both blackout and vni nerf has killed the game for sooooo many people...
---
No, no.  The Dark Lord Beelzebub is very much not boring.  Hail Satan; but first learn to hail yourself.
---
become a public servant
---
They need to keep the krabbing to fill the warchest that will never see war.
---
You want content? Don't blue everyone near you. Pretty simple.
---
&gt;one 24 hour timer
---
Implying that the timer comes out at the same time it was reinforced, IE the timezone of the attacker.
---
you shot monuments in amaar bc you where upset or simply because pretty colors
---
Remember events when they used to be good? Then we got shit ore and blueprints for the accerelators. Events died, now we just get sp because nobody is ratting anymore. E N G A G I N G P V E
---
Point up: stan
---
Point down: satan
---
Point sideways: Stantanni
---
Six points: Santa
---
That's some premium salt.
---
Literally no one is blue to me or my corp. Content is scarce
---
Spod’ed be thy name
---
Agreed, I have seen much more stealth bomber fleets and lower numbers for roams/pretty much any other fleet.
---
Hmm, people do say that lawyers go to hell. But the one with the wizard hat is the Devil himself?
---
Is content scarce or are you just not good at finding it.
---
&gt;come to delve
---
Right under the cap umbrella? Behind the gate boson titans? Past the flashformed nano fleet that 1 shots me off grid?
---
Delve is boring.
---
You're really trying.
---
It doesn't violate the EULA if that's what you are expecting.
---

---
I could be bad at finding it but you cannot deny how fucki g dead nullsec is. Maybe like 5 regions eith ok things to kill and then the rest are just dead. Idk I prolly am just shit tier at the game and so are all the other people that understand how dead null is
---
Thought I'd compile all the trends I see here in one post. I think it's pretty accurate. 
---
Have you done all the steps or?
---
It's definitely not nonsense. The reason i know this is because i don't fit warp core stabilizers. Instead i fit my helios with 2 nanos and a sig amp so i can target an start scanning as i burn in.
---
No, Rorquals are boring. Holes in asteroids.
---
I almost believe you. 
---
Except I’ve found the complete opposite....
---
Goons: We actively discourage roaming in our space by blobbing anyone in our space with supers and titans. This is our alliance policy as confirmed by querns, asher, bbtb, and many others right here on r/Eve.  
---
Also goons: We're fucking bored, come to Delve.  
---
:thinking: Maybe pick one and stick with it?
---
I just feel bad for all the new players that join goons, only to not resub the following month because they are so fucking bored they would rather play TFT.
---
&gt; Depends on where you live.
---
&gt;  reasonable for å student
---
Right, already taken this into account.
---
On average you're 32 or older if you're playing EVE past 2014, have a disposal income, work and likely have a family. You're probably not a student at 30+ and instead part of the workforce.
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/t/demographics-of-eo/67106
---
Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, United States, Sweden Netherlands, notice anything? they're all in the top 10 minimum wages worldwide minus the United States. That's right, the wealthiest people in the world are eve's demographic, the outlier actually being the wealthiest nation in the world. 
---
Than there's also the fact it's very unlikely you're making minimum wage in those countries if you're playing this particular 15 year old; pay to play, pay to win game.
---
The exceptions are places like Russia, you'll still be old, albeit wearing a tracksuit, but you'll have no money. You also wouldn't read or speak English and be in this thread - as that multi-lingual talent would suggest aristocracy, wealth, education etc. (3 percent of Russians are fluent in English)
---
&gt;makes subcap mining/ratting pointless
---
Why/how?
---
It hasn't changed. Realistically. What changes have occurred are more a product of the geopolitics of Eve and less so of mechanics.
---
You waste less time chasing a bot and people make mistakes more.
---
It's better. We haven't changed our methods and continue to produce as much content as before blackout.
---
increasing rep cycle time adds a counter play to logi that is more than just kill the logi so that would actually be great i think. new mechanics to use in a fight would be great.
---
Killed the game for so many bots ... fixed that for you.
---
detorid used to be fun, now its just gate camps and the people you would usually hunt have mostly moved out, there was a time you could fly through the immensea &gt; detorid PVE pipe and see 200-300 people mining /ratting at just about any time of day, now its more like 30-40 people regardless of timezone
---
so your fear of local prevented you from finding content? Sounds like a personal issue related to fearing risk and not a game mechanics problem.
---
Let me get my popcorn.
---
my god what has science created?
---
" If super alliances could not maintain control over vast regions of space  with such ease as Ansiblex gates provide then maybe you would have had  some smaller entities trying to occupy some space in nullsec as an  independent.  "   
---
Bullshit, Removing ansi gates is not going to stop a large alliance from forming 250 dudes and gating 20 jumps to shit on teh nobodies who tried to take sov in their buffer zone.
---
That wasn't actually a wizard hat, that was just how mere mortals perceive his crown of horns
---
When we were anchoring our first keepstar, I spelled "LINUX" with mobile depots above it. Asher tried to lance it. He missed.
---
So you say "adapt or die", and then when they adapt you say "wait actually don't adapt". You wanted this to happen. You wanted null to adapt, and they did, and now you're whining about them doing what you wanted them to.
---
Read: Unless you're specifically Russian, you're not making more per hour farming ISK in eve than buying it legitimately through CCP through plex. You may be a student, but you wouldn't be the demographic for EVE unless alpha clones/this is eve massively changed to demographic.
---
Offer CCP a flat percentage of your profit (after expenses and income tax). I think the paintings themselves would be more worthwhile than prints. CCP is more likely to let you sell paintings I think, since you can't exactly make a thousand a month and dig into their print sales (if they have any print sales?).
---
Armour booty broke the internet goddamn
---
next year, maybe.
---
Good, I'm starting to see a trend. Lets all get on the same page on the finer points. 
---
**The Low Power Structure Manifesto:**
---
* When in low power there is NO tethering mechanic
---
* When in low power NO defensive modules work (pds, ecm, fighters, missiles, etc)
---
* Attacking a low power structure will result in: Either no timer at all, OR a single 24 hour timer based on the time of the attacker's initial bash. 
---
* If you do the 24hr thing, once bashed the first time, fueling said structure should not re-set the timers. But fueling it can bring back tether and defensive modules mentioned above. 
---
* You can still dock to get things out, or bring in hulls to try to defend... But no tether. 
---
* Damage caps should remain, I think removing them lowers the incentive to get a fight from the defenders. 
---
* Asset Safety should be disabled for any assets left in a low powered structure when that structure killed or when initially bashed during a low power state. Depending on weather or not you want the 24hr timer or none.
---
"I'm bored because I'm part of the biggest blue donut to ever donut"

VNI wasn't nerf'd, It was buffed. Been ignored for over a decade its now a little beast in small scale pvp. Right little shits now. 
---
Go Rat in a capital - 1 earn more, 2 whaling is fun.
---
Really? TRI was fighting Banderlogs in Pure Blind about a year ago and Goons showed up for most timers to kill TRI forces. Why is that? Because Ansiblex gates alowed them to travel 10j instead of 50. Goons and INIT used to crush that conflict with every timer created and it eventually made TRI move and Pure blind becomes a dead zone again. If you dont understand the effect of Ansiblex Gates over control of space then you need to go out more.
---
lol it's funny you say that. I've already downloaded the game, I had romanticized what you can do in this game like so many others

Accurate. And since SNUFF hadn't even claimed to be good pilots (I mean look at our Tournament history, c'mon), only good at droppingm ruse-cruises, ambushes, power-projection and to a dregree - fleet brawls, but not solo piloting... good point too.
---
Our player retention stats show otherwise, besides what's better, coming to us or going to Dead Corp #405721 with 3 players still logging in and telling everyone in Jita they're super active and looking for new blood?
---
Well, you loki losses are legendary too... =\]
---
Have you tried overheating the mwd?
---
Blackout is here to stay, and VNI isn't getting changed back. So HTFU or leave
---
High risk low reward mainly. A response fleet likely won't get there in time, and your ticks won't be worth the loss unless you rat or mine 10 hour shifts. People were on about the blackout making null sec high risk high reward, but where is the reward? 
---
Also spamming d-scan is an RSI- inducing mechanic. Not a high skill one. It makes practically every activity tedious, and exponentially less enjoyable. I can do it, but I'd rather not need a wrist brace in the near future. That's why I mainly run abyss or incursions to make cash now.
---
Maybe don't be in the biggest blob ever seen in New Eden which actively discourages roaming content in your space, if you don't want to be bored.
---
Very well executed ambushes, thank you very much =\]
---
Hmm i have the same thing with salvage and white loot. Already got 5 huge freight Containers full of that stuff.
---
Thats a good start but what it needs is a few more midslots.
---
If a legion entered a hazy atmosphere this is what itd look like. Well done! The style is gorgeous
---
It's obviously strongly inspired by the Eve one, but at least (unlike some of these games) they've replaced the assets so as not to be a blatant copyright infringement.
---
you mean wormhole right????
---
I would rather Dead Corp #405721 than be Line Member #42069 any day of the week.
---
What about a ewar script that force overheats a module on the target, could be really interesting to burn up your enemies guns. Perhaps it just inflicts heat damage or increases heat damage the target's modules take *if* they decide to heat anything while hit by the script.
---
Sigs and squads are awesome though. I'm still playing 3 years later, but that's just my anecdotal evidence aka not worth half a shit
---
I mean everyone got dread alt or two... like... there is no choice, really. Sometimes one person juggles a FAX, a loki, two dreads and a titan on standby (with the dreads able to reship to extra faxes)... how else would our like 30 actual players get 100+ fleets?
---
In order for Blackout to properly work we also need to nerf cynos
---
Honestly, the NPCs should be making us pay rent on all those station containers.

&gt;**CDIA Capsuleer Support Project**  
---
&gt;In a related development, the CDIA has confirmed that is preparing a series of technical readout datafiles for the use of newly-qualified capsuleers and expects to make a more detailed announcement shortly. The project is believed to be part of CONCORD's continuing effort to build up capsuleer force capabilities during the Triglavian invasion crisis and is reportedly benefitting from resources provided by the New Eden Defense Fund.
---
New ingame help information?
---
That's not what their other ad said
---
Oh hey I had the same idea!
---
In protest over no furry races
---
The new number is exactly as meaningful as that rad/s number because the one on weapon tracking was essentially a lie. It was the transversal of a potential target *with a notional sig radius* that wasn't the actual sig radius of whatever you were shooting anyway.
---
CONCORD isn't here to protect us. Concord is here to assure the empires that we will behave ourselves when we enter their space. If the drifters were threatening the control of the empires, concord would do something about it.
---
They're just upset because they had it said to them, and they chose to die rather than adapt. They didn't even consider adapting themselves. When the shoe's on the other foot, and we adapt rather than die, they are overwhelmed by their own helplessness. Of course, it's hard to put in work when you've been coasting off of a static set of accomplishments that were performed, for some, more than a decade ago.
---
Disband Goons.
---
Why? It's not like you matter in either scenario.
---
Isn't the point on the wrong side?
---
If he was looking for fights before, and looking for fights now, and he found fights more after, that would mean his *opponents* were more willing to engage.
---
So what do they say?
---
&gt; Delve, 9UY (Provi), GE-(Brave), R10 (Horde), TAPI (D-P)
---
&gt; Basically the only place to get fights.
---
no o3, no lxq, not a single detorid or border to it system actually. Honestly? look harder
---
&gt; Smaller alliances are dying/merging/literally not playing 
---
yes, that's been happening for at least a couple years now, probably more, nothing new. You should know this better than anyone else as a lowseccer honestly.
---
&gt; Bots are near enough gone
---
while i'd love for that to be the case, they aren't
---
&gt; Lowsec is heating up because yeah, intel is available.
---
well I live in lowsec too and for all i've seen, its not heating up because "intel is available", its heating up because a lot of lowseccers are coming back to the game for they see some hope in ccp actually fixing their game. Coupled with certain  groups moving and becoming active again in the area, said activity being completely unrelated to an aversion to a lack of local. 
---
&gt; I speak as a lowseccer with no skin in the game, but in null blackout is massively confining non-random ganking to tiny areas.
---
assuming this is not a troll it just feels in all of these threads that people don't really know how to instigate fights and think the blackout would magically solve that, and get extra annoyed when they don't find their afk vni as a consolation prize
---
You take this game way too seriously my dude :'D
---
Not an uncommon suggestion. A lot of people would bring it up when talking about changing/replacing ECM. 
---
I think it could be an fun addition.
---
They'd have been able to travel just as far with only a few more minutes of travel with the old fatigue jb's.
---
I mean, duh. It wouldn't be fun, otherwise.
---
Something that size in oils would probably cost more than a grand lol
---
I made ascii art of a Loki
---
&gt; ^^^^.
---
If you have fatigue then you can take a couple. And then sit for 20 min red timer. Not 6-7 one way and 6-7 way back.
---
The selected object window should definitely have more data in it.
---
Death to the overview!
---
Just because you can't leave Delve and go find some content doesn't mean the rest of us aren't able to step outside a comfort zone.
---
You can really get nasty and do a triple abyssal DC hull tanked brutix.
---
This painting made me inject into a Legion. Fantastic work!
---
I am disappoint.
---
&gt; A response fleet likely won't get there in time
---
If at all. I mostly see input broadcasting bombers wiping out even solo procurers.
---
just because I don't go hunting on my main doesn't mean I don't leave delve. My hunter alt has been in cache, detroid, immensea and malpais since the day blackout started.
---
This game is what you make of it. This is what you made of yours.
---
Not sure where you thought I was insinuating that, but you didn't answer my question
---
&gt; are just listing the capital systems for nullblocs
---
Yeah. He doesn't even have the slightest about where fights typically happen in Eso. Hint: The real ones aren't in D-P, that's just where badly-led gangs finally get run to ground after realizing they're not getting out of the region alive.
---
as it happens, not everyone in the game is some mystical old ncpl boogieman you people are obsessed with.
---
STONKS!
---
Been a while since I've laughed that hard
---
Pandas moving out because they're losing the war. Not because of blackout.
---
This must be incorrect. Blackout fixed everything.
---
LOL. No, you don't sit anywhere. You plan your bridge usage so that you take a max distance bridge then take gates to get to the next bridge while your timer wears down, the longest I ever had to wait when traveling with the old gates was about 2-3 minutes and that was on return trips after the fleet when everyone had built up blue timers causing longer red timers.
---
its still a personal issue of fear not a game mechanics issue.
---
It was really fine weed indeed!
---
You have been crying about the blackout for so long.
---
HTFU
---
... in before it's declared an exploit
---
Goons: We're here to ruin your game.
---
Also Goons: why doesn't anyone want to play with us?
---
Just accelerate what the game is already going to end up like and scrub the North/anyone not blue and place blues then CCP might do something about the piles of garbage untouched mechanics that built up over the years
---
That's not even salt it's the truth tbh
---
so why are the other 35 regions of the game that are dead empty then? When you have 41 possible regions for content and only 5 have something going on and 1 is playing host to a sov war but all 41 have people living in them you are doing something to discourage content, currently that would be blackout.
---
It comes in many forms, but yea this is one of them.
---
What /u/Alucard_1208 said is a legit work-around. Though it's important to make sure your sale is centered around the paperclip, including a description of it, production origin, things like that. And have a separate page for the "free item" that accompanies it. Don't ask how I know this.
---
It's too fucking late.  Everyone knows now.
---
Goons: reeeeeee
---
Also Goons: reeeeeee
---
Congratulations on a swift completion of step 4.
---
Im not crying about anything. Like I said in another comment, I make my ISK elsewhere now. I have however been adamant the blackout wasn't a great idea, and won't solve all the issues people pretended it would. It hurts the little guy more than the big one. Contrary to what CCP supposedly wanted.
---
Also if I my ask, why did the old bois lie to you about logging back in?
---
Leave goons if you are crying about finding content
---
Unless it's used to destroy a Dev then itl be hotfixed by tomorrow
---
fights were easy to find pre blackout now everyone pussies out to the point the only responses are capitals.
---
Text &amp; Descriptions:
---
Fixed various punctuation, spelling and grammar issues.
---
Maybe fix the missing comma before the word and?
---
no point arguing with these brainlets dude, they've never had to experience logistics on things bigger than their 5 friends before
---
It depends on the time of day, honestly. 
---

---
E-UNI are more of a US-TZ group now (PC9), Sons of Bane + affiliates are at the back of some dead-end pocket... mining, burners generally, but they do roam/give fights when they're in the mood. That's the general area close to Solitude, where Hobo's occasionally pop out from (toss-up between a random solo pilot and a capital drop).
---
There is (or were) a couple of groups in another of the Burner hubs in EF-F36, having a bit of a turf war recently (Early EU/RUS). Past them there's VEGA (EU again), they live down in the furthest pocket around RLL-9R. Problem is between the summer slump, harassment from Hobo's and the blackout, they've gone rather quiet as of late.
---
Only other group I can think of is Syndicated, a core group of about half a dozen or so living in the pipe to Cloud/Fountain. They will fight if you run into them when they're at home (they tend to go gate-camp during their up-time) but be prepared to be hard-countered to hell.
---
Critical thing is numbers. I imagine if you go around in a micro-gang then the people that are around will perk up, but anything over 10 and you can rule out 3/4's of those groups. I tag along with CAS on their roams, with the fleet size being close to 20-odd (on average) finding a fight in Syndi is close to impossible nowadays.
---
TL:DR Syndicate is not quite alive, not quite dead.
---
Why do people join them if people typically end up finding themselves unhappy ultimately? (Not familiar with politics so I apologize if there is a blatantly obvious response)
---
I literally had no idea.
---
Yes, those are the two options
---
&gt;The CDIA have also reiterated longstanding CONCORD advice that "exploration of Drifter Hive Systems should be avoided at all costs.
---
There is 60+ signatures in one of Hive systems atm and INIT Stuka fleet
---
non argument  
---
wouldn't solve a thing, doesn't have anything to do with me being in goons. how about get some people skills and learn to make friends and then also see that its still fucking empty
---
Blackout?  when/if it affects hunters and wormholes somehow
---
vni change back ?  Never
---
Both really.
---
I don't actually know what is meant by 'old bois'. I have found a lot of the people complaining are in goons or equivalent blue-donut group. Is that true for you as well?
---
If you hunt in those places
---
don’t cry to ccp when they use their supercapiral armadas to reward your arrival for hunting pve (which i assume is what you mean by “fights”)
---
Why do you think this is a "non argument"? If you leave goons, or whatever blue donut group you are in, you have more people to shoot at. 
---
Learn some people skills and find some other people to also shoot at the bigger groups.
---
I'd wager it'd be two grand, at least.
---
Super-cap umbrella*.
---
I mean, all those super-tits bouncing around whenever a stranger takes so much as a *breath* over there is enough to make anyone flustered.
---
Had the 25k twice all the rest have been 10k (been 10k for the last 7 days at least).
---
1 old PLEX = 500 nu PLEX. They got rid of Aurum so they had to make PLEX more granular to use for buying skins and such.
---
There is no "up" or "down" in space :P
---
Well I do the same. Like for every 300 Mil I spend on things that I want to fly, I also buy things with the same worth which I then store away forever. I just like the feeling of "If I loose this ship, I still got shit"
---
they already spent that money on ads for their new mobile game... you have a phone right?
---
Hey new player in Goons here
---
I joined goons in July and so far it's pretty good and I've been having the best time so fa in Eve. There are fleets all day, the FCs are very open to explain stuff and having good time
---
I dont get what people are saying that new players in Goons quit the game , you have so much stuff and activities you can do  in Delve that you shouldn't get bored
---
What kind of "proof" would satisfy you I wonder. You want me to hack CCP's database? If most upvoted review on Steam is not enough proof for you, then nothing is. You saying it is not like that is not enough proof either, so you kinda undermine yourself for asking proof buddy. I like how you keep coming back to this post even though you have made an idiot of yourself with every comment you wrote.
---
Yeah "bruh", you're whining like a little bitch. Content abounds. Stop being a pussy, get off your ass, and go get some.
---
We're actually really enjoying the black out right now, only heard 3-4 people complain in the last month about it with the rest of comms telling them they're wrong
---
Low power should have:
---
\- No timer.
---
\- No damage cap.
---
\- No tethering
---
\- No station services
---
\- No asset safety
---
Do this and replace timezone tanking with stront timers to make structure bashing great again.
---
I liked Test, but I though bluing everyone just to be huge was bad for eve.
---
if you are bored do new eden a solid, and leave the goons,
---
Nope. Red Alliance.
---
You have to login and undock to look for it
---
I just met one of those today IRL
---
&gt;J213058
---
ewww. that's a bad hole.
---
\&gt;joins biggest blob in game
---
\&gt;complains about boredom
---
spodbrain engaged
---
Since the blackout went into affect, I noticed the whole meta in null has become covops and T3Cs or anything that can move cloaked. I don’t mind bomber fleets but when it’s the only thing people will fly now it just get annoying and dull very quickly
---
I feel like increased overheat damage rather than inflicting damage on its own would be the way to go.
---
its actually sad how true this is
---
Dont forget to make the correct circle along with the pentagram. Or the summoning ritual wont work.
---
Maybe you guys should reset test or gotg then so you aren't functionally blue to 70% of null.
---
I’m glad you’re having fun!
---
I can shoot bigger groups as i always have been able to this changes literally nothing the only people i cant shoot are the people in my coalition, all in one region pretty much still doesnt open up vast swathes of content across the cluster, it just hammers home OPs point that theres very few places that are even alive.  
---
Ganks are not engaging content, 2 people shooting at 2 other people whilst theyre both hunting for vnis to gank does not count as epic fights or dope content, its a blip, there is no real content or fights going on now its either a gank or a feed to caps in the real world where the real pvp is.  
---
 I can whole heartedly hand on my heart tell you the blackout is shite because all this fabled content that apparently is showing up now with the nano gang fights and the ganks was there before the blackout in the same number all this has done is taken focus off of the interesting medium and big stuff making it more obvious that the small shits been going on.
