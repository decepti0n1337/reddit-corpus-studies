Yep the other commenter above added that you should bookmark every position you find. I couldn't find a video about it but it should work very well. I'm just wondering how likely you can catch the BS. You scan every 8s, 8s before the BS is cloaked it could be at most 10km away from the landing spot? They warp very slowly and stay long at the end of the warp. Then it takes a few seconds to warp there.. Or you could even warp to the same grid as it if you time it right
---
---
---
How so? The current tactics can be summed up as "Whose capital blob is bigger". This change makes it easier to limit reinforcements and cut off incoming capitals. Seems more tactical to me.
---
That’s pretty cool. Let’s just say for a second one of these groups wants to create sort of a trade hub where players seeking items could go. Would this be possible to manage? Are there systems that can prevent people from attempting attacks all of the time?
---
2b ship, prob. 2b fitting, minikowa on grid and T1 mining drones... funny was another word for sad
---
Then maybe ccp can grow a pair and just delete them and finally put a bullet into eve. It's clear they don't play their game because they have 0 clue all the consequences and are just shouting chaos into the void.
---
"We're going to fly 35,000 men 300 miles, and drop them behind enemy lines."
---

---
Yup, they used cynos.
---
Finally, a use for Long Range XL weapons!
---
You don't need a 100 man fleet to kill subcaps though. If you are hunting supers then God yes, you should need hundreds of dudes.
---
You can get plenty of content from small gang by *NOT* diving head first into the strongest and most well defended region in Null. Like, no one is forcing you to go to Delve, that's just your Grr Goons talking.

This has happened for most of the entire history of eve tp variying degrees of success. But with local being blacked out now intel channels have a MUCH harder time tracking enemy shops comming and and out of home territory.
---
Not impossible but takes ALOT more manpower
---
If this happens horde is gonna have such a hard time with all the awoxing that is gonna happen.
---
good lord i wish, in a perfect world they would do a capital stats squish or remove jump drives entirely
---
Unsubbed 3 of my 5 omega accounts, of those 3 (all 110m plus) I have skill extracted all of them and sold the skill injectors. Feel free to downvote.  Dead game lul.
---
You might have other factions just looking for  'good fights' and constantly camping the zone.
---
Are we going to use a mining support ship as a mining support ship?
---
Shocking
---
I don't know why CCP thought this would be a good idea. Ok, now I have a FAX with a couple recons in it pre fit with cynos and one sitting cloaked on grid. Awesome, well thought out plan....
---
I'd like to see all wormholes already scanned and available in probe window like an anomaly is for a few weeks see how that works out.
---
IT'S HARD TO STOP CLIMATE CHANGE. IT'S HARD TO STOP ALL CRIME. IT'S HARD TO OBTAIN JUSTICE. IT'S HARD TO CREATE RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT CAN SUSTAIN THE PLANET. some shit is hard, get over it. you clearly have no software dev experience. 
---
making incremental changes with minimal code changes (less bugs created) is ALWAYS better than completely re-coding all of your capital movement systems.
---
"This post was flagged by the community and is temporarily hidden."
---
Hmmm ...
---
Salvage was between 2-3M per frig, but expect that value to drop rapidly as more people start salvaging them.
---
It’s not a soft target if you actually defend it. Your home advantage is having a standing fleet, and a market hopefully good enough to give the ability to fit basically any hard counter to anything that comes into your space. The defensive perks should come from infrastructure and actual human interaction. Not just because the TCU has your corp’s name on it.
---
The Cyno Update post is trying to be sneaky and AFK Cloaky Camp, but we all know its still there.  
---
We're on to you, CCP!!!!1
---
Sounds like you need to do something else in-game, then.
---
A rather unfortunate dysfunction that OP suffers from.
---
My toon is less useless coming this september
---
So basically I’ll just have to get a few thousand guys and we should be able to lock it down
---
Punisher being slow is a common misconception. It's actually one of the fastest t1 frigates.
---
Ratting income will be down across the board and ratting *may be* fundamentally changed. But when you do go out, a carrier is a fine option.
---
There will always be a balance between hunters and ratters.  Ratting is by far the biggest isk faucet in the game.  If ratting slows enough there will be deflation and isk will be worth more.  If ratting slows enough, hunters will become rare.  Both those things lead to more ratters.
---
If anything I can see this reversing the trend of capital proliferation.  Get your 11b isk supers while you still can.
---
Am I understanding this right,  you are suggesting that people buy recon ships from the NPC stations with plex?
---
that video is very sad
---
This makes mass cyno vigils a lot more annoying.
---
I agree with you. 100% o7 &lt;3
---
Solid idea Doom!
---
I do. I also understand changes in just one direction will only make things worse. For the past several months it's been PVE nerfs and PVP buffs to crazy levels. Counter-play options keep getting harder or become nearly impossible. Just even the playing field some. Otherwise PVE guys won't even undock.
---
Since CCP has historically been good with iteration right?
---
1. You need 100 subcaps to kill 100 bombers? That's pretty sad man
---
2. Then don't get in range of the bombers, holy fuck it's not hard. Did you seriously think I was suggesting you "decloak" a zealot 30km off 100 bombers? Also never suggested putting a cloak on a zealot lmao.
---
Alternatively you can use a Muninn, or Loki, or literally just about anything because bombers are pretty much the most vulnerable ships in the game.
---
3. Have you considered that a group that goes to the trouble of catching a Rorq with 100 pilots in 5b of bombers has maybe earned the kill?
---
4. Get good
---
Tbh, I would also give hics the ability to light cynos too, but I definitely agree with the t3 covert subsystem letting you use cynos, both blops and normal
---
You might want to look into providence
---
The thread has be flagged, WHAT DOES IT SAY?
---
if you are unable to get a jf off the grid when it becomes instawarp while triple webbed i fear the problem is a bit deeper. The jf should be outside of the grid before the scan even finishes, let alone a ceptor lands
---
I never said we didn't escalate, we did many times when fights were closer to home, though a majority of our play was subcap roaming many midpoints away.  The main point was escalation to me was boring and I'm glad they're making it a bit more difficult.
---
Cause it's a garbage change not thought out at all.
---
No you don’t need that many. This is basically what NRDS is in Providence

We're not worried.  I don't think this is a healthy direction for the game however.
---
obligatory HTFU statement:
---
Skill injectors are optional~
---
I have been trying to FC since I started 2 years ago, this is the exact reason I don’t do it. The problem are not the cynos. Are that people don’t take fights they are guaranteed to win.
---
I wish there were more fleets around to bring a fleet and just fight
---
*worlds smallest violin*
---
He's retarded, ignore him.
---
Enjoy your rollercoaster
---
Back in the day Dreads were mostly Long range fit. Interestingly this change also reaffirms CCP Falcons commitment to bringing back long range battles. God speed Falcon.
---
There were epic wars before they turned capital.
---
Cyno vigils are going to be expensive.
---
Maybe light somewhere other than 0.
---
It may open up interesting avenues for different styles of play and counterplay
---
In many ways the punisher is super similar to the Navy slicer. Its speed and 2 mids makes kiting one of the better options for it. Punisher is super fast compaired to other non-minmatar combat frigates.
---
Why the wormholer flair?
---
Lol, if you think a guy that has a mino on grid can't afford a recon ship, your having a laugh.
---
 He is a dumb arse for use t1, unless he knows the bomber is there to hit is drones so has swapped them out to keep income churning.
---
!remindme 1 year

Yeah it looks like they have roots in role play though, not really my thing.

---
I doubt BDO would do that before the payout. If CCP fails PA saves tens of millions so Im fairly certain they wouldnt help CCP with income questions yet. And why CCP are doing drastic changes? They are out to whip everyone up in a frenzy so the numbers look good.
---
Naw that is old crap and only in cva look into Sev3rance
---
Almost everybody has gallente cruiser 5 trained because VNIs.
---
I'm not sure how that's a counter to what I'm saying (or if it was meant to be one).
---
I totally leave open the possibility that I'm wrong here, but the way I think this is going to play out is similar to how Horde set up their krabbing pocket in Fade. Most alliances will pick a few pockets that they can cut off with bubbles and then set up cloaky eyes to warn them when someone jumps in. The bubbles will delay the hunters long enough for the super/titan to get safe.
---
I'm not expecting that this is going to create roving gangs of people protecting supers, but even if it does that's not something I care about one way or another. I like whaling with a small tight-knit crew of people, it's what brings me happiness in this game, and I think the new cyno mechanics will accidentally gimp that playstyle. Overall I think they're moving in a positive direction, but the one tweak I'm advocating is to include a nullified hull. Interceptors are probably too disposable for what they want to do so I suggest T3Cs. If they opt to tie it in to the covert and/or the nullification subsystems all the better, that seems like a fair balance.
---
Same tbh
---
ill bring a box of some really good scotch to that party.
---
and three chars in bs.
---
I currently run 2x sebo + NSA, but never turn on the NSA unless I feel very safe (have the hammer behind me) or I would turn it on if I was trapped by sabre's and other methods (bad sabre pilots, smart bombs, fighter bombs) didn't work.
---
Haven't been caught yet though so its all still just theory for me.
---
Autopiloters
---
What are they doing that will cause massive alliances to collapse?
---
You only have 18b?
---
Are you sure you're a goon?
---
fucking hell.
---
seems like im runing out of excuses not to login anymore...
---
I also find the ability to probe while tethered ridiculous, that said you can launch probes then reenter a POS forecefield and continue scanning.
---
Where? I am not against this change other than there not being a lore reason. I have most definitely not cried about it. I do think it is silly that people like you are so bad at Eve that you have to push for these changes that serve no purpose just to try and get a kill.
---
&gt;Too drastic of a change.
---
because removing the ability to fit a cyno to all but 2 classes of ships isn't drastic at all...
---
Almost like people don't like this change.
---
Because I hate clicking on links:

As if Millions of Cynos Cried out in Terror
---
Published by Ashy on August 14, 2019
---
Now, I’m not exactly down with the kids, nor do I usually use much slang ironically, but it would appear that CCP Rise just “yeeted” cynos out the window. I even checked Urban Dictionary to be sure. As a dirty wormhole dweller with a null static, this is most definitely a good thing and you are never going to convince me otherwise. YEET.
---
￼
---
So what actually happened?…
---
In plain English, from September: cynos will only be able to be fitted onto Force Recon Ships, and Black Ops Battleships. This means that you will no longer be able to save your carrier by hitting the cyno unless you light it with one of the following ships:
---
Rapier – [195m ISK]
---
Arazu – [190m ISK]
---
Falcon – [185m ISK]
---
Pilgrim –[230m ISK]
---
Panther – [1.07b ISK]
---
Sin – [940m ISK]
---
Widow – [940m ISK]
---
Redeemer – [1.1b ISK]
---
You can reed the actual update thread right here. In order to reduce the impact on jump frieghters, they will now be able to jump to covert ops cynos such as those lit by a throwaway Prospect. Remember any ship with a Covert Ops Cloak can have a Covert Ops Cyno; you just need to have the cyno skill to five. Easy!
---
￼Thank you CCP Rise
---
In case it wasn’t clear, yes this means that you will no longer be able to spin up a fresh Noobship to cyno. Nor will you be able to sit a cyno hauler on the Keepstar. Whatever you cyno with has a minimum cost of almost 200m ISK and about 70 days of training time.
---
Given that, from experience, the standard nullsec response to a single roaming ship is measured in total supers, titans, and FAXes, I somehow don’t think that this cost is an issue. Maybe you shouldn’t be able to prevent gameplay with one button because you can’t be arsed to even try and fight back against a 5-man gang.
---
What, why would CCP dare take away my safety button?
---
Well, friend, because I know that most of the nullbears spewing salt (such as the one you can read to the left) don’t want to read then let’s go through the reasoning. For such a fundamental change to cyno behaviour there has to be a good reason for it, right?
---
￼lol, salt
---
They can be used on flocks of alts at nearly no risk or used by the largest and strongest ships in the game.
---
Yep that’s an obvious one. You can summon the might of a capital fleet with either a free ship, or the tankiest ships in New Eden. One of them doesn’t matter if it dies and the other probably will never die to a small gang under nine FAX reps.
---
With few options for cyno disruption, capital response time and power has grown to the point that it’s oppressing activity.
---
Absolutely. Like I said before, it has become far to prevalent that capital power can be projected around from a cyno without a second thought. Literally the evening before writing this my own 5-man Drekavac gang tackled a Thanatos on a Fortizar. Because we are so damn terrifying he had to drop a Ragnarok, Naglfar, Apostle, Minokawa, Rorqual, Nyx, and two more thannies. We retackled him and his buddies twice more only to take two more cyno drops including a Hel. Does that sound like it’s oppressing activity? It does to me.
---
This change will make it more complex and demanding to get capitals to the field quickly and give more strategic options for those wishing to disrupt capital response.
---
Obviously I agree with this and if you got this far you probably do too. Capital proliferation is a joke at this point. It’s like jump fatigue doesn’t even matter if there are seven dreads and reps ready to go 24/7. Changing which ships can use cynos technically won’t solve the issue, but it will mean that krabs need that extra step of having the cloaky Falcon ready to light. Not every carrier will do that, nor will every ratting Dominix. Even if they do, it adds a delay to the cyno and it gives me an extra 200m ISK kill to enjoy as a side dish.
---
Because there isn’t a huge amount more to be said without properly analysing the state of nullsec, feel free to browse this gallery of salt. If anything, I’d like to know why Kenny the Carebear here doesn’t approve. Why is it that so many people cry and shout “I’m unsubbing!” whenever there’s a change to make things more dangerous? Go play fucking Facebook games and Candy Crush, Kenny. Don’t you guys have phones?
---
sorry might be dumb question - but they only mention  Cynosural Field Generator I  
---
Does this mean  Cynosural Field Generator II can be used unrestricted? or will these restrictions also apply to II?
---
&gt; I want to see the mega alliances fall apart,
---
Perhpas you want to, as someone (probably) outside of a settled nullbloc that has spent years building up what they have now.
---
Why not reset the entire server while we're at it?
---
"We did a dumb thing" CCP
---
geez just imagine all the people in null you can hunt. until they unsubscribe anyways.  then itll all be susicide ganks in hisec. everyone join CODE - now recruiting
---
Hahaha. I know the feeling
---
O.o
---
There is no cyno II
---
because covert cynos.  
---
and since lokis and bombers were already good, they just got bumped to the top of what you want to fly if you want to kill shit by dropping on it.   any other subcaps are just inferior because they lack the mobility unless you are willing to double cyno or seed all systems with force recons
---
I am so ready for this change! And I’m a JF pilot. 
---
1) null and low sec will actually have to control the grid system prior to a fight. Both parties will have to preplan recons to fly behind enemy lines or their defending estates. 
---
2) FC’s won’t have to guess which ship out of the hundreds are going to light cynos. Oh you mean they didn’t bring any ships capable of lighting a cyno, great no capital escalation in a subcap fleet.  Or they brought a few, take them out or you’ll have a capital escalation.
---
3) standing fleets will or should have more impact, you’re going to see recon ships being a shepherd for a flock of rorquals. 
---
4) capital movement is going to be risky or a isk sink due to suicide cynos. Depending on how far you have to move. 
---
Here is to hoping number 1 brings a lot of content.
---
There is no Cynosural Field Generator II.
---
There is Cynosural Field Generator and Covert Cynosural Field Generator.
---
Nothing changes with Covert Cynosural Field Generator, except Jump Freighters can jump on it now.
---
I'm trolling you, that is correct. And it's working cause you're upset. I got pretty much exactly what I wanted and now I'm rubbing it in your face.
---
This is horse shit /u/CCP_Falcon, /u/CCP_Rise, /u/CCP_Fozzie
---
There was some intense spy hunting during the souring of relations with VOLT (they purged about as many non-spies as they purged spies), but their systems were still mostly accessible to neutrals and you could still for example VNI rat or do exploration.
---
The main shift was after they got purged from the region and came back, but they lost Yulai in the process which I felt really had the most provi-like culture of the alliances previously in the bloc.
---
In nullsec there are no rules, so there would be nothing preventing someone from shooting you if they feel like it.
---
However it's technically possible for it to happen, with players guarding the system as much as possible. Still wouldn't stop others from trying to frag the defenders and traders.
---
Jita is known as the system with the main trade hub at this point. Obviously highsec with the market being located in an NPC station. However nextdoor in the system of Perimeter there's a Keepstar, which is the biggest structure players can make. Originally placed by a group named TEST (shortened), but after some fighting the three major powers in nullsec banded together to defend it, so at this time it's virtually invulnerable. The three nullsec entities then share the market income that is generated by other players trading there. Taxes in this station is lower than the NPC station in Jita.
---
Ya ... now they just boson with titans camping gates.
---
But has he heard about the rorqu... Wait wrong doom
---
THIS
---
the price of force recons is gonna skyrocket, QUICK BUY BUY BUY
---
Ye, to use before biomassing:)
---
Can I has ur stuffs?
---
Just saw it- Looks good. No wonder why the krabs are, again, crying about unsubbing lmao
---
How the hell do you stay at 14-22km with manual piloting at mwd speeds (+opponent's speed)? Or 14-26km with overheated disruptor, but also often overheated mwd.
---
I find it impossible because I cannot see where and how fast my enemy is going. I can look up their velocity but it doesn't tell me in which direction. And I just got out of the range.
---
I know you can actually get closer than 14km if your opponent  doesn't have too strong webs and you're fast enough, but you're also probably not tracking anything during that time.
---
I'm currently practicing with atrons because they are pretty hard. They are fast and track really badly. I usually get caught because My enemy goes from 20 to 10 way too quickly.
---
I actually practice a lot but it's not very intuitive and if you don't keep the point, it's over, you practiced for 5s. I guess the most important information I can't read is enemy's momentum. I don't know where they are going relatively to me. When I'm orbiting I can usually focus the camera on their ship and see the movements and adjust my speed to them and it works nicely. But I'd also like to do it without orbit so that I can 1v2.
---
I mean, if it's possible, then I'll continue to practice harassing people in my atron (I don't kill a lot of things, but I poke everyone, the atron is good enough to warp in at almost 0 on people and still mwd out of scram range). Then maybe I'll undock with a faction disruptor and some real dps and it will be fun.
---
Fit some hyperspatials to it and it's more or less as fast as a ceptor. You won't really notice the difference!
---
How many Keepstars exist?
---
Snoo Snoo!!
---
“Bit of a tight margin” lmao 
---
How many times have you pulled this off?
---
This kills pretty much any capital movement in LS. Unless youre in snuff.
---
tbf, how many times did we hear delete local? A few months ago I'd have thought CCP obviously wasn't interested in that either.
---
and as the opportunities to work dry up they are forced to start doing movies and nude scenes they never wanted to do.
---
Daves been bitching for 4 weeks solid now, its like in Jerry Maguire when Tom Cruise is like I QUIT WHO'S COMIN WITH ME, only this time nobody stood up, not even little Renee.
---
Thoughts on cap fights / escalation. Keep boating in recons whenever you need a cyno? I feel like cynos makes sense on capitals, if not only supercarriers and titans, for that reason. I feel like there shouldn't be a reason to have to go with a recon to get more capital ships on grid when half your fleet already is sitting there. I'd think that at least some of those ships would be capable of doing so.
---
Not every interceptor is a Cyno though, sometimes they're purely scouts, or used for fast tackle, a force recon however is pretty garbage and obvious as to what it's there for
---
One person with high enough EVE O forum karma (whatever that is) can do it, later in the thread somebody demonstrates it on another post.
---
Id rather burn it.
---
Access control list.  It's mostly a computer term for a system of permissions.
---
It not only affects enemy accuracy, but your own as well. So if you're in a big tanky ship fighting frigates, it might be beneficial to stop dead if they're already on you, or fly directly away if they're still closing distance, to increase your guns' accuracy on the smaller targets. I've noticed the effects during particularly difficult security missions, but I have no experience fighting other Capsuleers, so I don't know whether the benefits would outweigh the negatives there.
---
Elo has the right mindset
---
Well all the nerfs have been evenly bad for small and large groups which makes them good for goons because as the biggest group they are best equipped to weather the change.
---
Only a severe and dramatic change to scarcity of resources could really hurt goons, and even then they couple probably just blob out the map to compensate.  They might even introduce crazy stuff like rationing belts and anoms to get by while the rest of the game just starved.  Or just become an incursion alliance or run L5s in an organized manner etc etc etc
---
So just to check, I'm assuming T3Cs will keep covert cynos and lose normal cynos?
---
I am not sure of the total number. I believe Goonswarm had 16 Keepstars at some point last year. They're the biggest and most wealthiest group in the game at this point. If I am not mistaken they have more than one in their main (staging) system, which isn't at all needed, it's more to brag at this point.
---
Remind me the last time Goons carried someone else's bags?  That argument (We're Goons.  We're here to help.) is 100% bullshit and it's even more ridiculous coming from you.  Just stop already.  It's embarrassing.
---

When are we bluing the triglavians?

so instead you want to replace it with:  first one to show up wins?

Ask him what he thinks about the cyno change.
---
Fairly accurate.
---
Yeah - definitely TDSIN now that I think of it.  MCAV's the guys who copied the Enyo meme from those BKFN nerds, right?
---
500 is definetly on the lower end for a bomber dps wise ill tell you that much, and in 100 bombers youll also find some polarized ones
---
Yeah, I wasn't sure whether it was a design choice or a limitation in the engine. Most of the game's systems seemed to be based on Neverwinter's mechanics, so that soured my experience somewhat.
---
Idk. Idk if I like it. Now I have to train a force recon to move my carrier. Super cost prohibitive. And carriers are in a bad place for pvp right now. Seems rushed and not at all well thought out.
---
Totally not a loaded, biased spergy comment from a goon known for biased, loaded spergy comments on the bottom of every thread.

Everyone will have a hard time with awoxing. If you can drop on anyone in your blops anonymously, and can only be revealed if you explode, a lot of little privateer groups are gonna pop up in the big blocs and make themselves horrible.

Goons: "No one will fight us- EVE IS DEAD"

  *meanwhile other regions are fighting small wars and taking space*
---
Increasing risk without increasing reward will only stop people doing it if risk and reward are in exact equilibrium, which is absolutely not the case.
---
In this case, icreased risk means increased risk, people will still do it because the reward is still worth. Maybe fewer people, but not a significant proportion.
---
Yes my son?

I think I'm with DoomBunny on this one, specifically "how are you suppose to get into system to shoot the super"
---
They built three games on that engine to varying and poor success before selling the company to PWI, who them whored it out with gambling and lootboxes.
---
Most of null ^except ^^delve
---
It would have to be logistically untenable for a group like goonswarm to maintain multi-region control, and they have some really amazing logistics.

Power projection is one (but not the only) thing that keeps the big blocs together, even if INIT for example wanted to break away from the Imperium it would currently be suicide. They MUST move from their current home, in the process losing a bunch of members, and there is no place they could move to where they can create a new long term home without getting beaten up by another bloc. And they look quite healthy as far as individual alliances go.
---
The value of alliances forming coalitions needs to be reduced, alliance directors need to feel confident that their alliance can survive in the mid/long term future without their allies before they will be willing to drop them.
---
No fucking wonder you're a cultist. Everybody already knows what UTC and timezones are. Fuck, even flat-earthers know that. The point is that nobody has to think about timezones or UTC unless they have to do things that require talking or coordinating with people in other timezones. Do you need smaller words, or did you finally figure it out this time?
---
I specifically said horde because they don’t have requirements to join. As for example in goons, you need to give ESI access and shot to get into pretty much any Corp. Not sure how it is for other big groups.
---
Year in TNT, over six in amokdotte. Yeah.
---
Sit with a bunch of friends in instaThrashers at the Nourvukaiken gate in Tama (just out of HS). Make lots of tacticals. Kill anything that jumps through. I know a guy, main's character name is Glen Burney, loves nothing more than just sitting there and doing that and showing people how to do it.
---
You need a little more than just Cruiser V. That aside, so they're going to use they're farming toons to skill in to a Recon to camp and light Cynos for someone else's farming toon? Even if they use a secondary account to run one on, that's one less toon they're multiboxing and farming ISK with. I'm struggling to see the downside
---
Uh.  This is a buff to my playstyle of multi accounting be anything else
---
But “why”? 
---
It’s because it’s a nonsensical nerf that doesn’t affect the target “veteran players” .  Not that i call myself that but... assuming people won’t have recon or blops alts or will be able to counter the much poorer hunters losing 1b cyno ships is ridiculously short sighted
---
Too much to be taken seriously considering g the THOUSANDS of other options spouted out everywhere
---
Downvote all you guys want, it doesn’t change that
---
Given that that has literally nothing to do with my post, sure.
---
I thought you guys were good at adapting?
---
YOLOing has never backfired.
---
I do this outside of jita dock. 
---
Payout is in tears
---
To be fair it’s already first to show up wins. Because when the first blob is on grid, the servers will crash trying to load the second blob.
---
Hilmar said in Sydney "we're gonna shake the game up and try new things without announcing fully" and /r/eve cheered with delight- Now that it affects *their* gameplay they're upset.
---
Then i bequeath unto you the opposite of what you don’t care about
---
No you’re wrong, a carrier can die to 20-30 bombers in like 30 secs. If you don’t play almost perfect, you will die before you can ever get help. You either rat in a cheap subcap and expect to die or rat in a super and up as it won’t die fast.
---
If you didn't have anything to say you didn't have to post instead of whatever this was supposed to be.
---
The rewards aren’t really worth it anymore when you can make more money in highsec incursions with no risk.
---
In terms of lines of code? It's not.
---
so whats going to be the new recon price... currently up to 500 million in jita... think it could hit even more?
---
I was wondering whether it was Cryptic or Perfect World who ballsed it up. I loved Neverwinter when it first came out. But I don't think I could ever get back into it again because every campaign is just a grind-a-thon with a P2W easy-mode key attached to it. I had a hell of a lot of fun with some of the player-made quests back in the day, but of course those got axed because of people making killrooms with no story or thought behind them to grind out gold or whatever.
---
Same in STO and Champions
---
duh?
---
C4 guy last i heard. 
---
Delete C4’s.
---
The effort isn’t worth the money when we can just do high sec incursions and make the same money with no risk. The changes are garbage and are going to ruin this game
---
It doesn’t even require half.
---
I made sure to mention in the original comment that if you are transpoder off any kills would be hidden in ESI as well.
---
Who's Matterrall?
---
Only issue I really see is the change making solo moving of capitals/supers not worth it.
---
Losing a single recon means moving that carrier/dread/fax was probably more expensive than insurance fraud and purchasing a new one.
---
Supers are already sold and re-purchased if players are moving across the map simply because people don't want to take the risk. The risk of moving would drastically increase as you can no longer do a suicide cyno and it can get expensive if you lose multiple recon's on a long route even if your super survives.
---
That shit is so fucking painful to train.
---
That's what you think, but you are mistaken.
---
But you all bitch when we use our infrastructure and interactions to set up boson camps and have a super umbrella. Go fuck yourself all you want is to kill supers with no risk to yourself
---
Just because they put a lot of effort into bending the knee doesn’t mean they have rights. 
---
Sometimes the world just needs to burn.
---
I just wish they'd go apeshit all at once.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Blackout was a cool shakeup, but it had a lot of pros AND cons. Cyno changes seem rather drastic, but something has been needed for YEARS at this point. Etc.
---
I wish they'd brainstorm the fuck out of "chaos"-y changes and throw a dozen of them into New Eden simultaneously. Throw a monkey wrench into every area of space all at the same time (and remove tethering and reinforce timers from unfueled citadels, while you're at it) and we'll really have chaos.
---
I fourth this concusion.
---
Karmafleet, Brave and Pandemic Horde are some of the nullsec corporations that welcome new players. All part of different alliances.
---
It is known.
---
goonswarm test or Pandemic Horde are good choices for this.
---
In personal bias i will say goons but i have limited experience elsewhere.
---
PH AND TEST RECRUITERS I SUMMON THEE, make your cases NOW
---
lol cyno in a safe system next door and use the gates lmao!!!!
---
Maybe add in Command Ships, since they are rarely used and their boost role has been taken over by other ships, instead of blops.
---
Eve
---
So... keep reading this sub?
---
When the fuck did I say ANYTHING about boson camps OR shooting supers?
---
Can some explain what the controversy with this cyno change is about. This is an area of the game I have zero experience with.
---
I'll take "Ways to get banned for RMT for 1000, Alex."
---
A max range jump with a cap requires 40min+ if you don't want fatigue to grow...
---
Keep up the good fight my dude
---
No meaningless bloc or bloc-pet life? You literally joined Roving Guns and then tried to get fleets to go on structure bashes in NPC venal to do your bidding for a month, before rage quitting and going back to your “independent empire.” You have literally alienated every single person that’s interacted with you in the game over the past 4 years. You’re on your own because of your own megalomaniac ego, not because you don’t like being in a bloc or being a bloc-pet. The only people that you can get to join are new bros who haven’t figured out how much better anywhere but with you can be. But give them a couple months and we’ll see how many remain in that toxic quagmire created by no one other than yourself.
---
EVE, while I laugh at people like you that completely missed the nature of this game due to some really bad decisions CCP made the last couple of years.
---
If you're not a dumb ass in a cheap AF alliance, you can usually get a subsidized Mino for not much more than a recon hull.
---
Also, your Mino isn't going to die every time you light a cyno, and if it does, it's insured.
---
is it the one with the hat?
---
Most guys ditch bad relationships before then. You must be dedicated or desperate
---
Likely more that the only thing that can be easily jump-bridged with this change is a throwaway 50m ISK frigate rocking Battleship weapons that strikes from literal *invisibility* and has no appreciable counterplay to its own movements.
---
I just find it amusing that caps/supers that are "invincible unless they fuck up" because of the effort put into protecting them by other players are a problem, yet bombers are A-OK.
---
In all honesty , I also do it because i own over 200 of them lol
---
Magic 8ball says no
---
Yeap. /u/ccp_falcon posted on twitter that he had to open a second thread to keep the 'feedback' going.
---
nb4 c4s all get permanent static’s to null and can cyno out to those static’s but can’t be cynod back into
---
For uh.... chaos...
---
Do iiiit
---
Before now they could still cyno and travel, but I could also use them to multibox on bomber fleets.
---
Rorqs honestly will likely be the least affected by this change assuming there's a defense fleet. Everything else I imagine will either die to roamers or dreadbombs.
---
Yeah
---
&gt; If ratting slows enough there will be deflation and isk will be worth more.
---
Just so you know: isk in the past few years already increased its buying power in many areas except plex because mineral production outpaced it, which is reflected by the fact that T1 ships, including capitals and supercapitals, all brcame cheaper
---
&gt; Perhpas you want to, as someone (probably) outside of a settled nullbloc that has spent years building up what they have now. 
---
It's one thing to not want to see all your time and efforts in game go up in smoke... but at the same time, that all of your time and efforts in game can go up in smoke is Eve's biggest claim to fame.
---
CEO of Corp with 14 real people here. We love blackout.
---
That will be an expensive cyno.
---
This is an amazing question
---
HICs should definitly have cyno.
---
Is this a meme I'm not getting?
---
Point was more an. Oh you can use this module, assuming it will need a special skill, you either get registered with a special sig or you not accepted. And well I don’t really see the use of something like that. You still need to be organized with another entity to do something meaningful. Unless your idea is to do it so you can awox to get kills just to get kills. Which people don’t care. They want their killboards green so they can brag about their leeet pvp abilities.
---
Yeah the risk reward thing often doesnt fly in EVE. Players are quite binary about it. At a certain level of risk or rather, lack of control, they will generally stop doing things entirely
---
My bros in Am0k are the reason I've played this long. Cute attempt though.
---
It's supposed to be calderi flair but it won't update.
---
" Let the toxic assholes and crybabies leave. We'll be better off without them in the long run. "  
---
the game's population is about 50% toxic, 50% crybaby good luck playing an online game as the only person on the server.
---
I think we're at 47 keepstars or something like that now
---
I'm ok with blops and recons, but if we could get cynos on Fax machines too, so we can still hard cyno into cap/supercap fights, that would be swell.
---
A cyno fax has really low krab potential. It doesn't rat, it doesn't mine. You could even take away the ability to fit entosis, and I think that would be fine.
---
This is truly a great service to the community, much appreciated.
---
Using capitals in provi doesn't even need cynos since you can just gate around the region.
---
I guess to me the biggest impact is that it requires significantly more training to be able to light a cyno, so this support role becomes unavailable for new pilots
---
Different types of people have different types of tolerance to it, I personally like doing my homework and studying while mining. The way I see it you don't mine to mine you mine so you can be doing something productive in game while you're doing something else you'd normally do.
---
I don't have a specific interest in fucking over null blocs, but some mechanics that shake up the status quo in a big way sound good to me (as a subbed-but-not-playing bittervet sort).
---
Providence, literally every day.
---
T3C aren't a big commitment. And I think the point is to not be able to tank a moderately sized fleet in your cyno ship. T3s can definitely tank. Blops can a bit more than recons, but they have that BS sig to deal with
---
Kinda bullshit this one. Light covered cyno midspace, jump in, warp to instadock bookmark
---
Id be shocked if krab numbers went up during blackout.
---
It's been fixed.
---
That video was pure gold. Goddamnit CCP
---
A bomber or covops that almost never dies is going to kill the wallets of JF pilots? TIL
---
If it's free, I'll take it.
---
Before the battle of 2013 the eve wars weren't anything special. Capitals started seeing mass deployment around that time and suddenly we had 4000 player battles starting over a miss click. Never forget that the blood bath was started because of a titan. Without capitals large scale fight that break the universe and get talked about irl arent going to happen.
---
Why do I even still play this game?
---
I realised it was broke when an orthrus lit a cyno.
---
exactly
---
Agreed, we don't even have capitals and half the alliance is thinking of ways to abuse this (not like we came up with any good idea, but it's the intention that counts).
---
The sentiment is (obviously) already strong in goonswarm, granted those that were smart already have multiple sources of income so it shouldn't be too bad for the "better" players.
---
With this change carrier rating is effectively dead, Super rating is going to happen less often and when you do you're going to see Aeons and Wyverns running boosts as well as full tank to keep them selves up until a harpy fleet shows up to save them from bombers bar. On the other hand I know how it feels to get cyno'd on while going after a potential kill, only to be told to warp off but 99% of the time we still get 3-4 apostle kills in the process. This change has good intentions but is going to do nothing but have people leave those alliances and go to Highsec, reducing the amount of targets players can hunt making null even less populated than it is. 
---
I hope this change doesnt go through but the isk faucet of rating does need to be looked at.
---
Other than them being T1 rather than T2 mining drones I see nothing wrong, using Excavators in blackout is super dumb
---
That is not actually true, and you proved why yourself just a moment ago. Lots of folks join horde to awox them, and yet many blue kills in horde are done under alts made for just that purpose which add nothing to the main character's killboards.
---
Sometimes, people just wanna screw someone else over, and a transponder off option would allow that to happen in a way that weakens coalition and blue standing bonds, which is the strongest "big group" power out there.
---
No RR will kill that fast
---
Damnit I lost it in a worm hole. If can find it then yours!
---
If you were in the Goon Caracal fleet, we did apologise for the Cerbs. We had another fleet out roaming and formed 13 dudes to fight your ~26, it was Cerbs or nothing.
---
The 2 days after that, you brought Caracals to Provi and we brought Caracals too.
---
Fucking nobody has ever progressed into a hulk and then into a rorq. Mining "progression" has basically been nonexistent since rorqs became a mining ship instead of a support ship. Maybe some diehard people who legitimately enjoy mining in and of itself spent some time in barges or a skiff or orca with t2 drones before they could fly and afford a rorq with exacators... but basically it's been "I should salvage or VNI rat or otherwise make more isk than I can through the mining route until I can do a rorq."
---
And? My point stands. I'm not putting up with being yelled at while playing a GAME.
---
I suspect before the next patch in sept. So a week or so
---
You did blue them, they just didn't blue you back.
---
Tyty.
---
Good idea!
---
When Spectrefleet declared a campaign to remove Provibloc from their space, actively engages Provibloc on important timers, it's not hard to see why Provi forms against them like a real fleet.
---
Uhhhhh it's like the same thing but better!
---
-im a recruiter I swear
---
How to cripple the economy - the TLDR version.  
---
CCP's failure to understand their own economy is comical.
---
Bunch of Nullsec Carebears who used to talk about how the game was unfair, and was hard, and to get used to it,  complaining that the game is unfair,  is hard,  and to get used to it.
---
Harden up princess; no more supercap blobbing your way out of bad planning and crap strategy.
---
Lol i am getting the sense you dont fly rorqs or bombers and are talking out of your ass. First off a sb has way better than 30km range try 60km + if you unlcoak or warp in a subcap on grid with 100+ bombers it will last until its adc goes off . And no you dont need 100 guys to counter a 100 man sb gang. But if you come in with 20 you are going to get murdered without doing jack shit.
---
I mean.. It’s an impressive killboard !
---
lol until your prices go up 200%, then we'll be laughing.
---
Yeah but this requires nullblob to be willing to undock in something smaller than a Rorqual.
---
I’ll play more eve
---
Such a big boy to use words like assholes and crybabies.  Don't you look so grown up.
---
He has a code tag leave him alone he's special
---
Many people cheered. I was not one. I thought the blackout had a good core idea behind it. Instant Intel is bad. But this doesn't have the same sense behind it to me. Maybe I am missing something. But this seems to just be winging random shit at the wall and seeing what happens.
---
wtb shield slaves
---
My pleasure! Rat my friend, rat.
---
Because your jump capable pilot doesn't need cyno 5? They are the ones jumping...
---
rorq with t2 drones still outmines a hulk easily. The joke was how there is now a fax just sitting int eh belt with them. And its like this everywhere, every where I could find barges in space there was either a fax on field or one tethered on a local citadel ready to war in.
---
was thinking more for non-covert cynos, but now that you've made me think harder - if they've already skilled into a jf and invested that level of isk cyno V would be a must.
---
Oooh I’m so scared of the goons and their plans, they’re always 20 steps ahead of everyone else
---
Why were none of you crying when moon mining went from logging in a hauler once a week to active mining? That's clearly putting more time/energy/investment into doing something without a greater reward.
---
You're against the changes because they're reducing your alliance's ability to stay ahead of everyone forever just by being a large blob.
---
I eat in T3’s. Come at me.
---
CCPlz instead of blops or force recons (already quite popular ships) lighting cynos how about you show some love for your red headed step children. 
---
Make these ships the only ones that can light a cyno:
---
Corax, Eris, Griffin navy issue, Crow, Taranis, Claw, Crusader, Kitsune, Primae, Caracal navy issue, Falcon, Rook, Blackbird, Kitsune, Widow, Dominix Navy Issue.
---
the only difference the september patch will make is they will add a cyno recon to the belt that the fax will have pre-locked
---
That's the thing, I'm not upset. That's why you are so bad at trolling. An upset person spewing salt would have resorted to attacking you by now. See the replies to most of my shitposts for an example of what salt actually is.
---
I legit don't care about the change, so nothing whatsoever to be salty about lol.
---
cynos are basically the way to move huge fleet across large expanses for war or to kill things.  they just got taken out back and shot.   There are several ramifications, home defense got a bit tougher, bombers got buffed to the point where they are basically the meta, logistics got a bit tougher, and wars are going to suck balls even more (although on the plus side, less tidi because fewer big fights).
---
just stop feeding them so i can haul more useless stuff
---
No
---
This works well for miners. Not so well for domis and carrier pilots.
---
I love you.
---
[removed]
---
Honestly I'm just surprised how much you pvp guys don't want anything related to your playstyle changed. Just gimmie a roughly 50/50 split, not changes 100% in favor of pvp play. 
---
Or keep drinking that subreddit koolaid.
---
As in you can train some of the prerequisite skills for cynos while you're still alpha (thus costing nothing except time)
---
Someone mentioned home?  :v
---
LIES !
---
Does he even know how a probe launcher works? He's probably a wormholer only because he can't get out.
---
Pushes people to supercaps, since carriers die too fast to be saved at times, while Supers don't.
---
A Nid has like 2.5 million EHP in the best of cases with a non-bling fit. A Hel can hit close to 30 pretty easily.
---
Swoosh
---
I always launch probes on undock, then warp to a bookmark 300k off the station to cloak up as fast as possible. I could totally warp, drop probes, then cloak.
---
What is the logic behind the fact that you can launch probes then cloak with them less than 2km from you?
---
&gt;cAuSe It'S a GaRbAgE cHaNgE nOt ThOuGhT oUt At AlL.
---
One of the largest trade hubs in the entire game is in 1DQ, staging system for The Imperium.
---
The system to prevent attacks is have the biggest dick and be willing to throw it on the table.
---
By home defense being tougher, does that mean groups will have to keep a stable of ships and clones in that system instead of relying on cyno to move their fleet in as needed from a distance away?
---
As a PushX JF pilot I can say Stain is a nightmare on a good day.
---
With this change its... well... yikes.
---
Let the salt flow
---
The Army of Mango Alliance is abbreviated as TAMA. But their ticker is AOM.
---
Weird flex but ok?
---
Hmm if only there were ships capable of projecting damage outside of 60km...
---
There aren't though, so I guess you're right. There is truly no way to protect your precious rorqual from the bomber menace.
---
Goddamn spodbrains
---
yeah dude i know tons of newbros who absolutely love warping on grid, pushing f1 and sitting there for 10 minutes. they're all gonna be super bummed at losing access to this dynamic and engaging support role
---
fucking ccp no wonder everyone is unsubbing
---
&gt;Because it logically must be included when talking about the harm that cloaked ships can do and why they need a nerf.
---
wrong
---
I miss my super tanky 100 ab tengu
---
I'd argue this isn't carebear shit. Station trading and building ships used for ganking has nothing to do with being a carebear. Carebearism is a state of mind.
---
I thought it had something to do with the battle of Marengo but if guess that was to much to hope for
---
It’s not prohibitive to ratting, I rat solo with our local like 3 days a week.
---
Perhaps this will fall out of the meta.
---
not really.  most likely they will keep cyno ships in each system and still cyno in. which is a bit more of a pain in the ass instead of just pushing a button.  also i guess it will be nice that the attackers won't really be able to escalate as easily.   
---
however, i'm sure there will be several idiots who will mine / rat solo and not be saved. 
---
most likely, it will lead to more clumping up, ala the delve model.
---
Lmao it's bad for you blobbing people with 15 carriers 
---
Adapt retard
---
Found the person with balls
---
I don't think CCP actually knows what needs to be fixed
---
A cyno turns liquid ozone into angry nerds in supers. Previously any ship could fit one and so they were quite safe. This change means that the only way to light a cyno is to have an expensive, easy to kill ship on standby. Other post has impacts right.
---
remember when Dreadnoughts were siege ships. with siege modules.
---
not suicide dread bombs only, cause sieging on a citadel is barely worth it.  
---
...i miss POS....
---
meh...... 2008-2010 I think if i'm gonna day dream about gaming it'd be how lucrative online poker was back then 😁. But nah, nostalgia is worse than heroin my friend.Live in the moment and forget about the past. Stop thinking about how fun eve was and start thinking about how i can have fun playing eve. 
---
Or you could just go afg like me.......
---
There is far too little risk for the reward, it's about time risk was injected back into this game again.
---
I don't think people are reading into this deep enough. The null blocks will be fine, as will their supers and rorquals. 
---
I see this effecting subcaps (yes really), and dread bombs. I'm sure people who have more than a few months in this game and brain cells will find more.
---
LOL, just cyno off grid and warp in.  There is a reason warp and grids exist.
---
This is a good change.
---
Just throwing it out there, there are plenty of people who will give you legit loans on the forum in one of the subsections of the marketplace, services I believe.
---
Bear in mind you'll likely have to put up collateral if you're asking for any appreciable sum.
---
bombers, that's about it now
---
Throw that many monkey wrenches into the game at once and everything will simply grind to a halt while the blocs meta each one, one by one, and then return in a week back to the status quo. Throwing bullshit for the sake of throwing bullshit is the exact opposite of a thought out balance change.
---
Eh, some people will always come out, and some will get ballsy again after some time of not undocking their toys.
---
I was saying in effect that if people put in the work to be safe then it's reasonable that they would be pretty safe. Steering things toward pilots actively defending their space would be the ideal direction. I agree that the list of cyno ships should be longer and for nullification I'd only advocate for T3's maybe, but the counterplay options for cynos in absence of nullification are enticing at all scales. 
---
I just think that so much of the mindset nowadays is geared around rorqs and supers to the point that nobody is willing to entertain the thought that it could be different if we walked ourselves off this way of thinking and hard turned things back toward the relevance of subcaps. Like the game would be so much more fun if everyone didn't constantly have their highest value asset in play and build their mentality off of that. I don't think it's a radical sentiment to say that caps and supers are destroying this game and we need changes to curb that even if like this one they are unpalatable.
---
Gotta say probably Signal Cartel, they're all lovely people.
---
&gt; Missing a few things. SRP doesnt exist in the vast majority of cases, not for a ratter getting caught. Hell I've been on plenty of deployments where SRP didnt exist even for doctrine ships. So, case stands.
---
We SRP certain ratting subcaps.  They have to be fit to spec, within reason (if a newb has to downgrade something, that's fine).  What other people do is up to them, but that's what we do.
---
 
---
&gt;Where the fuck do you get a free procurer?
---
The newbro gets the free, fit procurer from the corp.  We just stock 'em in our athanors for our dudes. If they get lost, we just replace them.  
---
A t1 strip procurer with porpoise boosts pulls around 200m an hour on R64s. This is about 4x what they can reasonably expect to get subcap ratting, and is no more boring than watching yourself orbit an LCO with your 100MN on while ratting.
---
Bob has to have aligned the holes and anoms right so I’m out of dscan, and I have to have an idea of the system being empty, then just dscan for probes as I shoot sleepers.
---
If I do see probes, then I jump in a Strat or Hecate and have fun chasing them out, if it’s something I can’t handle, then I can just passively-aggressively lob bombs at them till they get bored.
---

I said "but" then linked you

No it's not ;)  You're the one whose wrong here.

Why do you hate clicking links? It's one button. That you already clicked. You can even go directly there instead of comments.

I love you dude, keep on keeping on
---
"Docking request denied"
---
Believe it or not, current usage of cynos isn't limited to warping on grid. Also most of the alliances I've been to had people that would be willing to help a bro out and light a cyno when one is needed. A lot of those people were newbros too, who wouldn't have recon or a blops as their top training priority.
---
Which get cleaned up by a rage ping of assault frigates long before a well tanked cap dies.
---
Oh I do, and then the economy will balance out again as people find new methods to rat. People have become far, far too complacent in null. 
---
Let the galaxy burn.
---
Agreed, but the miners on reddit don't understand so I have to make it simple for them.  Spodbrain, you see.
---
If the connection to low sec ever happens it would only be fitting to connect with low sec Solitude.  Basically getting you no where and have no impact in either region.
---
we kill you too many times?
---
We can call the doctrine "Slowcrabs" instead of "Slowcats"!!

you have literally no idea what you are talking about. Let me break it down for you. SB are frigates. Frigates are fast and align quickly. they can dictate range against serious threats. being small and fast they are very hard to hit. meanwhile they each have 4k alpha. your average buffer cruiser has 20-40k ehp. if you try to engage 100 SB with 20 hacs you are gonna feed a bunch more in hacs than they feed in SB. In short you are a fucking moron and should learn more about the game instead of talking out your ass.
---
You can lower your speed to x% by clicking your ship's speed bar.
---
The purpose of MWD is to give you range control even if your hull is slower/can't fit web while having the flexibility to kite against other MWD fits. There's no point flying at max speed or overheat against an AB frigate that moves 1.4k/1.8k.
---
You have to know your own speed bar click locations and your opponent's speeds (eg. AB atron is like 1.8 heated). Ideally you'd go like 1.6-1.8 and raise to 2k+ against heat. You can shave off speed with manual flying as well, this is why you want to always be faster rather than flying with identical speeds.
---
One of the lines pointing from your ship is your opponent's facing. Other factor is simple intuition due to changing distance and situation in the fight. Manual orbit is very static in terms of changing distance since you repeat roughly the same clicks in the same intervals. It's very easy to spot when your opponent breaks orbit even if you miss the facing line.
---
Make sure your ship brackets are always on for all ships on grid (instead of just the selected object), mandatory vs drone boats and 1vsX.

You should also modify the overview html code to enhance the in-space distance to enemy ship.

I am sure that CCP will not see that my $15 per month is better than the $150+ I once paid them. 1 account only will never fly. Even if they did I can just use another PC + another bank account. It isn't a fight CCP would win.
---
I agree, but only faction Titans should be able to cyno.
---
I endorse this product and or service
---
Well, now that's a clever way to get people to pay for more accounts.
---
It's still super umbrella with more steps, but I give it a gentleman's C for effort.
---
If they really wanted to make some waves, they would only allow capital ships, including freighters, and citadels to fit the non-covert cyno, and *not* allow non-covert ships to teleport to covert cynos.
---
Only capital ships and assets should benefit from the umbrella, and the umbrella should only be as wide as the capital and infrastructural deployment.  It's not rocket engineering.
---
They can become *invisible*. That's why.
---
wts arazus/rapiers, 550M
---
The downside is that unless you can afford that with in-game grinding, you're just going to have to lose your ratting ships. Some people are going to be OK with that. I'll bet a lot of people are going to run the maths and decide not to bother krabbing and go play another game.
---
You inspired me to undock an Atron today, and I wanted to hammer your final statement home with this killmail:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78424650/
---
I doubt he will leave home with only Void again.
---
Depends mass limits because if not theres a goon super fleet coming to a wh near you
---
with most decent sized bomber fleets, unless you are a rorq or a supercarrier it will die before the assault frigs show up, and in some places only rorqs and fully tanked out supers will die
---
&gt; They get tackled they decloak and cyno.
---
oh a blops kill neat
---
Fucking provi and immensia lmao
---
Super and rorqs now require a recon scout alt.  You should have been scouting for super ratting anyways...now its just a recon alt.
---
HERE WE GO BOIS
---
I actually don’t get why you did, but i appreciate the mention
---
Unlike yout kneejerk reaction, amirite?
---
It feels like less people in systems.  Also shows less logged in.  Not sure how 25% kill drop amd 60% pve drop is good for the game
---
Eliminate all gates to stain so it can only be accessed by capital ships and wormholes.
---
&gt;they are meant to be hit hard and run, not stick around and fight.
---
Except they don't hit particularly hard either.....
---
Battleship in general are an embarrassment as far as DPS and tank goes, there's been too much power creep of the smaller ship classes, which has been fine in relation to each other and caps, but overall terrible fit battleships of all tiers.
---
i find these kind of comments ill conceived. losing players is not a good thing for the health of the game regardless of if you disagree with their play style or not.
---
that's not shooting, thats a scanner. Circadians do it in hisec too
---
yea can confirm unless you are going really far most of the time your fatigue will be long gone before your cyno goes down
---
Then go all out, because right now chaos is code for change nullsec. There are 3 other areas of the game they could put wild changes in to see what happens but seem to be only focused on nullsec.
---
two common places people go because it used to be populated and have lots of targets, now they are mostly ghost towns.
---
Sneeki breeki
---
!remindme 6 months
---
Its better for the game because the circle jerk squad backing hilmar's flavor of the month stupidity said so.
---
I want to see a reduction in the size of eve. Force all of us in close proximity.
---
Why don't the trigs take on concord then or something like that. Cause highsec to become lowsec.
---
Same here dude. Good stuff. They should have done this years ago. Better late than never though.
---
You uh.... know jfs were a thing before citadels right?
---
As in they were balanced before outposts were at every midpoint... you know that... right?
---
Because residents are generally retarded and loosely organized and easy to bait* ftfy
---
Delete interceptor nullification then
---
can't be retarded and loosely organized if you're logged off.
---
What a clever post!
---
Please allow procurers to be used w/ cynos in low sec.
---
No it’s better because uh bots die and moar kills and i re subscribed my 3 gank alts for 1 month because fuck nullbears grrr i’m dangerous look how good i am fuck you unsubscribe huehuehue
---
Primae doesn't have highslots :thonk:
---
Gosh, it sounds like.... 
---
Oh my, sounds like people playing the game.
---
Let's be honest: if you can get solo kills with a rookie ship you get to brag about it.
---
...and removes meme gameplay styles like Procurer cynos.
---
I almost missed the sarcasm
---
Because clicking that link takes me from the relative safety to what is possibly some cesspool  like Eve-o, INN, YouTube, etc.
---
&gt;SBs are frigates. Frigates are fast
---
They're fucking SBs you complete idiot. Even a hound, the fastest SB, is clocking a whopping ~2200m/s with an MWD. A Muninn can not only outrun one, but in all likelihood volley it off the grid too. "Dictate range"... what a fucking joke lmao
---
You're the classic unimaginative carebear that thinks he knows how PvP works because he's hit F1 a few times but actually knows nothing and doesn't have the brains to adapt to changing threats in the game.
---
You're a fucking dork
---
Uh.... You think far less people actually doing stuff to play the game is what we need?
---
Shou can get a similar effect by ddosing the fuck out of tranquility if you think that’s “the solution” 
---
Personally i think actually playing the game and people playing with me was fun.  But to each their own
---
Ain't wrong
---
I dont think he will need to, I can hear the REEEEEEs from here.
---
And Rorqs.    
---
And caps being able to call in more caps.
---
Go to delve or other hotbeds and randomly spam fleet invites.  When they accept fleet war them to sun
---
Instant and fun group activity
---
I.... can’t say i wouldn’t have judged you
---
areas settled with small alliances without supercap umbrella
---
&gt; has no appreciable counterplay
---
Git good at destroyers, goon
---
when will the Triglavian Invasion end??  some scout ships destroyed my ship when I wasn't in an invaded system.  No notice of system being invaded.  the ships warped in without warning and destroyed my ship and cargo in 2 seconds.  :(  I might have to take a long break until Invading Precursor Entities are gone forever.
---
I completely agree. Marauders should be mini-dreads. I don't think dreads should have HAW weapons at all, it's not what they were ever designed for... but then again, that's not really what marauders were designed for either.
---
But there's no reason a marauder should cost more to fit, and take longer to properly train into, than a fucking HAW dread that does everything better.
---
If someone is hunting, I'm sure they'll bring a bomber or force recon along to make sure they can escalate. 
---
Covert cyno on the bomber -&gt; in comes recon -&gt; cyno on the recon -&gt; in comes the fleet.
---
I would have judged me too
---
The same thing we do every night, Pinky. Try and take over the world.
---
Most of Immensea would have a super umbrella except they are retarded and don't know how to communicate.
---
Fun secondary activity: selling shiny miner loot one item at a time and tracking down the buyers and ganking them.
---
I once had an ORE Strip Miner that I resold four times before the loot fairy ate it.
---
Have you ever played classic wow? I mean do you remember stunlock?
---
After #gonggate [when they added a *dong* sound after each kill, including NPCs](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JblPucmHY0E) i'm convinced no one at CCP plays the game maybe outside of tests on SiSi.  
---
*Or*, the people that do play have 0 decision making or persuasive power.
---
possibly, maybe not. It doesn't take long to get bridged to a cyno beacon then warp over. Under a minute? Two if slow?
---
All citadel loot/asset safety works like wormholes? Pretty sure that'd cause a lot of undocking AND chaos.
---
Can I have your assets?
---
Credits to Neuro from TIs discord for making it
---
SrGrafo for template
---
o u mad
---
i think the real issue isnt nerfing mining or super cap ratting. its nerfing them so heavily after they've been in the game so long. The economies fucked and if they reduce the new supply of isk/minerals its going to fuck it up even worse.
---
Kill ppl in lowsec, give them 10mil to get their shit fit back, and send them a fleet &amp; ts3 invite.
---
I still see plenty of excavs on kbs daily
---
no, it's really not. it's absolutley retarded. it clearly demonstrates that CCP knows next to nothing about their own game or playerbase.
---
Give it time, they will figure out how to bot a response fleet if not already.
---
Honestly what I do and what others do are two different things. If the group I work with were to close up I probably won't be playing subscription games anymore.
---
EVE is a crummy game to play solo.
---
Do you even know how to read?
---
What is Average Joe in and average Joe alliance doing lighting cynos? 
---
0.0 is End game. Not newbie paradise it has become over the last few years. The vast majority of players should not leave Empire space due dangers and complexity of Null ( with compensation offsetting some but not all the danger ). How many Titans died ratting under super umbrella of either Goons or Legacy? Way too few and this is why we are seeing the changes.
---
even if there is umbrella, then there is huge PVE activity drop and it is pretty clear there are (and there were) no bots
---
The dronelands are untouchable because nobody wants to touch them.
---
You already have cyno beacons and a harpy fleet. you will not need anything else if dreads don't land on grid.
---
it won't. just will further entrench the power blocs.
---
I do remember at the 2017 EVE Fanfest some guy started chanting "BOSS! BOSS! BOSS!" but the crowd wasn't having any of that shit and rebutted "Who?". Laughter ensued.
---
The past several changes are for chaos
---
The activity has dropped a ton.
---
Do i need to explain this to you
---
First thing I thought. 2 t2 fit domis should pull in 15m ticks each, so 30m ticks. and t1 battleship insurance is great so doesnt even matter if you lose em.
---
plus tanked properly, theyre not exactly defenceless unless getting bomber-deleted.
---
That made me laugh so loud it woke up my girl. 11/10 will watch again
---
Damn... imagine depending so much on your alliance dropping a fleet of Titans and Supers to save your ass to play the game. 
---
This only shows exactly what went wrong with EVE the past few years; I hope this changes bring back (even a part of at least) the dangerous and unforgiving game I fell in love with.
---
yea I was thinking of something similar where either you restrict loud cynos to T2 cruisers and above or make them take a lot of fitting space
---
That’s incredible, not my deal but impressive all the same.
---
I really only done the steal drones thing once.
---
I was board near DT, camping the hole to our system, saw 3 Orca on dscan with aug drones out, saw they where still out when DT hit.
---
Spammed login, was in Helos with combat probes, scanned down the drones, got all 15 and cloaked as the Orca logged in and warped back to the belt.
---
I tried selling them back at 50% market price, got told to shove it.
---
&gt;Some guy who knows The Mittani
---
not really. you still have to get in. we'll still have umbrellas.
---
I've watched it 3 times. still fucking hilarious
---
what a valuable addition to the thread.
---
fine. we'll just send 5 cynos
---
I think the main goal of CCP is to make massive alliances consolidate. Has it worked yet?
---
Well thank you the all brackets thing is very useful, and now that it's enabled I'm going to edit the bracket content to show exactly what I want. (Who really cares about the player name in space? Overview's fine for that)
---
Especially the distance for all ships.. Usually I try to use the tactical view for distances but I prefer the numbers.
---
One of the line that comes from my ship, is the opponent's facing? Or from its ship? I think I now what you're talking about. I wish there was a way to make those lines in another colour. I don't have problems seeing the red "approach" line. I'll try to pay attention next time
---
Do you change the speed by clicking? And then a shortcut for fullspeed because that's useful.
---
I definitely did not practice speed change enough, it's hard to change it while manual piloting. I really hate managing to enter a plex and get out of scram just to find the guy overheating in the opposite direction haha. Even though now I overheat the disruptor at the start too.
---
When flying at 50% of your speed, an agile ship you don't lose speed when turning like you would at max speed.. That could make things easier
---
This patch is a Gift to EVE and anyone who pvps  its also a death card but that is why we play for content and there is going to be alot of it :)
---
What a time to be alive!
---
because CCP is firing off barely-started-baking ideas
---
I was messing around on sisi the other day and tanked one Frat dread and a carrier without heat. I did have implants but not most blingy. A 2nd dread warped in and that was pushing the tank, but it was holding with just occasional heat. 
---
Maybe their fits were not optimal idk. They were unironically belt ratting.
---
is ok. we just bricktank blops. we drop titan on u if u shoot dem
---
Needs moar jpeg
---
Why is it retarded?
---
When are we starting a pot?
---
It's a cov ops cyno...you don't lose a bomber easily if you are just lighting a cov ops cyno
---
yeah fight 100 SB with 20 munins let me know how that goes idiot.
---
Equal to the usefulness of your bitching and moaning
---
&gt; null pvpers: "hmm sounds fun maybe we can get some kills finally without the umbrella getting dropped on us? but force recons and blops seem like odd choices"
---
uh, wat? nullbears=null pvpers. you're confusing null pvp with blops gangs, who are mostly WH or lowsec based
---
Fapping like crazy.
---
maybe they should talk to the FUCKING CSM. that why they exist! ccp is fully gone stupid. it's all cuz the deadline for their metrics is coming up to get full payout from PA
---
You can reship into another recon/blops and be covert cyno'd back into system by a bomber at a safe.
---
Yeah, look at this posting. Mildly nerfing cap movement is resulting in enough salt to pickle a planet... These fucking nerds would bomb CCP's offices if they deleted their caps.
---
It's a direct slap to anything that's not full blown supercap blob - the less caps/supers you're going to jump, the more this change hurts. Biggest problems are arguably for moving supers and for smallgang cap/super drops, meaning less (and almost no fun) ways to use capitals and much less capitals in position to get shot.
---
 I tried to use a passive shield tank Vexor with drone damage, and it cannot deal with the quantity of the enemies that I am facing, either I try and kite while my drones go in then my drones get slaughtered and my ship gets ravaged, or I try and and tank the enemies my ship gets ravaged and my drones die.  
---
Can i get a good recommended fit for mission running tier 2 missions in a Vexor?  
---
Is it common to face 15+ enemies at once in a normal tier 2 mission?
---
we dont give a shit because we are cool like that
---
Our good buddies in frat have already coded the bots we will need to survive
---
Exactly
---
they're trying to kill cap gameplay i think. or they're really, really dumb. or both
---
Then CCP just need to ban anyone who Flys under their banner
---
or just, ya know, buff mobile cyno inhibs?
---
However, people are somehow awfully bad at this game and don’t immediately jump/bridge, and with a ‘proper’ if you will fleet comp you can blap a recon/bomber rather easy.
---
good luck opening a cyno on 20 out of position super carriers.
---
And then undock your alt to loot the wreck. Don’t forget that part.
---
It's literally less than two months. Did everyone inject into caps and don't know what an actual long train is?
---
Smartbomb or neut for me
---
caps warp slooow
---
Like the other thread, a tractor beam to drag in hunter salt when they lose heir bounty hotdrop ships
---
Yes, fair. I was more thinking if you caught a couple rorqs or a ratting carrier on its own, so I guess I was a little off on the "attacker" part. 
---
Wormholer btw
---
I was a little hesistent to include hics, as the "Theme" of cov ops ships being able to light cynos seems cool
---
Ohhhh ohhhhhhhhHHHHHHH yeaahhh. #NOPOORS
---
I can literally give you a step by step guide to killing bombers with very few HACs + one suicide dictor, since you're too brain-dead to figure it out for yourself.
---
1. Warp HACs at range to bombers. Zealots or muninns, doesn't really matter.
---
2. Warp dictor as close as possible to bombers, drop bubbles, and warp off if you can.
---
3. Start shooting bombers. A beam zealot can kill a bomber about every 10 seconds.
---
4. If you're within torp range, OH burn out of range and cycle your MWD as the torps get close. Even with painters on it, a heated HAC will only be taking about 10-20% damage from torps, so the bombers will be hitting like T1 frigs *at the very most*
---
5. Alternatively just shoot from the total safety of Aurora optimal.
---
6. Enjoy the experience of shooting fish in a barrel.
---
Not that hard dude. You're really really bad at this game. Maybe stick to shooting rocks in the future.
---
Would be awful if they bubbled 200km inline with the beacons
---
I don't even need to try very hard to prove you wrong this just happened like an hour ago. [https://br.inyour.space/?s=4613&amp;b=8740800&amp;e=150&amp;t=ffvvrab](https://br.inyour.space/?s=4613&amp;b=8740800&amp;e=150&amp;t=ffvvrab)
---
Yes please give some bones to adaptive players. Exploiting the current state to its maximum is fun and the game is complex enough to not have a single ship dominating.. But last changes made the game easier in the sense that we just had to switch ships to adapt.. Before it was an inconvenience because SP couldn't be bought, now it's not even that.
---
Except an “idiot” on this sub is anyone the majority does not agree with.  Outside this sub there are good discussions going on about how to respond and develop tactics for this proposed change to cyno.  All I see here are people thinking they will more easily get into Delve to kill ratters and miners (aka the moronic amateurs we’ve seen in Delve since the blackout) and those somehow seeing a buff to their play style...granted, Olmeca got his wish and how he got it just being the coffee boy is an accomplishment.
---
Can we see it for all regions? 
---
Just to confirm that this isn't cherry picked data.
---
The windows XP shutdown sound got me.
---
"Blops as hit and run are not weak, they are good, but other Covert ships just perform better while being cheaper and easier to get into."    
---
    
---
And that's precisely why we don't ever see blops in combat. If combat blops can be replaced with literally everything else and the job is done better AND with less liability, that means that they are indeed weak. Even disregarding the cost of isk and skill, I just hope they get buffed to the extent where they are worth anything at all for the mass of each one that moves through a wormhole.
---
how many legit dread bomb attempts did you see? Way too few... I feel like there is a connection with this
---
the whole point of this change was to nerf capital projection/movement. giving fax a cyno seems like a step backwards
---
oh SHIT... F bro... fucking F
---
You'll still have e-cyno at your home keepstar/fortizar but you'll have to gate your carrier now, gasp! Or you can ask a friendly recon pilot to light a cyno for you at the site (for a price maybe).
---
&gt; Also you don't seem to realise you can't just camp and ambush a target during PvE, which is what you do for plenty of PvP. So no, you can't.
---
What if you cloaked your defense fleet and bait with a pve ship?
---
&gt;cyno's on Faxs
---
that's stupid
---
I mean yeah because others lack any brain cells to utilize for critical thinking
---
 No combat probes? 1/10
---
It didn't... check dotlan historical numbers - it's pretty concerning
---
You all bitched for months about care bears and capital umbrellas in nullsec. Ccp makes it harder for crabs and now everyones loosing thier shit. 
---
Make up your minds damnit
---
Heavy Neut
---
True on the rorqs part. Rorq functionality hasn’t changed, panic still exists, so still have 6 minutes to sort everything, and only2 extra steps on your cyno.
---
naw, we full of vendettas, but not Vendettas
---
&gt; can I impose a small tax on goods that my members sell 
---
Yes if they sell out of a citadel that you place down. However, keep in mind most people know that if they can sell out of a nearby citadel for 0.05% tax, they won't sell out of your citadels. Taxing your line members seems pretty harsh when   
---
&gt;  I have no experience running an eve online faction 
---
Don't scam newbies mmkay it's bad
---
I don't want to do it yet... I want to implement more data from this month so it is more credible
---
ummm how would they not know that, there is a guy on grid that could tell them a warpin vector on grid. You know, the guy who is being ganked in the first place. Use your brain cells man.
---
that we opened up for them lol
---
I just want all the SP I spent on caps back lol
---
oh man this is your 3rd comment to me... you stalking me bro?
---
Oh they like money. If you buy on CCP's site in EUR, you pay as if 1€ = US$ 1. You can however buy a month on amazon for the correct price.
---
Don't try and correct him we know by now he can't learn things
---
What was fixed? The community is calling you out for being fucking retards. Nothing to fix about that tbh.
---
Don't take it personal, we typically stay outta local
---
Are you going to give recons a “emergency defense system” to make them invulnerable to at least 30 sec？
---
You can literally look on the CSM minutes where guys from Goons advocated against HAW weapons, rorquals, over powered capital usage, etc... but sure bud
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78407736/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78407736/)  this the astero boi?
---
hahaha
---
 lets break it down barney style
---
* Warp HACs at range to bombers. Zealots or muninns, doesn't really matter.  
---
assuming you have enough numbers to not feed if you land in a good place yeah you might do a little damage. if you start chasing them though you are now increasing their optimal due to how missiles work and they can kite you. and then you feed.  
---
* Warp dictor as close as possible to bombers, drop bubbles, and warp off if you can.  
---
OK bubble the bombers the dictor dies immediately and the fleet is bubbled for 5 seconds till they burn out or boosh away  
---
* Start shooting bombers. A beam zealot can kill a bomber about every 10 seconds.  
---
ah yes a zealot, they are in every major null blocs doctrines because they are so good. will also die in a fire if you don't have numbers.
---
huh?
---
Ah yes those bomber gangs that also happen to have two dozen kikimoras...
---
You can't seriously be this dumb. Did you even take thirty seconds to look at the killmails before linking the battlereport? Of all the Muninn losses, only **a single one** died to torps. Two died to bombing runs, and the rest died to the kikimoras.
---
Wow, what a convincing battlereport. A single Muninn down to torps. Sure showed me!

Oh they were crying. They were talling the same "oh this will kill the game" bullshit stories too.
---
you care enough to support proposals like this cyno change so it's easy mode for you
---
May bob forever bless you \o/
---
I hated null cus local makes everything easy. I also hate Kspace because everything is about numbers. That's why I enjoyed wormhole space. Stayed there for 2 years, it was fun.
---
XD
---
Classic GOTG :)
---
No and no, you'll have 5-10 sec window to go all in or lose the cyno. People would have to think and carefully plan before lighting the cyno.
---
Carriers are about as cheap as cheap subcaps
---
A few things that come to mind.
---
1) I need to cyno my nag into a farm hole Asap.
---
2) I like this, JF’s to Covert Cynos will make wormhole logistics 2000% better. 
---
3) big sp sink which makes it more difficult for veterans to have many but do-able if you don’t have throw away alts ya know? I’m cross training into theses, HICs, and t3’s.
---
the organizational ability of the blocs will completely neutralize whatever effect this is 'supposed' to have on the umbrellas. all it will do is discourage offensive use of caps. deployments are going to be a huge pain in the ass.
---
You understand that there is a sov structure that is an always active cyno beacon? Only deadbombs will require more than an AF fleet and a titan to bridge it in unbrella regions.
---
Yeah, you're totally right.
---
You were a mistake
---
A cause i can get behind!
---
Why not? It's not like it's getting good use.
---
You lost the shit-posting/karma whoring race... https://i.redd.it/cd4yalyvyig31.png better luck next time.
---
I was gonna go into an explanation of how wrong you are, but this post actually does a better job of illustrating what a dipshit you are than I ever could, so thank you.
---
Hey, you should try clicking those Muninn KMs and seeing what they actually died to.
---
Better run to Reddit to shit-post/karma whore about it.
---
Man, it's almost like ships are regaining their identity.
---
Small groups in null are fine
---
—wormholers
---
I agree and there is usually a drop in player count over the summer months as well comparing to previous years would show better data.
---
Khorne for the Khorne Kob!
---
every single one of those munins have SB on their KM so im pretty sure you are retarded. its really simple why the kikis are at the top. they hit their adc before the torps landed and but not before the kikis started applying.  
---
yes you are right that kikimoras arent stealth bombers. but they are used in very similar manners in stuka fleets. Bombers bar uses kikimoras all the time.
---
Why would I fit a cyno in wh space in the first place?
---
Possibly.
---
Fifty thousand pilots used to fly here, now it's a ghost town.
---
Cool man. I like how you said my thing. But like that meme. Nice :)
---
Whaaat really?!  Surely you’re justa whiney nullbear
---
there’s no way huge game shifting changes that benefit a certain playstyle wouldn’t see an overwhelming example of them
---
“Practically untouchable” zkillboard says otherwise.
---
link me a km from that fleet without bombers on it (hint -  there are none)
---
&gt; dronelands are untouchable 
---
I’m so sorry for your loss. Does being lonotomized hurt?
---
Thanks for the response. Just wanted to clarify my goal is not to scam newbies I just thought It could help finance a station for us.
---
# Festival Launcher
---
except we still will
---
There’s also a difference between small groups living in null, and small groups who occasionally engage in nullsec roams.
---
ngl the one part of this change I'm happy about lol
---
Just wait until they’ve gotten bored of “nullbloc” life then recruit them by the dozens with their Titans already purchased.
---
&gt; [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78425416/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78425416/) 
---
TIL that a Fort is considered a Super.
---
So let's recap. This argument went from your hypothetical covops cyno drop of bombers ganking a lone Rorq to, now, a mixed fleet of bombers plus kikimoras, command destroyers, tackle, and frig logi (none of which can take a covops bridge)
---
And this is supposed to be convincing.
---
but not before titans and faxes are in
---
I've been around the block a couple times. This is nothing new. People get accustomed to a certain style of play then CCP does something that completely wrecks it....like the sentry bonus on Ishtars. Remember that? OH the sky was falling after that, but people just adapted. That's what will happen now. People will adapt and change to the new Meta. I'm really happy about the JF changes. Being able to covert in under cyno jammers is going to be amazing for positioning FOC and putting armaments there for corp deployments.
---
Only way to fly :)
---
I expect maybe half a dozen safe cynos in key and well guarded keepstars.
---
i think you misunderstand there, falcon.
---
Funny how the SBs are usually at the bottom, wow almost like torps suck at applying to HACs or something, imagine that
---
Really tremendous stuff here, you are a PvP master
---
have you ever been on a stucka fleet?
---
I really want to see how blocs want to react against small gangs without a cyno on every Domi while we are still in blackout
---
ehh that's subjective, some of us find it more fun to fly caps than subcaps, but to each their own I guess..
---
it's making offensive use of caps... a massive pain in the ass. defensively... not much will change
---
I really don't get the whole "let's fuck up the game for the majority of the player base, its good for the game" attitude. Like unless i'm stupid I thought the goal was to retain players, not drive them off.
---
&gt;  Community shared cyno fleets are likely dead
---
nah. bricktank blops will be the meta.
---
Does Eve still have that site where you can bet money and have a 1 in 6 chance of winning a free ship or bpo or whatever?
---
I heard you guys talking on TIS the other night. I completely 100% agree with you. This change is needed and glad to see it's being done. Thanks for being a positive voice in the community!
---
To be fair, most JF pilots have full chains, often sharing accounts, plus you have to get that cov ops frigate skill, so you'd be looking at about 9 weeks for a full train for the route.
---
That being said, my cyno alts are so old that they got covops a long time ago so I'm not touched at all!
---
you know what an ADC is right? you know kikis apply instantly? you know missiles dont? its really not that difficult to figure out why the bombers are at the bottom. use your brain.
---
No, frankly I'd rather kill myself than being an F1 monkey.
---
Doesn't matter, because that's not what we're talking about, this whole retarded argument started with your hypothetical about a covops cyno bridging in a bunch of SBs, now you're just shifting goalposts to a completely different thing (a gang with SBs supported by a wide variety of other ships)
---
Jesus Christ it's like arguing with a toddler
---
This is a waste of my time
---
and maybe have lighting a cyno give a moderate tankboost or sth
---
Then CCP needs to add incentives to actually fight over space.  All we have are motivations not to.  Sov is a royal pain in the ass to contest as an attacker, and the defender has way too many tools to prevent an attacker from contesting it.  And unlike the passive moon era, there isn't really any more income to be gained by taking more space, since most alliances have more moons than their members are interest in mining.  Ratters and miners can still function in relatively populated space, etc.
---
I know it'll still be "possible" to use gank supers in a few select regions, but CCP has been pushing all of our spodbrained targets towards joining goons with the blackout - the nerf to cynos is just another nail in the coffin.
---
Take that nullbears!!!!
---
oh wait....
---
ccp just doesn't get it tho. they refuse to talk to CSM, and are instead just coming up with half baked shit and are throwing it at the wall to see what sticks.
---
Which is basically every time you're trying to kill a capital/super without having to bring entire blob with you.
---
Nearly every ship in the game can be invisible. It can't use cov ops cloaks, it just gets a speed bonus while cloaked.
---
and a ton of pvp for everyone else surroudning these engagements.
---
Catching isolated capitals, catching fleets with bubbles slowing them doing, using tactics and strategy to fight the enemy.
---
Seems like a whole lot of what people want when they think about this game. Not just "okay everyone take the untouchable fax cyno and follow the target risk free"
---
I've always thought that just bridging in 200 people to a fleet was pretty fuckin dumb.
---
?
---
yes.. give caps the AOE damage thing, be beautiful to watch all the looting frigs in the dread blob just get vaporized as dreads go boom &gt;:D
---
A cyno and a pair of FAX are pretty good counters.
---
Time to dust off my bombers and hunter-killers.
---
Thanks that'll be helpful. I'm not having much isk come in besides pi and gas sites and I'd like to have an alpha toon devoted to making isk do my main can stay in the wormhole. I am out of it currently and wanting to get back into the corps wh
---
Can an alpha account alt with the million skill points invite bonus do the abyssal site fit your talking about?
---
WORMHOLERS, OUR TIME IS NOW!
---
Thats why you tax rorqs and ratters.  To pay the pvpers to be willing to drop to save shit.
---
Feudalism is the ideal nullsec government.
---
Oh what? you have no experience with what you are talking about and no desire to learn? oh my you seem like an expert.   
---
Never argue with an idiot, they will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience.

Why would this hurt bigger alliances more in logistics? Jump freighters can jump to cheap cov cynos now.
---
I'm not aware of anything off hand that's as detailed as what I think you are looking for. there's an article on Eve Uni but I 'think' that just covers the basics. 
---
Aside from that, try to dig out Jester Treks old blog, he did detailed write ups on a lot of core mechanics, might be that he covered it. Other than that I'm out of ideas, maybe check the useful links and guides auto thread when it pops up again.
---
Look at the above post, sir.
---
I'm confused, I'm apparently a nullbear while you also agree that a certain type of ship is very dominant right now? Doesn't that make you a nullbear as well...
---
we are the goons. you will be assimilated. Resistance is futile. Your life as it has been is over. From this time forward, you will service us.
---
&gt;Lol ok, blackout + safelogging + covert bridge. A competent group you will see a warning 5 seconds before there are 100 bombers on you
---
Sorry can kikimoras and bifrosts take covops bridges now? Is this a new patch? 
---
Or, maybe, are you just shifting goalposts from the comment I originally replied to, like some kind of idiot
---
hahaha, good luck with that.
---
4 weeks, thats low balling it a bit dont ya think
---
Unless the raiders are smart and immediately drop a cyno inhib before you casually coast your cyno over, setup drag bubbles in line of gates or where they cyno comes in.
---
Yeah, especially because a blops battleship and a covops frigate would be the best, most mobile way to move capitals.  Except when the blops battleship gets popped.
---
Tbh gf super ratting. May wh isk remain eternal.
---
Praise Bob
---
uh, we're already reimbursing myrm losses. carrier, etc will have cloaked FR's or BLOPS ready to go.
---
......: i need you to step back and think about the context and verbiage
---
Prospect is an expedition frigate that can fit a covops cloak, not a covert ops frigate. Cyno prospect is dead.
---
It's for the greater good!
---
😔
---
My cyno network is for JF's, so I just have to spend some isk to get up to speed.
---
I'd very much like to see this data done for more systems to get a wider view of the game's health.  More data is always better.
---
I'm working on the math atm for how much isk injectors it'll cost to upgrade.  Probably 2-3b each.
---
PREACH BROTHER!
---
 I will take the large drop in pve for the much smaller drop in pvp.  Null should be dangerous.
---
i did exactly the opposite
---
Figuratively resubbing is just when you subscribe to the subreddit
---
I mean you'd have to be pretty damn petty and pretty much wanting to hurt yourself if you don't see this change is way to broad
---
Just take a break for a few months.  If they're really that bad, they'll be rolled back.
---
Yeah, after sitting on it a few hours this is my biggest concern.  A small squad of capitals and a few dictors can hold any area within 300km of them.  What are you going to do about it?  You're sure as hell not lighting a cyno next to them for more than 2 seconds.  And if the dictors are competent, you're not warping anything into them either.  With the current dictor mechanics, it's not reasonable to move a super fleet through a contested gate.
---
It'll be... interesting.

No no wait till they kill asset safety.

I think you misunderstand, it wasn't necessarily all three of those things together. it was any combination of them, and you can probably add whs to that list.
---
I think you need Cyno V to use amarr rookie ships.  Which some of us dummies have.
---
this is just going to make them lose targets. like, you want to make null a wasteland? this is how you do it. peopel are just going to start quitting the game. they'll go to star citizen. or elite...

good

So what part of fleet fights is actually broke?

Literally no one is complaining about fleet fights, but we're nerfing the shit out of them.
---
No u
---
What's a may may?
---
That was supposed to say rat. Damn autocorrect.
---
&gt;I know it'll still be "possible"
---
So they're not removing this playstyle...
---
Is that a dab?
---
No Rorqual has been harmed more than necessary in the making of this video
---
the playstyle of a shitty overview?
---
The current blackout makes covert ships much more powerful when it comes to ganking. But when they add in the new cyno changes the meta will be pushed to a point that will completely favors cov ops capable ships to the exclusion of everything else.
---
Never, if I can't shitpost on r/eve then what am I doing on reddit.
---
To light up the darkness
---
Yep
---
Think of the children
---
no not like that you sicko
---
no. they're not.
---
supers can still use cynos. carriers can still use cynos. dreads can still use cynos. literally nothing about that video would have been changed save that the cyno boat would have been a force recon.
---
Tbh, im all for limiting what ships can light cynos. Making it a specific role i think is one of the more logical ways to help with constant capital blobbing. It just seems wierd to use black ops is all.
---
Yeah but you can blap an Arazu. You can't blap a carrier in the same way.
---
Fill the cargo with PLEX
---
Judging by your post: Don't. I'm being honest here, it sounds like you don't have enough experience or enough knowledge to be able to successfully run a corp in EVE, and it's just going to drain your will to play and you'll quit, and no-one wants that.
---
Play for a while longer, and come back to the idea in a few months.
---
only if you have a lot of overpriced recons to feed, and only under poorly organized umbrellas.

---
youve never seen or used a cyno in your life have you
---
Other part of the community is calling them heroes, you know.
---
Faction? Don't think so. Only sec status.
---
I didn't say throw a dozen monkey wrenches into nullsec bloc life. I said spread them out everywhere. There's more going on in New Eden than rorqs and umbrellas and standing fleets.
---
Hang in there buddy.  there are prob people that love you that aren't considering.  I urge you to seek some qualified counseling or faith minister.  You'll be alright if you keep going.
---
Massive alliances rarely collapse from total defeat in my time playing. Mostly it's down to key people:  
---
1) Getting bored and leaving  
---
2) Changing their view of the community's goals and the community dispersing  
---
3) Deciding to destroy something from internal mechanics (BoB)
---
The people that follow the "keystone" players still want to play and just find somewhere else to go that, ya know, exists. So bigger places get bigger. The barrier to entry for creating a corp or alliance in EVE is massive and larger now than it ever was before. CCP seems to at least be trying to break shit instead of their previous goals... Considering how well they do when they build something they may actually succeeding more trying to 'disrupt'
---
Well, or you covops cyno in a blops, then the blops cynos in the fucktrain.  Cynos on the blops need a major reduction, and blops could use some more tank though.

 But I feel bad that anyone would have to go through this alone. Please reach out to someone. Anyone.
---
&gt; otherwise why pick them over recons ever
---
The main advantage I see is that Blops can create covert jump portals. So you could have a chain of BLOPS set up that can both send and receive ships.
---
Im a solo player and i can honestly say, that i couldnt care less about the updates. Free skillpoints are nice tho
---
Hey man, please don’t do what may seem like your only option. Send me a message either here or on discord (modXK#0001) and let’s talk.
---
um defense fleets are losing dps pilots  to that so it does work.    Remember the attacker has most of the advantages already against a small organization.
---
Even still, they are a lot tankier than a force recon.
---
A point of null blocs was to be the biggest baddest most untouchable thing possible to accumulate enough that nobody can beat you, you win the game. But that effectively happened. The blocs won. The game isnt fun anymore, people who lose arent having fun, it's not super fun for most people to continue playing a game on a save file where the game is beaten, if ccp changes gameplay so that the blocs are less optimal play, and more, a playstyle, the game is no longer over, and both groups can go back to having fun trying to win.

---
Just don't give up.
---
T3cs and bombers are not the most popular small gang ships. There are many ships that are used in small gangs. It could be the case that you experience lots of cloaky ships because you're around a large supercap umbrella that drops on everything.
---
If we're going to have risk it should apply to everybody. Not just null sec.
---
Exclusive pvp cap type pilots have been leaving since rorqs and cap umbrella became the only viable play style, see PL.
---
Now you have those people replaced with krabbing carebears who fly around in caps, press F1 against very small targets and feel good about it, let em cry.
---
Get help  
---
A week, a month, a year everything will be better if you just live well
---
Cynos are stationary anyway right?
---
So sig isn't as helpful.
---
I have a recon alt. There's no one crabbing in capitals to light it on
---
When did I welp a super?
---
Strange pooty is a bad thing?  Sounds like he doesn’t like it when people make lemonade.
---
Nope seeing a lot of different comps both in the attacker and defender side.
---
Cover ops are there sure. But lots of nano gangs or fast fleet facing off against destroyer / assault frigate /battle cruiser response fleets.
---
Or a rorq, fax, super, titan. Things that take an act of god to get removed from grid.
---
The harmful aspect of this change is that it alters the speed hunting cyno ships. It's not just the cost.
---
Except it isn't worth it any more. Because of the increased risk.
---
I wonder how Goons will spin this to be "hurting the little guy".
---
This seems like a pretty hard nerf to ratting under large supercap umbrellas.
---
In the business we refer to that as a 'retard tanked' ship.
---
Yes this change is going to hurt us so much more than the little guy, right?
---
This will have no effect on you. This change basically ensures that someone who wants to use a cynosural field generator (highslot module that magically summons friends) is now limited to specific hulls. Chiefly, expensive hulls. So someone wanting to utilize this now can't just drop 40 titans on something with an interceptor (stuff that happens fairly frequently now and supresses PvP heavily)
---
The action is huge. Congratulations on your victory.
---
You are a good bloke. I hope to one day meet you in real life.
---
Mothball
---
My pleasure.
---
I appreciate the entertaining content.
---
Dreads can blap the cyno at 100KM pretty fast.
---
"chaos" is code for change for changes sake. Blind change for its own sake is as bad as letting everything stagnate in terms of building long term success.
---
Except I haven't mentioned quitting once.
---
Adios to paying for my cyno alts then
---
Schneckt
---
Yeah. Which is why null sucks and there hasnt been a war for an entire calendar year.
---
I will gladly settle for a Recon kill if someone wants to try that while ratting.
---
The bait posts are getting worse.   
---
  
---
When you reach high school age, please take a creative writing course and learn about believable characterization.
---
an overall drop in activity isn't healthy for the game.  Now if it had been a drop in pve, and an increase in pvp, that would be something worth considering, but it was a drop in both.
---
Small guys don't generally cyno in fleets to defend ratters. They don't have a supercap umbrella on standby.
---
Besides, I will gladly blow up that Arazu when it lights the cyno.
---
/u/Olemca_Gold buff blops then plz ty
---
especially widow its trash now
---
Then you are better than 98% of null corps. Absolutely not standard across the board.
---
But youve touched on a larger point I was making. The only way to live in null, is to do massive, massive amounts of boring unengaging content. And since isk rules all, newbies have to do a lot of it, when all they want to do is have fun. Thus causing the player retention problems this game has.
---
Wow Classic, CS:GO, and Division 2
---
This guy gets it
---
Unfortunately, destroyers can't get the bombers because they are invisible.
---
Not true.
---
Its still used for pulling Concord off grid.
---
How do you call this a mild nerf?
---
Well we have already made a game plan 30 mins after the announcement so ccp can fuck themselves
---
I see roaming gangs in the area I fly in.
---
What area and group are you in?
---
Biomass and look for a more modern game.
---
Ya CCP has rolled back fozziesov after a few months. Or the three years it took them to undo the rorqual changes which are still not good.
---
FAKE NEWS!!!! black out is the best thing ever.....
---
I think you have a logic problem. None of the rorq lighted a cyno in this video, this was you being lucky. Now it's not about luck, rorq can't light a cyno.
---
So the change actually make your playstyle not relying on luck as they have to have a cloaked recon nearby and that gives you precious seconds.
---
Those 2 extra steps are gonna bring alot of incompetence to light
---
Huh?
---
When was dropping the single most overpowered force on someones head in a matter of seconds second only to god mode "fair".... oh its a troll post mocking that perspective. Nice bait!
---
And when someone gets off an alpha on the recon ship anyway, suddenly you will lose a recon, FAX and super.
---
Absolutely
---
You aren't going to be able to break them up with in game mechanics.  What you should be hearing is "oh, there are too many disadvantages to generating conflict, and not enough advantages to encourage it." and then clamoring to change that.  Make limited resources, have valuable targets that actually make alliances money or give a different advantage worth fighting over.  The npc sotiyos?  A good start.  Make more things like that.  Don't decrease the scarcity of things, but make objectives that motivate entire coalitions to shoot each other over.
---
As someone who like the exploration and vast feeling of space in this game, I hate this idea.
---
Shoot goons/etc. instead?
---
So that the blue donut completely crushes everyone? 
---
Aren't you better off asking why a reduction in size is needed, in the first place
---
&gt;  the less caps/supers you're going to jump, the more this change hurts.
---
Thats obviously untrue. If I plan to drop 0 caps, then it doesn't hurt me at all.
---
HI
---
To your first point, while I agree that it's possible for large blocs to organise around this, it does make it a lot harder.
---
Frankly you're never going to get the player to stop doing one specific thing short of removing it from the game.  You can make it a lot harder and require more effort.
---
To your second point, I think discouraging the offensive use of caps is a good idea overall.  Titan and Super proliferation was a mistake.  Normal non-cap fights are just as fun and honestly I don't think this discourages cap deployment much to begin with.  You can still have a recon with your fleet that drops your cap fleet along with your subcaps through a titan bridge to a destination.  You don't need to be on grid with the enemey.
---
All this is really stopping is:
---
* cyno bait
---
* using cyno modules as an instant defensive module instead of relying on fleet organized defence
---
* use of caps in scenarios where they are really nessecary (since now you have to waste a force recon or blops, instead of a rookie ship)
---
These are all good things.
---
Any increased hardship to players flying caps doesn't really bother me, subcap fights are more fun, and caps are supposed to be a tool that requires careful logistical planning to use.
---
A couple assault frigates vs a domi that actually is PvP fit with cyno and tackle and we deserve to be dropped by Haw dreads? You're delusional. It's not like I'm bragging about ganking miners and explo noobs. It's a fucking battleship that can tank a haven and kill haven rats with decent speed. It's not exactly helpless.  
---
I absolutely can complain that you morons drop caps on everything.
---
need a blob to shoot goons, and we only have like 2 or 3 sperg lords on comms
---
goons get saved, these people don't
---
Hey dude, good to see you're still around. How are wormbro doing?
---
You're basically saying "I don't like the change even though it doesn't affect me"
---
Not sure why you care.  I could care less if it affects goons or not, but this has meaningful impacts to *other* parts of the game it turns out.  People play in other regions than delve...
---
It should require fuel, don’t be such a pansy.
---
The real crime though is that the dmg is allready done.
---
Lets be really honest,  when you hunt,  and all you see is vexors on dscan or a Hel in an overcrowded region,  you know your odds or risk vs reward isnt favorable, 
---
so you join a big blob fleet and fly bombers. /FU
---
The biggest crime in this game is multiboxing,   the ability to own more then 3-5 accounts is what has broken its core mechanics.  We wouldnt have the issues today with the fact we have been multiboxing the shit out of it for so long. . 
---
Now ccp wants us to spend isk on cynos..  
---
/throws some isk at his stripper cyno toons,   problem solved.. next challenge ccp.
---
Those people are necessary for content to be regularly generated.
---
I’m upvoting you to negate the salty nullbears
---
First time I have seen a CCP post blocked due to too many dislikes.
---
Please set up perma blops cynos lmao
---
Also, can we get some more detailed data to see quality of activity?
---
It is exactly what he meant.
---
That is some eTough gold right there.
---
Restricting it to only faction supers or titans is a little too much still. How many do you ever see during a proper cap fight, not to mention the price. Owning and bringing one to combat shouldn't become a requirement, imo.
---
Perhaps look look into the different roles of each capital. Is there a class that could potentially fit a new type of cyno, that allows only other caps to jump to it. No titan bridges for subs? Or potentially even restrict that to supers / titans only, as it would make more sense to me if they had the ability to call in a capital fleet if needed.
---
Stop playing and posting then crybaby
---
How/Why is the system name like that?
---
I'm just your biggest fan
---
Awww
---
no they aren't. if they wanted to actually disrupt the meta they would be going after the null mega empires not making changes to mostly unrelated mechanics that don't break them up.
---
all of the changes have been very high impact on a personal/individual level but not even a blip on the radar of coalition level. they need to do something drastic directly targeted at mega coalitions with the intention to break their backs not just annoy them a bit.
---
Maybe if you're literally retarded
---
CCP will likely start selling ship packs for cash if that happens and cut out the krabbing for plex.
---
That would completely defeat the point. The main reason for this change is to stop your super tanky carriers and supers from fitting cynos.
---
Instead, you have to risk a somewhat squishy, but expensive ship if you want to instantly teleport a fleet in.
---
&gt;Let the toxic assholes and crybabies leave. We'll be better off without them in the long run.
---
Bruh, with alts thats like 80% of the player base.
---
1k dps, 120k ehp, not interior shield tank, can fit ewar, can mjd, and has a jump drive is pretty good tbh. I do wish they could warp cloaked though... that would be the real key to get them in the game comparable to t3c's....a man can dream
---
See, this thing where you fit a fit to literally every ship and it made you incredibly safe is the reason this is a good change.
---
I would only skill it for the ship I want to use. Thanks I'll check it out and try it later.
---
We had lots of content before ratting capitals were common.
---

I will be perfectly happy to just blow up these squishy recon cynos and moonwalk away.
---
You're either trolling or a fucking retard. It's a fucking battleship that can tank a haven and kill haven rats with decent speed. It's not exactly helpless. It has a good shot at killing us if we mess up and get into scram range and it throws lights on us.  
---
Dropping haw dreads on assault frigates is just pathetic.   
---
And you're an idiot.
---
I will just blow the cyno alt up.
---
Where?
---
But that’s not what reddit thinks
---
The salt is so tasty
---
Wormholer by (the) accident
---
Blops are not 900m
---
Good
---
Let me re-sign my 48 alts.
---
Scoots would have to log in to be a spodbrain. Well undock at least.
---
The counter is undocking your own pvp ships, how hard is this to understand
---
Then I get a nice recon KM in addition to the super ship.
---
Too bad your posting gave my singular remaining ball cancer
---
i think it would actually be really cool if they just deleted regional gates
---
Maybe responding with a ship that isn't a titan is what the developers and players want
---
You would expect a drop in activity following such a major change.  When they, hopefully,  announce it is permanent, those currently hiding under rocks will emerge.
---
Wormholer could talk in local if he feels that Bob demands him to do so
---
Yeah you have a blob. Congrats , 🙄
---
C4 space is literally hell that I wouldn't wish upon anyone
---
Jesus Christ you're a pretentious asshole.
---
Stealth in any PvP game is always cancer.
---
Blasphemy
---
That was fucking fun.
---
its a triglavian invaded System
---
That is what Providence tries to be.
---
Your lack of imagination means you'll always be food.
---
Dropping on renters won't change.
---
Now you can also drop under umbrellas and have time to get an inhib up. That inhib is the magic stick that gets you enough frag time to be dangerous to Goons and Test and everyone else. 
---
Like this is primarily a major nerf to cap umbrellas. You'll get more dread bombs in more dangerous places because they'll work more often. 
---
Like Waffles are buzzing with ideas on how we could exploit this shit to frag nerds.
---
What this does is shift the tactical landscape ~drastically~.
---
Just carry a full tank fit Recon in your hangar and if you get dropped a corpmate can warp to you at zero and board it.
---
For sure thank you for the brawl
---
&gt; But Pearl Abyss CEO Robin Jung said in an email interview with GamesBeat  that CCP’s dedicated fans have nothing to worry about. No changes are  coming at CCP and in its flagship game. The deal closes October 12, but  Jung, 38, answered a variety of our questions related to the deal.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;LOL  
---

---
Exactly. So it's not going to help capital proliferation. It's going to screw over everyone not part of a bloc. It's also going to discourage the kind of big fights eve is famous for
---
Except this scenario doesn't change.
---
You'd just have 2 hunters.
---
1 doc, 1 recon.
---
unban me from the discord
---
In none of the presented situations would a recon die...
---
Earlier, the main post gave the "This post has been hidden due to too many dislikes" button and i had to click to unhide.
---
The other problem is that bloos and recons are basically made out of paper mache
---
Yes.  
---
Because unless you're doing something wrong you're not going to lose anymore cynos, 15+ cynos from a bombers cargohold alone, and the cyno is only stuck for 60 seconds.
---
In my view, this is going to make it a hack of a lot easier.
---
You probably came up against haw dreads. Whereas the guy above is talking anticap dreads which will alpha through.
---
The only suggestion i've seen that makes SOME sense is a 60 minute cloak timer or something, where you're forced to decloak once an hour.
---
Fuel is fucking stupid. Literally making the game harder for no reason, and no benefit, when there could be other solutions.
---
Doesn't that kind of break the idea of having your own battle-station in space? I mean, right now the lore introduced citadels as floating mega cities so it'd only be logical that they have defences?
---
I think the list is too restrictive, but definitely having more dedicated cyno ships is good.
---
Nothing in game will break people up. It’s all conditional on relationships
---
Cap blobbing is overblown. It mainly exists because bored cap pilots. There's nothing to drive conflict among the blocs.
---
We are all glad to see you go. Please dont come back.
---
BLOPS ships being able to both bridge and cyno has its uses
---
Yeah, my account subs coincidentally needed renewal today. I stayed around for blackout to see where this rabbit hole would go, but, after seeing this and everything that's happening with CCP decisions I'm done. I was excited because CCP finally had the balls to make big changes and make some waves, but in CCP fashion they showed once again a clear lack of understanding of their game, an unwillingness to listen to players who've said these things were problems for years, often before they came out and  ignored solid solutions these players have provided for them.  
---
Instead, we're watching CCP throw darts at a board to make changes at random without seeming to understand the ripple effect of consequences these changes will make and that they are only changing these things and not balancing out the rest of the game. Essentially making several playstyles completely useless in the process. Less options is always bad. Always. And with citadels still being timezone tanked cancer, removing escalation chains removes the last reason for people to fight each other.
---
How long to lock a recon and blap it in an NSA Super?
---
The probes really need a rework as right now there's nothing you can do about them. In my opinion, if you see them on grid and are fast enough, you should be able to lock them and shoot them.
---
Stop crying. Do you prefer endless cap blobs and stagnation?
---
Thank you!
---
&gt; Except I haven't mentioned quitting once.
---
No dave, you just constantly whine on about how you only play long enough to earn your free sp and then do nothing because "its just not worth it".
---
Also the whole you not enjoying your null experience is more to do with you being an antisocial introvert.  Look into it bud its real and you're it.
---
Or those that left decide not to come back.  The metrics I have seen so far have not been encouraging.
---
Made me chuckle, have an updoot.
---
He's a goon. What do you think he prefers?
---
Capital tractor beam
---
What king of stagnation do you mean?
---
&gt;Well everyone knows a 300mil tax on cynos isn't stopping any null bloc from dropping caps on anything that moves. 
---
Until your cyno gets blapped after 1/3rd of the caps have jumped through and you welp a fleet.
---
Please bring back the gong.
---
A botting region and one filled with nullbears that are too busy crying to undock
---
&gt; No dave, you just constantly whine on about how you only play long enough to earn your free sp and then do nothing because "its just not worth it".
---
given how much time i have to play each day - that's what gives the most reward for effort invested in the time i have.
---
if that's an issue to you - take it up with ccp that the most valuable part of their game takes 5 mins and encourages you to abandon all other content in lieu of it.
---
Does it though?
---
\*raises scotch glass in YAAHHH and appreciation\*
---
Oh god, please. My bomber friends and I will thank you greatly for the free 1b+ kills.
---
Its not. I await your post.
---
yeah. it does.
---
i get to chill out and shoot spaceships, i get a reward far outweighing any other activity, and it can be done relatively quickly.
---
nothing else offers that.
---
Had me at first here
---
With the cyno change upcoming why are people stating bombers are now so great. I don't understand why the shakeup would do anything to the gameplay value of bombers. Help me understand.
---
&gt;  i get a reward far outweighing any other activity
---
10K sp hardly outweighs any other activity you insane drama queen.
---
for the time invested it's pretty much the best isk/hour activity right now.
---
Can someone give me an ELI5 about Cynos and the changes to Cyno that were announced today? Can´t read the post on website because its hidden (flagged by community). But to be honest, even if I read them I´d probably not understand them. Even with 2 months in the game there is still so much stuff that I know nothing about.....
---
Goddamnit....
---
Probe targeting point defense weapon, anti-probe probes, ccplease probe warfare.
---
Sounds more like a test, where Bob would demand you to talk in local, but in reality would be dissapointed if you did.
---
It's a photoshop of this https://zkillboard.com/kill/78425868/
---
And ? I’m not saying you have to. If you want to stand up against someone yelling at you for not respecting the rules of the corporation, alliance or coalition he created, that’s entirely your choice and I’ll respect it, so long that it doesn’t bother me.
---
But yeah, I suppose you can understand that some people get angry when they spent years cementing their space empires, just to see retards slowly destroying it from the inside out from simply not respecting the most common sensed and logical rules.
---
You answered your own question.  The majority of the players are off fighting in the 700+ player battles that you are actively avoiding.
---
Agreed, smuggler gates too.  
---
Maybe just take all the gates, make a histogram of all the lengths, and just eliminate the upper quintile, with no regard to the consequences.  
---
If the trigs and drifters team up to carve highsec and lowsec into islands, all the better.  They might just threaten the entire network, but perhaps the Jove will intercede to partially preserve junior civilizations.
---
welldone ? lol
---
What does "matter" mean to you and why do you think that its the ens goal for every group?
---
I'm thinking of large cap vs cap battles.  Probably long range dreads sniping the recon.  And how much do you want to jump your super fleet or dread bomb to a recon that's currently being locked by hostile dreads?
---
They're going to ruin YOUR game ;)
---
Do RLML profit from the bonus?
---
That'd be broken asf.
---
It's almost as if you can play the game without using jump bridges or something...
---
To move a cap you have to use a 300 million isk ship and make it sit there for 10 minutes. Anyone who comes along can pop your cyno force recon.
---
yes please
---
Please link a fit that can get those kind of stats that isn't some sort of meme 10b slaved blaster sin fit. I can't think of any other way to get that kind of paper DPS/tank besides maybe an obscenely blingy slaved Redeemer.
---
So, before this change was everybody using exclusively titan bridges to kill shit? If so, it sounds less like lokis and bombers are superior and more like everything is too safe if the only way to get kills is by dropping.
---
every blops accompanied by a boson titan?
---
Mining and Munitions Ltd (MAMLT) is a good mining and Indy Corp. They’re based in nullsec and are with The Bastion. I flew with them before my hiatus. Great group of guys.
---
... why. was that ever a problem
---
Because they are a de facto part of legacy
---
*This* is how you know you're walking the path.
---
Maybe you should have to protect your shit then? Owning and moving caps is meant to be a significant investment, and now it finally is. Get over it.
---
This is an even bigger change than Blackout.
---
BLUF: to mitigate the negative effects of this change, let Covert Ops Frigates fit Cynosural Field Generator I’s.
---
Pros and cons below:
---
1. Well, it will be annoying not being able to use Corvettes named “No Killmark for you” to move around my capital ships. I bet that annoyed a lot of low sec pvp types. But I can adapt. Overall +1
---
2. I’ve got piles of liquid ozone and Cynosural Field Generator I’s spread across multiple regions. All effectively useless now. It will take a lot of effort and investment to restock those way stations with Cyno ships instead of flying from one to the next in a travel Interceptor. But I’d like to see a more affordable Cyno ship than the Force Recon. It makes sense for that to be the Covert Ops Frigates. Overall +1
---
3. No more easily moving capital ships unless you are in a large alliance. Either you have to risk losing a few hundred million ISK Cyno ship, or you have to be able to gate your capitals. My foresight in moving Dreadnought caches to multiple NPC regions is paying off, but I’ll have to accelerate the last couple of moves before September. The “you must be this talk to play” factor just went up considerably. This is another incentive to consolidate into a big group. I think a better balance point would be to allow Covert Ops frigates to fit Cynosural Field Generator I’s. It will still be a potentially decent killmail, but not prohibitively expensive. Overall -1
---
4. This changes kills two of my favorite hunting ships.
---
RIP: Cyno Interdictors
---
RIP: Cyno Interceptors
---
This makes bubble-fucked dead end systems safer. Overall -1
---
Side note: I would love to see a new class of Interdictors that was able to fit Covert Cynosural Field Generators and take Covert Jump Portals. And with a bonus to cloaked speed, but no Covert Ops cloak.
---
5. Only 5/15 characters will be able to use Cynosural Field Generator I’s, but 14/15 will be able to use Covert Cynosural Field Generators. That’s kind of a strange situation. I’ll be damned if I inject or train all those characters to fly Recon Ships or Blops. Once again, I’d love to see Covert Ops Frigates able to fit Cynosural Field Generator I’s. Overall -1.
---
6. Safe Cyno fleet is effectively dead. Overall +1
---
7. Good luck evacuating if you lose your space. Once that is combined with no more asset safety and restrictions to NPC stations, people will have even more incentive to consolidate into the largest possible blobs. It now makes more sense to strip your fittings off your capitals, load the fittings into a JF’s, and self-destruct the capitals than to move them. Yet another reason to let Covert Ops Frigates fit Cynosural Field Generator I’s. Overall -1
---
8. Cyno beacons will become even better “bug zappers.” Lots more risk there. Overall +1
---
Fax: smartbomb
---
Rorq: Capital tractor
---
Dread: neut
---
Titan: anomaly generator
---
Carrier: FSU
---
Super: FSU
---
Why?
---
They are decent to rat in and have good statics.

blobs to kill the blobbers

---
i don't - if you don't want to be in a group that does worth while things that's cool.
---
you do you, most groups do since doing things that are worth while is the main motivator for most people.
---
It's about damn time CCP shook things up, and I doubt Pearl Abyss had anything to do with it. This is a moronic talking point.
---
Nothing easy about couple assault frigates vs a domi that actually is PvP fit with cyno and tackle.  It's a fucking battleship that can tank a haven and kill haven rats with decent speed. It's not exactly helpless.   
---
Dropping haw dreads on assault frigates is just pathetic.
---
rorqs can rep like a motherfucker.
---
&gt;no changes are coming at ccp and in its flagship game
---
erm, that is something to worry about?
---
If you plan on spending more time in WH space, I would recommend a worm hole mapping tool (unless your corp has already recommended one.)  
---
Tripwire, pathfinder, and iirc theres one more out there. Tripwire is better imo.
---
That "thud" in the end, lol
---
This is a feature and not a bug.    The post is just cloaked ready for Cyno
---
Cyno changes help small groups as it makes more things engagable. Blackout has been great!
---
and now the cyno that's bringing the dread DEFINITELY has a cloak.
---
lol
---
they do when you get drag bubbled 300km off of where you want to be.
---
Nice cherry picked data.
---
Right so why cant a group the size of say Rote Kapelle or Unspoken do something that's cool? What are *you* personally defining as cool anyways? Mass titan fleets glassing a region?
---
low effort bait
---
Atleast Matterall had his time in the public. Most Actress Careers ending was a  waitress or "exotic dancer" at the Boulevard Strip.
---
What you mean printing ISK for no effort?
---
And there was much rejoicing.
---
Sounds like you need to kill some bubblers to me
---
Well with the ventures gone have you considered faction warfare?
---
as i said a million times, if the problem was the super umbrella then just make it so only capitals/supers cant fit a cyno. and leave subcaps untouched. a noobship lighting a cyno to move dreads in lowsec wasnt ever an issue
---
Bullshit.
---
Every single one of those fights was an on grid cyno launch that could have been done with a force recon rather then a cheap as fuck useless astero or your nullified t3.
---
Cry some more.
---
 This is pretty objectively written. Overall +1
---
Why we have a AOE weapon already - smartbomb? Why not just use them? This also may finally find some use for the smaller versions, since right now there's nothing you can really do with them
---
Goons lost a MAJOR part of the strength that goons had which was an unbelievably strong super response.
---
They are going to bleed rorquals and supers now, hard.
---
Do you not realize the implications of this? Owning/moving caps/supers anywhere outside of the blob is going to get prohibitively expensive. Recons are fragile, juicy kills that people will definitely be hunting, and they can find them because the cyno runs for 10 minutes and is visible on the map.
---
If you are one dude or your corp with like 1-4 carriers, each jump is a 300m recon burned to provide the cyno. That gets really expensive really fast.
---
If you are part of a blob, and you are moving you 256 man supercap fleet, it's still 300m recon burned to provide the cyno. Sometimes this recon lives because the super blob scares away potential attackers.
---
Provi leadership instructed its membership to go into highsec to mine rat and incursion till black out ends so no wonder there was a 80% drop in pve activity
---
LOL ofc not.
---
That's not how the meme works
---
Agree entirely. 
---
One suggestion a corp mate made was making the fitting bigger so it's impossible to fit on frigates / corvettes (possibly dessies as well), while still restricting it to subcaps only. I thought that would be pretty neet
---
Maybe the point was a massive nerf to the cynos online meta? Just a guess.
---
Somewhere Dunk Dinkle is projecting his anger on newbies while complaining about the new cyno changes. 
---
Hope blackout is treating you well!
---
yeah because why use a super to kill a cap when u can just multibox 10 subs right. really makes sense
---
BBTB2 its nice to see you so concerned about everyone else all the time. When will you ever care about goons?
---
&gt;I don't have any toons in snuff
---
Well, maybe you don't but it seems that almost all your baiting is for snuff to kill shit, so if not Snuffed alts then just their pets.
---
Here have some gold u bastard lol
---
Third reminder; it's a fucking GAME.
---
Good fight guys.
---
I do think this change is chiefly aimed at people that fit a cyno to every ship they  fly in order to drop caps when in trouble.
---
Personally in LS it is a relief to know that even if that Maller is a BigBadAllianceInLS alt he cannot cuno a ton of titans on our 5 man gang anymore.
---
What's a t3d cruiser?
---
You thrash that strawman, buddy. No one needs the context of the full statement anyway!
---
Less "free" ISK and less krabbing alts because it's too dangerous is a good thing. In what economy is it good to pump billions, trillions of currency for essentially free? This had to stop and we're on the right track 
---
Even highsec gets nerfed by chaos. NPCs killing afk Orcas and such.
---
It's obvious the "generate free ISK" without much risk must end asap.
---
check out phoebe freeport republic or smth like that. 
---
basically no major bloc will allow a "freeport" that can be used as staging anywhere near their borders.
---
I literally could not care less. Caps are boring and have no variety. With the advent of triglavian ships for sieging there's no role where caps are a necessity. If this kills caps, so be it.
---
considering its a 1m skill to use it and a 40m hull, you'd need to lose what. 500/600 old noobships to make a difference? and thats assuming you train using plex
---
For a carrier trying to kill the cyno it does.
---
&gt; a noobship lighting a cyno to move dreads in lowsec wasnt ever an issue
---
Anything that makes caps too easy and cheap to use is an issue.
---
I'm a mainly solo pvper and I watch delonewolf all the time. I always love watching other aspects of the game I don't take part in
---
cool =/= worthwhile.
---
that would be amazing. also insta spawning the other end would shake things up properly
---
Creating your own demand. It's just good business.
---
also capital umbrellas didn't die.
---
you just have to have a recon cyno alt as well as a fax alt now.
---
Wake up, the decision is up to your master
---
No dude.  Cyno changes are a huge QOL improvement for LS small gangs.  
---
No longer can any random maller fit a cyno to drop 10 titans on your 5 man gang.
---
This is the rationale behind these changes.  
---
Null just cry the loadest because they had it far too easy for far too long.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Naggi7ufrLc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Naggi7ufrLc)
---
Making the fitting large enough that you basically have to dedicate the ship to that purpose would be good, removing the ability to meaningfully have it as a backup plan.
---
Or some kind of decent penalty to having it equipped that doesn't affect pvp uses much but detracts from pve uses.
---
Like reduces drone bandwidth.
---
Something like how WCS fuck with your sensors so people don't run them.
---
So Cynos cost like 800k?
---
40m/.8m=50
---
Not sure where you got 500/600. Really not about to include the cost to inject a covops in the losses. Last I checked you don't have to re-inject when you lose one.
---
which i agree, but if you think about when capitals became an issue its very very clear that neither noobship nor cyno mechanics were the issue. rorquals/sotiyos, skill injectors, and fortizars/keepstars were the major changes that brought mass cap/super spam
---
I think this is funny, you get the upvote from me
---
I'm not sure about complete ship dedication, but that would be a welcome change to try. I'd have to feel that out.
---
As far as reducing combat capability... Not sure about that one either, but what if you just couldn't lock or fight back once cyno is lit? All stuff that would be neat to try
---
What content? Zero counterplay to blob of Titans and caps roaming around fueled by rampant ratting under cap umbrellas. The only content they generate you get is you get to shoot 1 krab for 5 minutes with your 100 pilot fleets and then you need to GTFO when umbrella lands and you go back home after having taken dozens of jumps, before which hours were spent scouting and finding the closest wh paths.
---
It would also mean sacrificing something for a cyno. One of the problems right now is that a cyno has such low fitting cost that anything can fit it and run it. Making the fit cost more would mean sacrificing tank, or weapons, or something to fit it, and more cap means you can neut the other ship and prevent it from lighting it as well as not being able to  have it run constantly if you want to stop the afk cyno systems.
---
Holy shit, they actually did it
---
I might legitimately resub for this.
---
was factoring in the value of the sp you need (~1m sp from cyno4-&gt;cyno5)
---
its is, thats why u use cerberuses to defend it. They have like 1500dps each on C4-C5 :D
---
Absolutely agree with this.
---
I was more attempting to explain the poster's line of thinking, and you've put a lot of words in my mouth there, but I'm game:
---
&gt;It's almost as if you can play the game without using jump bridges or something... Is good old fashion flying through space not viable anymore? You can only bridge from one grid to the next?
---
It's apparently not good enough for the nerds that feel that other peoples' space should be a blind turkey-shoot. Why should the defenders be held to a different standard? Defenders dropping caps/taking Titan bridges are more restricted in their range, put significantly more value at risk in the field, and eat full fatigue compared to the 75% less the harassing force do.
---
It's obviously advantageous to project your force onto the field instantly. You know as well as I do unless it's a Rorqual or Supercapital under attack, that simple "good old-fashioned flying through space" won't get wherever in time to do any good.
---
&gt;I know "GRR GONS GRR" is a meme, but this seriously sounds like a Goon problem and not an EVE problem if you think that only things that can jump bridge are viable.
---
I'm curious what you think is a viable non-jumping/bridging rapid-response option to a jumping fleet of ships that has the undeniable luxury of only engaging the targets they wish to.
---
I'll happily admit my error if there is an actual, viable option that I've overlooked.
---
I know what you were doing. I'm saying it isn't a good idea. 
---
This isn't a dent in JF pilots' wallets. Anyone who says it is is just mad about the change
---
Read patch notes, mah boi
---
^^ THIS.  Have an upvote.
---
I wont argue with the numbers (prob close to right) but you are 100% correct. It may not happen right away but soon the market will see less of the "Nul Sec" goodies. Minerals as well. Good Ol' supply vs demand is going to happen.
---
i dont think its the end of the world, really. think people will move on to having few cyno5 alts with ceptors trained and buzz around instead of having a cyno4 alt/station. but its just frustrating to do that just because ccp wants to fix super umbrellas and as always they dont know how to approach a problem
---
No they really aren't. You just have to invest more and be creative now... Isn't that what most of the twitaly Dee faggots beg for on this sub or has it all gone to spod brain make the game easier mentality.
---
Oh the fishes will come back once their stack of isk stops increasing or starts falling.
---
yeah the adults that are moslems there will teach you how to beat your wife. lolz, sure thing homes, go get an adultz
---
Isn't 9 weeks way too much? You need electronic upgrades to 5, frigate skill to 5 and then cloaking to 4 i wanna say. All in all with cyno 5 included that shouldn't be more than 5 weeks.  
---
That is still an annoyance if you have multiple cynos chars on the same account, but it could be worse.
---
Agreed, and this is not even the end of "Chaos" Very hard watching these haphazard changes. BOB help us with whatever CCP does next.
---
What about Sort?..
---
Good fight was fun!
---
So its not chaos, its fuck nullsec. Chaos would be all over the place but CCP just thinks lets fuck on nullsec in several ways we can figure out.
---
First Drifters randomly attack and reinforce everything
---
Then remove local
---
Then effectively remove cynos
---
I can already see next remove asset safety
---
And everyone will just keep saying LOL FUCK NULLSEC without considering that as you keep forcing more and more players to leave nullsec (or eve) you make it so you have less and less targets to go hunt.
---
Yea, significant majority who leave haven't even heard or know of cynos, probably haven't experienced blackout because they're gone within first couple days roaming around in Hisec.
---
Hell yes.
---
The big alliances are built on irl people making connections. The loose connections between coalitions could probably be broken by in game changes, but irl friends aren’t going to abandon each other because CCP said they should
---
Good fight we enjoyed that. 
---
Also finally a hostile rag dies when pitts lights a cyno!
---
They will be one of the few cheap ships that jump freighters will be able to use due to the fact that they can use a covert cyno.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78425416/ didnt want that fort anyway
---
Please tell me you tackled his heavy fighters after he warped and killed them to mine salt?
---
&gt;Forcing cynos to be throwaway by painting them on the overview for 5 minutes is also fairly cancer. I don't mind if they die sometimes, but losing 300 - 500m every jump is even more cancer.
---
You could try, idk, not letting the cyno die? 
---
Now you're actually invested in moving such a large asset as opposed to being completely safe. That's a good thing!
---
L O L about Null being stagnated due to this or blackout.
---
What is actually stagnating null is 80% of null being blued up together.
---
Now, with these changes, there is some sort of counterplay against that 80% null roaming around bulldozing everything or dropping Titans on 3 guys shooting their krab bear. 
---
Hence, here you see the big blue donut boys being all critical.
---
I mean, Incursions have been around since 2010...
---
the country is poor as dirt, omg, you have no idea.... it has an exchange rate of 13,000 idr to 1usd, to put this into context, 13k idr is 13 dollars there for them, most of their meals you buy on the street from local vendors are 5k idr or 10k idr, that means that for them to play eve at 15usd they have to skip 50 meals just to log in, and that's not even mentioning the actual power outtages they face non stop, or the heat buildup that can damage their already sluggish machines overheating because most of them don't have air conditioning, or the terrible internet they have which by the way, that costs roughly 50usd a month and then the cost of the machines to run eve, which by the time they have all of that.. well.... you get the picture dont you? basically a 3rd world country. only the rich chinese or indonesians that have married them or somehow broken free of the class system or have parents in the government that helps them get into good paying jobs can even think of being able to afford playing this game, that goes for a lot of countries you would assume would have more people playing eve, but alas, this is just not the case anymore. not many people can afford to play this game outside of countries that have established some kind of decent quality of life for every person in the country, not just those that have friends or family in high places like these countries.
---
I wonder what the real numbers are on the adapt or die/more salt/can I have ur stuff crowd vs long term players who have been keeping the lights on at CCP. I believe the majority voice are the ones who have been keeping the lights on they are just being shouted over by others who never could make it in a Nul Alliance...so they cry "More salt" etc..."How does it feel krabs" 
---
Honestly, the comments that support Black Out and now the Cyno change that have also been not 100% drinking the CCP koolaid, most even keeled comments, seem to come from Wormhole groups IMO.
---
People already use long range XL weapons in fights, I personally still use it in lowsec fights, dropping 3 or 4 dreads  at range, 80 for pulse (running scorch) revs, 120 ish for Arty nags and beam revs ( I was the only one running Arty nags and beam revs in my corp/alliance so I used my own cyno. At 80km t2 pulse revs have plenty tracking to blap battleships under any kind of web, but we ran vindicators because 90% webs op.
---
Good to see Ratting income coming down from insane stupidity levels.
---
It does affect RLML, but Armour Cerbs have paper tank.
---
All gateguns deal the same DPS, which is omnidamage. If I remember right, each turret pair deals about 250 DPS, perfect tracking mind you. (May be 500 DPS, its been awhile...)
---
So working as intended, more balance to risk and reward.
---
It is a sad and toxic mindset. Hopefully the game will survive. If it doesn't I can say it was fun while it lasted. Fingers crossed here and will be watching this closely.
---
This would make it fittable to
---
1) Nullified t3 cruisers which makes counterplay against having cyno right on top of your fleet less possible
---
2) Cheap tanky ships (rokh, abaddon)
---
3) Most ships in game, which means solo roamers will be hotdropped again when fighting gnosises / hyperions etc. With proposed change when you fight some ships you can be sure they do not have a cyno and you might have intel on recons following you, which screams a "cyno".
---
Which, to be fair, I do not like at all.
---
Might as well go out with a bang.
---
This aint Elite, the heat mechanics are pretty basic, as how u/Milkymilkymilks pointed out.
---
I'm not even 100% sure if there are definite numbers for some of this, although some ships such as T3C's do have reduced heat bonuses.
---
Also, check the HP on modules, for example a medium turret will have more HP than a light turret and will take longer to burn out.
---
Are you a Signaleer?
---
That kind of idea sounds like our new Korean PA Overlords way of thinking.
---
I would suggest using ISK per Hour for your industry calculations.
---
Loving this
---
Marauders would be cool. 
---
Recon cynos for fast entry. Marauder cyno for a more solid entry that won't get alphaed off grid. Give them more of a role.
---
Might be easier to have a single-use, deployable WH generator that simply creates a new, random WH.  Would need its own ID to ID and could have random mass or be small/med/large and random or s/m/l lifetime.  It would need to be expensive though.  Could also be big to carry.
---
Could be restricted to one per system if designed for emergency exit or multiple if allowed to create WH chains.
---
Users might include WH or blops fleets, explorers, caps/fleets needing emergency exits, move ops willing to experiment to find travel holes or other creative pilots.
---
Unless they were training JDCV for blops.
---
And an extra bridger to get the hard cyno in, and the spare cyno to get the bridger in when the drop cyno dies. Not to mention two session timers.
---
You should also move while cloaked. Even with the -75% speed penalty you will move enough to not get decloaked if someone warps to your starting location.
---
He didn't move and I actually killed him few hours after he had cloaked.
---
Lol they don’t know that asteroids respawn every day
---
Message me in game if you ever wish for someone to ask questions to. Same as my reddit name.
---
1: Competition
---
2: Idiots who think that the minerals they mine are free causing them to lose ISK hand over fist by underselling.
---
3: Something like a procurer has a low skill ceiling, its easy to build and only requires T1 minerals. T2 manufacturing and some capital manufacturing requires a large number of skills, so it helps to counteract point #1.
---
About time
---
I think the cyno change is a net positive too. But i feel like the blackout and cyno changes being positive ones are at this time randomly good luck. And it's just a matter of time before they do something catastrophically dumb.
---
They bluew my Gila in a deadspace abyss, does it count?
---
Man this has it all. Different asteroids to choose from, mining lasers, space bees and a really hot chick.
---
Uh, no, structure insurance it not a thing.
---
Asset safety is where everything that is not in a corp hangar is transferred to another station if yours goes boom, you only have to pay a small % fee.
---
(NOTE: There is no asset safety in wormholes)
---
*bots
---
The Initiative - what else?
---
they are poor as dirt, omg, you have no idea.... it has an exchange rate of 13,000 idr to 1usd, to put this into context, 13k idr is 13 dollars there for them, most of their meals you buy on the street from local vendors are 5k idr or 10k idr, that means that for them to play eve at 15usd they have to skip 50 meals just to log in, and that's not even mentioning the actual power outtages they face non stop, or the heat buildup that can damage their already sluggish machines overheating because most of them don't have air conditioning, or the terrible internet they have which by the way, that costs roughly 50usd a month and then the cost of the machines to run eve, which by the time they have all of that.. well.... you get the picture dont you? basically a 3rd world country.
---
As someone who did nano supers in drones for like 2 years, you wont be able to do this post cyno change. CCP should really just remove cynos from caps and leave them on subs tbh.
---
Ah I recognized him from his porno career as “Big Salty”
---
Ill get downvoted but clearly you've never done this kind of pvp.
---
My guess, CCP dreaming of a specific scenario where recons would be bridged in through covert cynos to light their own cynos for a cap fleet and the BLOPS sits back as the extraction cyno for said cap fleet.
---
&gt; Now you can also drop under umbrellas and have time to get an inhib up. That inhib is the magic stick that gets you enough frag time to be dangerous to Goons and Test and everyone else.
---
Don't kid yourself lmfao.
---
Then break them up! Get you and all your buddies from the game...this time with no casino ISK, and break up who ever you don't like. Don't just throw your own salt on the pile and say the game would be better without A B C Alliances. Don't expect Big Daddy CCP to do your dirty work. See this is why most of players with your train of thought like this Chaos shit. Because CCP is doing what you could not.
---
Not as painful as cap ships 5
---
The fact that you now have to have an alt plexed for the sole purpose of cyno is retarded. I should never have to have two active accounts to enjoy the content of one active account.
---
Eve tourism is really fun. Thank you for sharing.
---
Your ship does not need to be stopped
---
... by the devs straight up deleting it is the antithesis of eve
---
They do, that’s why this change was made.
---
Not really? Remember, you still have alliances that happily pay for ship replacement program, they can add Force Recon ship to the list just as easily and raise overall taxes slightly to compensate for increased cost.
---
This change seems to only be strengthening the nullsec coalition rather than assisting a smaller null-sec alliance.
---
&gt; what if you just couldn't lock or fight back once cyno is lit?
---
This hurts pvp more than it hurts the main issue people have with cynos right now.
---
Right now the big issue is that you can just be doing your thing and have a cyno for if anything goes bump in the night.
---
That's the major issue.
---
So you can be ratting in your super or mining in your rorq and just have the cyno there. No sacrifices are made but you gain the umbrella.
---
so anything that only matters AFTER the cyno is lit doesn't address that issue at all.
---
CCP is not shaking up the game, it's shaking up the nullsec.
---
You know, the place which only has ~20% of all EVE players?
---
This solves nothing except making nerds - most of whom don't even play the game at all - very excited.
---
Well I mean, this is the "cHaOs ErA" so, might as well come up with silly ideas aye?
---
Don't people already use sins and widows for DED ratting?
---
of course, but You could also off grid cyno just like the first clip in this video shows.
---
just send the dic in, cyno the supers off grid and warp in.
---
Especially now that you know the carrier you are dropping won't have a cyno to bring in more suppers than you did before yours get there.
---
sure, but silly ideas don't inherently bring chaos.
---
That's your opinion, if I say highsec is crap dues that mean ccp should change it?
---
This change buffed the same group the local blackout buffed, pvp players who want easy shiny killmails.
---
Here's a sillier idea that does being chaos!
---
You can no longer select which cyno you jump to. Every time you hit the jump or bridge button, you jump to a different, random spot in range, so long as a cyno is lit.
---
*laughs in Jump Freighter*
---
" We cant waive our unmatchable cap blob (backed by 80% of null) as freely as before, I really enjoyed our 1-way content :'''("
---
The nice thing about force recons is that they can cloak. So they can already sit on grid with the rorqu ;)
---
...same
---
It’s not gonna take away our umbrella for super ratting and mining. Cyno might just take a couple extra seconds to light.
---
there are null pvpers who are not bears. look at tribute, and arguably groups like pl and init who do bear, but are not about bearing by and large
---
lotta retards in this thread think that blops can warp cloaked.
---
I’ve seen (and died to) people roaming solo null solo in battleships, it feels like 2007.
---
Legacy just likes them because they keep HTP/TRC busy with other things besides messing with legacy itself. They’ll keep Provibloc in place just to provide a buffer zone, but it’s not like cva routinely batphones legacy, and I don’t think legacy ever batphones cva
---
Dude just open cyno and reee web your jf, insta warp ezpz
---
Well it was 4 years of titan and super meta to the exclusion of everything else.
---
I'm ready for 4 years of bomber dominance.
---
oh donald...
---
I think better chaos would be that you can target the system that a fleetmember has a cyno in, and you'll land at a random cyno in that system.
---
Best chaos, every time you light a cyno, it lights somewhere random on grid
---
&gt; Making the fitting large enough that you basically have to dedicate the ship to that purpose would be good, removing the ability to meaningfully have it as a backup plan.
---
It doesn't remove it as a backup though, it just moves it... onto an alt that you have somewhere nearby while you krab/camp/whatever.  I don't think these are bad ideas, nor are penalties for equipping cynos, but they're easy to get around.  Making it so only pricy ships can fit cynos at least forces people to risk something of value if they want to threaten attackers with capital ships.
---
You literally have to be retarded to lose a Cov ops Cyno ship while lighting
---
Reduced faucets? Looks like working as intended.
---
&gt;jettisons recon to cyno    
---
&gt;forgets about agression timer   
---
&gt;force recon just gets popped    
---
&gt;welp dot png
---
So, I’ll just explain what cynos are, just to make sure you’re getting everything. From the release of capitals until now, they have always been able to go on any ship, and when active they consume fuel and make the ship lighting it completely immobile. 
---
After the upcoming changes, they can only be fit to two specific classes of ships, black ops battleships and recons. These are expensive, and aren’t normally frontline ships in heavy brawls, so alliances will have to bring in a couple specific cyno ships rather than just having a cyno on a scout or something. And since they’re expensive it makes bringing in caps a little more risky, since the people you are dropping on could just kill the cyno ship and escape.
---
uh, yeah, and look how PL is doing these days. tribute i can't speak to, but ill bet they bear quite a bit.
---
Ha ha
---
Ok update...I can only do up to t2s reliably with my skills/ship sets. I'm a drone heavy guy with missiles secondary (non gila yet) and the finger ballet necessary launching and landing drones is exhausting! Clearly the guys to grind these for hours at a time must be flying non drone boats!
---
Basic miner
---
I don't know how to say this without coming across as rude ...
---
You're saying that it's going to screw over evreyone that isn't part of a bloc why?  You're part of bloc, you have no idea what people think who aren't part of a bloc (me). 
---
Also, you're saying it's going to discourage big fights.  Why?  If it doesn't affect blocs, then you'll still have the bloc level fights (which are all of the big fights to date).  Additionally, even if caps didn't exist, you'd still have big fights.  We have in the past and will continue in the future to have big fights, with or without caps.  Subcaps work just fine...
---
I really don't see the problem with either statement.  You're saying that blops and recons being weak is a problem why? 
---
Having to be careful about your use of cynos because they're fit on weak ships seems to make sense.
---
Woosh
---
Just turn them into on/off modules maybe?
---
&gt; It doesn't remove it as a backup though, it just moves it... onto an alt
---
Which has a cost associated with it. That's the point.
---
And then it would be black ops online. People need to get it in their head it's a t2 vs with t1 resist and weaker tank then the t1 version. The bridge is its reason for being. If you want t2 resist dps and tank grates it's called a marauder use that.
---
Heavy LOL
---
Kind of pointless. People will just train up to a t1 cruiser and cyno's will just end up costing a little more. Take a maller and slap some t1 armor plates on and you can't even quickly kill them on station's anymore. That would make it kind of garbage.
---
It needs a specific list, and recons are good..but the blops battleships is a weird choice, considering they are super expensive and have poor tank.
---
Literally impossible and the rapier will always die
---
Apparently
---
Technically, you only need two cyno alts.  One to fly a stealth bomber with covert cyno, and one to fly the blops with a hard cyno.
---
Yes that's what I was thinking all WH sig everywhere
---
Couldnt agree more man. Maybe not the best decisions but its nice to see the devs making a good attempt to get the game back on track
---
Time for Episode II: Have a Recon.
---
No.  How about we just remove caps altogether.
---
Caps blow, the game would literally be fine without them.
---
you'd probably be surprised how little krabbing we (pl specifically) actually do. we can't even force people to rorq mine, even before the blackout
---
a lot of pl came from a time when you didn't krab in the alliance, in the space. they've got other income streams like high sec alts, market speculation, reaction farms, etc
---
I like your style
---
Well, judging from the killboard: Continue to be afk
---
&gt;it’s not like cva routinely batphones legacy
---
Yes they do
---
You're not answering my direct questions.
---
Don't change it
---
You asked me why they couldn't do something cool.
---
I never said they couldn't.
---
What about giving cynos a charge up timer? Say....5-10 seconds depending on your skill level?
---
No i asked you for your definitions of relevant ad cool. Still waiting.
---
You can get them warping pretty goddamn fast with rigs.
---
Thanks I didn't realize that for some reason I thought they could use covert Cyno.
---
Best part is where he brought a bowl of water to fight a blazing fire, and the water he had in the bowl looked like it would have fit in a glass.
---
I agree with your general idea. But i also think there should be a balance. We shouldn’t have a “it’s perfectly safe for this side, and no way to counter it from this side”
---
\&gt; The better part of a decade of continuous buffs to the static null-bloc playstyle, including the Rorqual, skill injectors, and citadel mechanics.
---
I sleep.
---
\&gt; A few months of experimental changes that CCP is willing to roll back that require nullblocs to adapt their strategies to a changing New Eden.
---
Real shit?
---
I wonder if they thought through the actual effects of this change. CCP mentions that the big reason for the change was to create more challenges for veteran players, but it will do the opposite. Veteran players that are established and have a crap ton of isk will be able to afford a force recon ship in order to continue to drop massive capital fleets down on their targets (or in defense of other ships). Not to mention the Null Sec Blocs which will struggle the least due to the change (and have the most capitals). But for small Corporations/Alliances, which typically have some of the younger players, and far less people, being able to sustain Force Recon losses (as they'll be focused the moment they're spotted) will become unsustainable for newer players, thus giving the veteran players another advantage.
---
Absolutely terrible change to try and fix a problem. Not to even try and mention the issues that come in with logistics and jump freighters. CCP even mentions in the original post that they'll have to closely monitor it because they aren't sure how bad it can be for logistics and JF'ers.
---
I dont know exactly which part you want me to read but its a 2 part deal. If I remember the numbers it was 250m last october with an additional 200m this october based on metrics. 
---
Thats why it doesnt make sense for PA to help CCP make money before october is up, quite the contrary, they will be happier if CCP doesnt reach the metrics and will save tens of millions. After october however it will start to make sense and they will most certainly be engaged more.
---
You forgot Lockley Theo:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkrd7iCt4Kw7DaO37_3xnNQ
---
Titans were becoming the meta in 2011 when I took my break from EVE, its been a lot more than 4 years
---
You dont see the big picture yet. You will understand in time.
---
whats wrong with you dude?  "more tears, more salt" is this the only thing you care about?
---
Good post. Thankyou for taking the time to calculate this!
---
First reminder, people get involved on a big level. Screeching your first point on an higher tone won’t change it :)
---
For once he isn't talking out of his ass
---
You speak English, you know what those words mean.
---
This is the only way to actually hurt blocs, by forcing their members to leave. And it feels massively intentional at this point. I think CCP for reals think that this regression will mean old PCU numbers but thats something they will never get, quite the contrary, its gonna be the lowest PCU numbers ever.
---
Calm down kid. I believe you, you learned what timezones and UTC are. Good job!
---
In the long run, yes, it will affect you. But not right away and not directly.
---
... Just Join Bombers Bar?
---
No see im asking what *you* perceive as cool and relevant, and you're beating around the bush
---
Its even more, its about 40% (last numbers I heard) of the game. And honestly, if you actually start to discount bots in HS and LS you will probably push that number far above 50%.
---
Nope
---
Marauders definitely need some love. But just imagine tryin mg to hunt in a bs. By the time you warp your target is gone probably.
---
So is this how we get all out war between nullsec and the empires? The Caldari State tries to drop on snuff, gets counterdropped, and suddenly the entire Imperial Legacy Coalition are on their way, along with the Gallente, and next thing you know Concord has broken, all 4 empires are back at total war with each other, and triglavians are starting to fully occupy systems unopposed.
---
Confirmed triglavians are snuff in masks
---
Yeah, imagine if the devs had straight up deleted the passive moon mining system that put the last dominant alliance on top for y-
---
Oh wait.
---
So, did you initially think the bait proc would win and end up surprised it lost, or the other way around?
---
Oh hi john
---
You can still do it, your only change is whatever cyno's the stuff in.
---
if i buy your company, do you think i will let you do whatever you want in your game or i will try to get my money back in 3-5 years ? :)
---
Wspace has em, and the drops are dank
---
So doing drastic changes and having the players who live in null move to high sec or quit is a better option? Wont even be able to scrape the myrmidon ratter kills at this pace
---
Man, we would have loved for that invasion to happen. Atleast it would make the drifter BS not be utter shit. Imagine if trigs would attack each region with a massive force, enough to make people actually fight for their sov. If you lost, you would have to leave and trigs establish a presence there. If trigs lost they would move to the next region.
---
That would have been such a major shakeup for the game, introducing a whole new era.
---
Instead..
---
&gt;No more easily moving capital ships unless you are in a large alliance. Either you have to risk losing a few hundred million ISK Cyno ship, or you have to be able to gate your capitals.
---
Exept you can just use a cov cyno bomber, fly to your destination, covert bridge a recon in and light the cyno. Takes like 4 Accounts to do, but you won't risk your Recons jumping though gates.
---
Not sure how you think this disproves anything
---
They are terrible to rat in. But yeah, they have the best statics, and a static c3 is way better for ratting than living in a c3 is.
---
Arty mach's are gonna be hot for cyno popping
---
You think Snuffs gonna stop dropping over this? There were ways to handle that specific issue that didnt ruin capital warfare completely.
---
Arent the jove kinda dead?  
---
Or was that just their gate network that did die?
---
I feel like the person with Rigging skills, Sensor Comps and the ewar cap usage skills being trained to V in their queue has enough SP that they've done some cross training in the past.
---
Also blops use JDC, so theres some subcap use even if you're strictly "Perfect Subcap"
---
Not really. I'm not making up words here.
---
I haven't said anything that needs explaining.
---
Okay dude
---
Tbh a rattle won’t get you your isk back in an hour of c3 krabbing, but that’s what the praxis is for
---
Honestly man, it doesnt even matter anymore. CCP has their roadmap planned and nothing is going to stop that trainwreck.
---
Your potato quality is more potato than mine, I thought everything on low was as low as you can go.
---
How did you do this?
---
It was really funny watching Init cyno in a fax and a muninn fleet (led by Pando, no less), to save a rorqual only to get eaten alive by stukas. I would have thought that pando of all people would have seen that coming, but I guess not
---
I know you all want the problems solve in one day, but give them time it's the time of change and more to come! :D
---
Sure it will. Rebalance resources so the whole of null can only support PvE in subcaps, and the more people who are using a system/constellation for PvE, the worse it pays.
---
That will encourage the turbokrabs not to join the biggest blobs if they want the best income available. Right now there's no incentive for a krab to join anyone else.
---
When something is exploitable people will exploit.
---
love the salt in forum.eveonline atm. better then reddit for now
---
How has this isk hurt you if I may ask? I see a lot of people complaining about it, also disregarding completely that WHs are a much bigger faucet/capita than NS. But how exactly are you being hurt by it?
---
You act like Init hasn’t already been doing that. 
---
Really, it’s booshers that are overpowered. Between boosh bombers and boosh ravens there isn’t much that can counter a good boosh fleet.
---
This will not hurt the small guys just you retarded "UMBRELLA PLAYSTYLE" ... because small groups don´t need cynos!
---
eve online is sinking ship. Rin away. Run as fast U can.
---
It will make Goons less likely to drop a super carrier on your Heron because they find it funny.
---
The game will always survive, you can always scale down to allow for bare necessities (ofc up to a point). But I think the game just lost its chance to truly shine. But like you say, it was fun while it lasted. I personally would have wanted to choose when to stop playing the game instead of being forced but other than that it was a fun run.
---
Spectre did? Kinda wondering, why spectre seems to have such a hateboner for provi, since years lol.
---
Well yeah, you can't half do something you either do or don't.
---
It just becomes the point at which it crosses that line.
---
It's always good to be reminded why I gave up on that shitpile years ago
---
exept you still cannot escape the Umbrella since now every Rorq will just have an Arazu at 10km. I would have loved the Cyno change if the Cyno function was on combat recons, black ops and Marauders so there was no cloaky way of bringing in capitals.
---
Glad CCP is doing these changes while they still can.  Game is getting too many people like the guy who made that post.
---
I think he is saying that these targets wont be available anymore. The video doesn't make that very clear.
---
CANES TO IPX
---
&gt; find another game to play
---
No wonder space feels so dead these days
---
That choice of ships....
---
more like a portable structure to allow large scale invasions of the wormhole space from K space or VS J space without mass limits.
---
Perhaps you haven't noticed, but there is an EVE beyond Delve. In Providence, the "pvp players who want easy shiny killmails" are the guys dropping caps on everything that moves, and the rest of us are largely using subcaps.
---
The reality is that this is a balance to capital vs subcapital PvP which encourages people to stop using the laziest possible response to end a fight.
---
I think he is saying that these targets wont be available anymore.
---
legacy batphone cva LUL my sides dude thats a good one. however cva does call on legacy every now and then usually when wrecking crew drops supers on them.
---
This post was flagged by the community and is temporarily hidden.
---
&gt;we are missing a T1 hull for cynos
---
exept there are T1 command hulls so you already covered that.
---
the idea is to now have a mass limit but time limit and the ability to kill the structure. The structure should be killable like a portable inhib etc. but with a bit more hp/resis profile.
---
Talking to some of those elite nano peeveepee guys, content is still bountiful. I do suppose if your head is in your ass you wouldn't know.
---
A dread under a large stealth bomber fleets dies in seconeds. How long do you think a battle ship would last ?. While it cant move to mitigated  damnge against them battle ship sized weapions.
---
No matter how tanky you make a blops there tanks leave them as a throw away 1_2 billon isk cyno.
---
Haha I do have to say, your comments tend to make me chuckle. Fanboy here!
---
:shrug: Dread bombs will be more viable after patch day then before. How effectively we'll be able to take shots at goons remains to be seen.
---
wow i never thought of that amazing....
---
Nope. I doubt you would manage this even with your own FAX alt, let alone having to call in reinforcements.
---
Astero has enough mid slots for prop, data, and relic.
---
Sisters launcher and probes.
---
Armor-tanked low slots.
---
Thanks, thats a wonderful explanation!
---
Salvager
---
But that doesn't make sense, because those targets aren't using a cyno in any way that the change is about.
---
I recently started playing why do you say this?
---
to sell them somewhere else
---
I have no idea why he decided to use this video to make that point. Just saying what I think his complaint is.
---
Oh no, imagine not having an instant escalation to a nano Rag.
---
Weren't you the guy who tilted over a 10% markup on medium trimarks?
---
Your comment is astoundingly misinformed and pretty much screams that you're still tilted.
---
Strange, people said the exact same thing about the blackout but that was wrong? It is in this case though right?
---
If you have the numbers to make machs work against a rorqual AND you have the means to get them on top of a tackled rorqual under an umbrella.
---
That’s what the prophecy trailer was about 😳
---
Mate, if you really say that there were many people saying the rorq is gonna be OP you are either lying to yourself or you simple have no fucking idea! 
---
There are currently rarely bots around
---
But yes, I don't have a cap, yet. But I do play this game, and I AM actually in hunter groups from time to time and this change is affecting me perfectly.
---
Anyways, all I want, is that people stop freaking complaining and wait how it plays out. Especially a change like this, that is depending on meta shift etc. 
---
I would really like to stop the discussion here, and restart it in 2 months. Then we will see the first effects it had. (not the huge fight escalations probably, but the small/medium ones, as well as daily JF stuff) 
---
Can you make a "remind-me" bot? I don't know how that works.
---
Death to spod
---
Dunno, I refit my caps based on what I'm doing with them at the time, so it's just another high slot to use for utility.
---
you probably still wont get that after this change tbh. The null masses are so heavily consolidated and rely so highly on pings and structured fleet comps that if you do get a subcap response its going to be 100 harpies or 100 muninn. Nobody thinks for themselves or creates their own content. I hear lowsec is good for that tho.
---
Where’s your snuff tag?
---
Ignore him. He's upset that the game is too hard and has taken it upon himself to try to stop new people from playing.
---
EVE is changing and he's failing to adapt.
---
They probably don't know that you can use them remotely. I suggest you stop wondering about strange people or you have a lot to do not only in eve but everywhere. Or you start to be really curious and study psychology ;)
---
...*my god*
---
What did they say about the blackout thats the same?
---
Honestly, its patently obvious to me that blackout is awesome.
---
However, there is some serious balance work that needs to happen in nullsec to get people back out farming.
---
Or a dropper can jump out of their bomber and board it.
---
C4's next.
---
from what i can tell there is already a significant reduction in the amount of botting activity due to blackout. although i did find a nice botting myrm group in Cache that has a 10min reset timer and have been making life hell for him.
---
That was totally unrelated, Horde jumping caps through Ansiblexes and using all the fuel.
---
keep your eye on articles in eve forum and eve news site.
---
and Dont flex on account. be careful
---
More likely after the couterdrop the node would collapse then Concord NPCs would start spamming this subreddit with meme posts about Socket Closed errors whilst the Caldari State NPCs would whine on the forums.
---
OP probably means the T2 command ships, not the T1 battle cruisers that are just bonused for boosts
---
Move to c5 space, make a shit tonne more and reduce risk. No Black Ops to cyno on you there.
---
I'm actually going the other way, training cyno alts into Prospects and then turning them into mining alts when they're not cynoing.
---
&gt; Not very tanky
---
Actually, they are not very tanky in their current meta usage. However focusing the cyno ability into them means that there is an emergent role where these ships are *just cynos* and with T2 modules only, it's possible to tank any of them to 100-130k ehp cynos.
---
I think at least the list should be expanded (HICs for example would be nice) but cynos themselves can have drawbacks; for example, lockbreak on activation, scan resolution drop, and massive sig bloom.
---
Too bad they both die in the end
---
In the short term demand will spike and price will rise, medium term suppliers will switch to building more of them and price will drop.
---
Lol shit data. Give a breakdown of all regions, factor in historical summer numbers and you might have a glimmer of an argument.
---
not anymore after september. I guess we lose again some players and the average login goes from now 18k down to 16k and we are @2005 stats again.
---
Check what the CSM was saying. They are reps for NS. You dont know the facts obviously but its public knowledge by now. 
---
For one, this is not true. There are a shitton of more exploration bots in NS than ever before. Just because you dont see them doesnt mean theyre not there. Secondly, HS, which always was a bot heaven, has seen massive influx since the blackout. Now sure, alot are players but I can promise you that the a large portion is bots. We dont have less bots in the game today, we have more. And also here, just because you dont see them it doesnt mean that theyre not there. Plenty of others are seeing these things.
---
Ofc its affecting you perfectly. Shortterm. Because long term you wont find targets. And if you ever wanna do more than just kill ratting carriers, which the guy you responded to does, youre kinda fked because that requires dreads.
---
People already know how its going to play out, perhaps not details but in broad strokes. And you will see yourself in a couple of months. But the thing is, these changes are so invasive that the players you lose from it will probably not be coming back after the the results can be seen. 
---
JFs wont be affected that much honestly, In fact this is kinda a boost. But moving caps around will get affected. Fighting offensively is much harder because one side will be hesitant to drop caps. It will be an uphill battle and its gonna get fkton more stagnant now.
---
LEUB you
---
so the CSM knew nothing about this incoming change eh?
---
Skill injectors fundamentally broke the game, and to this day I still think it’s the day the eve jumped the shark and started its downward spiral.
---
why are there lots of cynos on ships that are not recons i dont get it.
---
I think the most important part of this change is that you cannot fit cynos on other capitals now. So if you tackle and drop on a niddy. He cant just immediately cyno in a massive counter fleet. 
---
Instead he will need to warp in a fragile Recon ship to light the cyno which may get blapped before anything can jump.
---
Don't forget trying to cut off hands
---
i just see 4 blocks which will be unaffected and that the idea overall is stupid for the purpose of what its intended to do,
---
Goons, Test, Panfam (thanks to Horde), and maybe Winter Coalition wont be affected the rest will be dead like Russian space is ATM.
---
HTFU
---
Thinking of returning to eve. Last played back in 2017 ish. Could someone give me a tl:dr rundown of the major changes? Are incursions still a thing? Did they change exploration? I'm seeing nullbears cry about many things, but I always was a small gang/solo dude, would the new changes impact my playstyle? Thanks in advance for any answers
---
salt harvesting going just fine =)
---
This is some A grade, USDA Prime butthurt.
---
You can try one from here: [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Astero/Fittings](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Astero/Fittings)
---
:D
---
This has to be staged, you can´t be that dumb...
---
I like the changes. Delve can't fall. The little guys will get hurt again. Then people will keep bitching about the Supercapital umbrella of Delve again.  Nice try CCP.
---
fc what are drag bubbles
---
F
---
Don't say I didn't warned you.
---
You will see.
---
That's one of the biggest things about the cyno changes, though. The point of it is that alphas can't use cynos and so you can't just spin up a disposable cyno alt. You have to have a committed character or get someone you trust to light a cyno for you. And this is a good thing, it goes back to how cynos were before alpha clones were a thing and it forces players with capital ships to rely on allies to get the full benefit of their ships, which is how it should be. If we have a hull that alphas can fly that can use cynos we pretty much remove the point of that restriction, and at that point you might as well allow T1 battleships to fit cynos as well.
---
That, or they are wanting to sell them elsewhere.
---
You can't access jita market from outside the forge.
---
Goons, Horde and Test could actually bring a 250 Man Cyno Fleet and still have a Supercap Umbrella rdy and bring another 150 Man fleet depends on Timezone and People Commitment, on top of having still people Mining and Ratting. It all depends on the Timezone Numbers and willing of their Line Members but yes they won't be affected. All i see is more New Player Ship dying and all small Alliances which can't use their Sov properly anymore in Risk vs Reward.
---
So I might not be the most veteran player out there, but in reality turning off an income source wont help if there is no real sinks, as that would only make the the rich richer and the poor poorer..
---
The way I see it ISK can be taken back out of the game via a couple of ways
---
\- Training cost 
---
\- NPC Taxes
---
\- Stuff bought from NPCs corps being blown up
---
Training costs increase could be a thing, but would not really affect the already established playerbase with enough 0's in their bank account, but rather heavily impact new players, so maby not the best way to go.
---
NPC taxes increase could help mitigate some of the inflation, but with the amount of player owned stations for trading and crafting, increasing it too much will just lead to players mitigating over to PO structures with no isk going out of the game.
---
Increasing the amount of stuff bought from NPC corps that can be blown up however might be the ticket, though not sure what would have to be implemented for everyone to buy and cause isk sink that way.
---
And let the new meta begin.
---
&gt;Chaos longer time for support to reach people...
---
How does not being able to jump my dread until i skilled my alt for recons support me in any way?
---
He says it because he's salty about the game not being push-button-receive-ISK easy anymore. Ignore him.
---
nomad pls
---
Maybe get a mentor, even though it's good to ask these questions. If you have to you are probably not ready for the life sucking commitment it is to be a leader in eve Online. Not relying on one person is good, build a team, compliment each other's strengths.
---
For sure, there are a lot of dedicated people in the null blocs but they're vastly outnumbered by people who don't go on comms and just want to krab in a super. The latter group are more akin to renters than members.
---
That people could have found kills without the blackout.
---
Saying something is awesome and saying that very same thing needs serious balance doesnt really go hand in hand. Its subjectively more fun for you, I get that, I actually do like the blackout myself. But objectively its bad for the game just because the lack of balance. But CCP doesnt want balance, they dont want people to farm in NS anymore. You get that right? Every change is about hurting people wanting to live NS, making it unlivable. 
---
This is what we have been saying, content will be less, not more. Less people will live in NS or honestly even interact with it, its just not worth it. And the people who only wanted to live in NS and no where else are gonna quit the game.
---
Im not saying there werent issues with NS, there are issues all over the game. But, if you release unbalanced changes without trying to fix other things at the same time and convincing your playerbase that you are in fact gonna balance things at some point, people will just quit. 
---
This isnt whining, this isnt tears, this is reality. If the cost of your playstyle goes up by alot and there isnt a good alternative, for instance a HS and an LS that isnt shit, then..
---
New Players get fucked anyway by CCP, Hisec Trig Invasions hindering SOA Arc, the "suggested tutorial" people should play. Funfact how many returning new players you will hold when the first 7 days of the game are not "entertaining". And i guess the average MMO player of our time can't find this game entertaining when he gets blown up in 2h in his Tutorial without replacement lol by a Trig Invasion.
---
To be honest, your best bet is to train Gallente Frigate V and fly a Helios. It has the same hacking bonuses but it scans sites faster so it's also decently useful for PvP. Plus, having Frigate V is a great start for some good ships.
---
Yeah, but risk is bad so this change has literally destroyed EVE. Unsubbing.
---
so was i, i was trying to use comparisons.
---
HM's are LONG range, everything in eve that has long range has a reduced dps number. and infact at long range the HM's are capable or more than at least railguns, for sure more dps than artillery, so, theyre actually just fine. a little specialized. but thats kinda what missiles/rockets are.
---
rockets are not moaned about, up super close they do not beat A/C's or Blasters, but at their optimal range of usually about 7500m - 11km they are supreme :D
---
This already exists...
---
HK, Hawks and Novac might sell the secrets.  311 is a magic number.
---
It proves that CCP fixing broken mechanics, in usually clumsy and extreme ways, is not new.
---
don't they both die in terrible ways..
---
Depends on if he refines his ore since he needs specific ore reprocessing 5 to be efficient anyway.
---
Yeah. Sorry I wasn't clear.
---
I mean t2 command ships such as the claymore or nighthawk
---
It’s almost like removing local was a massive game changing decision that requires multiple months of collecting data before they can fix some of the obvious problems.
---
The only way they can do this is by ripping the bandage off and then seeing what happens.
---
Take your tin foil off your head if you think ccp wants to kill nullsec off which is the lifeblood of their game.
---
&gt;There's no one crabbing in capitals to light it on
---
Last the universe checked, that was a good thing.
---
Way back, in ye olde 2007, they were introduced as incredibly powerful SUPPORT vessels - you'd have a fleet engagement where carriers would be able to offer new ships and launch fighters, assigning them to members in the fleet.
---
Of course, this was taken to the extreme, where the support role consisted of spidertanking carriers  a la logistics and fighters became the sole source of damage. And people used them for beltratting from basically day 1.
---
Oh well.
---
&gt; your only change is whatever cyno's the stuff in.
---
This is exactly what im talking about though. The whole reason nano supers work is because you can get in and out before anyone has time to react and run away. More often then not if it takes more about 4-6 minutes to burn a ship a few jumps into a pocket and kill a target or it's not happening. What would have taken 1-2 minutes to get in system is now going to take 3-4 at which point i probably already missed the target if they have any eyes/intel at all.
---
Not letting cap use cynos makes 100% sense because they can just chain escalate without contest but limiting cynos to one of the slowest weakest ships in the game doesn't really make sense.
---
I'm sure someone can explain to me how stupid i am and i only want easy kills though.
---
Well if you look at the top personalities in Spectre and their historic and current affiliations... there's a lot of bad blood between them and particularly CVA.
---
They also push the narrative that NPSI is the exact opposite of NRDS which is technically correct (even if both end up fostering a similar outcome: a community you can be a part of without tying your flag to it).
---
I can't say I disagree. It made it harder for smaller groups to compete by innovating novel new strategies, since after injectors a large alliance could adapt to these strategies on a large scale in a matter of days. It made capitals insanely common, since not only could everyone fly them but everyone could also fly the ships needed to gather the resources and ISK to build them on a large scale. It transformed the nullsec recruiting meta from one of quality to one of quantity, where the time it took to train a newbro into a pilot that could fly (if not understand) a doctrine dropped from months to days.
---
And all CCP needs to do is to put a hard cap on injectors. Prevent injection past, say, 20Mn SP. That'll do the job.
---
you know that Test, Goons, Panfam or Hordefam, and Winter Coalition have 0 Problems with bringing the hulls? Who do you think produces 60-80% of the stuff you buy in jita? Right thats your big Powerblocks. They have the Money, they have the Manpower, the shit on the change and adapt with SRP for Force Recon ships on top of Standing Fleets who get more organized. So now you dont see the Cyno instantly lit by the Supercarrier with 50M EHP. They can even afford to have 2-5 Force Recon alt's rdy for every ratting/mining heavy area without being affected at alll. While your smallgang guys lose some pilots for the recon if they want to escalate. Escalation was already in the favour of the Defender now its even more so.
---
Google is your friend.
---
They can't take it out of the Hangarbay tho and boarding will be fast since a Ceptor can allways just warp at zero and usually nobody sticks at zero with the Super... usually.
---
Also Bombers might volley a Recon but it takes them ages to do so giving you like 10sec of an active Cyno and that should be plenty given the fact the Superpilot is most likely crying in voicecomms like a little bitch so everyone is alerted and ready to jump.
---
The Windows logoff.wav did it for me
---
I think one of the best part of the changes was that fcs can target cynicism quickly and prevent reinforcements. You can’t just stack it onto a fax and keep an open cyno and keep using it.
---
In no way shape or form so I want to see a cyno on a fucking damnation or a t1 battleship like the Nestor or abandon.
---
It defeats the fucking purpose, those ships can be so tanky and with such high resists that they would be very very very tough to kill.
---
Supply will catch up as people build to meet demand. T2 builders who see they can sell Arazus etc at 600% markup (or whatever it's at right now) will divert to them and build bulk quickly.
---
thats true :) nano gangs warpcore stabs, safety of wormhole's maybe we see the pattern that hilmar is a WHer.
---
Alphas cant light cynos anyway. My thoughts behind a t1 hull even if it is a faction one is to spare some of the mind numbing grind to get the ship skill 5 needed for t2 hulls. Giving a faster training but still expensive hull would serve as a stepping stone to other, better T2 hulls that can cyno
---
I think it's actually people like *you* pushing all non-spodbrains to groups with an umbrella with your playstyle.
---
Does seem the reeing from generic leet pvp'er that he coukdnt kill a rorq in his uberpeenfit loki because the "shitcarebearomgpawnbait" lit a cyno is the basis for this change, im now believing the sperg that ccp has decided a certain style of game play is paramount.
---
CCP did state they will revisit th change,
---
personally i think low tank low cost choice is needed for generaly travel to help the little guy, rookie ship? stands out, dies fast, -10 tank, and well. they gave us 'spawn rookie ship' now theres no reason to do it xD
---
HIC makes an ovious choice for a cyno-able hull, but, what about the marauder, or an interdictor? both expensive hulls for what tank they have. Why did the cheapest cyno choices, or any choice tbh have to be a cloaky one xD
---
Powerblocks are not affected, they have skillfarms, they produce the shit, they have the manpower :P the only thing whats new is that your wormhole nullified nanogang now gets a 500M Killmail instead of a 50m or 1m one right?
---
As a wormholer who go got a super dropped on a bomber and two cruisers I welcome these changes.
---
Legacy fits
---
&gt;Alphas cant light cynos anyway
---
Fair enough, I hadn't used them in a while so I'd forgotten this.
---
&gt;My thoughts behind a t1 hull even if it is a faction one is to spare some of the mind numbing grind to get the ship skill 5 needed for t2 hulls.
---
The problem is that this is the point of the changes. It means that you don't just spin up disposable cyno alts, that making a cyno alt now takes a lot of time, a lot of ISK for injectors, or some of both. It means that cynos are rarer and harder to set up, and also more risky and easier to counter. Giving people a T1 hull that can be made relatively inexpensive if it becomes a meta just means that that benefit of the changes is completely negated.
---
you could feel Grath’s raging hardon through discord
---
I did. What now?
---
this change will for sure shake things up, and we will lose more players cause they lose trust in ccp. I think there need to be changes but i think the changes we face are a bit stupid and onesighted. Goons, Panfam, Test and WC can adapt :P you ever flew through russian space? All non Big Block nullsec will be like this in 2-3 Month. Sov Holding won't matter anymore for small alliances since they can't utilize the space.
---
goon rorqs will all have cloaked chunks but only an idiot still bothers with them
---
everyone and everything else though is going to eat shit
---
let them rejoin then its not kick ascee its kick snuff! :P

@CCP\_Rise Did you guys mean to fix cloaky camping with blackout, (now no one sits scared to undock while being cloaky camped :) - its great for both sides

can we get our use for 'spawn my corvette' again and have rookie ships use cynos? still takes cyno lvl,5 has 0 tank, and sticks out as a warning of what its for?
---
[deleted]
---
Perhaps the nullification on T3s is why they didn't include them.
---
Nah besides me being nit picky, it was a good time.  I think in essence if I wanted to be an kill board warrior then let me be.  They collectively didn’t like anyone talking about it or bringing it up.  When I left tiny was super busy with school or new job and needed a break.  Good dudes none the less.   I’m just a bitter old vet lol.

From the Fweddit side: I've no idea what was going on. Ping screamed for dreads and I got in on the action. Blood for the blood god.
---
you now have a reason to scan structures, but its not that impressive,
---
new changes do nothing different for the small guy or the big guy.
---
if your thinking to return to eve, now is prime time, winters comming :D blackouts here, chaos is here, join the game while it still looks and plays the way you remember and change with it. all these changes are frekin awesome for PVP. and everyones been getting fat for too long.

For the last 2+ years CCP has been busy driving this game straight into the carebear dumpster. Skill Injectors, Rorquals, 800mil Upwell Structures with 3 timers, 3x30min damage cap, 10+ days of RF and Asset Safety, Cargo Deposit, Titan hulls for 40b, and so on. Losses became cheaper and borderline meaningless and losing your stuff in the first place became harder and harder aswell.
---
Any change towards the opposite direction is a welcome one.
---
never actually been bosoned. how long at a time is the gate "a bad place to be"? 
---
is it safer if one guy at a time breaks gate cloak and warps off? or lands on gate and goes through? so dont fleet warp to gate, warp to tactical and go through one at a time.
---
I don't believe you. Real pvp is dead and all that remains are cloaky ganks. Please stop what you are doing immediately or else BigBill is going to madpost.
---
God no not hunting. I was more thinking fleet cynos.
---
I'm happy to stick at zero to a super, its zero on his fighters I dont like ;)
---
and make the old garde ragequit :)

---
a Vexor if fit to normal 'meta' will be able to handle a T2 mission just fine, knowing who your fighting helps decide which damage type to resist against but this is not a must at this stage of your progression.
---
When fitting a medium ship, ensure your at least fitting medium sized modules, ie: 10mn AB, 50mn MWD, with shield, you often can fit 'large' onto a medium hull with shield repairers, or extenders.

My retriever was in hull by the time it entered warp. Naturally the one that got stuck on the rocks, didn't have time to get unstuck and warp out before it got melted.
---
It might be worth mentioning I got attacked by a group of 4.
---
Try secure station containers.
---
You mean, you might actually have to rely teamwork and play pro-actively with other members in your organization and use ships with specific roles? Sounds awful.
---
Imicus is a decent ship for a beginner, but astero position is superior despite it being more far expensive.
---
Lets look at Astero\`s bonuses:  
---
 **Gallente Frigate bonuses (per skill level):**  
---
20% bonus to Drone hitpoints.  (Imicus has none)  
---
**Amarr Frigate bonuses (per skill level):**  
---
4% bonus to all armor resistances (imicus has none)  
---
**Role Bonus:**  
---
100% reduction in Cloaking Devices CPU requirement   (astero\`s bread and butter for travelling and hiding)  
---
37.5% bonus to Core and Combat Scanner Probe strength (Imicus has 7.5% per level \* 5 (level of gallente frigate) = 37,5% - *same bonuses* but from the **start**)  
---
10+ bonus to Relic and Data Analyzer virus strength (compared to 5+ on imicus.)  
---
• Can fit Covert Ops Cloaking Device   (With this thing we can hang around undetected as long as we are *not retarded*)  
---
• Cloak reactivation delay reduced to 15 seconds   
---
Astero is in another league thanks to covops cloak, bonus to Relic/Data analyzers and has Scanner probe strength of imicus at level 1. However, it can also be fit to kill other explorers and some limited PvPing  (don\`t expect to kill battleships in this unless those are AFK) thanks to bonus to armor resistances and drone hitpoints so i would choose Astero if you want best of both worlds and can afford to lose one or two (tip #3: Never fly what you can\`t afford to lose).
---
Here is a fitting of scanner astero (that can\`t fight) that i used to scan almost every single system in drone regions and escape few gangs (for my style of play its strong sides were warp speed to get around quickly and single warp stab to survive occasional disruptor from careless intie):

You can downgrade/bling anything you like (Everyone has its own astero fit) and play around with whatever you need depending on situation.
---
Have you heard about book “Empires of EvE”? And have you heard about Corp #1234567 which existed somewhere in 2015 and left no traces beyond some killboard records?
---
Can you elaborate please? As a new player this isn’t something that’s great to hear.
---
This. When they're docking is a great opportunity as they have no transversal.
---
Hahaha, I was like wait... this clip isn't going to make sense, and then whamo, ya got me.
---
How about if you have covert, you can't have nullified
---
Pandemic Horde?, Eve University? are not afraid for a fight last time i see them Theres KarmaFleet but these guys suck, and dont play fair :) 
---
(one day youll understand me when i say fight against the Imps not for them)
---
'Panic Attack' is a new guy welcome great group who got tonnes of fights and fighting chance while i was with them, they live in low sec, the 3 above nullsec
---
I dont know pretty much anything about wormholes. but i gave my 2cents
---
Capital umbrellas are fine. The change doesnt mechanically make any issues. 
---
The only issue is CCP now being blatant with the pay to win lmao.
---
A T1 cruiser is a lot harder to maneuver into the correct system than a frigate (or especially a ceptor)
---
Some very intelligent people play eve..
---
Sure sounds like many smaller fights and blocking actions.
---
Sounds fun to me. I’d love to be part of a small elite block in action preventing a whole fleet from supporting a major engagement
---
No worries. Also when ur doing t1 abyssal sites (in a frigate) dont loot everything.
---
Just do the Biocache Can as it has basically all the loot of the sites.
---
Am I the only person that spotted the date in the URL?
---
A middle finger to ccp
---
I checked my numbers before talking. Tank-fit falcon with mwd is 100k ehp vs uniform (and less vs em/explo) without links and implants. Yes, that's alot, but still way less than a capital ship, or tank-fit abaddon/rokh, or even tank-fitted maller with 22m total ship+fit price.

---
I'll admit it's one game style I wanted to try but when i had the Alts/SP/ISK wise RL made me take break from Eve;    
---
That's in my mind the only bad side effect of this change but as workaround you surly have the skills/experience/alts to covert cyno bridge force recon and then light regular cyno ?  
---
It does sound like longer as not as effective but maybe it can be done ?
---
Give Cynos a mass limit like Wormholes.
---
you won't even need booshers at this point because the  counter won;t be able to get on field fast enough to keep you from melting through anything short of a rorq with just a pile of bombers that can appear with zero warning.
---
claw, lol.
---
What
---
What if... Part of the deal was for CCP to shake things up themselves... Instead of Pearl having a direct hand in things?
---
And my axe!
---
Stealth Bombers, and Exploration ships, and the Blockade Runners. Makes 0 sence they can use a Covert Cyno but a normal one is beyond the reckoning of EVE science. Things of that nature
---
I want to know what drugs were taken when someone decided, Recons and............... BLOPs...... FUCK YEAH WOOHOOO WE FUCKED NAILED THIS
---
Why people don't Blops expensive shit like that is beyond me.
---
thats strange, all the cearbears and those who just farm dont fight, are leaving or 'unsubbing'props for planning ahad, im lucky enough to already have my 3 main toons at cyno 5
---
mmm.. what happen? i see BR am confuse, my head spin..need more drugs
---
You are saying this with a straight face. Yet all of the changes they have announced for the upcoming 18 months is about making NS unlivable. The cyno change is one of them. 
---
And no, you never need to rip of a bandage, game development is all about iteration. You make small changes and then check the results. You dont make multiple changes within the same timeframe whilst having login events at the same time because you will never know what caused what. 
---
But thing is dude, its okey. Im not gonna try to convince you of anything. Time will tell. But remember who you are putting your faith in, the same people who refused to listen when they were told Rorqs would be OP and then never fixed them (3 years and running). If you really think they will balance things within a couple of months then ye. Idk.
---
i wonder if the ECM ships will get that bonus they spoke of before releasing ecm changes last time (which are great)
---
if i buy your company for sure i wont let you take the decisions. i will take the deicsions and you will implement it. CCP never changed the game drastically. PA its changing. And thats ok :) No lies no bs.
---
Not at all, I'm just good at baiting people into a rage ;)
---
Does "another game" work here?
---
No. He just framed his answer to the question like an idiot.
---
Turned out that when confronted about it his definition of golden ammo is weird.
---
they dumb, thats why
---
Hahaha this is the most fun timeline because of the endless salt from nullbears.
---
Wormholes have eaten shot for years, especially immediately after the carrier and hic changes.
---
Fw space has been broken for like a decade.
---
Welcome to eve! It’s nullsecs turn!
---
This is fun!!!!
---
The problem is they're wanting to remove cynos from caps, and you couldn't increase the fitting enough to stop that without having to have ships with role bonus to cyno fitting
---
Can't put a freighter through those, or even a medium sized cruiser fleet
---
That barely even feels like shit talking, between the name and the wording that actually feels almost like a classy gentleman
---
I disagree on this completely. The majority of eves player base likes pve activities. Likes saving up for big shiny toys.   
---
If ccp takes everything away so you can only take it out once in a blue moon and lose it when you maybe take a small vacation than people will stop playing, turn alpha or downsize their amount of accounts. And any one of those is bad for the game. Old veterans aren't going to come back in droves. They left on a high note if they would come back none of their fond memories of past alliances will be there. So ccp might get a 3 or 6 month sub out of it but I doubt it will be longer.  
---
 They should focus on their NPE make the game force them into doing things for their first month. So they get experience in the game and start to wonder why does this work like that and how can i improve it. ccp should give free fitted T1 ships and give them a questing system. Like the SOE Arc and keep them engaged. .  Heck I would even play those things . They got books and books of lore. DO SOMETHING with it.  
---
Turn you capsuleer into a slave freeing minmatar hero or amarrian justicator.   
---
You can even trow in small arenas for 1 on 1 pvp in free 1 ships and if they say hey I like this  give them a quest dangling in front of their eyes. We got this warzone and they need your help. Do you want to fight and trow them into faction warfare.  
---
But no forcing nullsec into nips and naps because this Chaos thing seems great is the way to go
---
Finally installed the game yesterday after having wanted to give it a try for years. No idea why I never pulled the trigger.
---
All I wanna know right now is how long I will take at whichever pace to “catch up” with everybody so that my presence in the game at least remotely mattered.. if that makes sense?
---
nothing of value was lost
---
id say a command burst
---
You heard it here folks, content has no value.
---
I see what you did there....
---
Crypto **MINING** isn't gambling.... I'm at you "Bruh"  (Been there, got the BTC's to prove it!)
---
Alright. In the end Im fairly certain you will cry because of lack of content but sure. Same people hailing these things will be the ones begging CCP to revert them.
---
 This is a copy paste from another post but the general points count here as well.

Catch up will you.
---
Brisc isnt on this CSM.
---
Oh you know, Svipoki, Jackgu etc.
---
the same drugs they take before every dumb fuck thing they come up with.
---
&gt;"ya but think of the little guy, small groups are dead now!"
---
They say that while simultaneously dropping supers on 5 frigates and cruisers every chance they get
---
Why not bump up the fitting requirements for a cyno field generator so that fitting it on most ships will gimp the fit then just give certain ships a bonus "reduction" in fitting cost to make it practical to use on those ships.  Restrict it off of caps if you're worried about cyno fauxes etc and Robert is your mother's brother.
---
they promise to revise a lot of things, they follow through on almost none of those promises.
---
It will never get blapped before anything can jump unless the group are massive pepegas. Like massive massive pepegas. If they're worried about their recon dying for a bridge cyno then all they need is a single blops to make it through which can then hard cyno.
---
and here we see the man completely blowing out his own argument by admitting that he clearly doesn't know anything. Such a shame.
---
And with all the free SP thrown around by CCP my scout alt already have this trained.
---
This desperately needs a tl;dr.
---
&gt;without getting your 300m cyno insta dunked
---
If you can afford a titan I think they'll be fine
---
I both like and hate the changes, I'm so conflicted. But at least now I can go back down to 2 subbed accounts instead of 7 and sell all my caps. And extract my cap alts. Fund some fun times.
---
And then the saber lands on grid and your like shit!
---
What is her ign? Would like to invite her to my wormhole.
---
&gt; ever considered that using capitals should be a rare occassion in warfare?
---
why? 
---
In what world would you hold back your heavy assets ... just to make it fairer for people who haven't put in the same amount of effort? get the fuck out of here.
---
Thanks for the answer, will probably download it later today!
---
ohh look, I DID check what the CSM was saying. And they also admit that they totally underestimated the Rorq change. Their predictions when it comes to cyno jammers etc were spot on, but with the rorqs they were plain wrong..
---
How many times did Snuff and other groups actually make successful dreadbombs in delve? 3 times? more, less? in a very target rich environment like delve?! Status quo is shit... I think we can agree to that. so, why not try new ideas, like this one, and watch it play out.
---
anyways, I stop responding now. 
---
we have two different opinions on how it's gonna play out. Well actually not even, I just see the POSSIBILITY that it could actually play out differently than you say. And I just want to see the change end look how it ACTUALLY plays out.
---
Best case scenario: The umbrellas actually do get alot more difficult to manage.
---
Worst case scenario: Umbrellas stay exactly as powerful. Hostile escalations become extremely hard, and the game becomes even more stagnant. And CCP is just rolling back the change after 3 month... So after 3 months we are back where we are currently.
---
CCP is now testing things. And with some stuff they were spot on, and some things was bad. And at the current stage of "rapid engineering", they roll the bad ones back pretty fast (see the drifters).
---
So lets just give them the chance of a try. And judge them afterwards? Cause, as we agree, current Eve is stagnant.
---
It feels wh’s spawn more often lately. Got 5 NS connections yesterday spawned in my C5. More people experiencing this?
---
no need to group up, cyno beacons are still a thing, and you will still be able to light a cyno on a gunned citadel to bring in your cap fleet.
---
new players tend to do more smaller groups, old players more towards endgame. But this is absolutely not targetted towards new/old but to small/large.
---
nice misdirect. This is as stated, targetted at the large umbrella.
---
Then go and create it
---
Yeah, I get that, and taking cynos off ratting and mining ships helps with that.
---
A Fax isn't a ratting or mining ship. Giving it a cyno doesn't hurt anything, but leaves a hard cyno ship for fleet fights.
---
So, wasnt that easy to find.
---
Very informative.
---
Agreed, I never actually believed that CCP had the balls to make such drastic changes. Can't express how glad I am to have been proven wrong.
---
Keep the chaos coming!
---
Heh, look at those blue down arrows, seems the community is telling you your opinion is not shared.
---
Hopefully this change makes all you rude, whiney anti-content players leave. In fact I will just say: please unsub and leave the game, please!!
---
Its all about risk reward, significantly heighten risk must come with significant rewards. Right now for isking there are almost as profitable without the risks given to null sec farming.
---
I don't see the return coming very quickly.
---
rip. XP
---
Nothing
---
the real question, does the panic module that bubbles mining/industry ships, also bubble the cloaky hauler, that will be able to light a cyno to get the blops in to then also light a cyno for the Cavalry?
---
Stfu and quit the game.  All your posts are trash tier with zero knowledge of the game.
---
Well, he got his throat slit in the end, so there is that...  
---
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Lol I moved my titan a few weeks ago, but I was going to delay it a few months
---
With mass supercapitals on field arent 300m cynos the least of your worries? Also it will be easy enough to get people in because the fight is gonna have tidi, but not the jump from system?
---
If im reading the data correctly, yes activity dropped but more importantly, ratting dropped significantly more. That to me is a win. 15k npc's killed vs. 120k killed in the same time. So what I see is that ratting dropped by 90% and pvp by only 30%. Or am i wrong? If thats the case than mission accomplished, well done CCP.
---
And it won't have the ehp of a rorqual or a supercarrier... Don't pretend it doesn't matter
---
I don't remember the exact fitting or the speed, but it was done in a Crow. So I think it still took me around an hour or so.
---
Exactly that!
---
Agreed, but I think this change should also introduce some small buffs to Recons and BLOPS; maybe some more raw HP to the first and better resists profile for the second... and well, BLOPS always deserved a CovOps cloak, so this might very well be a good time to give them that aswell.
---
he does it all wrong... he doesnt tell CCP how many accounts he is unsubbing... only that will hurt CCP...
---
Isnt that just a BPC? Thought BPO was darker.
---
So something like making it have no fitting cost but takes away all your powergrid and cpu?
---
At that point you are breaking the game rules, which cloaky camping obviously does not right now.     
---
Will everybody care? Of course not. But I'm sure some would.        
---
And CCP could, in theory, go after those people for breaking their rules.
---
I don't think it will ever happen, though.
---
petty
---
That fitting requirement would have to be something like -50% to CPU output.
---
I think some people are missing the evident sarcasm in your comment.
---
&gt; The 42 systems are all the same number of jumps. You don't need any extras.
---
Fuel usage is tied to Light years jumped not number of jumps.
---
Sure thing, (very) short version:
---
Free afk ISK leads to more people getting free afk ISK and that's perpetual. There's one type of player that has all the ISK and prices are overwhelmingly high.
---
Too much ISK = inflation of prices.
---
Counter question:
---
What WH activity is an ISK faucet? No such thing as bounties on drifters... or am I wrong?
---
You can't put force recons inside a rorq, though.
---
What does it means it have been flagged by community,?
---
At least you can pop the cyno ship, get a killmail and run two systems over to do it again.
---
no thats a bpo
---
that is the darker you speak of bpc's are much much lighter
---
KARMA WHORING BTW
---
Or just a huge penalty. Like 50% or something.
---
I doubt it would work.... 
---
Let's be hones big bad gwens are the "issue" but gsf bastn and  The initiative would whoop out a cap/ super cap fleet they would kill trigs with ease 
---
if they couldn't kill them I don't think anyone could
---
I would recommend against flying an Astero until you've:
---
1.  Had a few cheaper ships blown up and learned how not to die
---
2.  Are able to use a COVOPs cloak.
---
Yes. It's such good entertainment for kids. [Kids Anime](https://media2.giphy.com/media/K6Aoqa3QOZo0E/source.gif) is just wholesome fun for the young ones.
---
Already Replaced.
---
yeah wouldn't want people to have fun in this game.
---
we often take an arty mach in 6-7 man gang, no need of big numbers for it just 2 antitackle ships is plenty, just a dumb fit with nice alfa that makes fighting those hacs and snipe t3d a lot more fun
---
You're right it takes a couple seconds for the grid to load.
---
Sure. Please deliver via nullsec by Claw.
---
when the cost of the cyno is 50% the cost of the capital hull you are moving things become a little retarded.
---
This is the first time I've ever heard of this, so if you have already played enough with your graphics settings (I'd recomment setting those to "Fixed Window" and the resolution to one that matches that of your monitor) and found no solution, I'd recommend sending a ticket to CCP detailing your issue.
---
Add screenshots of how the client looks on your PC and one of your graphic settings so they have a clear picture of the problem.
---
Ah.  I've only ever carrier ratted so v0v.
---
It is though
---
Yes, usually a pair of Sins can do every DED. It also avoids gatecamps and cuts down travel time by a lot.
---
It is not that common anymore though. Partially because you get a lot more DEDs from escalations now and the loot being not nearly as worthwhile as it used to.
---
As for the gatecamps and/or smartbombs - it is worth to also check this site:  [http://eve-gatecheck.space](http://eve-gatecheck.space/) 
---
It won't replace a scout (however this Kestrel is dirty-cheap, so who cares about it?), yet it will auto-check zKb for you
---
I'd go with a heavy neut on super as you'll most likely always have 4 FSU, 1 NSA. And 1 nuet to take care of small shit in cars they try things.
---
We have always been at war with Eurasi- I mean Sort Dragon
---
What's the aproximate payout of those escalations?
---
no no no you don't get it, its not fair if people can defend themselves /s
---
boo hoo
---
That's why you light a couple of them together lel. Whatever you do if CCP is lazy and doesn't introduce new mechanics, the guys who can afford to spam caps will also be able to afford to spam cynos.
---
You lucky motherfucker... well done o7
---
Solid advice, but with recently implemented zkill delay, it's better to look at zkill of each of the systems to see if camping is being done there at all. Campers rarely change their fav spots.
---
You're the nerd that kills solo roaming Myrms in lowsec with a Nyx. ZULUL
---
&gt; If you are in space you should. It was safe. Be alert. Constantly. Be aligned. 
---
FTFY
---
they are moons outside of delve.
---
Cheers, I'll look into it and maybe send them a help ticket.
---
I hope this is true because my legion is sorely needing a new skin.
---
wasnt me, im just being a filthy karmawhore :P
---
Oh damn, just, damn lol
---
People are too use to the I win button. They want that cyno to instantly reinforce the grid so eve stays ez. Ez=safety
---
You had our interest, but now youre just flaunting.

3/10's drop little guaranteed loot, but can drop pirate faction frig bpc and/or pirate faction frigate sized a-type modules, up to 4 different., as well as some faction modules. (I've had 4 deadspace modules drop only once but it's possible)
---
For the cost, look up corpii, gistii, centii, pithi, coreli a-type module prices.
---
Ok, I'll edit accordingly. Was that your corpmate or are you just zkill whoring?
---
PLease please please allow cynos to be lit in WHs, and to be able to jump in from known space, will finally give some feature parity to nullsec and WH
---
Zkill karmawhoring
---
Umm yes, you get a shiny recon or blops kill.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Stupidity.
---
Well no I mean randomly select a class of ships to do it to making only plexable for a few weeks or months. Don't remove the BPOs from game, but just disable them so the market dries up.
---
I'm thinking it would actually sort of force people out of certain classes and try others for a bit since they don't do it willingly it's all based on the current meta
---
Collect blue loot and sell it for set price.
---
yeah and only a 30ish day train from cyno 4 to 5 .... not to mention frigate 5 cov ops. but yeah fuck those guys who do all the thankless work that allows everyone else to play the game the way they want. /s
---
But does the martini know who maderall is?
---
Not an ISK faucet.
---
Faucet means it appears from nothing and ienters the system. Like NPC bounties or mission rewards.
---
Did you just assume my unspent skill points?
---
less people in non block power nullsec is good for the game man! Less people who fiddle with the moongoo market and production cycles! Less people in nullsec means more people in wormholes/hisec and maybe 10 dudes more in 30 lowsec systems (yes 10 dudes more for 30 lowsec system so 0.3 dude per system more!). It will be the definition of a healthy game where new players dont know what to do, how to catch up and of course the sister of eve arc is camped by trig invasion forces. New player experience is so enjoyable that not even 0.3% of them stay in the game so we need to get rid of the players who are in game or tweak numbers with forcing them for more alt accounts. But damn that will backfire again, and again. But hey reddit will be happy about half biased changes which dont change the problems or innovate new mechanics which shake up the game and improve maybe the new player experience which are used to wow, gw2 etc. new player experience in mmos. And since we don't see many big fights vs nullsec powers since they can't trust ccp in the changes and the first move to adapt is the stalemate we have atm no big media coverage of 10 Trillion isk losses on both sides ergo no new player hype.
---
RIP Phoebe Freeport Republic
---
Adapt or die right
---
Small amount of context : https://i.imgur.com/VHyGcSa.png
---
Okay so:
---
* Restricting stuff in 'sandbox' is never good
---
* Cynoships will now be much more expensive, which itself is like "oh okay", but it leads to a problem: gives advantage to big blobs, who can just spam the fuck out of them because they are wealthy as fuck
---
* It support passive behaviour.
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
Can I literally do that?  You're such a shit poster you give the internet cancer.
---
Uuuuuuugh
---
....that factor isn't affect by anything that was proposed....
---
Should've just removed it from caps and supers.
---
Keep in mind, you have to design this system and then explain it to new players.
---
This front line system could be summarised as.
---
- you can only capture/ contest a system that are adjacent to a system of your factions control . (hisec inclusive)
---
- systems held for longer periods of time deliver a multiplier to all LP payouts within them / beneficial system effects (for example the sales tax and industry job related bonuses) this is to enhance risk VS reward and incentivise all activity within system. *keep in mind, sales tax was recently increased... Therefore, the tax related bonus is now of greater value. 
---
- rather than ihubs, replace the final system flip with a faction FOB. 
---
(exactly like the npc pirate ones except player controlled while vulnerable.)
---
Thats it... 
---
It really stands less and less chance of implementation for every sentence it takes to explain it.
---
read patchnotes
---
If you are about to dunk some supers you don't care about 300mil.
---
Noone cares, just unsub in silence and move on.
---
OMG!!! : for ccp and this guy
---
Really!
---
Its affect because only recon and blops can fit it. So align, blap it, warp out, find another target. Repeat. A pvp group shouldn’t rely solely on cynos. Either roam and get your kill or use WH.
---
It's okay. I've been wanted to kill myself for years. Maybe I'll have the energy to stop wasting everybody's oxygen.
---
It counts as a faucet. The blue loot is sold at a set price. The only additional step is selling the loot. The LP store counts as a faucet and sink for this reason.
---

&gt; Missions &amp; NPCs:  
---
&gt;\- Triglavian Recon vessels have been sighted outside of Invasion zones.
---
Read the patchnotes. And stop playing afk, that's not actually "playing" and you deserve to be punished if you risk doing that.
---
I think OP meant the arty Macha are on the defender's side, not the attackers side.
---
show me on the doll where ccp touched you
---
With these changes we are better off leaving null and moving into WH Space TBH.
---
‘Uncontested' is the word you were looking for.
---
;)
---
I see what you did there.
---
Beggar!
---
Both my main and paid alt have cyno 5 already.
---
If you tackle a rorq disengage and then tackle anotherone two systems over you can have the rorq because that guy deserves to die.
---
YES. Also remove all Brackets. People should have to find their enemies in space.
---
I'm guessing that even without an overview you'd still die like the whinning little fuck you seem to be.
---
Sub two second align time, legit how did catch
---
A big drop in pvp activity. Working as intended?
---
Yeah dude, its not like a cov ops cruiser can easily circumvent those.
---
Almost like a recon can warp cloaked into position or something before the gank starts....
---
Dumbass
---
&gt; 80% of the player base.
---
Better eve dies rather than becoming a modern "safe" playground where everything is foam wrapped.
---
Wow
---
Yeah that happens already, and has nothing to do with the cyno changes.
---
A game shouldn’t make you feel like that, try something new. Lots of something’s out there.
---
&lt;3
---
In game only I hope. Otherwise do seek help.
---
funny that you are avoiding his point so hard …
---
&gt;you can´t be that dumb...
---
You clearly haven’t talked to users before.
---
This is someone who does not understand the nature of fire.
---
He tries to put out the fire and then leaves the card board box there, as fuel for the fire.
---
This just seriously fucked me. I don’t have alts to light a damn cyno. This sucks imo. The blackout relegated is to only using Caps to Rat and now we can’t even do that. Idk bros but this is the straw that broke the camel’s back to me.
---
No, really, tell me who was on what side and what happened.
---
Bonus capture status for adjacent systems is a bad idea. It should actually be vice versa. Generally speaking it should be harder for the leading side to defend systems. Therefore it is a lower tier side should be the one who gets bonus capture %, and high tier one gets bonus lp.
---
&gt;As someone who like the exploration and vast feeling of space in this game, I hate this idea.
---
Ditto.
---
How would you reccomend doing that on a ship with paper thin tank that shows up on everyone's overview in the entire system when cyno is popped?
---
Why people downvoting you? It's literally the only reason someone would FLY to jita for injectors
---
No. CCP should instead remove all graphics from the game and replace it by black, leaving only the UI to navigate. You should not be able to use your eyes to make sense of situation, but you should use the power of deduction, calculus and imagination !
---
True blackout. I'd be like a night mode Excel !
---
can i get your toon?
---
well. supers and rorquals are at at MUCH higher risk of death for ALL. and the blocs who are used to safety will im sure take heavy loss before common procedure steps in to the less organised alliances (or less skilled).
---
Blackout is and can be great for dreadbombs, you theoreticly can move dread bombs through enemy nullsec space, fit with cloaks between timers, then one jump out refit, and jump to target. 
---
you say it will effect subcaps, how and in what exact way do you mean this, for the good, bad, because etc?
---
i see subcap fleets being alot more scary to krabbers as they can alpha anything that can light a cyno off grid with enough of them, or at least geta pricey cyno ship kill :D
---
Fly by sound and smell only, I like it.
---
Why would anyone who lives outside of wspace want this? Aka basically the entire game
---
so as per zkill a guy put his titan bpo in a claw and died yet you're saying it could not be true? :big_thonk:
---
Sorry, I (understandably I believe) mistook you with a NS krab doing a sad attempt of an ironical complain about CCP implementing changes that, even though are targeted to solve some serious issues with the game that in my opinion are the cause of the current stagnation and general bad place the game is, affect their perfectly comfortable and safe massive isk making activities that (considered in total) have drove the economy to the ground.
---
If that was not the case I apologize, my exageratedly agressive response was not directed at you personally but to those kind of entitled players.
---
And don't worry, I also suck at this game and share your opinion on explosions.
---
o7
---
people like to pose it as it being a more dangerous for PVE great for elite PVP change but there's plenty of us who have concerns with the fairly obvious attempt to make the game a little more P2W what with now having to make sure you have extra omega alts and inject the skills to fly at the least 300 million isk ship  that needs to be logged in whenever your pve alt is on, not to mention the fax alt you'd also need omega'd and injected into.  
---
It poses problems for both defending your krabs and for offensive warfare, when realistically they could have taken cynos off of things like frigs especially interceptors and super caps and it would have been an improvement.
---
Hitler had this same saying.
---
I'm down for this
---
That's not necessarily true. We definitely use them less, I'll give you that. But you have to ask yourself this, who can more easily afford a bunch of blops and recons for cynos, small groups or null blocs who have been previously rorq mining and ratting with impunity?
---
I've always been an opponent to these.  I went into a small debate with ccp fozzie at eve north about this.  The bottom line is that they do not want toon selling to come back and that this makes ccp a lot of money and there is no reason to change that in their eyes.
---
I tried to convey a middle ground that only up to x4 skills(or anything capital related) be trained with skill injectors but he shut that down with the previous reasoning that toon selling would just come back.
---
lmao why would they nerf a GOOD source of income from whales
---
better keep nerfing playstyles totally unrelated to the root problems to make it seem like they care
---
I have no clue what that means. Is it sold to an NPC for ISK? What does LP have to do with it?
---
But no need to go into details, I'm not interested in WH PVE.
---
However... as it looks right now, CCP will nerf every faucet or passive ISK earning strategies, so enjoy as long as it lasts.
---
Knowing Simple Farmers that could be their own guy who died, they do funky shit to try to get reactions out of people
---
they are not facts, you racist
---
An oldie but a Goldie.
---
&gt; It proves that CCP fixing broken mechanics,
---
he says, unironically with a 'Cloaked' flair...
---
Hahaha, come on, we love him though.
---
Have you got a point?
---
Can I have your jump freighter.
---
I hope they do. It's too easy. They've hit null where I live and I expect the same across the board.
---
Goons and Legacy are a direct result of years and years of Panfam iron fisting anyone who was starting to get established in null. reap what you sow and all that shit.
---
Contract stuff to “nubnub russells” 
---
plzkthnxbye
---
Meh I moved to High-sec, doesnt affect me lol
---
I'm actually conflicted about the cyno change, as a roamer i love it, as someone who has a load of caps its gonna be a pain in the ass, but it's a step in the right direction, they should perhaps have taken a different direction, adding a t2 cyno module that could only be fitted to certain ships, a few more than the current proposed but not many. Making it so you can only jump to T1 in industrial or when tethered for combat caps, perhaps that's not far enough of a balance.. this is just off the top of my head.
---
Being AFK is an actual way to play the game. It's just more risky. The benefits of it are you can gain Isk without having to spend as much time monitoring everything IRL.
---
You give me way too much credit... I googled jita 4-4 Eve and then just overlayed the unachoring symbol and typed the rest in.
---
This image was the product of idle chatter on Comms how the chaos era will progress
---
You are salty, but you have a valid point and a rational reason to be upset.  Trust me, if the shoe were on the other foot with these changes you would be pure sugar compared to the salt people would vomit out here.
---
Cyno mechanics are one of the main reasons I stopped playing Eve. If there's any sort of change that stops every engagement ending in someone cynoing in BLOPs or caps, then I might just subscribe again.
---
Cynos are the worst thing to happen to Eve since boot.exe.
---
TIL They removed interdiction nullification from some ceptors.
---
I did debate if I should have shopped in the fortizar symbol but decided it was effort and that stations could count as keepstars
---
Wait I thought that Eve was dying when the Rorq came out?
---
Or when Drifters started to attack stations?
---
Or ... wait a second, hasn't Eve been dying for over 10 years now?
---
Shit... Busted by my own lazyness
---
One of the better “ok chaos lul” posts i’ve seen, the first i’ve upvoted. 
---
Well done
---
Can you send an itemized list of your assets to OhRevere.
---
So you want the guy to add a couple extra clients and more steps with higher investment to accomplish the same thing with a slower hunter and don't see how this kills content. Got it.
---
is there something wrong with character selling?
---
Out of all things you could have chosen to do you chose this post
---
And i’m confused, “fuck you” is an argument that has never changed any minds ever so... why?
---
It's funny how long after changes, some people still haven't heard of them.
---
Hm, did any1 tell Doom about Rorq changes?
---
&gt; No longer can any random maller fit a cyno to drop 10 titans on your 5 man gang.
---
This really is a good change. I think they should severely reduce the cyno cycle, though. It'll be too expensive for guys who own a cap but aren't rich.
---
Maybe even allow them to be loaded to a T-1 ship but give then a two minute spool up time. Then assign a bonus to recons that reduces the spool to 0 seconds
---
It is bad that’s why cloaks t3s and nullification exists
---
promises? they havent 'promised' anything, they have said they will review it, which id be shocked if they dont at all. just because they felt, or feel it was fine and nothing extra needed changing is fine. CCP like to through changes into eve and judge the effect from live server gameplay, i mean its kind of the best source, and its fun for meta changes and to keep the game live.
---
im a little biased as i think all goons are hisec cearbears in rorquals and injected into supers, but my actual IRL friends in goons are all crying too, its so frekin awsome. fucking pvp or leave, theres the door, the game is how many years old? its suppose to be rough and difficult, not space farming simulator, so much salt infact that im pretty sure alot of goons RMT. but thats my presumption.
---
and when an honest goon answers below, excessively unhappy in what i just said, im sure there are honest players in goons. through probability alone.
---
There's no fundamental way to prevent people cooperating, whether it's via in-game mechanics or out-of-game methods. So the best you can do is disrupt the ability of large groups of cooperating players to take advantage of game mechanics in an undesirable way, which is what this change is intended to do.
---
Because I need encouragement to hate myself even more.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I can already see next remove asset safety
---
Goddamn I hope they do.
---
&gt; supresses PvP heavily
---
you mean 'is pvp' just not the kind you like.
---
Could be worse. At least it’s not a cyno saber anymore
---
You must be dumb if you think someone would kill their own titan bpo.
---
Cynos predate boot fuck up though...
---
Actually I think heavy tacklers should be the first to lose the ability to cyno.
---
Would be kinda interesting if only battleships could fit cyno.
---
Then nobody can actually do PvE? Cause they'll be too busy sat in fleet cloaked waiting for something to happen.
---
yeah 4 properly fit frigates will kill any barge besides proc/skiff in a few seconds i dont see the problem tbh
---
&gt; So doing drastic changes and having the players who live in null move to high sec or quit
---
There are a lot of people in null who never should have left empire, IMO. There'vr always been guys who rage when they die but I've never seen people firesale so much over a game chanhe that's a month away.
---
Since when did wormholes hate cyno changes?
---
My adaptation was logging off, unsubscribing and uninstalling 5 years ago
---
Making harder to fit, or alternatively, give a big penalty to tank and/or speed/mass.
---
&gt; In Providence, the "pvp players who want easy shiny killmails" are the guys dropping caps on everything that moves, and the rest of us are largely using subcaps.
---
Wait, just yesterday I read that they never undock. Can't you guys settle on a narrative?
---
means that enough salty bittervets pushed a button
---
Why do uninspired, shitty memes like this get upvoted?
---
My corp usually uses JFs to bring our ships to LS (because we all have some seriously shitty sec status), so that's gonna be a fucking pain in the ass and we'll probably start doing a lot of DST runs instead when the patch hits TQ.
---
But overall I think this is a great and unexpected change for the health of the game (might need some small tweaks); expecting that only others suffer the consequences of the much needed shakeup being implemented by CCP would be both stupid and impossible, so we just take it and adapt to survive. 
---
I hope they keep doing this kind of shit, even if it becomes an inconvenience for me or my alliance, this will benefit those able to adapt and punish those unable to... like it always should have.
---
Claw is no longer bubble immune.
---
No BS tank comes remotely close to caps. Imo it'd be a compromise and won't prevent as much desirable cap on cap violence.
---
out of grid !!
---
Zkills 2hr delay was removed, shouldn't have any delay nowadays
---
Subtle, I like it
---
What you get scammed they have to deal with the fallout and follow-up.
---
Injectors are a hands off, money printing machine that requires no input from their staff.
---
but, you get a like 15minute blue timer on your first jump...... once thats gone, your starting fresh
---
Actually this happened 26,500 years ago
---
I had missed that info, thanks
---
Thanks broski
---
Sure there is, by making it so that adding manpower to projects makes it less efficient.
---
At least you didn't forget to online a vital module on your ship or something...
---
Have fun in hello kitty online.
---
You must not know Simple Farmers very well
---
Thank fuck this was a shitpost you had me worried there..
---
15-200 mil
---
I put together a falcon pure tank fit out of interest. Before boosts it has 100k EHP against EMP before links. Rorquals willl probably fit even more even shield links and remote shield boosters. Have fun to try to pop our cynos.
---
The issue with the cyno Nerf is it goes a tad to far. Insted of killing thowaway cynos they're just killing cynos.
---
Everyone is going to move to a super tanked raiper cuz afaik they have the best tank of all recons with the way shield recharge scales.
---
I approve of nerfing cynos.. I don't approve of making cyno 5 the only time it comes in handy. If they are going to make this change we need something for basic cynos.
---
Because with this change all the cyno ships will be the ones they listed.. what's the point in using a basic cyno on a recon... 
---
this is a tad heavy handed. Should be a spool up time and fitting requiredments not a complete gutting of the module.
---
Altho I approve of no caps using it that's nice no super cap cynos anymore.
---
And blops need a complete rework for this to really take hold.
---
I feel roaming gangs will adapt and the front line guys will get fucked cuz they can't cyno in help anymore
---
I actually am proud of ccp for trying to flip the sandbox. Make some big change.. my issue is it's to much like wh space now.
---
&gt; The majority of eves player base likes pve activities
---
 I only PvE just long enough to buy ships for PvP. To claim most *enjoy* the boring PvE systems shows you have huffed too much spod.
---
“u realy r beyond words u have basicaly spat...” 
---
I for one fully support any change to this game that weeds out dumb shits that type like this. Not to be a grammar Nazi, but for the love of fuck.
---
Cyno II
---
All I know is you don't know shit lmao
---
One gets burned alive and the other gets his throat slit.
---
So... could be worse?
---
&gt; Getting bored and leaving
---
&gt; Changing their view of the community's goals and the community dispersing
---
&gt; Deciding to destroy something from internal mechanics (BoB)
---
4. Discovering they're a paper tiger and flat out collapsing at the first pressure: Original Northern Coalition.
---
No that's the good kind of risk averse.
---
We only complain about the bad kind.
---
Please, consider the context. I didn't spoke of a small gang but specifically about fighting a rorqual. Your 6-7 men gang on its own is no immediate thread to a rorqual. Maybe after an hour the cap boosters run out. Or fuel for indy core.
---
I’m curious as to how fitting that alliance name is after this one...
---
no shit sherlock.
---
 a ship made for being clocked is weaker than a  ship made for tanking.
---
I'm soooo surprised.
---
Grr goons doesn’t invalidate what he said lol
---
That reduces their efficiency for in-game returns, not prevents them from cooperating. Which is what I was talking about. This change literally makes it harder for large groups to take advantage of Magic Teleportation^TM.
---
boot.ini actually :)
---
Remember how butthurt wormholers got when ccp changed hictors? They threw a fit.
---
thats true, however him saying they promised things they did not promise, does.
---
Most cap pilots can sit in subcaps as well... If you left the game for an extended period of time, you have some catching up to do. I don't see the problem here tbh.       
---
It's a different beast than suddenly removing asset safety, there are arguments to be made.
---
covert cyno doesn't show up on neither dscan or overview.
---
Ok then, Castor update?
---
the meme is done wrong
---
The umbrella is more powerful than ever with these changes
---
????
---
yeah, this.
---
remove the cynoception of caps having cynos to bring more caps.
---
...what?
---
So the only situation you're talking about is baiting solo recon cynos?
---
Im pretty sure most cap pilots are in reality dedicated capital alts. So, no.
---
no.
---
Home defense means HOME defense not NEIGHBOURGH defense.
---
Collateral damage
---
Skill injectors were a mistake from day one, but unfortunately we will be stuck with them until EVE dies at this point, unless we a drastic change in player behaviour.
---
Let them shake up cook mechanics
---
or wormholes
---
Unless “things” only means null.
---
And l”null” only means pve in null 
---
And “pve in null” only means pve getting ganked
---
Corrected :-)
---
Agreed, this is the fundamental flaw. Caps and supers should have never been more strategically mobile than subcaps, it makes no sense at all.
---
k
---
if you have 6-10 accounts you should have no problems bringing a recon alt
---
Bro that shit was years ago
---
Group together with other miners with a safety cyno on grid.
---
Have other pilots In system able to respond to attacks.
---
Basically what you wanted was to be all alone, never work with any other players, but then immediately be able to summon all the titan in the Galaxy to defend you if you got attacked?
---
Yes join a shit corp that does everything and train yourself to become a victim.
---
EVE doesn't have sound, but it's going to be easy to find the Goons by smell
---
Not being able to move is a pretty big reduction in combat capability...
---
restricting BS is always good.
---
because you have a 30day skill train plus the T2 hulls on your cyno alts .. thats at least 2 months of training time to pay for per cyno alt.
---
&gt; what's the point in using a basic cyno on a recon...
---
Shorter training time
---
Oh this is going to be fun to watch.
---
So no reason at all seems legit.
---
Better change would had been that you have to wait for cyno timer to run and *then* you can jump to it, say a 3min timer and unlike before you could  still move and use low / mid slot modules but not warp or cloak or target.
---
Once timer runs out it activates the cyno with old restrictions.
---
Please do. More for us to shoot at!
---
Try and get a Pilgrim to 100k ehp.
---
October 2018. So no yet years. I wasn't playing at the time and I guess this guy might not have been either.
---
invulnerability is definitly something that shouldnt be in the game really
---
thats how you should do game development .... push your player base for the best part of 15 years in a certain direction, then suddenly change your mind.
---
If I buy your company, you are either; 
---
1. Ruining it, losing all value, and I'm buying it at a bargain, 
---
2. Running it well, I'm paying a good market price for it (and your expertise) and logically wouldn't want to ruin a good thing. 
---
I'm not an idiot, so I'm not going to pay lots for something you're ruining. 
---
Is PA an idiot, and paid $400m for a lemon, or is CCP's expertise something to keep?
---
I 'member
---
ROFL.
---
Capitals won't be isk printing machines with an instant "save" button, but won't stop being used and critical to any alliance.
---
Besides that, if you really like and need that JF, just stop training your other characters for a little while and get your cyno toons the missing Cyno level and into a CovOps (if you don't want to use injectors). On the bright side, your services as logistics will be FAR more valuable to others and you should sell them accordingly.
---
In the meantime, just don't move stuff around or use a DST.
---
"Adapt or die" sound like an insult sometimes here, but it's actually the nature of this game we both love; the ones that manage to adapt to drastic changes will thrive, and those that do it first will profit.
---
Disclaimer: I'm usually an asshole and mock people bitching about their safe gameplay being fucked with (just look at my comments), but you made a good argument for your situation in a non-whiney way so props for that. 
---
Hope you manage to adapt and thrive in this everchanging universe o7
---
How does this cripple the economy? you realize that a long long time ago they where no such things as jump freighters? and the economie still worked, guess what peoples didnt use t2 ships for everything and sourced t1 locally, hence why the drones lands where so strong back than.
---
Bye felicia
---
too complex.
---
remove cyno from T3C is easier. Litterally just two lines in the game files.
---
I'm sure it was more concern for selling toons for real life cash.  Skill injectors are a safer more legal way of getting a toon you want.
---
i assume he means that F to cyno vigil events
---
&gt; There is no way any of your change have meaningful impact unless you remove the injectors! 
---
Numerous balance passes on other ships and mechanics would like to disagree.
---
It would be like one of those old text games, I remember playing them at school on a BBC. Sail north 2 miles, sail ssw 3 miles, you spot nothing.
---
Then you're part of the problem.
---
Wasn't even a bait, more like pure sarcasm. Calm your tits.
---
Hi all, so grateful for all of the discussion created from my last video on the economy of internet spaceships. I though I would make a follow up talking about something very topical both to EVE online as well as the world economy as a whole.
---
As always if I have broken any sub rules with my shameless plug feel free to remove this post. 
---
Otherwise I hope you enjoy and I look forward to chatting with you guys again about this amazing game!
---
huh?  no everybody was already using bombers for drops.  as they are incredibly overpowered, cheap and easy to fly.  if you dropped other sub caps, you were using HACs which now will be replaced by T3Cs or trig ships which, yea again will be replaced by bombers or T3Cs.
---
Tbh I see this killing dreadbombs. How can you bring in an effective dreadbomb w/o a hard Cyno? Literally any decent subcap fleet will alpha a recon so there’s no way to reliably drop dreads on enemy dreads if they have a support fleet.
---
&gt;(even getting a killmark on my Orca once) 
---
You consider that an accomplishment?
---
I've been figuratively subbed for a decade, but only literally subbed on and off
---
whats the Ehp and sigradius of the ships dropping a cyno currently for dread bombs
---
Training.....lol
---
Considering op is complaining about the long cyno 5 training....
---
Seems like that is a Huge thing.
---
I'm aware of how it works and it does show on overview as a warpable object if you are on the same grid with it (it also lasts seconds instead of minutes).
---
Not really sure what point you are trying to make.
---
Can I have your isk?
---
Bye
---
What if I told you that there are small corps in null and in wormholes?
---
Haha. So, when I look at zkillboard I see all my kills and losses so no idea what you're doing wrong but you're definitely doing something wrong. Maybe you're as bad at pvp as you are at looking characters up on zkill ;)
---
Yeah, they're nerfing just about everything that people use to make isk apart from wormhole activities and explo, in an attempt to get more subs. Hell they even stopped alphas from being able to do L4's. The excuse was "bots" but then they don't want an anti cheat, they'd rather nerf gameplay instead.
---
Very few people like whelping a load of ships and then getting out the credit card to buy more. If many players can't make money in game to afford ships without participating in hours of dull exploration, moving to a wormhole, or relying on a ton of PI alts, they're gonna play other things.
---
Marginally sure, but we already know that major alliances won't suffer a death of a thousand paper cuts.
---
and now their laughed at gobbins horde is the major power of them, serves them right.
---
Also, I found a fit which had WCSs for travel and I still lost the ship because the people who killed me fitted themselves for the task. So.... it can clearly be done and you're complaining because you're refusing to fit your ship to kill the things you want to kill.
---
Yeah fixing exploits is bad!!  
---
creating exploits is good!!
---
instead of mining grab some kind of high tracking cruiser and kill em. I got about 26mil in loot and salvage from 2 spawns and a 3rd spawn appeared before i left the system.
---
shit dead ass corps
---
&gt; assuming there's a defense fleet and they can PANIC
---
  You underestimate the Krab in krabs
---
wormholers got worked up about hics because it wasn't aimed at changing how they roll, it was aimed at the larger use of over propped hics so it was hurting a much smaller population unintentionally. This change is aimed at hurting the current use of cynos.
---
I'm actually still flying my super old Astero I fitted back when I was in Signal Cartel. this is the fit: 
---
[Astero, Signalstero]
---
F-89 Compact Signal Amplifier
---
F-90 Compact Sensor Booster
---
Small Low Friction Nozzle Joints I
---
Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade II
---
[Empty Rig slot]
---
ECCM Script x1
---
Hornet EC-300 x5
---
its made for quick scanning and fast warping. with under 2 sec align time you can get off grid pretty fast. and even with the mwd running you are still under 3 sec which I find kinda neat. I've been flying that thing through wormholes and null sec for quite some time now.
---
Some of you are truley retarded.
---
CCP should just add a new ship, T1 varient of the monitor as a cyno ship. Less slots. Lower fitting, less tanky. Easy to balance.
---
i can agree, all the changes hit the numbers of active players. And the smaller your coalition/alliance ist or relys on ratting the smaller it gets atm. On top of that eve has a huge problem with the new player experience and retain those. Most of the new player's in the statistic are alt accounts nowadays. We are even under the login numbers before alpha account where introduced. Summertime Saga is onething people will now put out but our actual numbers are like 2006.
---
No, I'm in favour of leaving things as they are considering I think it's working fine at the moment. I don't generally buy WCSs but if they went up to 30mill I certainly wouldn't buy them, I'd sell the 1000 or so I have in my main hanger. Then I'd buy them back when CCP inevitably reduced the cost due to the enormous backlash of the actual player base rather than the extremely vocal minority of which you're a part.
---
That might have been the case a long time ago. Since citadels and and the loosening of jump clone restrictions there is no way dedicated alts are still a majority.        
---
And even if they are, they should at least be able to board basic ships. It's not like the char is stuck in any case.
---
I mean ceptor &gt; dread or fax with a Cyno. The initial Cyno is light but after that your hard Cyno is a cap. You lose that cheap initial Cyno and now have to have multiple Recons to bring them in. This is huge as it mean you will lose dreads to spawning at sun since cynos will be popped as fast as possible. So now not only are the attackers having the disadvantage of loading grid but they also have to lose multiple force recons AND at least some of their dreads won’t even make it onto the field.
---
Then it's worse than I thought. We're doomed
---
&gt; Now just rich players Inject Recon alts and keep making isk at current levels
---
But being more vulnerable then before, since Recon alt can be killed, off-grid cyno can be bubbled and etc.
---
I play ~2 years, and if there was no injectors - I guess I'd just quit, since the only way to get interesting content would be buying characters.
---
The problem is that in most cases adapting doesn't mean do the activity differently, it just means go and do a different activity.
---
Remember before capital ratting and rorquals how people made money?
---
High sec incursion alts, that's how. That's where we're regressing to.
---
We dunk goons at least once a week so I wouldn't call us dead.
---
As opposed to being cloaked ?
---
A force recon alt.
---
calm down miner
---
The hard part about bringing a pilgrim to 100k ehp is fitting the second medium neut. Otherwise it is quite easy.
---
The curse though..
---
wat
---
so its the hard cyno, and server ticks etc making people land at the sun that causes the issue for you.
---
i mean, what is the dreadbomb bombing, a solo ratter, isnt going to blap a blops in miliseconds. not with 1 or more fax jumping with it, blops with fax is the hard cyno, adapt.
---
or maybe your talking about the HUGE nullbloc alliance level fights, im pretty sure they can deal with having to field a couple of blops and primary them with some reps to hold a cyno on grid.
---
everyones cried for capital nerfs and hotdrop nerfs, this is fucking it. enjoy it and adapt to it i say
---
Sounds painful. I prefer the darkness. 
---
I miss gifs ingame.    
---
You had to have real kahunas to read local in those days.

blackout reason = free intel. Dotlan NPC Kills = free intel. Dunno why those things are not also blackouted btw.
---
Actually we were doomed 26,500 years ago
---
The fact is you lack the infrastructure to help new players and you teach them bad habits and how to hate and be "elite".
---
Its cute you think you matter &lt;3
---
so 3 more months only, thank God
---
A few years ago I posted about the [On the universality of Skill Injectors](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6ic9xl/on_the_universality_of_skill_injectors/), and potential changes to slow the rate at which people can throw SP around. 
---
I still think it's worth considering.
---
but i was using my fastest craw... craw craw craw..
---
Unattested might have been on purpose... maybe it’s a philosophical observation that without local no one can attest to their presence. And he’s asking how it feels to travel unnoticed and I acknowledged through a strange land. Sounds like a friendly neighbor making sure they’re in a good spot emotionally.
---
another idea just for giggles:
---
falcon eye
---
this drug is composed of the same substances as the well know red eye. Enhanced with drifter technology it may look like a oversized glow stick but it's potential is extreme. Even touching the vial will send tingly sensations through your body since the effects are transmitted like radiation to penetrate each and every biological barrier inside your body. Consuming this drug puts you in a state where you can focus indefinately into the distance by increasing and focusing down your senses, making movement of your body a challenge and your mind susceptable to even minor irritiation around you.
---
main effect: increasing jump distance by 150%, increasing signature resolution by 200%, increasing targetting distance by 200%, weapon/fighter optimal range increased by 200%, falloff set to 0
---
side effects: jump fatigue maxed out after jumping immediately, limiting max target locks to 1, speed reduced by 95%, intertia increased by 200%, all resistances are reduced to 0, warp core strength limited to 1, ecm resistance limited to (frigate levels), weapon and drone tracking reduced by 90%
---
would be hell of a gamble, making you an practically easy target (tackle able with a single long point, blind you and your fighters easily, immovable, easy to bump around) as long as you dont fuck it up and fly a straight line.
---
but remove wormhole savety in the entry mechanic for wormholes would be necessary.
---
Not really. Technically, yes, but they might as well not exist for all the good they do for contributing moongoo to the economy.
---
Greetings!
---
  All the chaos era is literally and directly focused on specific group of players and their game style. They mastered the art and you all need to change the rules of the "monopoly" you need to adjust it to suit you and put the enemy in disadvantage. So weak you are, congratulations!
---
as someone who's been playing in a small alliance in npc null: last i heard, that alliance is now mostly dead. i had taken a break just before local blackout started, and i'm currently thinking of completely abandoning the game. for me, eve was nice for being able to grow my own industrial empire, plan things ahead of time, and the occasional pvp (either as logi, or solo roaming in a drake because that was fun to me). now, i'd have to deploy structures along my entire jump route for my industry (including especially lowsec), and train up all my cyno alts to be able to use covop cynos. that'd take several months, and i'm not going to give ccp the money for skill injectors. and this wasn't a change i could have planned for in time, preparing the alts in advance. so, my industry would now have come to a grinding halt if i hadn't taken the break; mining is impossible without enormous effort, so casual play in that regard is out as well (small alliance; we don't have the numbers to permanently camp the gates to our systems, and the entities around us have more members, and more capitals, and the advantage of an attack is always with the aggressor as they know when they'll attack and thus only need to be ready at that time. the defenders need to be ready \*all\* the time, as they don't know when an attack will happen). mission running and exploration isn't something i like, either, so i have neither active nor passive income sources. i could go back to highsec, but that has its own problems and i'd rather manage my mining fleet actively than just use some tanky orcas avoiding code.
---
so: 
---
1) playstyle - no longer viable
---
2) income - none
---
3) planability - gone
---
would leave me with doing my solo drake roams as an option, but not even knowing if there's targets in the system (and if there are, dying anyway because a drake can't win many fights, and can't run from them either), and i'd usually have to travel 40 jumps before to find anything... nah, no longer sounds like fun
---
current mood: winning eve, possibly for good. and no, you can't have my stuff.
---
water. You should try it, this drug is strong.
---
neh, this is too easy. Just let everyone log in with ctrl+f9 enabled as default, with no way of turning it off
---
removed it from all ship but force recon and blops needs two lines in the game files.
---
You could make them progressively harder. And the point isnt that we all die, for one its content, we have to fight for our survival. But like killing us all isnt gonna make the game better. It that would be a cost of keeping space. And some regions would fall under trig control opening up new PvE content and so on.
---
Anything would be better than letting trigs shoot structure 400 times/day and instablapping people on gates.
---
How original
---
&gt;infrastructure
---
We hand out free ships and teach them how to fly on their own. Not only how to follow orders and hit the shoot button like the average goon f1 monkey
---
It's like making fun of how old people say meme
---
Only CCP have nerfed the number of high sec incursions too. Which is a joke, since 5% of bounties are from high sec. The rest are low or null. 
---
They even made L4's unavailable for alphas. 
---
Making it harder for people to get ships/pay for a sub won't win them players. Sure a few new credit card warriors will emerge, but I wonder if they can keep the game afloat when people who don't want to live in a wormhole, station trade with bots all day, or explo constantly decide to leave.
---
except they promised they would review it, not they would change it.
---
Yeah it's a subtle difference, I understand you missed it.
---
I started playing in 2016 so I'm relatively new (playing on and off) and injectors have been an awesome catch up mechanic. I don't think I would've stayed that active if not for them. I don't buy them with real cash since I'm a poor scrub. I grind the isk, when I get to about 1.5b I treat myself with an injector. Not that it puts a dent into the ever increasing training queue, but it's nice that occasionally if I want to fly something on a whim, I can. After 3 years, I'm at 30 mil SP which isn't great, but it's not terrible either.  
---
The above isn't really meant to persuade you to the benefits, but it just sheds a light on the little/new player perspective which I don't see around at all.
---
Its just another marvel movie being made, relax.
---
Or would it?
---
If we would make a swift change it could fix the capital problem
---
Ships with their own jump drives don’t ever end up at the sun.
---
This only happens with ships that are bridged
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEREEEEEEEEEREEEREERRRŔEEEEEEEEEE
---
adapt etc
---
I don't think it's restrictive enough.
---
So why did we see deflation then? And why are we going to get inflation now?
---
Blue loot is the faucet. From drifter sites I guess, dunno WH PvE either, just know that its far worse than NS/capita. Its almost 50% from what I gather of NS yet the difference between players is night and day.
---
They everyone would just for the cheapest bullshit ship possible and it would be business as usual.
---
Nope, pay money for your cynos nerds :)
---
How do you mean?
---
are you aiming this just at me, ive tried to put into words what you did so easily.
---
 ''they promised they would review it, not they would change it''
---
although i think i started with this statement. and i will continue to standby they did not 'promise' anything. they stated they would do something. they are a business so theres none of this 'promise' bullshit,
---
they started they will 'look at' and 'think about' this as time progresses to patch day. which they will. they kind of have to as theyre implementing the patch and watching the chaos. you cant do this without completing what they said they plan to do.
---
which it is just that, a plan, not a promise, not a deceleration. there is no promises in business, just business. and theyre doing a grand job, and havent missed a beat since blackout IMO (admittedly not long)
---
50-50 loot loot fairy on a BPO that is worth how much unresearched? 30b? More?
---
And this one was researched, no one is risking that.
---
Probably swapped temporarily when you were on intel
---
You're an idiot.
---
I’m sure the game will evolve. I’m just pretty sure dread brawls are not quite dead but much less likely. Which is a shame since they’re one of the few fun types of cap fights.
---
I double this. I got a little more hardcore on farming, but main reason is same.
---
For me all this "Injectors kills the game" from old-players sound like "I do not want anyone to catch-up with me!"
---
And yes, I know, I know, rorqual alts and etc. But that was easily achievable with character trading. And Injectors helps new guys like I was to get skills that missing. (Because I had no idea what character I need and what skills)
---
Wow so bare minimum then? and you think you are helping. Cute
---
Weird. 
---
New players "catching up" never really was a big problem. Sure, you could not fast train into T2 ships or capitals, but groups always had a backup for people who were just training into a new doctrine (and still have, since alphas also can't use T2 ships).
---
Getting into tackle or a t1/meta-fit cruiser/bc always was an option. Ofc these days, you might get clubbed by a F1 drone who injected into Muninn or Eagle, back then that player was in a Hurricane or Rupture and you at least had a chance of killing him.
---
So no, you do not need injectors to catch up to old players (to catch up to them you would need a couple billion ISK in assets and on your wallet as well btw), you need them to keep up with other new players who have a credit card.
---
News flash: You were never meant to play a MMO game all by yourself with 93870273928 other toons of yours. You wanna mine? Do it with other people. You wanna JF? Get a help of a corp mate. It is fuckin MMO, what is wrong with you people?! Go play farmville or something.
---
I don't get why a lot of people are so hyped about this. I think this will result in even less content. I know you won't see me risking my super/carrier for ratting anymore. I've already started training my chars into abyssal frigs to run T4/T5 sites. Makes nearly/just as much as a super and you are risking barely anything.
---
No.
---
Man I wish there was a way to maybe train skillpoints on these alts, or maybe if CCP did some events to give away free SP, or maybe even a way to pay real money for SP (not that I think this is healthy, it exists).
---
They could maybe even give you like a month or so heads up on changes so you have plan for them 🤷‍♂️
---
You can have expensive targets with cynos and an umbrella in populated space or you can have no cyno umbrella and empty space.  Choose one.
---
beside that they missed their goal of retaining players or improve the new player experience so they stay in the game. But hey new players will totally stick to the game when a trig invasion (which it does atm) kill their soa arc experience lol.
---
Ty for this im so mad etc.
---
We have to see that we have a capital problem, they are a bit  op. 
---
but I think they should be. 
---
We could  introduce higher build cost for capitals while addind a trig invasion to lower the number of capitals that way caps stay strong while
---
-making them a group effort again
---
-lowering their number thus making them more expensive
---
Whitch could prevent dropping them on everything that moves
---
Caps don't sunbounce
---
Read this, now you may believe the site if you want or not but I have heard this from multiple sources and I think CCP themselves have mentioned it  [http://dev.elapse.se/inn/dispatch/more-rorqual-and-nullsec-changes-on-the-horizon/](http://dev.elapse.se/inn/dispatch/more-rorqual-and-nullsec-changes-on-the-horizon/). 
---
So no, you are not right. Its a common fact by now that the CSM expressly said the rorq changes would be bad.
---
Just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks only means you dont know whats wrong. 
---
Na dude, thats not worst case. You will see.
---
I judge people on past behaviour. CCPs trackrecord has been shit when it comes to iteration. Thats just a plain fact. But listen dude, I dont need to convince you. You do you.
---
This made me laugh, take my upvote, looks like you could use it.
---
Now I get it...
---
Not even close. You heard of cyno beacons ?
---
you are nit picking on terms ans completely missing the point.
---
and BTW if there is no promise, there is no trust. If there is no trust, there is no business.
---
So yeah making promise is the basis of trade. Your "plan" is actually a promise.
---
I’m not gonna be multi boxing just to play this game. That mechanic being a requirement to solo capital pve is trash.
---
You really should not mix shield and armor tank. Or plates and nanofibers.
---
majority have already said they wish they would stop trying to keep people in and fix the reason theyre leaving,
---
WAAAY more people have done or wanted to leave due to capital issue,s and krabbing meta being farming simulator for everyone around them xD
---
theyve missed nothing myfriend. once again, a view taken from one perspective, (which in turn would be my view too) rather than trying to think about everyone.
---
You don’t need to multibox. You can also jump to cynos if other people in your fleet.
---
&gt; Getting into tackle or a t1/meta-fit cruiser/bc always was an option.
---
But I did not want to get in t1/meta-fit cruiser. How many months you need to fly BC with normal drones/bonus? I have no idea, but I guess around 2-3.
---
Not to mention that I spent my first months to skill up trading, and was not interested to fly in big fleets and smash F1.
---
&gt;So no, you do not need injectors to catch up to old players
---
So yes, I did need them. And yes indeed, I also needed to get not a couple, but a lot of billions of ISK too.
---
&gt;you need them to keep up with other new players who have a credit card.
---
Said who? I needed to catch up with old players to be able to fight them.
---
I remember this. Because i was drinking too.
---
So then it doesn't matter what that cynos price is?
---
They'll always pick the cheapest?
---
So....even making cynos only on Titans won't solve it right? Because it's still just the cheapest ship
---
This change is going to reduce the amount of carriers and supercarriers that krab in anoms. This will reduce the inflation growth. This is good for the economy
---
Honestly anything it should be limited to sub-capital only and only to cruiser and battleship size ships.
---
I think it’s hilarious. People spent loads of isk / dollars / whatever to skill into the most afk of isk generators.
---
A balance to this system was obvious, they chose to ignore it.
---
Have you tried to kill a ratter in delve lately?
---
You didn't actually provide any amount of context.
---
if you believe this so be it, im going to go ahead and guess correctly you dont run or own a successful or even a failing business. nor have any large role in business agreements,
---
im sure this sounded great to you though so thumbs up.
---
unfortunately there is trust, people/customers like yourself think this is some kind of promise, which gives you trust in them. if it goes wrong, they can point out that it was not a promise, it was a plan they withold the right to change at any time. and no part was 'we promise to' or 'written contract we will do this OR'
---
im picking out points to show my point, and prove its value.
---
It does require input, they need to continuously change the meta so people will inject into other skills.
---
The cyno change would be fine if counter play options existed for undetectable and unengageable cloaked ships. As it stands why even undock? The PVE player that isn't part of a mega alliance can't do anything, and there's not enough time to save much of anything besides a rorq or super against a hunting.. sorry I mean afk hunting group.
---
What the fuck did you smoke ? Rorquals are barely impacted by this change, what the fuck do you want to do against it if they already have a blop/recon on grid when you land, combined why a cyno beacon in system ?
---
This will restore nothing. Also Rorquals stopped being good risk vs reward-wise long ago. The umbrella + multiboxing is what make it strong, the ship itself is a 10b red painted target mining barely 80 to 100m an hour.
---
Multiple accounts = money making for CCP
---
Injectors = money making for CCP
---
Blackout = money making for CCP (people buy plex to buy ships rather than ratting/mining)  
---
While i do agree that CCP should make money to continue working on the game and make it better and better I don't see a way you can remove injectors or multiple account which is also an issue. Just imagine for a second that you could enjoy EVE without having tons of Alts.
---
you realise that injectors just give "old-players" more ability to min-max their characters and make the gap to catch up wider though right?
---
On the subject of character trading you were limited by what was available to buy, the number of rorq alts available to buy would be tiny compared to how many have been injected.
---
Rather than make it easier to catch up I'd say injectors have made it more necessary to catch up because of how easy it is for people to just have max skills in the latest FOTM PvP (or PvE) ship
---
No, hunters want easy frags. Because as soon as you drop caps/ or get a decent defence fleet up and in the area they piss off.
---
Some of you can't spell truly.
---
Well TBH if he doesn't have a decent cyno alt for a JF than that seems like a hindsight problem. 
---
It's only a month I believe it takes longer to get into a recon well fit.
---
Honestly the change so that jfs can take coverts is pretty big alone. Op just wants crab sec back.. but it's cancer for the game.
---
I’m upset that I actually clicked the link.
---
The possibillety for a roqual to light a cyno is the only Thing keeping the Game alife If you deaktivate that Bombers will have a free Fuckparty wehreever Somebody is Mining  there is No counterplay to bomberfleets roming right now so Stop crying thaht its to hard for you to kill some excavatorts 😂
---
Wow you're retarded...
---
because that's what the r/Eve community has devolved into...
---
i hope they brake things, i hope they farm mroe salt than Pirat, i hope they do fix things after! but i hope for more of this chaos. dont stop. keep going, there is no limit in this virtual word. tear this shit up.
---
hell ive already made 4bill from the changes, keep em comming while people cry they cant make isk
---
Generally, price of finished product minus price of components. Should give you a general idea.
---
That's a matter of choice, if you can't think of a way of keep doing the same and/or rather go do something different that's up to you.
---
This game has been going on since way before the massive isk making activities like Rorq mining and Super ratting, and people still made isk before Incursions.
---
If you can't understand that CCP is trying to nerf isk being generated in general then you are more stupid than I previously thought. 
---
*"Oh noes! I'll have lower ticks!"*
---
Cry me a river.
---
See the situation: There was literally zero risk if you were krabbing in a cap under the Cap Umbrella. 
---
You literally had to make a mistake to get dunked on the grid i.e. if you already didn't GTFO due to Intel, big fleets still get reported. 
---
And to get dunked, the other side needs to assemble a few dozen pilots, find a wh,  fly and jump through several systems and hope you aren't reported and then land on grid and hope other guy makes a few mistakes.
---
In scenario where you blop in, the krab still needs to make several mistakes before it can be saved.
---
So, little or no risk with immense rewards. 
---
Now, you can still get dank isk but there is risk, there is setup involved and worst case scenario you loose the cyno ship against a competent group.
---
So, scenario has gone from zero risk / dank rewards to some risk/dank rewards.
---
Krabbers are crying because they've gotten it too easy for last few years, they will adapt, or die, such is life in Eve.
---
Honestly, caps are pretty shit. They got EHP but thats about it. Can they kill stuff? Sure, can they be soloed by subs? Ye. They are far from the thing people are making them out to be. Not even capital blobs are all that strong anymore, not against a decent comp. But dropping 3 supers on 10 people, ofc, in that situation they are oppressive. But they should be.
---
I mean ye that sounds great. Literally anything would be better than the current shit. Plus it would be content, I mean we could have had fun for atleast a year with it. Just like every other game does with expansions, they change tons of things. 
---
The stagnation we are seeing isnt just playermade, its also very much CCP made. The last expansion that was semigood was citadels, nothing since then has actually been of value. Lifeblood had some decent things in it but it killed the main content driver, moons. That shattered LS completely but also NS, no point in having multiple regions or anything anymore.
---
I mean, honestly, CCP is pretty much the only company that thinks progression is all about nerfing things. Instead they should be creating counters for balance, not just cutting things out but instead adding new things.  Thats progression.
---
Yet you're still here
---
Why data and relic I? I'm still really new but is there a reason why you don't have II?
---
whatever lol.
---
They promised they will "look at it" and people are complaining because they want a promise to "revert it".
---
you are picking out useless details to prove a useless point.

---
Just know it started with a rapier on the titans. I can't control all those living in the past :p
---
Unfortunate part of all this is my rapier died... aaaaand the market is bought out. Fml
---
they won't remove injectors because there are just enough sheep to keep buying them
---
Unless you plan on combat, go for inertial stabs so that align is sub 2s.  This will help you escape most hunters.
---
Our CEO knows every newbro (3-4 per week) by name and has talked to them separately to help them improve. That's what not being just a number means. I don't expect you to understand.
---
200 bombers seems a lil over exageration..
---
&gt; you realise that injectors just give "old-players" more ability to min-max their characters and make the gap to catch up wider though right?
---
Well, "old-players" will have to pay a lot more for same amount of sp then new ones. And yes, some of them can afford it, but, for example, for cruiser-bs size it's not hard to max your potential I guess somewhere around 30-50m sp? It'd be almost perfect(if not perfect) pilot for any t1-t2-pirate battleship.
---
And also you do not need to max it, you just need to have it on good levels. And Injectors helped me on the way. Yes, they also could help old players(for much higher price), but I am totally fine with it.
---
it's already far too late, the damage has been done and making any actual changes to injectors will only deter players from the game... people will be saying something along the lines of "why did X get to inject all that SP a month ago and now I can't?"
---
Uhhh, redeemer, panther, and sin all can? Maybe 1.5-2b fits. I'm off to work but I'll link some tonight.
---
Go  to the finance section of the EVE Online forums.
---
In those forums, there lies lots of trust/collateral brokers.
---
They normally only deal in amounts of 1-2 billion ISK and above. They normally charge 2-5% interest monthly. with a third party holding your collateral.
---
If you are new to that crowd, you will never get more than 1 bill with collateral. To get larger amounts takes a time investment, familiarity, and long term trust of the third party brokers; often called a reputation (rep) grind.
---
You seem to want the change to be circumventable. Its unlikely anybody who understands the problem would want that.
---
That's some high-level argument. Thank you for taking time to write it.
---
Because "community. "  Nullsec EVE is all about finding a group of people to play other, better, games with
---
If your super doesn't have a heavy neut and a smartbomb you're doing it wrong.
---
If the bait was so bad, why did you take it?
---
Causing mass account drops isn’t the way to get any money back?  What?
---
Do you really think they bought CCP for their 25.000 active acounts mmorpg and for their 15.000 player base game ? Really? Is that what you think? Black Desert Online brought them 1 bil in 4 years. Do you think EVE can bring in revenue 1 bil in the next 4 years ? :)
---
Well we are not cutting things out here we add a lot of content
---
 and here's the trick we remove some caps from the game
---
 and weee cap haters are overjoyed
---
 we add trig citadels everyone is interested
---
 we get trig roquals miners jumping from joy and and that's the way on the field  option To get the caps back
---
Your target won't be able to escalate either because they'll be just as retarded as before. 
---
You're telling me that your 3-5 sabres can't hold something in place while a nano force recon burns?
---
Or that you can't bridge in a recon to a covert prospect so that it can light a hard cyno?
---
yeah, I was thinking when watching "WTF is that fit ?"
---
I was going through some stuff last night for fun and realized that the widow can get to 300k HP and fit a cyno on it. It actually has a use now!
---
Pretty much, every change they're hyping is pretty much just going to lead to stagnation if you think about it for 2 seconds.  Too bad Hilmtard has a severe case of squirrel-nut syndrome and can't focus on anything for more than 2 seconds to actually think about cause and effect.
---
So you're saying it'd take a megalodon to eat my massive dick?
---
Looking at your killboard, I see no point where you had a sudden increase in skillpoints and kills, that could not have been archieved with normal training speed since the day you created your character.
---
Injectors are for "I want it all and I want it now", which is an awesome song by Queen, but doesn't fit into EVE IMO.
---
If by "circumvent able" you mean "following the new rules" then...yes...
---
That's the entire point.
---
No matter what ship you require, someone can still put it on an alt and have them sit nearby.
---
im not so sure, i think cap drops will happen less in the smaller groups, which was needed as who they were fighting often couldnt escalate. and those who do risk expensive hulls or failure without true investment.
---
and large blocs simply see the drop comming before the cyno is lit. nothing more. kinda nice tbh.
---
trust me, i love dreads, capital fights, i recently had awesome fun on defence in my shitfit nidhogger blapping munnins with a whole bunch with my nullbloc. that will still happen too. 
---
the age of blops is here, expect 256 railgus vs 256 arty loki fights to come. and they now have a place for that SOE supercapital ive always said will come one day with a capital covert cloak :D xD
---
y r u a meanie to me then?
---
Yeah, now if could use station less systems for jump chains.
---
given how swimmingly well delve has been going for some time now, i think the facts back us up
---
There are ways to allow for both worlds. Certain skills could have restricted for instance. I like injectors, ive used tons myself, but they allowed for a massive overheating of everything.
---
Don't forget, all this time FozzieSov and Shitadel is counting down in real time!  Wonderful design, Hilmar!  Glad you're focused on the important stuff!
---
EVE, the IFR update
---
I baby sit goons on a daily basis
---
Realistically, the cyno change doesn't amount to more than a delaying tactic, or rather, it would if there weren't such a thing as injectors.
---
All this is just a cyno tax with no fundamental impact on how users play the game.  On net, it makes participating in capital ship content a DLC for whales.  Wasn't it always though?
---
Congrats on telling CODE just who and where they should be looking for a proud AFK miner to gank.
---
Or it will mean you stop trying to play an mmo as a solo player and work together as a corp.
---
Lol, seems that way.
---
being afk is by definition not playing the game.
---
Nerf panic
---
No they won't because it won't be worth it.  It's already borderline not worth it simply because there are many far more interesting things you could be doing with your time than playing Eve.
---
:P
---
Does that include the mods on the structure or are those in the wreck?
---
&gt;The majority of eves player base likes pve activities.
---
Omegalul
---
Listen i am not saying that a umbrella metric is a good thing, i have infact augured against it forever. But the current tack of just running around hitting shit with a nerf bat without looking at balance is neither sustainable nor does it make since.  It forces smaller alliances to merge in with the mega allainces, and now without any direct counter to say 40 bomber drops, or dread drops on ratters/miners all it does is skew the combat advantage wildly in the other direction. Not to mention making a actual capital fight less likely. 
---
I agree that change needs to happen, but unbalanced changes are bad for the overall game. 
---
Also before you tell me how I am fighting for MY crabbing lifestyle, understand this. I have never flown a capital that wasnt combat fit fleet or solo, I have never flown a rorq that wasnt heavy tackle, I have never operated a mining barge without a scram and a cyno.
---
orrrr you just fucking suck at internet arguing because you lack any real support for your shit opinions and fail to put forth any effort in understanding the realities
---
The real risk is when you light the Cyno and are stuck in place with a “warp to shiny killmail” beacon for 5-10 minutes. Or you suicide Cyno a few hundred million ISK instead of a few million.
---
Wait.... so you don’t have alts at all? Then nothing changes for you then. 🤷‍♂️
---
Large thumbs small phone many beers who dis?
---
I think the ship selection is actually perfect. It's very well balanced, it doesnt favour pve or pvp or vice versa. You start adding it to things like dictors and hictors then it's just stupid. This is actually well balanced the way it us. You have a light cyno that will die in a fire everywhere (recon) and a more expensive heavy cyno (blops) 
---
Literally its about time there is a major risk to consider when lighting a cyno, it's desperately needed. For the first time they did something right here.
---
I play with... Sorry, i ment BY myself and no complaints :)
---
a nulli t3 can, but a force recon can't, not in a timely fashion and not in any kind of reliable way
---
you should add \[sarcasm\] in your title, some people may actually think you agree with what you wrote.
---
&gt;  Sounds like a friendly neighbor making sure they’re in a good spot emotionally.
---
Not a common sentiment in New Eden, not unheard of either. Thank you for that perspective, greatly appreciated.
---
They dont care its short term want kills now dont care what happens later
---
look at gankers in HS.
---
They were told they would kill the fishing pond. Yet there are ganks every day.
---
Won't be very quick when a 300k ehp widow lights a cyno and the first things to come through are minnows to rep it for two cycles
---
I literally just addressed his point and even injected a correlating variable directly linked with titan deaths - or do you not understand how super capitals typically die?
---
Agreed. This is a very good change. Every spodbrain is now sperging out. 
---
Bless Bob.
---
You seem to want the change to mean effectively nothing. The game needs fewer cynos. Anything that does not accomplish that goal is a fail.
---
You’ve just been flying it backwards
---
That's a bad fit, move along.
---
Then dont complain about dying
---
But what if this is the point? I mean, look at the dropping PLEX price. Many are superhappy about it without considering what that means. Falling PLEX price means that people that buy PLEX from CCP will make less ingame isk. Prices on everything will soon start to go up which means your isk becomes worth less. Combine those 2 and in a couple of months people will have to buy more PLEX from CCP to get the same amount of ingame value (its already happening, just takes time for it too become evident).
---
Whatever CCPs true intentions behind this age of chaos is, I doubt it will benefit us in the long run.
---
that’s my point
---
Mineral prices spike and PvP/wars now matter?
---
Offer and supply. Instead of making skillfarm we would have made rorqual alts so it s the same.
---
I never used one skill injector (but 20 skillfarm account so i sold a lot) but it s good for the game that a newbro motivated can buy skills. Some older player just dont want new guys to catch them. It s good also for the game : Eve would have been probably dead without it. Remember CCP lay off MANY people 2 years ago. So without it, no eve anymore.
---
I played for 3 years and i can fly titan, carrier, super, super, fax, on different toon. Never injected. So it s not hard also to fly big stuff without injected.
---
This is tipical of ccp, making changes that has more effects than needed. Hey devs if you want affect only the protection umbrellas. Just change those ships, leave jf untouched.
---
Who ?
---
no, you definitely avoid his point.
---
You can make random correlation as much as you want, it does not change that cap umbrella was too effective.
---
Especially since your correlation also states that cap umbrella was too effective, since it prevents dread bombs.
---
So yes, you are only avoiding his point. But doing so you are giving him credit.
---
nah, you have that attitude, you're just mega nearsighted
---
Expansions are free, so always expect to see DLC added in somewhere in roundabout fashion.
---
A game can't be balanced with timesinks anyway, so all injectors are doing is making core game flaws more obvious.  This is because for a lot of players, EVE is only a game they think about in terms of long range plans.  If they start to have to actually play it, then they see that it is dysfunctional, and that content is more a product of accidents than a result of core design.
---
this came from olmeca tho lmao
---
You give the residents of null too much credit. 
---
Picture your average nullsec krab. The person you pictured isn't terribly intelligent, right? Now consider; that was the average person, half of all nullsec krabs are *less* intelligent than that.
---
but cOmPlAcEnCy
---
shut the fUCK up retard
---
It's awesome, all the nulls have so many Sigs to scan that you end up with these insane chains of content that can connect a dozen regions in an hour
---
Players catching up was always a problem. Literally every 2 weeks some newbie posts here asking if they are too late to start EVE and can they ever catch up.
---
Well all of your words need explaining really, because the brain cells behind them seem to be lacking. 
---
You're being asked what is cool and relevant in Eve.
---
maybe you're just locked in an echo chamber of the 6 people you play with and never stopped to think about what "24,000 people" actually means when you look at the connection count on the launcher
---
&gt;gives advantage to big blobs, who can just spam the fuck out of them because they are wealthy as fuck
---
This is different from now?
---
That is because sudden increase in skillpoints does not lead to kills. It just gives you opportunity to make them.
---
But:
---
• my normal speed training since creation of my character was going intro Trading. I joined EVE for fancy trading/logistics/economy. So when I wanted to try PvP I had almost none combat skills and had to inject them.
---
• I totally could wait for my sp to get there, but I did not want to, I wanted to try this and that, wanted to check out if I lose because of my sp, or skills (it was both, lol).
---
And all old players had this "I want it all now" button, they just know what skills they need and could buy char that is close to this. I had no idea what skills I need. I do not know how many Vexors I lost before I found out that there's drone skills! And when I did - I just wanted them to IV, that is all.
---
I think you underestimate the greed of corporations. Corporations like Microsoft will intentionally break their own best selling product if the price is right.
---
Just logged in and checked got both. X type neut and faction bomb 👌
---
I don't see how the umbrella is affected. Please explain. 
---
All I see is its a pain in the ass to move your assets now
---
Show me a Pilgrim at 100k with even one medium neut fit. Go on, I’m waiting.
---
We can hope. I’m not optimistic but it is what it is. Also no way for SOE Titan with covops. Nestor doesn’t even get covops.
---
&gt;give t3c covert ops subsystems the ability to light cynos plz
---
t3c too tanky probably.
---
CCP can be douchebags and permaban you for "impersonating CCP" even when it's obviously a joke.  They've done it before.
---
Less than a day. You can sit in a Bantam or Vigil and have a nonzero impact on fleet fights. People probably won't think you're a hero, but you WILL be helping.
---
Too tanky.
---
Truth.
---
Game is pretty not stagnant to me. There is so much action with blackout right now than I've ever seen
---
Yesterday, you loaded with no recent activity. ^0^
---
Today though...
---
&gt;Find a single fit of mine anywhere that uses WCS.

Honestly, before you issue that sort of challenge, you might want to at least look at the first dozen or so losses on your board. It didn't even require effort.
---
And these are just the ones where you got unlucky. Something tells me you're a regular user of the risk aversion mod. Holy shit. SIX fucking stabs? SIX? I'm shocked you wanted me to look at all. What a tool. HAHA
---
Nice attempt. I found three. Didn't even have to try hard.
---
nestor doesnt, but dont ruin my laughable dreams of a supercapital SOE with a cloaky warp. how hilarious would that be xD
---
but i think, im my years of playing eve, ive been happy and REALLY fucking angry with CCP and their choices, but in the long run, since day one, and the changes that happens before i joined even, they have all been great, the game has adapted. things can still be fun. kill still feel great, and goons still are the satanspawn of nulsec
---
You're missing the point that the alts didn't exist to be bought before at the same level that people are injecting new alts though. As someone who has been playing on and off since 2006 the gap feels larger than ever since injectors came out.
---
Ye no Im with you, this is a great idea, I would love it. I mean, imagine if we had to mine with rorqs in trig space just to get some ore needed for cap production. Like it would be fking chaos, that would be awesome. Groups fighting eachother over access and disturbing the supply lines with hit and runs. 
---
That would honestly make the game feel new again.
---
You could even delete all caps in the game presently and just give back the mats and force us to do everything over again with new updated material requirements. I mean I wouldnt mind that one bit even tho I love my caps. It would take the game several years to reach the current levels of capitals, if ever.
---
you cant have multiple characters train towards a single rorqual character though which made it slower to produce the dedicated alts to sell rather than pooling SP from an SP farm to create a rorqual alt.
---
Definitely need more chaos.
---
I love it.
---
&gt;enormous backlash
---
So you're telling me they're that common? If that's the case, it's an even better argument for giving T2 scram 3 points. Personally I doubt most people use them as much as you do.
---
Also, the very fact you have a thousand of them hanging around tells me you use them regularly. You did fit six on a hurricane. so maybe they wouldn't last that long after all.
---
&gt;WCS peace of mind
---
That sums it up. You're a carebear. Nobody else but one would prioritize "peace of mind".
---
BTW, I move ships in hostile space all the time. Have you ever heard of scouts?
---
I've come across a few gangs with little to no cloaky things while on roams with little to no cloaky things. Not saying there aren't cloakies though since they could have been cloaked
---
Eh I can’t agree with all of that tbh. [angry muttering about citadel spam] Again my gut reaction is that this is a poor change but that is mostly because it only impacts me negatively. All my Cyno alts are useless, all my caps now cost 500m just to move, my rorq is now even more pointless and as a smaller scale FC for Brave I now can’t even easily get cap support when I get dropped.
---
You have to be trolling with that statement!
---
A "tab to recon alt" module
---
are people wanting to revert it. a small portion of the playerbase are critically viewing this thing, (to the stage of unsubbing and stop playing)
---
a streamer did a vote thing online, he got 13% of dislikes for the change, that is a very acceptable amount considering how many people are just scared of change.
---
did you see how much Hilmar loved the feedback of blackout, yet i hear people saying 'everyone hates it'
---
they dont all hate it, most love it, and so does hilmar, and how many doors its opened and freedom its given them to just go and fucking try stuff
---
And we'll just bait the cynos for the ez recon kill all day. 
---
Better than chasing down expensive drones when we don't have enough people online for a proper drop. 
---
I honestly don't see much change in the umbrellas coming other than the cost associated with the new hulls. 
---
Every rorq or super will just keep a cloaked recon on grid somewhere. 
---
Though I *do* look forward to a lot more recordings like the end of This is REALLY EVE. Better get used to "everyone target the Rapier Naow" lmao
---
In a world where they take enormous amounts of logistics and upkeep to deploy and are used as a force multiplyer and not as the force? Like in the real world, you know? 
---
Also lmao for mentioning caps and effort in the same sentence in tyool 2019. Get out you carebear.
---
I honestly dont think they even care anymore. Its just money to them now. Im honestly more disappointed in us as a playerbase being so divided, they could never have pulled this shit if we banded together.
---
Why would they be against toon selling? That was actually limited by training time.
---
Not wrong. Quit EVE because losing ships got too expensive and getting ISK is too boring.
---
And the answer has always been no, even before skill injectors
---
they wanted capital ownership to be a serious involvedment, tick
---
they wanted less people dropping in small groups onto small sub caps, tick
---
they want to rip the meta and see what happens, tick
---
CCP have been scared to do big changes clearly. (things like remove wipe, or limit structures) well with this snowball effect of huge changes just think they might grow the balls to bring the citadel mechanic to its knees.
---
CCP has a long history of not doing shit until its too late.  See: like 5 games that failed/never released and almost caused bankruptcy.  Also see:  Almost every major EVE change in the last 5 years that has led to where we're at today.   You have an awful lot of blind faith considering the evidence to the contrary.
---
Also, when people leave, even if changes get rolled back, a lot of them don't return.  This game can't afford to hemorrhage too many more people over retarded changes.
---
a tech demo without content.
---
It's my fit.
---
Woah big TIL for me also
---
&gt; The bottom line is that they do not want toon selling to come back
---
It never stopped, the bazaar is still a thing.
---
yep . Thx CCP killed my game i am done. I wish i did not pay for a year sub at the beginning of year in  January. Lesson learned. I am winning eve by quitting . No you cant have my stuff, Yes your entitled to your its great opinion. Enjoy when its just  the die hard pvpers left  out in null while everyone else quits .
---
&gt;A hard cyno for a dreadbomb or something I'd imagine . . . But the tankiest blops still gets blapped instantly in any fleet fight.
---
I mean, this shouldn't be surprising.  Its not like anyone at CCP actually understands fleet fight/null mechanics anymore.
---
Well disguised, high-risk RMT these days
---
Cares?
---
That's why I said "drastic change in player behaviour"
---
People used to afk cloak in null to scare people, if there is a decloak timer now with the blackout they will just logoff in a safe when they're not on and log back in when active, it won't make any difference...
---
No, i dont think it did. I don't think ccp talked to csm at all
---
Only people crying seem to be the miners. Funny that.
---
They are/were heavily used in Wormholes. Leshak/Drekavac fleets have mostly replaced them, but they are still useful in situations where the wormhole is mass limited.
---
BUT don't forget to check if there are actual buyers for the finished product . Buy orders + sold volume. If no one is buying, the bpc is useless
---
Not lower-level than the bs you're talking... "Easy to catch up for new players" With what isk? The one you buy with real money, thinking you're gonna be able to reach anything with your new bought skills of ships you have no idea on how to fly... Yeah... No, thats just shoving money in ccp's ass for no more fun than going the actual route and learning the game as you get skills. As it used to be, when the game was healthier than it is now.  
---
If you would've quit the game because you couldn't use injectors thats a clear sign that something else is wrong with the game thats not gonna be fixed by injectors.
---
&gt; *You can make random correlation as much as you want,* 
---
Man... you are impressively dumb. If a titan dies then there are dreads, supers, or other titans. A titan death to sub-capitals is extremely EXTREMELY rare.
---
&gt; *Especially since your correlation also states that cap umbrella was too effective,* 
---
What? No you dumbass, I'm implying a lack of dread bombs = lack of titan deaths.
---
&gt; *So yes, you are only avoiding his point.* 
---
No I think you are just illiterate.
---
I don't trust polls I did not fabricate myself.
---
Sure people love and hate it, but the most visible people are those crying that their gameplay has been changed. In this case it is about the OP : as I see it, he thinks the idea would be to detrimental for him and thus ask for modification that would fit him better.
---
Also I read the original post again to which you answered, and there is no notion of "promise" in it : it says "CCP did state they will revisit th change," . So I'm afraid you are doing a strawman AND nitpicking. Just saying, don't take that personally please.
---
naw cos that would add risk to the promised children that are the hunters so no chance of that
---
That it wont make any difference other than some training time. Its actually a buff for logistics in a sense.
---
And ye, youre not really affected so you dont really need to adapt. You are still not suffering the consequenses but rather just enjoying the perks.
---
that's the idea, and when WH is a better place, they can bomb null and be done.
---
someone needs attention irl
---
Can someone explain is an apparent dumbfuck (me), what "flagged by the community" means......
---
I play on low graphics settings.
---
From a maneuverability standpoint a ship that big would need thrusters on the ring and it should be on the front, wouldn't it?
---
I mean have you owned caps? From my perspective they’re already a huge pita w/o much of a upside. This just means I’ll never move them outside legacy space cause fuck spending for a recon Cyno. Cyno beacons or nothing. 
---
We’ll see how well this affect dropping caps on small groups. I actually think it’ll stay the same as those small groups will now have one, maybe two cynos with them and if you kill them then you’re home free to drop all you want. 
---
Tbh this seems to mostly just try to neuter the super umbrella. (which is stupid imo, I get that it sucks but I mean we’ll still drop the biggest hammer we can on people fucking about in our space, that hammer will just change.)
---
Yes, now anyone can spam cheap cynoships to move their forces.
---
I mean like if trigs would disable the gates so you have to have caps blops to fight/mine there that would be awesome
---
Titans are cheapest ships? You make no sense, unsurprisingly.
---
This is some prime quality salt right here. Just reading this made my kidneys shrivel up a little.
---
Both means less active players which means that MAU/DAU being higher is a lie. But ye, lets applaud the people in power that lie to us.
---
They're expensive as fuck, and it's really going to stifle nullsec even more because it's going to be that much more difficult to deploy with caps
---
No Other PvP MMOs I can think of has an "overview" a list of the stuff near you, you have to tab or click target.
---
can I have your stuff?
---
I wouldn't call it a nerf. More like removing it completely from the game.
---
Its strange, people have been saying PvP is up this entire time........
---
This makes up a large portion of revenue by now. There is no allowed age of chaos on revenue.
---
And how is it more useful than any other Blackops again?
---
Well no more of that. You may play with yourself though, nobody is against that.
---
and it's still a random correlation. There is no other capital because the cap umbrella is too effective.
---
&gt;What? No you dumbass, I'm implying a lack of dread bombs = lack of titan deaths.
---
You are not implying it. You are using a random correlation, which can be be interpreted however you want equally, in this particular to enforce the argument that you use that correlation against.
---
Your random correlation is just shitty argument, you fartfuck.
---
I've not always been a bloc player, but it's simple mechanics. If it's going to be a PITA to deploy a large super force, you're not going to do it nearly as much. You're going to sit home and defend the more vulnerable krabs. cap escalation will by and large not be a thing.
---
What does less isk have to do with anything? Less people playing that actually have useful characters is a problem. I have so much isk I don't care what happens with crabs. Why does it always devolve into a discussion about salty krabs this and that? Nerf krabs, ok how does that affect me, I don't krab. Well turns out it sure does affect me when less and less veteran good players who dont fly just a condor are playing the game. It affects my gameplay when people quit. 
---
Everyone is so fucking fixated on people doing pve as being the problem with eve. Well shit, they need isk to pvp or I can't fight them. If they quit because it's not worth it to them that more empty systems for me to find a fight, it's less worthwhile ships to fight. 
---
I'm not into ganking defenceless shitheads that won't ever reach beyond 100m/s and my shields won't go below 95% before they die.
---
Do you have any idea how fun this game was back in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007? It will never be that good again. 
---
There's too many liberal sissyboys crying out to CCP on reddit today for any hope of fixing real problems in this game, like delve rorqual spam, citadel timers, fozzie sov, cloak mechanics. The real obvious cancer in the game, instead everyone is fixated on this pvp vs krab mentality. 
---
Bunch of retards
---
What did he say? You have me curious.
---
Agreed on the first, but considering that I make my isk ratting in a NS alliance you couldn't be more wrong about the second. But instead of complaining I'm thinking on ways to adapt to the new incoming changes... small price to pay for what I think is a healthy change for the game.
---
More on that, my alt finished training into a Super a week before the Blackout... shit happens, deal with it and move on.
---
And the rapier will be pooping out titans once it decloaks ...
---
You can't remove Skill extracting. How else will I run 10 Domi accounts for free
---
Oh no no, see when we do work together, the masses froth at the mouth that too many are working together
---
Hey you are arguing against a guy whose saying "dont move stuff around or use a DST". In null. I wouldnt even bother.
---
Implement fozziesov in wh space, limit spawning of new wormholes based on adm
---
I can undersant thaht i mean waht you wanna do aginst the Bomber fleets ?i can im often Just following our Intel serching for PvP in my manticore pepole woud Report me in Intel If they woud See me but nothing 20-30 jumps Nobody even Sees me so waht are you going to do If 20 Bombers Standing next to your rogqual lighting Up cynos and getting supers in even camping the Gates is Not helping cose Somebody coud yust Lock in an alt in your system
---
Remove nullification for t3 cruisers
---
While we are at it: Nerf multiboxing.  
---
Yes, i know this is a very unpopular opinion, but injectors are only a part of that problem.  
---
If you nerf, or outright remove, injecting, people will still be able to multibox rorqs, cynoalts, barges and the like, it will just take them longer to create the alts.  
---
Though, to be honest, at this point, people already have probably mostly the amount of alts they need and/or they will just buy the needed chars of the then invigorated character bazaar.
---
I'm no physicist but the uneven engine layout and none symmetrical ship design on some ships makes me think they would just spin out of control.
---
something like "why don't CCP remove nullification as part of their age of chaos changes"
---
Sorry your niche gameplay is so impacted, have you tried using mobile cyno inhibitor?
---
Kill cyno. Lock carrier during session change for dead cyno. Kill carrier or pod and take carrier.
---
Or the shit that they nerfed needed it?
---
Tell me all of those things didnt need at least one pass. Rorqs have all but broken Eve. Or did you miss the ~40 bil Titans?
---
Is it possible to light a cyno in wormholes? Does it prevent you from activating the module or is it still possible to have cyno parties?
---
I wouldn't mind a dedicated class of t1 industrials for cyno lighting. Make them light-ish on tank, not super super mobile, and low on fitting.
---
Gamma ray burst ?
---
The number of fish in the pond is declining.
---
I just hope they keep the changes. I don't want them to go away when the time of chaos ends. This latest change to cynos is particularly good
---
Change for the sake of change isnt a good thing. I dunno why people keep thinking this. If you aimlessly change things it only means you have no clue what the issue actually is which means the chances of you using a balanced approach is over before it even started.
---
Any one of these big changes should have been atleast somewhat balanced before release.
---
Please try to nuke a brick tank blops cyno with a FAUX pal sitting at 0 on a keepstar grid. Pretty please.
---
I don't think you're very intelligent, no.
---
ECM Fix wasn't exactly years ago lmao
---
So this changes nothing then if that's already all that was being used.
---
I’d add hics, and maybe introduce a new tanky t2 battleship with very limited or no dps abilities except lighting cynos. 
---
E.g. 3 highslots in total, max 2 gun or missile slots, 1 free slot for cyno. Only bonusses for tank and cyno
---
Crazy Earl and his null corp
---
Strange, I didnt know you had to lose all personal gameplay in a MMO. Wonder why no other MMO ever does this, if this is the definition of them.
---
the poll im talking about is such a small scale its not truely reliable anyway, however its all ive got to go on, and i feel from local talk around me other than a few unhappy loud people, THE people love this.
---

---
False narrative you pvp bot!!
---
The bazaar is traded through game channels, so they can verify you trade the isk for the character.
---
If you go back to real money the verification gets way more tricky. How do you prove that you paid for a character? How do you prevent a charge back on a credit card? It's much easier to just say no real money is allowed.
---
but aren't we all krabs ? somehow we got to pay for our pvp ships
---
The problem isnt frigates and corvettes. The problem is rorquals and faxes lighting them. Caps propagating caps is the issue here really.
---
Ah. got it.
---
I'm not so much bothered by the cloaky lokis. I'd hoped for something more radical.
---
...where the hell are you getting this idea?
---
Also, if that's what you think I want, then how does this change even reduce the cynos?
---
So you dont live there. You just make isk. 
---
You dont train into a super, you train into a carrier.
---
They would be the cheapest ship to fit a cyno.
---
Just like you're complaining about people doing.
---
Nope, only omega accounts. 
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pn66sg/security-update-q1-2019
---
They said it was to do with botting, as l4 courier missions were being abused, but decided to ban all L4 missions, and remove an activity that many alpha's took part in.
---
It's pretty stupid imo. Alphas can't explo well cause they can't cloak, can't PI, and now they can't do anything more than T3 abyss and L3 missions. About only way to make decent isk as an alpha is incursions. And those were nerfed too.
---
It's slightly dissapointing that as a newbro who hasn't even heard of cryo before the news came out, this post seems to be more clear on what the change actually entails than all the serious posts out there.
---
Okay. But still, I liked Injectors as *new* player. And they helped me to get into EVE. And I do not see anything broken with it [but I did not play when there was no Injectors, so maybe it was better]
---
It's and automoderation feature. Users are supposed to flag topics with hamful content. After enough flags topic becomes automatically hidden and is reported to moderators.
---
No it changed in March I think.
---
Before drone changes, people ran anoms in pirate battleships and drakes. Hell i saved up like 1.3b to buy my first machariel (back when pirate battleships werent throw away) to do PVE sites by grinding anoms with an arty mael.
---
Id sit at 100ish km with ungrouped 1400s and just 1 shot all the frigs in the wave and then work on the bigger targets. Back then, rattles or ac machs were preferred. The benefit of the arty mach that i look back on now was if someone warped into my site, they would land 100 from me. Meaning i could warp out or try to pop them if they were dumb and tried to ram.
---
Anyway, the PVE meta and nullbears are so focused on drone boats and maintaining the status quo they arent thinking of alternative ratting options. They feel they all need to sit at 0 or afk orbit for PVE. Then complain they get hunted and die so easily.
---
Lately, even been dabbling in running the unrated DEDs in my nullsec static and theyre quite safe since someone has to probe them to get to you. Just dscan like you live in a WH and its ezpz to avoid getting caught.
---
Current generation of nullbears just want free isk without working for it and want to continue their mostly afk activities without needing to change.
---
I fully agree though, this is CCP turning off the isk faucet that are nullsec anoms and now we wait to see how the nullbears... adapt (heh).
---
Ye I mean like incursions, cyno jam everything and covert can still be used. Would be thunderdome, atleast for a while but thats what expansions are, they are not meant to give eternal content.
---
Mmmm, no. 
---
You aren't understanding
---
Been dying since '03 mate, still not dead ;shrug;
---
Why not?
---
Can you even eject with a lit cyno?
---
If you eject from a ship, you can still board it even if someone else locks it. So the pod must die within the session change timer.
---
Nope.
---
Or make some skills injector immune...anything above the 20 million alphas can access has to be real time trained: caps, cloaks, cynos. Injectors were meant to be for the new guy, why not restrict them to the new guy.
---
You’re clearly not familiar with the TEST way of doing thing. Someone who gets dropped on in our space doesn’t have airtime on comms to cry like a bitch because the FC is filling up comms, often by bitching about having to save their dumb ass, again. And why haven’t you killed that cyno inhib yet?
---
Ho I get what is confusing then : as I see it you were actually answering to yourself.
---
here is how I see it : [https://imgur.com/xTbUxV5](https://imgur.com/xTbUxV5)  
---
BTW I personally love this, but I don't think that in general people love it. Wait and see.
---
That is most likely the reason. And it is a very good reason. T3s can move *a lot* faster not only by skipping bubbles but also in AU/sec. Also defensive bubbles wouldn't be a thing.
---
Yay. Now it is the biggest ehp cyno ship in the game. Rejoice. And then get a falcon because fuck paying over 1b for a cyno lol
---
Marginally more useful than before the planned cyno changes...
---
I'm referring to ccp waiting until injector sale numbers start to drop before making changes. There was only a small number instance I can think of them nerfing something within a few days of a big change happening.
---
Yes but contrast this to not having injectors. Old players are just always ahead by however long they've played and I have to wait for all skills no matter what. How is that better? At least in this new system I can grind to become competent.
---
There's a huge difference between "a needed shakeup" and "retarded ass changes that a 2 year old could see will make the current problems WORSE".
---
CCP seems to only consider the latter, because it doesn't take any dev effort.
---
Member when there were no rorquals, guess the game wasn't alive then.
---
it's not like alpha characters can use cynos anyway....
---
This should not affect anyone.
---
Exactly! 
---
And I was also the proud owner a Machariel back in those days, but I used it to run L4 Missions on the Molden Heat's HS island because I was a carebear.

---
The hunters didn't think that far ahead. It's okay though, they'll always buy skins and parrot reddit.
---
To keep with lore we could do like they did some shit with those sweet red orbs and got like thier own entire region to k space
---
You might notice something that all of the things you listed have something in common: Capital ships.
---
No one is crying about day1 HICs or day1 marauder pilots. The problems start whenever you mention  ability for a fresh Character to sit in a capital ship.
---
Almost like injectors are fine, but capital ships are overtuned for their price. Imagine that.
---
&gt; With what isk?
---
I am not saying for all players, but for me it was isk I earned trading. For some other guy in this thread it was isk he farmed. And for some1 else it'd be isk he got from real money plexint(it'd be most time-efficent, I guess)
---
&gt; thinking you're gonna be able to reach anything with your new bought skills of ships you have no idea on how to fly
---
Never had this idea. My idea usually was "I want to try this ship/skill, but do not want to wait week for it". Never thought that sp would let me dunk people around. Almost everyone around you from day0 tell you that buying expansive ship not gonna make you good at piloting.
---
&gt;If you would've quit the game because
---
Would or would not it happen we'll never know now. But I still think that Injectors helped me to get into EVE.
---
This is only true in the most mega-encounters.  Actually letting your enemy drop first so you can position in relation to his blob can be an advantage right now, as long as the battle isn't so big that dropping will likely crash CCP's shit servers.
---
A cloaked ship never hurt anyone.
---
What are you talking about? You were never never allowed to buy characters with real money.
---
well the issue with the super umbrella is the ship of choice, not that people are defending, you shoot at a cruiser in your subcap you maybe even kill it eventually. a super. not so much in many cases.
---
i currently own at least one of every ship hull tier, from titans to frigates. i love capitals, i love subcap fights, i love using capitals on subcaps. and i love killing caps in subs. i accept my deaths, i hate being DD'd in my subcap. but i deal with it. i know the risks of undocking and the costs of owning  capital is going up. AND?
---
Injectors fixed it though.... Did you read?
---
&gt; "old-players" will have to pay a lot more for same amount of sp then new ones
---
on their mains, sure.
---
That had already been done, I was reaching the skill level to effectively use a Super and thinking of buying one; you understood that, don't be a dick.
---
And not sure what you mean about living there, of course I live there with that character... I interact more with my main's corp but it doesn't mean I don't interact and try to help my alt's alliance.
---
&gt; tyool 2019. Get out you carebear
---
god do you want to just completely emulate all the mouth breathing posts you see non stop on this sub? 
---
have an original thought.
---
did i click reply to myself? xD that was not intentional xD
---
Pretty sure Hilmtard doesn't even know what "capital escalation" means.
---
That makes it even harder for newbros to 'catchup' a bit more. Plus it will never happen since its good money for ccp.
---
nerf yourself idiot
---
If you think there are no solo activities in Eve, then my friend you have been living under a space rock, called spodumain. If you actually want to tackle some harder and more rewarding stuff though, then you gotta buddy up, as in almost every MMO. Mainly the point of playing MMO tbh.
---
&gt; A game can't be balanced with timesinks anyway
---
eve was for over 10 years before injectors were introduced
---
fuck you talking about
---
Under the new rules fewer will complain.  I promise.
---
I am eager to see what happens when they hit the anom  respawn.
---
Oh I agree. But something has to change. 
---
Cynos need work simple as that. As I mentioned it seems a bit heavy handed... I would prefered a no caps just subs with a fitting increase... Idk. 
---
It feels wierd to say that most ships should be able to cyno... But I guess why? Why shouldn't it be reserved for a "special class"
---
Why would they need a source of revenue, they should be doing everything they can to make you buy more (which it kinda looks like) 
---
At the end of the day CCP is a company that only cares about one thing: money.
---
Yes, but the guy you replied to is talking about underground toon selling for money, that's why he's saying he doesn't want it to come back. Before injectors people bought characters for real money as the bazaar was barren and relatively more expensive.
---
I agree but there is clearly an overwhelming PERCEPTION out there that probably prevents new people from trying or sticking with EVE.
---
It is a buff to holding grid.  Smaller groups of competent players are NOT complaining.
---
Injectors are a curse and should have never been introduced. There is no natural progression anymore. Buy what you want to do, even if you are clueless and shouldn't be doing that yet. Had you learned slowly in cheaper ships, with a corp around you teaching you, it would have been a natural progression and you'd be competitive, even in cheap ships vs expensive ships.
---
Hi there.
---
ITT people who have never done what you have telling you to adapt or die lmao
---
Providence tears are the best tears, rc sends its regards
---
Your statement was: 
---
&gt; Then everyone would just fit the cheapest bullshit ship possible and it would be business as usual
---
In response to the idea that may e more than 2 ships could fit cynos...
---
Right?
---
But that doesn't change no matter the cost of those ships.
---
People will always use the cheapest.
---
Whether that's 5m or 5b isk.
---
Your point didn't satisfactorily address ANYTHING being discussed.
---
They are actually
---
Funny part is, they're doing this before they can even judge the effects of their other throw-shit-at-the-wall changes, because most people sub for 3+ months at a time since its cheaper.  There could be an assload of people quitting from their other changes that still show active because their subs haven't gone to renew yet.
---
Because ships in eve are not designed to be "good" out of the box. You have to add modules to make them good. Focusing on doing one thing allows you to do it well. Trying to do a whole bunch of shit means you do everything poorly.
---
Make your ship good at one thing instead of mediocre to bad at multiple things.
---
Ultrawide masterrace!
---
Every time wormholes spawn in a system, the radiation kills everyone in space.
---
Every 72 hours, there is a 30 minute window in which Sansha take over Jita, randomly podding every fifth pilot who enters the system.
---
The Sleepers turn Delve into a pocket of wormhole space. 
---
Ships in null sec pick up space vermin, causing a 15% drop in capacitors. All ships entering empire space from null are required to stop at quarantine stations for decontamination, at 500k isk per cleaning. Ships that don’t stop for decontamination are fired upon by Concord.
---
Space dragons.
---
I'd suggest trying out Exploration. You'll feel so much more free than you do just relying on subcap ratting. You'll get a potentially great income and you'll learn how to navigate in nullsec better.
---
I hope cloaky things are next on the table. More chaos!
---
The incursions are still around stop being bad and get yourself in the best fleet
---
not worth the effort tbh. not in tyool 2019.
---
proofs?
---
The idiots in charge probably forgot Ansiblex  shit exists.
---
Though I fly the same, I disagree a new player should learn to slip gatecamps in the inmicus, get gud in the asteroid and then get crazy in the Helios. He is on the proper path . Battle Helios is the final step
---
Ahh I played that back in 2003, it was cancer.
---
No, a single high sec incursion is around. They nerfed spawns so there's only one in high sec, and the time between them has been getting longer.
---
I'd know, they're my main isk maker right now.
---
This absolutely.this change actually changes nothing.  Cynos work exactly the same you just need a specialised ship.  Fuck me these cry babes need to gtfo.
---
Being able to light a cyno on any shipwas ridiculous cant believe it's taken this long.  In fact it was driver to stop fights due to the cynobait problem.  Good change
---
Less capitals is always good. It increases the worth of a capital ship.  
---
Less miners is always good. It increases the worth of ore that is mined.  
---
When you all cancerous people actually leave the game, it will be a ten times better. We will have much more social MMO, where people do stuff together and actually be on comms and listen. We will have mining ops and ratting ops and logistic ops. We will mine our own ore with defense fleets on grid or rat in PvP fits ready to defend ourselves.  
---
Farmville is this way -&gt;
---
Have fun!
---
That's fucking great
---
....and now a logistic question
---
Why the fuck are CCP dev accounts not immune to beeing flagged.....
---
Awesome kill mate, he forgot to pack null the poor  fellow.
---
Like every old internet game... Doesn't mean it's a problem. New players with low skills aren't a problem. Injectors aren't necessary and should have never been introduced. They are milking new players.
---
Can you link a 300k ehp widow fit?
---
I don't like this change. Non-afk mining in highsec is absolute cancer and in comparison to the mining yield in null its completely negligible in terms of actual mineral volume. So now I can't netflix and mine? Guess I'll just unsub my highsec miners now cuz there is absolutely no point in highsec mining while actually paying attention to the screen for my 20mil/hour.
---
If you don't remove wormhole space, remove d-scan in WHs
---
if you can't afford to drop 150m+ everytime you die, a heron or other faction frig is whats best, people like to sit in sites cloakie.
---
My corp isn't on the flair list yet. :(
---
&gt;Thinking CCP would ever willingly decrease their revenue stream
---
&gt;this fuckin guy
---
Are you serious?  
---
You think it makes no difference if the cheapest option available costs 5m or 500m isk? Maybe not to you, but it does make a difference for the game overall. I have no problem with people using the cheapest option available, but the cheapest option available shouldn't be cheap (as it was previously).  
---
Cyno's should absolutely not be allowed on more ships than the changes are forcing. In my opinion, the changes didn't go far enough. 
---
The only place a cyno ever belonged was on a T2 cruiser. I think they should go a step farther and make a dedicated cyno t2 cruiser, similar to a monitor in that it has extremely limited fitting options, costs a lot both in isk and sp - but is very good at doing one thing - dropping caps.  
---
Caps are supposed to be end game, they are supposed to be used sparingly - and they are supposed to make a real difference when they get dropped.
---
Who are "you guys"?
---
You only need 1 spawn is what I'm saying
---
You already can jump the carrier to the Arazu though.
---
Yeah no one actually enjoys PvE activities.. anyone that does, doesn't actually like eve and just wants to rp space man
---
naw, think about it, its how a drone stays level, plus that thing can spin like a gyro. can apply different force to each thruster on the wheel, would make more sense if it was just an x and the wheel wasn't there tho.
---
You will have an MMO that can't support itself and will shit down, if all the krabs went home.
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/098/097/4db.png
---
Just take a break, and eventually CCP will roll the cyno nerf back to something reasonable.
---
This feels like Phoebe all over again.
---
I play on  account having great fun :D
---
because people have got soft, eve has let a bunch of millenials and weak minded in! xD
---
kids these days also, used to everyone wins fortnite friend mode.
---
im all for new players, but im all for educating new players in the last 2years who joined that no, its not meant to be easy, its meant to be risky and hard, death and fighting. the strong and the weak, and yes, your meant to hate grrr gons
---
well duh?  I haven't played eve in 9 years. I log in to see what's changed and see what ccp is doing. In my humble opinion, eve is doing just want all other games are doing, let people spend money to win a winless game. :)

About?
---
Let's discard the bots in nullsec. Oh, would you look at that, it fell down to %10.
---
well, dread are still that, only now theres so many groups in better equipped fleets, that know how to deal with them. theyre simply less effective. also. everyone and thier sister has a super
---
how is this random? holy shit man I can't even...
---
I guess you can't read.  2 accounts still subbed.
---
Not to a "covert" cyno though.
---
you can still teleport as many nerds as you want anywhere you want with a simple click of button. the mild nerf is that your minimal investment increased to ~200-300m/cyno
---
People complaining about provi tha last day or two. Either they turtle up all the time or they blob like bastards. These things cannot both be true if either is right.
---
&gt;holy shit man I can't even...
---
Make any sense. Agree with you on this one.
---
It won't
---
Yep 5 years was enough. Last time I lost a ship after 2 weeks of grinding for it I almost put my fist through my screen. That's when I quit.
---
1 spawn isn't enough for multiple fleets. 
---
You can't win every contest. If you don't win, it's a waste of your time.
---
&gt; Now just **rich players Inject Recon alts** and keep making isk at current levels, while poor people will struggle even more.  
---
**Rich will become richer, poor will be having even bigger issue** 
---
Welcome to Space Capitalism, just because you can't afford it, doesn't mean that CCP needs to be remove it.
---
There won't be a game to play you total idiot.
---
So I guess if someone already has their super fleet on grid, you automatically just lose?
---
Join a well-functioning (existing) corporation.  Help out with responsibilities.  Work your way up.  Take on more duties. Learn about what makes a successful corporation tick.  Only after doing this should you even consider starting your own corporation.
---
Those words aren't ambiguous. If you need the. Explaining you, find a dictionary.
---
Introduction of **EXTRACTORS** for USD/EUR was the problem!
---
you didn´t have those concerns when people p2w´d their 10 cap, rorqual or super alts. 
---
also if you want to defend your krabs and can´t jump to them: fast moving subcaps are a thing in this game.
---
What you are referring to is actually called: elite pvp
---
A "300k" ehp widow at 0 m/s gonna get alphed by  even a small cap fleet.
---
But I won't, incursion payouts are more than what a vni was generating in raw isk in the same timeframe.
---
I think in this application of caps, it really will be OK. I'm personally not bothered that caps can't light a cyno and instantly win. 
---
I do see issues with guys moving their carriers and losing expensive ships because they're stuck long enough that they'll be easy to pop. Personally I'd like to see them fit on subs with a minute or two spoolup (so gate baiting can be handled) and let recons bonus the spoolup down to zero.
---
You could always get some friends
---
But the Arazu could just pop a regular cyno?
---
Get a corpmate to help you? It's a capital asset, and should be treated as such..
---
so you fly around, spying on fights and picturing ships who and none awares.
---
sounds cool not for me to do. although i did a bit of it when i trained into my first ever t2 (the manticore) and hunted solo from that day on until i couldnt afford to hunt and die in manticores without grinding for isk again xD
---
"my bot got killed by NPC and i'm complaining about it on Reddit"
---
Buy them skill extractors
---
... wait, is this what CCP was after?
---
Of you aren't afk in  a drone boat, pve outside of null is more lucrative. That's the point.
---
Well you broke one of the key rules when playing EVE: Dont undock things you cant afford to lose.
---
No dont go there with that one.  Its complete besides the point..
---
Tbh I don't think I've ever known someone to only have 1 account that owns 1 or more capitals maby new bros who have injected or big daddy wallets
---
you would have to pay for another account anyway, dumbass.
---
Eh wtf so your saying your happy to pay the extra $15 or whatever everyone month JUST to own and jump a ship?
---
&gt; Real pvp is dead and all that remains are cloaky ganks
---
You should try an entosis fleet on either side. They can be a blast. Fast moving and mostly (in my experience) not oppressive numbers. I hate the mechanic but I can't deny it generates fun times.
---
What about lighting a cyno instantly ports you to the perimeter gate in Jita with a -10 sec status.
---
You just have to be a bit faster with jumping to the cyno
---
Yeah, undocking to solo roam through low-sec and null is very niche. But not as niche as wasting 50m on an inhibitor for every single potential engagement anywhere (ignoring the 1m activation time).
---
Fuck you you stupid cunt
---
I am one of those people who falls for all the con's.
---
That is a post about the NERF of Rorqs, and just claims that the CSM warned them (a lot claim that)
---
The fact is, that CSM member already said in TiS that they DID NOT espect that. In fact, their main industrialists claimed, the rorq will never be able to mine with the indi cores online, as noone could save them so fast.
---
stop cyberbullying me.
---
this was not written in anyway like any CCP staff would talk about miners, players or how they view the game. Also theres no 'right'' way to play eve especially in CCP's eyes, and to impersonate and say peolpe are ''improperly playing'' is a huge fail
---
Exactly. This is exactly what CCP is talking about, they want an environment where players still and cooperation of small groups is more important than the omnipotent force of the super umbrella. Earlier this month I remember seeing a group of ships mining in close proximity to another, all with combat drones out and assigned to a tech 3 Destroyer, and that Destroyer was named fuckyour bombs. So clearly it was Defender missile fit. It was a huge pain in the ass to attack and I barely got out alive. That is the power of cooperation.
---
No you
---
All the more reason to scream your head off at it. Have you not seen that video? lol
---
A carrier doesn´t hurt anyone. It´s the fighters it can launch...
---
 This cyno change seems awfully beneficial to people hunting  - END OF TRANSMISSION
---
You've had to pay for a second account to move your cap ships by yourself for like 15 years. Why are you just now starting to cry about it?
---
i want a gong in TIDI fights ! xD but the gong as great as it was, was awful when ratting and large full speed fleet fights lol.. oh the annoyance
---
&gt;market is bought out. Fml
---
Well, I guess I better start printing copies and spool up my inventor again.
---
I mean if you don't want to either shell out extra or get friends you can always try to get your carrier to your destination by gate. Good luck.
---
Truth hurts, doesnt it?
---
You could get a cyno elsewhere in the system...  Sure, it'll appear on overview, but by the time it gets popped you'd be able to get a fleet in.  
---
It definitely does seem like there's advantage to the fleet that is on the field first.
---
Recons are cheaper than a t1 frigate?
---
I agree with you, but I think that your changes are coming.   
---
CCP has grown a nice, clanky set of brass balls lately. They are rolling out change after change that screws the people who rely on all the worst mechanics of the game. They give no fucks about the ree.   
---
I do believe that we will see a mechanic change to injectors, but you have to remember that injectors are a cash flow for them so I don't think they will make any changes without a looot of research.   
---
Injectors are a root problem, but there's a lot more that needs to be fixed as well - cyno's were way up there.   
---
Here's to hoping we see drifters coming back and wiping out structures and dropping on cap fleets.
---
\*PI\* alts
---
Oh they’ve changed it? So if the carrier ejects to get in the recon.. I guess board the carrier as you kill the recon!
---
&gt; **you** didn´t have those concerns when people p2w´d their 10 cap, rorqual or super alts. 
---
well actually if you knew me or looked in my posting history, I'm pretty against super capitals and rorqs even existing. Try to argue on what has been said not what you want me to have said tia
---
I am starting to believe you're just an auto-posting bot programmed to fire off the most aggressive and cringy copypasta shitposts.  
---
Going nuclear immediately and telling everyone around you they are "retarded" and "fucking suck" and their opinions are "shit" is not the best way to win an argument.  It's a fantastic way to look like a completely unhinged neckbeard who takes a video game WAY too fucking serious.  Please tell me more about all your super accounts and how this won't affect you though.  Brag about your super umbrella.  God you're a fucking loser.
---
If all the krabs went home, every pvper will eventually start doing their own mining/ratting/building together. So we will be fine, thank you for your concern.
---
MMORPG.
---
ratting supers? facing different direction, ratting togther in non ditto fits/hulls..... staged! :D nice pic tho
---
No, there won't be a game for you maybe. For us, we will have so much fun. Cry me a river now.
---
can i have your stuff?
---
I could afford it. It was the last straw in a string of straws where I had terrible bad luck losing ships and the time sink wasn't worth it to me at that point anymore. I never felt like the time invested, nor bling on a ship was ever capable of being leveraged. I never felt like I had gained anything other than rage. This game has serious diminishing returns for time invested.
---
Surely each and everyone of us will buy a dozen accounts to keep the money flowing?
---
I miss the era of paying developers money to sell you the best product possible. Giving things away for free just means having to make a game worse to generate the income that should be coming from players just to play the game. I guess one thing it allows is for a game that isn't strong enough to survive on its own monetary value to continue trudging along with compromised gameplay while supporting itself with income from whales. But that's usually not a game I enjoy playing, and it's not the Eve I joined back in the day.
---
My point is you don't HAVE to be able to do it your self. The whole reason for the changes are that moving caps around is too easy and oppressive as hell to everyone except cap blobs.
---
You shouldnt be abusing adderall, its bad for you.
---
no
---
police fleets of these 'must have skin skin installed on ship to join' and the ship dies the skin died with it
---
It reduces the number of cynos because you cant fit them on most ships and the ships that can fit them are expensive.
---
It's the helium in the ice, the tears come out all squeaky sounding.
---
That's not the point
---
That seems unlikely.
---
Its almost like all the fish became whale and swims in nullsec.
---
Not sure yet, but most likely gates or the 5 minute recon cyno and with friends/corp mates
---
yes, a trasher can be tanked to work under gate guns for a second volley.
---
Yea I think ccp will change their decision before patch day. I would have liked to see module fitting changes. Like why not just double or triple the fitting requirement and disallow fitting to capitals.  That would stop "supers on everything", still for cheaper move ships, not require a specific skill path, aaaaand made people gimp fits to their a cyno module on. All while being very very easy to code
---
you can board your own ship that is being targeted
---
CCPlz cloaky mining barge.
---
By now I meant pre-changes
---
grr now i cant dunk dumb rorquals and carrier carebears with my super carrier because cynos need a force recon grr
---
lmao elite
---
yes I get it a tractor unit which you can carry around in your ship's inventory
---
 (also this post will stay up for some time cause there's a suggested location where I should set up shop but I need to check it out 1st and i'm not getting the time and for some bizarre reason the game won't run)
---
I was playing last night till 12 am (I had to ready myself for something) then I come back the next day and double left click on the eve launcher from the desktop and my cursor shows a blue circle around then it goes away but the game doesn't run. Every time I double left click it, right click then open, open as admin or left click then enter, it just doesn't run do you happen to know why?
---
The number of whales in nullsec is declining.  Check the figures.
---
the clearly obvious answer
---
Not everything is about isk/hr (for me at least), there are other things to consider like effort put into it, skills needed, time you have to dedicate to the activity and so on... no at least people will diversify a little more I guess, and it's not like making isk in Null is or will be impossible. Now it will be less profitable and more risky, and I think that was desperately needed.

try warping a pod to a bubbled rorq xD see how that goes. oh please let this be goonswarms best idea
---
Why is facing different direction a problem? One was aligned for warpout, the other warped in and sat. I was watching the Nyx when the Hel warped in.

Fuck me, which early 2000s year have we gone back to?
---
&gt; Likes saving up for big shiny toys.If ccp takes everything away so you can only take it out once in a blue moon and lose it when you maybe take a small vacation than people will stop playing, turn alpha or downsize their amount of accounts.
---
First, I don't disagree a lot of people have stopped logging in their ratting alts but many were alphas running VNIs so no bottom line damage, there.
---
The thing is, We didn't always have anoms for grinding 100+ mil an hour and there were still people dropping isk on shiny stuff. They weren't as many in use as today but a reduction in their use is, to me, a good thing. There should be a chicken in every pot but not a cap in every hangar.
---
So if my income goes down in the same proportion as most others, in theory I'll see more opportunities to engage someone who is also flying something less pricey. You see, these changes might lead to good times. Give it six months.
---
y-y-you mean... stay logged in beyond killing the daily rat? Uegh
---
That’s how Wh’s work.  Null is not a WH. Yes being on comms and listening to the spurge is great fun.  If you do not have matching hours to the rest of the people in your Corp I guess you are sol then?  The hyper krabs already die every day.  The people who do rat tanked for a fight will still not undock.  Why would I risk billions of isk when the reward did not scale?  All the advantages are given to the cloaky guys. There is no counter play for this besides having a 2nd pilot there that will get alpha’Ed off the field before any help can get jumped in.  Then what, we should die quietly?   Yes ore and salvage will get more profitable but there will not be anything on the market when no one is able to gather it. I know there will be some that get out to get the ore but they most likely will not sell outside of their alliance.  Then you 80mil bombers will start costing 250 mil if not more as resources dry up.  So I hope you have a bit of fun watching the great swirly CCP is giving it’s self.
---
Lol. The sentence "change to subcaps" is the reasom this is happening.
---
It makes it so the "terrain" of a fight matters more. Since enemy forces may have to warp in.
---
&gt;"why did X get to inject all that SP a month ago and now I can't?"
---
And the answer will be that it was breaking the game.
---
So according to Eve Industry, the cost to build it is approximately $348,641,000. 
---
Right now there are two on the market in Jita, with the lowest at $700M.  "Profit" is about $339,639,300 or so.  But that assumes it will sell at that level.  You could list it for $100-150M and that wouldn't be unreasonable, since the buyer still makes a hefty profit.  
---
But in this case, given the fact the last sale of the finished item(s) was in January, you're probably better off unloading it within alliance sooner.

this comment right here is the single best meme in this thread.

"why shouldn't I get to ruin your fun?"
---
well. im not shitting on you man, its a nice pick, im just being in internet mode but,
---
the nyx is being shot by somthing, suggesting it is being shot by the Hls fighters, or morelikely the rats still out, if theres rats still out in the nyx's site why is his fighters currently burning back to him to 'dock' into the nyx.
---
Get rid of HS, LS, and WH.   Make all of Eve nullsec.   That'll stir things up.   
---
You did say 'chaos', right?
---
Sure, but whining is easier than thinking.
---
Yeah, and ratting in anything but a drone boat is the same effort for less isk.
---
That would be cool too... infact I prefer your version of the idea as I am always in favor of more drugs :)
---
Safe
---
Yep! I get occaisonal kills as the opportunity arises, mostly just wandering around right now. Have to look at what current wars are going on and try and get some big fleet fights.
---
Of course you're right.  Eve shouldn't have gates and all ships should "warp" themselves to their destination system, same or similar to the way Elite Dangerous does it.
---
Unfortunately CCP are have no idea how to design a game, especially a space game.  Eve was a success by chance really.

this is some cringy shit
---
whats the difference to before the change?
---
Let me introduce you to a term called "money maker" - look up how to get extractors at the start of the chain
---
its art like this, and videos if you grab them that get used in adverts n stuff i think :D
---
I am really happy to see these ballsy changes. Will be resubbing the moment the patch is up.
---
That has been true since capitals were introduced... why are you raging so hard now?
---
Which is 1/5th the EHP of a meta fit active dread that costs half as much.
---
&gt; they unsubbed ages ago
---
5 accounts subbed, about 2 months left, won't be resubbing.  Eve is shit.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cqn4l7/wts_erebus_bpo/
---
I didn't see any in this thread and that's not a thing on Discourse.
---
That is the point... You are just butthurt that your big shitty boat requires some dedication to use now. 
---
I already have a second account and would not have a problem using that to cyno shit around.
---
Dude i dont want to be mean but if you bling your ship and it doesnt make difference then it was ether shitfit to begin with, bad piloting or (most likely) combination of both. Ignorance causes ship losses not luck. Need to jump gate but dont know what is on the other side -&gt; scout it first, need to rat but unsure if its safe? -&gt; try to rat in something not so pricey and see what happens.
---
&gt;Falling PLEX price means that people that buy PLEX from CCP will make less ingame isk.
---
Also means more players can afford plex.
---
It is being shot by Angels if I remember right. If have to look at other pics to remember. I don't know why the fighters came back, they did a few times though. With my overview off I couldn't see if there were rats right on him.
---
Lol what a loser
---
Doesn’t attacking High sec space result in Concord completely fucking you?
---
Maybe you should have joined a decent corp that could show you how to use that ship correctly, rather than mindlessly whelping it left and right?
---
Well, your name certainly checks out.
---
Having content dropped at your feet must suck.
---
you should sort it by new too
---
incursions were nerfed?
---
&gt;We are null sec, hear us *whine"
---
well we still fight around rorqs, fighting the response/actually killing it only ones we don't fight are those who have a cyno up before the cyno inhib goes up, so idk what to say
---
yea i had to go back to my PC for that, idk how to do that on mobile. Should be done now.
---
lmao you started it with "you give the internet cancer" and then I respond with similar attitude and now you're crying like the baby back bitch SJW you are lmfao get the fuck off the internet nerd.
---
Didn't mittens already declare war on HS?
---
Since those posts continue today, obviously that perception still exists in the post-injector world though.
---
It's my opinion that they are looking at removing skill injectors. Look at what's going on now with the Season of Skills. CCP needs to supplement the skills in some way if they remove injectors. 
---
I think the better option is to let us remap skills every 6 months or so. But I agree injectors need to go. Keep extractors as a way of remapping skills, and only specific to that character. 
---
Also I'd keep the daily alpha injectors.
---
I prefer ratting in them over C3s.
---
They are a bit less isk/hour, but the sites and system have a lot more isk overall. So you spend a lot less time scanning down all the sigs.
---
more like hear me cringe post
---
They changed so there's only a single spawn in high sec, and there's a longer time between spawns, the last one was well over the 36 hours that's the usual max.
---
The fact that I'm not 100% sure they won't do that is a problem.
---
I love tears but, if you are a miner why is it so hard to skill into a prospect? Also this a very considerable buff to jump freighting.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
&gt;No one is crying about day1 HICs or day1 marauder pilots or day 1 leshak pilots or day 1 blopses.
---
No crying, but those are not "newbro"-ships and should arguably not be injectable.
---
This makes sense , i agree with this .
---
Without a hard cyno? Really guy?
---
You can \*cheap\* fit a falcon to be 100% neut proof with &gt;72k EHP, and &gt;300dps passive regen \*in it's resist hole\*.
---
Also - it's covops cloak. So, position it - uncloak, cyno up - dreads land.
---
Pretty brave posting.
---
Ok crybaby..
---
Just an endless gift of cringy posting you are.  In this recent example we have:
---
1. "You started it."
---
2. The usual cringy alt-right "SJW" labeling
---
3. Calling me a bitch
---
4. Zero punctuation
---
5. Using "nerd" to insult someone who plays the same nerdy game you do
---
6. Refusal to recognize capitalization. 
---
It's just a glorious post all around.  If I were to try and explain to someone what a raging neckbeard sounds like, but I couldn't say "reeeeee," I would just show them this.  Please keep it coming.  Post more.  Tell us more conspiracy theories about CCP, while you also admit you have 15 accounts.  I'm here all day, and I'm happy to keep laughing at you.
---
Lol no!!
---
That was the point YOU were making.
---
My God dude, follow along.
---
If the fact people will always pick the cheapest is the issue, how do you propose to solve that?
---
Because I was never once saying we need cheaper cyno ships.
---
So you're not interested in discussion, I see.
---
Keep insulting people, I'm sure your ISK will make up for your lack of friends...
---
Yes...so then we agree?
---
Never once did I say anything that suggested that wasn't the case at all
---
Where should I settle a new group? When creating a base what is an ideal place to put it for a new pvp group. I was thinking we could be like high sec mercenaries but I question the profitability of the process. I’ve also been told that low sec may have some more valuable goods but If we were in low sec we probably couldn’t be mercenaries just because I think demand would be low. Don’t really want to be pirates because that hurts my security status. Any ideas?
---
Benefit to wormholes? Lol we fly caps too, when we get rolled out after a big brawl we gotta move them fuckers back home. Those recons that are going to get popped are going to cost money. Believe me we are feeling it too.
---
Absolutely.  And capital fleets aren't exactly the most maneuverable in that way.
---
I would second this, and recommend the Eve Uni Wiki generally.  The fits aren't always optimal for everything, but they are fundamentally sound and will provide a great first step.
---
By what caps? It can be lit at 500m/s for now, by the time fax lands it will still be moving and not tracked by any anticap dreads.
---
Unless they have 10 haw dreads in range of the cyno, it's not likely.
---
We just know how the game was before injectors and how they really changed the game, a lot of players (me included) say for the worse. Overnight, you could inject into into rorqs, caps or supers as long as you had the ISK (and if you can afford a super, you can afford to get a lot of injectors). You couldn't buy 10+ Rorq alts because they just wasn't that many Rorqs characters available. 
---
Caps+ were balanced because they were rare. You couldn't protect your miners/ratters all that much, nothing compared to the super umbrellas of today. There were roaming fleets of subcaps and nullsec was primarily a pvp area, although there obviously was ratting and mining, it wasn't a predominantly ratting paradise that it was a short 2 months ago. Casual pvers were in hisec (CODE was actually pretty big because of that, a lot of targets to choose from). It's not like hisec income is all that bad, you can easily make more than VNI ratting within a few months (L4 missions or incursions)
---
It also increased the number of alts anybody could have. With Skillfarming, you can have a virtually limitless amount of alts. Your patience is the real limiter. All you need is to train an alpha to 5mil skillpoints (roughly 3 months), or pay 10 bil for the 10 injectors to get him there and you can get them to omega permanently. If you wanted to mine with 10 miners, you actually had to pay 150$/month to keep them omega. Some people did it, but it was more expensive than what most people were willing to put in. I personally know people now with 40+ alts and there are some (like Omega Gold) with 100s of alts used to seed every system in Delve. This just wasn't possible back then.
---
Injectors also made the price of PLEX soar up and double in price in year or 2, as a lot of people started buying PLEX for their skill farms. Back then, you could actually afford to play for free if you wanted. You could farm incursions for 10 hours (say, the whole day Saturday, or a combination of Sat + Sun) and pay for the PLEX in ISK. Not everybody did it, of course, most payed their monthly sub, but it was a lot more feasible.
---
Plus, a lot of newbros say this is a catch-up mechanic, which is partly true, but it also has widened the gap in-between a newbro and an experienced player. Experienced players have a lot more ISK and a lot more alts. They jumped much further than any newbro can ever catch up. An experienced player might have had 1 main and an ok alt and an alt they were training up. Overnight, they had 3 chars equivalent to their main. They could make a lot more ISK, a lot more quickly, which means more injectors, more alts and better ships, which means they continue going on much faster than a newbro. Instead of catching up to a player with 20-30 mil skillpoints, you are now catching up with one with 40-50 mil skillpoints, on multiple alts, that is always increasing faster than you can.
---
Injectors are also now a much further goal to achieve for a newbro than what were the typical goals back then. Instead of grinding for hours to get that single injector worth 1bil, you grinded for ships in a typically increasing order of price. By the time you got to a battleship and were ready to get some ships to T2, you were making enough ISK to replace your battleship by grinding missions for 3-4 hours. You could spend a long time piloting ships worth 300mil at most and by the time you made goals worth 1bil+ (such as caps or T2 battleships), you were a seasoned player who had been in all areas of space and experienced a lot of what Eve had to offer. In a way, this game was a lot less grindy back then.
---
Very well said, i voted for you btw, better luck next time.
---
&gt;I think the list is too restrictive, but definitely having more dedicated cyno ships is good.
---
Is the list not the list of ships?
---
Twitch?
---
You do realize that pvpers have pve alts right?
---
Ease of access. Compared to fresh out of lvl4 newbie eyes, anoms are great. Not everyone min/max's the highest potential tick at any given moment or even knows the best method as a newer player. In small groups (when i lived in null) id run anoms as described above, not because they were the best isk/hour activity, but because that was "my" space with my friends/corpies. I could login, undock, kill some rats and watch for fights through corp chat/intel. When i saw a roaming ship, id go dock, reship and go try to get a fight.
---
Sure, you could have your highsec incursion alt making isk and still go pvp on another alt, but not everyone plays that way, and it being a game, is more immersive with one character to some.
---
The basis is that even a 100man fleet has trouble killing a super before the roflcopter arrives.
---
I disagree and I like injectors, they should stay ( maybe restrict some skills though)
---
Glad you came here to post this.  Bye Felicia.
---
Y'all don't have ~~phones~~ force recons?
---
Cynos mean dick-all now and caps clearly are on their way out so what’s the fucking point I those skills too. They already limit injects for anyone over 5mil sp. people are just willing to spend the money
---
you want big prey, spend a little isk
---
The thread is very well written. I agree that Nullsec has become safer than Highsec.
---
Who cares? lol
---
&gt; The last few years nullsec has become safer then highsec
---
Nullsec has always been safe provided you knew what you were doing, if you responded appropriately you were pretty safe. Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is lying to themselves.
---
&gt; If you really don't feel like this game is for you then stop posting about it and just move on.
---
Maybe you should embrace the change and not fight it that people still have an interest in EVE instead of trying to control the narrative? Don't fight it, EVE is currently a slow-mo car crash in progress.
---
Since when are cloaky ships with cynos used to drop content, they are used to be perfectly safe untill you find something you can safely drop on, kill the target, cloak up and wait till you can away in perfect safety.
---
That´s not even a fight...you can´t be any safer than that (undocked).
---
&gt;  if you dropped other sub caps, you were using HACs or trig ships which now will be replaced by bombers or T3Cs.
---
are you having trouble reading?
---
I think I missed the memo, what are they changing with Cynos?
---
Your mind couldn't afford it.
---
Solo mining and operating works with the timeframe I have to play. Not much blue going on in Provi during AUTZ. Honestly, some days the population of Provi at that time is mostly Tickl and/or HTC/PHEW/CUNT members. I honestly like that. Mining would be the most boring job ever without those guys dropping by to make life exciting every now and them. And I was ok with my place in the equation. My job was to harvest resources without getting killed, their job was to make me less than successful at that. I could always get away with enough to offset the losses I sustained. It was a good balance for me. Now, I can't even mine enough to build a new mining barge before the one I'm in gets toasted. So I switched to buying minerals and JFing them in.
---
But you are right, I should just rearrange my life schedule, become an elite PVPer and start playing a game that is totally different than what I have been enjoying for 3 years.
---
If you value your income  high enough to ramble about it everyday on reddit, and you have better experience generating said isk outside null, go for it. Leave null and generate your isk. 
---
Or were you telling us, you want sizeable isk rewards while being afk?
---
You can't warp supers and Titans into fights.
---
It takes ages to get everyone aligned, and that has more to do with bumping then player skill.
---
They are too easy to bubble, either before warping, or by drag/catch bubbles
---
You still want hard cynos available with the fleet to bring in replacements, because you're going to bubble fuck yourselves to catch disconnects.
---
Really, I feel like at the absolute minimum, CCP should fix bumping before the nerf cynos this hard.  The reason every Titan fits a cyno now is in case you get bumped off the main fleet either during the jump in, or coming out of warp, and you get caught.
---
Agreed, although none are Eve either!
---
Combat pilots more often have cyno 5 trained for hunting people like you. You should try being less useless and dependent in space and learn to do things yourself.
---
So you think it is ok that in order to move your 2bil carrier you should have use a 2.5bil blops?
---
The game needs more players not less.
---
Yes please, the more bombers are used, the fast we can get them nerfed cause holy fuck is it a broken ship
---
I thought this was a troll until I realized he’s actually using his real reddit account.
---
You can't warp in.  If you somehow manage to get aligned without bumping off each other, there is a 100% chance you get caught in defensive bubbles and die horribly trying to warp a super fleet to a fight.
---
I guess re-read? I specifically said that picking the cheapest is \*not\* an issue. 
---
You said we need a larger variety of cyno ships. I disagree, should be a smaller list.
---
Not really. Cause if prices on everything else goes up your purchasing power might not increase. In general falling PLEX prices isnt good. It could have been balanced since a large driver is SP (CCP could have done more login events).
---
I would, except Farmville doesn't have adversity. I loved the adversity of mining in Eve. It's not for the weak, but it can be overcome. Or it could be and I am sure it still can be overcome, but I'd need a bigger blue donut to do it.
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
That doesn't actually work like that.  There is a reason everyone brings in supers to a hard cyno.
---
You can put prospects that can cyno for a recon to help you
---
Injectors inflicted lethal damage to the game in my opinion, basically everyone I knew as well as myself stopped playing shortly after injectors introduction.
---
it was irony.
---
Impass is not in Dronelands
---
Dude, Im not gonna go through everything just to show you. Belive what you want. And not expecting such a massive increase doesnt mean they didnt realise it was OP. They just didnt know the extent.
---
When we do use team work, you all bitch to high heaven because there are too many of us. Get off you high horse dildo and shut the fuck up
---
I to think it's BS the way CCP does game design to force you into having to use more than one account. Personally I think CCP should allow you to simultaneously login all 3 characters on your account (also think at the same time they should limit multibox to 3 only, can't balance game with unlimited multiboxing but thats another issue). That way you have a single account, single training queue, but access to do some self scouting and cynoing. 
---
I will say though, that once you have the skills training up on another account, you just convert the account over to a skill farm and it pays for itself. However, that is the current situation, there's no guarentee that the account will continue to pay for itself in the future, as it's based upon market pricing that can change.
---
Everyone I talk to gets so fixated on the ratting experience, when the real issue with this is the severe and dangerous impact this can have on capital escalations in wars. 
---
I suspect that removing a null bloc from their space with offensive uses of supercapitals will become close to impossible.
---
You had to have it before to cyno around. You got ruse cruised.
---
OK, the safeword is: "ihub upgrade"
---
&gt; this makes ccp a lot of money
---
Failing games make even less money.
---
Just google it, there’s only been one fight of note with PL in in that system. This has been fun, trailing over a couple of days but I feel, and correct me if I’m wrong, but we are never going to agree or even agree to disagree. So I’ve remained civil but I just don’t care anymore. Good luck in Eve, fly safe and see you around.
---
Bots are no way close to being that many. But sure.
---
I have to appologize.
---
I blocked that person because he is a complete dick. So it appeared to me you were answering to a complete correct post, which actually was yours, with a strawman and nitpicking.
---
Again, my apologize, sorry for the time waste.
---
ooooh nooooo
---
Congrats on being someone who just told CODE you take them seriously.
---
If you say so, then Titan bridge is it's thing and it also needs to be terrible in every other way.
---
Hello bridging titan to the lossmail generator and doing home defense in subcaps. This is actually gonna be fun when a rorqual gets tackled.
---
Adapt or die carebears!
---
then don't sit in cloaked fleet. In blackout no one knows if there's really a cloaked fleet. Be smart
---
Yeah and how effective is 72k EHP when the ship shooting it is a cap gun dread?
---
Because any ship lighting a cyno will be moving 0 m/s, so prepare to get volleyed off field.
---
Bombers don’t use bombs to kill people. They use torps and you can’t just defender missile those. We don’t have small roaming gangs, we have 100-200 bombers show up and annihilate what they want. Best options is supers or harpies and even then, the bombers just warp out
---
Is EVE even a game that you can play though? You kind of click this, click that, it's like browsing the web but the screen shows you a different picture each time.
---
To be fair, my orca has minimal shield tank (it is hull-tanked to ward against ganking) and the trigs hadn't broken my shields. I doubt they could have chewed through me in under an hour at the rate they were going.
---
Yes, thats why this change is good.
---
This is correct. There were bad things about incursions but nerfing them is a very weird choice. If they really wanted to lower isk created they could have cut bounties by half and kept spawns, so all the noobs can have the experience of flying in a fleet.
---
well that was clear, thank you anyway
---
Combine these annoying op high sec scouts with the NPC mining fleets absorbing asteroids, this game is asking to be abandoned.
---
&gt; "old-players" will have to pay a lot more for same amount of sp then new ones.
---
No they don't.  The SP cliff only applies if you are injecting on a high SP character.  Everyone has low SP alts they can spec into new stuff without running into the really bad SP losses.
---
IMO it's more like browsing your spreadsheets but … well, I understand your point :D
---
This has been an issue since Plex was introduced into the game. The P2W ball was already rolling, I gave it a pass because it allowed them to give people RMTing for isk a legal (and profitable) window for CCP to make money without hitting the black market. 
---
Injectors caused a major problem in the game; and the cat is already out of the bag. Thing that didn't used to be a massive problem, (aside from early days PL super blobs) was because to fly (properly) a super it took YEARS. I've personally known 3 pilots that passed before ever getting to fly a character coffin. o7
---
The issue with botting and plex and injectors has been a bukkake fest of rinse and repeat. Ban a bot, they replex a new toon, inject to ratting levels, restart botting program using new toon and a new proxy/ip/vm. 
---
Things that didn't used to be an issue (like everyone and their mother in atleast a cap, most supercaps) because of skill injectors. Where as balance has become impossible; there will always be an optimal build and optimal meta. 
---
Rorq's a great example, Everyone just skill injected into them. Then nerf nerf nerf out of existence. Surprised Muninn's are still standing tbh (sry elo) 
---
Every new meta/optimal blob doctrine people just inject into; we've got to the point of where the SP creep in eve (the 1 mil + sp give aways and the  4.99 for another mil SP packs being monitised don't help) 
---
Where there's not a ship type the majority of null players can't fly (or almost fly) within a week or 2. 
---
So we end up at everything nerf'd. Took one of the grindiest mmo's currently alive and just made it not fun to play. I mean pvp is always a cornerstone of eve, but if your running abyssal's in empire all day to fund said habit and not go isk negative. The game just loses it's appeal.
---
Now cynos? Every major fight.. BR- you name it.. started and happened because of cynos. 
---
&lt;Golf clap&gt; Good job ccp.
---
&lt;rant off&gt;
---
If you had to grind two weeks for it, you couldn't afford undocking it.
---
&gt;The majority of eves player base likes pve activities  
---
no, the majority does them because it's necessary
---
Yes!! I love it.
---
They killed me in an active tanked skiff after killing all my combat drones as well as a few afk orcas that were in the belt with me but not my own.
---
Injectors might've been what popped up the issue but they are not the issue themselves. Shitty Mechanics and bad balancing is the problem. Injectors only makes it possible to skill into unbalanced ships faster.
---
From the perspective of someone who've fairly new to the game, without injectors I would not be playing. If there were no way for me to catch up or to boost my skill speed I would've quit this game for the third time.  
---
First time I loved the game for a week, then I realized that I needed to spend months to just get the learning skills and after a few more weeks I just quit the game. I kept my subscription on for a year afterwards just so I could get skills and one day, maybe be able to play the game on a somewhat equal footing.  
---
I came back a few years later together with some friends and we had plans on creating a home in wormholes but alas my friends left the game because they now discovered that they needed months of skills before we could do anything and Highsec missions are boring af.  
---
Third time I came back, now with injectors in the game. I joined Karmafleet and now, only thanks to injectors can I actually join the new friends I've made when they do things. My skills are still not perfect for what I'm doing but they're at least good enough that I can be more than an anchor dragging them down.   
---
I might add that this is all just sub-battleship stuff.
---
So, a group other than CODE, then?
---
That 2nd idea I think would be pretty neat.
---
I'm not complaining about Provi? I fly with them.
---
Well, the other option is to light the cyno out of range of the enemy super fleet and use your warp drive.
---
&gt; Basically what you wanted was to be all alone, never work with any other players, but then immediately be able to summon all the titan in the Galaxy to defend you if you got attacked?
---
You are only partially right. More like I don't mind working alone and I accepted that would get me killed sometimes. I'd never mobilize a fleet just to save a disposable mining barge. Maybe and Orca if the fleet was next door and bored.
---
Or multibox.
---
If plex is cheaper, more players cannot afford it?
---
&gt;Cause if prices on everything else goes up your purchasing power might not increase. 
---
Why would this happen?
---
&gt;In general falling PLEX prices isnt good. 
---
It's extremely good and necessary for the health of the game.
---
But why you mine in highsec?
---
I want to live in this timeline.
---
You can also use a recon which is considerably cheaper than a BLOPs battleship. Also, with a much higher demand for BLOPs battleships and them not being a niche anymore, we may see those prices drop some as production catches up.
---
Quit or quit not. There is no cry.
---
Yesterday i was very hurt as a tanked procurer (60k life) and was mocked in forums by strange people calling me bad player and they say was impossible 1 ship do that. I dont die but were 5/6 and relatively for luck. Unsubbing mining and industrial accounts.
---
Tinfoil hat : Some times ago somone say in the forum of Everquest the theory than many MMO company websites have his own private accounts to troll valid concerns.  Then many times the vocal minority who approve achangte, are pippet accounts related with the mmo developer, in that case. maybe happen in other games.
---
Botting in nullsec is already at near 0 thanks to blackout.
---
Also CCP: we dont fuck with our money. 
---
Im willing to estimate that over 1 million plex a day is spent on extractors or injectors. On average.
---
Wait, we can do T3 Abyss?
---
I was having so much trouble getting a T2 Abyss-fit Thorax to work that I ditched it and took advice from an alliancemate to skill into Worms for T2 missions.
---
Got any advice on doing the Abyss as an Alpha?
---
No ur not
---
yes
---
You sound like you’re just a shitty pilot. You don’t understand how to usefully bling a ship vs mindlessly fit MOD BLUE MOD GOOD. You nerdrage and quit instead of understanding what you did wrong. 
---
I’m pretty sure eve rewards time investment more than any other game out there, but you have to actually be developing skill during that time, not just feeding cluelessly.
---
The cats already out of the bag though.
---
To restrict them now would further entrench those that were positioned to take advantage of them at that time.
---
&gt; CCP needs to supplement the skills in some way if they remove injectors.
---
They already did that before implementing injectors.  Learning implants and remaps let you augment your training rate for years without injectors in the game.  Properly used they would make up about 3 months of training every year.
---
&gt;endless salt
---
Retard alert.
---
Thanks! The first video was really interesting. Looking forward to watching this one.
---
Oh, well that is good to know (and a bit worrying....)
---
Its easy to know 2 people i would hope so.
---
AFK playstyles will disappear, I guess. I think, that's a good thing.
---
&gt; make the gap to catch up
---
Why the fuck are you trying to "catch up"?  That's a stupid meta to invest in, it literally serves no fucking purpose and is arguably LESS useful than splitting that same amount of SP between multiple accounts.
---
&gt; Expansions are free
---
Strange, my bank account indicates that I've been paying 15-20 dollars per month for this free thing.
---
&gt;  *If I were to try and explain to someone what a raging neckbeard sounds like,*  *but I couldn't say "reeeeee," I would just show them this.* 
---
Well at least we can agree your posting is a grade-A choice cut example of what happens when sperg, over-confidence, buttmad and being terrible at a spaceship game all combine to form a single solitary turd with a keyboard.
---
&gt;By what caps?
---
Carriers, supers, once it hits zero velocity (which happens pretty fast due to the mass addition), bomb dreads.  Capital ships apply to battleships pretty well, especially when your trying to light a cyno in the middle of a couple of hundred of them.
---
The Fax isn't going to matter, because your in cyno is going to get alphaed, just like it does now.  Two Faxs is all that's going to make it through.
---
The meta might adapt, but I don't see the point.  Getting a super fleet on grid is already really hard, and just not having a nullified cyno ship is already a pretty big nerf that I guess is an OK trade off.
---
My point is fleet fights are not broke in any way, and are already rare as fuck.  Personally, I think this change ends them until CCP comes up with a more reasonable change, which is inevitable.
---
As opposed to the rich having a cyno on everything and able to bring backup the second anything is threatened...?
---
NPC mining fleets do not mine moon belts. Just saying.
---
I do this all the time. Just make sure you have a few hours in case RNG Jesus keeps throwing ya deeper into the unknown.
---
depends on the player tbh
---
That's pretty much already present outside of null.
---
Null only offered convenience and the ability to do it almost entirely afk.

This is Just something I threw together quick and its pretty viable if you want a hard cyno bad enough. There are possibilities it there. This just needs dedicated faxs, for big groups that's no big deal

Dropping large amounts of end-game ships now requires \*gasp\* planning, coordination, and isk!  
---
Brave might have some issues with two of those things, but hey - you're newbros right? You have no business using end-game ships if you can't figure out how.
---
probably, thats when shit started going down hill lol. "Theres too many supers!!" Well maybe because you let people buy skill points....
---
Well my hope is that a generation of spoiled and coddled nullsec residents will adapt or cycle out and be replaced with people who embrace PVP as a part of life in the lawless area of EVE. And if we're real lucky we'll get some people there who play for more than just injecting another titan alt and who aren't afraid to lose some ships to learn from their mistakes, like we all did. And maybe once they figure out how to fly subcaps they'll see that they don't need to be farming 300 mil an hour for weeks on end to take part in PVP, or anything else for that matter. That this whole arms race into capitals was the biggest cash grab ever by CCP, to the detriment of everything else in the game, and that we're not done with the changes needed to reign in the negligent fuckup that the past 3 years have been.
---
But failing all that maybe we'll just move into null ourselves and shoot each other. My standings list has zero blues in it.
---
I personally think there are better ways around this. Like .. putting the red timer on the jump on the cyno in? _(3 minutes red timer = 3 mins spool up on cyno before you can jump) I think the sub cap bridging thing was just fine imho
---
Oh removing it off of literally every ship is a great idea. What isn’t a good idea is only allowing it on 500mil ships without having a cut down on the timer. Someone was sipping the hooch
---
A lot of those kills were hunters killing pveers and nearly all pveers have moved to hisec, as instructed by Provi leadership. Fewer ships kills, but a lot more of these kills are pvper vs pvper.
---
The issue Im seeing isnt cynos. Its actually not any of the individual changes themselves. They are overly broken and so on and I doubt CCP will actually iterate on them in any realistic timeframe but still.
---
I have 3 issues with the changes as a whole, 1: they very much seem to just attack 1 playstyle. 2: from what Im seeing none of these changes will actually create any real changes, its just surface changes. And 3: Whilst all of these changes are ongoing, which is around 18 months according to Hilmar in the pod, other things wont change. And this is my biggest issue, all the things that currently are broken wont get fixed.
---
HS wont get better meaning retention will go down since it was NS that did the recruiting and kept most of the new players in the game. Which they no longer can since subcap ratting is dead. LS isnt getting any better which means there are no viable options for those no longer wanting to stay in NS. NS wont get better since the stagnation will be even worse than before, they still havent fixed fozzie sov, still have millions of timers to attend and citadels to grind down. Even if you win a war right now, you are still the loser cause you have to clean up hundreds of citas. And not to mention that every sec system is in dire need of a complete revamp.
---
Im fairly certain none of these things will change during the age of chaos, not in any significant manner. Devs only have so much time after all. So Im thinking, wait and get raped in NS for 18 months without actual progress in the things that are broken or just quit the game cause there are no viable options. And Im not alone in this thinking.
---
They should have started with all the other changes first, then done these things. It would have made much more sense and not come of as it has, burn NS.
---
Injectors also make CCP real money. They won’t remove them
---
THAT is a lot of work for a hobby website, no thanks
---
Check Faction Warfare, it has both plenty of PVP opportunities and is a good isk making activity, and it shouldn't hurt your sec status *that much*, allowing you to take some merc contracts in HS if that's what you want to do.
---
Other option would be to move to NPC nullsec and try your luck out there.

Get the “black ice “ or whatever implant, it’s really helpful
---
Train for a t3c depending on region you’re scanning in, and start using that with nullification once you can, that way you can run combat sites like 10/10s or 6/10s that you find with a refit. And more easily move around since you won’t get drag bubbled

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
---
and how much new blood did BR- bring into the game? that's what fuels the influx of new players, nullsec wars and the media attention!
---
[i knew your name sounded familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmS9vcVNr5A)
---
Derek's mass is less than most battlecruisers. The only CS that still sees frequent wormhole use is the Sleipnir, and even that has been largely supplanted by the Drek.
---
You can't warp supers into a fight.
---
If you somehow manage to get everyone aligned without bumping off of each other before you get scanned down and bubbled, you'll land in defensive bubbles and die horribly.
---
There are reasons things are done the way they are now, and after you go on a few super fleets, the reasons are painfully obivious.
---
If you want to bring replacmentments, sacrifice a reacon.
---
Otherwise make sure your reinforcements get around the bubbles to either your fleet or their fleet, depending if we are talking dread or fax here (supers and titans have too many hp to die unless DDs are used).
---
If you can't: Well, then you have dead supers/titans. Boohoo. There is too many of them anyway. Keep in mind: Your enemy is facing the exact same problems. If you want to keep Titans from bumping: Stop having some many of them occupying the same space.
---
I used the astero as an alpha. The quick align and good warp speed/ scan strength is really useful.
---
I did get chased more but yeah, you're always uncloaked while hacking anyway.
---
And in nullsec it's even more just a convenience while roaming. (Except for escaping bubles, but you don't have to escape bubbles every system either)
---
I didn't see the drones I thought they were II's
---
But now it's an Omega clone and not an alpha..
---
I thought the helios would get wrecked by a decently fit pvp astero?
---
Modules drop like a normal wreck, although their cost is usually marginal compared to the structure.
---
An oracle or two will delete a stationary azazu faster than a carrier will load grid and drop fighters and start pointing stuff. That's after the drop team has fed like 400m+ via recon.
---
&gt; Here's to hoping we see drifters coming back and wiping out structures and dropping on cap fleets.
---
except they never really did. yall are too blinded by your stupidity and GRR null.
---
I've always loved them (except the falcon it's shit)
---
replace 5 EC300 with offensive drones, to try to scare another astero to steal a site ;)
---
Completely agree with this.  I find these changes quite exciting.  Keep them coming and I'll reactivate.
---
Ccp dont profit from it.
---
Cause everything else needs to be farmed? If you have item A that costs 8 and item B that costs 2 it means that your budget of 10 can cover it. But if item A drops to 5 and item B goes up to 5 then your budget is still the same, i.e., purchasing power is what you actually have to look at, not just 1 specific item.
---
No it doesnt, at all. You think so but that number is directly connected to the amount of players. If it falls it mean you have less players, you have less demand for progression (SP) and in general a less active game. The price on PLEX should always go up, never drop like this.
---
   Careful, you’re touching a very delicate nerve. Eve is the only game that comes to mind, where the company  sells multiple subscriptions to a majority of subscribers. This feature while seemingly innocuous, is the real problem to most of the games gripes. 
---
 While  many of the players have 2-5 accounts. The game really thrives on the whales with 15-60 accounts.  
---
This is apart of the long standing inside joke why Eve will never die. That at the end of the servers life. There will just be a couple of stubborn Eve addicted whales duking it out. There is a grain of truth to that joke. 
---
In a game that pulls new players in. By telling them they will matter, and can compete with veterans. The obvious truth sinks in. To compete with X, you need X more accounts. 
---
  This is truly a game where you fight others with your wallet. Do not be fooled by veterans that will tell you otherwise.
---
If you’re an Eve addict, and I have left your feathers ruffled. Just swallow this Blue pill and relax. 
---
    You and your accounts are very skilled. Maybe all your subs saved CCP financially, and we should thank you!
---
Read, goon. No one said that they ever did that. It was a statement of hope that they would do that.
---
Be on your keyboard and get the fuck out if those ships get on grid, afaik they don't point you.
---
Not sure what's the idea behind that (probably fucking up afk miners, which I'm ok with) but it will probably just be a temporary event leading to something else.
---
Mining in LS might be more profitable and adviceable if it is as bad as you are saying it is, but you'd learn how to use DScan (you should anyway); other option would be to focus on moon mining while this lasts, afaik they don't go there.
---
At that point you pay more for the widow than for a decently fit cap and still wont get half the EHP said cap would have. Sure it is possible to get a "hard cyno" but it is a lot of isk for not *that* much ehp compared to a throwaway cap that still ensures better than a T2 BS.
---
Its your argument, not mine. Ye JFs are straight hardcore bro!
---
as someone who both lived in the drone regions as resident and staged in them against its residents... you're so hilariously wrong
---
Lmao that is p. funny
---
It was about as sarcastuc as I could make it, but really these are the changes. They’re good changes for everyone that’s not a part of the blue donut.
---
Oh yeah well I just resubbed 34 accounts for 7 years due to the changes
---
right, but by that time, the hordes of caps have already jumped in.
---
How about remove the client?
---
Jesus fuck you people have retarded ideas
---
 I like it too, even if it affects me in a way, that makes me move to where I belong ;)
---
Hate to break it to you, but a corp name doesn't mean people aren't experienced at the game. Furthermore, I'm in Unspoken now if it makes your salty ass less agitated.
---
If you actually want *chaos* instead of just mostly business as usual, you need the ability to put large nullblocks at risk. And without the ability to utilize a hard cyno, getting capital ships into an engagement reliably over any of the important shit that lets an alliance keep it's space, like a fortizar or keepstar, is close to impossible. Any cyno you light within the 300km grid will be dead before you can get the necessary ships in, and be my guest to try and jump everything in off-grid and hope you can successfully get to the right position on the fort or keepstar grid. Defenders will be able to put capital balls at zero on the structure with almost zero risk of an enemy dreadbomb or escalation taking them out. 
---
Just because your solution was shit, doesn't mean there isn't one. But don't get too mad when it turns out that your solution is garbage.
---
I'd recommend a Gila. It's the best abyss ship. Use meta 4 launchers, faction medium drones and T2 extenders/drone damage amps.
---
That'll get you through T3 gamma's as long as your skills are decent.
---
There are also Caracal fits for alphas to do T3 sites. Join the Abyssal lurkers channel in game, and they have a load pinned.
---
Work together? Fairly certain the basis of this entire change is that groups were TOO efficient at working together, hence "null is too safe". 
---
Dig a little deeper next time.
---
"sheep" and new players who don't want to wait years to get into some content in the game.
---
It's really not. Just becomes more alt heavy.
---
You can still hunt in a t3c. You just need to have your force recon sitting on a blops. So assuming this was your setup before:
---
Super
---
Exit cyno
---
Hunter
---
You now instead need:
---
Exit cyno (now force recon rather than throwaway, more SP needed)
---
Hunter (with covert cyno)
---
Blops
---
In-cyno
---
So still very much possible. Just way more SP and account intensive.
---
Thanks for the tip! I'll probably need a new character for this (or a lot of Alpha Injectors) since I've maxed out the Alpha free train limit, but I'll see what I can try.
---
Dude, you are the dick here. Why I even bother to take the argument. Cause your entire shtick is, "I have an NS alt and I trained into a carrier and if Im okey with changes then so should everyone else". 
---
Thats ignorant dude, and you know it.
---
Pity these things don't roam around in gangs large enough to threaten the massive ice belt bot fleets.
---
Man, imagine nerfing gameplay so that it requires pointing your eyes at the screen while playing. What madness EVE has come to.
---
&gt; *The last few years nullsec has become safer then highsec.* 
---
In the last few years every major coalition has been evicted from their space and their entire villages burned to the ground behind them, yet somehow it's safer lmao?
---
Well id say meh, you guys cyno jam everything but still manage to gate your supers when we tackled an aeon, remove gates?
---
I have 10 alpha accounts skilling basic alpha skills just in case if I want a new alt in a year I can have one with at least basic skills and skill towards what I need it. There'd be nothing stopping you from creating a new alt and start skilling towards a rorqual and then sell it and then take some of that money to pay for omega for yet another rorqual alt. The problem would still be there, just delayed a year. The problem isn't skill injectors but that you can multibox 10 rorquals at the same time making insane amounts of money. Make rorqual mining more engaging. Make it harder to multibox so many of them.
---
There are about 3,000 people left and enjoy a wide range of EVE games while pvp! Smart people!!
---
&gt;If you want to bring replacmentments, sacrifice a reacon
---
You have the same issue as you do in the initial in cyno. You might get one or two before the cyno dies.
---
&gt;get around the bubbles
---
How the actual fuck? Why didn't I think of "just going around bubbles" before. It's so easy.
---
Just to be clear, I'm talking about friendly bubbles to catch disconnects.
---
&gt;Well, then you have dead supers/titans. Boohoo. 
---
That's exactly what everyone wants: a good titan fight where some die, but you at least get a good fight.  But we're not talking about a GF, we're talking about having zero chance of winning, so we just stay docked.
---
&gt;Keep in mind: Your enemy is facing the exact same problems. 
---
Not if they are in grid first, which is the context here.
---
&gt;If you want to keep Titans from bumping: Stop having some many of them occupying the same space.
---
Literally one Titan and one Fax, jumping to the same cyno, have a reasonable chance of bumping off each other trying to align.  Maybe I just have bad luck, but I have issues almost every single time.
---
I don't think you have much experience in super fleets. This stuff is very obvious if you do.
---
So it pretty much sounds like you want everyone in bull to move out so you can move in without fighting for it.
---
*Since 2004
---
I would so love this. I think many others would 2. Content for both PvE and PvP, forcing both groups to cooperate so we stop being so god damn toxic to eachother and realise we need eachother.
---
Exactly, what would that BR look like after the changes?? It wouldnt have been such a brawl it would have been one side getting a free titan kill.
---
&gt;You couldn't buy 10+ Rorq alts because they just wasn't that many Rorqs characters available.
---
So sp farms is possible, but without injectors same people would not made "rorq alt" farms? Why? It does take time to train rorq normal way, but so it does to farm sp.
---
&gt;Caps+ were balanced because they were rare.
---
They are not rare now, and can not be rare, I guess. There's enough players who can fly them naturally, so without injectors it'll be obstacle for new players to get them, but it'd not make them any rare.
---
&gt;With Skillfarming, you can have a virtually limitless amount of alts. Your patience is the real limiter.
---
Well, yes. You could buy characters before, now can inject them. It's not so much of difference, but yes, it's now easier.
---
&gt;Back then, you could actually afford to play for free if you wanted. You could farm incursions for 10 hours
---
If your farming style does not let you farm plex in 10hours of dedicated play - you're doing something wrong.
---
&gt;They jumped much further than any newbro can ever catch up.
---
Overall - yes. In some class - no. It's hard to catch up old-players with sp even with Injectors, but they let you catch-up, for example, in battleship class, or cruiser class, or one capital. But overall - old players had more before injectors, have more after, nothing wrong with it, they played this game more.
---
&gt;more alts and better ships, which means they continue going on much faster than a newbro
---
Well, I guess there's some "sanity limit" for most of players, you can't expand your growing speed endlessly, does not matter how many isk/sp you got. Even if you have 20 titan alts - you are not gonna fly them all at once, and if you do - it'd not end well, most likely. But yes, I agree, old players had advantage before, have it now.
---
&gt;catching up with one with 40-50 mil skillpoints, on multiple alts, that is always increasing faster than you can hope to reach.
---
He is still one player. It's not like he can fly all 10x50mSP alts at once and be good at it. (unless it's 10 rorqs under cap umbrella, which is getting more risky now)
---
&gt;By the time you got to a battleship
---
Well yes, Injectors broke this forced by SP restrictions. You still have piloting skill restrictions for any ship. So injecting does not help you to "dunk" anyone.
---
Well I hope you keep doing sarcastic rants like this every time CCP "breaks all the things" with a change, that way noobs like me can join the discussion without making it obvious we don't know what we're talking about :P
---
If that's what they want to do, sure. I can play anywhere in EVE so I'm not bothered one way or the other.
---
It's actually a fantastic idea. It's a deterrence to lighting cynos unless your willing to take the risk of losing the ship in an instant ball of fire.
---
It's awesome. Now blops cynos will become the capital meta. Dedicated faxs repping deadspace buffer widows for hard cyno. Lol this game is more retarded every month. Still avoiding fixing real problems though like citadels fozzie sov and delve rorq spam
---
Who is making a big deal? What are you talking about?
---
But most of those capital nerfs were spot on. Pre all those nerds they were OP as fuck, people don't get they are much weaker now. The double ancillary Fax/rorqs were fuckin bricks. The Fax rep stacking penalties are also great for cap ship fights. Npc agging fighters changed carrier ratting for the better.  I say it again you guys don't know how good you had it, both Krabs and whalers.
---
Everybody speaks about cyno V . You need cyno V for lightning covert cyno
---
&gt; There is no natural progression anymore. Buy what you want to do, even if you are clueless and shouldn't be doing that yet.
---
Yes, and feed with this ones who are not clueless. That is fine by me.
---
&gt;Had you learned slowly in cheaper ships, with a corp around you teaching you
---
You still can do it, if you want.
---
The way ships move in eve is apparently gravity manipulation with "prongs" to produce a gravity well that the ship falls into...or an antigravity thing that pushes the ships along I don't remember.  But the reason that ships in eve apparently slow down and have a top speed is that these "prongs" cause gravitational drag or somthing.
---
 What we see as thrusters are actually the reactor exauset if you believe that explication for eve ship movment.
---
To be a little blunt, Eve Online is really bad about the concept of 'jobs.' There's no way to be profitable as a pvp-focused mercenary corporation, and even if you could, the methods used to gain product usually less-than-moral menthods, such as involving alts, suicide ganking, or just overall experience that you need to play in the game due to your corp's lack of needed (or right?) structure to pull such things off.
---
So here's a suggestion: if you want to fight for fun, try lowsec. Yes, it was suck for security status. But here's the key: as long as you don't destroy pods, it's very easy to keep your head above water, especially if you run things such as missions, ratting, or find clone tags to turn in for isk.
---
If that doesn't suite you, try null sec. Go in a mining ship and be protected by a bigger alliance. Get access to resources you never could imagine. Rat to your heart's content in fits that are provided and suggested by the bittervets. Go find a wormhole and explore data sites and gas mine and sell it for profit. And of course, when fleets are running, roam to your heart's content.
---
What I'm trying to say is, Eve Online is hard to be sustainable on your own, and 99% of the time people will be doing more than one thing to make profitable isk for their habits (if not, Plex). If you wish to keep your identity as a corporation, see if you could find an alliance willing to merge. See if there is space even out there and willing to be taken. 
---
Just don't forget that Eve is a large game and is easy to get lost or discouraged (blown up). There are thousands of people willing to help given the right opportunities but unless you wear their flag in one form or another, they *will* try to kill you here. 
---
Also as a last piece of advice get out of hisec!! It is boring and not fun and there is so much more to do than what you think there is up there. Don't be afraid to take risks, but also don't ever fly what you can't be willing to lose. Dealing with loss is the first major step towards success in the game.
---
Sorry to text dump all of this but I hope it helps. Feel free for a PM if you have more questions. We're here to help
---
The flaw in your argument is you are assuming they want to make the game better over making people buy plex.
---
Wormholers that use caps in in-static brawls are going to feel the burn a bit for sure.
---
haha i'm not salty at all - I'm loving the changes it is you who came here with salty posts about your OP toy being nerfed.

I'm just here to watch you whine :)

And sure, there are a few decent folks in Brave. Vargrin is great, Oh - wait...  
---
Well anyways, you seem to be having trouble understanding how you could adapt to the changes - so yeah I believe I will label you as a newbro :)  
---
My solution? I don't have any solution - it's not my problem, it's yours. But there are solutions - you just haven't figured them out yet.   
---
Anyways, it was fun trolling you - have a nice day!
---
You added that last part, I'm obviously just presenting my point of view like anyone else and pointing that I'm also affected by the changes... and I've only done so because you questioned that specific thing.
---
I mean, feel free to rage all you want, I still believe it's a good change but you are of course entitled to think otherwise.
---
You are welcome to mine in high sec all by yourself, play the market or even rat. Maybe try some abyssals etc. Don't expect to earn premium all by yourself though. Now go cry somewhere else. It has become too salty in here.
---
I think you mean no one.
---
Best I had from a 3/10 was about 250m between a-type adaptive nano plating, domination warp disruptor and a few other lesser value but still nice things. Worse I've had was just the overseer personal effects and single damage type nano plating (effectively worthless &lt; 4m each for explosive, under 500k for the rest.)
---
Not during the fucking blackout you don't.
---
I didn't read all that, but I guess I'll deal with this change the same way I dealt with Phoebe: unsub until they come up with a more reasonable iteration.
---
yeh, no clue whats gone on in my mind right now tbh, my bad
---
Lets see if these mythical old players actually come back or if we just lose current existing players.
---
oh, the reason is easy. I dont have the skills to use T2 ;)
---
You haven't seen the activity changes in regions on Dotlan have you then?
---
Why only against emp? Fusion ammo is a thing you know
---
Agreeing with a StainGuy post again. You seem to be growing on me. I'll have to call a doctor about that. ;)
---
CCP needs the isk that comes in from people buying extractors. I would propose they start selling boosters in the NEX.
---
IIRC the current training formula is Primary attrib + (Secondary*.5)= SP per minute.
---
If both attribs are 20, this would mean you 302000SP a week. Somewhat more than what is needed to max out a X1 rated skill starting from zero. Capital ships (rank 14) require something over 3.5 mil to reach level 5.
---
I'd like to see CCP selling boosters that raise all attribs in a manner similar to what the do in events today.
---
They could sell:
---
30 days +10 (1.5 training speed unoptimized)
---
30 days +20 (doubled)
---
30 days +80 (quintupled)
---
Sell them for 100/500/1000 plex or cash. don't much care. No sell by date.
---
No more injecting 20 mil in SP in seconds. You pay 1000 plex, you train much faster (almost 6.5 mil SP a month with top booster) but you still have to train and be a little patient. This means we can still address the "new players need to catch up" myth while at the same time stopping people from getting a day one cap pilot.
---
What!! Lol
---
 That's it! I've had enough of CCP and their bloody. These new changes to launcher graphics are literally an insult to every fork who has running. I am currently unsubbing my 74 accounts. I hope you're happy CCP you have ruined the game for Bukkake Inc! Goodbye forever crap CCP! I hope your poop game solidifying!
---
Look with all fairness eve is a pretty great game. It has survived longer than almost all other games on the market. It is current and also it can field a battle of 2000 people and still be playable to some extend. Even titles like WOW don’t come close to this number. I don’t regret supporting them in any way and I have learned that skill injectors even tough they seem unfair they don’t make you a good pilot they merely unlock the opportunity to learn to be a good pilot with a different ship.
---
If you want that kind of cyno then it costs isk. Cost is no object for some though. For small alliances who cant spare the manpower to run this setup of course it's a no no zone. But for big players why not? The concept is as close as you can get to a hard cyno for now.
---
I'm just trying to give ideas that's all.
---
It will if you don’t have backup waiting for you to web and scram them. You are the interceptor with a paper tank. Gotta go fast!
---
What do you mean by 'you people'... That's racist man...
---
Definitely dude, instanced 1v1 arenas with provided ships are what this game needs. Ty for your brilliant suggestions, next stop CCP job board
---
Pretty much left my orca afk mine for hours in highsec when i was at uni. Never happened anything. Think ill try that in null
---
But you need Cloaking V to join the exclusive elite Cloaking V club.
---
Then stop crying.
---
Cyno V is what people complain about, not Cloaking.
---
And it's because noone wants to light a regular cyno with a Recon to move a JF, because it is very likely to die.
---
hehe, pirate stronghold frigates maybe? learn the game before complaining
---
I agree that Pay to win is increased via micro transactions.
---
I think they will quickly change some of this tbh
---
Big alliances will still benefit. Little guys will suffer. 
---
CCP is not addressing the real problem...injectors
---
Lol, no you wont. Prices on them has to do with mats and those are gonna be farmed less. So is the recon.
---
&gt;over 1 million plex a day is spent on extractors or injectors. On average.
---
I'm betting you are orders of magnitude too low.
---
care to help me make it better? its obviously a pure explorer, not meant to fight at all. and I've been through quiet some gate camps and managed to warp away from cloaky Lokis, Stratios, Tengus etc a lot of times. its basically, scan, warp, lock, hack, warp and you're done. I appreciate any upgrade on the fitting though :)
---
🤤
---
are you seriously using carebear provi in this? 
---
its time to go out and spend the money youve earnt guys, or make slightly less overall in the long run,
---
or work in groups to make money not just be solo no comms no plan guys
---
Sadly this cyno shit is adaptable by pretty much anyone in game, probably more so with the big groups. 
---
So... Not seeing much chaos come from it...
---
Nice to see things changing though
---
Even multiboxing won't save you from losing your Force recon for moving your own caps through low sec now.
---
You dont have to, if you dont have any friends just move them by gate.
---
&gt; Read, goon
---
what is this "read" you speak of?
---
yep, its working perfectly. those that cant handle it go elsewhere
---
Dirt 'n' glitter is a decent option especially if you are looking for eu tz groups. They have hauling and a few other services as well.  But the best fw group for you really depends on your tz.
---
So OP, what happens if youre wrong? Whats the failsafe? What happens if it turns out exactly as some are predicting? Whats your plan to get the players back?
---
why not just add a charge up. cyno inhibs take a minute, just make the cyno charge up the same. Then give a ship bonus to reduce that on a select group of hulls and off course the covert cyno. Subs 10-30s charge, caps and up stay at the 1 minute
---
Rorqs/capitals will have to light before an inhib gets dropped, haulers just have to wait a little longer but otherwise fine. maybe do ad the covert cyno for JF. big fleets will have to protect the cyno or bring a ship with a reduction bonus.
---
Cloaking V is a very good skill, allows your covert artyloki to start locking after 3 seconds with the concord cloak.
---
the quality of pvp. the meta changes, the quality of the pvp gameplay, the risk vs reward balance. is infact, perfect
---
&gt;  For small alliances who cant spare the manpower to run this setup of course it's a no no zone. But for big guys why not? 
---
That doesn't make sense. Isk cost has nothing to do with manpower.
---
because you should play with others and organize with friends to get your capital away.
---
because the pve'er run for the hills. the pvpers are fighting/hunting elsewhere.
---
Used to take two plex (so 1000 newplex) to transfer a character, so about 30-40 dollars.  CCP absolutely profited from it, managing it is just more work than injectors (the aforementioned dealing with scams, etc).
---
Players still use the Nighthawk? Since when?
---
Lol fucking gross. Incursion comms make me want to off myself.
---
Godspeed
---
If the toon selling is underground presumably CCP has no responsibility to deal with scams?  Do it above board or risk the consequences.
---
It's totally great for delve, but goons are still going to oppose it out of love for &lt;ccp financials/small groups/newbeans&gt;. Good people
---
well given their role.... shouldnt they have a cyno?
---
light cyno on baddon, when near time, boosh boosh boosh boosh boosh bang cyno up on 0m with abbadon :D not saying this is good or bad, sounds hella fun. but... maybe not what they want. they want clear cyno ship choice. clear intentions with high risk to light a cyno
---
I saw his ticker and I was like fuck those retards get me in there
---
(he was mad af, op success)
---
Getting friends to help is part of the game. Capitals are big and supposed to be part of a fleet. Work together. I look forward to the day when jump drives are removed and JFs have to be escorted through lowsec to resupply nullblocks
---
I don't think I've ever jumped more than 10 carriers onto anybody that wasn't Fraternity, but don't let facts get in the way of your dank memes. Also TIL 15 people is a "blob"
---
Marauders role is L4 in highsec :P
---
Also we get BlackOps for the tankier cynos... expensive cynos...
---
so your unhappy a hisec rat shot your drones while you were afk? shame.
---
a cruiser rat will not track light drones if theyre set to agressive
---
You obviously have never dropped caps in a large engagement, just STFU.
---
i tend to "just believe" lol
---
I'd love to see your list of meaningful changes that can't be averted with injectors. Jump fatigue? Easy, inject more alts and make them jump. Cyno changes? Inject recons. Subcap changes? New meta will be sorted in a week or so just fly that. 
---
I'm not being snarky I'd actually be curious what you can't just get aroundwith  injectors because I can't think of anything specific.
---
idk what you mean by "you guys" but i guess you fell for the flair - im not in Frat and over the last few weeks i was in a lot of situations where i wouldve been happy if people had to gate their supers or at least jump them to beacons and warp. 
---
P.S. Frat doesn't seem to jam everything, when we tackled one of their Aeons they dropped a lot of shit, a Revenant among it.
---
I have one friend who happens to be an fc for snuffed... he helps me out when dirty spodbrain goons come for my bait beacon
---
Or nerf it all
---
Fuck caps
---
Oh, how you wish he were wrong, right? Too bad for you.
---
20 is too low tbh
---
on the one hand you're not wrong, mechanics wise cynos are not very elegant, on the other hand lmao flying caps on your main
---
I think they might partially roll some changes back (like how they eased off on Jump Fatigue) but the core of the change will still be there.  I don't think Observatories will just restore local, I don't think we'll ever see cynos on capitals again.  They might allow more ships to fit cynos, they might have observatories provide some sort of counterplay to cloaks.
---
True story we had to make our maps in excel...
---
[http://www.tradewars.com/](http://www.tradewars.com/)
---
I wonder what eve would look like if from the start they didn't allow multiboxing. I used to just accept it as "this is the way it is" but now I wonder... How would it be if you had to rely on other players more instead of alts. I would like to think that was CCP's intention from the start, to have players cooperate more since the game clearly isn't designed to be played alone, but then they got sidetracked when they saw their bank statement I guess. Which honestly would be really sad, if a part of their initial basic vision was put down the shitter right from the start for money lel.
---
Im asking. Do you have an answer or you just wanna be cute?
---
&gt;but they're easy to get a
---
Which is meaningless to big alliances because the recons will just be added to ship replacement schemes. 
---
So again, who does this hurt? Power projection by goons, test, etc.? Not in the slightest. The ability of small corps or alliances to field capitals? Yes. 
---
Basically, CCP is enshrining (once again) the large null sec blocks as the permanent *and only* holders of null sec sov space, while pricing capital ships out for everyone else.
---
Maybe they are afraid that Wow classic will suck players out of Eve?
---
It’s a hard cyno that’s up for 5min instead of 10. I use these all the time because they’re faster. Usually ppl don’t fuck with them. Literally down in a siege cycle. It’s also less fuel so u can relight more often. It adds more use to these ships that aren’t used a ton. Most ppl use t3cs for hunting so this will make them used for that. And it’ll be easier to defend against a hunting party that wants to Titan bridge or bridge caps because nothing is interdiction nullified that can light a hard cyno. It’s going to be fun and null krabs will adapt eventually after their tears have settled.
---
Not to sound like an ass here but are we entering Boycott levels of frustration here? Because I'm on the fence if I'm even going to resub at this point.
---
Rich guy with a ton of alts. I'm  not buying injectors to boost my 20m+ accounts. I'm making a bunch of low SP utility alts. Recon will be next. 
---
If you want my opinion. Just make it so you can only use injected SP towards Core and combat skills. Not utility skills or most ship skills.
---
Well, FHP is back, Eran is minmatar now, amarr-min FW is still active (i.e.: I killed 8 ships and 5 pods last evening solo so actually active.) I'd won eve for 6 years when I joined back in January. 1500 kills later still enjoying it...
---
your correct, cloaking 4 is all youll need to fly the ships with the cloak fitted, however the latest change is about cynos, which you will need cyno field level 5 to light the covert cynos needed for jump freighter travel
---
Words coming from the same people who were saying PvP is up. Why should I trust you when data isnt backing up the other lies?
---
Oh look, another change targeted at shaking up the game for experienced players and large groups... It seems that CCP still has not learned that these changes hurt small groups more than larger ones.
---
This change will have a middling impact on us who are in the larger blocks. As we have the capacity to for a strong flash forms and titan cannon them to our beacons. 
---
But this change will also aid us in hunting less organized groups with our black ops fleets as we will not need to worry about supercap response within the 1-2 minutes we need to kill most targets.
---
The fix is dont redeem the RAF SP, leave it in the Inventory menu, and don't buy the Starter Pack until you hit the cap.
---
The problem isn’t that caps are “too OP” or over nerfed. The problem is that they are the biggest slowest ships in the game and up until now they could be moved to a combat grid instantly for no cost besides fuel and an available alt on grid. The cyno change addresses that by punishing cap drops. 
---
Is it the solution I’d have chosen? Not particularly.
---
Is it an attempt in the right direction? Yes.
---
Mail me the login info and I will double that.
---
Careful, people who buy Plex seem to have an irrational hatred for people who PvE/mine/whatever to make isk to pay for ships
---
rorqual pilots are going to have to be that perceptive if they want saved. If worst comes to worst with a rorqual you go with the dread bomb contingency and burn a covops. Your theory is mixing up cynos btw. If your getting a sabre on field then you lit a normal cyno. Everyone is now aware what your doing.
---
Yes.
---
And the list is currently 2 ships.
---
I was stating that those 2 ships seems a bit too restrictive.
---
It could be 4 ships.
---
Or 6 ships!!
---
That fill someone different roles and purposes.
---
Honestly the biggest issue is that capitals should have never been more than support or utility ships.
---
Maybe you should learn the game before typing here. They are Triglavian Recons roaming the High Sec. Added in the last update. Check the notes.
---
Well it does here and there. A 25man 2bil a ship Loki fleet can fight a lot more than a 25man Cerb fleet (that cost less than a third of the Lokis) can. But in this case I don't see why a small alliance would have need for a hard cyno anyway.
---
A super in warp never hurt anyone either.
---
Remove Cyno, Add either Neut or Smart bomb.
---
My favourite part of this era of chaos thing going on is the salt, this is some top tier salt, I love it.
---
Make the background blue screen blue and make the letters bright yellow and italic. Add snowfall effect.
---
It's not about bringing back old veterans.  It's a decision made with many more to follow leading the way to a steady population and potential increase of new players.
---
Wow had the same transition. They changed the game massively and lost lots of old veterans years ago. They didn't worry because the aim was to secure a future playerbase.
---
The change is clearly one of many and they will be getting feedback to issues that arise that they never even thought off.
---
unfortunately this topic is already dead ... i had this idea when i was hearing this track from cowboy bebop and remembered this red eye drug
---
i thouoght it'd fit well as lore base XD and it also would allow for a bit more freedom on effects to not make you a dead in the water sitting duck but a duck with very narrow blinkers on crack
---
I think he's implying it doesn't make sense for small groups, because why would they use a blinged out hard cyno to bring in a few friends?  Hard cynos are for bringing the batphone to an active grid.
---
data? this is a snippet of homewritten info that to be fair, the way reddit is going, how can you trust the OP's numbers,
---
fact is, since blackout i myself have been mroe active, no intentionally. just more going on, more fun while undocked. going by me and my surroundings, thres more going on now than ever.
---
but less money being made, spot on
---
I mean...instantly moving the biggest ships in the game to an active combat grid...that’s not a problem. 
---
Especially not when their biggest drawback is supposed to be their speed an ability to respond to a subcap fleet.
---
...what? My playstyle is absolutely covert cyno drops.
---
Current change:
---
2 ships can use cyno.
---
Me: hmm, 2 ships might be too restrictive
---
You: NO IF THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE WILL JUST USE WHATEVER IS THE CHEAPEST...
---
Me: yes...no matter if the list is 2 ships or 100 ships, people will just use the cheapest...what is your point?
---
You: REEEEE
---
Exactly. 
---
People have become reliant on cloaks for "PvP". Then they cloak and run again. 
---
And then they have the audacity to call anyone else risk averse. It's some pretty strange mental gymnastics.
---
Don't fool yourself. Most titan "fights" you have titans shooting at FAX machines and dreads until one side decides they don't want to bring more FAX and clears out.
---
I challenge you to find a fight on zkill where that wasn't the case.
---
About you having zero chance of winning: You can clear the enemy in-cyno, which also is just a recon or blops and catch bumping titans and supers while keeping them from lighting new recon cynos.
---
Ofc, if you let the enemy set up a nice titan/super blob with FAX, all you can do is clear out the FAX with dread bombs or subcapitals and prevent them from bringing new ones. Or stay docked and cry on reddit.
---
Dude please dont. Its such a bad argument that a ship with a jump drive is able to use said jump drive. Its something built into the hull and the price reflects it. And you cant just change narrative mid point since most people have been lying about caps being OP for a long time.
---
If you dont know the direction, then how would you know if its in the right direction?
---
smartombs, neuts, trackor units and remote reps, links easier to fit, FSU units easier to fit in
---
Well on one side, we have a already broken game that is proven that it needs a correction, therefore the devs are doing it. And on the other side we have a 'probability' that the said correction could be bad. My money is on the first one.
---
Zkill numbers are saying the same.
---
And you are presenting pure anecdotal evidence which means literally nothing. 
---
And you are sure that part is correct? I can trust OPs numbers there?
---
But if you wanted real fights you'd be fighting each other already?
---
So why were you crying up until now??
---
Your whole argument hinges on that bit, "buddy". 
---
"Boohoohoo I can't possibly kill bomber fleets"
---
No, I'm keeping it on the accounts just to spite you and people like you.
---
The purpose is to limit cynos. You seem to want the restriction to be circumventable so the result is basically the status quo.
---
My redeemer fit is 1k dps and 100k eh and it isnt crazy blinged out... with some fancy mods you could def hit those numbers
---
You know, I concluded pretty much the same thing, probably about the time you were typing that.
---
The subs are of value to CCP, yes.  I mean the value is the literal cost of the sub in currency you complete cretin.
---
Lol, Mar5meca. You can be 12 out of 10 happy right now, but you do realize this just *enshrines* goons power as forever unchallengable. Also, I cannot wait until this change happens and you start to think you can actually be successful at dread bombing in Delve. 
---
The salt from your tears will be the sweetest of all.
---
Dont see why and they are too tanky.
---
Plex to injectors is a P2W mechanic. I hate it.
---
But mining doesn't make isk.
---
Whoever “You guys” was, probably had a continued statement or context along the lines of...
---
“You guys never undock unless it’s in a super blob”
---
Meaning that you never undock subcaps with the intention of an actual fight, mostly just to chase people with fighters or boson subs.
---
Man I remember back in 2010 the first time I loaded up eve and actually left fear to undock and fly around cause it was so easy to get shit on anywhere you went. 
---
Fast foward 8 years and it was basically safe to fly anywhere always because there was essentially no threats and everything is super easy, and the what was supposed to be the scariest of spaces was actually the safest of spaces. 
---
Now things are starting to go back to the roots and everyones shitting bricks, but I’m convinced this was the vision for eve from the beginning. Space is fucking scary, bad things happen, be careful, fly safe.
---
not true
---
youve taken this further than i for sure, now do the same for every region accross new eden, and finally youll have evidence only semi worthless unless taken over a 2 month period and compared to the same 2 month period from last year and the year before, as even weather can affect activity, and CCP didnt nerf the sun.
---
When titans run security on almost every gate in a region. That's when you know you've gone too far
---
How is it proven? I mean, explain to me how its broken in the first place why dont you? Why the devs are doing anything is beyond us both, we dont know their reasoning.
---
You still havent responded. You know why? Because you dont have an answer. If things dont go the way you hope they will...
---
...you sell it to make isk. Just like you sell ratting loot/salvage. And sell Pi materials. And sell explo loot.
---
Skill injectors exist because the game is over 16 years old and new players have no way to make up that training /xp any other way. 
---
There could restrictions on injectors though. Only so many used in a monthly time frame for example.
---
&gt;Whats your plan to get the players back?
---
Everyone who comes back gets a pink titan SKIN and a private instanced belt that never stops spawning NPCs to boson.
---
Makes sense. More you use less effective they become
---
For fights, instead of using interceptors or corvettes you're going to have to use recons. Wow. big nerf. 
---
The biggest salt source probably is the the fact that you no longer have invulnerable rorq cynos. But those are cancer and any solution to them is mild.
---
Thats punishment dude, get away with your (actually, pink titan skin might be fun) shit.
---
Smart bombs it is then!
---
How?
---
Circumventable HOW?
---
How, in this cartoon world you live in, does anything I've said suggest I want the change to be circumventable?
---
Give me the breakdown of that?
---
&gt; I've heard h
---
Hey, check out the sov map. How many small alliances still hold sov again?
---
The counter point there is that, most of these problems would arise eventually anyways, this just lets the number of people using rorqs or whatever hit the number where they realize it’s a problem, sooner
---
Not at home, but ill show you a fit when i get home om sunday that i've used for fleet fights.
---
Aha so no data means anything anymore? Ill tell all the scientists to pack up their shit because everything is random.
---
!remindme 3 days
---
As a comparison, I got a 165M module two days ago but I ran 3 x 3/10 escalations chained before it dropped. Sometimes it feel like an even more extreme version of WH/Null exploration which I can regularly make 30-50 mil in little trips where as 3/10 is feast or famine. But if you are doing it in a cheap fit - it is a nice fun activity to mix things up - I have been doing all mine in a cormorant.

---
&gt; Shitty Mechanics and bad balancing is the problem. 
---
I disagree. Players tend to go inactive or leave entirely after months or years. This means (in the past) there was always a crop of people working to get into caps but that was balanced by the people leaving or taking a break. PL was a small alliance that punched well above its weight because they excelled at poaching these rising pilots and were able to amass a large capital fleet.
---
Today, I can log in for the first time and be a cap pilot. This has led to a glut in cap pilots. I've played for over ten years. I have two cap pilots. I have met people playing for a year with four. I wouldn't be shocked if someone told me a dozen new cap pilots a day were being injected.
---
I do it manually for regions in my personal interest. Sadly dotlan has only monhtly statistics. :-(
---
It just beyond you, not me. It has been broken for years, and playerbase was asking for a chang4 for years now. Now finally they are listening. Here is your proof. If you think devs do things out of the blue then you are proabably not old enough to understand anything tbh.
---
"You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door.
---
There is a small mailbox here."
---
If they are invisible, they are not killing you. If they are killing you, they are not invisible and therefore killable. One-shottable by pretty much any anti-frig platform, even.
---
Hell, if they are invisible you can still do AOE damage to them.
---
So CCP is making money of a highly addicted small fringe of OCD players? We have just hit peak capitalism, like again.
---
I mean, it totally is a gift to delve. Who will ever be able to compete with our super fleet now? Nobody. Ever. Thanks, CCP.
---
So just join the super mega alliance that shits on everyone and lets literally anything with or without a pulse into their group. Hide underneath thier supercap umbrella and never worry again. Problem solved.
---
It still does
---
It won't even hurt me very much in lowsec, it's just horribly annoying. I can drop a fax every time if I want and keep my shitty recon alive. It just makes stuff like combat rorq ganks and baiting more aids and less fun.
---
I misunderstood, then. I thought you were complaining about being blobbed by them. The last few days have seen a duel of "Provi never undocks" and "Provi blobs". I thought you were commenting along those lines. My apologies.
---
you maybe see some increase in Delve or 2 other region, because all hunters move there, because all areas has massive drop of activity or targets...
---
I am embracing it. This is why I deactivated *all* of my alt accounts (3). I no longer need them, because now I have finally been liberated. My supers will stay docked until the alliance needs them, and provides me a cyno without me having to pay for the alt/skill injectors/multi-training certs.
---
Make carriers more expensive. Problem solved
---
&gt;So sp farms is possible, but without injectors same people would not  made "rorq alt" farms? Why? It does take time to train rorq normal way,  but so it does to farm sp.
---
People were creating farms, but they were not cheap. You need to keep them subbed, so you're paying 15$/month to create your Rorqual char to sell. Compare that to skillfarms, where creating a farm can be done for essentially free right now. You could get one, but not 10+ per people who could afford them. You also needed to pay for each alt monthly, so even if you could get 10 Rorq alts, you also needed to pay 150$/month to use them, compared to free right now because of skillfarms.
---
&gt; They are not rare now, and can not be rare, I guess. There's enough  players who can fly them naturally, so without injectors it'll be  obstacle for new players to get them, but it'd not make them any rare. 
---
That's true and that's why people say that injectors broke the game. Caps were in a good place before injectors and they're in a bad place now. That's why there are a lot of calls to nerf them.
---
&gt; Well, yes. You could buy characters before, now can inject them. It's not so much of difference, but yes, it's now easier. 
---
It's a world of difference. Back then, if I wanted 10 Rorq alts, I'd completely empty the market of all Rorq alts. Nobody else could buy other Rorq pilots, there just wasn't that many. Then, I'd have to pay 150$/month to keep them subbed. Right now, I can inject them for free and keep them subbed for free.
---
&gt; If your farming style does not let you farm plex in 10hours of dedicated play - you're doing something wrong. 
---
Please tell me of the playstyle that a newbro can get 200mil/hr per char within 5-6 months. You can fly a 4-5 bil Gila and farm T4/5, but you first need to accumulate 4-5 bil and get the skills required to fly that Gila. It's not cheap and only really achievable if a newbro focuses on that playstyle exclusively.  Back then, You could run incursions with 500mil Maelstorm and get that 1bil for PLEX in 10 hours. Much more achievable.
---
&gt; but they let you catch-up, for example, in battleship class, or cruiser class, or one capital. 
---
Do you really need to catch up though? You can fly an okay battleship or a good cruiser after 2-3 weeks. It's not that long and you can fly an okay cruiser within 1 day. Or, even better, a good tackle frigate within 1 day. There are a lot of things you can do while you wait for that 2-3 weeks.
---
&gt; He is still one player. It's not like he can fly all 10x50mSP alts at  once and be good at it. (unless it's 10 rorqs under cap umbrella, which  is getting more risky now) 
---
You can easily use 3 alts at once to farm or pvp (that's my standard setup). I'm currently growing my setup to farm with 6 chars at once (and probably moving to Rorqs after this). By the time that you can get 3 farming alts, I'll be on Rorqs and by the time you can get on 10 Rorqs, Eve will probably be dead or dying. On a side-note, rorqs under a super umbrella (especially 10 Rorqs) are actually very hard to remove off the field because of the PANIC module. Their drones are their only vulnerable point. Rorqs under an umbrella have been basically not affected by the blackout, only their excavators were.
---
Proper DPS fit boats that are manually piloted with a basic understanding of how combat mechanics in anoms work shit all over your afk drone boat income. and they always have.
---
Who said we weren't. Nobody was crying also. All we hear is risk averse people crying over every little change that affects their safe gameplay. Try another game, eve is no longer for you.
---
Capital ships still can't jump to cov cynos though, it'll be recons using normal cynos
---
You’ll see the value of a carrier drop. Probably supers will drop too. Ppl will try to get rid of them. 5 Covertors can already mine as much as a rorqual. The price of coverts will adjust. As for content and hunting... I’ve been hunting during this blackout and most ppl have been ratting in gated sites now which require a lil more skill to hunt in because the battleships that hunt in them usually mjd to the other side of the room. Killing carriers is ok, there have been less in the game as of late. Mostly just big null blocks, that’s ok too because with the changes coming those carriers will need an alt to light their cyno to bring in help. Not all hunters go for carriers. I remember when killing a carrier or super was rare and exciting. Now it’s meh and “oh look another one.” I’m hoping it gets back to having that flair when you finally kill one. I’m not looking for the game to be easy with everyone flying supers. Then killing a super would be like killing a Rifter. Hunters are required to communicate and work together. If you want to beat us just communicate and work together. Lately it’s never been easier to set up baits and traps in null. Just use your head for once and join comms. Or go rat in a gated site where it’s safer. Judging by plex prices you can see the your isk is becoming worth more in game. Supply and demand curves will soon apply to the new metas.
---
It will suck players out of every game, at least until they realize that they are still playing WoW and reasume their normal activities.
---
I think that what they are afraid of is Tranquility becoming Serenity, and I don't blame them.
---
In the next wave of chaos CCP should introduce injector addiction - too many injectors and you become addicted, losing your gained sp overtime if you don't keep up with your habits.
---
Maybe spod brain can be an ingame disease too.
---
And a lot of people moved back to hisec, where they were before blackout. This massive exodus out of null is just a reverse of the massive exodus out of hisec that happened years ago.
---
Even your reddit name shows that you are a crybaby faggot.
---
Why when I try to export my corp logo, or go on zkill, or any other third party site, my corp logo is the default. 
---
Even when I try to use https://image.eveonline.com/ and put in my corp ID, it returns the corp id of 1 instead and gives the default.
---
I have a corp logo created and saved in-game. Only out of game is it wrong.
---
Pvpers aren’t crying. Pve’ers like you are crying haha. *no u*
---
But do people in power have the same goals as us mere mortals?
---
Can’t capitals go through gates now?
---
It's just reached the point of hardly being fun anymore. Might as well just gate my super around lowsec collecting salt, it's more fun
---
Shhhh, ever seen a spodbrain start crying? Just watch the thread.
---
Sorry but that's how eve will work from now on. How it should have been from the start. Bye byee
---
thats why our PCU average dropped by 2k since blackout and is in the state of 2006 instead of rising like it was back then its declining?
---
cause we retain players by this changes?
---
CODE actually has excellent fits.  Cats, Vexors, Thrashers, Taloses, Brutixes (Brutii?) etc. Very specific, very optimized.  
---
Good for null fleet combat?  Of course not.  But if you want to melt someone as fast as possible CODE fits are the best.
---
I mean for jump freighters you idiot.
---
Grow up.
---
what are you flying btw?
---
It is well known that ships with variable damage types only carry one type of ammo
---
Oooh, we can add "sperg" and "buttmad" to the BBTB2 cringe-post Bingo card!  Keep it coming!
---
there will be playerbase drop. what that is is the crybaby  farm sim players are gone. what i mean, is more people are having FUN playing this game than before :D 
---
whatever, works over, time to hunt some crybabys dying to farm isk for thier RMT's
---
And wormhole sites.
---
incomplete data is more useless than no data - FACT
---
Cute that you think like that to feel right about yourself. I have been laughing my ass off since tha blackout. It is so fun to read every crybabies comments here and collect their salt after every change to their safe playstyles.
---
If you're camping for T2 Frigate cynos as he said he would, then you'll be camping for covert cynos.
---
If price of item A drops, the price on everything has not gone up. I dont see why prices would go up because plex goes down.
---
&gt;No it doesnt, at all. You think so but that number is directly connected to the amount of players. 
---
Cheaper plex means more players have access, which likely results in more players in game.
---
&gt;If it falls it mean you have less players, you have less demand for progression (SP) and in general a less active game.
---
The reason it was so high recently was because it was feeding the bots, rorqs, and other cancers. It was an artificially high price not supported by the "mainstream" player.
---
&gt;The price on PLEX should always go up, never drop like this.
---
Not sure what the price should be, but certainly activities other than cap ratting, rorqs, and botting should be viable if one wants to buy plex.
---
Hahahaha! 
---
**Pro Blackout:** "The blackout is great for PVP, now we can finally catch and kill people! It will be awesome! We are getting *sooo many* fights now." 
---
**Non Blackout Person:** "But look at this data, pvp activity is down significantly since the blackout..."
---
**Pro Blackout:** "Yes. See, just as I said. This shows the game is now balanced better. It is working exactly as we said it would."
---
When you see yourself being hunted I’m sure you just dock up. When someone with half a brain see they’re being hunted they tell their friends to get the counter ready. If you can see the zkill of the hunter then u can see what’s coming for u and prep an adequate counter. If you’re the guy that docks up and goes and plays another game then you’re right. This sucks.
---
Have one:
---
Hacking minigame for citadels to eject some contents from peoples hangars into space in a secure container with a perfect hack
---
Then, spawn nodes in adjacent constellations which need to be entosised, with a 15 node completion for the attacker, this gives you access to the dropped cans contents if it's still there by the time you get back.
---
This isn't an airport, no need to announce your departure
---
Implying anyone cares about C5 corps
---
This guy gets it, its not quite n1 but close enough. Same will happen with rorqs people well drop 1 rorq place said brick cyno on feild prema repped by whales then light it, while the hunters own cyno recon is far more vulnerable to being burnt down.
---
&gt;so basically making us unable to mine for funds
---
No, they made you unable to completely afk while you mine.
---
Now you have to play the game. The fucking horror.
---
Wrong, if we had no injectors or nerfed them  we would just see another huge spike in toon selling and trading
---
Ah misread what you were replying to. Too many crybabies here.
---
You get a chaos, and you get a chaos, and you get a chaos, everyone gets a chaos !
---
New idea for entosis:
---
Entosis cap. 25% entosis rate maximum per hour of actively run entosis. Could be per node, or per hub I am open to discussion on it.
---
Always have a buddy with instalock svipul for this cases.
---
Overview blackout is also a wonderful idea BTW. It would really nerf botting VNIs
---
I am beginning to think no changes coming to CCP means we really *need to* worry.
---
the other day, our small gang held cloak after jumping through a gate, a scout malediction landed, saw nothing. no local. jumped. we decloaked burnt to gate and bubbled. somthing was comming!!!
---
dscan showed a small, sort of equally sized fleet of cruisers, who land in our bubble. 
---
oh my theyre caracals, landing next to us, and we are in blaster thorax's. they land in our range, and a fight commences, deaths happen. scout is laughed at.
---
this, is, fucking, good, pvp.
---
the fact krabbers and isk hoarders arnt making as much anymore is nothing, it was physically disgusting listening to daily comms of people just earning isk and ping warrioring. like damn guys,
---
 undock and enjoy it stop being such pussies
---
Don't let grath hear you say that.
---
He'll call you an anti-social cocksucker
---
While fusion is decent, too. A falcon with two invuls and one EM hardener is weakest against EMP. I chose the worst ammunition for the tank.
---
First time I actually agree with someone from CODE, and two posts in a row. :O
---
Representing a single data point, I'm an old player that came back for Blackout. By now I'm laughing maniacally. I love this.
---
it's a feature of the forum software. but higher level users and posts require more to flag to hide it.
---
wrong, talking in local is an important part of wormholes
---
Also, if they nerf in game income generation, then the thinking is thst they'll force people into buying PLEX, for €$£
---
Gotta give their new masters some sweet, sweet revenue.
---
Where can I find the autopiloting freighters in nullsec?
---
Cloaky nullified Loki
---
For a significant amount more effort than drone ratting, and still for less income than the same or less effort in an incursion.
---
These NPCs are definitely unfair to new and/or unaware players.
---
I've since "adapted" to them and replaced my Covetors with fully tanked Procurers and put a remote rep on the Orca - and now I can kill even gangs of 6. Sometimes they just keep fucking coming wave after wave so I'll just move to another system.
---
Another terrible idea from CCP. They really can't help themselves. :p
---
More ships able to fit cynos weakens the nerf. A weaker nerf results in a less effective nerf.
---
If you could fit a cyno to a normal cruiser, the nerf wouldnt be such a big deal since they are so cheap. You could nerf cynos in other ways, but if CCP has decided on doing it this way, the ship must be expensive or it wont matter.
---
Found the nullsec alt in wormholes
---
I guess you're just to elite for this world.
---
How much plex do you have? The launcher now consumes 50 plex per launching cycle per account.
---
I'm willing to bet you are out of plex and thats the problem.
---
Have you ever heard of a covetor? It’s a very easily replaceable ship that can mine a lot. 5 covetors mine as much as a rorqual. They can easily mine their own value in a few minutes, especially on moons. If covetors aren’t working for u the get a proc. They are good too and are rly tanky. Just adapt. Mine while u train the covops. Sell the JF maybe. It’s huge and slow. Or charge more for JF runs to replace covops. Or you can be smart and light your covops on the stations in lowsec when no one is in the system so u don’t lose them. Covops cynos are only 30sec.
---
is there a way, via out-of-game resources, to identify ihubs and other sov infrastructure that have defense timers set in a certain window?
---
Reeeeeee moda fakas.
---
Please define "natural progression".
---
Before injectors my progression through this game was. Mining is boring, lets train for combat. Do missions until I try some PvP. Gets killed repeatedly by people flying ships that is faster, has more survivability, does more dps and flown by people who knows the game better than me. I figure, I need more skills so I at least can fly the same things. Back to missions. Quit the game because level 2 missions are boring AF and it pays shit.  
---
Second attempt: Start playing together with some friends. Buy plex (the old kind), can afford a Drake and start doing level 3 missions. Pay sucks but me and my friends have grand plans. My friends quit because they have the same problems I had the first time. I quit because I don't have skills enough for level 4 missions and level 3 missions are boring AF and doesn't pay enough.  
---
Third attempt: Skill injectors are a thing and I happen to have irl money so I can afford to get some. I skill into good skills with frigates. Dies twice in a row, learn how to fit better with better modules because I have enough skills to use them. I Get my first kill. I get better and when I no longer feel like I'm shit at the game. Dare to join a proper corp because, as mentioned, I no longer feel like dog shit. I inject into basic exploration skills and find it fun which results in me joining a group that does scanning and small gang pvp. We start doing blops and I can join in because I can inject some skills and fly a bomber. I start skilling into T3C and fly them (legion master race), I inject some of the skills. Now, some months later I can hunt targets and I've started skilling towards Black Ops ships so I can bridge too if needed.
---
What kind of progression do you find better? The one that leads me to quit out of boredom waiting for skills or the one where I can spend slightly more than double the money that it would've cost to keep a subscription but no wait time and I actually enjoy my gametime?
---
Claim it was only cyno bots leaving and that the game is healthier because of it, obv.
---
The point is to remove the capability from capitals... not small ships. LOL!
---
No never what's a cap? You mean capacitor ?
---

---
Check and mate. Pretty terrible when your entire argument can be invalidated by empirical evidence which was provided a few days ago on the very same sub you are posting  on.
---
As a second reply to this, 
---
 **Non Blackout Person:** "But look at this data, pvp activity is down significantly since the blackout..." 
---
here is CCP's way of determaning gameplay changes until chaos era. they dont play the game to see if things are working, or are fun, they just look at numbers. 
---
You are making the same mistake
---
The answer is not no. You might not be able to catch up in amount of raw SP but you can catch up to skills for a certain ship.
---
&gt;I don't think you have much experience in super fleets. This stuff is very obvious if you do.
---
Uninstall and reinstall the game
---
&gt; ratting in anything but a drone boat is the same effort
---
&gt; For a significant amount more effort
---
do you sometimes wonder why people don´t take you seriously?
---
there are plenty of methods in null to up your ticks. but you actually have to play the game to do so. also yes, incursions are dumb. but that´s hardly news.
---
Exactly right. You should change. You are the problem with eve. I’m glad you noticed that. I bet you fit warp core stabs to your ships too.
---
 That's it! I've had enough of CCP and their balls. These new changes to the rorqual changes are literally an insult to every chinchilla who has doomed. I am currently unsubbing my 69 accounts. I hope you're happy CCP you have ruined the game for C4 wormholers! Goodbye forever poopoohead CCP! I hope your fuck game subtracts!
---
 Where can I find the autopiloting freighters in nullsec?
---
If you're still here and not playing the game you've not won it. You lost. Winning means quitting the game and not lurking on a forum about it 9 years later.
---
still a good thing for the game, now they try to break umbrella hope the cyno nerf gonna help, then they probably gonna increase the ratting reward with all those new risk
---
cause instead of burn jita nullsec unites to find Hilmar's WH und starts burn all WH's?
---
Dude, wtf? You know the first rule...
---
Nice try, CCP, nice try
---
I would guess that their biggest drawback is the fact its a couple of years of training and many billions of isk... It should stomp the shit out of your risk averse nano gang.
---
When I go hunting, I always end up fighting pvpers rather than their npcers, I think it’s the same for a lot of people.
---
Thanks and yes this is what I meant. It serves no purpose for a small gang at all because they won't have capitals they are willing to use anyway. And they won't have the manpower to dedicated multiple toons to this where as larger groups will have both isk and manpower available to make us of this.
---
At the same time very large fights wont benefit either because it will still die.
---
Titan down! Love it!  Destructioooonnnn.
---
That’s how blue donuts start. CCP should nerf friends to make solo great again.
---
What's confusing you there?
---
I think the only thing about the cyno change that bothers me is singleton moving caps and losing a bunch of recons. I'd love it if they would let them be on T1 cruisers and below but have them spool up for a minute or two (plenty of time for your gang to kill him first and stop a drop). The spool time could then be bonused out for the T-2 ships they select.
---
Aside from that, though? I'm pretty happy with it. I'll still drop my dread or carrier in defense fleets since I'm not paying for the lost recons but I wouldn't be tied to losing a couple of 200-300 Mil ISK ships going two jumps (on top of fuel cost).
---
I'm happy to be mostly free of caps. Now can you guys roam some brawlers through ESO this weekend? The ONIs are nice but let's truly bring back some of the fun fights of yore. Garmon Ruptures would be a blast to face off against.
---
Your Corp mate missed the point of the change.
---
no u
---
Hahahahaha you’re so new to the game it’s so funny. This is a troll post right? It has to be. Am I getting trolled?
---
This pretty much.
---
The change will increase reaction time of bigger blobs a bit when something gets ganked or any other fast reaction counterplay pvp related. This is a very good thing and it will drive small scale pvp fights, roams and ganks. The blops wont care to much to throw cyno Recons around like Ammo. SRPd. eez.
---
The effects on JFing is prolly fine.
---
For ppl that use caps in small scale scenarios e.g. for prepared gank ops in hostile terriority, mini deployments in hostile terriority and especially wormholes this is a big QoL set back.
---
When moving (and buying) caps through lowsec you will loose alot of isk just by welping cynos when moving like a bunch of dreads for a op you are organising. The argument to organise a defense fleet for the cynos is retarded sorry.
---
When you move your super deep in hostile NS or a bridging Titan which you gonna use for bridging onto scouted targets from a WH connection you basicly always initiate self destruct on the cyno ship, light on the final SD seconds and jump to it so the cyno only a warpable for a few seconds. So thats -1 recon ship.
---
When you combat jump your gank super you usually shot the cyno after jump so you are not warpable. -1 recon ship.
---
Ye also fuck moving caps in and out of WH chains.
---
One might say this is worth it or mandatory to waste the isk for these activites like described but in the end these activities are already pretty risky, ISK intensive and very very tedious to setup for the small guy. If implemented like suggested than more small scale content creators will have an even harder time to do what they do. Will eventually lead to less activity and content related. Not happy with this change overall. Also it feels like a big buff to NS blobs cause Ansiblex Gates and Bridges now exist. Feels like no one at CCP thought about those.
---
TLDR wasting force recon on combat drop may be fine but wasting force recons on all the logistics before and after for smaller scale ops is going to be aids. Also Ansiblex Bullshit pls nerf.
---
Don't fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
All titans and supers owned by pilots in an alliance with more than 2500 people should be locked into a my little pony skin.
---
&gt; EDIT: man you guys can be insanely judgemental based on very little context about who I am and how I played the game.
---
Whoa, whoa. EVE players being judgmental? Naw.
---
Well at least sightseeing is more entertaining than losing hurricanes in caldari plexus. You should try ganking some of those mining barges.
---
*carnival theme lightly in background*
---
CHAOS, CHAOS!
---
&gt;Who said we weren't. Nobody was crying also
---
The salty posts crying for everything that isn't a very specific playstyle to be nerfed say otherwise. 
---
&gt;All we hear is risk averse people crying over every little change that affects their safe gameplay
---
What about the risk averse ones who can't do anything without a t3C or recon and a cloak? Or a large number of bombers + cloaks. 
---
&gt;Try another game, eve is no longer for you.
---
Thoughtful of you, but I'm good. Keep that same energy when cloaky cancer gets nerfed though.
---
Oh there are numbers. Lots of numbers. Look at the static dump (or whatever it's called these days), or the digested form you can see in the item and ship browsers in EVEMon. Modules typically have Heat Damage and heatAbsorptionRateModifier, which I think are explained [here](http://jestertrek.blogspot.com/2011/12/guide-overheating.html). But ship hulls have a whole slough of heat-related properties: Heat Attenuation, HeatAttenuationMed, HeatAttenuationLow, heatCapacity(Hi|Med|Low), heatDissapationRate(Hi|Med|Low), and heatGenerationMultiplier. I was really hoping to find someone who knows what those do.
---
&gt; Also, check the HP on modules, for example a medium turret will have more HP than a light turret and will take longer to burn out.
---
Alas, it is not so. For example, all of Light Neutron Blaster I, Heavy Neutron Blaster I, and Neutron Blaster Cannon I have 40 HP. In fact I think *every* module I've looked at so far has 40 HP. Even capital modules.
---
What *does* differ (slightly) according to size is the module's Heat Damage property, which is 0.8 for both the small and medium blasters but 0.9 for the large one. heatAbsorptionRateModifier is 0.1 for all of the T1 versions but 0.2 for the T2 ones, which I take to mean that T2 mods are more susceptible to being damaged by heat from adjacent overheated mods.
---
How many big WH alliances have been evicted in the past 2.5 years?
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I think you forgot the part where they get evicted
---
&gt; This does not address the 'issue' at all
---
What is the 'issue' from your perspective?
---
You should not. Either get the help of a corp mate, or just quit the game. This is a MMO. Go play Homeworld or something.   
---
I literally can't collect any more salt. Somebody please make them stop crying. This is getting out of hands.
---
&gt; officer fit leshaks
---
That is when you bring out the ganking alts, right? If they lose a bunch of officer-fit ships they'll probably stand down and you'll be able to run uncontested.
---
You say "because bots" sarcastically but you've clearly never seen some of these areas of highsec.
---
Shit was crazy. Distribution bots especially.
---
I was about to finally quit for good and came back because I saw they were starting to change things.  I doubt it’ll run people away.
---
You dumb boy.
---
Think about it this way. A poor mans 40 man alliance can barely field 15-20 subs. Maybe 5-10 caps. This is not reasonable for them for any reason. For someone with 500+ people, and hundreds of dread alts, this makes sense. They have isk and srp money to spare, and wouldn't notice 5 accounts or whatever dedicated to this cyno.
---
Huge alliances won't use it unless as a cloaked on grid cyno for rorq saving. In a large scale battle it's useless, it just dies. 
---
There are situations where this has its uses. Midlevel 50-150 per side fleet fights is what I'm thinking, or cloaked on grid with rorquals more likely
---
Logic man. Be careful there.
---
. . . maybe caps weren't supposed to be single player solo objects?
---
Injectors don't need to be removed imo, they just need to change how the granted skill points are allowed to be used, injectors are a great way for newer players to catch up and invest in a lot of base skills needed using excess isk that they have lying around, for example my characters about 5 months old, I recently used a large skill injector (The only one I've been able to afford this month) to learn Energy Grid Upgrades from 4 to 5, not a bad investment or use of a skill injector if you ask me. Perhaps I'm wrong though and they do need to be removed, I wasn't arround when they were introduced to see the effects they had on the game.
---
Oh, I'm aware. They should, however, be removed from both capitals AND small ships. It makes no sense to have it on a 1m ship
---
... or just realize that the super-umbrella meta is now dead. Accept it.. shhhh. shhhhhhhhh. just follow Alex's orders this week when you are told to unsub and biomass after Keepstar Suicides.
---
Yeah. And now people buy injectors. So that cost gets factored into the price of the toon. And prices have inflated dramatically.
---
but this isn't going to help
---
give us conflict drivers. they took away all reasons to fight over sov... between moons and fozziesov...
---
Mega alliances will be fine.
---
They aren't really a problem for Ccp. It generates them a lot of real money.
---
Citadels
---
Fozzie sov
---
Delve
---
These are serious problems always seeming to escape nerfs and changes. That's because CCP does want to disturb either one
---
The shit fleets will disband the elite pve players will get paid natural selection
---
I just trained my alt into cyno 5 as a hunter for my blops, #winning
---
Do we know how much of CCP's income is subs, cosmetics, injectors, etc?
---
Maybe they kinda just forgot to think about this at all in the beginning, eve is a relatively old game.  
---
Later on people made their alts, multiboxed, and ccp realized theres money to be had, dunno.  
---
I know that some mmos that are more modern outright disallow multiboxing, or impose restrictions what you can and cannot do.
---
Actually, this is too easy.not to reply to.
---
&gt;Don't fool yourself. Most titan "fights" you have titans shooting at FAX machines and dreads until one side decides they don't want to bring more FAX and clears out.
---
&gt;I challenge you to find a fight on zkill where that wasn't the case.
---
Any Titan brawl, but using UALX as an example, we were DD volleying Titans with Titans, and dreadbombed the Tri Faxes.
---
&gt;About you having zero chance of winning: You can clear the enemy in-cyno, which also is just a recon or blops and catch bumping titans and supers while keeping them from lighting new recon cynos
---
Again, the context here is one side is already on grid. Amazingly enough, most fights work like that.  You're going to have a hard time getting anything on grid, because of the squishy cyno and warp issues I've covered extensive, so the side already in grid won't need a second cyno.
---
&gt;Ofc, if you let the enemy set up a nice titan/super blob with FAX, all you can do is clear out the FAX with dread bombs
---
Dread bombs you can't get in grid...
---
&gt;subcapitals
---
Lol. Go kill a bunch of faxes, with supercarrier support, and let me know how that goes.
---
&gt;Or stay docked and cry on reddit.
---
Or just deal with it the same way I felt with Phoebe, unsub until CCP comes up with a more reasonable iteration.
---
Or try to get this issue addressed now, which is what I've chosen to do.
---
:o I have no idea what you mean, offline 1600 plate oneiros are definitely the meta!
---
This is Eve, it's never just two lines.
---
Where do you think those PvP ships that you fly come from? Don't complain when the prices of your favorite ships rise and rise.
---
That’s honestly a good question I really have no idea. Only been in wormholes myself for a little less than a year. I’ve spent most of my eve career in small null alliances. I think maybe one or two though but that’s mostly a guess
---
Way to run away from a discussion.
---
So alphas won't be able to compete basically.
---
And have fuck all decent income so will need to Plex or quit.
---
No, they bought a company that runs one of the oldest and most notorious MMOs ever made, and all of the institutional knowledge and employee expertise that comes with it.
---
I highly doubt that Pearl Abyss cares about Eve beyond that adding us to their portfolio is a nice bonus. That's why I'm never going to believe these idiotic threads. They care about building the next big game, pure and simple, and from that perspective they think there's value in CCP's staff experience, trade secrets, and institutional knowledge.
---
This was a SUPER fun fight!
---
Well then, they can correct it by reverting every change that occurred under that loopy cunt ccp seagull.
---
Ok.

I don't understand the point of your comment. This could probably be improved, I took literally 20 seconds.
---
Honestly if you want to show CCP how you feel, stop spending money with them and stop logging in, that's the only way to protest all these asinine changes.
---
But bots tend to orca mine, not run L4 security missions.
---
Step 1: Bridge in your gank fleet ontop of the rorq/super, blops or standard cyno, doesn't really matter.
---
Step 2: Reinforcements are summoned on TS by the super/rorq pilot (the enemy is aware of you at this stage)
---
Step 3: Bridge in your sabre at the second cyno.
---
So nah, everyone was already aware before you brought in the sabre, lighting the cyno on grid and bridging the sabre is preferably done right as the harpies are taking their own bridge to the cyno gen - so the rorqual/super pilot has only a few seconds to warn them of the trap.
---
Low sec??
---
Uh, what?  
---
You never answered my question, so I let it go.
---
The Hecate is a brilliant solo ship, but due to the fact that you are flying in a gang you can take bigger ships.  Take a Sabre and a stiletto for tackle. For the firepower, 2x ONI/Syfi plus a hyperspatial Brutix would work.
---
I bet he owns  Force Recon Ships and Black Ops Battleships bpos too
---
Notably, limited/depleting resources is one of the ideas CCP has been vocally kicking around recently. I hope they do a good job with that.
---
Ignore sp total dismissing returns, and just have the skill difficulty be the inject ratio.  
---
New players can inject a 1x skill no issues, but your 14x cap skill? well that injector only gives ~35k sp
---
Suggest just uninstall 
---
Profit
---
Incursions are ment to be end game pve content alphas should not be doing them and incursion communities keep track of player activity to get players to upgrade ships and weapons to tech 2, I think you are a sponge looking to just get low effort isk

Although the neut is unnecessary imo. Like I said, these have untapped potential as pure cynobricks. We just didn't do it before because there were better options, ehp/isk wise.
---
hmmm, it does ? And with good reprocess skill, you can even get more isk
---
dont all wormholers start like that?
---
&gt;If someone is hunting, I'm sure they'll bring a bomber or force recon along to make sure they can escalate.
---
And the response fleet will alpha it before anything else.
---
Covert cyno on the bomber -&gt; bomber primaried and dies (remember, it can't move with cyno lit)
---
Let's say they suck and don't manage to kill the bomber.
---
in comes recon -&gt; primaried and dies.
---
Yep, injectors need rework.    
---
Like if you inject basic skills you get 100%       
---
But if you inject end game stuff you get 5% , NO MATTER HOW MANY SP YOU HAVE.       
---
Like who cares if a 200mil SP guy injects a frigate V ... but if 500k sp char injects capital stuff ... well something is wrong.
---
Running a fleet later, can you bring your Drake?
---
which is stupid :/ To each its own. If people want to pay real money to avoid grind, fine by me. If people wants to grind, fine by me too.
---
I personnaly have fond memories of running incursions or corp mining ops (group krabing best krabing)
---
Try that in highsec now. I dare you. We'll see how long it takes for the Triglavian recon frigs to destroy your orca.
---
&gt;forgets that rorq SMB can only carry industrial and mining ships.
---
Posting again :          
---
Yep, injectors need rework.
---
Like if you inject basic skills you get 100%
---
But if you inject end game stuff you get 5% , NO MATTER HOW MANY SP YOU HAVE.
---
Not sure I agree 100% with all your points, but they're coherently argued.  I definitely agree with the Anisblex BS though.
---
Nobody said anything about cloak. Im fine either way. Cute for you to assume i am rooting for one sided change though. You are a sob fucktard. I hope you keep on playing this game that makes you miserable. It is fun to watch you retards reeeeeee all the time. Byeee
---
Remember when dreads were as "rare" as titans are today? 
---
The problem is that we have gotten more and more efficient at producing (this includes the gathering of the resources, now with lots of rorquals that simply have unparalleled efficiency when multiboxed, in terms of ore mined per minute you spend online). While the cost of ships have not changed, and the ability of ships have not changed so n+1 is always the goal as opposed to building a "better" ship. 
---
Its like if we built a volvo 240, a good car no doubt, but not the best in the world, and then we just kept building the same thing, at ever increasing efficiency, until we literally fill the roads with it across the globe. Whereas people used to use bicycles and feet. We'd put 7 billion cars on the road A LOT quicker if we did this, compared to how we now currently improve on the models every few years, thus increasing the cost and complexity of each car, to sell people another car to replace the one they already own (not to mention, Eve has no problems with your existing titan blowing up the day after the warranty expires, like a car). 
---
And now we have a thousand titans on just one side of the doughnut. And everyone who build one titan will build the next titan slightly more efficiently in slightly less time, and then the third is built with even less effort, and the fourth with even less effort. And same goes with building titan characters. The first titan character was probably  trained willy nilly with bad remaps and such, which took years. The second was maybe trained with MCTs with a decent map plan, while still being used for something else while it trained (so it didn't train THE most efficient route). Then the third titan alt was trained with accelerators and perfect skill plans and the +5 implants were plugged in day one with account referral code SP for the implant skill. 
---
Then the fourth titan alt was injected with profits from 250bn+ in liquid assets that is churned through reactions, t2 industry and trade, for a constant 20% profit every month. So now he can make a new titan alt three times a year (or he can get two new titan alts and one new fitted titan for each of them, every single year). 
---
If CCP had not fired their economist-guy, then they would have increased the cost of titans (and their ability, lets say DD cooldown), as well as other capitals (and their abilities, so dreads would be more deadly now than five years ago). then our increased efficiency at which we accumulate more capitals, would be soaked up by increased cost and capacity, so the rate of new titans and capitals would not become exponential (from a little over 400 to over 1000 in the last year, on the goon side, so we built titans and characters over fifteen times more efficiently than the previous fifteen years).
---
&gt;Under the new rules fewer will complain.  I promise.
---
Do not make promises you know are false.
---
The first rule of Cloaking V is don't train Cloaking V
---
Have you checked task manager if the launcher is "running"? i have had it bug out and fail to start/stop and had to end the process. Have you rebooted? Did you install eve via steam?
---
We have the manpower and isk to make this work.
---
We just don't care to use caps.
---
I don't think injectors are necessarily the problem. They didn't *lead* to the problems with Roquals, FAXes, Anoms, carrier ratting, etcetc.
---
What did injectors do? They allowed pilots to train into certain ships very much faster than they normally would have. That's all injectors did. They don't affect ship attributes or anything like that. They simply accelerated the time it took to get to where we are (with Rorquals etcetc).
---
So here's the thing:
---
We got to where we are a few years ahead of schedule. And where we are is broken and unhealthy. All skill injectors did was allow us to see the issue a few years sooner. They didn't create the problem, they just accelerated. We would have arrived here regardless.
---
Deleting injectors would have just delayed the inevitable.
---
So now CCP sees, a few years sooner than expected, the problems with certain areas of the game. And since CCP works slow, they're kind of struggling to catch up.
---
But I remember when I started playing EVE, there were broken things and ship imbalances all over and CCP never blinked an eye at it. Then something changed and suddenly they started really working on the game and balancing things. So count your blessings.
---
Agreed. I do AFK-mine in a venture while at work as well. You barely make any money, but isk is isk :)
---
Everyone's a bot my friend.l
---
Because they can take you in, and then can take you out.
---
damn those 300mil recons are to expensive to support a super or titan
---
disallow more than one instance of the game to run on a computer :P
---
(and no, i don't see that happening, it makes them too much money to let ppl have a ton of industry and cyno and whatnot accounts)
---
That's true, but Hilmar has been talking a lot about resource scarcity and regional resources (vaguely) so I wouldn't be surprised if that happens one way or another before the end of the year.
---
Not every change is aimed to fix all problems, the blackout and cyno changes seems to be aimed at safety of isk making activities in nullsec (main isk faucet for the past years) and to force proyection / battle escalations and easy hauling, respectively.
---
I agree with you, Sov warefare needs a complete rework, and moon mining needs at least to be looked at again and maybe patched a little.
---
You mean when the primary money making resource for new players that have moved to nullsec goes away?  Even if the newbies aren't the ones ratting they're usually the ones doing salvaging.
---
One of my friends has been baited into a bubble outside a pos by warping to a cyno
---
Literally no one:
---
This guy: but don't you have to train cloak V
---
&gt;Rich will become richer, poor will be having even bigger issue
---
That's just life ... in the RL, too. It will be far too late before anyone realizes that these cyno changes just made big blocs stronger.
---
Sure, but the belief that CCP is making changes solely for injector sales purchases is predicated on the idea that all these changes are predicated solely on injector sales. Which I think is pretty clearly not the case.
---
Take the cyno changes: Supercap umbrellas are making whaling impossible, and shutting down any chance of a fight. The best fight most of us have had, are when we're fighting for a super or carrier kill, and a subcap support fleet shows up. Those just flat out dont happen anymore. I dont think this change will actually fix that, but that's not really my point.
---
Or the repeated Rorq nerfs, which again, I'll point to the titans that cost less than supers did not even two years ago.
---
Changes will happen, yes some (if not most) will be coordinated with injector sales. That's how a bussiness works. But the changes being based on sales targets rather than game design goals isnt what's happening.
---
Golly....almost like you'd use another ship in that situation.  But you'd be able to use a Marauder in a fleet fight instead of the recons/blops that die almost instantly.
---
Its called pay to win and the gaming industry as a whole clearly adopts this new method. CCP is just catching up because at the end of the day they are a company and companies need to show profit. They recently got bought and any mew owner wants to see ROI as fast as possible. So it was bound to happen sooner or later. Only thing to focus on is “Adapt or Die.” Simple as that..  Anything else is good ‘ol Reeeeeeeeeeeee... :)
---
I think you are unfamiliar with bots in this game.
---
Bots do not tend to Orca mine. Orca mining is an activity that is pointless to bot. If you spread drones in a 0.5 system you can walk away for an hour or two without mining stopping. There is no real gain from botting an Orca.
---
Bots do tend to *Venture* mine. Ventures are lucrative because unlike orca and barge omegas, venture alphas have virtually zero overhead and therefore the highest potential return on investment when scaled. Using virtual machines to multibox alpha venture bot swarms is a thing.
---
with \~2m sp per month from training alone, you'd have made 24m sp per year, so you \*should\* be around 70m sp \*without\* injectors
---
&gt;Strange, my bank account indicates that I've been paying 15-20 dollars per month for this free thing.
---
So what you're saying is, you didn't get an extra charge for any of the expansions?
---
So you're baiting....for Snuff.
---
If you really need to insert your cyno somewhere its much safer to bridge a recon through a blops and cyno than it is to jump the blops and cyno.
---
I get the argument if you dont have enough people but that's a pretty flimsy justification for making your billion isk null a pinata for 10 minutes
---
!!Warning!! This post contains above the daily dose of Sodium! Read at your own risk!
---
Now highsec gets to join in on the drifter fun.
---
&gt;all injectors are doing is making core game flaws more obvious
---
You got downvoted but you're absolutely right. The problems where there, skill injectors just made us get to a place where we could see them sooner.
---
Like Titans. Titans were fucking broken. Then they started to proliferate and CCP was like "whoa wait ok..."
---
I bow to your sacrifice of Karma in the pursuit of enlightening the spodbrains. But such an endeavor is folly
---
&gt;How would it be if you had to rely on other players more instead of alts.
---
Lots of niche playstyles would die.
---
There'd be less people living in WHs. Imagine logging in and not being able to do anything cuz you have no alts and no one is online.
---
I think you mean **Bitchriding**
---
For large super brawls, they aren't going to happen. Your blackops or recon will be dead before you can jump in your fleet.
---
yeah this is true, they are wonderful in WHs aswell
---
Lol that would honestly be super fun.
---
Not directly.
---
You could build a database based on when they become vulnerable and/or reinforced.
---
A lot of us actually view that as a great thing. Forcing people into lower class ships for PvP simply due to cost helps to make PvP more fun and interesting and losses more meaningful. I'd way rather see more T1 cruisers than macharials and HAW dreads.
---
Haha lol true.
---
Seems like a good middle ground. Or just make diminishing returns even bigger. If they are really there to help new player catch up why can a player with any amount of SP use them? I know the answer is CCP makes more money that way but maybe add a next lvl where you only get like 25000sp per injector
---
You are correct but missed the point.
---
Yes. That is why we don't use recons. Because there are better options both absolute and relative to price.
---
My argument is that recons are currently regarded as a very squishy ship; however, that's not necessarily true that they are squishy, and once we *remove* those other options by taking away their cyno abilities then there is reason in fact to make brick tank cyno recons; it's not stupid anymore. 100k ehp recon cynos *will* be a thing.
---
Thanks for at least checking the numbers first.
---
...
---
WE MUST REDISTRIBUTE THE SP TO THE WORKING CLASS. THE TOP ONE PERCENT OF ONE PERCENT HAS TOO MUCH WEALTH AND SP, AND IT IS NOT FAIR TO HARD WORKING EMPERYONS

They lead to this problem.       
---
For over over 10 years this was not a problem until you could have a specific char in 1 day.        
---
People didn't want wait 3 years to get such char ... but if you can have it in one day ... but it will cost you - guess what we have people that injected like 10-20 rorqual chars, supers , titans - something that they didn't consider training for years.
---
All you have to do, is get a destroyer or frigate, a few friends, go into null.
---
Then find a cyno being lit and kill the idiot how thought he could get away with it.
---
If you want to stop people from getting richer, STOP THEM.
---
catalysts or coercers, maybe thrashers
---
You will have power progression and not all equipment or skills are available to you. It's better to think of alpha as an indefinite trial mode than a main wait to play. You absolutely can play as alpha only, and people do, but *generally* if eve gets it's hooks into you, they go deep
---
Yeah only the people that hate spontaneous pvp are really whining
---
Yeah in retrospect those numbers are possible on a not absurd Redeemer, the other four don't really see those kind of numbers with viable fits though.
---
Unless you're one of the choke points next to HS, lighting a cyno not next to a station might be an option.
---
No. Go get a real ship and stop relying on cheap tricks to win your engagements.
---
&gt;They lead to this problem.
---
They lead to this problem happening *now*, instead of in 2021.
---
The flaw in your logic is when someone is embracing change, there isn't a limit to that.  Which means they can happily embrace the change of a different game.
---
&gt;Skill a frigate or a cruiser. Dock up that capital and head out into the deep unknown. You'll get more out of this game then you think
---
Did it years ago.  Didn't find it as fun.  You and CCP have told me "fuck off, you're playing the game wrong".  So I am.
---
He prefers lighting a cyno to kill an interceptor then sniffing about a killmarks
---
covert ops subsystems are defensive and dont have much tank at all
---
Well, thats your problem right there.
---
Na it doesnt.
---
Bots dont need PLEX, yet another misconception. VNI bots are alpha, only super bots needed PLEX. 
---
None of these drove up the price as much as you think. You know who did? Your dear CSM rep Olmeca with his 200 accounts skillfarm. That drove up prices, i.e., SP.
---
no this is a pay2win game so pay up
---
The only good thing to come from BOSS
---
People have crunched zkill numbers already. And they say its down. Activity is down all across the board, check dotlan. Do with it what you want.
---
Ignore this guy btw. He's having a temper tantrum that CCP is knocking over the sandcastle someone built for him.
---
Lol says a guy that just kills new players all day in easy land
---
Provi resident.  I'm probably not alone in the fact I'm currently PvPing with the ships I have left in my hanger, but I no longer have ways to make easy ISK, so I'm not making any ISK.  I have some ISK in my wallet, but not sure what will happen when that runs out.
---
It's not impossible to make ISK, but it's less efficient than it used to be, and I suspect the full impact of the blackout is yet to be felt.
---
BTW - never heard leadership tell me (or anyone else) to go to Highsec.
---
i could easier see them implement injector withdrawal - the longer you go without using an injector, the faster you lose skills. if you never used an injector by the time they implement this, you char will get reset to starting skill levels
---
covops with covert cyno exists you know...
---
But if I'm alpha, eventually I get to the wall, and the only way to pass it is by going Omega, right?
---
Nope, I'm saying we get a lot of small to medium gang skirmishes in Providence against TRC &amp; friends when Templis aren't just dropping HAW dreads on frigates. Now I just need a 200km warpto at every gate to shoot their recon with multiboxed rail Tengus every time they drop one.
---
"Provi blobs" is a lazy response, ofc if you go to a staging system everyone on intel will want in on the killmail?
---
Yes. So does the ticker.
---
Scanmer alts*
---
i only once used injector - to inject a holder for my hel.    
---
Situation forced me *aka war.          
---
This was just basic carrier skill and like 3mil sp in jump skills.         
---
I have atm 3 titans, 1 in build, 4 supers and unknown number of capitals.            
---
I can field mix any of those 4 ships at a time.        
---
I have 6 chars with recons (on same accounts)         
---
I can be considered as a "rich guy" even if i don't feel as one - i worked on all this stuff around 10 years.          
---
While i will be affected it will be minimal as i have skills and ships already.                 
---
But Christ CCP you are saying that only recons are be able to light cyno - so what big people that are missing this skills will just inject, while small players will just be stomped by this change.            
---
This is one of the dumbest moves - not because capitals will be not able to fit cyno - but because if you have cloacked alt in a recon ... and like 2 people in your corp have the same in the system.........   **LIKE WHO CARES** ...
---
If new players getting into Caps is a problem that means Caps are too powerful. CCP created them to be overpowered because they were so hard to get into. Now they're not hard to get into, that means they shouldn't be so powerful.
---
And yes. I get that they might already not be as powerful as they used to be but if there's still a problem that more people get into them, they're still too powerful.
---
PL cant punch above their size the same way as before because they didn't adapt when the meta changed. When a strategy no longer work, you need to change to a new strategy that works. That's what the Imperium did, what Test and frat have done/are doing and that is what panfam will need to do to stay relevant.
---
These new changes and nerfs that CCP seems to be doing is trying to treat an illness by treating the symptoms, not the underlying problems. Removing injectors are the same thing. Injectors aren't the problem, it's how easy it is to multibox high resource (be it isk or ore) yielding
---
ships. Don't nerf the VNI, nerf ratting (I personally like the VNI change but it didn't solve anything). People who multiboxed in VNIs can just switch to Myrms or Domis and continue doing what they're doing. Don't nerf the rorquals yield (though that might've been needed too), nerf the ability to use 10 of them at the same time.
---
Also, multiboxing in general isn't the problem either, it's that you can so easily scale up the resource generation. If you can multibox 10 Hulks at the same time that'd bring you a lot of resources too but it would require so much micro managing that few would do it. How many people are multiboxing 10 ratting carriers for example?
---
I've wanted ECM to do this forever.  Remove brackets and overview and unlock all targets, but still be able to lock targets manually if you can find them in space.
---
I've definitely had an error where my ship was going too fast to do the safe logoff. It technically doesn't have to be stopped, but I dunno where the speed threshold is.
---
In terms of skillpoints, yes but by the time you get there you'll most likely know whether going omega is worth it to you or not.
---
yes like read about this in this topic 14 bomber hulls per trip.
---
Yes, but that's being omega all the time which at times either I couldn't afford or didn't see the point of paying (taking a break/beeing busy with IRL)
---
Yeah after I posted the question, I found [this post](http://jestertrek.blogspot.com/2011/12/guide-overheating.html). Which has part of what I was hoping to find.
---
t2 BPOs anyone?
---
If its LS sabre wont do much besides normal scram tackle though, gotta say this just incase, people somehow still think bubbles work in ls
---
wrong, people that play games don't consider they will be playing them in next year ... or 3.        
---
If something is 3 years from now they will simply skip it.
---
Don't listen to the salty goonie. Game is as far from pay to win as it gets. You can be useful from day one.
---
If one of your alts is in a Recon, that's one less alt in a Rorqual.
---
Can it still be tankier than a recon? If so, it seems they are too tanky. If not, why do you want it?
---
Yes, new players dont need access to them to "catch up".
---
Injecors are great for CCP, first they eliminate an underground service, yeah they don't have to moderate it, but it still costs them time and resources  to deal with the consequences of it. Second, by providing a legit way to do it in-game it allows themselves to make money off it (extractor sales). Third, I know it sounds like a crazy idea, but CCP may just a little bit care if people in their playerbase are getting scammed out of real money.
---
Ay, ain't a sub like 2b? 3.8mil/PLEX need 500 for 30 day sub
---
The ticker?
---
The idea is to have toon selling instead of injectors.
---
&gt;I'd rather just park my capitals and only bring them out when the alliance needs them for something... and provides the cyno for me.  #Eve2019 #CCP!
---
You realize this is what we want, right? For capital projection to be something that's done for large scale strategic benefit and not for the lulz?
---
My corp has 14 real people, this change will not prevent us from using caps when we want to use caps, but it will reduce our willingness to YOLO them around on small roaming groups.
---
Honest question, wouldn't the removal of injectors lead to
---
A.) Rich players just buying characters thus not really solving the problem?
---
And
---
B.) Just delay the real issues? Like if it takes say 30 days to train into force recons, and everyone made a force recon account the day of the patch, wouldn't that just mean we would have the same umbrella issue just 30 days down the line as opposed to instantly?
---
About fucking time you came back bro, holy shit 9 years..........
---
Yes
---
Says who? You? That's a specious argument. If that was true we wouldn't have started having problems with Titans and Supercarriers *before* skill injectors became a thing. "Super proliferation" has a problem being discussed a lot before injectors shipped.
---
Let me make this a little simpler:
---
Nicotine accelerates tumor growth (via promotion of angiogenesis).
---
Let's say someone has cancer. They don't use nicotine and will die in 2 years without treatment.
---
Now let's say they start vaping. The nicotine accelerates the cancer and they will now die in 6 months without treatment.
---
What's the *real* problem? The nicotine, or the cancer?
---
Always be cloaked?
---
&gt; LIKE WHO CARES
---
It looks like you do care very much about this.
---
&gt; People were creating farms, but they were not cheap. You need to keep them subbed, so you're paying 15$/month to create your Rorqual char to sell.
---
Did not thought about it, yes, it was harder then.
---
&gt;That's true and that's why people say that injectors broke the game. Caps were in a good place before injectors and they're in a bad place now.
---
Are you sure it's injectors work, not just time? People learning skills with time, so now there's a lot of people with cap.skills. There's more then could be without injectors, but I do not think that there'd be dramatic difference.
---
&gt;Right now, I can inject them for free and keep them subbed for free.
---
Well, not for free, but yes, there's difference. But still, rorq pilots would be bulk grown and sold. It's rorq that was not balance, and it was addressed multiple times for now.
---
&gt;You can fly a 4-5 bil Gila and farm T4/5, but you first need to accumulate 4-5 bil and get the skills required to fly that Gila.
---
4-5b Gila sounds like a lot of overkill, but I am not up to devote 10-20h to prove this. (or not prove)
---
&gt; Back then, You could run incursions with 500mil Maelstorm and get that 1bil for PLEX in 10 hours.
---
Well, I guess Maelstorm does not require all that skills and dedicated leveling that you mentioned for Gila, ye?
---
&gt;Do you really need to catch up though?
---
Well, I did. I watched some PvP videos and streams and decided that I want not only trade, but shoot things too. At moment I had like none combat skills). Yes, I could quickly get some frig/dessie/cruiser skills and be weak part of some fleet, but I did not want to mash F1, I wanted to fight against some fleet in small-scale.
---
(not like it was only option, and yes, I could do "normal" path, but Injectors allowed me to do it faster, which I like)
---
&gt;Or, even better, a good tackle frigate within 1 day.
---
Good to tackle what? I have no idea what could 1 day trained frigate tackle... Sleeping Venture?
---
&gt;You can easily use 3 alts at once to farm or pvp (that's my standard setup). That's more than what a newbro can do.
---
Well, I do use 2 alts, and still kind of newbro. What am I doing wrong?
---
&gt;I'm currently growing my setup to farm with 6 chars at once (and probably moving to Rorqs after this).
---
Yepp, and this Rorqs will have to keep Recon as cyno, and this cyno could be killed now. So your 6 Rorqs is getting kind of vulnerable a bit.
---
&gt;By the time that you can get 3 farming alts, I'll be on Rorqs
---
And what? Lets assume I have 3 farming alts, you have 10 Rorqs. What advantage does this give to you over me? You can spend more on ships? Well, we both know that one blingy ship is still get killed by 2-3 t2 ships. Not to mention that you have to fly this 10 Rorqs and protecting them is going to be more difficult.
---
&gt;On a side-note, rorqs under a super umbrella (especially 10 Rorqs) are actually very hard to remove off the field because of the PANIC module.
---
Yep, but they get a little more vulnerable when the got no cyno in fit. It's not dramatic change, but it shifts balance a bit in direction I like.
---
&gt; remove whspace
---
No. That would be horrible. Fuck Off
---
I think what he's saying is, not necessarily: some people are in caps *only because they could inject*, and if they couldn't inject they would never have had the patience to train them on wall-clock time.
---
Which is not obviously true, but it seems plausible to me that if CCP hadn't provided something that looks (to a casual) like a "win" button, casuals wouldn't have tried to push it.
---
Probably by using multiple ships fitted with a cyno and being quick about jumping to cyno(s) once lit.
---
No one would even buy them then and that means no Plex being purchased
---
Or potentially just decloak the recon next to him -- part of the issue, but still an improvement.
---
Cyno changes address exactly the issue i was talking about. Ccp is on my side. Grow up and learn how discussions work. I’m not your mommy and have to put up with your tantrums.
---
Lorenzo, you're just shit posting now. Step away.
---
Only 2 more accounts? Cool that'll put me at 6 accounts that I'm trying to box at once.
---
Really? I can think of dronelands, stainwagon and goos in fountain, the latter 2 were n*2 fights, we're currently seeing an n*2 with TAPI vs FRAT and it's been a pretty solid stalemate the last 6 months, with krabbing continuing for both groups..
---
So other t2 cruisers.
---
Other t2 battleships.
---
T3s, etc.
---
A weaker need doesn't inherently mean the Nerf no longer a Nerf.
---
Remove multiboxing, injectors solved. And rorqs. And cloaky camping. And botting. And supers.
---
lol have my upvote
---
We should also remove safety while docked in Citadels. No more safety while AFK!
---
&gt;Remember before capital ratting and rorquals how people made money?
---
&gt;High sec incursion alts, that's how. That's where we're regressing to.
---
errrr no?
---
Ooh, good example.
---
If the recon isnt already in place though, it can be zoned out with bubbles and otherwise controlled, and the timer is really 1 minute because of inhib.
---
In what context are you speaking?
---
Have you tried turning it off and back on?
---
(I obviously have IT experience)
---
&gt;Also, you can now gate your cap around.
---
Right? You don't *need* to jump your capital ships around. You can use conventional gates. You don't *need* an alt to scout the other side of a gate. You can go through blind.
---
The Devs are reintroducing risk to the game. That is a good thing.
---
No.  What I'm saying is that regular upkeep was an expected part of the product I paid for.  If you get warranty repair on a car it isn't free.  It's just what you paid for when you bought the car.  Regular upkeep on a monthly subscription game is integral to the product and calling it free doesn't change the reality that you did pay for it.
---
Because i trained my skills normal way and this change will don't change much if the solution is .... INJECT 1 CHAR.
---
First, most "entrance" systems are being at least scouted (when not directly camped) more often than not, and besides that even if that is a valid option not many JF pilots are willing to risk their excesively expensive ship doing that... as one of ours said on Discord yesterday "cyno on the undock or I'm not jumping". I can't blame him.
---
No, it wasn't. Half the time you'd catch 1 guy's super and his 3 titan alts would drop. That isn't working together, that's multiboxing in a broken instant-escalation meta.
---
Okay, I can concede that the problem wouldn't have been *as big* as it is currently, but the problem would still be there.
---
That's number 2, but I'm glad you know your ABC's
---
&gt; CCP created them to be overpowered because they were so hard to get into. Now they're not hard to get into, that means they shouldn't be so powerful.
---
Or... they shouldn't be easy to get into, which is the entire point of StainGuy's post. It's not just caps. You can inject into BLOPS today. You can have Marauder to 5 today, if you want.
---
Eve wasn't and shouldn't be a place where a pilot is able to get instant gratification.
---
You can disagree but the truth is many of us think the disease is eve becoming less challenging. Not just in terms of SP but in other areas as well.
---
Good man
---
When you would reinforce a pos back in the day, the timer was based on how much stront was in the tower at the timer. I think it was still somewhat random within a 4 hour window.
---
Snuffed out had a guy that would log in at any hour of the day to adjust the stront in a tower so the timer would be favorable. As soon as they got a notification, this guy would show up to adjust the stront. Every time.
---
Bombers, the current apex predator of Eve.
---
I don't think T3C's should be able to light cynos, I am excited that no cynos will be immune to bubbles with this change.
---
But... that’s the whole point? Lmao 🤣 we need skills to go to new alts alt characters that people will play and splitbox and lose ships with. Otherwise the game would stagnant and we’d lose all the alts with good skills or they would just be sold as a bundle character on shady websites that ccp doesn’t control.
---
Can't 2 bombs can kill 500 bombers if they position wrong though? This sounds terrible, but in a pretty amusing way.
---
We're allready warping Cyno Ceptors around.
---
Might be a new purpose for those ships, Bombers are shite to volley anything of the grid since their Torpedos are slow as fuck and they usually don't sit at zero under the Super.
---
If you can open a Cyno for even 10sec, thats plenty!
---
I can point to a fight I was watching in pure blind a while ago. It was Triumvirate fighting heavily outnumbered over a fort against snuff out batphoned in by French connexion and banderlogs.  I think I saw garst there too so he would of been fc, anyway they dropped in haw dreads and managed to win the fight and kill the fort, snuff didnt escalate with caps for whatever reason as surprising as that is. The FXR guys did escalate and garst wiped their caps with his own counter dread bomb. 
---
This is the niche where I'm suggesting this. Albeit I don't know how often engagements like that happen, but for alliances who like to fight outnumbered, haw dreads are what evens the odds for them to be able to stick around and stay the course of the fight.
---
Over the years I've been in fights like that one and they are the most fun I've had in this game. Ive always liked being outnumbered and tested, and admire those with play styles like that. I Dont want to see that play style crushed.
---
Because 2 &gt; 1
---
You know that without injectors there is limited number characters on the market.     
---
1. Someone need to want sell one      
---
2. Even if you buy such char ... in New Eden number of chars capable of doing something didn't changed due to this.             
---
Simple example : if you have 100 titan chars in new eden ^(i know there are more of them) if someone sells you one ... **there is still 100 titan chars in new eden**
---
Most accurate comment on this post.
---
The last time I got Plex they were a bit pricey, probably gone down some. But it still leaves most of the time to krabbing. If that's enjoyable by all means go for it
---
That's reasonable for normal cynos, since they are warpable beacons.
---
I’ll admit, I was miffed when I was running missions on one account while my alts were mining in a .7 system and then I here the “dong” and explosion and I think whaaat? Go and look and my covetor was gone and recon was floating about killing the last of its drones... reminded me not to just afk it. Went and bought that toon a proper PvE ship and a new miner. Sucks losing the ship but it’s New Eden. Ain’t nowhere safe.
---
CCP response: neuter bombers like they did ceptor fleets.
---
Infinite tackle and the ability to cyno, no thanks, I like it the way they have it, although I don't see the point of the blops being able to light regular cynos.
---
Adjust your posting tbh. Like to 0
---
It's what will become of nullsec fights sadly
---
well we warned CCP they are hitting the small organizations but o well.. we can already see that big groups are forming as a result to the changes they make. This will only get worse.
---
I am absolutely certain that cheaper plex means more players can afford them. Why would this not be true?
---
&gt;Bots dont need PLEX, yet another misconception. VNI bots are alpha, only super bots needed PLEX. 
---
There are many types of bots.
---
&gt;None of these drove up the price as much as you think. You know who did? Your dear CSM rep Olmeca with his 200 accounts skillfarm. That drove up prices, i.e., SP.
---
But now that botting is basically kept in check because no local, price goes down. Could be a coincidence, but doubtful.
---
The increase in price did not see a significant decrease in volume, so that isk was coming from somewhere and given that null is basically generating more than half of the isk, it seems safe to say a lot of it came from there.
---
I think CSM is useless.
---
&gt;Can't 2 bombs can kill 500 bombers if they position wrong though? This sounds terrible, but in a pretty amusing way.              
---
It sounds bad, will be amusing for short amount of time just to be **highly annoying for a very long time**         
---
How much time took players to persuade CCP to move away from interceptor fleets ?
---
But bombers don't need nerfs.
---
Your context?
---
It will suck for smaller groups that can't plop a dozen recons all around. It's good for CCP to nerf small gangs though, they get too many buffs and us null blocs just get ignored even though we're the biggest. Big coalitions will be fine.
---
It's actually easier. Warp in Griffin alt, jam recon, jump in carrier, warp.
---
Just like Drifters in null people will bitch about how bullshit this is and Trig recons will be less aggressive in a few days/weeks.
---
Why would they want a weaker nerf?
---
Terrible idea when they came out with them. Still suck. I get the reasons but meh short term gains for long term loss. Ahh well.
---
I've always criticized CCP because they did incremental adjustments on balance issues. There'd be a problem, so they'd change it by 5% and forget about it for six months. We might eventually arrive at a semi-balanced state, but only after literal years of putting up with godawful mechanics that everyone knew were broken. 
---
So I really appreciate them having the balls to make fundamental changes to the game's balance, meta and playstyles. They aren't gonna get everything right 100% of the time, and some of these changes will need adjustment, but I'd rather they way overshoot than not try at all. 
---
At the very least, if they utterly demolish the current meta, we'll get to enjoy figuring out a new meta for a few months before they revert a lot of the changes. It'll be different, which isn't the same as "better" but is definitely better than "the same."
---
&gt;What I'm saying is that regular upkeep was an expected part of the product I paid for.
---
Expansions aren't "upkeep" - they're new products with new features. If you want access to the new products and the new features, you have to pay for the expansion.
---
EVE expansions have always been free, and they now have the most generous trial in the industry (Alpha clones).
---
There are many games that charged for expansions, and many still do. FFXIV is one example. WoW is another. To be honest you sound very entitled and spoiled.
---
&gt;well we warned CCP they are hitting the small organizations but o well.. we can already see that big groups are forming as a result to the changes they make. This will only get worse.
---
&gt; I miss POS
---
Never thought id hear that being said
---
...seeing that you are being hunted...by a cloaky ship in blackout....seriously? 
---
Someone with half a brain would know that you need to know there is a hostile player and you would need his name to look him up on Zkill...
---
Not everyone has a ton of alts or a massive alliance with tons of players in order to guard every gate and WH to catch the name of the cloaky guy that could open a cyno and bring in unlimited (by game mechanics!) number of hostiles. And what if the dropper has half a brain and doesn´t fall for a bait?
---
If cynos would work like WHs (cyno "colapses" after a certain amount of tons came thru) or Jumpbridges (every ton that comes thru uses a certain amount of LO), it would make hotdropping still viable and more counterable. 
---
The dropper actually had to either limit the amount of ships he drops on you to a minimum in order to drop again, or get out and get more fuel. Limiting the amount of ships (mass) he can drop also creates a better chance to fight back for the victim (mostly a single ratter/miner). And the best part it wouldn´t mean perfect safety for either side!
---
Or make Cynos burn out after one use, like Capital Emergency Hull Energizer module. So he had to carry a mobile depot and spare cynos, and he (and the depot) would be visible/scannable for a short amount of time.
---
Wouldn´t that make it way more interesting for both sides?
---
why bother lying to him he will find out
---
Ok boomer
---
cute you think that
---
What?
---
Dude wtf are you even talking about?
---
but im bored
---
Provi has been on the brink of failcascading for like 10 years, who’s surprised? The provi idiots go running to safety and/or bat phone as soon as anything remotely sketch happens, it’s the natural order of things
---
I'm gonna remind you of a structure called cyno beacon
---
That's reasonable for everything, since someone good at scanning can probe down a ship and get there in seconds, with more than enough time to catch an aligning JF.
---
The ships. Are they newbie ships?
---
I think you can have injectors as they are now, but that also means you can't have ships that are flat out better than other ships. It means much more frequent balancing and no 'end game' stuff, just more options that are sometimes better, sometimes worse. 
---
The capital arms race of the last 2-3 years was disgusting, that's the only word I can find. It put a ton of pressure on people to buy injectors and PLEX more accounts just to stay relevant in null. That kind of shit can't be allowed to happen anymore no matter how good it is for CCP's bottom line, because we all see right now what happens when people (in some sense rightfully) get angry when CCP finally does step in to restore some sense of balance to the game. 
---
10% of the flyable ships in the game have absolutely shit on the other 90% for the past 3 years. That's not right, *unless you're selling injectors*.
---
Lol
---
The likelyhood that this will *actually* be the case is quite low.
---
Congratulations.
---
CONCORD Cloaking Device here I come.
---
Just want to chime in and say I agree with you. Cynos how they currently function are hugely problematic, but that doesn't mean that there isn't design space for their usage to be made more interesting in the future. Reigning them in as hard as they are right now and then potentially relaxing the restriction in some ways in the future makes *far* more sense than tightening it and then tightening it again after deciding it was too loose still. 
---
If you did the latter option, people would train into &lt;something&gt; only to have it restricted again and have their training be wasted. The way they are doing it, worst case scenario you train to Blops for cyno and then make the choice later to train to whatever new cyno ship option they decide on but it stays your choice.
---
No, I would not call Mauraders and Triglavian ships "newbie ships". But I'm open to the idea that, *in certain contexts*, they could be considered "newbie ships" for *that* playstyle. So that's why I'm asking you: in what context are you calling Mauraders and Triglavian ships "newbie ships"?
---
I agree mostly with the change but I think it's too restricted. Give it to the monitor and/or t3c
---
&gt;Let them shake up cook mechanics
---
[insert generic salt joke here]
---
&gt; or wormholes
---
drifter hole frequency was increased from the announcements
---
&gt;Unless “things” only means null.
---
they literally have entire invasions by the triglavians in hs
---
&gt;And l”null” only means pve in null 
---
til cynos and local are things used just by pve players
---
a couple of cap gun dreads and that marauder is dead very quickly.
---
I've only paid subscription (and sometimes not even that) for 2 years straight. I've never played a game for that long without getting bored.
---
But then I'd want to join a big alliance. :(
---
thx. enjoy your adventure :)
---
I don't disagree.  I'm just saying that most of the people applauding the loudest don't think about null fleet fights, nor do they care about them.  They just want go hunting in null without any significant reprisals, and/or they just want null sec to fuck off in general.
---
Personally, if caps are the real issue here, I'd have preferred they made changes that impacted how caps (and only caps) deal with cynos.  Perhaps leave regular cynos as they were, but make them only usable for titans to bridge subcap fleets to.  Then create a new cyno that capitals can jump to as well, which can only be deployed from certain ships.
---
Yes  you are just regurgitating a meme, i know its trolling but...
---
First they came for us and you memed, then they came for your friend and you memed... when they come for you will you meme? and YEEEET ?
---
Wasnt there some ex csm guy who posted saying that hilmar hasnt played eve since like 2003? Was he full of shit?
---
Yup, EVE's market is very robust and people responding extremely well to incentives.
---
If mining because extremely hazardous, minerals prices will spike and  the incentive to mine will increase. Maybe miners will pay people to guard them? Maybe more newbies will fly cheap T1 barges because the return is so good?
---
buy orders on capitals mods will be way underpriced tho.
---
Oh you sweet summer child....
---
To be honest, just running the site in a Kestrel would put most people off as it’s not worth the effort of scanning down.
---
if the main objective was to make their money back in 3-5 years they wouldn't buy a company such as ccp in the first place
---
That's the only reason we're having the helicopter caps again. Cap pilots be bored
---
I find it hilarious, CEO of a 14 person corp and we're loving the chaos. Blackout has meant more fights, and we're enjoying theorycrafting how to deal with the cyno change.
---
Cloaked shit teleporting around a region is just as much cancer as supercaps teleporting around a region. 90% of the PVP in the game should be ships taking gates, because most of the fair fights in the game happen when one side intercepts another *at a gate*. The rest is either planned (ie. a timer) or ganks. 
---
Assuming supers finally get balanced. Because until that happens it's no wonder why people only aim to gank before they get ganked.
---
In no context. I implied they were not as big a problem as caps, but they are not newbie ships and should not be injectable.
---
When you create a corportation you also have to give it a short 4-5 letter name (thematically referred to as a "ticker" after stock tickers because eve is business themed) This short name/ticker will show up in the overview and brackets.
---
So? Git gud
---
I'm not sure whether that's supposed to be bad, but if you're running multiple Rorqs all the time is it really a stretch to plex one more account?
---
I have gathered quite amount of assets all scattered over the galaxy, and a lot of items aren’t worth to be contracted.  Now, I’m planning to join a corp (after 3 years). Should I move my stuff around, and what is the most effective way? I can only move around 26k in a freighter.
---
all corps and alliance have a shorthand ticker, like a stock market ticker. KarmaFleet in Goonswarm for example is [SNOOO] &lt;CONDI&gt; (SNOOO being the corp ticker and CONDI the alliance ticker)
---
This is why a lot of big alliances have an extra character in the name, because the original was taken. &lt;NC.&gt;, &lt;INIT.&gt;, etc
---
You think that will stop CCP?
---
Shouldn’t you be focusing on a gate to stain?
---
It's chaos era bro. No more endless safe wh isk
---
No I can promise you this will get abused to shit. I mean I'll be in the fleets left right and center abusing this mechanic until CCP and dumbass Hilmar find their brain cells again. But until then I'll enjoy ruining everyone's game as always. :p
---
&gt;small gangs need a nerf
---
Low quality bait
---
Good thing we have defender missiles...
---
I really hope CCP ignores these rage threads.   Caps should be to protect whatever amount of home space you SHOULD be holding for your abilities under the new system,  or for an all in, out and out major invasion with tons of logistics.
---
No one goes pheasant hunting in a Nimitz class carrier, at least not at great cost.
---
Most people dont have a issue with *what* CCP is trying to achieve.
---
Its just the *way* they do it is just the wrong approach. The sledge hammer approach *can* work but not in this case IMO
---
I've had phantom eve window/launchers running and it caused exactly this.
---
Yeah, fuck people that have more money than time. 
---
They don't deserve to enjoy space spergs online the way they want to.
---
&gt;What does all that actually mean?
---
That Alpha is like 3-4 months of free trial.
---
Except that you can capture systems that are not adjacent to one of your own.  You could capture anything, but would have to fight the contested passive drop, which really isn't much during a siege if the defender does nothing.
---
So reinforced mode used a specific amount of stront per hour, and when stront ran out, the tower became vulnerable.
---
I don't rembember how much stront they used, but for this example, well say it's 10 stront per hour.
---
So let's say you're in Test, and USTZ is your strong TZ, and currently you're in a war with FRT, who plays in mostly AUTZ.  You expect that FRT would reinforce your towers at around 1000, and you know you can get enough dudes to defend and repair your tower at about 0000, so you would put 140 stront in your tower so that once it was reinforced, you had 14 hours before it was vulnerable, right in your prime time.  You could also put 380 (140+240) stront in, which would put the timer in your prime time the next day.
---
So the way you beat this was either (1), try to forage up enough dudes to RF a tower late in the defenders prime, which would move the timer closer to your prime, or (2) you could start RFing the tower late in your prime, then kite the tower by just doing more damage then the shield regen  until the defenders started logging in, then you would finish RFing it, to get you a timer really early in your TZ.  If someone caught you, they could change the stront level before it RFed, and that was annoying.
---
The TL;DR is towers were RFed for a set amount of time from when it was put in RF mode instead of coming out at a set time. As attackers you had options to get around TZ tanking.
---
This is not going to change the cloaky meta, just make it even more prevalent.
---
If it's in HS then any T1 destroyer really. Catalyst or Coercers are still the highest DPS for the gank though I think.
---
probably confused for 3.5 mil per plex.
---
I asked why you don't move or join a different group.  You never answered that.  I'm not throwing a tantrum.  Forgot all about it until today when you brought it back up.  
---
I'm very confused by you.  Best of luck in your future endeavors.
---
I honestly have no idea what you’re talking about Nuke.
---
&gt;What the hell is CCP doing, are they TRYING to ruin their game.
---
They've been trying for past decade dude

Why should I move? Cause something is used to do doesn’t work anymore? That’s something that happens all the time in eve.
---
&gt;They changed so there's only a single spawn in high sec, and there's a longer time between spawns, the last one was well over the 36 hours that's the usual max.
---
How long ago was this done?
---
The short "tag" that each corp has.
---
Some examples:
---
"Test Alliance Please Ignore" has TEST as ticker
---
"Curatores Veritates Alliances" has CVA as ticker
---
"Goonswarm Federation" has CONDI as ticker
---
They don't need to nerf injectors.
---
They need to remove them completely.
---
&gt;I play ~2 years, and if there was no injectors - I guess I'd just quit, since the only way to get interesting content would be buying characters.
---
&gt;edit: All this old-players complaining about injectors killing the game seems to not understand that injectors is only reasonable way for new players to catch-up.
---
Hello there.
---
I would like to address what you've said here.
---
I consider myself a "senior player", or a bittervet. I started the game in 2009, and my current main was born in 2011.

Back then, "catching up" was a common refrain among new players. And despite very much effort on the part of very many veterans to explain why this isn't actually a problem (including a very long write up by ShahFluffers), the complaint still exists.
---
Here's the thing through:
---
Players as old as me started in a time where new players literally started with dirt. You were given a Rookie ship (now known as a "Corvette") and told to go fuck yourself. You started with like 10,000 SP. And you had garbage attributes and had to train skills to increase them. They were known as "learning skills". And they were mandatory. So you had to spend over a month training attributes before you could start training skills to do things.
---
There was also basically no tutorial. You had to Google everything. There was no "Agency" to hold your hand and show you where all the content was. Career agents? I didn't even know they existed until 6 months in.
---
I started with the same dirt as everyone else. But I set goals and stuck with the game (took breaks here and there ofc) and now I'm sitting on close to 100million SP on my main (**zero** injecting) and a net worth over 100 billion.
---
CCP has done a *lot* of work improving the new player experience. The SP you start with has increased, the tutorial has improved, new hand-holding mechanics have been put in place, and now, with the Buddy Invite link, new players stat with 1 million unallocated SP. Currently, for 5 bucks, they can get another 1 million unallocated SP.
---
And still all new players do is whine, whine, whine. You have *no* idea how good you have it.
---
EVE is a goal oriented game. Set a goal and *work* for it, over time.
---
Only Titans should be able to lit cynos.
---
Since Titans are the ones creating jump bridges... it's only logicals only Titans would have the "technology" to create an exit point for such jump bridge.
---
This way whenever you want to light a cyno, you must risk a Titan.
---
How's that for space chess
---
The ecosystem is fucked, player count and subs are dropping like flies. Current Eve is only maintainable if everyone starts buying plex like crazy. Which all the current changes are pushing you towards and if you dont realize that.....now you do.
---
If you're just flying bombers because nobody wants to risk a recon for a proper cyno, that's not abusing anything. That's just being risk averse.
---
I'm not saying goku/stuka/whatever fleets are bad or anything. They might be a bit more common, but they aren't going to replace every doctrine ever because cynos are different now.
---
I don't like the idea of momentum being given to the losing side.  If you are taking systems, you should be given the feeling of a wave and others should fight back.  But the congruent bonus is cutting both ways here, so there really isn't a lopsided deal unless you put geography into action and set yourself up in a nicely surrounded system and do your best to keep your tower defenses up, or the neighboring systems that act like shields to your own system.  In the end, it's not who's losing, it's who is fighting the smartest and whoever is 'leading' will have to worry about highsec borders making the edge systems fall faster.
---
&gt;they have the best statics,
---
&gt;they have the best statics
---
Yeah it can still be tankier for sure.
---
I think that having a "hard" cyno ship isnt inherently a bad idea.  It allows for smaller groups to have a cyno that wont just get blapped off field instantly, giving time for their own caps to get in, and for larger groups they should have several force recons if their initial one dies anyway.  This just removes the cheesyness of having to bring 3 recons if you want to reliably get your capitals on grid.
---
Where the trade off between force recon and t3s comes in is that force recons would have an extremely low cycle time (1min), while t3cs would have a 5minute timer, making force recons the quicker option, but at the cost of less tank/not nullified etc.  I think that this a healthy change and adds some interesting decision making on how you wish to spread your cynos around.
---
SP from injectors is used at a rate of (skill training multiplier) : 1.
---
So for a x8 skill, 8 injector SP gives you 1 character SP. (Or in terms of a whole injector, a 500,000 SP injector would give you 62,500 character SP)
---
Solid, thanks for the insight.
---
What about B.) Though? Wouldn't removing injectors just kick the can down the road?
---
So CCP needs to cater to your lifestyle.  Got it - that's what I figured you were really arguing all along, since you couldn't explain why you don't (a) defend yourself; (b) join a stronger group, or (c) move somewhere else.  
---
We got there eventually.  I'm proud of you.  Now HTFU snowflake.
---
&gt; cloaked ships cannot apply damage nor can apply ewar
---
Cloaked ships apply pyschological warfare
---
CCP: Don't adjust, let this play out for a few months, same with Blackout.
---
But don't take 3 years like with Rorq in case revision is required.
---
haha you're so bad at this
---
Not the bored ones that wouldn't mind a free easy escalation as added bonus, trust me
---
Over a 5-6 year period they lost one wormhole establishment... hmph
---
Yeah, think so. Edited to accuracy
---
So you want all the Krabs to quit, so you can become the Krabs?
---
&gt;I'll still log in every day to keep the skill queues going and keep up the research on BPOs waiting for the pendulum to swing back at least a little in the favor of my play style, but undock and actually play? Nope, I'm done.
---
If you keep paying your whining is meaningless
---
I mean even more than usual
---
Well, that's kind of what they've done here. Affecting cyno changes (including JF), aside from null, affects all of lowsec and even WH's (since they eventually need things moved in/out and plenty of WH's don't have the luxury of having easy access to highsec).
---
This. I remember sitting paranoid in a belt in my rookie ship in my starter system afraid someone was going to come along and can flip me or something.  It took me several days before I got the courage to take my tiny little ship from Malukker to Rens, and I was paranoid the entire trip.  That's the Eve I joined to experience.
---
Actually I guess it would need to be high quality bait since you can't just slap a cyno on something that would actually work as bait if you were a small gang.
---
That *was* the tl;dr I think.
---
Rail nagas
---
you're right, maybe it's five if you need to create an attribute "canFitCyno", set this value to 1 in the "forcereconship" group, in the "blackops" group, and add "requireattribute" to this attribute id in cyno modules.
---
Or use that extra high for a capital remote rep or a couple, and rep the recon.
---
Maybe the change is simply a money grab for additional accounts for caps and injectors.
---
&gt;I'm so incredibly happy that CCP is finally taking risks to shake up the game. This community has become far too complacent for far too long.
---
Same. And yes, it has. Big fat lazy whiny nullbears. They've been trending in that direction for a while. Entitled and expect everything handed to them.
---
&gt;Cloaked shit teleporting around a region is just as much cancer as supercaps teleporting around a region
---
Idk if you're memeing or retarded.
---
what are you trying to say here? you're post isn't making much sense
---
If HS use t1 dessys because CONCORD is gonna punish your ass; if LS use whatever besides a good scanning ship and a fast and good tackle.
---
I know.  It's great that my skill que finally likes up with a meta/mechanics change!
---
I dont support nullified cynos being removed personally. I agree that cyno inties are far too strong in their current state/cost, removing nullified cynos makes it very difficult to move around inside of enemy space cause of gate camps/bubbles.
---
Also important to note that even if t3cs can only light covert cynos, they can still bridge in a recon with a regular cyno.  This just removes the awkward middle step that, to me atleast, seems very contrived and unnecessary.
---
Also also, cloaky nullified t3s tend to be very lacking in tank.  And while yes you can refit your t3 at a safe to max tank, that both a) takes time, b) is expensive to brick tank, c) you are still required to have the cov ops subsystem which greatly limits your potential max tank.  If you wish to light a nullified cloaky cyno, it will be at the cost of a lot of ehp. 
---
 This trade off feels natural and healthy to me. It allows for something thats inline with CCPs vision of chaos, while also opening up a lot of options for skilled pilots/groups to use these mechanics to their advantage
---
Come back to top querious. it genuinely needs you.. or any pvpers... of any kind
---
SPOILER ALERT: Players that finally quit EVE don't come back (*re: 1st jump fatigue iteration*).
---
So basically, if I want to actually play the game, I would have to pay subscription price, otherwise I would just be grinding for plex, right?
---
My org chose a low class WH expressly for the safety aspect of it...we have a HS and a C4 static.
---
WTF does "congruent" mean in this post. You use it 6 times but the intended meaning is not obvious.
---
It w pi old be nice if we used team work. But we both know that's not going to happen. No matter what CCP does eve is a game were distrust runs deep.
---
Lot of discussion in this thread about how hard it is to bring a fleet into another red fleet that already holds the grid.  Lot of ideas and debates thrown around, which reminds me of... the Marines.
---
Everyone knows the area of expertise of the Army, Air Force, and Navy.  Few people know the function that Marines were created to perform.  Marines were designed to be trained to establish an amphibious beach head.  
---
The recent discussion can probably attest to the fact - getting a foothold is a lot trickier than one might imagine.
---
I don't know if I like the idea of the new cyno changes or not.  But I like the fact that getting a fleet onto the field just got a lot more tactically interesting.  Love it or hate it, big powers can all benefit from forming some "Marines" to help them figure out how to get a foothold in hostile areas.
---
\- I kind of want to sign this "Semper Fi", but as I've never been a marine myself, I have not earned that right.
---
What ship were you flying that took you 2 weeks to grind isk? A 2 billion ISK blinged out faction battleship?
---
Even that shouldn't be that long if you have a carrier or you live in a wormhole and have a rattlesnake. And if you're not making 120 mil an hour why the hell are you flying a faction battleship that costs 2 billion ISK?
---
Huh. Dirty.
---
Delicious cap pilot tears.
---
Erm, shouldn't the title say "start nerfing them" ?
---
Hell ya dude. I remember sitting in a belt in highsec mining with an osprey. Pretty sure they used to have a bonuses towards mining lasers. Anyways this dude shows up and ganks me. Goes “ I just wanted to check my fit” and gives me like 50m which was aloooot to me back then. And thats how I joined my first corp! Lol
---
What if no
---
Retarded.
---
Sure.
---
First, why do you carry signal amplifier and sensor booster? If to counter combat scanning then it is pointless - when you're cloaked you are unscannable anyway, and when you hack it's easier to scan site you're in, not your ship. 1 low slot and 1 medium slot wasted.
---
Second, train Archeology and Hacking to V and use T2 analyzers, they help A LOT. Also you could ignore data sites and fir only relic analyzer, this way you could use 1 extra medium slot for something else. Next level: use a mobile depot to refit analyzers. Next level: use a mobile depot to completely refit your ship for hunting when you want. Next level if you're rich: use Zeugma analyzer and Blackglass implant to get juicy 60 points virus attacks and switch hacking to easy mode.
---
Third, rigs. Better switch gravcap upgrade to T1 and use extra calibration and 3rd empty rig slot for something else. Empty slots are generally a bad sign.
---
Fourth, always pack extra charges. If you need only ECM drones then carry 15 of them, though I'd say take 5x ECM, 5x Caldari Navy Hornets and 5x Republic Fleet Warriors. Always have a spare set of probes, two sets to be sure. You never know when your internet could stop working and finding yourself lost in wormhole space just because you forgot to bring a bit of extra Core Scanner Probe I is a bad thing.
---
I dont fly rorgs. Why does everyone assume I am a miner? I haven't mined in 4 years. I am a pve/pvp pilot.
---
Before this change I don't think that would've mattered much since 5-10 seconds isn't enough to stop a Rorq from lighting its own cyno, but now that squishier ships are forced to light the cyno I think it's a good idea to consider.
---
The problem with cynos, as I see it, isn't that they lead to huge hotdrops but that they lead to huge hotdrops without counterplay opportunities. If a skilled subcap fleet gets the drop on a lone miner it currently doesn't matter what the fleet does, that Rorq will light a cyno to call in the cavalry and the fleet either runs, dies, or lights a cyno of their own. These proposed changes don't fix this problem, it makes it more expensive for the miner to have a get-out-of-jail-free card but it's still impossible for the attackers to actually stop them from calling for help.
---
My chaos-era proposal would be to add a spool-up time to cynos, nothing crazy but long enough for a coordinated group to react to it and stop it. In addition, I'd consider adding a period of time where ships taking a non-covert cyno would be unable to use their warpdrives. This is to help prevent cynos from simply being lit just off-grid and having the cavalry jump in to eliminate the counterplay aspect. It would make the positioning of cynos important, if you want to jump right into the thick of it you need to have enough control of that location to have a cyno survive being lit.
---
Ideally this change makes it harder for capital escalation as subcap fleets can focus down your cyno and force you to fight on their terms, but if you take a tankier cyno ship and some logi because you are *planning* to escalate it would be difficult to stop while at the same time being something that the attackers can have a chance to react to.
---
So basically we'd fly the way our clones actually see everything?
---
I mean idk about you but I’d rather loose
---
309mil compared to 20bil.
---
a ship for spod brains such as myself
---
I guess you didn't play those first 10 years when T1 frigates, destroyers and cruisers were absolutely useless. Take the rose colered glasses off, except for supers (which are a Dominion mistake) ships are the most balanced that they've ever been.
---
This is so true. Cynos probably were too powerful but ccp went over the deep end on this one
---
If the intention is to severely nerf how often cynos are used or can effectively be used, the current proposal is good. You suggest weakening the nerf to maintain more of the status quo. I dont see why they would want that.
---
T3cs can be used as cyno bait. This also needs to go.
---
It used to take 2 plex, then swapped to cash only for a short while before being phased out quietly, much to my dismay.  
---
I'm sure the profits on skill injectors are much higher.  
---
To get a new 100m SP char cost you 2 plex.  
---
Via injectors it would cost dozens of billions.
---
Skill injectors also messed with char pricing to due to SP dumping.
---
Doesn't that make character trading worse than injectors? Whenever  an injector is used the net SP in the game goes down.
---
The amount of SP needed to make enough injectors to make a titan pilot is far greater than the amount of SP a titan pilot has.
---
You always had to
---
Mauarders lighting a cyno feels exactly like blops lighting a cyno; theres no reason why it should be on the hull besides CCP giving them a pity "buff" 
---
which by the way isnt a buff, its just them not receiving a nerf :)
---
I only had 2 hrs or so a day to play. With family, and a busy job. Hard to justify Eve.
---
These cyno changes are, without a doubt, going to hurt the little guys more than it hurts the big guys.  In 6 months we will STILL be talking about super cap umbrellas and force projection because this will not have the intended effect.
---
It has become (even more) painfully obvious that CCP, as a business, is run by people who constantly react to things rather than sit down and proactively plan and strategize.  (And they probably thinking having a meeting about the game's problems is being proactive.)  If you're reacting all the time you're never going to get ahead of your problems and you're never, aside from sheer luck, going to find the right solution.
---
This will not stop capital proliferation. If anything it will push people straight to supers with a recon alt for cyno on grid.
---
What did change was an artificial push to sell injectors and plex/subs.
---
I remember similar shit being said when the blackout came out. I specifically remember a few other dudes and myself saying something along the lines of "*this won't do shit but kill subcap PVE and hurt newer players, have adverse affects on smaller groups, and hunting fields will dry up thus yielding less kills overall.*" - Guess what happened? All that. You know why we knew this? Because we have common fucking sense and an ability to forecast results from these implementations. 
---
The \~elite pvpers\~ **WERE SO FUCKING PISSING THEIR PANTS EXCITED ABOUT BLACKOUT** then quickly realized they were getting shit on harder than normal b/c... you're fucking bad.
---
Fairly certain this is unique to Delve.
---
You put 1000 strontium into a tower and it was rfed for 10hrs.
---
You put 1500 strontium you got 15 hrs.
---
Unless you changed the fuel level as it was being attacked you were stuck with whatever amount of time you had put in previously.
---
Band of Brothers was known for hanging timers 4 times a day so they always had ideal timers.
---
Not enough of a cost is the problem.  Multiboxing is commonplace and there is already a preponderance of cyno alts.  Right now, the majority of the cost of packing a cyno is plexing/subbing a spare account, and cheaper workarounds exist if you compromise response time a little.  That clearly hasn't discouraged capital proliferation, so it's safe to say that the cost of a sub doesn't fix anything by itself.
---
Under a system where cynos come with massive fitting requirements and penalties, even to the point they only fit on battleships and ruin their combat capabilities, you're looking at 4-ish extra days of training for a new character to get up to speed.  Yea, battleships cost significantly more than frigates or corvettes, but that's the same kind of cost/time adjustment caused by the proposed changes, just much less of one.
---
Letting people fit cynos on cheap ships means the only cost of bringing a cyno is the question "did I pay my extra $15?" which hasn't discouraged capital proliferation yet.  It's pretty clear they're trying to introduce an opportunity cost to fitting cynos that doesn't currently exist, which simple stat penalties and fitting requirements won't themselves introduce.  You won't risk a 400m hull to save a 100m fleet, but you might be willing to throw away something cheaper.
---
nullified cloaky t3s have very minimal tank.  cloaky subsystem is the weakest defensive subsystem, and the nullified subsystem only gives 1 low slow, while the others give +2 mid/low slots, meaning this hurts both armor and shield fits.
---
Not to mention that if youre nullified you will likely fit istabs/warp accelerators as well, further hurting your ehp.
---
Incompetence.
---
yes but after the cloaked cyno ran, if it still alive and it still doesn't solve how you move carriers. Spending 500mil on your cynot is okay for a super but for a carrier I would agree not so much, so the carriers will not move.
---
reee cyno changes reee
---
do you have some sort of data to support this "playerbase" claim?
---
&gt; They were known as "learning skills".
---
Yes, I know. That was a reason why I did not start to play EVE like 5-7 years earlier. I started to learn "learnings" and in few days decided that I do not want to play this :D
---
&gt;You have no idea how good you have it.
---
Well, I have. Yes, EVE is much better for newbies now.
---
&gt;And still all new players do is whine, whine, whine.
---
You mean vet. players? Because I do not, I am pretty happy with both Injectors and Blackout and Cyno-changes.
---
&gt;now I'm sitting on close to 100million SP on my main (zero injecting) and a net worth over 100 billion.
---
Well, we are on same spot now then. For some time I paid sub with real money, did not pay for ISK. Took me a bit less it seems, thank to injectors I do not have to wait years to get there.
---
&gt;EVE is a goal oriented game. Set a goal and work for it, over time.
---
Why you do not consider getting Injectors as *work*? I did trade to afford it, other guy did farm to afford it, some1 may work in real life for it. It's not like we get something for free.
---
And yes, there was a goal for me, I wanted to fly solo/small-scale and fight with fleets. Worked for it, there now. Have other goals.
---
This is not pay to win. It’s pay to skip. Quite different.
---
Meanwhile, that time AFK in highsec earned perhaps 20M in bulky goods while spending an hour in null will earn much more than that, deposited directly in ISK.
---
risk/reward you know.
---
err yes, comms was full of people talking about what titan they're saving for and all that nonsense.
---
not to mention look at who is/was running the incursion groups in null - it's all the old high sec incursion FCs.
---
The point is to make a large sum in a short time by having outrageous short term changes that are going to bring a lot of people back in, even if it's detrimental to game health in the long term.
---
What graphics?
---
Maybe. It might drop off when the whale population dwindles. I'd like to give it six months to see how things shake out.
---
me too, that's why i have a gym membership.

That's year of subscription which 90% of customers will never go through. Ignorance is a bliss.
---
Sounds like a bot... And if not then an R.U.R. bot.
---
When I went from 4 accounts to 3 I felt severely handicapped. Just saying.
---
The fact that CCP wants to make eve hard is driving away their playerbase. Simple.
---
"carebear provi" is 11th active region in eve history...
---
You can play as alpha for free! Definitely give alpha a go, and like others said, you'll know if you wanna sub after that
---
What about also adding in the idea of fleets getting scattered over a small area...so that way they aren't in a perfect fleet formation right off the batt?
---
Yeah you could give an all 5's toon to a n00b and most people who've been playing for any length of time could wreck them in a fight.  Paying doesn't give you skills, just sp.
---
&gt; instead of using someone's random ceptor or dictor alt that does nothing else
---
...you do realize account sharing is against the EULA, right? And you just more or less stated it's normal for you to just use someone else's account? :P
---
&gt; You and CCP have told me "fuck off, you're playing the game wrong". So I am.
---
Welcome to every update in the past 3-4 years that shit on small gangers.
---
This change will still have massive ramifications on "the status quo", regardless of t3cs can light cynos or not.
---
And you can check my comment history for what i said about the tankyness of these t3cs, but the fact that a cyno could be bait isnt really valid tbh.  How is baiting someone a bad thing in this new world of 'chaos'?  Its your own fault for falling for it.  And you can still brick/dual tank a force recon to be a bait cyno, it makes no difference.
---
And you can also look at the model of the t3 to see if it has the cov ops system fit, instantly giving away if its bait or not.  Or, you know, just use your brain to determine if its bait :)
---
For me, taking nullified cynos out of the game is one of the most exciting parts. While yes, you can light the covert and bridge the recon, but all of that takes more TIME which is key. Recons will also be much easier to kill with a target paint and some alpha.
---
As for the refitting the T3C that doesn't take much time at all if you know what you're doing and if they are able to light a reg cyno, get one fax in and it's invincible, the resists are so high.
---
The non nullified cynos are the biggest hit to the supercap umbrella IMO, if you're hunting, bring dictors and put bubbles up in line with gates and at strategic locations and you actually stand a chance at killing whatever it is you caught.
---
Nah, it was straight up X stront per hour, with the timer being whatever whole number of hours could be supplied by the stront.
---
Max was 1d17h for a normal tower, or 2d7h if you held sov in the system (sov confers a 25% fuel reduction).
---
The tower also couldn't be refueled/adjusted below 50% shield hp, but wouldn't reinforce until 25%.
---
You're right.  Was using the wrong word.  I'll edit it.  Was supposed to be contiguous.
---
this game died 1.5years ago.
---
98.9% don't make it past 90 days. 
---
My point still stands. Fuck capitals.
---
way to fat shame me :'(
---
That is not the only I win button.
---
Nah, the blue breadstick
---
&gt; But if you want to ~~melt~~ **gank** ~~someone~~ **an unsuspecting and likely unarmored pilot** as fast as possible CODE fits are the best.
---
FTFY.
---
Stfu, it's pay to win. Anyone arguing that it is not pay to win is a deluded, self indulgent jackass who should go take a bath with a toaster.
---
The old alt farms were effectively free as well.  A GTC ran you about 300mil for a month of time.  When they were selling the farmed combat alts for 10 billion or so, they were still making pretty good returns after the initial investment.  If I'm right it had a better profit margin then current injector farms.
---
The biggest difference is time to return.  Sill injectors give you a much faster return on your investment and they're proof against changes in the meta.  This has many more people doing it which has exasperated the proliferation issue.
---
That sounds about right. I don't remember the mechanics that well anymore.
---
Exactly, if you really wanted to screw with industrial goo farms have extracted skills burn out. Then a 5m toon trained to Jump Freighter (14x) can't just train JF V over and over
---
&gt;Now cynos? Every major fight.. BR- you name it.. started and happened because of cynos. 
---
And many fights didnt happen because of cynos and instant n+1, but you dont see those.
---
alpha is cool if you like being teased
---
Why would people fight it. Many people find the game good enough to plex through in game means but not good enough to pay cash for. Many will choose to play different games.
---
&gt;Why you do not consider getting Injectors as work? I did trade to afford it, other guy did farm to afford it, some1 may work in real life for it. It's not like we get something for free.
---
Because you didn't put any work into *the game*. All you did was buy what you have. It didn't take any skill, experience, or effort in the game. You didn't have to learn anything, do any grinding, or engage in creativity. You just had to get out your credit card. You paid for a shortcut. Your RMT'd your way to where you are.
---
And as such, you will never have the same feelings and experience players like me have when we log in and see our characters and assets load. In a way I feel very sorry for you. You have the SP and the ISK... but you'll never have the intangibles that veteran players get to experience. It's a very rewarding feeling. That you'll never have.
---
Go back to World of Warcraft.
---
capitals vs capitals arent the problem sweetie, its capitals vs people who dont/cant use capitals due to problems such as the other side having a much bigger escalation, WHers, small gang/low character count corps etc.
---
He mad
---
This is false, moongoo is mined all across the cluster, In every region of the game they are r64 who are owned and mined, aswell as r32 and r16. You're just good at mining spod with miner II for 50m per hours, while people In low and null npc prods alot of tech 2 comp with theirs moons and reaction
---
Unpopular opinion, the problem isnt skill injectors but being able to create as many accounts as you want. That was a mistake born from greed on ccps part. Skill injectors just turbocharged that aspect. A player inject into a Rorqual or titan in itself isnt problematic, its just stupid. A player injecting multiple characters is very problematic. If you have farm alts, you know rather well that you behavior isnt healthy for the overall game. You are just having isk faucets running because CCP lets you.
---
Sure, Eve is designed to entice you to create as many accounts as possible so changing that to one account would break the game, but bashing on injectors is just ignoring new players all together. And yes different to popular opinion there are new people joining the game. And have you tried doing anything useful with an account younger then a year without injectors? Would it work without knowing what play style you aim for with that character and fitting implants and filling evemon the first day? 
---
Eve had quite a bit longer then a decade of power creep. The problem is that the best way to get into eve is to create an account, buy a year worth of subscription fill evemon and start playing a year from now. If thats your first accounts, thats extremely shitty for you, if its your 5th, its awesome because you dont actually have the downside of waiting, you just make ISK by doing nothing. You are not actually sacrificing anything by having another character if having +1 is isk positive.
---
Banning injectors wont fix that imbalance of basically getting an isk faucet for older players who can passively convert how early they got into the game into isk by creating farm alts. 
---
Make farm alts no longer isk viable by combating parallelization and voila, your problem is solved. No demand for additional characters means no market for SP farming outside of people catching up. But that would mean that CCP also no longer gets multiple omega subscriptions from one person. 
---
Oh and you would also kill the play style of 99% of the people here, cause we had multiboxing so long that some mechanics dont work without an alt.
---
Instead, how about instead you just crack down on passive income? Make isk faucets either require more interaction to prevent parallelized farming or make it more dangerous so you actually create content instead of just ruining this game. Picture imagine injecting into multiboxed rorqual mining in a wormhole  without a station to dock level of dangerous.
---
Oh wait... thats what CCP is actually doing with the changes you listed :)
---
Just not enough because the carebares of null cry about their safe passive isk faucets in an area that is supposed to be more dangerous then high and lowsec. Add to the nerf list of out of game intel, super cap umbrellas, citadels and cynos and most of the problem we have right now would be fixed.
---
But you do like your passive isk faucet dont you? Bit ironic since the people screaming loudest about skill injectors are the ones who are ruining this game by exploiting mechanics to create unintended safe isk faucets.
---
Honestly all I can agree with here is yes they maybe shouldn't have nuked NS without making sure there is some better retention else where.
---
They honestly need more people than they have. They need a team for each sec level NVM special cases. Such as citidels n ships.
---
NS was broken and it would have killed the game much faster if it remained unchanged. This I know for sure. Vni afk ratting, super bloc ratting, umbrellas afk rorquals.. like the list goes on and it all comes from NS so yes it needed to change.. yes ccp is probably spitballing to see what sticks, cuz I really doubt any of us KNOW what to do
---
Citidels we're going to be a problem since release due to the fact they refuse to limit them for some reason. Simple as that they are to cheap and to easy to make for blocs to not do things like gate perches with them. They should have been limited somehow.
---
I have little to no direct experience with fozzie sov or any for that matter the whole thing bores me to tears.. all tidi fuck fests do..
---
Only Avatars should get the pink skin
---
This is a good response, I don't understand the down votes.
---
You must be unfamiliar in how cynos work, or alphas.
---
The umbrella arguement is moot. Every single system under the umbrella will have a cyno beacon, if it doesnt already have one.  
---
If they want to bridge in a cloaky nullified t3c to a bridge and warp it on grid without refitting, theres a decent chance that it will die before their cyno gets lit.
---
I can also see an arguement for like a 5-10 second spool up time on cynos. Would be interesting
---
jesus do you even play the game ? I guess not
---
They already implemented this. At the end of a triglavian room you can take the pvp gate and do a 1 on 1.
---
Yea, at the end of the day, I don't really have nothing to lose.
---
Pay to win,skip, hit harder, fly faster, etc.. the win part doesnt really matter. The point of the “pay 2 win” saying is that the gaming company (ccp in this case) is forcing its players to shed out irl money to get a leg up in the game. Thus essentially Pay 2 [insert your desired phrase] ... the focus is on the pay part.. :)
---
Chars were not fungible. There are SP farms, so the SP is very likely increasing much faster than before.
---
I honestly miss towers. Not the set up or take down but most of the rest was great.
---
This is not an argument. It’s an insult. I still disagree and define eve as pay to skip.
---
and yet you're still here
---
Just remove capital ships entirely.
---
&gt;capitals vs capitals arent the problem sweetie,
---
Then why is that use case getting nerfed harder then the other use cases.
---
Sweetie
---
Uni still has the POS info.

Even with a beacon, they will have to warp to the tackles person, with bubbles up, they can't get close, target still dies, it's not a moot point because beacons don't solve everything.
---
Is this a single day of activity?
---
You need a much larger set of Data, a single fleet could reduce pve or increase pvp
---
Wow dude I find you in every single thread being salty about the new patch. I've never seen salt levels as high as yours ever before.
---
I doubt they are officer fit.
---
You are an insult. Keep swiping that credit card.
---
Any exploration fit that has a cargo scanner should be ignored. Literally no reason to use one except maybe Covert data sites. Waste of a slot and makes you a bigger douche than a member of CODE.
---
Been back 3 times since then lol
---
People used to train characters up to sell before as well. As for the SP increasing faster, that's pure speculation.
---
To be fair, at least it feels like CCP is hitting everyone with the HTFU hammer.  
---
Highsec players got WarDec mechanics that are offensive. 
---
Station traders faced a big tax hike.
---
Nullsec ratters lost relative safety.
---
Cap blobbers have a lot harder time calling in the calvery
---
It might be the case that CCP has finally listened to the Lowsec guys, but instead of giving Lowsec some tweaks, they will tweak everything else until the rest of the game is as salty as lowsec bros.
---
Krabbing in nullsec is safe.  Evictions don’t add much risk—its the cost of doing business.  And business in nullsec is much better than highsec.
---
Since I've actually dealt with a continuous stream of "small gangers" coming into our space for years, I'm gonna  have to call bullshit on this r/Eve narrative that small gang was impossible.  'Cause I've seen the wrecks and killmails of their success.  Heck, suitonia swung by solo and tried to kill my barges a couple times....and he didn't die.
---
What was impossible was an easy gank-and-escape that allowed people to pretend they are elite.
---
I'm not particularly interested in being the target of such ganks.
---
So have fun.  Pretend you're a bad-ass.  I'll be over here, doing something else.
---
&gt;If new players getting into Caps is a problem that means Caps are too powerful. CCP created them to be overpowered because they were so hard to get into. Now they're not hard to get into, that means they shouldn't be so powerful. 
---
But they are end game content. The might be imbalanced even without cynos, but everything is instantly injectable, so injectors themselves are imbalanced.
---
&gt;Injectors aren't the problem, it's how easy it is to multibox high resource (be it isk or ore) yielding ships. 
---
It is "easy" partially because of injectors. At some point one only needs look at the major change to realize what the problem is. Injectors were that major change.
---
Between brick tanking and capital reps, by the time you get through it it will be too late. Shit, you may fuck off before you get through it.
---
Null PvErs are literally a cancer rotting the game from the inside out, driving down the price of material and devaluing ISK. Literally turning New Eden into a third world shithole.
---
Bad day?
---
I saw someone mention banking unallocated sp on an alpha alt. Are they just talking about saving bonus sp from events or is there a way to make your training accumulate unallocated sp instead of putting it directly into skills?
---
This is actually an anti-botting feature. You can kill them if paying attention and not in a hulk. Their salvage is worth the occasional inconvenience if you are active.
---
Players too dumb for that. Tragedy of the commons, etc.
---
When all you can "afford" to fly is bullshit small ships due to limited in-game funs, the game gets pretty dull very quickly.
---
Why would who?
---
Generally the reason would be to not overnerf.
---
Honestly the best fleet was with that mad man flying the T2 frig fleets, I have never felt so valued while flying T2 frig logi as I did when went out with him. 
---
I think his name is mayday? Total legend, dodging titan Lance's and going full balls of steel into pretty much anything and coming out the other side dead, laughing or both.
---
Man, kinda of amped to move everything down on Saturday, excited 😁
---
The answer to that is it depends.   How often they play how much and how much they make.   Ie someone who casually plays that could be a stretch.  Or it could be 15 dollars someone does not want to pay or cant afford to pay.
---
Ive been out of the game for a while and i'm wondering if i should avoid mission running in high sec system that has been invaded?
---
&gt; Because you didn't put any work into the game. All you did was buy what you have.
---
Well, you seem to not read what I've wrote. I did put work in game, I get ISK from station trading. But I still do not mind if anyone else pays real-money. It's just nice kills, if they have no piloting skills. Also they pay for game development, which is nice for me too.
---
&gt;It didn't take any skill, experience, or effort in the game.
---
So, I guess, anyone can get billions of isk station-trading if it's that easy and does not require any skill or effort? And for guy who farm for Injectors it did not require skill and effort too?
---
And again, even if some1 paid RM for ISK and SP - it's still just fun and kills for you, vet.pilot, because he has no skills nor experience. What seems to be a problem here?
---
&gt;You didn't have to learn anything, do any grinding, or engage in creativity.
---
And again, both me and guy who farm - did. And for guy who paid RM, well, he paid for Devs creativity and for game you also playing. What is wrong with it? He's not getting any real advantage from it.
---
&gt;You just had to get out your credit card. You paid for a shortcut. Your RMT'd your way to where you are.
---
What kind of shortcut? Being able to use same ships as you? Well, I put a lot of effort to have it, why you want to show it like finger-snap-easy thing?
---
&gt;And as such, you will never have the same feelings and experience players like me have when we log in and see our characters and assets load.
---
So, you think that my efforts just worse then yours... Well, okay.
---
&gt;It's a very rewarding feeling. That you'll never have.
---
Dramatic ending. Well, I still enjoy my playtime and ships and skills and fights I get. Sorry to disappoint you.
---
Yeah, but you didnt have this many caps before. Dessie 5 could not be turned into titan 5.
---
&gt;As for the SP increasing faster, that's pure speculation.
---
Only CCP knows, but do you doubt it?
---
Hah you are right.. that makes his post even more retarded.
---
Goddamnit, two days in a row I'm upvoting you. Stahp!!!
---
&gt;4-5b Gila sounds like a lot of overkill, but I am not up to devote 10-20h to prove this. (or not prove)
---
You can look this up if you want to. You need at a very minimum a 2B fit, with more money meaning you get more rooms for errors. Losing that Gila is hard.
---
&gt;Well, I guess Maelstorm does not require all that skills and dedicated leveling that you mentioned for Gila, ye?
---
It's roughly the same in training, but by the point that you get that training, you also get enough ISK to buy the Maelstorm. They're timed nearly perfectly. You'll need to grind a lot if you want that expensive Gila.
---
&gt;Good to tackle what? I have no idea what could 1 day trained frigate tackle... Sleeping Venture?
---
Funnily enough, that's probably the 1 thing you can't tackle (or anyone else for that matter, in FW anyway). Have you ever been in FW? If a 1 day newbro joins a FW alt, they can have an impact on the fight, fighting small shit day 1.
---
&gt;Yepp, and this Rorqs will have to keep Recon as cyno, and this cyno  could be killed now. So your 6 Rorqs is getting kind of vulnerable a  bit.
---
That's new as of today. And honestly, I still don't think it's going to be much of an issue until CCP nerf's PANIC. That 5 min of invulnv is more than enough to save those Rorqs. Especially since you've got a whole lot of EHP to burn through to kill 6 Rorqs. Alts are essentially free too, so it's not much work to have one ready in a citadel, to warp in to light a cyno. I could even cyno in 100-200kms out where you can't easy kill the recon, but can still be attacked by supers. Very likely too, that null groups will just have a Titan or Blops out and send in a couple of recons to guarantee that cynos remain on field (or really, at this point, a subcap defense fleet, which would be great news for the attacker, but I don't think that's going to happen too often.). 
---
&gt;Well, we both know that one blingy ship is still get killed by 2-3 t2 ships.
---
ISK can be used for a lot more than buying a ship for my main. What if I get 2-3 blingy ships on my alts? What if I get a super? I can also use this ISK for a lot more than just buying and exploding ships.
---
&gt;Yep, but they get a little more vulnerable when the got no cyno in fit.  It's not dramatic change, but it shifts balance a bit in direction I  like.
---
It's also going in the direction that I like, but until you reduce the infinite anoms, or find another way to spread ratters/miners across space, all you're doing is clustering anybody with a cap+ closer together. What ship can use a cyno doesn't really matter if you're only a few jumps out from staging, where someone could just jump a few recons and guarantee that the cynos stays lit.
---
I didn't realise that high sec ganking gives people kill rights lol. What's the best way to handle this?
---
My lifestyle has nothing to do with it. But good to see you are still trying to make it personal. The cyno changes are interesting though I’m curious how the super umbrellas will adjust.
---
Except it would be fairly equally wasted as it could be loosened to something you already had or would have prefered, just for your recon/blops skills to go unused.
---
But yes, overtightening and then loosening it GENERALLY better than failing to tighten enough in the first place.
---
I am not particularly against the change, just feel that it may be overly restrictive for many uses, especially in how it doesn't impact cloaky dropping, which is a curious way to handle it.
---
It may result in far less capital usage though.
---
Makes sense.
---
I miss POS sov and the initial jammer fights. Maybe it was because I was still kinda new to the game, but those fights felt like there were real consequences.
---
When you enter a system, and there is a titan(s), and / or supercarrier(s) sitting on the gate, it is "a bad place to be".
---
Expect a hictor or dictor companion.  Mobile bubbles anchored on gates are fairly rare (as they are unavoidable), but anchored drag and stop bubbles are fairly common, however though those are not commonly camped by titans and supers.
---
Smartbombs on large-model capitals have a huge radius, and can be activated in close enough proximity to cover most gates.
---
Fighters &amp; fighter bombers can seriously ruin your day.  Even Upwell fighters from on-grid structures can be at the gate.
---
Boson is a 30 degree cone AoE with 5 minute cycle, 20 second duration, with 1 second damage ticks.   Damage done per tick:  10,000 EM + 10,000 KIN + 10,000 THERM + 10,000 EXP.
---
Then how does the change accomplish anything?
---
Like i can remember 4 big onces, 
---
Stranger Danger
---
Hard knocks 
---
Pos party 
---
Adhocracy 
---
There have been smaller evictions and bigger once's i can't remember right now.
---
Injectors was the worst thing ever added to Eve Online. The time based Skilling system is what made Eve unique. Now it's just another shit tier money grab game.
---
For killing a gila (one of the most popular mission runners) destroyers would not be optimal as gila has high dps and applies this dps to dessies really well while you have to chew through it's substantial shield buffer. Use cruisers. Interceptor that can tank some damage for tackle and cruisers for dps would be reasonable. Then ofc there is the question of scanning down the target. The t3d's can fit expanded launcher without gimping fit.
---
I'm not actually in CODE if that makes you feel any better about the agreement.
---
highly doubt they're going to bring back skill lose. the feedback from people randomly losing skills when you'd forget to update your clone was almost entirely negative for years until they outright got rid of it.
---
command burst or bubble generator :D
---
they only reason youre gonna see more stukas is that they'll actually have a better chance to kill their targets now. they dont benefit from this travel wise as they utilize non-covert ships
---
Next time, if you want to save a bit of time, you can just link your gank lossmail and I'll understand.  Would you like to buy a mining permit?
---
maybe adapt or go play tetris
---
They do show up a lot and pack a punch. My Orca was down to 90% shield and that's with shield boosts running. I can only imagine what they'll do to noobie ventures who don't have them on the overview. They can be seen in dscan. 
---
They showed up 3 times in one hour for me.
---
Boosh recon 3 times free carrier.
---
To be honest, I find it very difficult to believe that Goons or any other large alliance cares about the well-being of  "the little guy".  If anything, these alliances have done little more than crap on "the little guy" with every means at their disposal in game or otherwise. 
---
I have no doubt that the big alliances will be fine, but I don't think anyone is buying the "concern for the little guy" false narrative at all.
---
&gt;seems like a huge risk to put something on the field
---
Working as intended
---
People under say 100,000,000Sp still would so they would actually do what they should. Help improve balance for new players
---
They said they wanted chaos. I call bullshit unless they implement these changes immediately. Time to nut up or shut up ccp!
---
&gt;Dramatic ending. Well, I still enjoy my playtime and ships and skills and fights I get. Sorry to disappoint you.
---
I never said anything about not enjoying the game. I'm talking about something else, that you clearly have no inkling of based on this response.
---
Take care bro. I give it another year before you're bored of EVE on easy mode and aren't active anymore. Fly safe. o7
---
Worth noting before you thoughtfully respond with some variant of HTFU/carebear/krab/gitgud that after this guy got drive by'd he immediately scanned down/bubbled one of the titans and dropped the response that killed it. As far as I know it was the first titan to go down during blackout. So he's not the type to stream tears/salt all over comms and forums. He bounces right back and kills shit.
---
Correlation is not causation.
---
I'm not trying to shit on your statement, but I legit cannot recall many times/posts/BR of bomber fleets getting bombed.
---
lol, do I look like I fucking lick rocks for a living or shuffle shit around, you blathering, gutless gank-tard?
---
I just think you guys and your "RP" are fucking cancer.
---
Even without injectors or character trading the number of capital pilots in the game would increase, that's just because of the age of the game.
---
Okay, see ya o/
---
I thought the official goon line was "we're going to be fine."
---
Injectors don't cause problems. They exacerbate problems.
---
I'm not strictly against changing them, but I personally can't figure out how to change them without it hurting ccp's bottom line at least in the short term,
---
If CCP takes away your ability to make money in the game, then CCP will gladly sell you PLEX, which you can sell for money in the game.
---
I like matterall, but he can be kind of a cheesedick sometimes.
---
When you talk like that, yes, you do "look" like you lick rocks for a living.  Calm down miner.
---
I thought about this, but I don't like things to be non-deterministic in that way. It'd be quite frustrating to drop on grid, get a bad position relative to your logi just because of bad luck on the jump, then get webbed up and be unable to get closer. I don't think forcing ships to fan out as part of the jump is necessarily the best way to handle it, but I would like to see positioning in general be more important and less blobby.
---
You know I was against the change until this post.
---
Lets fucking do it bitches.
---
They really have no failsafe.  At the tempo that CCP is changing things they are making an “all in” bet with the game, without doing the hard ground work of improving the NPE and retention/engagement of new players.  
---
No real plan to replace anyone with real new players.  CCP has shown how crap they are at that.  They hope that they will get back old players, but how long people that have already left the game will stick around is a matter for discussion.  
---
The only real response to player loss (according to Reddit and maybe CCP) would be to claim that people who quit after years in the game really just needed to harden up, and if they could not ‘adapt’ New Eden really did not want to have them playing the game anyway.   They would just clutter up space with their ships anyway.
---
Do you have any sort of data to support your claim as well? You have been doing nothing but bitching about this change all day long. I would love to see you prove instead of just saying that it will be a bad change.
---
That's actually kinda brilliant.  Good for them.  (Still hope you got them though)
---
Whine tank, best tank?
---
&gt;This change will still have massive ramifications on "the status quo", regardless of t3cs can light cynos or not.
---
But you are trying to weaken the nerf. It's bad enough that some caps will have alts in cloaked recons with cyno ready. It can be suspected CCP chose recons because they generally aren't that tanky.
---
&gt;but the fact that a cyno could be bait isnt really valid tbh. How is baiting someone a bad thing in this new world of 'chaos'?
---
It is what causes caps to be dropped on subcaps. CCP is talking about few options for cyno disruption and how cap response time is oppressive to activity.
---
&gt;Its your own fault for falling for it. 
---
That's impossible since you don't know, but as CCP said, it is oppressive. Not taking a fight because of possible cyno demonstrates that oppressiveness.
---
&gt;And you can still brick/dual tank a force recon to be a bait cyno, it makes no difference.
---
But you said t3cs can be tankier than a recon, so not sure what you mean.
---
The last change didn't, This change didn't. We don't know if the next change will. 
---
However, we also do not know if this is all ground work in preparation for a major change in conflict drivers. 
---
The changes so far are unprecedentedly huge. That alone gives me a *little* confidence that the sum of these changes is going to cause change much bigger than what we can see so far.
---
CCP reply :

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvM7av1o1Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgvM7av1o1Q)
---
Me too pal, me too.
---
What? You literally believe your own lies. Nothing of the sort happened. All the smaller corps are having a blast. You are just making things up now.  
---
You have zero fucking ability other than producing excellent quality salt. Move on fag. Nobody cares about you or your made up facts and so called forecasts.
---
It seemed quite stable for some time because players quitting. We certainly never came close to the levels we have now.
---
&gt;Imagine playing a game that you enjoy ( we do enjoy this game right?)   
---
The fuck do you mean, we're all here because of sunken cost fallacy.
---
cynos haven't been a I win button except for very large organizations since the last couple of capital nerfs.
---
You might be surprised at how few of those new people actually stay. Those fights play a lot worse than they read in an article. Ever watch a stream from a big fight? It's boring.. completely mind numbing.
---
CCP.
---
It seems reasonable to assume if they thought they "overnerfed", the nerf would not look the way it does.
---
It's called a Prospect.
---
I want all the Krabs to quit, so we can play how Eve is meant to be played. Not just Krabbing or not just PvPing. All of them.
---
6D chess man...you should work for CCP. :-)
---
Oh as opposed to actually making the aforementioned cyno disruption? Cool.
---
Yeah. Because what are four dudes in subcaps gonna do to a HAW dread or a blob of 20 guys with ram jags and Leshaks? People want fights. They don’t want to feed.
---
That is way more true than I'd like to admit.
---
It doesn't.   It makes you vulnerable.   Increasing content.
---
Here since 2003, will be here until the lights are turned off (or my light is turned off whichever comes first). I still think the golden age of EVE was 2004-2007. Can't ever have that back, but I still take great enjoyment from the game and I say this as a mostly solo/small gang player. 
---
From my long experience nullsec didn't always used to be as safe as it became, those initial golden years as I mentioned, it felt more like a wild west before POSes, Capitals and then deployable stations became a thing and players could hold the space they tried to own. My corp owned one of the very first Motherships in the game (you can call them Supercarriers all you like, they're Motherships still to me!) and we gained some infamy by being the ones that pretty much pioneered the hotdrop, but we always knew eventually that little niche we occupied would be gone once everyone and their mums started owning capitals. I always thought when capitals were introduced there should've been some proliferation limitations, because the end result would always be that everyone would eventually have them. They should be rare things to see, but that boat sailed a long long time ago.
---
But as I said, I still love this game, and will be here to see every change - good or bad - until it really does die or I do :P
---
&gt; It's pretty clear they're trying to introduce an opportunity cost to fitting cynos that doesn't currently exist, which simple stat penalties and fitting requirements won't themselves introduce. You won't risk a 400m hull to save a 100m fleet.
---
Uh huh, I'm a miner, and you're Lord Zap.
---
Cannot take seriously anyone posting about nullsec being “safer than highsec”....
---
large nullsec bloc vs large nullsec bloc isnt being nerfed harder, this is merely your perception of it because that that is where you probably spend all your time, and because this nerf hits very close to home.
---
And both null blocs will still have many brick tanked falcons for all of their fleets just you wait :)
---
It really depends what kind of corp you will be joining. I tend to have a few places for me stuff. PVP ships near my fav pvp spots, and everything else near jita or amarr, and then of course my favorite mission ship in my favorite mission systems.
---
I recently underwent manual consolidation of my assets and it sucked....but I found most of it I didnt need and sold. 
---
Ultimately, you need to decide what kind of corp you are going to join before you can best decide what kind of asset spread you are going to give/need for yourself.
---
and as much as we complained about them, POSes died faster and in only one RF.
---
You mean to say that EVE players lack the social skills to understand sarcasm?        
---
Say it ain't so!
---
Good idea, make the game even worse for newbies.
---
I love how whenever CCP pushes a balance change that involves something that takes more SP, people immediately put on tinfoil hats and claim the only reason for the change is to drive sales of injectors.
---
If you can't see the effects of all the nerfs and other balance changes you listed, then I have no confidence you have any understanding of why they did this.
---
That's going further back than what I remember playing (600mil PLEX when I started). They're not as free as they are today. There's both time to return, but also investment required.
---
A newbro with a lot of patience can start a small farm right now. All they need is 3 months + 2bil/char or 15$/char. You could also spend 12bil/char to get it right now, but that's out of reach of a lot of people (to set up a bigger farm anyways). Someone could even start a 20+ char farm and then pay the 2b/char when they get the isk.
---
Even at 300mil/GTC, you couldn't really create a useful alt in the 1 month (paying 15$), but maybe an okay one at 6-7 months (paying 2 bil investment). Later on, as the price of PLEX increased (let's say to 600 mil), you only have 3 months of training for the same isk investment. You needed a few bils of investment to start your farm, making it much more restrictive to who can start it.
---
Profileration is also worsened even more because it became a very easy way to get many alts for free. You can now get 10 mining alts if you want, all you need is that 3 months + 2bil/char + injectors to get mining skills (probably 4-5bil). Don't even need to pay a cent. I know people with 10+ alts used for farming, then another group of specialized combats chars (wormholes). They exacerbate a lot of problems in eve.
---
At least you already have the frig skill to 5 for inties.
---
Sorry, my stuff only goes to people who understand sarcasm.
---
But now we have people running injector farms, producing way more SP than ever possible before. There are people running 50+ acounts farming SP.
---
You do lob law bombs while writing in your law blog?

If your entire fleet is already so set up as to be in system, with many dictors bubbling both their beacon, bridge, every gate, and the grid itself, you have already won.  This is the best case scenario for the attackers.
---
The much, much more realistic case is that you bubble the rorquals  while your main fleet is burning to system.  
---
Also also, the defenders can simply bridge in their subcap fleet to the beacon w/ the force recons, then warp to a ping on the grid.
---
Too smart for ccp. They hit things with a hammer and see what happens
---
There are characters in this game with 15 years of natural skill production behind them. In a game where skill points can determine fight outcomes, that creates a rather severe advantage for seasoned players. Injectors can give new players a means to close the gap if they are willing to put in the grind to get the isk (or just buy plex if they're so inclined). I don't think I want to see injectors go away. They provide attainable goals that allow people to feel more involved or independent.
---
Instead, add a fatigue mechanic to injectors to slow down rapid alt creation. It should take 2-3 months to inject sufficient skills to fly a capital or a properly-fitted recon. Use a similar mechanic to prevent skill point farms from extracting 100% of the skill points they produce. Injectors can continue to do the same thing they do now, but a little slower. This will retain their function as a means to close the gap for newer players while taking away 3-day-old super pilots.
---
Not directly. I'm sure someone clever could look at player counts and the ocassional data on accounts per real player and omega:alpha ratios and extractor and skin sales ingame and make some general educated guesses though.
---
Yep. I to have joined the alpha Titan club!
---
Will keep my main guy, and all the Titans, Supers,  Rorquals, cynos will go to sleep till alliance needs them.   
---
The meta will crystallize in time I expect.  
---
Will see if it’s any fun when it gets here.
---
If your entire fleet is already so set up as to be in system, with many dictors bubbling both their beacon, bridge, every gate, and the grid itself, then you have likely already won.  This is the best case scenario for the attackers.
---
&gt; Capital blobs are never going away until rorqual spam is fixed,
---
Capital blobs existed for nearly a decade prior to the rorqual changes. Supercapital blobs about half that.
---
&gt;  Ie someone who casually plays that could be a stretch.
---
Casually plays but multiboxes Rorqs?  That doesn't seem cost effective at all.
---
naw you just write of the ship because fighting at the subcap on a field the attacker wants leads to even bigger losses.    Of course not always but for small groups 30 t3 or such is never going to go well.
---
Nice! Hell, maybe they could let us make our own space complexes like what we find in deadspace. That would be fun!
---
Ok, can I have your stuff after you sarcastically unsub?
---
imagine crying this much over a 400m recon to cyno in infinity supers to auto win fights
---
just delete supers
---
Boom !
---
I always thought that station guns would shoot at an aggressive person if they targeted you with e-war modules in Low-Sec. I am currently trapped in a station by a near insta-locking interceptor, and the station guns completely ignore him. His buddies then undock and try to kill me. Is this like normal? Has it always been this way? I haven't played EVE in like 4 years so maybe things have changed.
---
No-no-no! That literally said “it is safer”. Safety and profitability are different beasts.
---
I actually just upgraded to an Astero 2 months ago and it was an expensive learning curve, so let me see if I can save you a bit of that frustration.  All this advice is based on exploration in dangerous space (Low/Null and WH). 
---
After losing a couple ships with a pure exploration fit, IMHO the best way to fit the Astero is for combat with an active tank and a mobile depot that you can swap in a relic or data analyzer as needed for sites.  This will keep you safe against basic hunters that might sneak up on you while hacking cans.  (Of course if a Tengu grabs you, you're still in trouble but at least you won't go quietly)
---
Also, for what it's worth, data sites tend to be much lower value.  My advice would be to prioritize relic sites and its related skills.

TIL Sunken Cost Fallacy...  this explains so much lol
---
I started eve mostly because i was totally faszinated by those giant battles where fucking large capital sized ships shoot each other into pieces. 
---
Now after several long years where i had the fun to take part in some of those battles with my titan, which was a hell of a way to get and i fucking loved every second of it, ccp is changing the meta counter capital. Riddiculous cyno inhibitor mechanics were one thing, and now this. How likely is it going to be that any attacker will use capitals now? How likely is it that any defender will stuff their citadels with those recon ships? 
---
No...capital gameplay will most likely not be dead, but become very unlikely to happen. So theres no more real reason to play since the thing i enjoy most will not happen enough to justify paying the accout.
---
Ok. I'm a very new player - just started last week. I've wanted to play Eve for a long time, but...life. The brutality of it was appealing to me.
---
From what I'm hearing, there are more kid gloves than the original - but what is this Chaos change? Cynos? Being new, I'm not exactly sure what these are. Are they changes making it tougher? Is Eve easier than it used to be?
---
Cheers.
---
You have no idea how I spend my time.
---
I've heard plenty of work arounds for ratting supers and rorqs, but I've yet to hear a reasonable solution for getting a super fleet on grid with another super fleet.  A brick tanked falcon will get alphaed.  Before you say warp to grid, go read my post history, because I'm sick of typing it out.
---
This is another "collateral damage" situation.
---
Unsupported supers are a mistake and deserve to die.
---
*forcing* it's players? I've never felt forced to shell up any money to get a leg up.
---
Tinfoil: CCP is giving the game a Viking funeral before it gets old, senile and microtransaction-ridden.
---
This is what Im afraid of. Considering Hilmar talked about how the 64bit client was what made him think they can get away with changes I dont think the entire plan is longer than 2 months. And in no way is that enough to actually formulate a long term plan. And ofc, if they actually had a plan they would most likely announce it because you always give good news before the bad.
---
My fear is that they will experiment for a year and during this time not actually fix any of the real issues. Instead they will try this soft reboot fueled by reddit cheers and the promise of the holy childrens return. But Im fairly certain that wont cover the loss and in a year were all sitting there with less people and more broken things than before. But ofc, PvPers will still cry wanting more advantages because NS adapted, atleast those that remained.
---
Sounds like you are just bad.
---
you're pretty smug for someone who's completely wrong
---
Make sure you when you undock you still don’t have a limited engagement timer with said person.
---
But mining isn't playing the game, it's staring at a screen. As a hunter do you ever potentially sit 24 minutes without touching anything? While mining sometimes that happens, you lock two targets start your lasers and now you sit until the hull is full. Let's pretend for a moment that pvp works the same way, and some times it does! They are called structure bashes. So let's pretend that all pvp is now structure bashes, over and over, and over. But with nobody managing the station. But you can't afk during the bash at all, can't watch Netflix, can't take a bathroom break because at any random moment NPCs might show up and randomly blap you. In this new pvp meta would you rebel against a change that made you have to be even more attentive? Want more changes that would actually make the monotony rewarding or at least more fun? Mining isn't playing the game, it's turning off your brain for a while. Mining sucks and thus why I don't mine.
---
Ganking mid incursion is suicidal, so it'd have to be before they start. Which gives you a few hours from when it spawns to get some shiny kills. 
---
Only time I've seen people caught is while moving stuff in bowheads or under-tanked over blinged fit ships. 
---
Many people just pay couriers to move their stuff too, which makes it a lot harder.
---
Yes. And not there.
---
Exactly.   Band together with other players to form a communication network, form standing defense fleets and be ready to light a cyno to drop on attackers.  
---
actually i did play, been playing since 2005
---
frigates have never been absolutely useless, and supers are not a dominion mistake at all
---
i could go on at more length about this but why bother? you just tried to climb to the high ground with one of the dumbest sentences i've ever read on /r/eve
---
Need to agree: the changes are definitely interesting. I have a lot of fun watching from outside.
---
In this thread stainguy forgets what support ships are, and how bomb runs are done..
---
That's lot of hate against absolute minority of ships.
---
You are writing from the perspective of one poor little guy.. But the problem arises from you and your thousands of internet spaceship friends who for years have dunked every single fucking entity who dared pop its head up in nullsec, until everyone was either blue or gone. Thus causing it to become extremely futile and boring to do sov... At least ccp is trying something new, and in my opinion it is a step in the right direction.
---
A funny analogy to your story is Trump complaining he can't take an aircraft carrier out for his Sunday afternoon fishing trip.. There are other ships than caps you know...
---
this is not what I was suggesting at all, it is not uncommon for people to have an alt that flies interceptors and can light cynos, so if I need one I can ask if anybody has one and 99 times out of 100 someone other than me can bring one of their own random alts in a ceptor with a cyno
---
&gt; It's just reached the point of hardly being fun anymore.
---
Saw the title and immediately assumed this was a stain post
---
You really have no idea how things are in Delve, do you?
---
Here's your homework for today. Find out what a "Locust Fleet" is.
---
So true it hurts!
---
Injectors are here to stay, better get used to it. Oh, and CCP has gameplay reasons for them as well btw, whether or not you agree with them.
---
Except all big blobs will have plenty of cynos on stamd by and all the small groups are fucked if they ever wamt to drop some dreads...
---
“With provided ships”
---
Except they're not the minority anymore. 
---
When you're literally filling 255 man fleets with titans, you have a fucking problem.
---
afaik, they just mean saving up all the SP they get for free from CCP events - no way to train unallocated SP 
---
if you're omega and you don't train for a while, CCP will reimburse you some unallocated SP for the time you didn't train while omega, but that's a different thing
---
That only happens if I shoot back at them right? I haven't aggressed them. I'm in an industrial doing courier missions.
---
Atm on the losing side which controls few system you always get some sort of activity because opposite side which is already outnumbering you will focus those few systems and get more lp for that (oplexing+tier bonus) Also bots. This already leaves defenders in a position where they cannot really do any offense and maneuvers because they they are stuck defending their base. Now you propose actually triple the effort needed to defend those systems which is bs im sorry. 
---
Less systems the side controls =&gt; easier defense and offense but less lp. Thats how it should be.
---
You didn't get in quick enough - someone got one in before your inoculation.
---
The OP is absolutely right though.
---
If they had a plan and  they had though this out the timeline for changes would of went this way.   
---
Blackout 
---
Cyno Changes 
---
then Rorq and Capital nerfs.
---
That's still not really a hard cyno.
---
A capital cyno has the EHE, which gives you at least 20 seconds to get a fleet through.
---
You sound salty, my dude.
---
Why not null-sec though? It became a lot more interesting like many say.
---
Procurers are real ships, and we don’t win all the time!
---
Thing is: I am not wrong.  
---
Multiboxing is one of the causes for the problems we have. Without it, injectors wouldnt pose that big of a problem.  
---
Naturally, without injectors, multiboxing wouldnt be that much of a problem either, yet, because it would take longer for the game to reach that point.  
---
Theres reasons why many games outright ban multiboxing, because it is unhealthy in the long term, even tho of course the extra money from more subs would greatly benefit the company while it lasts.  
---
And besides, yes, how'd you expect someone to behave if you dont bring any arguments, and instead behave rude yourself? :P
---
Docked ≠ undocked.
---
You should be safe docked. But not undocked.
---
It's not hard to understand is it?
---
Im not disagreeing with what NS was. But WHs are actually even worse isk faucets/capita and they need to be fixed aswell, doubt thats gonna change because its fk NS. Certain things could have changed with easier methods, I mean they fixed VNI with 1 patch, something they should have done years ago. Rorqs should have been what they are now 3 years ago. 
---
But the thing is, its CCP that delayed these changes, not us. And we are getting shat on for things that we didnt control. Not in that sense. We were given a template and we acted accordingly, CCP wanted titans online and we gave it to them, then we asked them to fix certain things so we can actually use them and instead we get this.
---
Its boring on a whole new level. I mean tidi isnt better but fozzie sov makes everyone cry.
---
Idk man.
---
And ye citas should have been limited. People act like we want them to remain in their current state when we are the ones who actually have to grind hundreds of them. Its just madness.
---
I can already see Panther fleets. God that shit would be awesome.
---
Lose not loose.
---
Honestly, I’m not sure off the top of my head. However, that interceptor should be taking aggro from the station guns unless you are a war target to him and his allies.
---
Someone used to post those here with good analysis, I think he pulled it off an Icelandic gov site. I’m not sure what’s available.
---
I do a lot of ore trading. I eventually ran into a competitor who was looking for me to subsidize what he was low on. Turns out his nearly unlimited supply of ore was being eaten away at so much he needed a second source.
---
I asked him what he'd pay. The prices he was paying for the original ore was so low I couldnt even usually get it myself for that short of firesales. Long story short, he was buying from some sort of botting group. That explained the prices.
---
I suspect your post will soon dissapear....
---
Keep fighting the good fight though mate!
---
light a cyno at 200km away. wont get blapped before ur own super fleet gets in on grid, enemy fibos take time to travel, and if you are jumping in your supers vs enemy supers you likely will already cyno in at range regardless of this change as this is what every single group does because its much much safer than cynoing in at 0.
---
And i just made a falcon with 288k ehp for only 350mil in about 3 minutes. Have fun alphaing 3-4 of those in the middle of a tidi super cap fuck fest.
---
and neither of us are qualified to super capital meta.
---
They nerfed those ships first tho. And honestly, nerfing them again means people wont use them. Rorqs are rather shit now, especially since you cant even use excavs on them anymore. And I mean, sure its an idea but wouldnt call it a plan. A plan requires some thinking, imo.
---
I feel like it should be able to fit to frigates, but perhaps make the T1 version not, and make a T2 version that is significantly more expensive that can fit on a frigate, so you can still have a fast, reliable cyno, but it will cost you to use it
---
Doing some activities, 10 hours per week can easily cover the cost of a subscription. EVE is about risk vs reward, so keep that in mind!
---
As a free player, your skills are soft capped to 5 million skill points, after which point you can't train over time anymore (unless you pay for a subscription) then hard capped to 20 million skill points. Hitting the 5 million SP soft cap takes ~200 days at the free player training speed. Going from 5 million to 20 million takes another ~350 days at subscribed player training speeds (without implants) or ~300 days using "alpha injectors."
---
As you can see, it takes a *long* time to hit the caps free players have, so you don't have to worry about them!
---
What you are limited to as a free player is that while you can use everything from frigates to battleships, you're limited to the "T1" and "faction" variants - cheaper hulls with fewer (or different) bonuses and requiring fewer skills to use than "T2" or "T3" variants. You will still be able to use most "T2" modules to equip these ships, however. As an example, you would be able to use a T1 exploration frigate, the "Imicus," but you would not be able to use that frigate's T2 variant, the "Helios," which has stronger bonuses to scanning and is capable of using covert-ops cloaking devices (while also being about 100 times more expensive at current market prices).
---
If you like, I put together [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCLEGcYWtU7bN9gL-a_MolOCHmgJobtC_XyIKqBGXU0/edit?usp=sharing) a while back with all of the skills alpha accounts can train and marked them with what I consider to be the most important and least important skills for a new player.
---
Kthxbai.  Don't let the door hit you in your ass on the way out.
---
They said chaos change
---
Not “give pvpers even more kills” change
---
Salvage the orcas and pick their ore up. Will probably make mor than a few hours of hs mining at least
---
much love
---
Highsec is crap.....
---
No, we don't need characters in supers or titan. We need them in t1 cruisers and BC's, out creating content and being content. We don't need them injecting strait in to the aids that is rorqs, titans and supers.
---
I mean, the goal shouldn’t be (and I don’t think it is) to make caps useless. The problem with them, which they are evidently at least attempting to fix is their instant availability to any combat grid, even while they are supposed to be the slowest and least applicable “Fast response” ship in the game.
---
delete all subcaps then nobody will cry about caps
---
200 ships of any kind are deadly to some lonesome targets. Bombers can be killed easily though in comparison to the 20 supers that get cynoed in in top of you in your home called delve. 
---
Covert cynos are in a good state right now and will be after the change.
---
You do know who olmeca gold is right?
---
Yeah if I already have probes I'm scanning anything in the system. If I don't already have them I can't be bothered to go get them for a kestrel and I'll assume it's just pos trash somewhere.
---
the random window stuff you're thinking of is pocos.
---
Too late tbh
---
We already have tons of roqual and super pilots made by injectors
---
Even if we simply remove injectors from the game now, ppl still can buy chars from characters bazaar so nothing changes. (We will not gain newbros to absorb readymade chars honestly)
---
I just miss the era before injectors
---
but, there is nothing we can do now about injectors unless CCP wants to make fresh server
---
Drone Regs are shit and the big part of what makes them shit is absence of NPC space. 
---
Provi, Delve, Catch, Fountain, Tribute all benefit from relatively simple logistics and lots of groups being based nearby. Drone Regs are shit on the other hand in every way except to turbo crab in. 
---
Removing NPC stations from null would just make that space and extension of null bloc space.
---
Came here to say this. I could tolerate him as a meme, but no it’s just straight garbage 24/7
---
As i have already stated, the nerf goes too far which is the crux of my arguement, yes.  You can brick tank a falcon to have nearly 300k ehp. have fun alphaing that before they bridge reinforcements in w/ a fax and 1-2 additional brick falcons.
---
How is a baiting with a bricked t3c any different than that same group baiting with a cloaked falcon on grid? I'd argue its actually worse to use the t3c in this cause because you can literally tell its bait by looking at the model.
---
Its not impossible to tell if someone is baiting you.  Have better intel and better intuition; understand your enemy.  Will you always know? of course not, that is a part of the 'chaos' isnt it :)?
---
Again you can brick tank a falcon to have nearly 300k ehp for 350mil. Took me 2 minutes to slap the fit together.
---
A low sec gate to stain would be in lane with the chaotic nature of the game!
---
It will be glorious if the shut down all sec status a week or month prior and let us rampage and destroy every asset in the game. It can be the Ragnarok release (has that been used, yet?).
---
I just began with “they are not OP”. 
---
This is me with my own view and opinion on the issue, not some Narrative. I’m actually a wormholer. Yes, while they have a jump drive that is dandy. However, the entirety of eve is balanced around bigger ships being slower and having worse application, until it comes to caps. Whereas caps are largely used as the SOLE “fast response” ship. Which is entirely ass-backwards compared to the rest of the balance, marketing, and gameplay in eve.
---
None of the ships that will be able to light cynos are considered "tackling" ships, except the Arazu. Heavy Interdictors are to hold things, not catch them.
---
Can get an instawarp jackdaw with light missiles that can comfortably run things too and the gate camps are less of an issue.
---
The duration of the timer was determined by the amount of stront in the stront bay. This amount could be changed as long as the shields were above 50%. It was a good mechanic because it gave both the defenders and the attackers interesting decisions to make during an attack. Two simple rules lead to a great complex interplay between attackers and defenders.
---
You'd start with a default stront level. Bad pos owners would just max time it. Better owners would set a fixed time based on the assumed time their enemies would hit that pos. A few, particularly during wartime, would adjust the timers as often as possible.
---
If the expected attacker hits during their prime time the defender does nothing so the tower will come out of reinforced at the expected time.
---
The attacker has other options though. 
---
They can attack at an unusual hour, now if the defender does not act, the tower will come out at an unexpected hour. Once the defender gets there they need to choose a new timer for the tower. Because it can only be adjusted while above 50%, there is limited time to do this. Defenders can also guess that this might happen and leave towers pre-timed to plan for this and not have to do anything.
---
The attacker can also kite the tower. By shooting it to under 50% shields and holding it there the timer can no longer be adjusted. If they hold the tower under 50% for 6 hours, the duration doesn't change so the tower comes out of reinforcement 6 hours later than the defenders wanted. The defenders have plenty of time in this period to form a fleet and fight over the tower, or they can guess that a kite might happen and so have the tower pre-timed for it.
---
Many of the biggest, most interesting, and most impact fights happened as the result of one side forcing a timer fuckup on another.
---
The battle for 1V-, the first time that Goons lost an entire fleet to a doomsday(surprise!) happened when TCF woke up early one morning to reinforce the towers there leading to US timers instead of EU.
---
The battle of DG, where LV lost their capital fleet happened as the result of Goons faking a timer mistake. Instead of US prime the towers came out just after downtime. Russian prime.  Red Alliance had not been previously involved in the war so LV went in heavily not expecting the capital drop.
---
Sure it's not like HICs are stupidly tanky already
---
This x1000. Super looking forward to the era of blops. Getting dropped on by a few blops is actually a fight instead of insta-gank from caps.
---
I'm not arguing one way or another. It was a guess why they did not include them.        
---
It could also just be more complicated than just using an already existing ship class as restriction.
---
This is a shit post, not a shitpost. Learn the difference
---
A challenger approaches
---
Dude..an instant cap umbrella escalation is far more risk averse than any nano gang. I don’t even fly nano often, I had previously just stopped roaming null altogether because every single fight would get cyno escalated. We are even talking about the RARE sub vs sub fight here. 
---
Roaming brawler sub fleet and locals try to blob you in subs? You pull ahead and start getting kills then suddenly you’ve got a dozen titans on grid with you. That’s not fun for anyone, not even the dude with a Boson.
---
If we do 500v500 bomber fights there's no way we won't get at least some bomb hits. Could turn into a very interesting test case for manual piloting by individual linemembers, since there's no decent way to anchor a fleet like that &amp; individuals or small squads would have to line up their own bomb runs.
---
You have my CSM vote my liege
---
High sec belts aren't full of ventures though. They're full of orcas. Ventures can't do ice either. 
---
Also none of this changes the fact that bits weren't running l4 security missions em masse
---
Yea I mean, it worked great for the Chinese server when everyone worked together. For sure was not detrimental at all to the game.
---
Good post stainguy. 
---
I think this may actually be a big enough change that the "poor" that you reference may just quit altogether. While the cyno nerf is great for hunters, if they have even less targets to hunt, thats not so great.
---
Yep.  Pretty much this.  
---
Independent of the changes, I think most upsetting is the real change in the interaction between CCP and the player base as a whole.  
---
For good or for ill, CCP has taken a very measured and collaborative approach with the players who have invested so much time and money into the game.  Measured iteration, discussion and a thoughtful approach has softened what were real changes to gameplay over the years.  A sense of ‘team building’ between the devs and players is very unique to Eve.  This really has changed.  
---
Some people love it.  Burn it all down!
---
Others...not so much.  
---
From my point of view it just shifts Eve from a unique game where players and Devs exchanged ideas on the game, to just another top down MMO which decides to change things without explanation, warning or discussion.   
---
The optics of the recent changes are one of ‘we really don’t give a shit about your game play, because we know what’s best. HTFU and git gud’.  Trying to echo the meme of the in game narrative of Eve being harsh.  Again, this will play well to some people, but to others it’s adversarial vibe just pisses you off.  
---
Oh well...time will tell.  My only advice is to not throw the baby out with the bath water, unless you really hate the baby and hope to replace it with more better babies. :-)

---
I was replying specifically to the comment, not to the topic. It would be nice if you guys didn't foam at the mouth so frequently.
---
That has nothing to do with these changes.  Making it a nuisance means people like me with 30+ accounts will shrug it off under a super umbrella
---
People who think eve can be won by ganking pveing subcaps will continue to cry no matter what changes come period.
---
the sov issue has nothing to do with caps.  If the “elite” pvp hunters spent even 1/5 the time they do desperately hunting vnis and barges mining themselves, they’d have their own throwaway dreads or even supers.
---
Because they don’t WANT to do that, they cry because it’s effort they don’t want to spend to compete.  While that’s respectable to a degree, what is unacceptable is the fact that they do this under the guise of “balance” and “game health”
---
It’s a never ending cycle of crying that won’t change until they get their playstyle to be the winning one because it’s what they WANT to do.
---
But to those like me who have many accounts... it’s what i WANT to do.  I joined eve literally wanting to build titans even 13 ish years ago.  It’s what i enjoy.  I enjoy “macro” style pvp, others enjoy “efficient” pvp.
---
That’s their choice.  And it’s mine as well.  You do not get to win because you don’t “want” to counter other playstyles in ANY sandbox pvp.  Eve unfortunately his devs on the balance side that play on the opposite end of the spectrum.
---
It won’t affect me, i’ll adapt and change my playstyle as long as multiple accounts are allowed.  Others will to.  If they take that away then they can enjoy an empty eve because i know i’m not alone.
---
But ... to those who want to kill things in subcaps.  
---
To those who want to kill things in space people have spent 10s of trillions building up
---
To those who want to kill things under capital umbrellas.
---
Counter it knowing that’s what you’re going against.  And if you don’t want to, shut up about it or find another target
---
This pathetically weak “its ooooopeeeee plz nerf so my frigate gang can get ez kills” is just.... sad.
---
Your specific ideas aren’t great, but the concept is good. The topography of New Eden certainly rewards turtling and is the big reason why low sec is underused.

Based on what I’ve seen, doing HR in my alliance, illegal character sales are still happening as it is much cheaper to buy a character for real money than to inject one. I can see your point that injectors may have reduced some demand but it is an ongoing problem that has in no way been fixed by injectors.
---
One might even think that they don't read that much either, since they often require one to put a "/s" below the comment to demostrate the sarcastic intention... a resource I've never seen actually used in books. Weird.
---
I dont think this change was terribly thought through tbh.  If it was there'd be no reason why to every give blops bs a cyno, and cyno duration would have been reduced from the start.
---
And what do you mean?
---
K thanks for reminding absolutely nobody
---
Bring an alt in a recon ship along for a cyno. Or a bomber, or a blops battleship.  Or a cov ops frigates. There are a dozen options for various cyno types. Just means we actually have some risk when hunting supers. If there's any still outside.
---
It's chaos man, it's fun. I just subbed 4 more accounts
---
You see the tag and you think i am an alliance. A lot of hate. Cute.
---
&gt; If anything, these alliances have done little more than crap on "the little guy" with every means at their disposal in game or otherwise.
---
* perhaps read the CSM minutes but i will give you a hint hisec wardecs on noob corporations without structures have been stopped by the CSM , the rest you read for yourself.
---
* secondly if no small groups our fun stops as they quit. Player make chaos , CCP are making half thought "tweaks" . Have you seen that all their tweaks is remiving things from game and not actually building new stuff. aka local chat removed in nullsec and now just some code for cyno... 
---
* i dont care but the actual statistics are showing that less things are killed in nullsec due to blackout and the shit OP drifter invasion (go do some proper research for yourself i am actually quite tired of pointing you towards critical thinking skills)
---
* if no little guy no content or chaos, only big blocks remain. Also this hurts new players that i do care about since its very hard now to train and help them get off the ground.
---
Please more thinking less hate because of the tag, you are all so fucking predictable.
---
You sound childish, dude
---
but if they find it fun why not.   Log in mine for a bit call it good.   Log in go PVP for a bit why not.    Log in explore a bit  why not. 
---
The key with this change is it forces another account to do what your already doing and incurrs a cost of plex that or another subscription.
---
People said we'd have less targets because of blackout. Yet here we are.
---
lol another useless salty post
---
I mean recons are under represented in your standard fleet comp.... maybe 1 or 2 Huggins and a lach. 
---
Now were gonna have 10 recons per fleet minimum.
---
Yes, and there is a TOS provision that prohibits impersonating another character, corporation or alliance. 
---
Specifically:
---
&gt; You may not impersonate or falsely present yourself to be a representative of another player, group of players, character or NPC entity.
---
Not that either, my corp has zero war-decs, I don't get why the station guns aren't shooting him. I always assumed they would shot at you for doing anything aggressive in nature to a non-hostile player. My security status is positive as well. 0.4 system.
---
    EAT MAILBOX
---
&gt;possibly rethink sentry guns and the security status of lowsec to make the system relevant instead of a nuisance to be overcome with remote reps
---
Totally down with getting rid of them. They don't stop gank fleets but they make solo fight picking impossible.
---
I could see making null into a sphere with empire in the center. Squishing the space so the game feels smaller would be a problem for me, though. Some gates on the fringes should be sufficient. There shouldn't be restrictions to caps, though. The attacker in a SOV war would be at a huge disadvantage.
---
Then you are playing eve wrong.  in my 15 years here i have never had an issue getting the money i need for a ship, and as i do what i like doing, its never been a grind.  If you are grinding for money, then you are definitely doing it wrong.
---
What good is that income if you dont spend it? Lose shit on fleet and strat ops, SRP. Do you just like big dicking with your wallet? When I lived in null I didnt pve and I still had so much isk I bought ludacrisly blingy shit just cuz I could. 
---
Between srp and insurance you shouldn't need to defend every rorq and super ratter. Let some burn. Quit being a pussy. And in the great wise words of some beautiful capsuleer from long ago Harden The Fuck Up. 
---
It's like every fucking carebear has just lost all their income when that isnt the case. You arent piss poor you have plenty of isk on reserve quit being a baby and lose some of it. It literally does you nothing if it just piles up indefinitely.
---
&gt;As i have already stated, the nerf goes too far which is the crux of my arguement, yes.
---
There is disagreement if it goes far enough.
---
&gt;You can brick tank a falcon to have nearly 300k ehp. have fun alphaing that before they bridge reinforcements in w/ a fax and 1-2 additional brick falcons.
---
Yeah, that would be difficult, so we should limit the ships to the ones proposed.
---
&gt;How is a baiting with a bricked t3c any different than that same group baiting with a cloaked falcon on grid?
---
I can think of a few reasons, but you are the one arguing for it. If you say there are no/few differences, why do you want it?
---
&gt;Its not impossible to tell if someone is baiting you. Have better intel and better intuition; understand your enemy. Will you always know? of course not, that is a part of the 'chaos' isnt it :)?
---
That's unfalsifiable and can apply to any situation - "as long as you always win, you never lose, so nothing is overpowered!".
---
&gt;Again you can brick tank a falcon to have nearly 300k ehp for 350mil. Took me 2 minutes to slap the fit together.
---
So what does a t3c offer that a recon does not?
---
shut up hilmar
---
You asked me but everyone else answered you so, now you know :)
---
POS made the best content. This citadel shit we have now is hopeless.
---
Low sec? Low sec is trash.
---
I mean it's so garbage that it has local
---
Enjoy your ban NERD
---
Yeah, really all we need to do is wait and see.
---
Yeah, I think I'll go command burst for my titan, already trained him up for it, might as well use it.
---
This is fucking brilliant.
---
Exactly what I was looking for &lt;3.
---
cool stuff. thx a lot man. o7
---
Hate to say it - but this would hold down capital use a LOT.  Only in the most important situations would they get dropped.  
---
Of course with injectors the isk-rich could still get back up to skill quickly.
---
&gt;I give it another year before you're bored of EVE on easy mode and aren't active anymore.
---
Being able to fly ships I like = easy mode? Okay...
---
But I am glad that having this skills learned without injectors making you so proud. Fly safe too. o7
---
This increases cost of lighting a cyno. Nothing more or less.
---
I mean it's pretty bullshit that camera drones are immune to all damage, if you think about it.
---
Hi Todd, Miss you &lt;3
---
Yeah I was just pointing out how it should of went.  Right now they are flying by the seat of their pants and have no clue to what they are doing.    
---
also when I mention the capital nerf they could of evaluated if they were even needed.  I think the capital nerfs get rolled back in 2 years somewhat.   Nerfs made sense somewhat prior to black out and cyno changes but not so much anymore.
---
Jesus fucking christ.
---
&gt;light a cyno at 200km-300km away. wont get blapped before ur own super fleet gets in on grid, enemy fibos take time to travel, and if you are jumping in your supers vs enemy supers you likely will already cyno in at range regardless of this change as this is what every single group does because its much much safer than cynoing in at 0.
---
Long range Titans (or dreads) will absolutely blap, shield extended, big sig having, cyno subcap doing 0m/s at 200km-300km.  There is a reason we use a cyno ceptor or nullified T3C to bring in a capital cyno before we bring the main fleet, instead of just trying to jump the main fleet to a subcap cyno.
---
&gt;And i just made a falcon with 288k ehp for only 350mil in about 3 minutes. Have fun alphaing 3-4 of those in the middle of a tidi super cap fuck fest
---
Everyone is in tidi, including the falcons, which will probably get blapped before the client ever indicates that they are decloaked.
---
&gt;i dont feel ur qualified to discuss supercap blob meta, not that i am either.
---
Maybe I am, maybe I'm not, but I've actually spent a decent amount of time in supercap fleets in tidi. The convoluted ass shit we do to get on and off grid is all there for a reason, and it all makes perfect sense after you see it a few times.
---
We are already changing doctrines with huggin and lach to rapier and arazu. Not much involved in it really
---
Blame Millenials. Back in my day ...
---
Well this isn't a first person dig fighting type of game, your piloting a ship with advanced technology so I would imagine that if your were inside the ship  there's a shit ton of stuff from sensors. Change it to first person only and hell yeah kill the overview.
---
Lol, do you know if there’s a way to check what corp names are available either online or in game?
---
My body is ready
---
If you think this nerf isn't already sweeping youre fooling urself. The only thing they could do is add a spool up time for cynos.  Anything more completely invalidates using/owning/building any capital ships at all.
---
Falcon is one of the proposed ships to that can light a cyno.  You can also get up to 415k ehp for 1bil, and thats not even a min/maxed fit.
---
And im advocating for it because having multiple options on how you use your cynos is a good thing.  BLOPS bs are irrelevant no one will every use them, so theres effectively only 4 ships that can light cynos.  Im of the opinion that this is far too restrictive.
---
Maybe you deserve to lose sometimes? If you wanna talk hypothetical engagements i can go all day, the fact of the matter is that saying t3c cynos are bad because they could be bait is a bad arguement.
---
t3c offers nullified warps, having cynos on actual PVP ships that can do more things than just decloak cyno, the capability to refit, as well as not limiting cynos to only 4 ship hulls.
---
They should restrict them to subcaps and increase fitting to the point it can't be fit on anything smaller than what they decide is the minimum be that destroyers or cruisers. It would force you to make choices when fitting a cyno, what should I lose? Tank, utility, damage, etc. Additionally it should require more capacitor to use and have a shorter duration. Neut the cyno and it can't light it or cycle after the current one. Even a BS has to chose cap and cyno, cyno and tank, cyno and DPS? Make us have to make more decisions not make less.
---
i love your albion builds
---
Keep crying.
---
What's the point of using an unprobeable ship in a probeable site
---
I did say fleets, yes? I did not say anti-social shut in multiboxing 50 accounts.
---
Oh man! A decision with consequences!
---
delete all ships and we can all weeble around in space
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKcAWO_IznI
---
It will be come September. Unless you have something with more ehp in mind
---
A few years ago caps were nerfed because they had insane jump ranges now you wana go back to being able to jump anywhere?
---
Lol new meta is cheap ratting ships that are not fun targets and are easily replaceable. Vexor and myrms will be the only things you see. Better bring webs and a scram just saying
---
I actually think they'll let this one slip through, at least for a time.
---
It feels like the point of the chaos project is to collect data on our reactions. For a time (probably a few more months) we're all going to be Pavlov's dogs. I assume that they'll see what each change wrought and then come back with a balance pass. They've been staggering the rollout, so I guess they are trying to isolate our behaviors to each discrete change.
---
I'm OK with that. I'm interested in seeing how things shake out, myself.
---
No, not all of them.
---
my mining ledger disagree with you.
---
To catch capitals, yes, not to bring some on grid.
---
[Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrW6p5ns8K8)
---
you're very good at posting and you should know that
---
Except that CCP has no incentive to make it so that players don't need a ton of SP to do the fun shit.
---
Think of old entosis module: can´t recieve remote reps while cyno is lit
---
&gt; Multiboxing is one of the causes for the problems we have
---
it's also a core tenet of eve online gameplay so like
---
let's also remove drones because those are a problem too right?
---
First off, I never even mentioned you specifically. Second I didn't single out Goons but grouped them in the "large alliance" category. Third, I never said it wouldn't impact smaller groups. Everything does. As for training new players, they don't even have the skills to really notice any difference from this.
---
Lastly, my point still stands (as stated) that the large alliances suddenly being worried about "the little guy" is simply bs. 
---
Not everything is a personal attack so just chill.
---
I'd cut all the regional superhighways if I got a chance to make a change
---
If the Corp name you want is already taken, just keep adding dots until it isn't.
---
CCP Rise “it’s sort of about umbrella disruption.”  So if you know “why they did this” I would have confidence that you’d be able to articulate it rather than just alluding to it.  CCP is a business which means profit is the only goal...anyone that tells you otherwise does not know business.  That said, what are the revenue streams for CCP?  Plex, subscriptions and injectors.  It is reasonable for one to correlate the business goal with the visible product and thus no tinfoil hat is needed when deciphering the reasons behind business decisions.  In game tweaks, balances, fixes, and major changes all are done under the umbrella of the standard business goal of profit first...skill injectors, in my estimation, have been a significant revenue stream for this company and to deride someone for making the completely true and logical claim regarding injector sales efforts shows a certain bias or potentially defensive behavior that may not be entirely healthy on your part.
---
Do rorquals still have the industrial ship restriction on their Ship Bay?  
---
\- if not, then HumpbackRiding.
---
It has nothing to do with how skilled attackers are. This is entirely about being sick of the slowest ships in the game being the fastest and simplest fast-response ship.
---
Caps should not be able to provide an instant umbrella at all times without risk. Don’t make that BS organization argument about competent players, because there’s no realistic reason you should even lose caps under your umbrella if you have a couple semi afk fax pilots around.
---
Now, I’m not arguing for them to be nerfed directly. Hell, I actually think it’d be cool if supers got buffed and titans got more direct dps such as point defense weaponry. 
---
What I was suggesting originally was that it should be possible to counter a cyno and make the defender RESPOND to the grid first. Instead of simply uncloaking a corvette, or a recon (with upcoming change) I would rather you have to undock in the Local DEFENDER system, or cyno/gate to that system remotely in some way. 
---
The goal of the above is NOT to get “Muh easy nano kills”. What I would like to see from such a change is more subcaps be forced to undock and either warp in and protect the cyno ship somehow, or kill the inhibitor etc. Assuming you achieve your defense goals of getting the cyno online then you can drop your titans on the attacking fleet. 
---
Meanwhile, the attacker is likely going to be more happy about the opportunity to hold the grid and fight off/kill the incoming defender subcaps. Instead of “easy kills” I was trying to come up with an idea to actually create more conflict and tactical options towards controlling a grid to have cap superiority. OR just go the lazy route and allow the old cyno mechanics but the incoming cyno ship lands nearby, off grid. Allowing bubble trap counterplay. If your 10 Nyx, Erebus, or Naglfars etc warp in and land in a bubble 200km off you will have to fight/reward from there, OR establish grid dominance (killing bubbles or bubblers) BEFORE warping the caps in.
---
Lo lolol more cit span here i come
---
Now THAT would be a good idea
---
Or all you left with to cry about will be caps.
---
i didn't intended to came across like that, it's a fun fit for a small gang, can probably make it work with as little as 3 pilots, give it a try it's fun and actually very easy to execute
---
You think I give a shit what you braindead retards think? If so, biomass yourself tbh.
---
Anyways, watching the player numbers and activity drop is pretty funny, enjoy being a retarded faggot with the rest of them.
---
Why are you booing him, he’s right
---
I agree in so far as the reason for making isk is fighting.  That is absolutely the game and always has been.  I appreciate the people who want to mine because it provides minerals to make fights.
---
Those fights are heading toward being a LOT more expensive though.  That expense will be a big deterrent for those that have to worry about isk.  if you got a tech II bpo back in the day (talking to you mario, you muppet) or you can just spend the money to buy plex without a problem, then you won't get it, but it is real.
---
if you can make 80 million a day(market?), you can powerlevel your skills with the 50k alpha boost
---
Which is silly. People buying plex ro use for game time and not to sell in game is stupid. Plex cost more then a normal sub to start with.
---
Why? Are you sad? Did something happen?
---
Why not apply this to anything with a cloak or t2 as well!
---
I like where this idea is going, but I'm not entirely sure about frigate size. 
---
Perhaps they can add something like a second command dessie for each race that is specifically a cyno ship, or something to the effect of a monitor for cynos?
---
Of course not. It's incredible to me how people don't understand that CCP is a company and every company in history is driven by profit to survive. Of course they want to increase revenue.
---
Contract it to me and I'll appraise it for you.
---
He isn’t wrong though there’s data that supports null activity from human players is significantly lower. For the small circle of friends you have sure that’s fine, but it shouldn’t be only about the 3-5 dudes. How about small alliances that have no cap umbrella? Or finances to SRP unlimited recons?
---
Have you looked at adm and dotlan activity in Catch and other regions lately? The fish is gone. 
---
On zkb MoM there are increases on excavator drone kills, other things like capital losses and Rorq losses — I see a degradation in the number of kills. There’s less fish. Roams are taking longer. It’s a sad state for the bear and the hunter.
---
&gt; Funnily enough, that's probably the 1 thing you can't tackle (or anyone else for that matter, in FW anyway).
---
I am happy to open your eyes on some mechanics: you can fit more then one scram in ship. Don't tell anyone.
---
Was just looking for example of useless and almost harmless ship that can be tackled by frigate trained for 1 day.
---
&gt;If a 1 day newbro joins a FW alt, they can have an impact on the fight, fighting small shit day 1.
---
So, it's no more "good tackle frigate"?
---
&gt;And honestly, I still don't think it's going to be much of an issue until CCP nerf's PANIC.
---
Well, I am not saying it solving problem. Just saying that it shift balance a bit in a way of solving it.
---
&gt;What if I get 2-3 blingy ships on my alts? 
---
Still can be killed by 5-6 not blingy ships. Yes, you'd have advantage, but you need to have good piloting skills to use it and I am fine with it. If you can comfortably fly 2-3 ships - you have high chance to beat me with or without blinging them.
---
&gt;What if I get a super?
---
I'll just not fight with it. But there's a lot of people who would. And here you also need skills to not arrive on kb very fast, there's a lot of people who like to kill supers.
---
&gt;I can also use this ISK for a lot more than just buying and exploding ships.
---
We are talking about advantage you can get with your 10 Rorqs. And so far you just confirm my idea that there's "sanity limit". You can not fight with 10 ships as efficient as you can with 1-2. And if you do - you will have advantage with or without Injectors.
---
&gt;but until you reduce the infinite anoms, or find another way to spread ratters/miners across space
---
No one promised to solve it at once. But it's moving in good direction and we can be happy about it.
---
Lol hilariously bad post.
---
Please limit how many can be anchored for true meme
---
Exactly, that’s why I’m not even entirely happy with this change myself. I like the attempt and what they are trying to do, but it needs some tuning. Personally I want someone to be forced to secure or fight for the grid with ships already in the local system. Then once they have adequate dps etc on grid (subcaps) they could bring caps in to secure or finish up the fight.
---
Injectors should not work on capital skills. New players can "catch up" all they want for sub caps but caps should have to be trained.
---
Not this my friend is some top tier thinking
---
It's almost 100% bullshit every time somebody says "I'm unsubbing all my accounts and quitting!"  It's the EVE equivalent of saying you're moving to Canada if X person is elected president.
---
Yes new players notice....  try training 20 or so...
---
Whatevs keep your opinion, its fine.
---
I'll be back valk, once the last payment is done and the keys on the house are ours i'll be resubbing the next day
---
and he should rise like a dragon!
---
How is this a bad thing, exactly?
---
This sounds more like an argument to limit what skills injectors apply to than to get rid of them altogether.
---
I know I'm still months from my skills being better than bare minimum in any ship, and I'm probably a half year at least before it would be anywhere close to worthwhile for me to undock anything above T1.  I'm at a disadvantage to more experienced players in every ship I fly both numbers-wise and ability-wise.  To accomplish anything in this game without my fleet/corp carrying me I need to outplay people who have years of experience to my months flying ships that, even if we use identical hulls, are numerically superior carrying modules that are straight upgrades to the modules I can use.  It would be several months of subscription fees before I could narrow even a few match-ups down to only being a matter of experience.
---
I probably won't buy injectors, but at this point I'd have to pay for months worth of subscription fees before I see a significant change in PvP.  Maybe an unwillingness to pay for several months before anything changes in "the fun part" means Eve isn't my kind of game, but that doesn't exactly encourage newer players to stick around.  I won't say skill injectors are a perfect fix or even a particularly good one, but some sort of catch up mechanic, or some change that reduces the raw wait time, needs to exist if you want the population to grow, even if it also helps established players who decide they want to make an alt account.
---
You're welcome. PM me if you need examples of hybrid exploration/combat fits for Astero or you have more questions.
---
You misspelled "better", my dude.
---
100% agree with this guy \^ It's definetly not pay to win, i can still wreck 500m ships in my 10m one.
---
Oh man, if there were only other forms of generating isk in the gam... wait.
---
Adapt or die, and not a troll answer, just as a reminder that the ability to adapt to a new meta, mechanics or circunstances has aways been at the core of EVE.
---
There were a lot of ways of making good isk before Rorqs and ratting supers, and those still exist and new ways will surely be found.
---
What you dislike is not the cyno changes, is being taken out of your comfort zone and (god forbid) having to actually take some risk instead of sitting there in your isk printing machine.
---
We agree to disagree.
---
this would have a bigger impact than the changes we face atm. Actually this would not even tank PCU like the changes we face do atm.
---
People tend to be that way when given minimal info to judge a situation on lol
---
What even. Guess I'm anchoring 10 more sotiyos. Have fun with that structure grind
---
Even the most highly skilled veteran can still only fly one ship at a time. With the exception of supercapitals, nearly any single ship can be trained in a relatively short time. The ones that can't typically have lots of other ships that you'll unlock on the way to training them. That means that, before injectors, the only differences between a veteran and a relative newbie who has trained their ship properly are that the veteran has more versatility and in game experience.
---
WOW isn't a first person dog fighter game either is it, same for all the other RPGs. None of them have overviews or similar... Name me another game that has an overview?
---
lmao dude, this is exactly the tinfoil shit I'm talking about. 
---
Its a game. 
---
It has to be fun to play to make any money. 
---
They are shaking up the game and seeing what sticks because the status quo now is not fun. Get your head out of you ass and stop blaming "business goals" for balance changes you can't understand.
---
For fucks sake
---
Frat space was equally as bad.
---
Yes, sure.
---
This discussion is about whether we AGREE with CCP on that issue.
---
You're assuming you need a 2.5 bil blops.  You don't actually, you need a recon.  Your recon doesn't even need to die, just exercise a modicum of patience.
---
he was bombing bombers bar fleets as they warped to wormholes at one point.
---
There
---
You’re very welcome, kind sir.
---
But you were just arguing about how easy it is to multibox a cyno...
---
You're jumping all over the place.
---
Depends. I have a shitnton of ships and lose capitals a bunch I still find eve pvp the most enjoyable sitting in a thorax. People seem to equate fun to being in blingy ships and unless you're a 100% solo pvper I'd wager that is rarely the case. But then again i do enjoy small gang stuff the most in eve.
---
You mean PL?:p:)
---
Something something enjoy your ban stunt
---
Have you considered paying attention instead of just eternally AFKing?
---
Also, link lossmail.
---
The purpose of these changes are to make it a more active decision as opposed to a passive decision.
---
&gt;replaced my Covetors with fully tanked Procurers and put a remote rep on the Orca - and now I can kill even gangs of 6
---
So, in other words, you did the sensible thing, the thing you should have done anyways to prevent gankers.
---
Seems like a pretty good change to me.
---
Lol agreed biggest issue I ever had was when pods had levels and cost money. Can I afford to lose 10m isk cruisers(fit at the time) yes could I do that or use frigs and afford multi 80m per death pods nooooooo but that issue was thankfully solved and was one of the best changes ever.
---
No more or less than any other way. It's all about visibility.
---
I get it. You're sick and tired of failing to gank Ventures so you came here to suck at trolling instead. Whatever keeps you happy.
---
Yes. And now with Injectors newbie can catch up in versatility and try to catch up with experience. It's good, isn't it?
---
&gt; but if they find it fun why not.
---
I'm not saying they can't do it, just that if you're willing to pay multiple subscriptions and capable of affording to maintain and protect multiple Rorqs, even if you only occasionally take them out, you have somewhat exceeded casual play.
---
On top of that, with the amount of isk Rorqs pull in, I think the people running their own personal Rorq fleets could easily afford to plex another account and are just reluctant to spend their stockpiled isk on it.
---
&gt;Plus, a lot of newbros say this is a catch-up mechanic, which is partly true, but it also has widened the gap in-between a newbro and an experienced player. Experienced players have a lot more ISK and a lot more alts. They jumped much further than any newbro can ever catch up. An experienced player might have had 1 main and an ok alt and an alt they were training up. Overnight, they had 3 chars equivalent to their main. They could make a lot more ISK, a lot more quickly, which means more injectors, more alts and better ships, which means they continue going on much faster than a newbro. Instead of catching up to a player with 20-30 mil skillpoints, you are now catching up with one with 40-50 mil skillpoints, on multiple alts, that is always increasing faster than you can hope to reach.
---
This is fundamentally incorrect. There is a hard cap on how many subcapital characters a single real person can multibox effectively, and a hard cap on how many capital or supercapital characters a player can make use of at one time. 
---
With injectors it is possible to reach parity with a long-time player relatively easily: dual boxing subcaps on a serious fleet, once you have to competency to do that, is generally the max unless you also do links or a sabre alt, which only a few people in fleet need to have.
---
Sure you can inject four supercarrier pilots, but what does that actually get you? You're not going to be able to use more than 2 at any given time. Sure you can inject, buy some more titans, whatever you want. But your computer is going to catch on fire if you try and multibox 5 titans in the 1% TIDI, 6000 man brawl, and when you start disconnecting and either warping off to your death or generally being useless, what does it really matter?
---
As someone who has played for less than 2 years, I am a more useful pilot than plenty of 80m+ SP pilots because I can fly multiple roles, and fly them competently. The fact that I've been able to get dread and carrier alts in that time and get my main into some T3Cs, recons, and HACs means that I can afford to play with the big boys, because really those are all you need. And I have a lot more fun in this game because of the increased content options available to me, rather than if I was still trapped in in T1 cruisers and basic T2 frigates because that's all I would have SP for.
---
&gt;Mining sucks and thus why I don't mine.
---
Cool. Good for you. But some people enjoy being able to sit back and listen to a podcast or chat on comms without being distracted by hunting people.

Fake

I didn't choose the spod life. The spod life chose me.
---
the safety of wormhole isk will downvote you hard but i like it! EDIT: who thinks WH's are chaotic or dangerous straight out lies funfact 2019 after blackout.
---
I have my doubts as to ccp being able to pull it off without much talk with the CSM. So far, it looks like they've been ignoring the CSM.
---
his posting went from "haha that's so dumb" to "that's just fucking dumb"
---
ban? made this because a major indy dude was angry about the changes though it'd be funny to F12 it. and switch it up
---
Or to anything.
---
It seems only conflict of interest prevents a mostly unified "agree".
---
is joke please ignore
---
Basically EVE is a risk game. Unlike say in WoW, your death matters here. You will loose your ship. Eventually. And probably sooner rather than later. Therefore rule #1 of EVE is "don't fly what you can't afford to lose". So being space-rich actually means something. It means you manage to get more ISK than you lose. That also means that most rewarding content must also be the most difficult and risky.
---
But some people want to become space-rich without taking risk or putting effort into learning the game. So they pick some easy and safe activity which pays a lot and engage in that. Bonus points if that activity can be done AFK or automated. Of course others see that as sort of cheating, since it goes against the spirit of the game. Eventually developers nerf such activities and when that happens, lots of people become unhappy. Suddenly they either have to accept lower rewards or do something more challenging and risky. They take to the forums and cry about devs killing the game, etc, etc. Until they find another low effort low risk activity to engage in and the cycle starts over again.
---
EVE is going through one such shakeup right now, big changes are happening. So you will see a lot of people crying while at the same time others say it's the best thing that happened to EVE in past 10 years. If you stick around long enough, you will learn to enjoy those tears ;) Fly safe!
---
Leshaks would also be more problematic since old style would be gank the logi and watch the shiny nightmares and vindis die but leshaks would likely have re and be able to cover logi loss if needed.
---
Wew lad I think you need to take a break.
---
im up to 422k  ehp with t3c links (higher with titan phenom or cmd ship links and even more so with the release of shield salves). Sig of 245 meaning it will take a Sebo'd titan (assuming it locks the INSTANT it decloaks and the titan has long range ammo loaded and is ready to cycle which is not realistic if the titans are actively shooting things) over 6 seconds to lock. 6 seconds in tidi while the cyno is active, and if your capital staging system isnt in tidi itself is enough time to get the bulk of your fleet onto grid with extra backup cynos for the rest.
---
If you are lighting a cyno on grid raw vs an enemy capital fleet, then clearly you are making a mistake given these changes.
---
tidi supercap blob fests have been on their way out for a while now.
---
The CSM is also under NDA, so who knows whats going on currently.
---
I sincerely feel like you either didn't actually read my post or didn't read the one that I replied to...
---
If you have enough Tornadoes you should be able to alpha those Leshaks, if they are officer fit it should be worth it.
---
Quite right. We (PH) and several other null groups use the Drifter systems to fling dessy-down whaling fleets around the universe, but they're not good for much else.
---
I was just explaining to Finders what the previous poster was referring to.
---
can confirm is fake news. Wise eveonion had done it first honestly. Maybe next week?
---
Honestly tho these recent changes might actually be the thing that kills eve. Goddamn shame but ccp is taking away the fun gameplay and no one wants to play a boring game.
---
Step 1: Join corporation.
---
Step 2: Explode ships while making mistakes with said corporation.
---
Step 3: Learn from said corporation while training into better ships.
---
Step 4: Stop exploding (as many) ships because you're not a dunce.
---
You missed step 1 in both of your scenarios. Your step 1 on the 2nd scenario was to buy injectors. You are the reason micro-transactions exist in games.
---
I don't think that'd be a terrible thing, dessy or frigate should be sufficiently quick to keep up with any fleet, but I still dislike the idea that it's restricted to a particular, specific hull class. Eve is like a game of poker, especially with small groups and capitals, I feel like showing your hand to your enemy immediately is a little harsh.
---
Killing structures isn't always the goal when hitting them... sometimes you're just ringing the content doorbell
---
It's amazing how many people completely forget about the fact that we have ships literally designed to counter bombers.
---
Destroyers have Defenders, and they can move faster than bombers and will *absolutely* tear them apart if they get on top of them. But no, bombers OP because I can't just press one button to clear all of them off the grid.
---
Well you've given them the idea so may as well get them
---
More fun for you less fun for others.
---
I mean, you also have all the screeching retards here and on the CSM to blame for all the misdirection. Honestly if a little more than half of you would shut the fuck up about caps and learn to play instead of being shitty pilots, the game would be in a much better state.
---
You just have to skill yourselves.
---
And also what Defender Launchers are.
---
Rise knows when to use apostrophes.
---
Yea i seriously used to hate that cost.
---
I will rest, and look out upon a grateful universe.
---
and their 4 year old kids dont forget the new eve players when we dont grow them in our homes we won't have new players!
---
Scout the other side of the gate, without entering the system... that makes sense...
---
It’s a reference to Stunt getting banned for faking a dev comment/post
---
Oh damn, any idea what his name was or what the titles of his posts were?
---
Who?
---
agree he never got visited by Goons/Test or Panfam Bomber fleets xD
---
I got excited. Now I’m sad.
---
Your right
---
I agree, it pretty much allowed wealthy players (in game and out) to be able to move more quickly. Before CCP had time to fix things before they became horribly unbalanced, so they didn't have good strategies for fixing un-fun things. Injectors just made it worse, but the fact is CCP was terrible at it before injectors, and it's just really really obvious now.
---
I feel like the plan with the age of chaos is instead of tackling the problem they are just making changes even faster. I think this (while an interesting experiment) isn't a great way to do it because people can get burned out over too many changes, etc. (so far changes haven't been terrible, but if they keep re-balancing cynos every 3 months people are going to get annoyed eventually)
---
How does this fix the issue? The issue is that they don’t die and they have back up at the click of a button
---
Just saying, I'm glad we can at least discuss these issues. Even if CCP doesn't listen, we can at least discuss solutions.
---
At the very least, I do 100% believe rorquals should not be able to cyno. I say that as someone who uses a rorqual. Capitals in general shouldn't get cyno use ability.
---
Who knows, maybe CCP will listen and experiment a little more with something... Much less dramatic
---
~~I mean, this is how it used to work before Alpha Clones were a thing. You'd either sub a cyno alt or get a friend to help you.~~ Correction: Cynos need Omega to use. So your bitching and whining is pointless and you always needed to sub a second account if you wanted a cyno alt anyways. Lulz.
---
Capitals have always required support to work at full effectiveness, that's the point. Your big I-Win-Button shouldn't be able to do everything by itself.
---
I have to agree... next step for me is removing player data from the in game map...
---
Example:
---
no longer can you see how many jumps how many people in space or docked.
---
This will make hunting and being hunted at lot more guess work and force people to work in groups to stay alive or to get that juicy kill.
---
To be fair, industrials and mining barges probably don't need this.
---
Groups have different playstyles. Balance changes that impact the playstyles THEY prefer. Shifting the subcap meta to HACs had a massive impact on subcap fighting, changing and limiting certain compositions in big ways. Just because people can fly the ships doesn't mean it didn't have an impact.
---
Blackout resulted in a massive change to the effectiveness and spread of botting in Eve. No matter how many injectors the botters chug, they won't manage to find an equivalent isk-making method, so they're going to have to downgrade to High-sec or FW and have a much smaller economic impact.
---
Cyno changes have a massive impact. You can't warp a force recon through bubbles, you can't get it through gates that are camped, you can't use it as a throwaway cyno because it costs 400m. Cynoing around is now an activity that needs to be more careful, AND is necessarily more expensive no matter how many injectors you plex.
---
I guess we'll see in the next update it might have this provision, I can't wait!
---
must be european
---
hahahah :) that's actually funny
---
To say no one enjoys pve is just nuts. There are plenty of people who only want to do industry stuff. Or run missions/mine  in hisec.. the game is a sandbox and there is nothing wrong with people wanting to play differently then you.
---
They can’t be seen in d-scab if isn’t on their overview!
---
actually these numbers are at a 5 year low.  A bigger drop off than previous summers.     Also it is being artificially propped up by the log in for skill points thing potentially
---
Massive Multiplayer? In my Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game?
---
It's more likely than you think!
---
As predicted the second they got collared by their asian doms.
---
&gt;If you think this nerf isn't already sweeping youre fooling urself. 
---
I think you need to consider that it might be the purpose. The game is currently broken, even if those who abuse cynos dont think so.
---
&gt;The only thing they could do is add a spool up time for cynos. Anything more completely invalidates using/owning/building any capital ships at all.
---
They had many alternatives, but went with this one. Whatever they chose would have resulted in roughly the same thing - a massive reduction of teleporting caps. You will not escape that reduction by arguing for other nerfs because the goal is unchanged.
---
&gt;And im advocating for it because having multiple options on how you use your cynos is a good thing. 
---
Disagree, and CCP apparently does as well. One of the problems is oppressiveness. The more ships that can fit a cyno, the more oppressive it gets.
---
&gt;BLOPS bs are irrelevant no one will every use them, so theres effectively only 4 ships that can light cynos. Im of the opinion that this is far too restrictive.
---
Even if you consider that the goal is to impose such restriction?
---
&gt;Maybe you deserve to lose sometimes? If you wanna talk hypothetical engagements i can go all day, the fact of the matter is that saying t3c cynos are bad because they could be bait is a bad arguement.
---
You already did: 
---
&gt;Have better intel and better intuition; understand your enemy.
---
By that logic, nothing can ever be broken because its always "your" fault and you should just be better.
---
If the goal is to get rid of the oppressiveness of cynos, you want as few ships as possible to be able to use them. A t3c is much more of a "combat" ship than a recon. If it can fit a cyno, it gets an instant bailout. This should not be in the game because it is oppressive.
---
Yup, and in sharpshooter it gets bonus to sensor strength, worth looking into that.
---
Make Eve a text based game.  Love it!   And when you choose your language, it auto switches (you pick English, it changes  it to Japanese for example) leaving you to figure out what to do.   That would be some chaos alright.
---
I'm sorry you can't read
---
I'm just sitting here wishing JF would stop being caught in attempts to curb capital movement. Hoping they implement something like a JF-only cyno to leave us out of this mess.
---
I don't think your proposals are good, but a territorial shakeup would be wonderful. 
---
In my opinion this should be the way to go:
---
1- Remove at least two of the most remote NS regions entirely (give time to people to evac of course), if one day we have enough players in the game that make more space a necessity we can always reconect them.
---
2- Put an NPC constelation on each NS region.
---
3- Remove gate guns from lowsec (maybe station ones aswell, idk).
---
4- Downgrade the sec status of some HS constellations so that each Empire is separated from the rest by a few lowsec systems.
---
5- (?)
---
6- Profit (?).
---
Its the cumulative effects that will get ya.
---
&gt;I to think it's BS the way CCP does game design to force you into having to use more than one account.
---
Except it doesn't. It forces you to work together with other people. Using multiple accounts is just a way to do the things that are balanced around multiple people doing them without working with other people. It's eminently possible to do everything that "requires multiple accounts" without multiple accounts, just by calling up a friend.
---
Escalations aren't probeable friendo
---
True and this is something that CCP needs to work on. The default overview is utter trash.
---
Any of the FRs would do, wouldn't they? Don't really need 40+km webs for this.
---
Contract me your stuff before you leave.
---
*laughs in forgetting to upgrade your clone back in the day*
---
If they pace it right, it might not actually be a bad idea.
---
Experiment with different changes, see how it plays out - eventually something'll stick.
---
Many people aren't willing to shell out cash for this shitty game. If they are too afraid to take their  carriers out they will unsub
---
Don’t threaten me with a good time
---
Most people I've talked to think that the T3C SP cost is kind of dumb, considering in many cases the ships aren't that much better than other T2 alternatives and tend to require a decent bit of bling to function. 
---
All you're doing here is adding an additional ISK cost to losing a capital ship. If you want to do that, just increase the cost of producing the ship itself, further reduce the insurance payout, and increase the cost of capital modules. 
---
Instead, all you're doing is making ever training Dreadnought level 5 an idiotic and pointless time endeavor, since that vast majority of dreads both don't intend to make it back alive, and aren't really designed to do so.
---
counterargument: small groups unable to field these losses **should** have only limited use of cap ships (they can be used defensively without a cyno etc) **but** there should be more ways for subcaps to deal with caps (maybe a new, specific T2 ship class that does fat damage, but only to the massive sig radii that caps have).
---
Good idea friend let's encourage more people to leave
---
lighting a cyno != oppressive gameplay. 
---
and im fully aware that this is what ccp intends. how many times has ccp done things they fully intended that turned out to be horrible? just because someone at CCP decides something should be done doesnt make it instantly the right decision.
---
I agree with all your points, I have maybe 5 friends who just started the game that I've been able to see first hand how much it sucks for a noob.
---
But it also sounds like the real reason you stuck around was joining a Corp right away that you could grow with. 3rd times the charm, I guess.
---
Only thing HICs needed was a new script to shut down cynos light by tackled capitals, which next month won't be an issue anymore.
---
They are already great, stop bullying my Broadsword.
---
than put the value in the cap but not its means of movement
---
Is it? Everything also would work if you used real players instead of multiboxed accounts.  
---
Want a cyno? Ask a friend to light one. Want to hunt someone? Do it with friends instead of with your army of alts.  
---
Want intel? Have corp members stand watch, alternate who does it.  
---
Want ore? Have people mine with you, instead of logging your swarm of barges and/or rorqs.  
---
Everything in this game would work without alts, it would just require more effort and people willing to delegate, and help.  
---
Personally, i have never really multiboxed, because why bother. Sure, i could have profited from it, even tho i dont use caps, by multiboxing vni (pre-nerf), mining boats or whatever, but i had as much fun as everyone else without multiboxing.  
---
Certainly, the game would be harder but imho also healthier, and probably more social when people cant just throw X alts at everything.
---
&gt; It has nothing to do with how skilled attackers are. This is entirely about being sick of the slowest ships in the game being the fastest and simplest fast-response ship.
---
I wanted to stop reading here because this makes my head hurt. Why does it matter what a capital ships hull speed is? Should wormholes only allow ships that can align under 5s? What other nonsense do you want to tie to unrelated and meaningless measures?
---
You want to be able to attack without having to worry about a response that you would have to work to beat or avoid. That’s all there is to it.
---
&gt; Caps should not be able to provide an instant umbrella at all times without risk. Don’t make that BS organization argument about competent players, because there’s no realistic reason you should even lose caps under your umbrella if you have a couple semi afk fax pilots around.
---
“Don’t say it’s organization when it’s organization”
---
Ok?
---
&gt; Now, I’m not arguing for them to be nerfed directly. Hell, I actually think it’d be cool if supers got buffed and titans got more direct dps such as point defense weaponry.
---
Sure. I think those are terrible ideas with even less thought out consequences but given that this cyno dumpsterfire of an idea will be a mild inconvenience for umbrellas I’m happy to get buffs in return.
---
&gt; What I was suggesting originally was that it should be possible to counter a cyno and make the defender RESPOND to the grid first. Instead of simply uncloaking a corvette, or a recon (with upcoming change) I would rather you have to undock in the Local DEFENDER system, or cyno/gate to that system remotely in some way.
---
So now attacker’s would have to bubble a gate or two and response fleets have to warp in outside of FAX range making the whaling fleet much more likely to get kills before a response can arrive.
---
That smells like just wanting an easier way of getting kills, which just makes EVE safer overall by removing risk from whaling fleets.
---
&gt; The goal of the above is NOT to get “Muh easy nano kills”. What I would like to see from such a change is more subcaps be forced to undock and either warp in and protect the cyno ship somehow, or kill the inhibitor etc. Assuming you achieve your defense goals of getting the cyno online then you can drop your titans on the attacking fleet.
---
Then make all caps/supercaps have dramatically more HP to give time for these supposed subcap fights to play out. Otherwise the result is just people getting “much easy nano kills” and subcaps continue to form exactly as often as they currently do.
---
&gt; Meanwhile, the attacker is likely going to be more happy about the opportunity to hold the grid and fight off/kill the incoming defender subcaps. Instead of “easy kills” I was trying to come up with an idea to actually create more conflict and tactical options towards controlling a grid to have cap superiority. OR just go the lazy route and allow the old cyno mechanics but the incoming cyno ship lands nearby, off grid. Allowing bubble trap counterplay. If your 10 Nyx, Erebus, or Naglfars etc warp in and land in a bubble 200km off you will have to fight/reward from there, OR establish grid dominance (killing bubbles or bubblers) BEFORE warping the caps in.
---
Why does everyone keep suggesting ideas like “you can cyno to the system off grid”? Allow all jump drives to jump to stars then, and make it so that the jump-to point on stars can’t be warped to directly.
---
That combined with the upcoming cyno changes might mean we have more content. Bonus points if you can always jump to the star even under a jammer.
---
Of course that doesn’t give you your “trap counterplay” but it does slow down response times. Of course said trap counterplay isn’t actually counterplay and is instead just a way of delaying/preventing responses so you get easier kills.
---
There’s still zero reason to use subs though. Subs can’t reasonably fight Stuka fleets, or any comp with booshers, because it’s too easy for the booshing fleet to maintain mobility. Instead the goal is to drive the fleet off so that you can secure and establish a perimeter to rescue to non-consenting PvPer. Attackers currently have to work to do this and I could see reasonable changes to things like inhibs working differently but instead what we’re getting is a tax on capital usage and a damp towel on fights as escalating or counter dropping is made much harder.
---
The whole concept is so that it costs something to have a cyno and to invest caps. It also makes it harder to get a cyno into place. You either have to invest an expensive BS or hope your recon can get in.
---
That's a fair point, but csm already confirmed that they had not been told about the drifters or blackout
---
The rest of us put in the time and we came out ok. It's like this: Remember how much you liked Eve when you first found your groove? You were limited in what you could fly, but I you were having fun, right? By encouraging new players to dump IRL cash in a mostly vain attempt to catch up, it feels like CCP is taking advantage of that enthusiasm to make a few more euros. It also discourages CCP from giving frigates, cruisers, etc a solid way to earn earn money and contribute to the success of their organization.
---
&gt;m up to 422k ehp with t3c links (higher with titan phenom or cmd ship links and even more so with the release of shield salves). Sig of 245 meaning it will take a Sebo'd titan (assuming it locks the INSTANT it decloaks and the titan has long range ammo loaded and is ready to cycle which is not realistic if the titans are actively shooting things) over 6 seconds to lock. 6 seconds in tidi while the cyno is active, and if your capital staging system isnt in tidi itself is enough time to get the bulk of your fleet onto grid with extra backup cynos for the rest.
---
It doesn't work now, and I have no reason to believe it will magically start working in September.  In fact, I think it's much more likely that no one tries because the consequences of splitting your fleet up, or worse yet, ending up with a bunch of them at the sun, don't really justify the risk. 
---
&gt; edit: and clearly these fights will ~~obviously change~~ go away until until CCP comes up with a more reasonable iteration.
---
FIFY
---
I propose, you fuck off and deal with it. Why does no one understand these "Heres MY idea CCP!" threads are stupid, and no one gives a shit?
---
They will never nerf injectors, they would have to HATE money to do so.
---
ADAPT AND DIE KRAB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
I upvoted you because you asked to be downvoted
---
&gt;Anyone who has played this game since its inception will remember times when significant game changes were made and the affect it had on them and their playstyle.
---
Battlecruiser V: 2 days, 18 hours, 45 minutes.
---
Battlecruiser Skill Update: 2 days, 18 hours, 14 minutes.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
---
&gt;Reading the main thread shows so many players state they will unsub 40 accounts and quit
---
Well, that's one way to deal with inflation.
---
&gt;Skill a frigate or a cruiser. Dock up that capital and head out into the deep unknown. You'll get more out of this game then you think. Embrace the change, don't fight it... you will lose.
---
BUT EFFORT.
---
Yeah, with the recent hullabaloo about 'leaks' I can see why they would want to keep some of these things quiet. 
---
Biggest shake-ups ever, a heads-up on just one of the big changes could cause some serious problems.
---
Lol I already do enjoy it! And to me exploration is just exhilarating as hell! I've already lost a lot of ships in null/wh. But I've also made a lot of money. Enough to where I can comfortably afford Astero(s). The thrill of finding a plot with a shit ton of cans and finding like 30 times what my ship is worth and hauling ass out of there as fast as I can it's just a big thrill. Never knowing what or who is watching. It's super awesome!
---
Deteroid
---
What do you mean? CCP definitely cares. Where do you think these changes come from? Well right here on reddit is where they are born the last years
---
You've been pouring your angry salt on this sub for days. Just STFU.
---
Good to see StainedGui back to his badposting ways.
---
capitals no longer wind up at sun. they will always jump to the location the cyno was lit, or wont jump in at all.
---
sub caps will jump to a different cyno outside of titan range, or much more likely will already be on grid.
---
I don’t care that you don’t give a shit, the point of the post is to make CCP aware of my thoughts on the new cyno changes. If you have a criticism about the actual idea then I would love to hear that.
---
No salt here spodbrain, just love for our Lord and Savior Hilmar
---
They did delete local........
---
I don't mine or krab, twatbrain.
---
Actually wormholes are supposed to be the most dangerous uninhabitable parts of new Eden, not Nullsec. Time to make them become the most dangerous again.
---
Wait what? Cap blob needs to bring more cap blob to blob more?
---
actually you are saying that.   
---
you just said a guy who logs in and use multiple rorqs for a few hours is not a casual player.    
---
how do you know they have stockpiled isk.  Your assuming they never have to replace there rorq don't go out pvping and lose ships and a whole other bunch of assumptions.     
---
For example rorqs make 100 mill or less an hour.   Three rorqs mine 300 mil.    You go roaming that is gone just as fast as you make it.    That does not include the cost for people who plex their accounts.
---
Eh I disagree with this.  The character bazaar would always fill up with fotm characters after a bit of a delay for training time.   These characters cost way more per sp since they were on demand, and since you had to buy the character in 1 swoop, priced out most new players. 
---
Yes, there was more latency since sales alts had to train there, but with how broken multiboxxed rorqs are and how obvious the bloc meta has been mass titans,  there'd be plenty of supply still.
---
Injectors make the availability more responsive, but also far more accessible, since you only have to pay for missing SP, as opposed to the whole toon.  It really does shrink the gap where new players had literally no options to match new metas, and as a result tended to get farmed by those who could. 
---
Ultimately the capital proliferation issue is related to game age.  Assets are built faster than they are destroyed and accumulated player SP is constantly going up without commensurate increase in player population.  Apply this for over a decade and eventually almost everyone is going to reach the "endgame".  This is where most MMOs release an expansion that renders previous progress obsolete, but that's a tough sell for eve.
---
Lowsec is under used because of you as a small group uses it you get 10 titans dropped on your head everytime it pokes out of the high sec gate a bit.
---
Surely the creation of the triglavian ships falls into this category.
---
Just like moon mining in wh or adc on the retribution.
---
I think youre right to say theyve been on the wrong end of the updates often. Not always.
---
That's the point. They *want* the players to sell their PLEX, so they are nerfing income generation to the point shelling out the real money for the fake money starts to look enticing.
---
My .02 ISK
---
Big winners of this change: Lowsec Residents that love swaggering with their Capitals
---
Mainly untouched: Nullsec Powerhouses
---
Fucked over: Roaming people, small Nullsec entities
---
Capital Escalations: GET FUCKED, whoever has his capitals on grid first and ideally a Muninn Fleet on grid aswell is winning this. Best you can do as a Cyno is a roughly 400k EHP Redeemer, and that is with Slaves and on heat... And it really, really needs a FAX to land reeeeal quick.
---
Roaming: You better show off that you have a Force Recon with you, to create the threat of a Cyno. If you don't have one, you WILL get hotdropped.
---
\---
---
BUY MUNINNS
---
BUY PILGRIMS
---
A dread is a capital? I've been reading reddit and started to believe that only ratting supers and rorquals are capitals.
---
I understand that, but, like I said in the post if you go with a cov ops frig then it is possible to alpha it before a ship can even get through. The point of expanding it is to offer more options, mainly for logistical purposes. In any real fight you are going to want to use a force recon that can actually tank a fleet until logi or a fax can get in.
---
Ehh when I was doing the SoE story arc I had to do some missions in invaded space and was never bothered. I dont think the triglavians warp to you unlike the drifters.
---
Maybe if your idea wasn't a whiney parroting of every other complaint people would care. CCP had the opportunity to choose ANY hulls to light cynos, and decided to make it recons and Black ops. It wasn't becomes of some mechanical-lore interface problem that they couldn't think of a work around for, they meme'd JFs to coverts. Your "idea" is completely contrary to their direction
---
That's fair, I think it's too late to completely remove them. It's more wishful thinking than actual solution. If they never were introduced, the game would be in a much better place in terms of gameplay (game might've been dead because of financial troubles, so who knows, maybe it was the only way to keep Eve going).
---
If they limited them to subcap, it would probably be balanced enough, but it'll suck for new players trying to inject into caps. Either way, it's a very complicated issue.
---
You must not cyno stuff in a lot. Cause it’s very easy to get stuff through even if the cyno is blapped.
---
You’re stupid if you think that, you should cherry pick cans and then quickly fail shit ones twice so the site respawns
---
I disagree. If I came to Eve expecting high APM fast combat then I would be very disappointed. The news articles about the big null fights make it sound very exciting, when in actuality it is a coma inducing lag fest. When people see that lots are turned off if they were expecting exciting gameplay.
---
If I had seen this idea on here already, the I wouldn’t have posted. I understand that CCP chose these hulls, I just think that their choice is too restrictive.
---
If you were around back then you might also remember how many people quit the game and haven't come back.
---
I remember it. Was like the exodus within weeks.
---
I just downvoted you on principal. Stop trying to shove his c*** down your throat for extra points.
---
Insert Jurassic Park "See nobody cares" meme
---
Ah, that could be. I don't remember the mechanics for either very well.
---
CODE use Catalysts very effectively.
---
You mean in response to a higher demand for BLOPs, people are going to farm the materials for them less?
---
we are the goons. you will be assimilated. resistance is futile.
---
yeah, I forgot about that.
---
IT WORKED WITH TITANS RIGHT
---
Sure, maybe 1 or 2 ships, but since caps can no longer light cynos you will have to just bring in another cov ops frig or force recon
---
... wait so... no bait capital..
---
No free frig cyno...
---
No instant protection....
---
..... people are going to pitch a fking fit...  It is the nerf that was needed...
---
And space aids still exists..
---
Yaaaay!!!
---
Grumpy cat would be proud.
---
Well that works too! It could be an easy thing for me actually.
---
Recently I found a bunch of ships dirt cheap and bought them up, but dont have a freighter to truck them to jita unless I do it one by one on my Iteron V.
---
So one thing I could (but wont because frankly I should get more money before I do a loan, this is an example) would be to get a loan to buy a freighter, or at least a trucker with bigger cargo that can fit the ships, and make my 50% profit per ship, and use that to pay off my loan. (yes, I got them half off, hence why I bought even though i currently cant transport)
---
So actually, your comment just answered my question, because those kind of things are the kind of financial institution i was wondering about.
---
&gt;principals
---
&gt;Reddit
---
These two are mutually exclusive. And how dare you make homophobic comments, reported.
---
Soon that’s all That’s going to be left to fly so I guess we ought to figure out how to rat in bombers.
---
Been mining for a week solid with AFK Orcas, no problems. Hobgoblins take care of them. I come back and salvage the wrecks and make some extra ISK.
---
It would result in lots of salt over being hotdropped by titans, but also much opportu- wait, how do I counterdrop it?
---
Why not: You light a Cyno, EVERYONE can jump to it?
---
Pitt's fleets are some of my favorites.
---
And took a wrecking ball to people's faces that own capitals hehe
---
It's oppressive because you can't fight things with cynos unless you also have cynos and you think your blob is bigger. This gets into "predetermined fight"-territory and deceptive game mechanics in that the "strength" of the ship is completely misleading.
---
If you think something has a cyno, you probably avoid the fight as there is no point in fighting.
---
&gt;and im fully aware that this is what ccp intends. how many times has ccp done things they fully intended that turned out to be horrible?
---
Many times. They are usually shit at making changes. This time is different, however. It doesnt really matter what change they make in this context as long as cynos become rare. What they have proposed will accomplish that, so I have no problem with it.
---
I’ll leave the game deving to the people that have degrees an experience in it. Maybe you should do the same.
---
You can think that a you want, no one cares about that. It's the flood of terrible "stuck in bargaining phase" posts on which OP thinks CCP cares about their "solution" to a "problem"
---
I dont think the average person with 3 Rorq alts is considered casual. Maybe there is a unicorn somewhere in the world but the vast majority dont Rorq mine for an hour.
---
Keep going, I'm close
---
&gt; - I kind of want to sign this "Semper Fi", but as I've never been a marine myself, I have not earned that right.
---
Probably the right choice since we aren't the only ones with Marines and not all mottos are the same. ;)
---

How long do trig invasions last? I need to fly through two invaded systems for SOE, and the last time i barely escaped on structure and was on a much faster ship
---
If you ever trained any capital V skills you will know how stupid your proposal is
---
420 likes.
---
I miss learning skills...... I know they sucked for new players, but they made sense
---
i wish you were right. but you aren't
---
What if I told you you don't have to rely on FCs for content? And that capitals aren't the be all end all only source of said content?
---
Edit: also it takes no more time to move with the September changes incoming. You just have to use different ships.
---
Me, nope. These changes are some of the best things to happen in a long time.
---
And the other side of that coin is that the agressors do not have to hold a field or commit right now either. They can as always fade away and cov-cyno out or leave via their wormhole. Only difference with the change is they get a 300m condolence prize.
---
That last sentence reminded me of the guys complaining their 6 man cruiser gang couldn't kill a carrier after carriers got their rework. Good times
---
Damn, the truth hurts sometimes
---
&gt;I am happy to open your eyes on some mechanics: you can fit more then one scram in ship. Don't tell anyone.
---
Oh shoot, you mean that everybody complaining about Ventures in FW don't know about this? My comment was mostly talking about FW, where even if you have high grade snakes and maximum warp speed, you just can't catch Ventures whatever ship you are using because they warp off before you get on grid.
---
&gt;So, it's no more "good tackle frigate"?
---
What do you mean? A day 1 tackle frigate can make fights happen in small gang even more than they can in fleets. You just need an experienced player to show you how and you're golden.
---
&gt;I'll just not fight with it.
---
If I send a super, my goal is to get you off-grid, not kill you or create a fight. Outside of giant bloc v bloc battles, they're a giant content denier.
---
&gt;You can not fight with 10 ships as efficient as you can with 1-2.
---
That's why I said "ISK is for a lot more than buying and exploding ships". I could hire mercs, I could finance a corp to defend me, etc. ISK exists for more than just buying and flying ships.
---
Well this is a nice change of pace from all those REEEEEE CYNOS REEEEE-posts.
---
Good for you.
---
Bridge an Arazu in as they still let a bomber light covips cynos. Way more work / ISK in ships involved.
---
And if you were to go this far to move cynos in place you need at least 4 accounts subbed (including a single cap toon.) Or have alliance members help out. But what would happen if I left to be more independent?
---
In general it’s a shit idea to restrict it this much imo. Either they just want more active subs = more money or they’re bot interested in people having caps when not in bigger groups with the backbone needed.
---
That is a terrible idea.
---
yes that is why I cut off top system from data, it eliminate big fleet fight
---
You mean like literally every reddit thread that was whiny telling them to delete local because it wasnt fair? You people have 0 self awareness, when it's whining for something you want it's perfectly reasonable and when it's something you don't like it's pathetic and should stop.
---
Use an alt account; even an alpha if you’re willing to gather slightly time-delayed intel.
---
AFK Cloaky camping isn't a problem because an afk person can't drop you or really do anything. If they are dropping you then they are not AFK. Also, the dropped fleet isn't immune to dying, it's definitely possible to kill them.  It's not like afk ratting or mining where you don't even have to be at your computer to get stuff.
---
Paying through ingame cash is a much bigger investment lol.
---
Malpais
---
A giant pile of turd and a smaller pile of turd are both still ultimately piles of turd.
---
Well what they said is chaos, what they did is give pvper easier kills. Actions speak louder than words.
---
I've posted 0 delete local threads so I'm not sure what you're on about.
---
What do *you* mean "you people?"
---
Can you state what the adjustment is you're asking for dude
---
There should also be a delay.  How hundreds of ships and caps can literally jump 5ly in 1 second is wrong.
---
There probably should be a limit of ships/mass that can jump through also..
---
So now the only worthwhile ships are ships thay fly Covert ops, what a great change.
---
Reduces damage dealt by 99%
---
Is this a goon complaining about blobbing? Man, blackout be crazy.
---
Or maybe Anime skins. The anime wars will never be allowed to die. :)
---
New hull : The Hentai. BLOPS that bridges through tentacles instead of bombers.
---
I've noticed no change at all since blackout, im still doing 100++ kills /week 
---
\\o/
---
You must build recons then, or have a bunch to sell
---
Youre acting like people didn't constantly post threads saying delete local. I didn't see you going into those threads telling people to stop whining and ccp doesn't read reddit. Your bias is obvious to anyone who pays attention.
---
Ahhhh lol... does that make me old that I didn't get it?  Crap....I thought 30 was young still 🤣
---
Make cynos bloom sig radius. Having a cyno fit will also lower your max capacitor by 25% (like MWDs)
---
Your mining ledger tells you how things operate in Delve?
---
Shut up Hilmar
---
Ohhhh I checked your post history, it all makes sense now.
---
I was just giving you an example .   So you could do some math and relate to it to what you were saying how long does a casual player play a night 2 o 3 hours.   So they make maybe half a bil a night.  I know I am capable of losing that much in a night of pvp.  But I am terrible at it
---
pussy
---
I just wish people and ccp would stop going to such extremes to change the game. I honestly think little changes would go far instead they are flipping things on their head and players are quiting.
---
Catching caps seems the polar opposite of bringing in capitals.  
---
I think there is room for a couple other ships to be on the cyno list, but I dont think hictors should be on there. They already have several well aligned uses.
---
Banned
---
Been playing from 2008 to 2018. My memory is long :P
---
Well it's a genre difference as well, wow is a fantasy mmorpg and I can't think of any other third person (first person is ass in Eve outside frigate) space mmorpg with ships classes from frigate to capital. The whole game system is based on a ton of things you gotta click on and if you're overview isn't set up right you won't see even half the shit out there like drones. Turn off all brackets and minimize overview and see how that goes.
---
I obviously wasn’t talking about DED ratting.
---
Pretty much yes. There will be swaths of bomber fleets throughout null. How horrendous is that
---
Before long it will cost plex to undock and have fully reached arcade game status
---
Lol, I only know where it at cuz im in Brave
---
looking up north, a lot more than pre-blackout
---
That I mine shining xenotime while you mine spodumain
---
Cloaky defense fleet, with bait rorqs and covert cynos? IDK
---
Let's also also bring back clone upgrades. :)
---
Now that would generate some chaos.
---
Says the guy crying about a video game change he doesn't like
---
Good thing you chose to ignore the other half.
---
This, i feel like they have given roaming groups a huge boost. Which is great, but there is a much larger issue at hand.
---
I love the Corax. It's my favorite hull in eve by far. But it is complete and utter dog shit. The Stork can be a *very* fun lowsec PvP ship, but the Corax unfortunately is just terrible. I'm not entirely sure about what's best vs Trig NPCs, but I thought I'd offer that up.
---
I know this is all sensitive because payment and people’s money is involved, and I’m not belittling that. I’m just trying to have a conversation here. 
---
But, EVE has always been a paid service. As a subscription model, it was pay to play from the beginning. At some point, for CCP to survive, even grow, they need a revenue stream and they need it to grow. They probably want to expand their player base too. 
---
Back when most games as a service/mmo models were subscription based, it was pay to play and play meant you had to grind. In the case of EVE it was quite unique! You had to literally wait for skills to train and could only grind for isk. I’m sure those of us who have been on the block a while would remember the numerous players saying they didn’t want to join for fear of never being able to “catch up”. Subscriptions, thus, were paid time, and time gave you skills/isk. Today, CCP offers a way of paying to avoid that time. Not to win, necessarily, but to skip the subscription time we used to accept as normal to any mmo model. For some of us, we have been able to slowly tick away at skills and have hundreds of millions of skillpoints. I myself have never injected but playing EVE on and off for more than a decade puts me at like nearly 200m SP.
---
I’d venture out and say many players keep playing on because they can skip that grind, and player expectations have shifted over the years. They way we consume games is not static. 
---
I’m not exactly upset that people can close that gap for money. If you took the time I have been subscribed and paid it all at once, what might that cost look like? Should they also have to wait years before they can play all the variety in the current meta? 
---
Besides, it’s giving us more people to shoot in the pvp scene ;D
---
I talk in wormholes to assert my dominance
---
Uhhhh no whs are not worse than NS sorry.. maybe super crabed c5 can put a dent in it. But no bounties are by far the largest contributor to isk printing. The problem is the Ihub in terms of isk faucet. Nothing else compares even remotely I believe I read in a MER break down recently that mentioned out of all the isk generated roughly 65% of it is bounties the other 35 is items sold to NPCs which would include wh stuff.
---
So yes you can make a dumbass amount of isk fairly easily in whs but the ubiquiti of infinite anomalies overshadows them by comparison.
---
Vni has been broken for years idk what finally got them to fix it.. alphas I guess as bad as that sounds.
---
Rorquals are actually fine.. I'm a convert.. I hated them at first but the only big issue I have with them is their compression so they can stay in the belt for forever. There tank was probably to good on release tho lol.
---
I'll admit I miss seagulls vision.. without her ccp feels like they're the blind leading the blind.. they need a better project manager instead of burger.. I don't like him.. 
---
It's hard to quantify the difference from they need more man power to they just haven't fixed it yet.. Eve is the more complex mmo ever made.. they need a team to advise a te to advise another team to maybe make the right change lol.. imo at least they're doing something instead of sitting on there hands making shitting structures.
---
You haven't thought about this at all, have you?
---
It's just change, not chaos.
---
Change is good, chaos is bad.
---
At its core EVE is a risk management game, chaos is only enjoyable if you have so much resources that the losses incurred don't matter to you.
---
I wish I couldn't after reading your comments
---
The fact that vaping exists.
---
"Currently regional powers face little threat from other regional nullsec powers simply due to distance. Possibly make these connections subcaps only."
---
have you seen how few jumps it is between test and goons?
---
Would you rather people smoked, or spit wads of tobacco juice?
---
W H OMEGALUL ?
---
My oh my your roller is so massive
---
There's a finite supply of the materials used introduced every month, and they're already farmed pretty decently.
---
Slippery Pete will be the new rescue meta
---
Haha... down voted for pointing out what the one month post-sov map actually looks like! r/eve I love you. No wonder CCP is listening to you. They too like to stick their heads in the sand.
---
I was mostly talking about the pve side of thing. Think of someone multiboxing Rorqs, multiboxing FOF Ravens in wormholes and such. You can also pvp with 6+ alts in some situations (structure bashes). Only logi pilots have to pay attention during structures bashes.
---
Within 2 years, you can easily get enough skillpoints for T2/3 cruisers. Back in the day, you could also buy dread/carrier alts as well from the character bazaar at roughly the same prices (or slightly more expensive). Nothing you did would be impossible back in the day, without skill injectors. Meanwhile, skill injectors have completely wrecked with the game. Gameplay wise, the game would have been better without them.
---
Only because we cleaned out the sov holders, and you and I both know--it will not last.
---
So you can't actuslly debate the point on hand. You only tell people to stop talking about changes you don't support. You are fine with people posting about things you think are good but want everyone else to shut up.
---
who told you that, Tama gate camps are NPSI no one is blue in the Nourve gate camp, just ask in local for a gate camp invite and they will let you join
---
So there's enough mats, and demand will increase, and you're saying the price will not drop as a result?
---
All of this assumes that isk is an issue.
---
I mean it's pretty dumb for 5 of out of 400 ships to be the only thing worth flying. Ccp could have said no cynos on caps and made it so other ships are worthwhile.
---
&gt; How would you reccomend doing that on a ship with paper thin tank that shows up on everyone's overview in the entire system when cyno is popped?
---
Local superiority. Regular baiting. etc etc.
---
If you can't protect it you don't deserve to keep it.
---
Capitalism at its finest
---
So they will get the timer if they aggress you, they can clear the agro from the station guns by warping away and then back.  They can then aggress you without the station guns shooting.
---
Oh fuck off, you lonely spod brain, nobody likes you or your bullshit moaning, so keep chucking out your sad  projection and we will keep laughing at how pathetic you are, about a computer game.
---
Also, I quit a while back, when twats like you *became* the log in numbers...thus: I would rather have quality, rather than quantity, if quantity means bellends like you. Enjoy losing you fucking pleb.
---
Skill point loss is an awful mechanic, and id love to see it gone from t3Cs too. I dont think punishing people for losing their cap is a solution to anything. Theres plenty of things wrong with capitals, but making it hurt more when you lose one isnt a good fix.
---
Sadly, the Corax is in *desperate* need of a buff. It's one of the best-looking hulls in the game and it has an interesting potential niche as a missile destroyer. It's just terrible in its current state.
---
&gt;  You and CCP have told me "fuck off, you're playing the game wrong". So I am.
---
If you were really fucking off you'd post screenshots of biomassing your alts.
---
You're not doing that though are you.
---
Can't boosh a ship with a cyno up
---
There's nothing to debate? CCP made a change and every moron with a keyboard and a Colossal is coming up with ideas that contradict the entire spirit of the changes. Most of them are completely terrible too.
---
After the whole Brisc thing, I'd be surprised if they didnt let the CSM cool their heels for a bit.
---
Damn, but it looks so cool and fun of a ship. What a shame
---
oh sorry, did i hurt your feelings... please don't cry
---
overall i think many people would love to see terrain tweaks, and the map could use a shakeup. Surely we have discovered some new systems by now yes? Or, now that we literally have jump gate tech we could expand a bit more?  
---
Now, in order to make all that a more effective change though i think we need to make geography and terrain matter a bit more first though.
---
More fun for everyone when the meta is diverse and not just dominated by a couple of ships.
---
You mean like the dozens of small entities that just took space in the north right?
---
This "small guys" getting hurt narrative you all keep trying to push is hilarious.
---
Doesn't stop torps though. That's really the bigger threat.
---
But.. If the FC doesn’t tell me how will I know to align or take a gate? How will I know what’s primary. I need structure. I don’t know how to handle these emotions.
---
THIS, a million times over.
---
And might I complain, the biggest issue I see (aside from having to adapt), are NS' boys complaining that these changes make them less safe.
---
Oh sorry, NS isn't supposed to be safe!  if you want safe ISK printing, go to HS.   
---
And don't forget, more risk = greater rewards.  That's supposed to mean something in Eve. Well done CCP, for trying to re-establish that goal!
---
And will probably remain unchanged if not buffed as CCP continues to bend knee to the common eve pvp player that spends too much time on reddit.
---
I just wanted to add, I will stop complaining if CCP refunds my 35 million or so skill points sunk into capital ships. I believe that this is a large enough change in the core mechanics of the ship classes that this needs to be offered at no cost to the players. I.e. we should not have to pay in either cash/isk for the extractors and skill point loss for re-injection. CCP should literally just refund all the skill points. People interested in staying in their capitals can just re-apply the skill points.
---
Otherwise, my capitals stay docked anyway--sorry I won't be adding any 'content' with them--until they are needed by the alliance, and my alts stay turned off; however, lets face it, those alts were really mostly useful for the cyno alts on the accounts, and I won't be needing those anymore either way.
---
I cannot believe I am saying this, but I am at the point now where I believe Wargaming is more deserving of my money than you are CCP.
---
im aware of how big fights are. ive been in a few myself
---
Well, I hadn't thought that far ahead.... I'll have to ask my FC and report back
---
It does.
---
If you actually knew anything about Eve, you'd know that biomassing is not permanent.
---
What you're asking for has largely already been implemented by wormholes.
---
Shoot em...what is a bomber ehp...2 shots with a dessy? Everyone worries bout bombers. Yet people be dropping titans on frigate gangs.
---
So why the fuck aren't you doing that in the official EVE forum thread? Starting your very own reddit thread certainly has a lower chance of them seeing it.
---
Also they're not going to care, the number of Hulls is *supposed* to be restrictive. Thats the whole fucking idea.
---
No, I think the ozone has gone to your head.  The cost to light a cyno has nothing to do its ease of use.
---
A cyno is easy to multibox, it doesn't have to do anything except light the beacon.  It can be essentially AFK cloaked nearby, stuffed in a nearby hangar, or hiding in a safe spot until you want to light the cyno.  If you're traveling with it, you just need to keep it in the same system as the rest of the fleet, which isn't difficult.
---
When you can fit cynos on corvettes, lighting them risks &lt;1 mil isk.  It might get blown up, but 1 million isk is a deterrent for nobody.  T1 frigates are only marginally more expensive.  The $15 to sub a second account might deter you, but if you already have two subbed accounts you have no reason not to have a cyno alt.  Everyone in a fleet who has more than one omega account can keep a cyno alt nearby with minimal extra effort and almost no additional cost, which makes it difficult to pop them all before the caps arrive.
---
Right now, needing to pay for an extra account hasn't stopped cyno alts from becoming a problem.  They're easy to bring, losing one costs you nothing, and as a result they fit into every fleet no matter how small and capital umbrellas are oppressive.
---
With the change, losing a cyno alt costs 400 million isk instead of 1 million isk.  The cheapest ships you can fit them on are expensive and fragile.  Nothing has fundamentally changed about the player effort required to light a cyno or keep an alt near your fleet, but if you lose your cyno alt you've lost much, much more isk on a ship that was never likely to survive for long under fire.  It's not worth risking your 400m cyno to drop caps on a 50m isk enemy fleet roaming through your umbrella, nor is it worth risking your 400m cyno to drop caps to protect a 50m isk friendly fleet under your umbrella.  Dropping caps on small roaming gangs is a lot less likely to end with your corp being isk positive.
---
Lets say we go with the other plan, and we go hard.  We'll make cyno modules prohibitively pg/cpu intensive, so much so they only fit on battleships.  Right now T1 battleships come in at around 120-150 million isk.  That's significantly more than a frigate, but still fairly low when you start talking about fleets and faction/T2 fits.  On top of that, we get battleship level tank, so it'll be significantly harder to pop the cyno quickly.  There's also almost no extra time investment in preparing a cyno alt, you can sit in a battleship after 4 days of training, and that's with a suboptimal attribute spread.
---
We can address that by adding penalties, but that's a more involved discussion.  We can destroy their tank so they're easier to pop, we can ruin their maneuverability so they take forever to align and warp, or we can do something else.  However, penalties don't address opportunity cost, it's still worthwhile to have one nearby for a lot of small fleet action.  Maybe you don't take a particularly slow cyno battleship with you when you roam, but no matter how slow they are defensive placement remains a matter of planning, and the impression I get is that defensive cap umbrellas are the biggest part of the problem.  Overall, without addressing the risk vs. reward analysis for cynos, you're not going to accomplish anything.  Just changing penalties and fitting requirements isn't going to do that.
---
The change accomplishes two things.  First, it increases the cost required to field a cyno, making cynos harder to justify in some situations.  Second, with fewer ships capable of carrying cynos, it makes it easier to balance and account for their presence on those ships.  If cyno spam continues to be a problem, changes can be concentrated on a few ship classes instead of all of them.
---
Only change I would expect is maybe adding another ship class, personally would like to see electronic attack frigates able to light cyno.
---
??????
---
I guess you've not seen the CSM minutes in the past where they have shot down ideas that are complete dogshit from devs....
---
Why did i quit eve...
---
Epic meme sir
---
So I don't fly anything at all =)
---
So here's what I've gotten from the Cyno stuff so far...
---
- Standard Cyno can only be mounted to a Force Recon or a Black Ops.
---
- Covert Cyno can still be mounted to any form of Covert craft, including CovOps Frigates.
---
So that means you need to sneak a CovOps frig behind enemy lines first. Then use a Black Ops to bridge in a Recon. Then the Recon gets in position and lights up for the rest of the fleet. As the Caps start to move, you bridge in another Recon since you know the first is gonna die.
---
Sure sounds like a lot of fleet involvement, instead of all the solo Cap play we've seen for years. And it sounds like Coverts and especially Black Ops will become more useful.
---
A tad too much negative feedback, mayhap?
---
OOF
---
I saw title, thought "gotta be Daaavid Cee"; surprisingly wasn't.  Well shit drop, none of the ammo dropped.
---
Also, TIL Erebus BPC costs 72b
---
KarmaFleet is recruiting.
---
Rorqual and fax balance passes are the only meaningful changes. 
---
Warp decel and warp speed balance = shit. 
---
Ecm balance = shit. 
---
FB/fighters damage application= shit.  
---
Frigate tracking HAW guns blanace = shit.
---
no one is ever interested in being a target, but it's the very nature of the game that everything should be one
---
No, it isn't. What you want is to be able to kill Rorqs and Supers without the threat of the umbrella. Its the exact opposite of what you want, because I will not be contributing any content to you at all. 
---
That being said, as a goon... I fully expect cyno recons will be added to ship replacement, and even when you do find Rorqs and supers you are still going to get escalated in the face--at least in Delve.
---
This adds one or two steps to lighting a cyno, and allows for more counterplay. No matter your feelings on injectors and alts, the cyno being off the rorq and onto a subcap changes the tactical situation quite a bit.
---
Lmao, good luck finding content anymore since it's already drying up quicker than ever you dumb fuck.
---
Also I don't mine and I haven't ratted in years you cunt, the game would be better off if retards like you would just shut the fuck up and stop posting their dumb cry threads for the past 2 years. Lmfao mate, you dumb faggots have been whining for like 2 years straight, shut the fuck up.
---
Maybe they just want less overall cynos period, so thats why its being so restricted.
---
Another reason why I don't play. Multiboxing is mandatory to do anything and that's gimmicky as fuck, yo.
---
Oh that sucks..
---
Great change CCP
---
true chaos would be allowing everyone only 1 account that would be glorious
---
You don’t. You light a covert cyno which is 30 seconds on a recon and doesn’t show up on off grid overview.
---
CCP: We are taking the cynos away from people because you don't know how to behave.
---
Null sec: Cool so now we get to put that one alt we werent using as a force recon cloaky cyno next to my super.
---
High Sec: NULL SEC IS DYING LONG LIVE HIGH SEC
---
I stopped playing eve when I stopped getting the shakes. Isk cost of a battle doesn't wow me or excite me into resubbing. Alot of my time is taken up by adult responsibilities.
---
The main issue is the veteran/core players who still play have adjusted their lives to fit around the game. The main alliance leaders rely on dwinling content creators and the popular play is ping warrioring to increase numbers.
---
The problem for CCP is they can make all the changes, rock the boat for current players and introduce new difficulties for alliances of all to adapt to. But until they find a way to become attractive to younger players to replace the aging community, then I feel it might be too little too late.
---
Could also bridge through a bunch of recons instead of risking the blops itself.
---
Here we go again.  So what exactly do you know that everyone else does not?  Do you suppose they would make a change knowing it would cause lost revenue?  Therein lies your stupidity, reliance on group think and retarded view of the opinions of others.  Rather than actually state facts (such as the specific things you claim I do not understand) showing that you understand the thing you claim to know, you attack me to redirect the attention of your fellow retards for your bloody karma.  The problem is, as if even a half brained fuckwit like yourself can’t see it, is that you have stated nothing of substance in support of your argument.  You have accused me, and others, of not understanding something and I’m calling you on your bullshit.  Spit it out or stfu.
---
IF ONLY YOU COULD MAKE A FRIEND AND HAVE THEM LIGHT YOUR CYNO THEN YOU'RE NOT PAYING FOR AN EXTRA SUB RIGHT?
---
AND NO ITS NOT BESIDES THE POINT IT IS THE FUCKING POINT YOU FUCKING WOOD CHIP EATING CLOWN.
---
Ughh.. finally .. thank you lol..
---
T1 ships are super fun to fly, though.
---
I fully support the changes CCP has made - the things they've nerfed really needed nerf.
---
But injectors are also ridiculous. I would much prefer them never to have been introduced, or for CCP to remove them now, but I fear they're too much of a cash boost so that won't happen. But they really shouldn't be an instant hit so you can't inject straight into high level ship.
---
Your idea is interesting but I'd just make them work like a +5 accelerator.
---
CCP Coldfeet
---
No, this is just a bad change.  If you don't want combat ratters to have a cynosural generator in the game, you don't flat out forbid it.  Instead, you discourage it.  Eve is supposed to be a game of trade-offs.  Get this, but that happens.  Get this instead, and that happens differently.  A cyno balance in this manner would be changing the module to require a turret or missile hard point instead of just any utility high.  This allows the option at the expense of reducing damage.  Carriers have no turret or missile hard points.  Dreadnoughts would lose a significant amount of damage and it would be obvious when using the look-at mechanic.  Titans, that's questionable in the context of this intention but it has always been agreed upon that locking a titan in place for 10 minutes is worth it.
---
You're saying that this is going to bring new gameplay, but you don't mention at all that it completely annihilates others.  Faux-miners fit cynos and bait things that bite.  Wormholers still have to move their capitals about.  Low-sec mini-powers use cynos for escalation against anything that decides to brawl with them.  None of that was "wrong" in Eve and it's going away because of a bad change.
---
Also, as others have suggested CCP should remove ships from the game. That way nobody will be sad when they get escalated trying to gank ships in sov space where people are actually organized enough to fight back with overwhelming force. 
---
Instead of ships CCP can re-institute Incarna and make our ships just models we can look at on a desk.
---
You can't PvP without grinding for money lol
---
Unless you're a target for a super umbrella.  Apparently, that should not be allowed.
---
having a hard limit on the number of structures in system (1 tower per moon, 1 station per system) made nullsec work
---
Make sure you load opposite ammo for whatever mission rats he's fighting (If your weapons allow that). They rarely fit for all damage resistance, so he'll probably have a gaping hole to exploit.
---
YEA GRATH IF YOU KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT EVE....are you smoking crack for your afternoon tea?
---
It gets slightly more tedious, but ideally, you'll never lose a cyno ship again. Your recon is basically vulnerable for 30 seconds. Anything that needs to warp is already going to be too late.
---
i think \`perhaps the story of how the game thinks the Erebus bpc is worth 72 bil may be more of a mystery
---
The very reason why PLEX is cheaper is less people in general. That means less competition thereby higher prices. You will see them going up soon.
---
Pretty much only one type uses PLEX.
---
No dude. Botting is not PLEX related.
---
It is SP related.
---
I guess yeah, one's as good as another in that respect.
---
I think Rapiers are a little faster and more agile though, makes them a touch easier to get in place.
---
Get better at pvp? ;)
---
Idk maybe changing Marauders to have cap guns and give them dread siege module.
---
It bad
---
I'm not the one who thinks something reversed with a petition (that are treated as very-high-priority so it actually gets a timely response) is some sort of big deal.
---
So, enjoy your crack.  But it doesn't change you're wrong about the effect of biomassing.
---
I will no longer be flying my supers or capitals in anything but fleet ops, therefore they will only ever have a complete fleet doctrine fit, which do not have cynos fit in the first place.
---
You know he invented the bombing of bomber fleets right?
---
Skill injectors were introduced two years before pearl abyss bought ccp? I think you're confused, the prediction was ccp would start selling cat ear cosmetics, loot boxes and premium items without in game means to obtain.
---
I can get behind that I just think it's way overboard.
---
Just add npc space and stations to every region. Now shit gets dangerous. Further more, make them within jump range of each other after taking a regional gate. Watch the chaos spread
---
Classic TAPI FCs, trying to get other people to tell them how to actually play. Don't you guys just have a discord you can ask Goon FCs in?
---
There is no "real money" or "fake money", only units of time. If an hour of work is 20 hours of grinding, is another currency fake? Absolutely not!
---
they could have made small gradual changes but instead we get CHAOS.
---
Oh so you know what the spirit of the change was and have seen ccps grand plan with this? No I didn't think so.
---
Everyone is making suggestions because we have 0 idea what CCP is trying to do and feel what they did has gone to far.
---
Keep the salt flowing.
---
" If you really don't feel like this game is for you then stop posting about it and just move on. "  
---
How about you fuck off and stop trying to live in a black and white universe. It is possible to enjoy something and hate it at the same time. Sorry that doesnt fit into your narrow world view.  But any way, please go on trying to justify this era of hype inducing changes made by ccp under strict obligations from Pearl Abyss as if there is any greater wisdom to just taking it in the teeth again and again and again.
---
You're never "sure" if ratting is safe though.
---
oh yea... true that
---
You can read some online like this one: https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-02-23-mine-asteroids-build-space-stations-this-is-the-purpose-of-life —- you will notice skill trading was Hilmars first positive highlight in terms of revenue growth
---
Regardless of being able to do ice or not, Venture bots are a real thing because they can still make money for 0 cost.
---
Belts are full of orcas, and those orcas are almost all players watching Netflix or managing barges. There is nothing amiss with this bottingwise.
---
Yes, L4 mission bots were a thing. The major issue wasnt security although that was botted too; it was distribution. You clearly haven't been around those spaces much or paid attention to the T1 indy traffic. It's okay to admit you don't know rather than move the goalposts and act knowledgeable about it.
---
Dude, the numbers are super high. Its like 30% from WHs whilst maybe 40-50ish from NS. Considering the amount of people that live in NS in comparison it makes WH faucet/capita extremely high. Thats the sold items, the blue loot faucet. 
---
Yes but lots lots more share those. Considering NS has maybe 40% of the games pop in comparison to maybe 5% in WHs you have to see how that makes WH blue loot faucet extremely supercharged and that should be nerfed way before NS honestly. 
---
Right now theyre pretty good. But they used to be 400m/hour. Not for long tho. 
---
I agree.
---
Ye I guess. But I would much rather they did long term stuff.
---
ok, there was a text, I'm obviously bad at reddit, here it is : 
---
Right now in Tama, standard mining op with rorquals, excavators and carrier support.
---
Let's have a thought for those not affected (yet) by this chaos era :d 
---
ps: J104517 and J134349 both have a large connection to Tama. have fun
---
An important point left out was that at any time the shield could be repped by defenders.
---
Good.
---
Have you looked at recons sensor strength? By the time you are likely to get a jam, the cavalry will have locked the empty carrier too...
---
That's complete and utter bullshit. The point of the douchebags using cargo scanners is to cherry pick and move on. No one spends time blowing them up.
---
At least try to make your douchebaggery sound legitimate.
---
Good to hear :) His stuff was always spot on.
---
It is too narrow and allows for too much tz tanking just like citadel exit timers is my only issue with it anymore. Should be even at max utilization a double or triple the sized window, with adm 1.0 being 24 hour vulnerability. Tz tanking ruins the war aspect of the game for me
---
Maybe add it to the monitor?
---
It's not going to change my revenue at all. I make almost all of my isk through trading. I still think the changes are stupid, not well thought out, and represent the worst of MMO development I have ever seen--and I used to work on MMOs for a living.
---
Furthermore, I think the nature of 'real time training' combined with what amounts to a *significant* change to the core game mechanics of all capital ships, that CCP ought to refund all capital related skill points people currently have. If the players want to continue flying the capitals, that's fine, they can just put the skill points right back; however, people should be offered as, taking me as an example, the skill points I have sunk into capital ships represents almost two years of real time training, and I would not have trained them at all if these were the cyno mechanics when I started training into capital ships.
---
Not downvoting this post. I hope it gets it to the top so everyone can pile on. :)
---
OP, Stop griping. None of my current cyno pilots can fly recons and I've got several caps that will rely on someone else if they are needed. I may not fly them for a while but there are plenty of OTHER hulls that are good to fly. Try getting out of the barge and shooting some random dude in your T1 cruisers. It's a lot more fun than you probably think, especially when you win by a hair.
---
I'm not the one crying about quitting without offering any real evidence of doing so v0v regardless of the ability to reverse it, people who really quit eve delete their alts.
---
You're just being  a pussy
---
Not worth the time sink tbh. Give me arenas where I can reliably find 1v1s and maybe it'll come back. But it's not worth dying to camps or gangs just to have to mine or explore or whatever.
---
.... Injectors were a thing we'll before pearl abyss acquisition. *What* was bound to happen sooner or later.
---
Also since when did idiots start saying injectors were pay to win again LOL so retarded wrong.
---
Injectors are a problem but wtf is this nonsense, talking about it like it's a golden gun.
---
Before i call bullshit because I'm pretty sure this is bullshit, explain how you mine and kill rats while afk in an orca.
---
\~\~\~mine for funds\~\~\~
---
I'm honestly just waiting for the dust to settle. My immediate thoughts on the change is that I don't like it, purely out of selfish reasons like having to train alts into more expensive ships. All just to do something simple like move a carrier. I am not thrilled that if I want to move solo through lowsec I am going to have to put a potential of billions on the table just to move a ship thats not even worth that much. But this is life and if thats what it is so be it. Everyone that keeps playing will adjust, there isn't an alternative unless you just go play something else. 
---
Outside of that, I do see the value added by making a cyno only usable on a ship that is vulnerable. It gives the chance for some counter play instead of the current meta of just drop fax, light cyno, win fight. 
---
I would like to see a T1 ship of some sort being able to light a cyno in the future though. Or maybe and adjustment to the duration of cynos. 1/6th of an hour is such a long time.
---
I, honestly, keep forgetting about wormhole space. Its way cooler and more fun than any other space.
---
Catching one at a gate or leaving station is likely the best bet. 
---
If you try to get them in a site, you have a whole fleet and the rats to deal with. Also if they're not alone, you'll have to be sure to kill them with the first volley or a Nestor/logi/other leshaks can rep them, meaning a kill isn't guaranteed before concord drop by.
---
It can definitely be done, but it'd need a good deal of planning, and would be expensive to fuck up.
---
From what I know, CCP’s quarterly earnings did not meet the expectations of Pearl Abyss. Hence the seemingly unexplainable meta changes, module nerfs, overpowered aliens in weird bathrobes, etc.. including anti-botter efforts. Whoever is the alien brain behind the scenes is desperately trying to re-balance the game to make more money per the demands of Pearl Abyss, or *SHOCKER*... CCP may go down. Then no one will play EVE and all we’ll have is arguments about who was the most “elite” before the game died. 
---
So y’all just STFU and stop complaining about “but but muh TITAN bruh” and if you’re gonna unsub then do it and go away. No one cares.
---
This doesn't have too much effect on moving assets for strategic sized battles - what is the cost of a recon compared to a capital fleet?
---
It does stop escalating each and every fight to capitals without thinking about it, but that's good.
---
Well - think the problem in many people's eye's is that caps can be used largely with impunity.  If your 120 million SP toon is going to lose JDC V if they die - they may decide not to drop their Avatar on that imicus.
---
Ask them in local for a 1V1. in cheap hulls. I bet you get takers all day. They might even let you mine for a bit having had their fill of you.
---
unsubbed the week after they announced sale to Pearl Abyss. still unsubbed. often come to reddit to be validated over decision, again and again. it's like some of you have the memory of a gold fish around here.... do you not remember CCP selling their IP last year?  You really think Hilmar and his dev team just now suddenly decided to do the best work of their eve career shortly before they leave the payroll? Get real.  See you in Canada when you finally get a clue.
---
the battle of x47 where both sides were shooting fax and no titans died, apparently
---
unidentified wh
---
Tbh all these things needed nerfing but skill injectors need a rework yee
---
&gt; I just wanted to add, I will stop complaining if CCP refunds my 35 million or so skill points sunk into capital ships.
---
Why should they do that? You can still fly the ship exactly the same as before. Should they have refunded all ship skill points when they introduced HICs because now it wasn't so easy to move them around?
---
Refunding skill points put into the cyno skill would arguably be fair enough.
---
Yea it was all goons, totally had nothing to do with pamfam choosing to cede the territory and not retake it when the blackout was announced.
---
Can I get a tldr?
---
I hear tell he also coded them into the game.
---
The evaluation is subjective my dude, there’s not an issue with what the labels means, there’s a question about your criteria for applying them...
---
Null sec is not currently safe, except where emergent game play through human interaction has made it safe. What you are essentially saying is that organic institutions, which this game was originally developed around fostering, are not supposed to make people safer. 
---
You might as well complain about the police and social safety nets in the real world, "life isn't supposed to be safe!1!! I should be allowed to take your shit easily, and you being a social animal that builds institutions that serve to protect you isn't fair!" 
---
PS. For large alliances who can literally just *hand people new recons when they die* nothing changes. Null sec is still safer for them because it turns out it is *really hard* to nerf basic human interaction.
---
&gt;both don't intend to make it back alive, and aren't really designed to do so.
---
Maybe they should be then 🤔
---
The volume hasnt gone down significantly, so that is unlikely. The major change lately is the black out. So that is the correct answer. There is just a lot less isk coming into the game. Maybe the plex sale helped a bit.
---
Unlikely to be SP related.
---
Not on Reddit ;D
---
I really think that’s what they’re trying to do. But as you said, it might be a case of too little too late. The guys that started playing EVE in 2003 were basically just kids then. This kind of game was literally one of a kind. Now we’re all a lot older, got kids, exes, back problems, and ultra-graphics games are all over the place. I fear that CCP is vying for a new player base that’s at best, wearily familiar with wiz-bang computer games.
---
Weren't a couple of our recruits basically press ganged into corp?
---
Not what I mean. The entosis ships are beside the point. These attacks are usually contested and often in ad hoc fleets that will engage you. Who cares if the toasters live or die. :)
---
Dreads cost less than Marauders (post-insurance)
---
tldr urgaypwnd
---
CCP got what they wanted out of it. A bunch of people with either spend money for a cyno recon alt or they will be like me and pretty much quit ratting and just buy plex to fund their stuff. I've been caught carrier ratting before. Im sure that was a fun kill for those involved. But no more because I'm just not going to rat. Enjoy the 0 kills on me because yall just lost a target
---
There are plenty of places to fight and be had. if you are going out to null and expect a fair fight or a gud fight thats not how eve works. you can't force people to fight you fairly. someone will always have more ships more accounts and more isk to throwaway. I am not a fan of capitals but the blackout did nothing to change how risk adverse both pvp and pve players are. you don't see pvp roaming nullsec with brawling battleships because they are going to get dunked. You see them in nano fit agile gang fights so they can pick and choose fights and disengage when overwhelmed. Don't get me started with booshers bombers and cloaks. The only people wanting real fights are the null sec blobs who are willing to bear all they have to take and protect space that they rightfully captured and built.
---
tl;dr some bullshit
---
I agree, CCP hasn't stated what their actual goal was. I think we can all agree that it would be silly for a company to do such a thing outside of what was released. Let's take a look at what they said:
---
&gt;This change will make it more complex and demanding to get capitals to the field quickly and give more strategic options for those wishing to disrupt capital response.
---
How did they choose to make it more complex and demanding? By using T2 cruisers and T2 battleships as the only hulls that can light a cyno. These hulls fairly expensive, costing 200m+, before market manipulation and announcement, or over 1b. They are also much slower than something like a cyno ceptor or sabre. They require a dedicated ship to be used instead of being able to "defensively" fit a cyno to any hull.
---
I'd argue that adding significant cost and SP investment to be able to cyno made it more "demanding" and the inability to move them extremely fast made it more "complex." Allowing covops cyno capable ships (covops, bombers included) takes away from both the investment in SP (I think Cyno V and Frigate V are a shorter train than recons/blops, but feel free to verify). That's why this post is against the "spirit of the changes" in my opinion, and also bad. 
---
Please don't make me effort post anymore :(
---
&gt;As a hunter do you ever potentially sit 24 minutes without touching anything?

Are you stupid or retarded
---
Yea I don't mean the toaster. I mean the shit is cancer at generating fights from most the stuff iv been involved in. Guess the goon war machine is too strong though
---
How do you feel about the changes? Thought for sure you’d be eating some French cries.
---
In order to fully embrace Hilmar's vision of a chaotic experience, and to finish the destruction of any investments of time that players have made, Eve should remove all graphics and switch to a fully ascii mode display.
---
Then, it would literally be playable on anything. Computer, browser, tablet, even smartwatches.  In fact, those new refrigerators with built-in displays might soon be playing the new Eve of Chaos!
---
You never really quit EVE untill you toss all your shit and biomass. You'll be back.
---
Ouch
---
cyno change isnt any skin off of my nose, just pay2win i guess
---
or UALX
---
What kind of monitor do you have if you don't mind me asking?
---
Would like to see in delve or querious, ptreey sure there will be -20% drop
---
This beautiful example of \~elite pvp\~ echo chambering is exactly why CCP needs to stop listening to these dumbasses: this guy clearly, as illustrated by the incredibly amount of inaccuracies in his post, has no experience with nullsec warfare or capital battles - yet he believes he can offer an informed opinion.
---
just rolled them with dreads thanks! :thumbsup:
---
The small alliances are loosing members due to a weak defense fleet.
---
Why not both?
---
I blame shit tier Devs
---
T1 hulls do not provide "meaningful" losses. You want people flying in T2s and T3s. Thats where the juicy kills are at
---
Oh fuck my titan bounced, lemme ghostride my recon to light this cyno lmao
---
It will be whoever gets on grid first and bubble fucks it to death.
---
Sorry, but I have to support adding local to W-space :( 
---
Cloaky ships can't do shit except dscan, so it is already balanced, IMO

And that's why people want Cyno V... trouble reading mate?

Do it see what happens

I remember being questioned by a UniWiki author about POS, so he could write the article.  Back in the heyday of POS, I sort of became an authority on everything POS.

I also debugged a **lot** of reaction tower setups, even more than gave fitting and placement lessons.

Upwell was a good replacement for outposts, but really sucks as a replacement for POS.

&gt;Yes, L4 mission bots were a thing. The major issue wasnt security although that was botted too; it was distribution. You clearly haven't been around those spaces much or paid attention to the T1 indy traffic.
---
I never said l4's weren't botted at all did I?
---
I said **l4 security missions weren't botted en masse** as in they're the least ones you have to worry about regarding bots, players do them significantly more. 
---
&gt;Belts are full of orcas, and those orcas are almost all players watching Netflix or managing barges. There is nothing amiss with this bottingwise.
---
Wrong, I've seen groups of orcas all switch targets and move a split second after their rock runs out. That's not AFK players. It may be active players, but I still thought it was odd.
---
I've also seen groups align and warp with pretty synced times, which is either a fleet taking warp (in which case why not have covetors or something instead), or a bot fleet.
---
You're likely correct about ventures being more botted, but I'm going by my experience.  I'm absolutely certain I've seen orca bots too. Just like VNI's were the most botted in null, but you still got carrier bots.
---
&gt;. It's okay to admit you don't know rather than move the goalposts and act knowledgeable about it.
---
What? Quote the part where I moved the goalposts.
---
Edit: https://www.macrolab-online.com/forums/17-support/30091-fleet-mining-with-an-orca-in-high-sec
---
A quick internet search shows evidence of people using orca bots. Obviously this isn't representative of all bots in high sec, but it shows 
---
&gt;There is nothing amiss with this bottingwise.
---
That this statement is incorrect.
---
I am a eve veteran and I do not have much time, but assets in nullsec.
---
If your most fun eve experience was making your alliance feed a super and rattlesnakes to save your rorq, you should try other styles of play. Stop letting an FC be the only way you PVP.
---
If we were playing a FPS I could buy a gun that gives me insta kills, and you could be using a free gun that takes 10 bullets to kill me.  
---
If you get the drop on me, or I keep missing because I'm shit, does that mean my insta kill gun isn't P2W? No it's still P2W.  
---
You can kill a 500m ship in your 10m one, but can you beat someone who is equally skilled as you, flying the same ship, but they have max implants and officer fit?
---
go look at average active players pre &amp; post original jump fatigue change and double down on that post
---
HICs are not heavy tacklers, they can hold a well fit and well piloted super for a very short time. The only exception is 100mn HICs, which can hold people too dumb to launch 2 dromis 3 lights (and are also too slow to get initial tackle, and lack the ability to actually probe down a super).
---
Hunting HICs can only tank two shots from a super at most. They rely entirely on cynoing a heavier capital sized tackler before they die. Not allowing them to cyno is beyond silly.
---
You forgot to use the tag &lt;/Robert Downey Jr in Tropic Thunder&gt;

It s bullshit : if i would like to create rorq character farm, i create 3 rorqual pilot on same account while training with 2 mct + 500 plex. Exactly the same.
---
Fit the capital scan rigs and scan your way back in
---
Oh shit hey baby. Vouch me into ya Corp lorenzo
---
I get fights all the time, but it’s not even a matter of getting fair fights. It’s a matter of requiring a more imaginative response than dropping a capital on literally everything. I fly in nano gangs for the exact reasons you mentioned. I don’t ever expect a fair fight in null, but the knee jerk response to just drop caps whenever you’re even remotely in trouble isn’t interesting or exciting gameplay.
---
It massively increases the difficulty of getting a cyno ontop of a capfleet surrounded by defensive bubbles. A cloaked recon might be able to sneak in, but risks decloaking. 
---
Also it means the window of time to jump to a cyno on a hot grid is on the order of seconds
---
That is fine. Alpha is meant to be a free way to taste the game and see if a player feels it is worth buying into. But of course players abuse it, so it has to be nerfed.
---
Well, CCP is maximizing profit, not fixing the things we all have said on this sub are the *real* issues (citadel spam, Fozzie sov, OP cyno jammers, etc.) ..  they're gonna milk it for all it's worth and skill injectors pay the light bill XD

How is it pay2win?

You comparison with real life is beyond stupid.
---
And no, noone wants to nerf social interaction which is the base of the game, just the "save me" button that magically solves problem... if well organized groups are what makes you safe in NS to rat or Rorq mine then, please, STOP FUCKING COMPLAINING ABOUT MECHANICS CHANGES YOU MORON.
---
Id rather have a rorq out in space with a cyno and a chance of getting dropped or getting a kill rather than that rorq being docked up...
---
Yeah it’s literally not worth undocking a ship without a cyno this game sux
---
Pretty sure people will still cry about faxes.
---
Holy shit man. Why?
---
Exactly.  A bit off the topic but I agree that unless you’re protecting a capital asset there needs to be some discouragement for the use of capitals against small groups, solo targets, and for “pheasant” hunting. Nice analogy.
---
I don’t see this as a rage thread...perhaps some of the replies are but the OP seems well reasoned to me even if I disagree with portions of it.

Eve is more fun when ppl don't play like children with silver spoons in their mouths and instead might get that spoon kicked into the back of their throat because most of the time it shouldn't of been in there anyway.

I wish I had a law blog, law is cool from a technical standpoint, best I’ve done though is jury duty.
---
I got lead juror, did a guilty ruling on premeditated homicide, bet that felt like a bomb, dude did a fucked up thing and got caught literally red red handed, so fuck him.
---
1v1 me at sun, wtv ship :) im ready baby
---
Wait until you see the next November changes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Youll be better off without targets? speak for yourself
---
Hmmmmm for this subreddit that pretty positive. 
---
What was his salt?
---
I'm sadly so space poor that I am unaffected by the recent and future changes xD , so can't do that
---
thus the tip about W-space :d
---
Nice.
---
Didnt claim to be my most fun experience just a very exciting one. I remember having a blast a few times dropping some lumpy just saying
---
I saw a wall of text which end s with a positive statement
---
I'm confused
---
I hear some say a fuel cost of some sort. Same thing i guess.
---
Once injectors were implimented, EVE was never the same for me. It was  no longer about who put their knowledge and time into the game to attain their wealth. It became about who had the bigger pockets in real life. A great way to remove the competition and meaning EVE previously had. And a great way to make a game unfair for younger players who now need to compete with those who have deep pockets in real life.
---
1.) Sure. Period Basis, Branch, Cobalt Edge and Omist?
---
2.) This doesn’t actually go with the others, it’s just a common call from people who want free invulnerable staging structures. I still prefer my idea of removing NPC space in null Entirely. Backpack or build a camp if you want to play in someone’s yard.
---
3.) yes. Just delete them.
---
4.) I dislike this idea, because generally it just leads to making life easier for gankers who honestly have it too easy in hisec already, but I could see something being done here.
---
5.) ??
---
6.) not sure there’s any profit in any of these ideas to be honest but even if they were implemented terribly they’d be better than the upcoming cyno dumpsterfire.
---
Yeah the old meta of VNIs was so much more fun to fight, and when a VNI died you knew they weren’t replacing that thing for weeks
---
Interesting.....
---
That's fair, you did. But I'd still highly recommend checking out some other PvP avenues, even if it's alpha clone lowsec frigate pvp. Can be done on the cheap and is a lot of fun.
---
btw baited on flair :(
---
I enjoyed it
---
Upvoted for /s. That was the poor man's meta. Old meta was supers with cynos. Shows you are in cva
---
They were just frustrated at fist that rorqs were getting nerfed and then remember how fun it was to be in danger and fight for what you want instead of hiding from the rain. Basically saying adapting is good, and risk and danger is fun. So its ok that i have to try harder to save my rorq.
---
Yeah no, those are bait (of you didn't catch the hint yet), good luck dropping them... not saying you shouldn't, just that *something* might drop out of a cyno if you do.
---
And I think most Lowsec players are starting to get a little pissed that CCP isn't shaking things up there. The future Venture and Cyno changes will be great (have no doubt there will be an Arazu near those Rorqs in september btw), but we are feeling kind of forgotten (again).
---
*Edit: as a rule of thumb, never ever trust "Lowsec people", they are known to be a bunch of shady and inventive assholes fueled by nothing else than the desire to kill you.*
---
&gt;If you really don't feel like this game is for you then stop posting about it and just move on
---
Hell no. EVE itself may be as fun as staring at lint, but there's years of entertainment still left watching the sunken cost cases on r/eve like you attempt to shill this turd as it sinks to the bottom.
---
Light my cyno harder daddy
---
Lol just reminiscing on good times is all. I have done it all for the most part but was more referring to bomber fleets with an fc leading the hunt ya know.
---
Why not just add more direct wormholes from K-space to K-space. That would shake things up. Give every constellation a random jump to another K-space.  Maybe even make it a permanent wormhole for the day. No limits.
---
I’m not going to dissect that, but skimming through it seems as though in actuality you agree with what I said. “Jump off grid” could be denoted in whichever fashion you like, I just left it open this time I suggested it because people screamed about the star being too predictable. I actually really like the star idea because my biggest issue with cynos is the instant application to combat grid. With a star as desto they will have to warp, which means you can counter with intel and prepare. Defenders could even counter bubble the in/out gates or wormhole etc and try to catch the attackers. It gives everyone much more meaningful stuff to do instead of run from cyno or tank the cyno before the umbrella pops through.
---
If in general this meant EHP on lots of ships was buffed to allow more of a response that’s great, I’d EXPECT that to be part of any balancing honestly.  I just really want to encourage more sub vs sub fleet action and discourage immediately dropping a cap fleet in every single situation. My goal overall is to allow a skilled and organized attacker have the ability to force the defender to bring a subcap response fleet, or at least make their umbrella suffer through bubbles. 
---
Regarding Stuka fleets etc, idk specifically what but potentially that is another necessary act of balancing for another day?
---
You wouldn't know homophobic of it slapped you in the face. How dare you judge my preferences in the content I want to see on reddit. Hopefully the political revolving door doesnt slap you on the ass as you leave my zone of free speech.
---
Lousy third-party forum software.

I abandoned those forums when it was introduced.  I was in the top 15 posters (13?) up until then.

Is this a stupid question?
---
If you want to break up the big blocks make resources more scarce  and spread out.
---
I believe they gave it a minor buff to power grid or capacitor recently.
---
Wot? Playing L4's isn't abusing anything. The isk/hour isn't extremely high.
---
Is that a real question?
---
It's actually worth reading tbh, he has the right attitude.
---
are they a bitch to kill? I have yet to encounter one
---
I live in highsec, haul in highsec for my kind of fun. There have been times when my playstyle was threatened - such as when the 'bug' was fixed on sisi that prevented cloak+mwd from working, and also the *long and terrible* time while remote cargo deposit did not exist on structures, and scam contracts were *everywhere*.
---
These kinds of things I have had to adapt to, to survive.
---
For the loss cloak+mwd? I developed a cheap fit I thought would work, had more tank. Would have been easily caught by a ganker should they have wanted to do so - but there was always a good chance of that happening anyway.
---
For contract scams? I paid attention to where things were going *to* as well as *from* - if someone had an order going to a structure that I did not personally know, I simply didn't run it. I saved myself a lot of trouble that way, and not even once got caught by a scam contract.
---
In the end, the cloak+mwd 'fix' was undone, and remote cargo deposit unexpectedly came out of the blue to fix the other problem...
---
But I still had to adapt. I'm still having to adapt even now to minor changes - triglavians in general, for one.
---
Still, my troubles aren't on the same scale - but my point is, even I have to adapt to game changes.
---
If you want to play this game? You have to be willing to roll with the punches - embrace the changes. If your gameplay is ruined by this change? Find something else to do, that you *can* do.
---
Or don't. Maybe there's absolutely nothing else you want to do in this game than the one single thing you were doing - I find that pitiful, but I can imagine that could happen.
---
In that case? Goodbye.
---
I’ll agree he didn’t really seem very ragey.
---
I thought you guys said stain guy was a shit poster?
---
fuck code
---
Cloaky ships provide warpins, they can also decloak right on top of you and shoot you, they can still light cynos, etc. They can do plenty.
---
Not everything is about caps.
---
Now try long range scram HIC on a battleship.
---
I think they want to make the ships cynos  more than dispensable though. They want cynos to actually cost something. Hence the reason cheap cruisers cant fit them only more expensive recons
---
Currently HICs can only actually catch supercaps by sacrificing almost all tank, otherwise hyperspatial fit supers can not only leave grid before they land but also outwarp them indefinitely until they're ready to cyno out.
---
Even 100mn active tanked HICs bleed heavily against a double dromi triple light super, and against multiple supers using support fighters just instadie.
---
Unless you consider getting initial HIC tackle to be fleet warping 3 + 5 guardians (in which case lol if the super doesn't just warp) they're just objectively bad at catching and golding supers.
---
You're *really* salty about this.
---
&gt; you want big prey, spend a little isk
---
Agreed.
---
A friend parked an alt with a cyno on a jump bridge.  He'd lose a revelation on nearly every attack, but he got a lot of freighter and JF kills.
---
He copy-pasta the messages to me that he received.  Lots of them calling him stupid for being ISK negative.
---
He didn't care.
---
He was having fun, and had untold billions (from industry) to throw away.  He even did monthly out-of-pocket ISK bonus payouts to top corp PvPers, just because he could.
---
IDEALLY you can prompt a sub cap response fleet to fight with the changes I’ve suggested. I’m not in it to kill your orca or rorqual nearly as much as I am to have a good exciting fight. Getting dropped by a couple Erebus every single time is not exciting, it’s quite boring actually.
---
PI alts have to start fitting tank mods on haulers. What ever will we do...
---
That seems like a pretty good solution. Maybe they require Cap Booster 800s or some such, a large-volume charge with a very limited capacity in your hold, so your cloak is useful for short-term tactical cloaking to get the drop on an enemy and not long-term stakeouts.
---
It will also mean that fueltrucks need to bring along cap boosters as well, decreasing the amount of fuel they can bring and so increasing the logistical difficulties of a covops/blops fleet, nerfing a playstyle that has gotten a little too powerful as of late.
---
But the helios is so ugly....
---
No, for the residents, it does NOT stop escalating every fight to capitals. Reships available, and ISK is not a limiting factor. Pilgrims go above 100k EHP, and all you need is a FAX to jump immediately. Small gangs will still get dicked down hard, and any gang that does not bring at least one Force Recon and shows it off WILL get hotdropped 100%, because otherwise there's nothing that can counterdrop. (Sure, you could bring a cov ops, light a covops cyno, bridge a force recon on it, light another cyno, and THEN drop your stuff, ... but that sounds like bringing a Recon with extra steps.)
---
From the formless void's gaping maw, there springs an entity...
---
Its rather sad how every change recently is justified by saying anyone who left is an afker or a bot and they won't be missed. Because its only a matter of time before that narrative turns into "where'd everyone go, why is nullsec empty, this shit is boring CCP, ruined all my small gang content." And once you get there good luck getting players to come back, even if you revert the changes you have lost their trust by acting like an asshole as you implemented them the first time around over their objections and valid arguments.
---
I second this. Get a naglfar and some friends to run C4s
---
&gt;tuskers flair
---
fuck off
---
Oh so actually positive things. Nice!
---
True, but CCP doesn't care.
---
How exactly does a posi-trac rear-end on a Plymouth work? It just does.
---
Gotta wait between spawns, it was nearly 2 days last time. 
---
&gt;Also TVP is also probably out DPSing W2M IIRC.
---
I believe so, W2M have newbro friendly fits that aren't optimal DPS, I don't think TVP do the same. When I've flown with warp to me, we've lost probably 4 contests and won 2. A spooled up leshak is hard to beat in terms of DPS, so they win the tower bashes almost all the time.
---
using a marauder is just asking to be killed
---
You sir are a rare bird.
---
&gt;The whole concept is so that it costs something to have a cyno and to invest caps.
---
This is a seriously roundabout way to accomplish that. Could have easily made the cyno module itself very pricey. I don't really think simply increasing the price of cyno usage was the primary goal. 
---
&gt;It also makes it harder to get a cyno into place. You either have to invest an expensive BS or hope your recon can get in.
---
Again, this is accomplished fairly easily with a wide variety of ships. In fact it could be argued most non-covert ships have it harder than recons. The most significant capability losses right now are access to nullified T3s and capitals. 
---
Putting aside the lack of diversity in ship choice, it just plain boggles me why they made the effort to include BLOPs. The things can't even warp cloaked ffs. And before anyone thinks that the jump-drive is its main calling there, do not forget that it can also bridge in recons which are cheaper and much better suited for the task in most respects.
---
Can EvE finally get the system wide decloak structure they previewed years ago?  Give us the ability to clean out or hunt the cloaky campers, or is that not chaotic enough?
---
Why on Earth would you use a HIC to scram a battleship as opposed to a ceptor, jaguar or similar?
---
It was a little touch and go with my Beam laser legion but i was able to kill them even landing as close as 15km from them. If you wanna do it i reccomend something that can track a lot better and kite faster (at 1.3km/s they could hold around 16km range on me making kiting with beams hard.)
---
You’re correct. I just assumed straight up another salt thread.Occasionally some posts worth reading make it onto this sub reddit.
---
&gt;Life isn't supposed do be safe
---
Yes thats something that literally everyone says /s
---
i'd wager a large slice of cake that at one point in time i was bigger than you are right now.
---
feel free to point me to the metrics that prove that none of the people that quit after that ever resubbed lmao
---
What do you mean when you say they aren’t working on the new player experience. They redid the agency window.
---
that may have some consequences on the wormhole playstyle
---
OP mentioned the Imicus so I assumed he was mostly Gallente focused. I do agree that the Buzzard is absolutely the best choice for covops frigates.
---
never not take the bait, that's content ! :D (and yes, so many shiny stuff on field in fucking TAMA, oviously there would be stuff on stand by :p )
---
4-5guys will work with T2 cats. Go Tornado if fancy
---
There are reportedly people with over 1000 characters farming SP. No way did they do this for the character bazaar, that would be too much work, and not enough demand. Most people don't want to buy new characters, they want to make their own with their own names. Skill injectors really aren't comparable.
---
You also cannot prove that HS ganking caused the drop in players.  It's just as likely that people hate citadels, got old and stopped playing video games, or started playing Fortnite.  Any of those are as likely an explanation.  Without CCP's internal data, we will never know.  So again, correlation is not causation.
---
They said Orcas -- presumably there's more than one.
---
For sure. I would love a black lagoon skin. Fk all the anime haters.
---
For a guy who's never been ganked, you certainly have VERY strong opinions.  Methinks you're either lying about never dying in hisec, or lying about being a miner.  Or both.  If you weren't, you wouldn't care so much.  Link killmail please.
---
Dude it's a game. If you want to be a 'rich player', PLAY THE GAME MORE!
---
If not, shut the fuck up about being poor. Who gives a shit how many zeroes your wallet has.
---
It's bad enough we have socialists/commies trying to ruin the real world; now you lazy pieces of shit can't even not be lazy IN A FUCKING GAME??
---
Nice to see the Mira Chieve Special Meme Heron make a comeback after nearly three years &lt;3
---
Streamers?
---
I always wondered why people who only PvP in huge fleets need so much money
---
No, I meant exactly what I said. Titans/Supers don't just suppress small and nano-gang, it suppresses anyone who can't escalate properly within someone's umbrella, or even near it. If you're not smart enough to see why that's an issue, then get back to your spod and/or threats to unsub. Your assertion that time/isk is a factor is fucking dumb since you can buy isk (via PLEX) and you can buy skill points. Which many, many people have done. Also stymied by the fact that the last 5 years have basically been free isk printing for anyone in a null-bloc (I ran an alliance in a null-bloc so I'm not just some nano-guy that has an axe to grind)
---
Sure, but they aren't necessarily that bad of consequences. Wormholers should be more vulnerable too, and IME the only time we cloak up for long periods is during bomber fleets, and bomber fleets should be vulnerable while they're staging and waiting for a drop. Currently a good FC can ensure that a bomber fleet is practically untouchable right up until they drop on a target, making counterplay incredibly difficult.
---
Ever since I started eve I have been in catch up mode. Just as I skill into the doctrine a new one comes up. It was annoying then because I had to wait. It is annoying now because I have to pay.
---
That's kind of the idea, isn't it?  Maybe a gank starts it all, but everyone is there for the response fleet.  Until that fleet turns out to be 3 FAXes, a couple dreads, and a Titan or six.
---
That's not a low sec problem, that's an eve problem
---
So are highsec gankers the cause of null whales quitting as well?  Otherwise your theory has a hole in it.  Because null sec leaving the game at the same time highsec leaving the game indicates the cause is something affecting both groups, and we know that can't be CODE.
---
Its not a drop like that. Its moongoo, finite amount plus the fact that people are farming less since less people in general are actually mining atm. There is no way to produce more than there actually already is (maybe some, but far from enough).
---
Battle Heron don't take no shit.
---
Goons and tapi are exactly zero threat to each other so the distance doesn't matter.
---
Easy marks are more like junk food leading up to the real confrontation you're looking for. Getting dropped on when the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor are 'reasonable.'
---
What's unreasonable is when you decide to take a fight you have maybe 40/60 odds at best and they decide to drop anyways. :V
---
I mean you can use a paladin, but should you use a paladin is a whole other thing. (in case it's not obvious from other replies in this thread the answer is "NO").
---
Lol what a douche grath you are.  Always have been always will be.. and dont come here with your caps you stupid old redneck cunt. Go fuck yourself.
---
Why don't you go quit eve again like a big cry baby when you cried about all the shit you didnt agree with...stupid twat GTFO.
---
Just because you were part of shit PL that you fucked up and that's why it's in the shit state it's in now because you're a terrible leader then dont come try it here with your bullying tactics it wont work with me.
---
And just let's get this straight the game mechanics clearly make you have another account just to jump a ship regardless for a solo player.   Hows it that fucking hard for your stupid brain to understand.
---
Dont ever enter my conversations again.
---
dirty blobber
---
I feel this is and should be very dependent on the class, which is reflected in the kinds of statics they can have and the size of the holes. Example, our space doesn't accept anything larger than a battleship and is easy to roll, but it's low class.
---
Without local there is no way at all to know if there's currently a cloaky camper in a bomber waiting for you. I don't see why people say that a cloaky ship can't do anything. It's not like the bomber can't tackle your carrier (if ratting that is) and cyno in a bunch of T3Cs.
---
After the changes as they are as of now the carrier or bigger can't even cyno in the defence for whatever reason. Nothing but buffs to cloakies tbf, and we still can't do anything to people literally sitting AFK all day in this ErA oF cHaOs - Even less so without knowing for sure if there's someone in the system with you or not.
---
I’ve come to realize that, and it’s saddening. The group I play with are a rare bunch. Eve has been moving further and further from Sub PvP so we try and get what we can before it’s all gone.
---
Really fucking impressive, very well done!
---
I'm totally trying something similar as soon as I can, that was inspiring.
---
*Edit: good music selection aswell.*
---
Most people flying capitals have alts anyway, the cyno changes just make it a little more time consuming to respond. I'm curious if people will start ratting or mining and just put up a cyno inhibitor, if you're in a capital you don't need to worry about small gang to a certain degree. Blops are... blops... not much changes or can be done about that unless you have panic. So in reality nothing much changes when it comes to PVE capital usage. It actually probably makes it less likely you will be cyno dropped. If a large fleet is moving through Alliance space its rare that's its a surprise, even with the blackout. So all its really telling me is I have to worry less about interceptors having cynos on them. So in my mind it actually makes nullsec safer.
---
&gt;This is an area of the game I have zero experience with.
---
Congratulations!  You have just as much experience as the people designing this change!
---
what cyno changes, what are cynos? 
---
new player btw
---
&gt;But in all seriousness eve has gone stale
---
eve isn't stale because you could afk rat and mine under a supercap umbrella.
---
it was because there was 0 reason to ever come out from under it. there was nothing to drive conflict - there still isn't.
---
look at the last 2 big wars involving the biggest entities. one of them wasn't even a war it was just an afk structure grind the defender seemed to forget to turn up to. regardless, neither of them were a result of in-game mechanics it was the result of a 12 year old grudge that one guy has. if that guy didn't have a 12 year old hate boner for another group of players the game would've been even more stale than it was for the last 24 months.
---
Nag for C4's?
---
I'm just astounded that 200 people fly a Proteus.
---
"This definitely needed a whole new thread" said no-one ever
---
Oh don't get me wrong, I never said you shouldn't go a check what actually comes out of the cyno. I know I would (and did).
---
Lol this was when they were good. Right about the time of the fighter changes.
---
CCP in a month: you guys were supposed to stop using caps...
---
I don’t disagree.
---
I would honestly appreciate if someone linked to the relevant dev blog/discussion, too. Couldn’t find it earlier.

&gt;I thought EVE had a hardcore playerbase, one that new how to "adapt". 
---
i said it earlier and i'll say it again, with regards to this 'chaos' stuff 
---
&gt;The problem is that in most cases adapting doesn't mean do the activity differently, it just means go and do a different activity.
---
The character bazaar paid better for the SP.  You use generic, non-offensive names, and train FOTM.  When skill queue limit was increased, it got really easy.  Much less management than comparable numbers of sp farms too, since you don't have to log in and extract them as often.
---
I don't know if the purported 1000 character SP farm is real, but that's a royal pain.  I still suspect thats r/eve hyperbole, and for that to be used as any sort of baseline for average SP farms is definitely hyperbole.  
---
Starting a new sellable character each day/week/month, in an eve without injectors, pays better with less effort than sp farms.  Especially if you have an alt account with an open slot, you want to keep active, but have no need for additional training.  Like cyno or PI alts.
---
just adapt lmao
---
There has been 16+ years of balance changes, FoTM meta cycles, and huge swings in ship popularity for all sorts of reasons. There are plenty of objectively meaningful changes out there. 
---
Also, just because you dislike a change doesn't mean it isn't meaningful. In fact the more you feel strongly about it the more meaningful it is.
---
hardcore players were pre-chaos changes... CCP is having to handicap the game for you shitters b/c you're so awful at the game - these changes are essentially the same as CCP feeling bad for you so they gave you a padded helmet
---
Dude, fuck off. Seriously. We constantly are barraged here with your stupid ass ideas, why can this guy make a proposal here? Makes you just look like a whiny bitch, which, isn't too far off I reckon.
---
One of the main reasons i stopped playing.
---
Oh? So how do you plan to move your capitals... Gate to gate?
---
I expect at that point they'll switch to a "smaller is better" cope, how finally rid of the chaff they've reach the purest state of eve, bechamel sauce metaphors "eve, only gets better as it reduces" and so on and so forth.
---
Oi oi, the last one wasn´t that long ago! I was just doing different ships. I know, heresy.
---
&gt; With a star as desto they will have to warp, which means you can counter with intel and prepare.
---
Right but do keep in mind that part of my suggestion is to make it more difficult to just deny the response via bubbling. The cyno to star and the slow warp time to the site after a fleet align is already a huge delay. Being able to potentially control on grid where people land is another huge issue.
---
&gt; I’m not going to dissect that, but skimming through it seems as though in actuality you agree with what I said.
---
Somewhat. I think things are fine as is but I’m willing to compromise for the sake of changes to try and keep more people playing and engaged.
---
What I’m not really excited about is change for changes sake where that just turns into a big weight on one side. Blackout was a great example of a good change that made some people uncomfortable but was ultimately a change that affected most sides relatively equally albeit in somewhat different ways.
---
&gt; If in general this meant EHP on lots of ships was buffed to allow more of a response that’s great, I’d EXPECT that to be part of any balancing honestly.  I just really want to encourage more sub vs sub fleet action and discourage immediately dropping a cap fleet in every single situation.
---
We agree on this part, even though subs are incredibly tedious and boring in my opinion as a fleet. Not because I’m an elite PVPer who thinks F1 monkeying is bad, but because the subcap meta is so incredibly predictable currently. I’d love to see less of a focus on Caps vs Subs and more of a focus on actually making subcap fights more interesting.
---
&gt; Regarding Stuka fleets etc, idk specifically what but potentially that is another necessary act of balancing for another day?
---
I mean see above. I feel like if you do changes to a problem that are dramatic then they should at least touch all parts. Fighting a Stuka fleet or any booshy doctrine with subs isn’t an exciting prospect. I don’t want to see the fleet type nerfed or die, I’d just want more effective options to fight them with.
---
If you're gonna use a Nag, just do C5s tbh
---
The spirit of the changes is that Hilmar is on crack.
---
No, they're making these changes because you made the game boring and gay.
---
200 bombers are the new pl alts
---
Injectors make them money. I wish there was, but there is no taking them back now. Everyone already injected into their capitals, and got their capital ships. But they can nerf capitals to make them a meaningful selection, among many other ships; and not the only option for everything. So thats naturally how the game is changing.
---
Shhh don’t tell them our secret
---
You couldn't repair pos shields when the tower was in reinforced. What you could do is repair the damaged modules so that the guns would come online when the tower exited reinforced. 
---
Was also common to prestage triage chimeras on an important POS right as the tower exited reinforced. If you could bank on the attackers being lazy or otherwise delayed you could triage for a single cycle to get it over 50% then boat into the shields. If you had enough chimeras you could start your triage while moving towards the shields to cut down the time your carriers would be vulnerable.
---
Interesting, wonder how a gila would do. I am slowly working towards lv5 cruiser for amarr/cald. Currently at lv 4 for both. I doubt my pulse confessor would be worth using even though my current fit dps is \~450 with around 1700MS in sharpshooter mode.
---
just adapt man
---
Dreads cant rep more then 4/5 dreads.... so getting intona small fight of 10 v 10 means theyre gonna have to be buffer.....you could try and buff local reps, but then you break haw dreads balance. Fleet dreads expect to die, the only purpose they have is to burn out everything before they die, and deal as much dps as possible
---
hey everyone said adapt or die so we adapted , we already are adapting to new changes dw lol. All i want is for ccp to actually balance caps and supers and for them to nerf eagles feroxes munnins online but hey they keep throwing niche dumb stuff around.
---
no, sp loss is a complete garbage mechanic, it needs to be removed, not spread around

They can burst up to 3.2km/s so keep that in mind. They did odd things while i was kiting them cycling thier WMD on and off rapidly slowing down their average speed but i can't assure you that's what they will do when you encounter them.

People are going to use tobacco. Not only is nicotine highly addictive (especially when in conjunction with other chemicals in the planet), but it's wonderful and actually has health benefits.

So, would you rather people smoked, spit wads of tobacco juice, or vaped?

Supposedly every character in this corp is an SP farm: [https://evewho.com/corp/B0T3T3+M4ST3R5](https://evewho.com/corp/B0T3T3+M4ST3R5)  
---
By using corp hangers you can very quickly log in, extract &amp; plex using hanger, put the injector back into corp hanger, log out. Apparently it's about 30 secs per character, per month.  
---
A lot lot less work than trying to sell 1000 characters on the exchange, and worrying that the FOTM will change before the character sells.
---
I was also astounded that a wormhole group brought 200 Proteii through a wormhole.  Not saying OP is a liar, but I'd like to see the BR on that one.
---
I too enjoy training a skill that takes 50 days every time i loose a cap

take nagl go c5 as quoted, role holes, dont open other ones, easy save isk print there.

4x Mining Drones, each on a different rock, 1x Hobgoblin just orbiting.

:realChamp:
---
please point where they lost the ability to catch caps
---
Seems like a nice change on paper. I haven't been subbed in years because I simply have no interest in capitals. I don't want to fly one, and I don't like to fight them, so I quit the game and did other things with my time. I'm certainly keeping an eye on how things develop.
---
It's infinite, it's just limited by time and active engagement. If it has value, players will farm it.
---
he means we lost alreade 2k average PCU, while new player experience stays the same and is atm trig invasion camped (soa arc). So we lose more player's per month as we get new players and the cyno changes will increase the speed of the player drain. Also you can compare Dotlan overall Stats in killed Faction (NPC'S) and killed ships for the different month this year and prior years. While July just had minor impact the august impact is really there even when we are midmonth for Nullsec. Hisec has ruly the same numbers for years same for lowsec with a minor drop, but nullsec drop is significant, and yes i know we are midmonth but just double the numbers monkas.
---
Seriously 
---
Recons are paper ships I hope you are trolling
---
Adapt or quit? Oh right that applies to "others" not to one's self.
---
That's only a reasonable argument it your only thinking short term. It's the kind of thinking that has been driving AAA publishers like EA for a while now. Given how predictable the results tend to be, it's no surprise that the people who have invested their time and treasure into Eve are not happy to see the same mindset infecting CCP, too.
---
&gt;Embrace the chaos.
---
I keep seeing this used.  You've never quit a game for changes you didn't like?  You've never voiced your displeasure over changes?  Everyone just has to accept it and that's that?  Where in the world does this kind of mentality come from?
---
They could do that by increasing fitting requirements though rather than limiting hulls. Still allows for player meta development
---
I don’t mind the memes - I can find the humor in them.  
---
I simply wanted to bring attention to a real issue in rural nullsec. I’m positive there are issues in large blocs that would seem unbelievable to me as well.  
---
I agree - this is a large part of the debate - rural / blocs.
---
Someone doesnt keep up with memes tsk tsk
---
Have 31-51 recons on standby in system
---
Oh this is an easy one. I switch to my other monitor, bring up Eve forums and type a strongly worded post about how I’m unsubbing all 75 of my mining alts. I then get on the eve Facebook group and do the same.
---
What about null to null capital sized wormholes that only spawned on the furthest edge of nullsec.
---
Unfit for single ply toilet paper.
---
&gt; So are highsec gankers the cause of null whales quitting as well?
---
What a stupid question.
---
Tell me how this can't be exploited by creating alts
---
And it makes sense to have an Orca just sit there and be defense versus something like a vni how?
---
I didn't say it caused the drop in players.  I'm suggesting things like high sec ganking are one of the many reasons this game struggles to retain new players.
---
I lol’d
---
What caps?
---
Pushing injectors and high cost DLC without considering and planning to mitigate the consequences gives me the impression that CCP (and/or their new overlords) are more interested in sucking as much cash out of the game now than they are in fostering stable growth over the long term. Instead of investing in the future of Eve, they keep spending (or wasting) money trying to crank out new games. Eve has had a longer shelf life than most online games, but nothing lays forever; so it's no surprise that CCP is trying to diversify before too Eve stops being profitable enough to keep them from getting real jobs. The only problem is that they keep failing to launch the next big thing; and every time they do, it becomes a little less likely that they ever will.
---
&gt; The five stages of grief are chronologically: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.
---
Still in Bargaining phase I see.
---
Wish i could turn back time to the barleguet days
---
agree its just a mastermind invention for all changes good post lol. Wormholer's these days need new narratives until everyone eyes are on your save isk C5's?
---
Maybe things changed but last I played, alpha couldn't do anything remotely profitable to earn enough ISK for plex
---
not really pay to win since i havent spent a single dollar on EvE in over 3 years and have spent 386b on injectors since their release.  
---
(Praise Excel, Glory to Bob)
---
I'm just annoyed that I have to train my alt now up for a ship it will never use outside of lighting a Cyno for my main to move my carrier around.  Moving my Carrier has just gotten much more of a pain in the ass for the individual player without several accounts.  I might as well sell my Carrier now.  This even more encourages Capital Alts... I used to have 6 accounts, I'm happy with 2 that I have now.  I don't have the time to farm the ISK to pay for several accounts anymore so I don't mind paying the $30 a month.  I get the point to the changes, but this kinda sucks for the more casual player.
---
You can’t invade someone without capitals. Everyone has a capital group in their home, so if you don’t bring capitals, all your subs will just die constantly as you try to invade. If it’s even harder to move around, goodbye any effort to fight. Defender has such a huge advantage already, now it’s even worse
---
If you have enough titans do DD the other sides titans in coordinated volleys, you can leave the FAX shooting to dreads.
---
pos roles were guarded pretty closely back then so almost certainly just an account that got shared between directors across multiple timezones
---
man relax eve needs chaos right so that all of eve runs dry of people beside c5's.
---
I don't see how taking away the guns from low sec make it any more interesting. I often feel safer in WH space than low sec - and on top of that at least I know I will get a payout. If we want to make low sec similar to pirate null then we should at least change the risk/reward/activities that can be done there.
---
What is rural NS? Is that where simple farmers live?
---
Assault Machariels.

alternatively the unpiloted super will still die to the bomber fleet because it now has no tank modules online

no joke i heard panfam and goons are now mindmapping a doctrine force recon fleet for capital escalation with 100+ dudes in it.

Hey, I never said there's something wrong with what you do, I just wanted to warn that poor confused newbro about.

I am little surpised I haven't seen you guys in bait Rorqs until recently, but that's about it.

I'm curious, where do bpc's like that drop? Npc dread? Data site? Incursion?

Join a corp, proper ones will give you war dues and big ships to fly. They need bodies, they have the money.

As someone who started playing last week, this was 95% gibberish to me. Lol

Leave Hypnotoad alone
---
You are right. But the global isk/hour was clearly high enough for them to decide to restrict L4. If L3 is not enough isk/hour for a players preference maybe they should buy omega.
---
Alphas have always been capable of earning enough ISK to PLEX. Ever since the list of ships alphas could use was expanded, the list of activities has been pretty long.
---
The fastest and easiest way (especially since blackout began) has always been exploration. It's entirely possible to pay for your subscription in a single day if you get lucky enough.
---
Beyond that, incursions pay well enough (although this has become harder since incursions were nerfed) to PLEX fairly quickly.
---
Alphas used to be able to do L4 missions, which paid enough to make it possible to plex consistently with enough effort, but are now limited to L3 missions. Still possible, but really not worth the time investment and effort compared to other options.
---
Finally, gas huffing. Huffing is profitable enough that alphas are able to plex using them with a pretty fair amount of effort and time investment.

I got a question regarding rate of fire and server ticks. I understand that 1 server tick = 1 second. So if my rate of fire is 1.99 seconds, it'll take 2 server ticks (rounded up) to apply damage. And if my rate of fire is 2.01, it'll take 3 server ticks? 
---
If this is true, a rate of fire of 1.99s can fire three volleys in 6 seconds, while a rate of fire of 2.01s can only fire two volleys. A difference of 0.02s can increase my dps by 50%. Is this accurate?
---
That's it! I've had enough of CCP and their ass.  These new changes to ignore walking in stations are literally an insult to every autist who has aspergers.  I am currently unsubbing my  69 accounts.  I hope you're happy CCP you have ruined the game for weebs! Goodbye forever, Bob Sagat! CCP! I hope your 514 revival game gets ported to PC!
---
Definitely going to make moving caps between holes or caps that get rolled out a huge pita.
---
That said probably a positive net change if it means that any nullsec roam doesn't get dropped on by a super fleet
---
Dude, because, the game company is trying to curb cynos and his idea doesn't fall in line with that, also, Dude, because, theres quite literally a thread Devs are reading on their forums, they're not coming hear to read this fucking schmucks singular thread.
---
Oh, and Dude, you're quite literally exposed to my ideas on pretty much one subject, Marauders, however, its also due to the fact that I'm just generally a better person than you, which means my input is worth more than yours.
---
Because you're fucking stupid.
---
No, I haven't. I've quit playing games when they became boring or uninteresting. The change is likely to make EVE less boring and more interesting.
---
I have no problem with you voicing your displeasure. In fact, I have no problem with you quitting over the changes. Do as you please. Just know that you're not actually one of "us" if you do.
---
A fair reply mate. Regarding the bubble control I would really just hope to use it as an incentive to field a sub fleet first to remove any bubbles or other nasty surprises for caps, less so to stop them from arriving altogether. IF you think bubbles would be too oppressive altogether then that would actually be an argument for the cyno to have ships land randomly off grid around 1 AU or something similar, opposed to on a star grid. Then it could not be totally controlled via bubbles as the caps warp in individually from random directions. Would also rely a bit more on individual skill not mid-warping etc.

EVE has always been pay to win, but, for some reason, EVE players choose to be blind to it unlike in many other games. Yes, your skill is still involved in *some* engagements, so you can call it "pay to skip" to make yourself feel better -- but in any other game, *skipping* to end-game content is pay to win. EVE players steadfastly differentiate between "win" and "skip" because "skill" is involved -- but again, in any other game, *skipping* to end-game content, or gaining any material advantage in-game, even in a skill-based game, is still referred to as pay to win. EVE is one of the few hold-outs where its players try to defend CCP with every breath they take; it's mildly amusing. But at the end of the day, a blob of capitals funded by real-world cash only relies on the skill of a few select individuals commanding the blob no matter how long the reddit warriors argue that every action performed in game is 100% pure skill.
---
He's got a point though
---
Paragraphs are cool.
---
Pre-blackout, NS was safer than HS by a significant degree. Now it is not. This is why you're seeing less activity in null; because most of EVE's null players are not actually the game's elite PvP kings like they'd have you believe. They are, in fact, the risk-averse, deck-stacking ship spinners that we all detest.
---
I don't buy that the recent changes have hurt EVE. They are making EVE great again.
---
Dam now I really want to see how my confessor will do. Though I have a feeling their tracking is fast so they will end up popping me haha.
---
You look like your dodging the point mate
---
What if he finds you unattractive?
---
its actually exactly the point
---
Injectors are really not a problem.  The problem is CCP has never had a future-proof plan for balancing various aspects of the game.  They've continually try balancing with game design aspects that are external to how a ship performs, as if that's a balancing factor:  
---
Production Costs - (Both in time and in resources) Titans originally were designed with extreme production costs aimed to be a limiting factor.  Even now, supercaps need to be built in Sov Nullsec.  However, as time progresses, the resources in this game infinitely grow, meaning that production costs will always be overcome in the future unless the ship in question dies faster than it is used.  This was part of the vision for titans, initially, but CCP underestimated the playerbase, and Titans proliferated to the extreme.  Frankly, production Costs are not a barrier anymore.  If CCP introduce a new ship tomorrow with a trillion-isk resource requirement and a year cooking time... we'd see them proliferate in the same way... with the number of said ships steadily increasing in Magnitude.  While the first titan was a big deal, there are now over 10,000 titans in the game.  
---
SP - This was used to pace progression in the game and eventually limit access to ships behind a time investment.  However, this encouraged character rmt'ing, and eventually resulted in the character bazaar, which ultimately opened up a way to enhance a players progression pace while maintaining the character progression pace.  Lol, in 2008, I remember all the "elite" corps that had a 10k SP minimum.  But again, CCP underestimated their own game.  Fast forward 10 years into the future, and there are so many characters  that there was no point in restricting a character's progression to time.  This was especially true because the game had progressed to the point that you needed a significant amount of SP to be an effective cog in many corporations.  Skill injectors are just a way of allowing players to create a new unique character, with a fresh history, while also allowing them to progress quickly to mid and late game content.  
---
Rarity - The only true forms of rarity in this game are those unable to be farmed.  For example, the AT Prizes.  These ships are blatantly overpowered, but their forced rarity keeps them proliferating.  Unfortunately, though... even they proliferate in the arena, where the advantages they provide are economically justified.  
---
My point, balancing ships around external factors like "price" or "SP" is bad design when there's no limit to people farming or progressing.  They really need to balance game play in a Rochambeau manner or in a constant state of shifting imbalances.
---
I'm not your mate.  I'll leave you to keep posting whilst I have a nice cuppa and chuckle
---
Meanwhile there are dozens of corporations and NPSI organizations that would have been happy to have you and teach you and even given you free ships.
---
You failed because of you, not because of the game.
---
We could be friends though
---
Ever been to the drone regions?
---
Ivana/VOC are doing the same in Molden Heath
---
I dont know stuff about caps why would a rev not work?
---
I can’t wait to see 100 cynos light at once.
---
 “Cynos are up jump to literally anyone!”
---
&gt;"Easy to catch up for new players" With what isk? The one you buy with real money, thinking you're gonna be able to reach anything with your new bought skills of ships you have no idea on how to fly... 
---
Imagine being the type of person who would rather use a cheat code to beat a game than play the content legitimately.
---
&gt;If you would've quit the game because you couldn't use injectors thats a clear sign that something else is wrong with the game thats not gonna be fixed by injectors.
---
The real question is, why are you not part of the 30-50 feral force recons?
---
I can remember living in Cloud ring in 2009/2010 and scanning out drug sites, I would leave my ishtar afk clearing the site while I drove my son to school, come home and warp in a hacker to hack the cans and safely get both accounts home.  I agree nullsec was always safe
---
Its not. And people wont. There are regional aspect to it aswell plus moongoo is regulated. Alliances tend to stockpile and control the market.
---
To make it easier to understand, if there arent enough people mining then there arent. If theres not enough moons to cover the need then there isnt. So sure, it might have value, but the process is lenghty and complicated which means its not clearcut. And the same goo is used in other T2 processes so there will always be competition there as well.
---
That would be considered a wasteland surely
---
Tries lol
---
&gt;"*We have 16,000 unique new players each week, and we lose 90% of them.*"
---
&gt;"*Luckily we can farm a few Jackson's off them before they depart.*"
---
I know I'm not being very charitable. In my heart I think CCP is trying the best they can. They are basically a gaming company started out of a frozen garage.
---
&gt;which id be shocked if they dont at all.
---
Welcome to Eve.  Enjoy your stay.
---
Btw, CCP said they'd revisit FozzieSov when they introduced it.  They also said they'd revisit lots and lots of game mechanics.
---
The builders
---
hey ! although there is always something new to learn in EVE, I do not consider myself a newbro :'( Been playing for nearly 3 years
---
I just thought it was funny, seing rorqs and excavator there while everyone in null is bunkering down :D  I just wish ppl were less reticent to go hunt there. When I was in a null-sec block, NO ONE but those comign from lowsec wanted to go that way. A shame, plenty of stuff to shoot at, but they all prefered to roam boringly and aimlessy in null :/
---
Eve has been a pay for SP game from birth.
---
5-6 years ago when I first tried eve, I realised no matter how much time I spent playing I couldn't use effort and smart play to catch up so stopped playing. Eve had the ISK and time grind.
---
It was $15 a month for 2 years if I wanted to play a lot of the ships - $360.  Now you can up front pay the $360 to be able to play the ships you want now. There is no significant difference.
---
Now it's a balancing issue as a lot more of the player base can access the higher end ships.
---
&gt;Its not.
---
A resource that respawns indefinitely isn't infinite?
---
&gt;if there arent enough people mining then there arent
---
If supply is low and demand is high, sounds like an opportunity which people will flock to and drive down the price.
---
&gt;And the same goo is used in other T2 processes so there will always be competition there as well.
---
Which drives down price.
---
I mean, quitting isn't fighting. If you don't like this gam, stop playing it. If you like this game, keep playing it. But don't play the game because you want a bunch of faceless nerds on the internet to not call you a sissy. It's your time and your money. I quit EQ back in the day when they went on their Werebeast beng. I quit WoW when they were turning away from phenomenal cosmic events to a stupid factional war, and they kept nerfing my favorite class for two expansions. I'll quit Eve since they haven't bothered to update PvE to be more dynamic and fun and have only made it more of a drag to do with each patch. I'll spend my time and money on something else. If Eve still does it for you, keep going. Just be honest. That's all I'm asking.
---
In order to do well in EVE, you usually need both player skill and character resources. Having more resources alone isn't going to compensate for a lack of skill in using those resources to their greatest potential, but given two opponents of comparable skill, the one with more resources will have a discernible advantage. And since in-game resources can be directly purchased with out of game money, the group that can outspend their *equally skilled and numerous* opponents will tend to win.  
---
Think of it this way. If you were a pro tennis player with shitty gear and I was an amateur with top of the line gear, you'll probably still beat me. But if we were both pros, but I had great gear while you had to play in ill fitting runners and a shitty Walmart racket, more likely than not I'm going to beat you instead. Same for EVE. If we were equally skilled at using our characters, but I'm always fielding better ships and more high SP alts than you in a fight, then that's going to give me an edge. And one way to get that edge that doesn't involve in-game activity at all is to throw dollars at CCP, hence paying to increase my odds of winning.
---
You practice a losing strategy.  If you continue that way, you will never escape from being backed against the wall.  If you are not experiencing an offensive siege to your home and are only dealing with bot farmers or rabbit plexing, you only need a single person available to chase them out and focus on the attack.  
---
You'll say I don't know what i'm talking about but I have twice been part of the beginning effort to fight the Squids while they were rising from 3 to 4 in tier but never reached 5 because I have a strategy that works in this situation and because I understand the tier system and human nature.  
---
You want to gather a group of willing oplexers who won't mind for a while to be plexing in negative 50% t1 rewards for a while.  Be consistent in the theme and goal of these little fleets and you will gain a following, even if it's a few pilots that join you for less than an hour.  I named such fleets as Tier Warfare Fleet, and I began by attacking undefended upgraded systems.  You monitor the situation of your enemies tier and if you are close to knocking them down one tier, go for those few points necessary to drop them 1 or 2 points below tier.  Once you achieve this, you shift over to oplexing systems that are nearest your trade hub and farthest and most inconvenient for your enemy to reach daily to either dplex or oplex once you bash it.  You have to take player activity into consideration of course, as even some remote regions are considered home base for the enemy in some cases.  Anyhow, once you fire that psychological wound to the enemy tier, you fiercely attack every system that falls under the that category above and wait until they bump their tier back up.  Once they bump up, attack undefended systems that have their donations barely topped off.  By doing this, you increase the taxes each time someone must donate to that same hub and it will rise so quickly that it will retain less than 50% of what they are dumping into it.  Again, focus on barely bringing them 2-3 points below the next tier threshold and after, continue to attack these other systems which are easy for you to patrol, and hard for them to show attention to.  But keep in mind to never take any of these systems beyond 30% or 40%, as you want to discourage anyone from dplexing there because of the lower rewards.  Once you are able to repeat this enough to where you kill the morale of those who donate, and discourage the fat slobs that are used to high tier but have become too spoiled by it that they are unmotivated by the lesser rewards and lay back until tier comes back up to a more appealing level.  The enemy becomes complacent by this point that if you continue, you can bring them down to high tier 2, and then is the time that you push these 40% systems all up to vuln and prepare your side for a massive flip campaign.    
---
Go ahead and see if this won't work.  I've seen it and have helped do it many times.  And who am I?  I'm a nobody.  Yet I'm capable of this much when I act in small ways and in many places.

Why would people accept every major balance change that CCP throws at us?
---
They haven't had the highest success rate i.e. Wandsov, Citadel proliferation, Jump Fatigue etc.
---
And this cyno change definitely needs feedback as releasing it in its current state would be awful.
---
Goons, obviously. Haven't you heard, *every* change is a change that benefits them. Nice try killing them CCP!
---
I couldn't disagree more but honestly can't muster up the will to refute your point of view. It is yours.. I disagree with it and everything you just wrote.. Done.

Changing the fitting requirements is two simple database entries.

Restricting the module to certain ship requires adding a new flag to those ships and the module.  So actually it's more things to change.
---
So what prevented him from utilizing his OP panic mechanic to survive said driveby other than complete player incompetence.
---
The people who bought all the Falcons and relisted for 500 each clearly
---
So you had a glorious "Fight", you didn't lose your rorqs, and people lost supers saving you???  I must have missed the "glorious" part.  Considering you ween't fighting while you were in PANIC, Im curious as to how you peeveepeed at all
---
Technically on both occasions the fleet that was already on grid could have nuked the cyno of the other fleet, no?
---
Ye exactly. I mean if they were gonna hit us with such a mighty hammer then why do small nerfs. Because right now Rorqs with miners 2 are making like 40m/hour or so and after cyno changes a lot of rorqs will drop off. Now if they were making 200m/hour maybe it would be worth it.
---
So the equation is really bonkers.
---
I'm doing quite well. So far I have collected 3 jump freighters, 2 Rorquals, 17 caps and a hangar full of corpses from all the people quitting and giving me their things to "keep safe" and by "keep safe" I obviously mean YOLO nyx roller derby adventure time. On ice.

if your flair is correct and you are in test, maybe you should check your internal forums? you probably have a decent fit there. if not, take a look at what damage type sansha does and  fit your procurer to tank that

Since for every uncloaked Heron there is a 20 man Proteus gang in wormholes you just have to get the 10 Herons together.
---
You are missing something. Like being able to bridge a massive fleet to that cyno instead of jumping caps.
---
as the in cyno for goons in UALX, i can tell you that after jumping to a brick tanked T3 I instantly lit a cyno on my Wyvern to allow the rest of the fleet to jump to, yeah in theory they could kill our cyno but hard cynoing on caps is one thing that helps make these fights a reality

I accept all kinda of assets for safekeeping.

And its still exactly the same, having the option to spend hundreds of real life dollars to buy skill injectors to "catch up"  doesnt remove that perception.
---
CCP pls nerf herons
---
Because now if you'd like to suicide cyno it will cost you ~300m.
---
What you're missing is that capitals not being able to fit cynos is what a good 90% of the screaming is about.
---
take everything at butt value only
---
I kinda wish a single player mattered more
---
TIL that there is a Eve online Facebook group
---
But dude, there are is set amount of moons/region. And there is a set amount of each type of moons. That means that during a period its not infinite. Its not like mining clusters where u just wait a couple of hours for a new spawn. There is at any given moment a finite amount of moongo available.
---
This amount has regional aspects meaning people actually have to mine them in specific regions and if you havent noticed NS is rather empty meaning all that goo wont be mined. And alliances arent gonna just up and relocate because of a spike in a certain goo. 
---
No dude, the mats are used in different ships. Which means that there is a balance thing to consider. Just trust me, moongoo isnt as straightforward as you think. Regular ore, sure because thats infinite at any given time. But you cant magically conjure up more goo just because there is high demand.
---
Adapt or die moron
---
&gt; Changing the fitting requirements is two simple database entries.
---
yeah but
---
&gt;just give certain ships a bonus "reduction" in fitting cost to make it practical to use on those ships.
---
is more.
---
Capital ships should never have been allowed to be injected into.
---
Thanks for the valuable contribution to the discussion. Like I said in the post I think the nerf to super umbrellas is a good change I just think that it being limited to the two ship classes selected has adverse effects and is potentially without a good reason.
---
It’s as much work as restricting it to two hull types.  And there’s no requirement that they give out said bonuses.
---
Allowing all subcaps to light would simply make Abaddons mandatory in the SMA.
---
I appreciate the back pedal.  Can you show me some statistics demonstrating that high sec ganking has caused the game to struggle retaining new players?
---
I'd rather you not equate people who fly supercapitals to cancer, which is a real and quite grim health problem impacting millions of people around the world.
---
Your glib approach to such a serious issue is frankly appalling and entirely uncouth. I would expect better from someone who would dare call themselves a capsuleer.
---
Furthermore, to assume all of said pilot use tobacco products in the form of vaping and are therefore idiot douchebags of the highest order is also very presumptuous. They were idiot douchebags before they started to vape and they only did the rest of the world a favor by accelerating their death and flagging themselves as inappropriate additions to the gene pool. We should thank them for selecting themselves for removal and disappearing from genetic history in a puff of cotton candy flavored mist.
---
Stupid comments get stupid questions.
---
Sounds like you need a couple good blue tick hounds around the farm.
---
I mean is that going to be a problem for any of the major blocks? They are absolutely going to be willing to do that.
---
That sounds like a great opportunity for spies to light troll cynos.  I like it.
---
Sure I can still bring a cheap ass magnate and drop Titans on a loki
---
Sorry, have you checked Reddit today?

Well if we're all just Eve Trillionaires, then this game is pointless and we might as well all quit

---
Look. it's actually balanced right now. Sabres and hics can't cyno either. Only weak easily killed ships can. For the first time ever they did something right. Try to enjoy it and see that it's a good thing for everyone. Sure cynoing is risky now. The game is risk online. Enjoy it before it's high risk of just logging in and having a 5% chance of character biomass

I learned a very similar thing.

Seconds later I also concluded that I'd never want to join such a thing.

Good point. Can I have your stuff?

We bombed Bombers Bar once but it's difficult to line up a shot on stealth bombers. Goku/Stutka fleets are very bombable though.
---
?  Probably less effort to just build new ones in your home hole?
---
Also true.  This change really only means more bodies are needed to drop shit than anything.  So...  Yeah.  Major powers unaffected.
---
This one was from a true sansha dread (true being the sansha T2 variant, other factions have other names such as dark blood, instead of just blood for blood raider faction)
---
what north ? what people? shut up you.
---
Oh that could be a fun ship, I do love flying my nightmare
---
You forgot the most important part- no more cynos on ratting carriers!! 
---
:)))))
---
Grrr goons. 
---
GF pubbie.
---
I heap of assumptions
---
Yes, please tell me more of the coming meta, Mr. "Only Caps shouldn't be able to fit cynos"
---
Maybe.
---
So?  I have to have 5 accounts to play with my JF.
---
i rat in my rorqs
---
Lowsec pvp wins
---
Yeah, but sabres and HICs should be able to cyno IMO. Everyone is acting like only carebears are impacted by this change and that it universally increases the chaos and danger of Eve, but there are ways such as that this change decreases it as well.
---
no it's not.
---
restricting it to two groups means 
---
1. set the attribute "CanFitShipGroup01:833" to the cyno to allow it on the ForceReconShip
---
2. set the attribute "CanFitShipGroup02:898" to the cyno to allow it on the BlackOps group
---
and that's it. Literally 2 lines. Changing the bonus or whatever takes at least this number of modifications.
---
What? 
---
No. I would have roughly 1/3rd of the available SP I currently have, and given the minimum amount I would have had to put towards making money, I would still be stuck in maybe 1 factions worth of T2 cruisers, and probably only some of them. I would not have a T2-capable dread alt, I would not have a carrier pilot, because I wouldn't have been able to afford them without the accelerated improvement of my income stream(s) that injectors provided.
---
At the end of the day, what matters is the number of accounts you can PvP with, because those are what I use to dunk your rorqs, evict your wormhole, or fight you over a structure. If I can catch up in terms of PvP accounts, the number of useless PvE accounts you have doesn't matter.
---
All I hear is someone grouchy that other people can have capital ships and T3Cs without waiting 4 years to get there, because they lost their SP supremacy. If learning how to pilot those ships is so important, just dunk some caps and T3Cs and farm them for dank ticks all day. Unless, of course, the only reason you were "elite" at the game was that you had the T3C and the other guy was stuck in a moa.
---
Hey stop that. I'm one of those people you jerk
---
Who said that caps shouldn't be able to jump?
---
I Wonder if peoples are as agressive as on Reddit despite having they real name displayed...
---
The problem is that while it helps making these fights a reality, it also helps the umbrella and you can't change that without introducing super weird stuff like cyno fields on caps that cause self-destruct after the cycle ends.
---
You know, you could just accept that your argument is pointless. Has the same effect.
---
Bombers pose exactly the same threat as before these changes, yet your apocalypse never happened.
---
Navy osprey does a great job with 3’s and 4’s. Though just pve on weeknights and find a dead leg of .6 and .5 space.   Easy billion after a few hours and fairly easy to chain on weeknights when the login count is low. No reason to do highsec value sites in low.
---
This is so the right fit
---
Edited to be accurate, the point stands though
---
I dislike the “random 1au away” only because caps are very easy to probe and dictors could at that point easily prevent the response from ever arriving.
---
I’m fine with subs as a response but then add a module that acts like a cyno but only for bridges. Flash Forming and then Gating subs to a fight gives the attacker a tremendous amount of time and the ability to deny a response fight altogether. Any attacker worth their salt will be doing everything possible to deny the fight and prevent the subs from ever landing on grid.
---
If the response can not get to the fight then it’s not content, it’s just hisec ganking ported to nullsec and honestly that adds nothing to the game overall.
---
I think they need to add Force Recons to the list and give them a bigger cycle time bonus. They seem to have lost their original purpose because of the usability of corvettes.
---
I recently made a incursion alt and it sucks about the spawns but we don't have to contest that often. The last time we contested we won it and had 3 Hyperion new bros. I can def see them losing due to the large number of new bros. That's kind of the point of warp2me tho. Get in and get better shit to improve their fleets and skill into the better SP required groups.
---
Perhaps. If a few smaller but older groups have combat alts, it's not difficult to bridge a few into system and have them on standby. A cloaked ship doesn't require much effort to multibox. 
---
SRP wallets might start to hurt tho.
---
The fact that you don't have an issue with that is part of the problem.
---
the more legit cynos there are, the higher the probability of jumping to one. guess they're onto something
---
Do you live in a vault?

He was cleaning out an ice belt and had just finished the last rock and was warping out, if I recall correctly. There was nothing to lock onto that would have allowed him to panic. Thanks for asking.

---
I'm not arguing anything other than injectors are massive income source for CCP and that they make it easy to skirt almost any change they make. Just because you rolled in and banged out four paragraphs that didn't really say anything different than what I already said doesn't mean you shouldn't give me your stuff.
---
you are right, the same thing that lets these fights happen is the same thing that allows supers to be so safe ratting. My personal belief is that supers, titans, rorquals, dreads and fax should not be able to light cynos but carriers still can. to balance this maybe they could drastically increase the fitting requirements of the cyno so its basically a capital module (or even 2-3 in terms of cpu/PG) and give a bonus to recons/blops bs/other subcaps that reduces the fitting requirement for cynos.
---
Injectors are part of the problem. But they are also a money cow for ccp.
---
And lets be honest: if you can fly a cap and need a cyno and cant afford to fly the new 'to-go' cyno ships on one of your alts... you are doing something wrong. 
---
And at least... just spam cyno beacons in your ratting systems and your staging....
---
That's true. You'd want to have your spy start with A-something to be at the top of the list.
---
Honestly though, unless it's a huge capital battle, it wouldn't be worth burning a spy toon over.
---
You don't have to pay for a cyno alt. Just trust someone to light it for you. It's a risk, sure, but you have a fucking capital ship so there needs to be equivalent risk.
---
I fucking love the heron
---
Statis objectives, limited amount per system, important but vulnerable so you had to defend.
---
I can see why you miss them.
---
It's def possible. The only time I see warp2me not running is right before down time. The armor group is also going constantly
---
The general purpose of my post was to get more people into lowsec for them to see that it doesn't mean automatic loss of ship if you know what you are doing, to get used to it and not fear and leave hisec to newbies and afk orcas. You can chain run hisec anoms in anything, but if you do get escalations in low, don't just write them off as not doable. Just my .02isk
---
Caps dont have that great of application. They have had during different periods but honestly, sit in one on SISI if you dont have one on TQ and try to hit an alt. Youll quickly realise they really arent what people say they are. Sure if youre standing still they will hurt but if you got a decent comp with logi you can easily outrep their damage. 
---
The reason they are used as that is because its simply not fun or efficient to ping for fleets everytime a small gang decides they wanna have fun. Imagine yourself sitting in staging, getting a ping for a subcap comp, an FC is needed, you have to get there and then the gang just goes back into the WH. Imagine doing that 10-20 times/day. When do you think there will be time to do anything else? 
---
People are complaining about shit being stagnant now but how do you think this will play out? People dont have infinite amount of time meaning alliances dont have an infinite amount of manhours. If most of that is spent at home then wars will stop completely. Thats what happened during the drifter invasion, everyone just turtled up cause there were several hundred attacks/day requiring responses.
---
Its simply much more efficient to drop some caps and watch the people that were never gonna take a fight they could lose just moonwalk away. Its not because theyre OP, its simply because most realise that the party is over when theyre on grid.
---
It was never about those things. Think one step ahead as I explaned above. You think shit is stagnant now? Thats the complaint right? Wait till after the changes. Then people are gonna complain again about shit being stagnant and want further nerfs. And shits gonna become even more stagnant. Its a vicious cycle which is why good game design doesnt subtract, it adds. And good game design understands that certain things cant be balanced, like small gang vs big gang. Right now theyve broken big gang but that means big gang vs big gang also gets fked. The majority of PvP in eve is gonna become more scarce, just so small gangs can get some easy frags.
---
Thats not good game design. Good game design would have been allowing for small gang to fight vs small gang and let big gang fight big gang. Everyone wins.
---
If you have rorqs out in "rural" nullsec, you should kinda have HAW Dreads or something other at hand, too, in your rural nullsec.
---
I mean I don't really see what the point was. Why would the big blocks be unwilling to sacrifice 300+ million cyno ships to save supers worth billions?
---
Completely agree. I may have skimmed over the spirit of your post.  +1

---
r/EVE
---
No, because in Null there's plenty of places you can get away from the super balls thanks to the spread out geography. In lowsec, huge swathes of the place are covered by and controlled by 1-2 groups.
---
Compound that with the shitty rewards of living in lowsec and you have a high risk, low reward place that should be a medium risk, medium reward area.
---
CCP is changing the game to monetize it better and hoping people will hang around long enough to get microtransactioned to hell and back.
---
Because their whiney shitheads and it's an easy T2 Cruiser kill for roaming gangs. How many 300m ships are you willing to toss away?
---
&gt; because most of the fair fights in the game happen when one side intercepts another at a gate.
---
Which is exactly why I travel via covops bridge. This is Eve. If you're caught in a fair fight you both fucked up.
---
&gt;So who will win the most from the new changes again?
---
Cloaked hunters.
---
I mean that exact thing is still going to happen just with a tankier ship that you have even less chance of killing in time. If your Lokis can't kill a magnate before the titans come through they sure as hell won't kill a Recon or Blops.
---
no, rate of fire doesn't round up in practice  
---
1 server tick=1 second is a principle for align time only, and even these can be beaten by lock times with a smaller fraction  
---
over 100 seconds, the former will have fired 50 times whereas the latter 49, on the 101th second the server will update to register the 50th volley while the 1.99s gun starts its 51st
---
DELETE NULLSEC!
---
pretty sure after these changes some people want a hangar full of Falcons corpses :P
---
I can't agree that either of them should have cyno and i dont even krab. This is a very well balanced change as is. Adding cyno to these two classes just makes pvp more safe and it should be hard and very high risk too. I don't like this game being easy for anyone. Changes should balance. Not benefit one side while screwing the other. 
---
This change fucks everyone equally and that is truly impressive in my eyes
---
If you think that, then you are not a wormholer!!!
---
Wormholer btw.
---
I'm sure a Rev *could* work it's just that Naglfar has the advantage of having a turret-based weapon system (no delayed damage issue) along with guns that don't require capacitor, so the Naglfar is a lot more open when it comes to capacitor. And dreadnoughts---all of them---are STARVED for capacitor.
---
If it isn't part of the pvp player hivemind, it's probably downvoted, memed on and then any further attempt to say something that isn't part of that is so thoroughly polluted by shitposting... it's a wonder PVE players still try. 
---
Anyway

**Chaos for all or content for none, choose one** and stop screwing over the little guy with your updates.

Yes, that cruiser is a fun beast to fly around.

---
I'm not sure yet how it will hold on against Triglavians... Those fellas are mad angry :(
---
Rural NS shouldn't be using Rorqs if they can't protect them. There's nothing wrong with that.
---
Just to be clear though it's true that there are plenty of other people out there definitely break up
---
I know dedication is hard to spot when you're used to meme posting, but do try a little.
---
Right, okay. Yeah go ahead and travel back in time and sit in an orca in a coalition's sovnull for hours and you'll be fine as well. Only you'll end up earning more than in highsec. Better do it with a rorq though; that was essentially the meta up until recently.
---
most c5 groups build their own caps and then haul in the fitting
---
are bait rorq real rorqs until something bites?
---
The too-safe-already JF pilots
---
Wasnt this in CCPs plan since after scrapping station walking?
---
I meant you could rep while being attacked, preventing reinforcement, as well as negating DPS when it came out of reinforcement.
---
I have Remote Capital Hull Repair 5 trained, because doing the 1% repair of defenses in a battleship was painful.
---
I mean I guess after all this time of people saying that you can't balance the game through cost I am surprised to see people clamoring about how well balancing through the cost of a T2 cruiser is going to work.
---
I had a good chuckle about rural nullsec and feral recons, have an upvote friendo
---
That's pretty much what I'm saying.  I've been around for 10 years and I can split my eve friend groups into a first and a second because so many quit when that came out.
---
Hahahaha he thinks wormholes would get invaded and not the other way round :)))
---
Dont let my secret out!
---
Oh that makes sense, Ive seen videos of revs ratting so I thought they were standard, apparantly naglfars are, thanks for your insight :)
---
You can look, but you can't touch.
---
*Nullsec has always been safe provided you knew what you were doing, if  you responded appropriately you were pretty safe. Anyone who tries to  tell you otherwise is lying to themselves.*
---
You're right. But that can be said about any part of space, high &amp; low sec as well as j-space.
---
*Maybe you should embrace the change and not fight it that people still  have an interest in EVE instead of trying to control the narrative?  Don't fight it, EVE is currently a slow-mo car crash in progress.*
---
Agreed. 'Cause, I mean what can else can You do than adapt. I love this game so I suck it up and try to get along the best way possible.
---
Still I think instead of directly adressing the issues EVE has, CCP is throwing nuclear bombs limiting playstyles and player options as collateral damage.
---
Jump Freighters were introduced in 2007, and cynos had already been ingame since 2005 (I think, 2005 is when dreads became a thing).
---
"Now that their AFK money is gone"
---
Oh noes no more 5 mil vni ticks, whatever shall the people do
---
It might be my fault but I think you missed the point of post and the example of the drop. I didnt say I was pvping I was in a mining rorq but that kind of escalation and drop doesnt happen anymore. The feeling of almost losing your rorq doesnt happen unless your completly unprepared. You drop on a ship they pop a cyno and the blob comes in and you run away. The game isnt about the skill of hunting and killing anymore or even surviving the drop. It's about what alliance your in and if you can follow the instructions that have been dumbed down to make it near impossible to screw up a save under your umbrella. Hunting is now a matter of guessing and hoping that the ship your dropping isnt paying attention or isnt prepared by following directions. What actually happened during the drop doesnt matter it's the direction that the game has gone prevents that kind of fight from happening.
---
so you're saying Prom was right and everyone just SDs their 10B apostles when they get rolled out? :eyes:
---
You may be underestimating the average Eve player’s autism, friend.
---
This is just a gun politics meme isn't it
---
I guess its time for a lowsec gate to stain or something
---
Yeah they're the fastest. fwiw, all but the Falcon get to a 4s align w/three agility mods (this includes the Enforcer). That's as agile as they can be made.
---
Maybe the Pilgrim might be preferable to Rapier and Arazu, what with it trading a mid for another utility low (nice for an overdrive or nano). I haven't checked in Pyfa. Only need three webs, after all.

One does not simply do anything in Eve
---
Triglavian abyssal sites has 1v1's.
---
&gt;Is it really a problem if the only way to gain a nullified cyno is to sacrifice skill points?  I mean, I know you could just have alts with subsystem skills at 1, but that's a pretty heavy training investment for a t3c toon that can't actually use one.
---
Man-go-not
---
Mangonaughts sounds like a pretty cool ally or Corp name.

So what I'm hearing you say is that cyno ships shouldn't be able to receive remote reps.. kind of like hics :P

Yep. And that's incredibly stupid for a game like eve. You need to analyze the long term impacts. Eve is a long term game

I have no idea what I just read.

The Royal College of Physicians, after many studies and meta studies, has concluded that vaping is 95%+ less harmful than smoking. So sorry to say, no one is really going to be dying from vaping any time soon.
---
I mean affecting both sides equally assumes that the game is already balanced for both sides. If the game is unbalanced and you only ever make changes that affect both sides of an issue equally you only maintain the unbalanced status quo.  Additionally, I would argue that lighting a cyno on a HIC or dictor has a serious trade-off already as it eliminates them being able to move entirely which is fairly important for both of them.
---
No thanks, that would break wormholes exponentially...
---
It's what people who cant hold onto sov call people who can
---
Basically NaCl
---
Agreed, skill injectors drastically changed the game, for the worse, but what can we do about it now?
---
Personally, as a ns player, the biggest thing I have to worry about when roaming with a fleet is an alliance cap umbrella. The recent changes to cynos are a huge change and imo for the better. If everyone who can drop caps lose their ability to cyno easily, bam, huge change, let's see what happens.
---
Exactly. I don't understand it myself.
---
Very much this. CCP had worked up tons of goodwill within the community. Honestly, before the blackout I was the guy who always pissed everyone off by saying, "its cool, CCP will fix it, just give them time". When the blackout hit, or perhaps during the drifter thing, I started to realise that this is just punitive. Then came the podcast and it was truly awful, so filled with bile and hatred towards people in NS.
---
And nowhere along the line was there anything resembling taking responsibility for the shit were in. It was, "these ultrasafe risk averse krabbers arent gonna make risk free isk under umbrellas anymore". I was genuinly shocked. Like why the fuck is the leadership taking sides? I mean we are all your costumers and you have chosen to piss of the majority just because you like the other side more? It was super childish and my goodwill towards them was gone.
---
And goodwill is like trust, takes years and years to form and can be burned in a couple of minutes. And CCP is by far not the first or the last company that have lost goodwill due to arrogance and hubris. But in general, companys are very careful about what they say and how simply because they know the potential outcome. Just look at gilette and their ad that cost them what, 8b? Simply because they were arrogant and thought they could get away with it.
---
But as you say, one needs to not just react but instead give it some time. I doubt the changes will work and I dont think they will iterate fast enough but Im giving them some more time. After that, I mean, there are other babies:)
---
But the assumption that we should just take it because of what CCP did wrong in the past is very wtf. Like I somehow owe CCP anything. Or the small gangs. Like wtf, maximum levels of entitlement. Im supposed to just not have fun for a year because CCP refused to fix the rorqual. And just let my ships explode because small gangs got dunked. Whilst still paying for the game. Like loooooool.
---
NPC systems in Drone Regions and any other region that doesn't have them, tia.
---
But how small can the game get before incoming money no longer equals the server and staff costs? You can only fire so many people to keep the company in the green before you don't have enough people to even maintain the servers let alone create new content.

no surprise here
---
Just let this game die already.
---
I mean no prop mod nothing but tank, sure. And then what does it do? Dies In 3 seconds rather than 2
---
I think the management of the long term impacts have been from fallout over long standing empires having a fit when changes happen.  One of the benefits of not being directly beholding to non gaming studio investors is that this is no longer such a concern.  The man said 16k of people a week are trying eve, The disgruntled cap crowd has to be 5000, 6000 toons tops, and half of those are regular long term subs.  If a long term restructure allows for a large amount of development after the fallout settles, thats pretty solid long term thinking to me.
---
As easy as the gank-and-escape tactic of lighting a cyno and dropping your super on everything?
---
So rape dreads insurance cost. Whelping a capital shouldn't be something you consider willy nilly

&gt;These changes have been asked for by players in all space.
---
Changes to cynos have been requested, with plenty of good suggestions thrown out there.  These changes in particular, not so much.
---
More importantly, are there any left to be sold?
---
They don't take very long to manufacture, so any run wouldn't be long-lasting.

yeah but that implies that ppl just devolve into mindless ship spinners under an umbrella, and why do ppl need "hate boners"(hilarious) in order to fight. Its stale because we are drones that need to be pushed instead of thinking like agents with their own self control. Step into the rain.
---
&gt;Nobody said anything about cloak. Im fine either way.
---
Then why are you bitching at me.
---
&gt;Cute for you to assume i am rooting for one sided change though.
---
You're so against what I'm saying, it was obvious.
---
&gt;You are a sob fucktard.
---
What does that even mean. Use your words. 
---
&gt;I hope you keep on playing this game that makes you miserable.
---
It doesn't make me miserable.. else I wouldn't play it?
---
&gt;It is fun to watch you retards reeeeeee all the time. Byeee
---
Says the guy reeeing at me and saying "the game is not for you" etc. Looks like you haven't trained IQ II, III, IV or V. Come back when you have.
---
I have no idea what you are trying to say. Try punctuation, paragraphs, or english if the problem persists.
---
Basically, in ye good olden times, there was more variety on the sovereignity map. There were more neutral alliances living closer together, meaning constant skirmishes, big and small.
---
Eventually, groups started making more and more Non-Aggression Pacts (NAP), with "the north" being particularly famous for this. The rest of null followed soon after and we ended up with where we are now. Pre-arranged bullshit, massive zergs that don't do a goddamn thing and no need for actually conquering territory because every system can entertain everyone now.
---
Fuck it, I'll bite.  I googled it.  Guess what I found out?  You're wrong, according to CCP Rise.

"We have tried and tried to validate the myth that griefing has a pronounced affect on new players - we have failed. The strongest indicators for a new player staying with EVE are associated with social activity: joining corps, using market and contract systems, pvping, etc. Isolating players away from the actual sandbox seems very contrary to what we would like to accomplish."

Happy to take that apology for calling me a lazy fuck whenever you're ready.
---
You asked the question you complete idiot.
---
This makes too much sense, downvotes incoming.
---
Well a prop mod does jack shit when your cyno is up, and if its not up, you'll be cloaked at a tac anyways.
---
That’s what I do, I can’t speak for others, but it certainly is quicker to scan and blow them up than to blindly hack
---
&gt;I'd love to see your list of meaningful changes that can't be averted with injectors.
---
Well you're asking the wrong guy then. I'm not claiming people won't adapt their playstyles in response to a change like this, injectors or not. Also, despite plenty of opportunity, I have yet to see anyone inject Drakes back into being popular again. Or for that matter make the Widow cool again(?). 
---
&gt;I'm not being snarky I'd actually be curious what you can't just get around with  injectors because I can't think of anything specific.
---
Well for one, you can't undo mechanical changes. You cannot inject fozzieclaws back into the nullified cancer they once were. Secondly, they don't actually improve ship abilities beyond the normal V levels anyone can get normally. Lastly, most people only ever assume one side will have the unlimited resources to draw from and design a scenario for failure.
---
I had this issue when I first started too. I learned to just train for the ships that I wanted to fly and just ignoring training doctrines that change every year.
---
Been loving these videos, really hope you keep making them! The best part is with these I can now teach all my students about EVE online while pretending to teach them about inflation and deflation.
---
I mean during that period they did hire [someone from EA](https://www.ccpgames.com/news/2015/maria-sayans-joins-ccp-as-chief-customer-officer/).
---
If that's true why the fuck were war decs in HS nerfed?  He's talking complete bollocks.
---
Welcome to cloaks online.
---
It's never a bad time to start.
---
hey mr. slippery slope, the changes haven't happened yet.
---
See, 3 on 3 frigate fights in abyssals would be incredible. Very much welcome  to that change ASAP. 
---
Thanks for assuming I downvoted you, bitch.
---
To me the Corax will always be 2 kestrels, duct taped together, except one of the engines doesnt work. Great looking ship, but unless you are swatting frigs it can't do much, and even other ships do that better now.
---
So now CCP Rise doesn't know what he's talking about, but some rando on reddit who throws insults instead of evidence is right?  
---
And there's a difference between war decs and ganking.  CCP showed that war decs killed activity.  They could NOT make the same correlation with ganking.  In fact, ganking led to a INCREASE in player retention.  Weird, I know - experiencing PvP in a PvP game keeps people engaged. 
---
I'm still willing to accept your apology.  You don't even have to take back the "lazy fuck" part.  Just admit you don't know what you're talking about.
---
Yea, getting the same error
---
Ok listen let's stop.with all the friends BS.  The simple fact is if I had no friends or I was a solo player or In fact I was the only person playing eve.  The simple fact is that I would not be able to jump my capital ship without having a second account. That's the facts and the mechanics of the game.  Therefore if you wanted to jump your ship then you as a player would need to.have a second account. That's utter BS.   Forget having friends its not relevant.
---
Specifically a :lolus: one, that doesn't apply the rest of the world's firearms owners.
---
&gt;I'm looking to get heavily into an MMO - get home from work and play until the wee hours of the night.
---
I feel like this should actually be some misfortune that befalls someone and not something they actively seek out.
---
I agree with the last statement for sure. 
---
For the flash sub fleet could you not just cyno them to local system for formup and warp from there? I only meant gating if staging is only a couple jumps for defenders. 
---
Maybe if the 1AU caps landed with temp cloak like gate it would be more manageable without getting caught? Like I said, I don’t want to stop them altogether, just create a delay or window between them jumping and arriving on grid. 
---
-Where that delay can be altogether removed if you effectively contest the grid with a fleet.
---
Well, CCP doesnt give a shit about the customer. Only job ever where the customer is WRONG!
---
This whole comment is a shit ton of projection.
---
&gt;Incursions are ment to be end game pve content alphas should not be doing them
---
Sandbox. aDaPT
---
&gt;and incursion communities keep track of player activity to get players to upgrade ships and weapons to tech 2, I think you are a sponge looking to just get low effort isk
---
?? I'm not an alpha, and I have T2 skills for multiple incursion ships.
---
I sympathize with alphas, because I was once a kid with no money burning through 7/14 day Eve trials. I'd have loved the ability to play as an alpha can now. I also understand not everyone has the money to buy Plex or omega time constantly.
---
Take your head out of your ass.
---
I would wait a couple months before you actually pay any money. The game has reached a critical point where it's broken beyond repair and the people in charge are burning it down as a last ditch effort to save it. 
---
Play as an alpha and get the hang of it I'd say. But you may be wasting your money paying for a game that could be on its death bed.
---
Fuck, having injectors scale depending on the skill injected would actually fulfill the basic stated goal of injectors, which is to get newbros up to speed faster, better than the current implementation.
---
Firewalling is a thing.
---
Most people don't stick to anything for 10 years in their life, regardless of video game balance.
---
I would just like to point out a clear fact. If ANYONE in this community made a post about limiting cynos to 4 ships, they would have been downvoted, trolled, laughed at, ridiculed, and insulted over and over until they left in shame for trying to make a suggestion to better the game. 
---
Hey, but when CCP makes the announcement y'all accept it and, love it, and praise them. If someone disagrees, you say "embrace the change" or the classic... adapt or die. 
---
Strange... FYI, I love the changes. I want more of it.
---
Someone has to...
---
Eve isn't a game you play after work until the wee hours of the night. Eve is a game you play over the course of a decade.
---
Sure you play moment to moment, but everything you do today matters for the rest of your EVE career.
---
Anything you accomplish in WoW will mean nothing in 2 years. The whole game gets reset on a constant basis. Not so for EVE. You can put the game down for 2 years, and come back still relevant.
---
I find as I get older I come back to EvE more and more. I like the punishing difficulty. I like that your own knowledge of the game is far more important that the items you posses. I can't play other MMOs anymore, because they feel too childish.
---
Just be prepared for how incredibly boring the moment to moment gameplay is.
---
There's a real threat that Eve will be going away? Didn't Invasion just launch? What did they do wrong
---
Oh, I would so rock the Pony Avatar skin.  
---
Maybe with animation/movement of the actual Little Pony.  Take my money CCP.
---
Video didn’t link
---
I support the suggested injector rework concept, though I would go small/medium/large instead of T1/T2.  Frigates and small weapon systems (even skilled to V) should be cheapest.  I would buy a bunch of injectors if this changed.
---
I don’t think you understand just how much money the big alliances have.  They could afford to srp dreads with 0 insurance.
---
OTOH, the folks targeted with this “make Marauders cheap dreads” idea aren’t quite so well off.
---
Spool up was one of many good ideas suggested by the community for balancing cynos.  What CCP chose was quite simply not one of the good ideas.
---
Unrated comment. There is a reason hounds are the faithful companions of farmers. They are effective.

But is it a *good* time?

Nothing they really did wrong, but years of leaving broken mechanics while they have been smoking the meth pipe. Now they're back and trying to save the best game ever created by tinkering with things that didnt go well the last time they played with them.
---
And following in the line of trade-offs, there is supposed to be counterplay.  Hamstringing players into only fitting cynos to one type of ship makes limits counterplay.
---
And I very much agree that it destroys playstyles instead of balancing them.
---
What mean? Real name?

From the massive rivers of tears we have seen in this subreddit since the changes were announced, I'm tempted to say World of Warcraft.

It's all the little shit that's accumulated over the years. The developers are now making some drastic changes with the hopes of turning it around (No "local" channel (each solar system in the game has a channel that shows you who's in the same system), changes to how capital ships move around, NPCs attacking everything and everyone)
---
Sure, dude.
---
yes but they also redid Trig Invasion hitting agency systems and camping SOA routes xD
---
Just pull the plug already. Only then the chaos will be complete.
---
I couldn't agree more with this.
---
What’s SOA?
---
Remember, the EVE is dying trope has been ongoing for the past 10+ years. If you want to start, start.
---
You'd only have to know the sub/omega numbers and total revenue to figure that out.
---
That should be possible to get?
---
&gt;Why not: You light a Cyno, EVERYONE can jump to it?
---
This guy is a genius!!!  or at least kind of smart - it is an interesting idea.
---
Not really.  CCP is doing Age of Chaos or some such, the rules are in flux.  It looks like if you stay in hisec, it's pretty consistent so far... but who knows.
---
Go Alpha try it out. EvE is a bit special alright. 2Cents its worth it, I'm having a blast as a newbean.
---
How do feral force recons get into hostile space these days? Bomber lights covert, then recon jump to covert and light reg cyno?
---
2003 player, part time mostly. 110m sp, all in PVP, and 500m in my wallet, and about 12b net worth i think. I've been unsubbed because other games provide easyer aces to pvp.

But I have a problem, i'll never quit this game. I've done a bit of everything, but Being an FC is by far the most fun I have playing. Never used a single injector, and I fly with +2 implants if any at all. 
---
Fuck SP, fuck ISK, Fuck brainlessly following meta.
---
I'm going to Alpha it up in lowsec with T2 fit basic frigs, and no more than 10m in implants and or boosters. I was tired of taking orders from kids with power in null sec alliances. 
---
Play eve how you want, Don't follow the meta and welp everything. Don't look back, and give more people the finger. Find new groups when you need a change, or things become a shitshow.

... in before new module increasing AC ammo capabilities by 2-300%. It comes with a rabid southerner yelling about the second amendment, "mah rights" and "the gummint". Possibly also "muslins" or "wetbacks" or something.

---
Whaling isn't really my content, I go on BB once a month maybe but honestly I prefer small gang fights and fleet brawls. What I want is some level of balance between effort to keep whales safe and effort to hunt and kill them, which reflects their incredibly high ISK/hr income.
---
Suppose this recon of yours travels by teleportation
---
&gt; For the flash sub fleet could you not just cyno them to local system for formup and warp from there? I only meant gating if staging is only a couple jumps for defenders.
---
Maybe? The issues still come down to bubbles denying the response. I could see it working but honestly it feels too RNG for me. That’s why I suggested being able to bridge but not jump directly into the grid.
---
As far as the last point, if you have to run subs in to control the field first, that’s already a delay. I get that you mean additional delays and that you agree about buffing HP in concert to prolong the fight but it’s still going to be very easy for attackers to just dip out of the fight at the moment a response shows up. Subs are unlikely to even be able to catch any of the attackers to fight unless the attackers think they can control the field.
---
I’m not sure how to fix that, but that’s an issue with delaying the response that is going to be harder to deal with.
---
Actually this is an oversimplification. As of right now, a dude out and about in his own faction's space while not in a dead space pocket and in fleet with the standing fleet can light a cyno if in duress and summon forth amble logo and fire support in the form of FAXes, carriers dreads and supers. As of the change in Sept, you need a second pilot standing by ready to light a cyno to do the same. This means that every rather in your standing fleet is going to have to take up an additional slot in your fleet so they can use their multiboxed alt to light their own rescue cyno and still be able to broadcast for reps. However, since attackers have no aversion to hunting in a force recon, it means attackers only need one pilot to attacker same said rather. Basically, CCP is forcing people to multibox even more because more accounts = more $$$
---
you can even check dotlan overall stats for august nullsec stats don't lie, since its the 15th/16th just double the stats and see the difference to the last 5 years but hey more ships got killed? NOPE half of them got killed and dont let me start on the pve aspect. Only active regions are Test, Goons, Horde/NC.
---
I can see what you’re saying about fleets moonwalking away from your caps, and if you actually formed a sub fleet that could be frustrating. 
---
Have you ever tried scanning down the wormhole and bubbling it? That would probably surprise most wormholers because currently the extreme majority of nullsec doesn’t even begin understand how wormhole entrances work. If you don’t know that then you won’t ever be able to counter it. So then it comes down to balancing or needing something because one player group hasn’t bothered to learn the mechanics of the space the hostile group lives in.
---
If you bubble the hole while some wormholers are shooting your cap or Rorq and then warp or cyno a sub fleet into them, you’re going to catch the majority of them.
---
Null has been stagnant for years. For a several years our group would do a yolo T1 fleet through null. At least 60% of them time we would run into a cyno with titans or supers. The other 35% we would find nothing but docked bots. 5% we would run into some brave space and get a 150 man response fleet. The caps wouldn’t even get more than 1-2 kills on us but it killed the content because after years we slowly stopped even bothering to go there. That was all pre-blackout. Can’t get a whole lot worse than that honestly, there was nothing out there to begin with worth shooting.
---
One of our favorite past-times is watching nullseccers get lost or rolled in wormholes. It’s great fun.
---
Full story is in the desc of the youtube video. Video is laggy because i couldn’t fix obs when fighint
---
We are like that in Alaska too.
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
such a retard boi
---
Falcon would lose more hair when he would have any left while he tries to spin PCU out of the August hit due to blackout same for Dotlan Stats, and hilmar will shit his pants when the koreans call him for the part of the contract where its stated perfomance xD,. And when the cyno also deactivate sub accounts, reduce PCU faster and spin a hole in the economics of production which is mostly based in nullsec maybe the downward spiral gets a speedbuff.
---
Not for the reward of catching one. It should be risky/hard for such a large reward. It's well balanced with the advantage of blackout offers for finding one now
---
People used to be more willing to fight. But then people realized that you can do PVE more easily to make ISK if you aren't constantly fighting with everyone so made arrangements to not fight anyone. 
---
At this point trying to throw a wrench into the gears that drive the larger empires is a futile endeavour as it will be cleared instantly by capital ships. The only thing that can take down the large empires at this point with all the momentum they have is another large empire. And the large empires have scrambled hard to ensure their survival by making arrangements with the others to not fight like that.
---
Yeah but ya'll dealing with 30-50 feral polar bears charging the yards your kids are playing with.
---
That would be cool. They'd have to be absolutely massive holes so people feel comfortable seeding caps through them though.

The first "EvE is dying~" post is from 2003, the same year it was released. I have played since 2007, and have never had a better time playing eve than the last two years. It's never too late to start, and at least you can play for free as an alpha to see if you wanna drop money on the sub
---
Why do people keep claiming this is an unpopular opinion? Do you have a victim complex. By your own words you are the one attacking people of a different opinion, and the sting upvotes echo chamber just proves my point.
---
Here's the thing: do you still like Eve? Enjoy it. Don't like where it is going? Quit. Let the chips fall where they may, but this tired rhetoric of trying to shame people into continuing to play is getting stale fast. I'm only seeing one side of this debate acting like a bunch of rabid monkeys, and it's not the one in unsubbing and leaving the subreddit.
---
ask the new player's which do soa arc and leave the game cause this utter bullshit kills their experience when they learn what dscan or overview is lol.
---
&gt;There's a real threat that Eve will be going away?
---
No more than usual.  Eve has been dying since 2003, and any controversial change riles up the drama queens.
---
If you are in a dead end system, faction neut fit domis, a interceptor or 2, a heavy tanked af with webs, and a heavy interdictor.
---
When they come in, bubble the shit out of the other side of the gate and put domis on gate with sentries out, tracking mods on, assisting the tacklers.  If they light cyno just deagress and jump thru, if not, light them up.
---
Compare the EVE map it to a map of Europe from 1000 AD to a map of Europe today  
---
 In the beginning, there were lots of small feudal kingdoms that were constantly at war with their neighbors. Eventually, these small kingdoms banded together and formed countries. Now instead of fighting with their neighbors they joined forces with their neighbors and fought the people from the next country over. Eventually, these countries banded together and formed the European Union in order to compete with other global economic superpowers (Major Null Blocs).   
---
Now because everyone is so interconnected and organized there are much fewer wars as most things are worked out by diplomats before fights ever break out. When fights do break out it is usually with people on the other side of the world and requires a long travel time to get there. While this is great for the real world it is less than ideal for EVE as people want to have lots of wars and fun fights.   
---
Big groups pick on little groups for the same reason that big countries pick on little countries. It's simply because they can. A global superpower (major null bloc) is going to go kick the shit out of a little country (small 10 person corp) and take their resources because they can. The small group has something the large group wants and the large group knows that there is not much the small group can do about it (outside of guerilla warfare which is mostly just a nuisance).   
---
This is also why it is so hard today for a small group to grow into a large group. First of all, why would anyone join your little group that might not survive when they can join a big group with a long track record of success? Second of all, you need to keep a very good balance where you have enough resources to grow, but not too many resources which will attract a bigger groups attention who will then come and take it away from you. Small groups are late to the party and it is a very steep hill to catch up.
---
Nothing is changing much, except that you need now alt in tanked recon ready, with ability to reship if needed in the same system &lt;- **in terms of PVE**            
---
This change is killing :             
---
* moving hunting supers ^(you did this quietly by self destructing frigates as you moved - you light a cyno 5s before self destruct ... good luck with 500mil ship each time)      
---
* capital fights ^(killing cyno ship will prevent enemy reinforcements, if you are at home you can reship, enemy don't)           
---
* dread bombing ratting supers ^(well ok not totally, but extracting will cost you recon almost each time)           
---
* small scale capital usage ^(forget about moving this one capital you have ... it is just to costly now)             
---
* baiting ... recon = capital cyno .... but other stuff will not light it.    ^(while you can argue if this is good or bad - if you see a recon at any point in the system on intell chanell you know that someone is trying to bait you, including this ratting supers)             
---
This change is bad, like really bad.

---
You from downtown Juneau or Anchorage or something?
---
It shouldn't really be viable anywhere if the game is in a healthy state.

dont ask questions about Wormhole changes to make them actually dangerous as its sold on reddit. Don't talk about evictions etc. you just get downvoted by those who cried the loudest that they nano nullified gangs got dropped by titans xD.
---
but trust me you hear it my wh friends, you will be the next target after NS.
---
Yes, and ever since citadels came out, living in a wormhole has become easier.
---
I love tradewars!
---
Looking at the volume bars, they're still selling in substantially greater quantities than they were before.
---
What this actually shows is producers adjusting to supply more.
---
Dont be so sure about the reset part. 
---
Remember, C H A O S
---
and thats one of the main aspect new players won't stick to the game even korea/chinese grind games give better experience in grinding than eve pve does. And as PVP player i can sadly say that the majiority of mmo players want pve experience which eve was bad to deliver anyway.
---
... wait, there's non-poors in Alaska? Since when?
---
Great change, love it!
---
It is an interesting notion. I do like the thought of extended fights and slow escalation. I can see some of the frustration if the attacker just warps off once the caps hit Dscan. I guess I could be a bit overly optimistic that the attackers would be tackled or bubbled by the response subcaps to begin with.
---
The best option I can think of would be having dictors cyno in first and either bubble the fleet or bubble their outgates or wormhole while response subs attempt to tackle. Keep in mind the instant your defense subs force the enemy to range you can kill their cyno inhib or bubbles etc. which mean now your caps could jump in and grab tackle or mop up. lots of balancing work and number tinkering would have to go into something like this that has counterplay for both sides. I think our discussion has been fairly nice though considering the extreme back and forth throughout the rest of reddit/eve.

I think you will maybe want to skip this.  
---
I don't think Eve should even be thought of as a MMO anymore, and it certainly could not have less  in common with WoW if WoW was a brand of soap.
---
I think you’re not thinking about this hard enough. You need to have the entire recon fleet be made of spies, have about 75% actually with the fleet, and 25% at your bait. All 25% light their cynos, and have only a few on the legit fleet side light theres. Keeps suspicion off the legit in-fleet recons and makes the cyno list look legit.
---
I agree.  
---
They are doing absolutely nothing to meaningfully improve new player retention.  
---
All the recent changes are made to either pisses off or excited veteran players.  It has almost nothing to do with the 99% of people that do not make it past 30 days.  Eve has always been like this, but it makes it very vulnerable to pissing off people that made it to actually playing our game.  
---
No one is going to replace them when they are gone if things do not change.  
---
Most of these new players could give a crap about NS.  They just want to find fun things to do in game and get on boarded in a way that does not make them run away.  They never get a chance to find enjoyable things in the game because CCP has really not cared.  If it was not for a few of the NS new player friendly groups and Eve Uni it would be much much much worse.  
---
What CCP should be spending its energy doing, before picking a fight with the player base who actually log into the game, is to rebuild and improve on boarding new players.
---
no need for such large charges I'd say, otherwise non-afk cloaking would also be penalized. cov ops frigs and hulls like the stratios could only hold so many (even less if fits require additonal charges for say a cap booster) and it would really discourage long-distance hunting and surveillance. 
---
Cap 200s or maybe 400 are more appropriately sized in my opinion, and while still being able to hold a fairly large amount people wouldn't be able to sit in system all day afk cloaked or any of that nonsense, as they'd still have a limited amount and either have to resupply or run a fuel truck.
---
you'd need charges but can still be out doing cloaked operations, but sit cloaked afk all day and surely those charges will run out and youll decloak and die an afk death fitting for a cloaky camper.

Oh i forgot to add . I remember ccp nerfing bombers with align time because CVA bombers were too good at killing battleships with bombs way to easily . So that after a bombing run the ships are vulnerable . HERE WE ARE AT BOMBERS ONLINE. where each bloc has 200 bombers and mjd around they dont even have to align because the FC aligns them out as well and blink . Now if your FC is good enough bombers you can kill supers/ captials, battleships , cruisers ( T1 and T2) and frigates . The have really low mass so they can pass through pretty much a medium wormhole. The problem is not bombers its Microjump field generators which allows you to double or triple jump . this should be more of a hotfix than a balance. ANY MICRO JUMP FIELD GENERATOR MODULE/SHIP  WHICH IS AFFECTED BY A MICRO JUMP SHARES THE SAME COOL DOWN AS THE SHIP FROM WHICH IT TOOK THE FIRST JUMP FROM.  there are work arounds this for smaller groups . l
---
Skill point loss is fine for t3Cs. They're already some of the most used ships, and removing SP loss would make them overpowered.
---
hey wannabe elites are pvper in most games nowadays those guys who dont engage pvp raids in their small 5man group and excel and know when to dip out. they are those 5 dudes who want to win vs the enemy raid and still standing while all the others are dead thats your leet smallgang pvp. there where already targets enough for them before the changes but they want to 5man supers and rorqus thats their issue :P the big titan kill they want as 5 man gang.
---
In bux we fux
---
PSA: 90% of posts in your thread will be from people who haven't played EVE in at least 5 years
---
Some minor changes just to show that they care would have been enough. Making the elite frigs warp to zero on the player with a full tackle kit instead of pointless ewar. Chance at random good loot from enemies with adapted equipment/loot from rare spawn. Random interdiction escalations that caught your ship midwarp and forced you to fight off a pirate ambushed of diamond rats tuned to your ship.
---
easy as nano gangs through wormhole which are nullified right? both are easy and both counter each other seems like balanced.
---
It's like CCP was fixing gunshot wounds with kiddie bandages. But not kiddie bandages because with them you at least have a general idea what helps.
---
Shit I run mostly solo and I live on scraps compared to what these guys pump out in an hour. It's absurd. I say good riddance.
---
Yes. But that will pretty much always be the case.
---
Goons alone are 30k chars. I think at least 6k rl people. Not counting ~valued allies~. Now add estimate for legacy and ncpl/h
---
I have 15 accounts with cyno 5, recon, blackops battleship, t3 cruisers, prospects, etc.
---
Probably shock, I have about 94 hours and am still mesmerized by all the shit that one can do in this game
---
Since rotational work. Where have you been for the last 70 years?
---
&gt;Have big blocs picked on smaller groups at random, or in self defense?
---
Not to any extraordinary amount.  
---
&gt;What constitutes "the little guy" in EVE? 
---
My organization is the little guy.  Anyone bigger than my organization is part of the oppressive blue donut bloc. 
---
&gt;Haven't the big corps now been at one point the small guys?
---
Of course.
---
&gt;Doesn't that mean a smaller group can rise in the ranks, or is it too late for that kind of upward mobility?
---
In theory, sure, in practice, it's arguable that the level of entrenchment and concentrated power is on a different order than it has been in the past.
---
Ignore the sky-is-falling folks in here. Some changes were made, some people disagree with them and are threatening to unsub, until those people and many more are willing to give away their stuff and biomass, the game will keep humming along. The best time to start playing is whenever you wanna sit down and dive in.
---
i fuck your mom
---
I'm surprised the "can I have ur stuff" meme hasn't come back in full flair yet.
---
With all of the nullbloc saltines desubbing and all.

grath funfact pl, nc., horde, the imperium, test will adapt to this changes but the playerbase will be reduced even more or do you think otherwise?
---
We need to nerf vets and we need to nerf time itself as part of chaos.
---
Understading, got popped in ghost site in my astero(alpha), in morning I will prob. feel like moving on, buy new one, profit on exploring until I get popped again on some stupid mistake :D and down the curve again
---
Tl;dr on recent changes: Eve's had some core balance issues for 10+ years that have always gone unaddressed, to the point nobody figured it would ever change. Recently, CCP (the devs) have made several ***fucking massive*** changes to the game in order to try and address these. 
---
The jury's out on whether they'll succeed - and some changes might still be reverted. But a lot of people are turbo assmad that they're losing their long-treasured advantages, or are super freaked to be kicked out of their comfort zone. 
---
For the hardcore players, where the "discomfort zone" is the actual attraction of Eve (real risk, chance of fucking up and losing a lot, etc) we're all pretty stoked about this. I dunno if the balance changes are good or not, but chaos and violence are the lifeblood of the game, so shaking things up is a win in itself.

Sometimes I play eve for 10 minutes in a day and make more progress than days I play for 5 hours.

This isn't a day by day game, it's a year by year game.

Look at this scrub, doesn't even have a FB profile for his EVE character

Null sec was not always safe...it amazes me that the major pipelines into 0.0 are mostly empty.  The loss of regional ore caused that.  (Less pipeline industry needs means less pvp.(

Story from youtube desc
---
&gt;This idiot was being cocky and said "I fight Brutix vs corvette and if you win, you get 200mil" We agree to he takes 1 drone and no guns. I ship scan him with a Nestor to confirm he was not lying. It was the truth. He chooses 1 faction hobgoblin, I have tracking to hit it and drones do too. Barely into armor. I kill this idiot in a CORVETTE. As in rookie ship. And he has a 60 mil pod. 
---
So he agreed to an honourbrawl, kept his word &amp; you shittalk him for it? Also **post the salt** if any, &amp; whether he paid up the 200mil.
---
Harder to catch, easier to kill
---
i couldnt bear that 
---
im german so when others speak dumb shit in german online its "real" and so so so  much worse than in english

im sure im not making sense but idk how else to explain it

Good for you. Want a cookie?

Read the sticky comment
---
But if you use the same type of modules, the bonuses get penalized.
---
Don’t be silly, if you have a fleet whiling to fight 500 caps you can easily afford to suicide multiple Force Recons. For big cap fights this changes nothing.

sadly ccp lost trust 2014 or 2015 and the down spirale from that time on never repaired. they had a influx with alpha accounts and the big news about the big battles, but thats gone since ccp don't give a reason to fight. They changed Moongoo mechanics so people have to earn that stuff via mining which relys on a industry core and "save" place to do so etc. All what they invented backfired and people told them in advance it will :P. This changes we face atm backfire too maybe PL hopes to see goons suffer or so but in reality all sit in the same boat while CCP drills holes in the playerbase with their attitude.
---
Remove market. I want some back alley space trades and handshake deals. Also add hands to pod
---
Poop loads of bubbles on gates with decloak cans around the jump-in points. Also helps to have a pro ceptor pilots that know how to decloak the cloakies.
---
If you believe that the reason you lost your ships was due to bad luck and not lack of preparation or bad decision making; there is a chance EVE  isn’t for you.
---
It's free to at least try so it certainly won't hurt to give it a bash
---
I just started into it after watching Quill18's short series on it (having played back years ago, and then leaving it) and am really enjoying it myself.
---
Then people with thousands of cynos that they already own would see an artificial increase and probably wreck the economy? That’s one of the stupidest things I think I’ve ever heard. 
---
So limiting it to those two classes of ships does two things. It makes you have to invest AT LEAST a recon to cyno in something. And if you don’t have a subcap fleet on grid already to support said recon it will probably die. Yeah some of the stuff will get through. But not all of it and the recon will most likely die. Even if you do have a sub cap fleet that recon is still very easily alphaed by any fleet more than likely. So at that point you need a hard cyno, blops is your best option if you want a good hard cyno that has the ehp for a Fax to be able to keep up so caps and back up can come in. The ehp on blops isn’t even that great even if you bling it. But now you’ve also invested at least a bill worth of subcaps on the field. If fit correctly it’s going to be worth even more than that.
---
The changes are aimed at making it so cynoing in caps isn’t the immediate and only option people will take. You can’t do it on the fly. You have to be prepared for it. This only effects players who can not effectively plan for the future. Personally I am not willing to let this game go to the lowest denominator. Adapt or die.
---
did you watch the video he was pitching a fit after fight called me a fucking asshole and didn’t pay up
---
I reckon if I buy an Orca with tier 2 Warrior drones and tank thermal damage I can kill them while AFK.
---
&gt;The simple fact is if I had no friends or I was a solo player or In fact I was the only person playing eve. 
---
Yeah if you were the only person playing eve then you would have to make a sub to light a cyno.
---
Luckily this is an mmo, not single player. :)
---
So you are a hypocritical moron. Got it.
---
One hob is not enough. Not sure 5 are so how many Orcas we taking about?
---
I don't understand your first question, but a 5 man gang can't easily kill a super or rorq. It would take a very long time to do so.
---
If it’s blue  it’s poo?
---
same

Well, you're talking like i don't know what i am talking about.. . Eve is not a game of instant gratification. Never has.

Same

Ok

Caldari Mustard Race
---
Thing is, ofc you can try to find where theyre coming from and take the fight there. But you dont always know where and its still not fun content for most of us. I dont like it. If I want that kind of playstyle I would go to LS.
---
I know the mechanics. Its just not always easy to know what exact system they are coming from. And its not like they have to warp in to the bubbles either. It can just end in a stalemate with warping around in a system for hours.
---
Like I said, working as intended. I mean youre not gonna get around the fact that NS has tons of manpower. Even if you nerf caps a small gang wont be able to really win a fight in that sense.  But stagnation is more a question of the sov map never changing. No big fights, no wars no nothing. Its already no real reason to fight, now its just a hindrance to do it. 
---
Lol. Can imagine.
---
Wonderful - they'll have heavy loss mails against any good smaller group when they land those cynos repeatedly.    Current Situation:   Send in corvette cyno and drop cyno - hopefully one or two caps come through,  caps now drop cyno and the rest come in
---
New situation:  Send in BLOPS/Force Recon,  it gets popped, maybe you get some in, maybe you don't, but until you get another BLOPS/Force Recon there to also get popped, you can't just continue to escalate based off of a capital launching cyno.
---
There is a lot of doom and gloom in this subreddit, even more on the official forums. Eve is the perfect game to come home from work and get lost for the next few hours.
---
Start an alpha character, read up on some things, fly around the different regions, do some of the career agent missions to get a very small supply of ships and learn the basics, but if it gets boring do something else. If after a month or two, or however long it takes to train through the alpha skills, decide if you want to pay for a subscription. 
---
There is a lot to do. 
---
The basic rules are: 1) only fly what you can afford, and 2) consider your ship as disposable, lost the minute you undock.
---
The person you're responding to is just salty because the latest changes made their specific no-risk playstyle just the tiniest bit risky. A lot of responses you're going to get are going to be like that, ignore them.
---
Checked &amp; it is actually there, good stuff
---
Recommend posting the chatlog separate - you can find it in C\users\you\documents\eve\logs\chatlogs on a pc
---
...or maybe the market has adjusted to the changes?
---
I don't mind the ship change, but the 10 minute afk spool down for a 200m-4b ship is absolutely fucked. If it's a 10 minute max, can there be skills / interface implemented where you only have to keep it lit for no more than 2 minutes minimum?
---
Sorry, I forgot that I shouldn't ruin the fun of people trying to ruin my fun. Indeed, the best meme.
---
this happened a few days ago, how long does it save
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
So your solution is only jump freighters can use cynos?
---
And that was my stupid question of the day, cheers
---
well i din wanna waste to much time editing with bold and stuff . I put some words caps just to highlight it not in the meaning of yelling . i did bold just one thing which i really wanted to deliver .
---
PCU and dotlan say the devs failed dunno about reddit but the statistics in this case are not selfcrafted by hilmar and falcon.
---
Yeah sov is the REAL end game amirite
---
If anyone is like me I have my main to run level 4s on then I have 2 alts using a porpoise and a retriever. I'm obviously going to be paying more attention to the level 4 runner than the 2 mining ships.
---
Waste of a post tbqh
---
Don't listen to these guys. The devs made some changes that makes the game more dangerous. These guys love having it easy and now are very salty for the changes.
---
or responses from people who don't want to risk anything else but get fat kills in nano nullified t3's etc. so both parties are @ their throats atm.
---
&gt; why do ppl need "hate boners"(hilarious) in order to fight.
---
because there's no incentive to fight each other. there's nothing to gain from it.
---
Use a gun. and if that don't work...  
---
Use More Gun.
---
What the miners dont realize is that the harder afk mining becomes the more ore will be worth and active mining will become more profitable.
---
You so smart
---
Try it, test the new player experience, dont go omega for 2 month until you know you like it or not. Eve is special but the special is either yours or its not like any other game you played.
---
All of that sounds unironically great.  Dread fleets need to jump perfectly or you get half your fleet scattered across the system
---
Cap pilots would be less bored if they left goons, test, and horde.
---
With BoB we krab
---
Amen
---
..  and making caps much harder to deploy is going to discourage big fights....
---
And what smaller things would you have done?
---
All super pilots require a fax alt and force recon alt.
---
&gt; Basically, in ye good olden times, there was more variety on the sovereignity map. There were more neutral alliances living closer together, meaning constant skirmishes, big and small.
---
I think you are viewing this with pink glasses. I remember when I had played this game for a few years BOB (+pets) held everything from Fountain all the way around to 46DP. The North was D2 and pets. And the east was held by Russians. The only region that was somewhat chaotic neutral was the drone region and that was just because it was still fairly new at the time (and ratting in drone lands sucked back then). Life wasn't all roses and sunshine back in "ye good olden times".
---
And?
---
And now that prices go up more people are incentivized to produce them. Hooray economics.
---
It's like the Rokh of destroyers.
---
Ccpls buff
---
I would agree to that for Null, delayed info for Low and leave HSec as it is.
---
I used to sit and mine in Omist in 2004. Didn't even have scouts out. Never once got attacked in like... a year. Biggest risk was making sure you tanked the NPCs. Null was safe as fuck then if you were out of the way. No blops, no cloak/warp, no capitals or cynos or anything.
---
More like in grey we play amirite
---
&gt;that big groups are forming as a result to the changes they make
---
The lack of awareness here is staggering
---
ROFL - still dragging out the "little guy gets hurt" trope.  too cool
---
Think you are so funny eh kiddo. You all are the one bitching in these posts. Why are you so ashamed of yourself? Just accept yourself as you are, you are a little pussy. You are against the change here not me. I am rooting for it. Get your facts straight. It is also easily observed that this game makes you miserable, else why come to reddit to bitch about it. Just shut up and play. But i enjoy the salt you guys are producing so i am fine with it. Keep reeeeeeingz i enjoy it very much. Cya till next time.
---
This past decade of a null focused CSM really hasn't been effective then? Except to further make null safer and safer.
---
when nullsec is targeted why should wormhole's be left out? or you try to narrate that wormhole is not as save as nullsec was?`when we all know how save wh's are truly are :P
---
I agree with you if it is a 1v1 thing the higher skilled player will almost always win. But if you have unskilled players that does dumb shit as much as they want and skilled players with limited resources the unskilled players will win out of attrition. 
---
Let’s say the skilled corp is able to kill 4 ships for every one they lose. The high skill corp can only produce .75 of a ship of there losses and the unskilled corp is able to produce 1.25 of every ship lost. Eventually the unskilled corp wins with money than skill. Think of Germany vs Russia : )
---
and thats a bad thing?
---
CCP can't predict how the players will play. The problem lies with the massive blue maxipad in null sec.  In a game where bigger is better, how do you expect the little guy to win? We've been doing this 16 years... the little guy has no chance. The little guy needs to find more little guys and simply fly into null sec and don't leave. That's how you do it. Start shooting shit. No one is going to hand it to you.
---
And all the bots are gone. Win-win by me.
---
They're damn easy to kill if you actually plan. 
---
Especially without a cyno they are gonna die in a fireball 😂
---
The issue is, and has always been, cynosural fields. They broke the game the moment they were introduced.
---
Sov is trash yes you are wrong.
---
I mean all the miners/ratters have to do is pull out the credit card to play like most of them leet pvpers.
---
I think I would have preferred delay chat over complete blackout.   
---
For cynos I think I would liked the option for battleships to be able to cyno.
---
wormholers would want a word with that since for once they could ge t fucked when someone anchors that in their wh.
---
they remote rep so a single drone can't kill them at least in my experience. You need to drop a full damage flight to kill them.
---
Casuals i tell you
---
Yep /endthread
---
that doesn't mean you do a new feature to mask the old feature . You fix your mistakes first . Then lets see if things dont change then do the next change . This is what companies like EA , Bioware did look where they are now.
---
It's a big floating jetcan with significantly more ehp.

---
2014-2016 the exodus, alpha injected new players gave us hope, now we are back to login numbers from 2006 lol.

The first enemy dreads died before the Titan ever jumped, we would have still killed most of the dreads with the Muninns on grid.

Time it to boosh the pod as the recon dies. Carrier is suddenly available

Healthy state or not, the autism of goons knows no bounds. Trying to balance the game against that level of extremity is destined to fuck over a lot of people who aren't goons.

It's an idiot.

&gt;Why are you so ashamed of yourself? Just accept yourself as you are, you are a little pussy. You are against the change here not me. I am rooting for it. 
---
Stop projecting. What change am I supposedly against? I don't give a fuck if they remove cynos from the game. I just think the game shouldn't be balanced around cloaks and bombs, which are now the meta.
---
&gt;It is also easily observed that this game makes you miserable, else why come to reddit to bitch about it. Just shut up and play.
---
Yet you're here bitching on all my comments. Dry your eyes, bitch.

&gt;But i enjoy the salt you guys are producing so i am fine with it. Keep reeeeeeingz i enjoy it very much. Cya till next time.

Waves of proximity bomb deploying stealth bombers.
---
yes we are now bombers online, but after all changes, there will be nothing to hunt in null...

added list of what the effect would be of the offensive and defensive aspect near the top, 3rd paragraph down.
---
They need Eve Classic: no cynos, just gates - back to the good old days where the map mattered, attack plans needed to include escape routes, and people actually bothered fighting.
---
Kinda like the guy who broke up with a really hot chick and then tries to tell everyone else not to hook up with her?
---
This wasn't bait at all it was a joke. Maybe you should take a reading comprehension course.

Oh, god, don't remind me of the Rokh...so much wasted potential.

Thanks for pointing-out it is an "'merican thang".

At least Dingos are finally off-the hook.

small guys need attack things or surprise things... why do we not get more funny mobile devices? mobile inhib, system wide attack inhib etc?

If someone's stupid enough not to recognize the satire we dont need to install handrails for them. This isn't Canada.
---
You're the only one in the comments so far that understands this post
---
&gt;when nullsec is targeted why should wormhole's be left out?
---
Thank you for reiterating my argument.         
---
&gt;when we all know how save wh's are truly are
---
The only people who think WHs are as safe as null are people who've never been there.
---
Oh, and i forgot, he tried to suicide gank my nestor with a tristan
---
They aren't going to all be docked. Rising mineral prices are to lure a lot of them back out. They'll set up recons and blops, and then it'll be a race between cyno jammers and response fleets. This is going to generate fights.
---
New features have always been part of this game. It's a constant balance. Some may agree, some don't. But the idea of creating chaos is by far the best "feature" Eve has had in a long time. 
---
You also have to get into the devs minds. I bet half of what the players do was never the intention of how the devs envisioned the game to be played. That's what happens in a sandbox. 
---
I don't know the answer, but I know change is needed. Keep shanking the jar. Keep throwing shit until something sticks. At this point, they have to.
---
Lol tdf is not Russian
---
&gt;other option would be to focus on moon mining while this lasts, afaik they don't go there.
---
Ohhhh, but they DO. Have a very annoyed mining friend who is trying to figure out how to keep afk mining at the moment.
---
Let's just rename triage to 'Hardware Enhanced Autism Layering Invulnerability Nanite Generator' or 'Latent Omnidirectional Guardian Interface' and be done with it since apparently module names cause such unrest with some players. 
---
Jokes aside, changes proposed by you would not impact my playstyle at all but you got some valid points, like the can't dock - no tether. But overall i feel that you are proposing too much chaos.
---
The amusing thing is all the "trolls" of eve who downvote and are mocking dont seem to get, I didnt actually die to them. But I saw a ton of other player wrecks. Including a few brand new players who JUST joined Corvettes.

They've come close to killing an orca which was afk mining on a moon. I suspect they'll happily tear apart any afk orca they come across.
---
Why would you ever drop a blops when a bomber can do 1300dps to 50km wile being a covops
---
thats snuffed not wormholer's bro:P
---
A lot of people seem to be overestimating how quickly their standing fleet will be able to respond. Going to see a lot of trickled in caps get stranded when those recon cynos get popped and the cynojammer is down.
---
No not really .. CCP is targeting the wrong side of chaos ..you risk living in null sec . Not ratting or mining in nullsec. Without large isk income you dont lose large ships . You can hunt myrmidons all you want ...

I mean listen to its call its fucking scary as shit... this bird will fuck your shit up!

Yea, but bombers + command destroyers is max effort attention and FC skill, vs a cheap bait ship jumping in a super and then hitting the kill button.

Yeah there are Russians who fly shield fleets. I havent seen armour fleet Russians.

funfact wormhole's are save compared to nullsec. your ability's to cut chains is higher than you try to make reddit believe :P if you think nobody in nullsec ever lived in wh's you seem very arrogant. we both know wormhole's are one of the savest way's to print isk. i agree the eviction risk and no asset savety is a thing in your mind but only there cause unless you are a cunt you dont get evicted right?
---
just give them time they'll take 2 steps back with some change that makes nullsec even safer to be in than ever before
---
Ah, maybe I'm confusing the two then.

Shield fit incursion leshaks aren't cheap anyhow. I've seen 6bil+ fits.

Those are just bad games and pretty much a dime a dozen. Eve is unlike anything else. You'll never have a state of Eve where it's all perfect. For 16 years CCP tried thought out strategic plans and carefully concocted feature development. It's time they did something to drastically change the game's direction.  I applaud it.
---
you miss the point:  you wont get them into position.  nor in the numbers needed to bring the caps through, even with reships in the hangers.
---
yep retarded like this subreddit is with their up and downvotes :P i just give your narratives a little counter thats all and we all know wormhole's will be next on the list for chaos.
---
Oh yeah definitely. Got to have the pith b types. They prefer the pith a types.
---
It's such a great looking ship too.
---
Injectors never paid the bills before. Didn't need them. We had like 40,000 logged in all time before injectors and Plex. So the narrative that they need that is a cop out on the CCP sympathizers
---
If you have to ask...
---
Your post is bad and you should feel bad

You're negotiating a better deal, which is why I linked that link. Also, it's not "potentially without good reason". You just don't like it and will try and sound really reasonable to try and get it changed.
---
Look on pyfa, compare it to the concord or t2 variant. If its not objectively better than t2 then it won't be worth building. If its better than t2 but worse than concord you have a ballpark if its better than concord then its guess work.

Stats that will matter are dmg, tracking, optimal/falloff and as its Avatar cpu as its tight as xxxx
---
Sup dumb wh krab
---
You think your preconceived idea on how to play is *the way* to play, and you interpret CCP operating differently as you being ripped off.
---
You appear to have a very entitled, individualist, view about how to play and navigate.
---
sister of eve arc atm the thing people do after the tutorial advised by ccp.
---
No, something more. This makes the cyno vulnerable. Every time an enemy fleet gets on grid and puts down a cyno jammer it's going to be more central to the fight, because the cyno ship is not going to last its entire cycle.

Oh look a post from the gimmick CSM
---
True story
---
yes we both know but the narrative of this subreddit went for that and cried for changes to make such hopes possible and all they got was well less kills than before blackout same will drop even more with cyno changes. dotlan august stats check them double them for 2019 and you see the trend.
---
and everytime ccp fucked up by not doing anything, fuck the playerbase or piss some of them of the numbers got down the toilet flush sadly not the influx of new players :(
---
Read as far as the people stop selling things to goons but I have to comment now. That's not how the market works. Whatever Goons buy is because they are made public for people to buy, and Goons are part of the public.

Based Olmeca

Thanks for the info!
---
Then why wait to make a post about it till they make a cyno change. You are only fooling yourself here. I am just having fun enjoying your salty tears. That is all. It is also very enjoyable to trigger you more and more :D Keeping REEEEEEEEEEEEEing retard.
---
have fun invading malpais, delve etc :P i guess the inhabitants would love your invasion.
---
"More risk for thee and less for mee" Olemca 2019
---
massive amounts of jump fuel are exported out from delve so do you want to have every ammar capital and JF pilot crying because fuel prices jumped also how much of the materials use in high sec production were exported from delve ?
---
blessed olmeca doing the god emperor's work
---
incoming downvote hate train though lol fight the good fight lads
---
1. Wanted a smaller group to hang with. I've been in alliances that are too big to get to know everyone before. Different experience.
---
2. Loved the idea of blackout, but didn't know how long it would last (a week or two?). Wormholes are blackout all the time!
---
'You are butt face nerd haha loser I own you online geek.'
---
Like this but in German?
---
DON'T QUESTION HIS LEGITIMACY!!
---
I don't understand why gates don't ever change. Why aren't there more sudden shifts in what is connected to what, outside of wormholes that can just be rerolled if they are dangerous?
---
i am not comparing both .. or justifying one from the other .
---
i dont have the hopes you are i would love to be wrong in this bet but i guess i won't be wrong. Alpha Injection to playerbase helped them in the end of 2016 when they neglected eve for theit side projects. But still the login numbers dropped out of different reasons. CCP now sees Nullsec as the enemy to fight to retain numbers or players while they do nothing to get new players stay in the game which worked so far, or improved the pve aspects most normal mmo players of today yearn for or are trained for. I agree that bad habits make people quit/don't login but that isse will affect all of eve sooner or later. Beside the regions of Test, Goons, Panfam and Wintercoalition nullsec is a empty wasteland have fun finding a lot of kills. Not only got the nullsec mor suspicious and lookout with dscan, they also got less players. The russian alliances jumped to hisec mission running or abysall t3's. When ccp target specific groups of players the outcome will never be good. Thats why i spin the narrative against the upvote downvote guys from our wormhole dudes who sit fairly save in their isk printing machines compared to the rest of eve :P
---
I mean Horde's out there now so maybe not as rural anymore?
---
If i were making a ship specifically for this i would probably go dual web blaster vni.
---
He literally says that won't happen  right after that sentence l
---
Well yeah that's probably literally what happened. "Oh fuck we didn't code to stop multiboxing ---- wait we get more money this way .... it's not a big it's a feature!".
---
I started two months ago and I'm enjoying it.
---
As a former hardcore raider in WoW, there's less organized PvE in the sense of having 3 or 4 raids a week like in WoW, but still a lot of organized PvE you can do (Incursions are big 40 man things, fairly ease, etc). Closer to WoW would be group PvP. I've only done small-gang PvP so I can't really say how other groups do it, but we roll together anywhere from 1 to 3 times a week for a few hours.
---
For solo play,  there's a lot to do too. I enjoy wormhole stuff, like gas huffing, exploring to find sites to hack and get loot from, and just roaming to find people to kill (or people who venture into our wormhole).
---
There is a steep learning curve, but honestly, it is no where near as bad as I thought as far as knowledge/theorycrafting stuff (the play learning curve is big for sure).
---
I quit WoW because raiding was boring. Blizzard made warriors boring to play. Eve is new. Whether I'll play it for a few months or years, who knows? But for now, I'm enjoying it.
---
If you do decide to play, definitely do the Recruit a Friend think. It will give you 1,000,000 Skill Points, which will save you like 45 days of training as an Alpha (free to play) or ~22 days as Omega (paid) account. There are also some well-priced boosts to buy. If you have Amazon/Twitch Prime you can get 13 days Omega free. There's a month for $7.49 (half price) that'll pop up after you play for a few hours. And you can get other deals too.
---
Pretty much anyone will give you a Recruit a Friend cost - just ask.
---
I'd give it a try!
---
I think you mean the meme CSM
---
No its just salty people who can't make in-game currency as easily in risky space because its slightly more risky again. They might have to *gasp* work together to protect super-valuable, end game ships and we can't have that!
---
ur funny
---
well.. funny or stupid since my reddit name matches my ingame name
---
&gt;Then why wait to make a post about it till they make a cyno change
---
You must be new.
---
I've been posting about their stupid decisions for months now. I disagree with the buff this gives to cloaky cancer, due to the fact that it's a very risk averse playstyle, but apart from that I don't really care. 
---
&gt;your salty tears. That is all. It is also very enjoyable to trigger you more and more :D Keep REEEEEEEEEEEEEing retard.
---
I'm not triggered though? You're misinformed and seem to need to train reading comprehension II to V. Although Judging by your low attributes, that'll take months. Shame you can't inject there irl.
---
Get a fully automatic assault frigate
---
i mean, in a game where there are basically unlimited resources and unlimited queues to build them, yea, people can provide the supply if there is a demand.
---
If you do check it out, I wouldn't spend any money until you see if this is really for you and your comfortable with how volatile the game is at the moment.
---
are you saying its a bad thing that bombers can kill capitals? because its absolutely not
---
i am saying its bad that they can kill everything from caps to frigates
---
It will hurt goons less then your hate boner for us has because we will adapt even though its a bad way to go remove it from sub battle cruiser sure removing it from carriers means there will be less out and black ops is a silly idea drop a super the first thing to die is going to be either the recon or the blops if you can even hold the super down
---
So... Were you born stupid, or did you catch it later in life?
---
&gt; *This is about creating a meta which there are other meaningful playstyles*  
---
Stealth bombers have already been a play style and been killing shit since before you had the hallucination you were good at this game.
---
&gt; *Its just a bit more complicated than 'light cyno/wait for help'.* 
---
Funny coming from the other side of this argument which essentiallyoperates solely on the strategy of "light cyno/wait for more blops help"
---
&gt; *But you don't know how many players are coming back, how many began to log in to kill stuff etc.* 
---
Yes we do, the data is all there if you know how to read it. Just waiting for one more month under the belt to illustrate the failure this has all been.
---
&gt; *No it won't, and I agree it'd be nice to have big capital fights. But it's not about creating that.*  
---
Nope, it's only about your playstyle and what you think is fun b/c no one else matters.
---
&gt; *It will be a new meta where people will need to bring recons for capital  movement, and will have small windows to jump on cynoes. It's nothing  big alliances can't adapt though.* 
---
We already do this, literally no change until it comes time to actually enter the battle which is nerfed significantly. Congrats, BlueBall \[BB\] stock just skyrocketed 500% on the DOW. 
---
&gt; *Moving capitals undefended will indeed be costlier. But most people I  talk to are fine with it, as they typically play to kill ships in  regions which they don't live.*  
---
Yeah, sure, until you start losing recons in NPC Delve immediately after the cyno goes up from snipes and then mass spam report the guy who dropped a bubble on the station for exploits b/c THA DIAMOND RATS ARE MEAN when he hasn't even logged in.
---
You are such a meme.
---
They killed an expensive ship and didn't lose that much. 100b killed vs 40b lost.
---
Why? Not like anyone else uses caps quite as much, except maybe snuff.
---
Always a pleasure to watch a battle heron compilation.
---
For the less savvy player, these mechanics sound ridiculously complex though.
