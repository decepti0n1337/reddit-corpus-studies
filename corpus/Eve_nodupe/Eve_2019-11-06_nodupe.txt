&gt;I have several personal moons in hs
---

---
i hope each of your stations is under different corp and they are named differently from each other, otherwise wrecking machine. and pirat are already on the way with a ransom note
---
---
---
It was always a pleasure to fly with Cryo in BGH as well as in Eagles. We will miss you Cryo, we will miss you.. o7
---
Bwahahahaah, I almost pissed myself laughing when I read this.
---
All I see is a twat complaining because there's a way to evade a PvP encounter, and is now looking for an easier way to force a fight without flying the correct ship or using the right fittings. There is a counter they're called Interdictors. Or are you too scared to fly in expensive ships solo, because you might lose them? And yes, there are counters to Interdictors as well, so you'll be complaining about that too!!!
---
Happened to me again last night.. Seems to be just Fortizars that do it.
---
Pretty sure it depends on who created the corp, not current CEO
---
Do you own the ihub?
---
I see you carbon, I see you
---
Oh okay, I didn't get that impression from what your responding to but I could definitely see people saying that. If it was limited to inside the site itself I guess it could be okay, but it would just make them more lucrative targets for ganking (not that I think it would push them over any thresholds).
---
so you telling me maybe one of biggest rmt corps in the game that has been even failed the pity standards of frat and ranger regiment, is now working with RA and taking sov from winter co's ashes?
---
I was training one into the ultimate explorer and got distracted trying to get more gunnery and space ship command sp. Gotta get him back on track.
---
&gt;Risk averse?  I'm out flying solo right now, I don't see you though :(.
---
Oh cool, you're soloing anoms? That sounds pretty risky dude, fly safe o7o7
---
For the record I am solo pretty much 100% of the time because everyone from my alliance jumped ship from this terrible dying game
---
&gt;And what you should be hearing instead of the shit you claim, is that smart people should be able to not die everytime you decide to shoot at them.
---
Not what I'm saying at all but it doesn't seem like anything is getting through your skull, so I'm not gonna try
---
Horde once apon a time had a website for all there moon extractions.. No idea how it works just know its possible. Sorry I'm not much help. Should update if you get it working I'd be happy to add mine.
---
Oh boy do those prices go up after the 3% ones, donâ€™t know how much a difference itâ€™ll make, but canâ€™t hurt.
---
Yeah, as I progress through and learn it a bit more Iâ€™ve grown to like, and appreciate, small ship combat. Iâ€™m just not very good at it.
---
lol
---
No, literally, that is what you are saying. You are butthurt because a few smart ratters got away from you. For the record, I don't PvE, I have a job that more than pays for my Eve extravagances. But hey, it was a nice shade attempt, it just fell short, kinda like the rest of your arguments.
---
I love the caracal/ Cerberus modeling. Any recommendation to use them for making isk?
---
So they should sit in the anom alone so the gang of PvP fit ships can kill them? 
---
You are special.
---
There is a cap between encouraging battle between alliance and changing how an entire space work so the very vocal 10 man gang who barely play eve can jerk off on their VNI/Excavator kill
---
CCP wants to know your location
---
and blackglass
---
I think you are misunderstanding how escalations work, mate. Confusing them with DED anomalies perhaps?
---
Anomalies are the ones you scan down; the ones everybody can get to. Escalations are the ones you get from ratting; the ones generated specifically for a specific player. The latter is not accessible to anybody without a bookmark to the site. The only two ways to get there is to either receive the gate location from the player that generated it, or to combat probe a players ship while the ship is inside the instance. (Which is childishly easy to avoid.)
---
30,000 people could be sitting in that system, but none of them could get into that dungeon unless the player let them in, either willingly or through immense stupidity.
---
To me that fits the "instance dungeon" descriptor perfectly.
---
The short answer:  Because it would take more them that to actually fix Eve for pvp.
---
The first thing we should do is define the problem. Stagnation is the root issue. It manifests in part through Blue donut, n+1, Bat phones and helldunk or blue balls. Small unaffiliated pvp corps can no longer survive.  
---
Now if CCP used a decision making model and tried to correct it, they will easily end up with 5-10 large changes with resource depleting potentially being one of them. 
---
Eve will only survive with pvp at the core or a complete and total pve over haul that turns it into wow in space. It can't poorly straddle both worlds forever. CCP doesn't have a road map because the problem is too complicated and vast for one big solution and the longer they wait the less appealing the economics of trying.
---
The answer is simple. Not every country had colonies all over the world. And my did not. Also being occupied by turks for 150 years, then occupied by nazies, then occupied by soviets and now extorted by the EU is not helping the wages. So yeah. There are many many countries, more than you think which are like this. As i told many times before. If you earn 10Â£/h then you are in the lucky 3-5%of the human population.
---
It exists in shared space dude. Just having no beacon doesn't make it instances.
---
At no point does th escalation player have any power to be in there only with those he chooses.
---
You keep missing the limit on the instanced dungeon. That nobody else can come in.
---
You keep just skipping right over that.
---
ON THE ARCHIVED FORUMS OF A DEAD GAME? THAT'S NO BETTER THAN HAVING NOTHING WRITTEN AT ALL
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
UNIRONICALLY THOUGH THERE ARE SOME GOOD FORMULAE IN HERE. THANK YOU.
---
What im reading here, is that you're upset the ships that can't shoot back are near a thing that can shoot back
---
"Dissuade conflict," said to someone whose alliance just wound up nearly a year and a half of continuous warfare.
---
Name checks out
---
Right click your laser, click show info and select the used with tab. It will tell you what ammo you need.
---
No need to have all skills at V in scanning, since you only use either Hacking or Archeology when youâ€™re already inside an exploration site, and theyâ€™re good to have at V yeah.
---
Nickname does not check out.
---
SENPAI IT WONT FIT IN THERE
---
I'm sure you can. But not rigged with the old large rigs.
---
Yeah, and I personally donâ€™t have one, but I saw on videos that the Zeugma analyzer plus Blackglass implant just murders pretty much any  node &gt;.&lt;
---
Anyone that holds ceo can apply their characterâ€™s corp management skills and the updated max members stays.
---
Iâ€™d say if another Permafrost event is coming, you should firesale the analyzers you still have and go farm them for the event duration to refill your stock, since the analyzers will drop in prices with new modules on the market :)
---
Thatâ€™s why thereâ€™s this great module called the Cargo Scanner &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt; Do you ever post anything positive?
---
when there are positive things to post about, yes.
---
Hahahahaha ðŸ˜‚
---
Binary system?
---
or is it that it's just not a big enough money spinner to fight over to keep for yourself when it's easier to just say "fuck it, split it between us"?
---
i know it makes a lot of money, but what's the opportunity cost and actual cost of constantly sending shitty ferox fleets to the arse end of high sec to contest/defend it?
---

V-3 lol I was chased off by an orthrus in my wolf the last time I went. I was having a fun fight against a stiletto and arbitrator but he had to join in his orthrus to ruin the fun
---
^ This.
---
The point is. People that do PvE stay. I myself am a big PvE player doing mining and industry, which I love. From time to time I also enjoy blowing up spaceships with my friends.
---
The people that are vocal about not being able to masturbate to their Myrm/VNI/Exca kill will leave anyway sooner or later (and probably sooner) because they are too 3lite for EVE.
---
Did you read what you just said
---
&gt;Use d-scan
---
&gt;Use dotlan
---
&gt;Use the right fit
---
Even a monkey can do this there is nothing challenging and you dumbasses should stop pretending that it's some kind of "art". It's not. That's why if you post a ratter killmail in channels like BSB you will get mocked because experienced PvPers know how easy it is. It's one of the lowest forms of PvP right above gate camping

I feel you are thinking of yourself as a very smart guy and you trolled me and farmed my salt .... i let you live with this belief and keep laughing about tryhards like you ...

At this time it was, but maybe you dont know, young gun ....

It's impossible to lose a can it unless you're deliberately trying to do so. I don't think I've failed a single one since I started using  Blackglass + Zeugma combo a year ago.

Data5 and Cybernetics 5 are worth it for the Zeugma and Blackglass :P

Guess Iâ€™m just being overly worried about missing stuff as Iâ€™m travelling a long way to get there. Thanks for helping, I retract my earlier statement about being condescending :)
---
The last low was a Damage Control II.  Sorry, was doing it from memory at work.
---
Oh danm, this game is so amazing :(
---
Erm, in fact, T2 prizes (ships, modules, components) went upwards from 25-75% approx. with the Lifeblood Moonmining Patch, as the percentage of actually harvested moons went down dramatically with it, especially in Lowsec. After the Umbrella-Blocks have tuned up their Multibox-Capital-Mining-Game it stabilized a bit but still is way above 2014-15 T2 prices ...
---
Good call, the triglavian stuff is new to me too - will definitely try that.
---
Yeah I could see why its a priority for any authoritarian government.
---
Okay retard
---
I'm currently in the same situation, i have 3 Friends who want to play the game with me and i'm here sitting on 80M SP and a lot a knowledge.
---
An advice for you Ask them what they want to do in the  game, give them a goal so they stay hooked on the game.
---
Nah, that's what we call "lying" :)
---
Think I am going to make the trip this weekend. I've never been and I want to stare into the shiny
---
Yea, had the same issue as the others. Couldn't find that many fits and the ones that I could find were too expensive.
---
Worth the effort - that's a nice pic!
---
Hisec is spooky
---
Because we've been asking for alliance bms forever
---
Im teaching my friend and I tried exploration with him and it wad too dense to start. Now the plan is to fit up two low-skilled battlecruiser with a tinker set up or RR and go tackle some anomalies or wormholes. 
---
The fact we are utilizing RR or cap transfers to handle harder content has a fun appeal to it. Even for me.
---
if they close waffles, i stop coming to this subreddit once and for all
---
You could also do some faction warfare together. Tear around in frigs and dessies
---
Botting is shit no matter where it happens, that is common ground for us I guess. 
---
But we just witnessed some kind of derailing campaign starting with blackout that clearly showed (see Vegas Stats Graph) that local is the most crucial tool for botting outside empire, where Members of the 2 southern big blocks claimed that its all real players that quit in Nullsec, and that "the bad bots" all run in Hisec ...
---
Hah. A true Eve welcome
---
Nerf bounties by 10% and buff player owned strutchure mandatory tax rates to 5%.
---
also not forget to visit the black Monolith 2 or 3 jumps from it in Dead End
---
Last night: Megathron on dscan! Oh. Two of them. Hole getting rolled. Not worth the effort.
---
More like, there's less veldspar (and by extension, tritanium) shat out by the rorquals than any other ore. The supply greatly outstrips demand for the "rare" materials, even considering the capital production diarrhea happening in nullsec so they become.. kind of really cheap. 
---
As for general mining advice.. Go find some expensive gases, and huff them, otherwise, don't. Or get a few more accounts and join the cancerous Rorqual swarm (or equally cancerous Orca blob) I guess.
---
Resource depletion is pointless as a fix. Fix power projection and basic content generation and you'll get way more bang for your buck.
---
The star restores HP (coherancy) to defencive nodes and the box reduces your virus strength. Ultimately the board get's stronger and stronger while you're attacks are weakened.
---
I'm gonna laugh when China simply goes Internet isolation-mode. All the developers investing so much money into that market. LOL!!
---
hate carbon cat.
---
&gt; The "1000 tec" that you mined just respwaned on your allies yard or your foe farm...
---
Cool, So instead of going out and fighting to control it, I just wait and let them farm it, Because In the time it takes me to find it, They'll have mined it out, And it'll be back in my space
---
Steal ores from lowsec R32\\64 mining citadels, if you're just looking for shiny rocks.
---
Right, that's kinda the point. More would spawn eventually, it would be an opportunistic resource. In any case, it was just a random thought, I don't particularly care to defend the idea. I was just trying to provide a fun example of a way to make things a little more interesting across all security zones.
---
There are people in America who want the same sort of system. The same ones who want a Ministry of Truth (or whatever they want to call it) to make sure only government-approved opinions are expressed online.
---
It's tied to the pirate rat type and it is r8 and r32 goos.
---
TBH, the prices on T2 ships right now feel pretty reasonable. The only ones that feel a bit out of line are the marauder because it's weak in a lot of situations right now, and maybe command destroyers because of how strong they are.
---
go into wormhole space, do some C2/C3 sites close to Jita, and get ganked by wingspan, have fun keep on playing
---
+ more trained out Rorqual-Accounts --&gt; even more injectors due to SP-Farming

An even more effective change would be to make the ESS part of the Ihub and move all bounty payment to the ESS instead of to wallet. When bots dock up you just go to the ESS and take all their money.
---
Suggestion.. Announce theses things a week or two before you want to do it... Not literally the day before.. This has always infuriated me personally. I can't attend something I dont know is happening till the day before when I already have plans.
---
Then dont rat in those ships (smartboming battleships)? You are complaining about a nichecase
---
I do.
---
TL;DR "Guys we left because we did not get communication officer roles and also blame AFK leadership for too many blues, but we are going to use this thread to say we are RECRUITING, come and join us!"
---
No way to get a mirror before the test?  A bunch of us made structural changes since last time to see how the system holds up.  Speaking for me personally, I was really looking forward to seeing how the system handled the 80 different folders, and how efficiently I could share those with a new character and merge down the 500ct shared folders into 3000ct local folders for a use workflow.
---
It's one of the "Oh I must have this role coz I am important" so you can say and ping on coms "Guys, bookmarks cleared, pathfinder up to date" (aka: hey look at me I am useful I right clicked two times and I have roles that you do not have)
---
So I can't really attest to the market forces for T2 production, but historically there was price fixing centered around technitium prior to lifeblood.
---
 This was in reaction to a rebalance that attempted to help the bottlenecking of R64 materials, but in practice just shifted the necking to technitium which was concentrated most heavily in the northern regions.
---
Sure fights happened over tech moons and R64's but I think it would be hard to say that very many wars did...
---
&gt; ~Communist~ Totalitarians control your life, itâ€™s what they do.
---
Correct. Blame Shamis for all of this.
---
Yes, your right this sub is shitty.
---
Believe CCP has said that the average age of an eve player is 35+ years of age, but the Chinese Eve community could be different.
---
CCP baited us all back to activity with the blackout, thinking that they were finally taking steps to empower smaller groups that rely on hit and run tactics. Changes to cyno's were also great, made it *slightly* more difficult for groups sitting under a super umbrella to effectively respond quickly. 
---
When they took that away (blackout) our activity numbers dropped overnight, and many of our content creators said "fuck it" and either went AFK or decided to go play other games again.  While none of us imagined that the blackout would be permanent (although may have dreamed), we expected CCP to at least have an announcement following the end of it with a plan moving forward on advancing the theme during blackout of "making things dangerous". When that didn't happen we all held on to the hope that they'd make this sort of announcement at Vegas. Clearly this didn't happen. Yea you have some subtle QOL changes like shit with the jump beacons/gates but they've yet again failed to address some of the major issues that have over time removed significant amounts of "risk" that used to be present. Citadels remain a gigantic shitshow that managed to turn EVE into nothing short of Farmville in Space.
---
Further, Waffles as an entity has always thrived on short term deployments and goals that last about 3-6 months. WH's were nice for a bit, and really nice with the blackout. But unless you plan on going full-"wormholers btw" and doing evictions etc. the daily/nightly grind of rolling the NS and doing nano stuff etc loses it's fun factor quickly. Others may enjoy this playstyle, but many within Waffles did not and after a few months (and the loss of blackout) were ready for something new. 
---
Long story short, many of us don't see a way ahead for smaller groups, see CCP's design decisions to be driving people toward big bloc playstyles, and finally the repetitive nature of living in a WH which lost it's luster for many of our members after a few months. 
---
With that said and moving forward...Waffles is joining Horde as a SIG with the intent to do quick turn deployments, like we used to do in Lowsec (RIP) when we took various contracts etc. Waffles and Horde have maintained close relationships for years despite the incessant reeee-ing of many people who (falsely) believed that resetting Horde would instantly solve perceived content problems.
---
When only bounties are even close to recovered? Sure :)
---
Or you know, the entire map is scaled to Jita + Perimeter and therefore completely worthless.

Its a shame really. Lowsec is deader than ever including in my neck of the woods.

CCP sitting on their hands with lowsec and FW for years isn't doing the game any good.

Just move it somewhere like ls/ns/wh so you can shoot back

Yes. Giveaways are legal (like in streams) but anything requiring you to give isk isnt allowed
---
We actually have resolved our issues diplomatically. We will not seek revenge though we will shoot each other if we meet.
---
Straight up 100m an hour sometimes up to 120
---
CODE and PIRAT confirmed the only real pvp'ers now?
---
I use a rattlesnake for these solo. Dps is lower than I want but it has to be as you need shield relays to give yourself enough shield hp/s to make it through without warping off.
---
As hinted by the other replies, can you be more specific?
---
REEEEEE
---
Meh, your "It's one of the ..." is so wrong I cba to fix it.   
---
Thanks tho, the guys will definitely have some fun. We are deploying soon.
---
There's a delay in ESS payout. It's 1 minute right now but can always be adjusted up. With a the ESS as a known priority target, it's possible that hunters warp straight to the ESS instead of into anoms, and pop the ESS puller.
---
You can make "anchoring" a requirement to interact with the ESS, which will stop alpha pods being posted on the ESS.
---
Yeah once I stopped trying the grind for is my game time got a lot more fun. 30 bucks a month for 2 accounts is 2 hours of work a month for me. Once I got that through my thick skull I've been content.
---
B...but self imposed space justice based on lower motives!
---
Almost like a simple "he didnt decloak within 60 seconds"? Decloak him anyways.
---
Appreciate the feedback. 
---
Our defense doctrine is pretty pathetic for dealing with wormhole enemies who are consistantly flying t3 fleets while we are flying t1 hulls for no reason.
---
As for lifeboats. We have enacted moves immediately to make sure we can secure basically every asset from now on. This was a huge problem as we simple didnt have enough cargo to save everything.
---
No idk required. Source: Am member. Have won.
---
As a CEO i would be so pissed you posted this. Not only have you made your CEO pay $500 to save your stuff, his stuff and the corp, you have come on here and boasted about it.
---
As a CEO the last thing you want after a loss like this is people knowing this type of shit.
---
Also i feel you blatantly now have put a target on that corp as many people will now come knocking on your door.
---
I dont know what level you are in that corp but well done for creating the worst possible outcome for your corp.
---
We had 54 players involved not including alts and several of us were turbo-nerd multiboxers. I know we had 11 Nightmares, 10 Basilisk, 2 Bhaalgorns and a fuck load of Loki's (was a pulsar). Was a pretty nasty fleet. The alpha alone from the nightmares was a big yikes (we 2 shot a 1bil tengu with only 4 of the nightmares).
---
Now, now... No need to be snarky and condescending if you don't know the answer to the OP's question.
---
If you're so smart please share a fit so us clueless noob wannabe's can die as content in you wh...
---
I like that the image basically sums up the end result. People will join, throw their ISK into this, and at the end of the day, OP's gonna be on the other end with all of the isk from suckers.
---
Never heard of em.
---
RIP Snuff.
---
Who's waffles btw?
---
If your fort was fit with a web and tons of ecm, and you had a lot of long range painting ships to enlarge the sigs of our ships, your dreads would have gone to town with our logi ecm'd  most of the time. That very likely could have forced us off grid. Another option, since youre in a pulsar is cruise ravens. Enough of them massed together with ecm support from the fort could potentially wear us down. All things that youll have time to plan and think about. And like I said we have nothing against you guys so if you need a hand/some to bounce ideas off of just give us a shout
---
This thing isn't really connected to the EVE client, or your EVE accounts, tho. It's a totally separate thing.
---
Its free to enter. No isk to be sent.
---
Buy plex, sell plex, ????, buy ships with RL money
---
Also, theres nothing wrong with t1 ships. Youll notice we like flying drakes a lot, and EPSYN likes flying cyclones a lot. T1 can be very strong if used correctly
---
And i need you to fix your main game, CCP.
---
Neither is happening.
---
Implementing resource depletion, in any form, cannot come first; citadel reinforcement timing tweaks and the addition of doorbell structures/assets are needed before anything else.
---
Listen, I don't need much of a reason to go shoot goons, and I've certainly never observed them needing a reason to shoot me. In fact, fuck \*\*everyone\*\* in this game (in space) that isn't explicitly in My Group. But as much as we're all willing and eager to pewpew, nobody wants to spend their weeknights forming for structure bashes that invariably turn into blueballs in both directions.
---
Citadel reinforcement mechanics are so \*\*very\*\* un-fun that there is no in-game motivation that will compel them on any significant scale.
---
Check your DM babe
---
You don't see how testing this tech could be relevant to fixing a great deal of the issues we have in EVE?
---
All I see is shitty excuses and reasons not to undock and be always on the safe side. There is still plenty of content out there, just need to gid gud to catch it. Change my mind.
---
How your previous style is superior to joining the big blob cancer?
---
Fuck off
---
Glad you got it working!  Now go forth and pew pew throughout New Eden
---
Sorry bro CCP outlawed all gambling already
---
Probably there is will be five people runing abyssals after event end. Again. With iki/fiend/curse spam.
---
This is how you kill a once well respected corp. Welcome to the TiDi blob.
---
There were literally no drones involved in this photo, idk how u got drones stuck in your head when it's a gas mining Moa
---
Sounds like another source of content is leaving the game!
---
On that note!
---
RvB is recruiting!
---
Nice. But my point is still relevant.
---
Yep. 
---
This isn't a beta. It's not even an alpha. It's not a game. It's a tech demo.
---
So just undercut him by a little bit and become rich off of his stupidity as either he or other people are going to buy from him.
---
You don't need to do all three.
---
So people just undercut him by a little bit and become rich off of his stupidity as either he or other people are going to buy from the person doing the undercutting.
---
I ran it through CCP in a few fanfest, they have no issues with it. And its been up for many years.
---
If he picks the right items, supply and floating isk make that harder. Personally I would go injectors / plex - itâ€™s a risky investment as well, but pays off very nicely.
---
People are generally welcoming but you do have to find a good group. A lot of random people you meet will help you if you aren't afraid to ask.

A RLML cerb can run most lowsec DED sites. Fit a buffer tank and MWD. None of the rats can hit past ~50km and you can hit out to 88km with a Missile guidance computer. Destroy webbing towers first and read the wiki for each site before you run them.  You will need a probing ship to find the sites.

There is currently another bot called u/kzreminderbot that is duplicating the functionality of this bot. Since it replies to the same RemindMe! trigger phrase, you may receive a second message from it with the same reminder. If this is annoying to you, please click [this link](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kzreminderbot&amp;subject=Feedback%21%20KZ%20Reminder%20Bot) to send feedback to that bot author and ask him to use a different trigger.
