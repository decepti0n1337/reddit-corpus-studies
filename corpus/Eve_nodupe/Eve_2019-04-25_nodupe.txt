Logi pilots are fucking awesome. Everyone loves them. They're the unsung heroes of EVE. You can start flying logi very early in logistics frigates and then upgrade to logistics cruisers and eventually force auxiliaries (fax).
---
I fly frigate logi and I am starting to train into cruiser logi now. It's super fun, scary as shit, and really active. There are also plenty of other roles you can do, like links, which are buffs you give everybody in your fleet!
---
If you have any questions, you can always message me here or on Discord (Aimsucks#0001). My corp, Dreddit, is part of one of the largest alliances in the game and we always take in newbros to help them learn the ropes. We do a TON of fleet stuff and provide free ships to new players, free skillbooks, and mentors to help you learn the ropes. Check out our recruitment process [here](http://dredditisrecruiting.com/).

---
You can definitely be a support player. I do it all the time and it's my preferred game style. I really don't like playing damage roles. You have a few options in that regard, EWAR and Logi. Logi is your more recognized healer and you actually rep (repair) your allies shields and armor (and hull, but don't do that, it's awful.).
---
EWAR is a second powerful option for support players that can sometimes be even stronger for the fleet composition than healing. They do things like drain your enemy's capacitor (so that they can't shoot your allies and die faster), disrupt weapons (so that they miss their shots against your allies), dampen and ECM (so that they literally can't even lock up your allies). EWAR is sometimes stronger for smaller ship fights or where you are fighting bigger things. 
---
Here's an example: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76313135/
---
I used ECM in this fight so that my allies didn't die instantly in one hit to the Brutix Navy. No amount of healing can rep something that's dead. But that's not to say healing isn't good! There's nothing better than landing reps on someone at 10% structure and keeping them alive for that fight. 
---
Both play styles are definitely rewarding and I can't wait for Logi to finally show up on killmails without having to drone whore.
---
I hope you enjoy CCPs take on it. We refer to the healer class as "logi" (not to be confused with "logistics" which is the transport of goods).
---
Logi players are much loved in Eve, any ship you lose on behalf of your Corp/Alliance will be likely replaced throigh a ship replacement program, or you'll just get straight up paid. I've heard of at least one group that pays it's logi 200% SRP.
---
Good luck! You're doing bobs work.
---
I have no idea what’s going on but upvote for quality. There emotions matched your script perfectly
---
Fuck. NC.
---
This is some shit tier research hombre.
---
logistics players are either betas or women
---
A server reset every 2 years ? 
---
Would not fly, No one would play on it.
---
EvE is a long term game, not a 1 hour,  1 week,  1 month or even a 1 year game.
---
When people invest their time and money into something long term, they would want to be compensated in some way if someone or something suddenly decided they were going to take what that person had worked for away.
---
And both of them are Mittani alts
---
Logi friend logi friend logi friend!!!!!! 
---
Ok so first you wanna go for logi frigates like the bantam. There is one for each race 2 shield 2 armor. After that t1 cruisers until t2 frigates and cruisers. But be aware logistics isnt the only support role. E-war, boosting and tackling is also very important for the success of fleets. The biggest and meanest supporters are Force Auxiliaries. Capital class logi ships like the apostle. Look them up and get your mouth drooling. 
---
One thing you should never forget, logistics cant fight on their own. Its not like a healpriest who also has offensive spells. When you are in a logistic ship you will do next to nö damage, therefore it is a good idea to also look into dps ships and maybe train basic skills for them. 
---
Now go out make friends, make enemies, but most important have fun and enjoy your time.
---
I'm not 100% about our opsec with doctrine ships. Sabres and Stilettos are pretty standard, but there are a ton of other ones I'm being told to train into.
---
Every 3 months, and they are worth 200-500 mil each. They're fun, and they get you crazy standings.
---
But but but you could get your name put into the book!!
---
Thank you!
---
Imagine been pets of goons
---
*Oh wait...*
---
Yes, it's entirely subjective. Do you want a corp where fools are gladly suffered or do you want one that takes itself seriously? Do you want to be in a tryhard corp or one with the attitude that it's just a game and doesn't matter? Do you want to be in a small corp where you accomplish less but your contribution means more, or a big corp where they accomplish a lot but it's harder to stand out? Do you want to be in a corp that participates in the kind of battles and high level politics that books are written about or are you OK with being obscure? Do you want to be in a corp where it's mandatory to attend ops or one with a lenient inactivity policy?
---
Your results will be hit-and-miss until you figure out what you want from your corp and what you have to offer.
---
Horde and pl don’t really obey each other.  They co-operate.
---
Which is easy to mistake as horde serving pl. but the reality is horde is always starving for content, and if PL can make some, horde will happily come to the bat phone(bean phone)
---
And vice versa.
---
NO U
---
No need to CTA when TEST drop forts any more since they can’t even show up to defend.
---
Yes I'm sure that will force major coalition to enter in a massive war again
---
Have to be more specific than that, your alliance name against and who if you know?
---
So you're not in KarmaFleet?
---
Yeah, mad props for discussing Eve Online while playing Anno 1800...
---
Mittani was Mango all along, playing 4D chess with all of EVE across multiple servers
---
Yup its possible. And one of the fastest ways to be able to participate in some high level content.
---
Unlike DPS, logis dont need to train weapon skills.
---
Ian is a stand up guy, and you're a twat for saying otherwise.
---
Indeed though most people would favor skill Farms to be operated at a loss
---
That's why I suggested doing it on an alternate server.  If people know from the start that there will be a reset, their behavior changes, they become less risk-averse, and they're not going to demand compensation when they knew what was going to happen when they got into it.
---
I thought you meant the Californian melee player for a second and I got really confused.
---
Yes, with some brain and perseverance its quite possible. 
---
I started like october 2017; watched some youtube videos on exploration; plexed my self 18 days after creating account from exploration; around july 2018. i bought a rorq (ultimate mining ship), and after that its been easy mode really. The rest of the time i trained skills for fleets and stuff, and made an alt. Only paid for a couple of months of omega because of bundles being cheap.
---
I have put some thought into it, medium sized Corp, pref Jspace or nullsec (but not to the point where id end up as yet another carebear), active in both Pve and PvP since I wanna do combat just as much as PI and Indy, friendly enough to offer advice seeing as how I'm returning and things have changed, active on discord or other comms around US times. Don't really care about who's at war with who so I can join any side if needed.

So now let's think from both perspectives how would the nano gang win against caracals and how do the caracals win, like what does this fight look like both winning and losing and you quickly realize why the nano gang runs from caracals.

I’m sure somebody will provide you with the right links but I’ll give you a few advices from personal experience.
---
I’ve been playing for about 4 months now and I have learned quite a lot and I can proudly say that I have a decent understanding of the game at this point. But trust me once you get the hang of the game, YOU WILL LOVE IT.
---
Firstly, get the hang of the game a little bit, run through tutorials, play solo for a few days till at least you understand the controls and how certain things work. Then you should look for a corporation (guild), look for ones that are newbie friendly, avoid the Huge blob corporations that are “newbro” corps, you will be just another noob in the pond, you won’t get the same attention as you would in a smaller Corp, but I would highly suggest joining Eve University as you will learn A LOT from them.
---
Money making, You will find out what you enjoy from the tutorial and get the hang of each profession, however you can definitely start off by mining, even though it’s one of the worst and most boring ways of making money, it’s an option as I remember dying countless times to rats (npcs) when I first started so pve wasn’t an option just yet. The best active money making imo is exploration, also a tip let’s say every 50-100mil loot that you have in your inventory, try to drop it off at a nearby station just in case you die and come back later to collect it. Also never have heaps of isk laying around, unless you’re saving for something or you need it, ALWAYS invest it.
---
Lastly, never fly what you can’t afford to lose which is self explanatory, you’re never safe in this game, somebody can blow up your shit at anytime. Also make friends, friends and a fun company is what adds the cherry on top, it makes the game even more enjoyable.
---
I would also like to locate and find bots for killing! If enough of us make it unprofitable, yadda yadda yadda...
---
lmao, you are a knob, sir.
---
Your head is going on a pike you vegetable sympathiser.
---
YEah they use asic miners these days
---
I always recommend new players go join the corporation **EVE University**. They will teach you all about the game.
---
Wow thats like 5 whole percent.
---
well, at least catching botting vnis are REALLY not worth it if you are doing it for profit.
---
yep, you can make some solo "kills" of some fction cruiser "pilots", like this: https://zkillboard.com/kill/76395937/
---
but thats just all
---
no he went to home story cup back in 2014 just as we moved to venal with BL. he never came back from homestory cup.
---
Yeah I have my ID10T form......but when I see a group exploiting the weaknesses of rental empires so they can set up their OWN rental empire....it really makes me wonder what you are smoking! 🤣😂🤣
---
Every corp that has ever existed has always needed Logi!  Welcome space bro!
---
When there is a goon to shoot people shake hands and do the universe a favour for the greater good.
---
lol, yeah... In truth they were created at a pretty different period of time but I wish it was all uniform.
---
Where did I say I was doing this for profit? I dont need isk.
---
&gt; Then don't come period.

had the same thing. get a ship replacement from CCCP they will do it.
---
kick MACE
---
I mostly disagree with the whole "there can't be an EVE 2.0". While the way you speak of would indeed render everything meaningless and so not work, there is one solution to it.
---
EVE 2.0 should be the mechanics and performance of the game fixed, along with some extra features/content. What is stopping a hypothetical CCP from imaging TQ and copying players and assets and even citadels etc over to the new game? Work, maybe a lot of it, but that would be part of the development of 2.0. Plug the accounts in along with assets of every kind, do any necessary conversions of whatever (skills, assets etc) and the game is good to go and no one loses anything.
---
Now before anyone accuses me of stupidity, i realise that this would require a lot of work (though CCP already runs similar scripts when updates happen or to copy things over to SiSi for example). But if you're ever gonna make EVE 2.0, not putting this extra work in would be insane imo.
---
Hah, as a history nerd I had to ask Soter who the mysterious figure behind the founding of our Alliance was. : )
---
That's actually pretty good
---
I bet you could find them with asic miners
---
I remember bombing Geemu!
---
bitches love logi
---
&gt;Doesn't this sub complain about. Cloaky camping daily. Use it to your advantage. Fight fire with fire
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So I'd have to plex (cause cloak) and sacrifice an account that I could use to play the game to sit there to do CCPs job that I am at least in part already paying them for ?
---
I'm no great hunter or anything, but after a couple days doing roughly same thing just in another region I gave up on it. This shit just gets old real quick.
---
I really don't get why CCP doesn't jsut come in and clean up the whole shitload of them, its not like they're hard to locate. And this is not the only region either  [https://zkillboard.com/ship/17843/losses/](https://zkillboard.com/ship/17843/losses/)  and its not exactly hard to go through a list to at least see the areas that need to be checked.
---
I always recommend they join KarmaFleet, but I'm a bit biased lol.
---
E-Uni is just as much of a blob than any other corporation. 
---
As far as just another number, that is not the experience that new members of KarmaFleet report. I mean, you may think that a new, small, corp is good and all, but those corps also do not have the programs available, not the experienced staff, that nullblocs have.
---
Have a nice day.
---
I normally recommend them for anyone that has a question that can't be answered in game with their corp or such. There's a lot of info on Eve out there on websites. Some of it is good. Some of it is way out of date after numerous patches and various changes to the game. At least Eve University updates most of their stuff with patches.
---
I had the same reaction my man hahahaha
---
https://zkillboard.com/system/30000839/
---
Yeah but Eve uni is more focused on teaching new players different types of game mechanics. 
---
I was with Goons for about 2-3 weeks, I had a completely different experience than what you described, so that’s why I have this impression. Also as I stated, all of this advice is from my own personal experience as a relatively new player.
---
I luv u bb
---
Thank you very much for your translation. My English is not very good.
---
Made me giggle like a mangirl lmao, This remind me of my first time playing Eve in 2013, I think that was before the tutorial? That’s why I couldn’t get into the game.
---
You do realize waiting a week or until you get “noticed” isn’t gonna be the best eve experience for a new player right? Not bashing or anything, I understand why that is a thing but I hope you get what I mean..
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;My Thrasher got stuck on a structure, couldn't warp out of a bad NPC fight, and got destroyed before I realized why the warp didn't go through. (I was using the tactical camera.)  
---
&gt;Feels bad, man. :( And it was the one that I killed Dagan with, too, after a long and grueling duel.  
---
&gt;Guess I'll go back to mining and relax for a bit. Thanks for reading my rant.
---
This happens once in a while unfortunately. Worst to me this happened in fucking T5 Abyss, fucking twice. But it also happens with asteroids and various structures, when missioning sometimes it happens when you go to retrieve loot, or even mission objective.
---
So, there are 3 things you can do about it. 
---
First thing you can try, is go into 1st person camera and pull to the very edge of whatever object it is you are stuck in, point yourself in an "open" direction and hit your prop mod. Sometimes you can even somewhat "navigate" like this while inside an object until you find a spot to get out.
---
In cases where loot or mission objective presents a danger for you to get stuck in geometry, you can have a Tractor Beam fitted on your ship if you have a left over high slot. Even tractor Beam I will do for the purpose. Use it to lock onto whatever it is you need and bring it over to you. It will get pulled through the geometry and clear of whatever it needs to be clear off for you to access it.
---
In case where you jsut get stuck while piloting or landing on grid, both of which happen sometimes, the moment you realize you are stuck, turn on your tank, wait 2-3 seconds, close the game and launcher, or simply disconnect on purpose. When you get back into the game it will usually warp you back in a different spot, thus not stuck. If you get stuck in Abyss then things get hairy cause you lose a lot of time from this and may come up against the 20 minute timer. In case you are not in Abyss, things may still shoot at your ship and if it is a lot of fire and you have a weak tank, then you may find your ship still blown up and find yourself in a pod. But it works vast majority of the time unless you wait too long before doing it. So your chances of saving your ship like this are actually pretty good.
---
Last but not least, you don't really need to use tactical cam for missions, use default, makes things much easier to avoid.
---
You must first select "log in" at the top right of the page :)
---
Aye. It's only a matter of time before Goons get rekt and raped.
---
Only a matter of time. Now, it's death by a thousand cuts. 
---
But the blood will flow.
---
One of the best newbro posts ever?
---
People are gonna show up, given there is a finite number of places to go, it's up to you guy's to either make it fun for both sides or try to weaponize boredom, just don't be amazed if people that thrive in that environment then end up showing up all the time aka the very people you complain about.
---
Nah, 2x Faction Balistic, 1x Hiva, 2x Faction DDAs. Or you can just forget the drones and make a cruise focused Rattler, use drones only as additional / suplimentary DPS. You won't miss much but gain a lot more room for tank or utility.
---
Feel that positivity.

Thats bot capital...Smart bombing Macs 10 per system, Gilas and rattlesnakes...yet we turning the eye into Frat when others have been doing this for years....Not that I support botting....but if you are blaming one you should blame the rest of them as well.
---
smartbombs tend to do the job much better and they don't have limited ammo or a long-ass cooldown
---
Anchor bubbles aligned to their citadel and then log out. Log back in. Profit.
---
And unlike DPS, lvl V skills almost a must for most "high level" content...
---
Logistics or 'logi' pilots are basically what you want, and eventually triage capital ships. But yeah logi pilots get massive amounts of pussy
---
Anime pussy
---
cuz damps are op
---
Nah I'm talking about real deal legit pussy, bitches wanna fuck logi bros 😉
---
Can confirm, brought home many women from the bar once they learned I was a logi pilot
---
They certainly are more helpful than lvl 5 on a dps ship. But they’re still not necessary, you’ll just sacrifice some tank in order to fit more cap mods
---
Fuck off
---
thanks, ill maybe look at some other ships as well. I have no clue why, imo rokh looks far better too
---
We must not play the same game
---
Oh hello, what is this feature in-game called "D-Scan"?
---
Battle Royale Eve style?
---
Am new player too. It's called logistics.
---
WoW PVP doesn't have a dedicated tank role because taunting doesn't work against people but you want to have a balance of squishy DPS and some tougher guys for flag carry and stuff. Last time I played (October 2018), that was generally either Vengeance Demon Hunter or less optimally Guardian Druid because of their mobility abilities putting every other tank spec besides maybe Brewmaster to shame and being vastly harder to kill than any other spec with that amount of mobility.
---
This game is like that too.
---
Logistics focuses on either remote armor repair or shield restoration. In practice, they have the same effect but some ships have better armor and others have better shields, so you'd want to check what the fleet commander wants.
---
The T1 cruisers, the biggest thing that I can run (it's going to take a lot of time or money for you to train to a better logistics ship too) focused on logistics have bonuses to transferring capacitor as well, so a group of them transferring to each other will not easily run out of capacitor while they're healing the fleet (and the Thermodynamics skill allows you to frown at the idea that this makes sense). Aside from that, you will be able to fly T1 logistics frigates almost immediately, both hulls have T2 versions, and the Force Auxiliary carriers are logistics-focused.
---
Aside from that, the roles are either debuffs (EWAR), damage, or a mix of the two (tackle ships are light/fast ships with weapons and mobility debuffs, the capacitor destroyers that I have access to can do drone stuff as well as drain capacitor).
---
*Where is this corp?*

Yeah there's a few VNI I've liked recently that are just boating away in a straight line because a rat scrammed them. It must fry them. 400 - 1000km away from center of plex by the time I reach them.

They arent the test 'Deedee Spam Local Bois' alliance anymore. They're trying so hard to become as professional as they can considering they're failing so much this past month. I heard from a friend that spamming local is discouraged already by leadership. And now this. Lol test wellplayed.

Yes, that's why I go on a long explanation of how you setup creates fights with small gangs and why the response you give leads to the outcome you claim to not want namely the gang running as soon as you form and all you responded with is accusations of how they're clearly in it for the kills etc.
---
While in reality, my ideal result would be next time a gang shows you tell you, corp mates, hey guy's let's do caracals they will just run, let's fight them in none hard counter, take a brawling doctrine play can we catch them with combat probes, yeah you will sometimes end up lossing and sometimes end up winning but both sides get to have some fun and play around on grid.

In it for the ganks you mean. As soon as things larger than frigates that get alphaed off the field start showing up even its its just kitchen sink trickling in they flee.

Can't fight kity bullshit with brawling ships. 
---
&gt;yeah you will sometimes end up lossing and sometimes end up winning but both sides get to have some fun and play around on grid.
---
As long as you keep feeding them they won't leave. As soon as you bring a fighting chance they run away. I don't know how much more simple i can make this. You don't need to repeat your lie about wanting good fights again. You don't, you want us to not respond so you can gank frigates and stuff warping to the gate not watching intel. Be honest with it and i wouldn't have such a problem with it.

remember that bugs appear where people are stuck because invisible / badly shaped asteroids.
---
This happened to me once and CCP reimbursed my cynabal. Which I never got stuck with since then (basically don't do the unrated sites). The cynabal was stuck between 2 "snake shaped asteroid" I think, while they were far from me visually, they both were at 0 in the distance and I could not move anywhere.
---
Wut
---
well don't link the software lol
---
Pretty nice dread numbers from panfam. Over 100 for that little fight was impressive. The fighter nerf is fucking great though, for the most part subcaps were able to brawl evenly.

Where are they?

Guys, look at the username before just downvoting.
---
What do you mean with your last sentence, is CCP changing the mechanic to show logis on killmails if they only rep?
---
&gt;  you will be just another noob in the pond
---
This makes me sad, we do everything in our power to make sure this is not true. We message newbeans ASAP, so newBeans speck to a real person and gets invited to the right places. We run three 24/7 fleets, one of which is manned by a caretaker who is paid to listen to and help newbeans. 
---
We do our best to give newbeans a voice we need them to use it, and not fall though the cracks.
---
yes the M00 corp did,  now we have the unkillable concord due to them
---
jita
---
was fun. nice dread form from panfam.
---
Looks a great fight
---
Roasting and denigrating people is what makes TEST, TEST. If leadership is getting demoralized by it then lol fuck them, grow up you nerds.
---
Was a fun night goodfights to all involved. But I'll just say, the tidi in Uemon was gross - CCP really needs to do something about all of the lowsec timers.
---
&gt;and may be against the rules
---
not dying to concord, whether you made it happen or not will get you banned
---
10/10 would explode again

I kinda feel bad for you dudes. All those Goon dreads sitting in your fort watching you die. We thought for sure they'd jump in with you.
---
Renters aren't real people
---
All that said if it works it works. Just because it isn't the best doesn't mean you have to upgrade.
---
Better isk per hour is easy to get by upgrading, but by doing so you are vastly increasing the cost of ship/fit.
---
Fly within your means.
---
If a praxis is affordable and above all WORKS then by all means, stick it out until you can comfortably afford something else.
---
Concord NPC was cheese-able a long time ago(at least more than a decade if I remember right)
---
And for those whom have done it got anti-cheesed by CCP
---
PayPal is available in China. Also, you can buy plex on Steam in China.

We hoped they would too! Could have made it even more interesting.

Almost did but something didn't smell right to us.

This botter has discord listed on his site discord name:

---
Something weird ass feeling tells me hes at least associated either with FRT or with the recent arrivals from Serenity. Could be wrong but, just a feeling .... 
---
Maybe someone fluent in Mandarin could hop on discord with them and see what they can get out of a conversation, if anything. 
---

---
Guess you don't know the official name of taiwan is Republic of China. XD
---
Why would they jump in when you dropped 80 dreads all at once on 15? Kinda boned yourselves there lol
---
To think that this is how you choose to play.
---
Hey bunny! Hope you’re doing well!
---
Nice AAR. It’s always fun to scrap. Until next time ;)

Just a quick question

Does this belong to PIBC or FRT ?

Shit, you might just redeem yourself by shutting the chink bots down, man.
---
The irony is not lost on us... A quality post about how shitposting is essential. 8/8
---
No really, just do it. Regardless of collateral damage. Fuck all the bots.
---
Yes but nothing in this large scale. It's almost as it's the whole coalition a giant blob of bot farmers.
---
The OP couldn't hotdrop his way out of a paperbag......soooooo
---
I think r/2007scape does a decent job.
---
well I am new to capitals, which is why I reached out to alliance mates for this exact question, before answering. and they assured my that only charges, no fuel can be loaded in ships in the ship bay. but as I said, caps is not my expertise yet and I have not one yet to verify myself.
---
However, it is my expertise to estimate economic implications. And supers using JGs for fast moving would be skyrocking the LO prices. Making it a strategic decision that would cost immense amount of isk.
---
The problem is, with this change everyone and their mother would buy a Loki, fit it for cloak and nullification, and run around nullsec completely unstoppable. Probably they’d bring a jamgu or two in case of bait. 
---
There would be no way to bring friends and chase everyone. You can’t bubble them, can’t gatecamp them, can barely track them, can’t bait them (because they tengu will ECM your tackle. And again, bubbles don’t work), and really can’t do anything at all. 
---
So what do you do as a ratter? Your standing fleet isn’t going to bother chasing the roamers, because it’s pointless. You will literally get 0 clues that they’re in system until they decloak. 
---
Maybe, if covops cloaks and nullification were removed from anything bigger than a frigate, you’d have a point. But as it is, a cloaky t3c gang is already untouchable. 
---
Giving them the ability to shut down regions, and suddenly everyone will want to get in on the fun, until all ratting stops. 
---
I mean, if you can think of any way a defense fleet could counter a nullified t3c gang after this change, let me know. But from my experience, the only profitable way to rat/mine would be with a cyno or under a rorqual. 
---
And of course, isk now is worth a million times more than it was. And by complete coincidence, this wouldn’t touch wormhole krabbing, so you’d quickly become very rich. But of course, that has absolutely no effect on your reasons for wanting this /s
---
gf gf
---
Your flair is a great movie!
---
Wow does anyone else see that this image is weird... if you look closely you can see dots embedded inside the image... IS THIS SOME KIND OF SECRET CODE? :komdo:
---
IIRC the counter was added *after* spinning became a player tradition, as a bonus feature in some patch
---
Because fuck people that play more than just Eve right?

---
r/evejobs Minmatar fits are a common flee doctrine everywhere in nullsec. And to be honest, the big blocks don't really interview or give a damn. Very few have standards anymore.
---
Flying logi in incursions give you in general very short queue times but is the most stressful. You can be semi afk or have a good wank in DPS ships while logi demands constat attention. 
---
Also in general people are fine with you dualboxing DPS, but not logi. 
---
Also a 1.2bil scimi with hope-tank is fucking scary.
---
But then again, I think flying logi is the most fun when flying incursions.

Was a dread pilot in this fight. Can confirm it was a damn good fight. Wp unspoken and goons. 👌

Ah so KWG are legacy as they’ve held Omist for quite some time?

Frat is reporting us for spamming local now.

Hm, I thought the fit was like 600?

We gotta fix this dilemma soon.

Cant imagine figting test without local spam &lt;/3

Man, 240p.
---
Way back when it was possible to tank concord, this has happened several times, most notably the Yulai incident. CONCORD has recieved several bufs since then, making the now unkillable and untankable. Even if someone now figures out how to do so now, it is a banable offence, and is considered impossible as things stand anyways.
---
Awesome dread fight?
---
Yikes, dawg

Check [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/17cNu8hxqJKqkkPnhDlIuJY-IT6ps7kTNCd3BEz0Bvqs/pubhtml#) to see that C3 sites range from 41-88m
---
Is it possible that they don't have alliance skins because they need a 64 bit client to do it?  I don't know, it was just a question I asked myself the other day.  If so, then maybe we'll see alliance skins after the 64 bit client drops.
---
Why were no faxes jumped in to save him?
---
It's not like I ever argued that doing L4 missions is better than doing C3 sites. All I said is that I personally use the Praxis for doing L4s, and u/mrelephantae1234 simply inquired about the isk/hr for comparison.
---
Certainly beats "how I make isk quick for plex quick lol" thread #63357
---
It’s an idea. You should not feel stupid for offering an idea up for consideration.
---
I’m not sure that is what you want to do though. It’s like saying “There are now 15 coding standards. That’s too many. We’re going to introduce one that will replace all the other ones! Result: you now have 16 coding standards.” [From XKCD].
---
As soon as there’s ‘another EVE’, you now have two EVEs... I don’t know how that would play out.
---
Join horde. We have cookies and an onboarding class everyday. R/pandemichorde for more info
---
Must be another hidden add-on from CCP on last patch, I suspect. Like this new “Cloaking” thingie I’ve heard so much today.
---
We have seen that CCP have underestimated the player base with some consistency.
---
Titans were supposed to be this super expensive and rare ship. Of course, what do we do: we build hives of them. The mineral requirement is huge but building should take at least twice as long and take 10 times more minerals. That way it would take a lot of physical time to have a fleet of them. The reality being we’d find something to make that work, like we always do.
---
A meta without supers would be interesting. But then you’d have thousands of small ship [battleships and carriers] slogging it out.
---
Could be interesting.
---
Join horde. I mined 200mil in isk as an alpha in just a day. And in 10 days i afforded to plex account. 10/10 can confirm horde is the bomb
---
Unfortunately the "healing UI" is absolutely fucking terrible in EVE.   Imagine in a normal MMO, people that need healing have to actually broadcast that they need healing, you can't see healthbars.  Then you have to lock them up to see if they ACTUALLY need healing, while having a very limited amount of people you're allowed to lock in an unresponsive UI as soon as it's under load.  Then you have to see if they're actually in range to be healed/even on grid/took 5 bomb damage while a REAL guy is getting shit on.
---
I main a healer in basically every MMO I've played, but I can't stand doing it often in EVE.  It feels more like you're fighting the shit UI and your own players more than the enemy, and that's a big nothnx.
---
Him saying ‘it’s cool’ and building an entire new EVE are two different animals entirely.
---
He’s talking to the customers, not just these two guys but through them to us, indicating an openness to the idea, but not committing to making it happen.
---
Corporate speech and thinking, it’s totally a thing.
---
So I've been winning eve for a few years but there was something cathartic about running C3's.  
---
You say you run them in a pair. How rough are the data and relics?  
---
I used to run them in a T3C pair and the first few runs were pretty hairy but after about 2 weeks they were routine. Your fit does slightly more dps, is considerably cheaper, and has better range.
---
Well, I intentionally removed the name, but it's not like everyone and their mother doesn't have a spy in TEST and can see who posted it and that he is literally a teenager.
---
exactly what I've been telling them
---
CCP should just flag the botters with fat bounties.  That way the players solve the problem themselves, while also giving players something fun and challenging to do.
---
Am I thinking of gilas being changed then? They used to run heavies? Because i remember gila's using geckos to some degree of success
---
Yeah i looked up what it takes to do them and the reward and I've been grinding my gallente standing up all night now. Seems really worth it.
---
they can't afford them anymore, all there shinny thing got popped.
---
He propably didn't realize he was in high sec. Noone would suicide gank you with a prot on purpose no matter what you're carrying, there are better ships for that.
---
Maybe they have some sorts of alarm system?
---
Is this system next to lowsec?  There’s a chance he was running around looking for targets and forgot he was in highsec.  Safety on red... now he’s dead.
---
I disagree.
---
It’s not hard to do as in: this is what it takes to make it happen. As I said: you’re not going through BUD/S just so you can press F1 afterwards.
---
But: competent leadership, competent ship management AND people with a *willingness to follow orders*, those are essentials.
---
The most competent military leader gets absolutely nowhere if the vast host of his army tells him: “You can just go ahead and fuck yourself, we’re staying in, we’re not moving beyond the chow line.”
---
The handful of roles have to be competent, for sure, and the newbie crew does not have that. But the handful of competent leaders, without people willing to stick around and work towards a common goal, are not going to get very far.
---
Try being a soldier in an army an the drill instructor says “You’re a worthless piece of shit!” and the guy saying: “Oh, so you don’t mind me not joining the rest of the worthless pieces of shit who are going to lay down their life for, whatever bullshit they came up this time to make me sit in a shit hole for 6 months with guys trying to kill me who I’ve never seen? Did I get that right? Well ok then. You go right ahead, sir, and please take this gun and do it yourself.” That’s not going to work. Drill instructor does not want that.
---
Your F1 monkey may not garner a lot of respect but there’s not going to be too many huge fleet fights if nobody shows up to have them. Right?
---
So, that idea, versus newbies who don’t know each other, who don’t know the mechanics and have no unit cohesion, I can never see that becoming a success unless and when the total randomness of the universe goes ‘ok, well, you rolled a 20, you win!’
---
Gilas got changed to where they could only launch a severely limited drone pool (bandwidth was capped at 50 or something) but those drones did the damage of a full flight of drones so long as it was thermal / kinetic. Geckos only deal thermal kinetic so they were the only drone Gilas needed to do absolutely ridiculous amounts of damage because it was dealing damage closer to a full flight of geckos. It was better than other ships because those ships could launch double the geckos but they still did less damage lol.
---
That’s exactly what would happen. FC would start target calling and you’d have them go *POP POP POP* in quick succession. It’s their first fleet fight. A fleet is more than just a bunch of ships flying in close proximity. Unit cohesion is all important.
---
Same accusation, just like USA said Iraq has WMD.
---
&gt; He's probably just chipping away at some dark ochre in a Thorax with T1 lasers.

Harsh! True, no doubt, but harsh :-)

---
joecuster is probably just a Twat all the time, you just happened notice it here.
---
Ok, so as many people in this thread have said, the 'healer' archetype in Eve is the Logi. That's short for Logistics, because for some reason CCP named the Tech 2 versions of these ships Logistic vessels, even though they don't do any actual logistics in the real sense. They are repair auxiliaries.
---
You start off with the frigate (ship class) skill for the race you start with; don't get too hung up on racial choices they mean nothing in the long run. You can (&amp; almost certainly will) train all races ships.
---
Caldari and Minmatar are Shield Logi; they use remote shield transfers to replenish other ships shields, and are themselves shield tanked.
---
Amarr and Gallente are armour based; remote armour repairers and are themselves armour tanked.
---
Pick a race to start with, and you'll have 6 frigates you can fly for that race. 1 is a basic logi. The Caldari Bantam, the Minmatar Burst, the Amarr Inquisitor and the Gallente Navitas.
---
My advice would be to pick one that looks cool to you, and then start looking for a Corp to fly with. Pickup fleets don't happen in the wider ecosystem of Eve; you'll need a Corp - even in faction warfare, which is the closest equivalent Eve has to pickup and play content, people are highly conscious of operational security.
---
like 15 years ago you could
---
I dont get this
---
Fighting for things that truly matter!
---
Lmao
---
Go to division 1 if u want to be a real healer/support.
---
Division 2 have ZERO build diversity!
---
If there is bot, how can you still get VNI kill. VNI is the ship that is easy to escape when hostile is showing in local.
---
And i believe that is why people use VNI to do ratting, instead of Dominix.
---
And badly translated talk? Errr can i google translation or otger similar app? These are Chinese, you are expecting Chinese people can speak fluent English?
---
Me personally believe CCP is doing their job. Its not your concern whether fraternity is botting. If fraternity is a botting alliance, fraternity will get banned from CCP. False accusation, so, downvote to you.
---
Its 4 interesting when kills I found today
---
Good one.  8/10
---
Like episode 1 or 2
---
The real question is who is the Sub and who is the Dom, Goons or Unspoken?  I would say Goons are the Sub, but Unspoken can't even keep there renter (possibility  their Gimps) the Lazerhawks under control.
---
so I would get banned if I shot someone 1 second before the server shuts down?
---
Well see the last kill wont drop sht cause its a battery. The comet was a lowsec mofo who got lost in a wh and the rattlesnake was a stupid pilot for going in a wormhole with that ship. Tldr nothing new. Just smooth brains doing their thing. Boooo
---
TV show, Fresh Off the Boat
---
They DO get banned... and then they just create more bot characters.
---
Bonus points if yall can guess who I was.
---
downvote to *YOU*
---
Thanks. I am usually an asshole here, but still love to learn new things.
---
As someone who has done this before... he probably didn't realize he was in highsec.     
---
Sometimes I go through a wormhole and see a bunch of ships on dscan and for a moment I get excited until I realize I'm in highsec.
---
Whats the time difference in site completion from using different ammos?
---
This. There's some bits of GSF that periodically decide having a huge security hole in their Comms net might be fun. Those bits can go fuck themselves.
---
Are you saying CCP is not doing their jobs. So you have to stand in here say CCP plz ban them all, because tax rate is 100%, and I found they are botting? Why dont you talk about TAPI's botting rorqual in Esoteria?
---
No need for the afterhand payment ;)
---
Pandemic Horde has a series of videos and presentations.
---
Companion app?
---
I'd say it went *okay* for an unexpected 800 man brawl.
---
999 upvotes and i dont want to ruin it
---
Well actually he gets Eve because it is now a PvP theme park and if they want their prey to fleet up to fight then they have to be able to earn ISK to do that.   Simple stuff, please keep up.
---
Isn’t dropping a structure your consent to PVP now?
---
Just hijacking this comment: 
---
There are 2 noob friendly ways of mining profitable gas solo. Both require a venture (train mining frigate as high as possible, that's the only skill you need. Iirc gas harvesting should be either 1 or 5 because it only unlocks the t2 harvester, which alphas can't use. 
---
Some useful links: 
---
Gas mining in general
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Gas_cloud_harvesting
---
Wormhole gas mining
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_Gas_Sites#Gas_sites
---
What to mine for best profits
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/ore/gas.html
---
So when playing solo and not be part of a big nullsec alliance, go for low sec or wormhole. You need a scanning ship for both. 
---
In lowsec gas only spawns in certain areas. Check the first link. One type of lowsec gas is pretty much worthless, the other one is what you want. Check the 3rd link. 
---
When going to wormholes never warp with your scanning ship to site. As soon the first ship starts warp to a wormhole gas site, a timer of 15-20 min starts before rats appear. 
---
So you want to warp there with a venture first so you get up to 20 min of gas mining. The rats are scary and will kill your venture instantly so keep an eye open. 
---
There's one site that has towers at pre spawn. Look it up at the 2nd link and never warp there. It'll kill you. 
---
Also there's special gas (c320 and c540) sometimes people were there and only took the c320. If that is missing and there are no rats, you can mine all the rest for Max profit. 
---
Feel free if you have more questions. I do it a lot.
---
&gt;Are you saying CCP is not doing their jobs. So you have to stand in here say CCP plz ban them all, because tax rate is 100%, and I found they are botting? Why dont you talk about TAPI's botting rorqual in Esoteria?
---
There can be more than one group of people who are running bots.
---
This isn't a thread about a different group. This is a thread about *this group*, which is located in wicked creek.
---
Yep! I have no idea what this chair spinning thing is about, 'cause we were spinning long ago and *I was there*™ for spin counter being added to the game.
---
Well see its all about structure. PH still obey PL because they gave PH the alliance structure to function the way it functions now. Thats the problem of small time alliances that think they can function without the aid of established and experienced nullsec alliances. They'll always stay small time without aid because the alliance level structure isnt there. Now PH is one of the dominant entities in eve but they still follow PL due to something we call idk "Return of favor"? So yeah thats about it.
---
Personally, I’d like a new server with some alternative balances to the game.
---
A new server with no skill injectors, reduced max corp/alliance size/blue list size.
---
No alpha accounts allowed. 
---
Rorquals getting nerfed to be just massive boost ships, 
---
A few tweaks could make the game quite different and appeal to people who left the game for a lot of current issues (cap balance, injectors, everything owned by mega coalitions, etc)
---
But only if this server exists alongside the original. A sort of osrs to rs3 with each one having different focuses.
---
So yes the"forgot iwas in highsec" angles. But have you heard of alcohol?
---
yeah and CCP cannot track them down?
---
If you kill someone in 1 sec before DT please let me know what kind of ship you flying...I mean to be able to kill someone before reset you need something that can kill in less than 5 seconds but CONCORD might show up before that and kill you anyways :)
---
Arguably no, a screenscraping bot can still register your ship appearing on a ship-only tab and initiate warp before you decelerate from your own warp and can bubble.
---
At a glance I thought that was a malformed pancake
---
Cracks... Forming...?
---
&gt; yeah and CCP cannot track them down? And I have see a lot of TAPI reddit bots clicking downvote button on my origin comment. Great!
---
I'm downvoting your posts.
---
Waiting warmly for you to call me a TAPI bot.
---
I should be clear, I'm not advocating for this specific change. I just want something to change and this seems like a somewhat decent place to start. Also, if you're worried about a fleet of cloakys roaming your space, A dirty gate with a couple of ceptors for fast tackle is terrifying to jump through to. You probably won't catch everything, but even grabbing 2-3 lokis can force a fleet to either engage you or lose 2-3 bil in ships, and a not insignificant portion of their fleet. Aside from that lokis probably do need something of a nerf, they are currently too easy to fit, particularly the nullified version where you don't need to make the sacrifices you probably should need to. As far as tengus being used for ECM, that is something I haven't seen since the ECM nerf, as even the non-nullified version have very little tank. Aside from that you may see people changing the ships they use to rat in. It's not like a nullified T3 can always just warp to a site and tackle someone. Aside form the fact that if there is only a delay to local still means people are using combats to find you, there is still a minimum 5 sec delay before you can tackle something after decloaking in A T3. Add to that an additional 3-5 second targeting speed an an attentive ratter has enough time to if not warp out, at least align to a safe ad overheat their 100mn AB. A 100mn cruiser can be difficult to hold down without at least webs on it if it is doing more then just orbiting a site at 30. There is also the possibility people running sites differently, If you fit say some cruise missile BS then you can not only run a site from significantly further away, making it much harder for something to slowboat cloaked to you, but it also give you the option to MJD away if the hunter is relying on a point to hold you down. It is hard to fit a web, scram, and point to a nullified T3 and still have a decent tank after all.
---
I have NOT specifically point to YOU.
---
I’m not really saying anything to be honest, just trying to be an internet smartass!
---
That’s a good point actually! There were some really great videos done back in about 2006, a dude called Ugluuk in particular made some cracking ones.  I can see the links to the vids on old forums, but they don’t work.  Is there a way to refine the dud into something that works?
---
Still applies my dude, also twitch tells you if it is muted because of copyrighted music
---
Dude, every FC in 0.0 is going to want to give you a blowjob to get you into their fleet!
---
This is one of those times I wish I could upvote something twice.
---
Cheaper than a moracha.
---
Yeah! Thats the issue of demoralization. Its DEFINITELY NOT the leadership who has called other alliances retarded, leaderships constant bitching and leadership pissed off so they blame the line member. 
---
No its the :thonking: emoji thats making people demoralised
---
So you are a dishonest man?
---
Looking into now.  our focus has been at war atm. Please if anyone see something suspect while going into Winterco space please message me in game. Same name as reddit account. Ty
---
That Y-2 titan's fit though.. omg..
---
Noon here - what does TAPI mean?
---
I mean in theory it should work with a shuttle that's like 1% in structure or something?
---
Depends on your group. Usually they start at 700-800 jita sell. But if you bling them to provide more links they easily go beyond 1b
---
😂🤣😂🤣 Dude i was high too during history class in high school but are you really so stupid that you believe this? Irish people most certainly paid money to become slaves of the railroad companies in 19th century america, just the same as people from nepal are paying to he slaves today in Qatar. Read a fucking newspaper.
---
I guess you could say they came from out of your sight
---
Welcome, new logi friend. Train the frigate logi first and join some spectre fleets. Then train cruiser logi. When you have that search yourself a corp/alliance you like. Logi pilots are always welcome everywhere.
---
No, silly.  *Everyone* is a spai.
---
I never understood this sentence. Does it means that if someone suicide gank someone else must be killed by concord in all the cases?
---
It's next to Amoderia which is a lowsec island.
---
Maybe he logged in and thought he was in 0.4 next door and accidently ganked himself.
---
yes
---
bois do too &lt;3
---
Fun! Saw it on zkill yesterday, wondered if there's gonna be a vid.
---
Twitch auto detect copyright bot is sometimes a bit greedy (I'm talking in general, I haven't seen this particular case yet)
---
all great advice here but let me chip in with some skipped facts that are different from other mmos:
---
*  if you focus exclusively on logi - ypu won't be able to do solo content and most of the times be dependent on your corp for some sort of pve related income. 
---
*  as opposed to other mmos where the healers usually have high survivability skills for solo, here you won't accomplish much as solo healer. You will be focused and killed. You can get by in certain setups buy straight up will be dead
---
*  your only defenses are your range and, at higher levels, your resists and your small signature. 
---
*  for pve - unless you are going for incursions, there is not much place for a dedicated healer in a group that does pve, unless everyone is at very low skill levels. It is usually more time/isk efficient to run some sort of remote repair/remote capacitor setup with a combat ship as the combat ships don t usually gain that much efficiency by fitting exclusively for damage. Might change for larger fleets but then, outside incursions, people don't employ larger fleets for pve
---
*  the logis get the pussy, we all love logibros is a conspiracy of dps people to make more dudes play logi which is a thankless, hard, responsible job so they can enjoy their wrecking shot numbers. Nah just kidding - or am i?
---
Logi is fun, but get some basic skills in and then specialize, is all im sayinh

0/10.

StainGuy of all people should know a good shitpost needs to be at least partly true, and not just any random bullshit.
---
Stop calling it that
---
I don't know that anyone's mentioned this yet, but have you considered that he probably didn't realize he was in HS.
---
that's a heckin' good story neighborino
---
very nice
---
I did a double take with your username thinking I had posted already.
---
And here is a little Chinese bot that these guys use. Its either FRT or PBIC bot, very possibly both, check it out
---
In my prime, and when I do played, my Corp was a small not-so-elite squad of a few bitter vets and a lot of newbros. Our biggest fleets would maybe approach 40 people, and that was with a few  random allies in the mix, but foolishly half of that. We would regularly mix it up with larger, "better" fleets and either win, or break even.
---
For us, the deciding factor was drilling newbies, and good FCs. We were about as far from serious business as possible, but we still would take the time to take newbies under our wing, talk about what matters in combat, and run ultra-small 2-5 man ops to get them accustomed to combat stress and following instructions. Those really small ops were almost always disasterous, but throw just enough competent people in with them to make up for the gaps with reps and calls, and it's amazing what can be accomplished. Even our (many) losses were hilarious affairs that left everyone looking forward to the next fight. 
---
I really miss it, and wish I still had the time for it. Small gang is where it's at.
---
Welcome to EVE - the never ending cycle of something being OP after a revamp and than being nerfed. It has always been like that and nothing is really changing.
---
This is solid gold.
---
thanks
---
Are you being serious?
---
&gt; Small gang is where it's at.
---
I never have as much fun as when in a small fleet hamming it up. Riotous fun. If you lose one of your baker’s dozen frig or cruiser, who gives a shit. Get another one, carry on.
---
A lot of EVE is chemistry. Find the right people and it’s a shit ton of fun. Corporate strategy, EVE politics. Yeah yeah, sure mate. Having fun while flying among the stars, that’s the real deal.
---
Then, meeting people at Fanfest. Beautiful :-).

&gt;he probably didn't realize he was in highsec.

Idk about you, but it shouts high self-confidence all over to me. :D

Spend 9 months in 0.0. You go back to hi-sec. Shit your pants because there’s 50 neuts in system :-).
---
god damn... keep goign.... gonna nut
---
Never underestimate the side effects of a good slosh op :-).
---
yeah, it's between a 0.4 and another 0.5
---
Our little corner of New Eden is what eve looks like without Supercaps. The blocs don't need them beacuse they have them beacuse they leave them at home for their umbrella, and we don't have enough to use them outside of shooting structures. Welcome to a more fun version of eve :)
---
Quick google shows that it means Test. Hard to keep track of all the nullsec fuckwads, eh?

I'm a new player and I have no idea what I'm talking about, but maybe he wasn't paying attention to the security level of the system?
---
A guy was going to frag my Hulk one day. He brings a shit fit Raven. Just enough oomph for one good Alpha, but not good enough. The Hulk was tanked [obviously] and he couldn’t break it before Concord came along to tear him a new asshole.
---
I got the hauler to loot his wreck and then salvage it. I got 2 million ISK out of that. He got bupkis :-).
---
Up load this to that new eve wallpaper aggregator site thingymajig
---
They've teased killmails 2.0 during either the last (or previous) FanFest. As far as I know, the new character progressions UI stuff somewhat related to the work on killmails 2.0 as well. I do not think there has been a more detailed update since the tease.
---
It's a known feature on the roadmap, but we haven't heard about it in quite a while. Same with weapon tiericide (and I guess a ton of other stuff).
---
I done more than beat Concord. I beat Eve
---
Depends who you ask
---
Oh, please. Just spare us the BS.
---
Why is this an indicator that they're bots?
---
Why can't it just be a deterrent from doing pve stuff?
---
Concord has on a few occasions in the past [at least once that I’m aware of].
---
Of course, I don’t know if it still applies, that causes ALL of Concord in a 5-jump-range to come and kick your ass. You are not supposed to survive that much punishment.
---
Dude forgot or didn´t recognize he was in highsec. You haven´t played Eve until you´ve done this at least once.
---
Wait, there is an actual spin counter?
---
You’re just the next “I left EVE a few years ago and I’m now going back. Is [entity.name] still in [location.name]? What’s the current region you’re in and are you still flying [ship.name] with [doctrine.name]?” story.
---
Come back, man. We loved having you!
---
Ho god I cant wait to see CCP members with Destiny and friends (Greek, Trainwreck etc...) in IRL section anoying people and being embarassements in public to be finaly taken away by the cops at the end.
---
No we don't.
---
I have always loved this picture and ones like it.
---
You don't know? You could spent 2 seconds to look and see that it's been mentioned like a dozen times before you commented.
---
This is a moot point because this is only true for a short time. In the first fight the 20 might win but 10 fleets in and the 100 guys will win easily.
---
as soon as the 100 guys learn how to F1 the primary the 20 guys are fucked.
---
Yeyeyeyeyeyeye
---
It's a bit late for that.
---
Yes. However, I hear that you'll also show up on allied lossmails as well if you rep them but they still die.
---
When they are no longer newbies they will win. But not while they’re newbies.
---
We were talking about newbies. I can’t be sold on the idea that newbies, who don’t know what end of the boat the warp drive is at, are going to defeat an experienced fleet.
---
Nature finds a way!
---
But we do have a lot bigger ones!
---
Iaptean Titans are 400-500KM long, they were created by 4 Empires.
---
Most people have covered what healing involves in terms of ships, and the fact that everyone wants healers. As a logi pilot, I also want to add a little about how it feels to fly logi and what it involves in terms of gameplay.
---
1. It is exclusively a fleet thing (I guess you expected that).
---
2. It tends to be a very active (and reactive) role. It involves managing a lot of incoming information (most notably multiple people asking for repairs). DPS for example tends to follow FC (fleet commander) orders and shoot the main target, while in logi you tend to have a more incoming streams of information to handle, and more decisions to make.
---
3. You are pressing more buttons ingame than most other roles (you have more chat channels open, you activate more modules, manage more targets, and sometimes you manually pilot as well).
---
4. In PvE fights you have a more relaxed job of keeping everyone alive. In PvP you are often fighting to buy time on the field (your friends will fall eventually, and sometimes, keeping each of them alive for an extra 10 seconds wins you the fight).
---
5. You are often communicating with your FC to let him know how fast you are losing ships, and if you can hold incoming damage (most FCs focus on how to break the enemy, and have less time to assess the state of their own fleet).
---
6. Certain skills are very powerful to max out (lvl 5 racial cruiser, lvl 5 fitting skills... we're not talking about T2 ships here as you start your logi career). They are not required to start flying logi, but you will want a few LVL 5s mostly due to capacitor issues. Good skills can make the difference between being able to run your reps virtually indefinitely and having them die after 2 minutes on certain fits (especially solo curiser logi).
---
7. Frigate logi is super fun :D. High speed, low margin for error, manually piloting a lot.
---
It is an exciting and intrinsically rewarding role, you will build a reputation for yourself as a logi pilot within your corp. Yet the game doesn't really reward you on the scoreboards (zkill), at least for now.
---
The language I or anyone else uses doesn't seem to matter as you guys don't listen. It's not as if we haven't been asking you guys to use them for the last few years is it....oh wait...it is!
---
Funny ghow the two biggest ones are also the two most useless.
---

---
Isn't [this](https://i.imgur.com/u6ck6iJ.jpg) missing
---
Nope, doesn't work since months ago. They just dock back up until botter logs main to kill them.
---
That was high-tech in 2005.
---
Very likely didn't realise.  I've done the same a long time ago.  Chased a brutix into highsec with my drake and attacked him on the ingate.  Realised it was highsec the very next second, and felt like a moron.
---
Yeah as I said, it would take a couple weeks. Obviously it wont be the case from day 1. But with decent enough training 100 newbies with a good FC will absolutely trash 20 "experienced" newbies with a good FC. The main difference in these sorts of fights are SP and ships, thats why experienced players can fight outnumbered; not player skill. 
---
Its an actual absolute no-brainer.
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98584538/page/4/

I've been killing these guys with log off traps for 4 months but gave up. Can't win that war.

Depends on the sec status. They'll take way too long in lower hisec.

I think you might be an old member of karma fleet, try making an application now. At the end of your application it says, “Karma fleet is currently not recruiting, and accepting only selected application. Please hang out in our public chat and be active until a recruiter contacts you.” That’s why.
---
I took this nice [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bftgoo/sketched_a_soltueur_titan_itsybitsy_erebus_for/) by u/-razernc\- and added the poster for scale: [https://imgur.com/a/UyhYysZ](https://imgur.com/a/UyhYysZ) 
---
Is that what you're looking for?
---
What annoyed me is some bots are programmed not to leave the tower/citadel if there is a bubble on the overview. If its a VNI bot sometimes you can catch them by logging off a sabre in line with the citadel, because they wont initiate warp until the drones are in. I gotta test this more though.
---
Several problems. You can easily counter whoever is in it. After most 1v1 battles even the winner isnt able to fight anymore due to heat /armor/hull damage especially with frigates up to cruisers. Only full kite fits might be able to leave unscathed. Also you can bring in a toon and just camp the gate outside with a stronger ship
---
Obviously I'm assuming the newbies still want to fight and win. You're bringing so many random external factors to justify yourself.
---
"what if they just dont turn on guns"
---
"what if they just run away"
---
Yeah then they'll lose, vOv. A meteor could also land on the FCs house, they'll lose then too. 
---
The premise is that you have 100 newbies that want to fight, they just dont have "experience". The reality is after a couple of weeks, they are pretty close to being a decent line-member player-skill wise, that's just the reality. The main issue with actual new players (as someone whos actually dealt with hearding new players) is that they have shit SP, that's the actual main barrier, everything else is superficial and is easily trained and explained.
---
They might not be quite qs fast and efficient but "experienced" players cant make up a 100 to 20 deficit with that. The skill ceiling for being a line member is really fucking low and doesn't take very long to reach. What "experienced" players bring is skillpoints and better ships, not superior player skill. 
---
Why are we out here acting like basic fleet behavior is super hard, this is actually mind-blowing.
---
Ingame and usable
---
The models were a little ont he expensive side but the problem they had was the shipping cost as per usual. CCP don't seem to grasp that we are more than willing to pay for goods, what we are not willing to do is pay twice the goods costs in shipping though.
---
Models don't exist any more ingame.
---
Then downvote HARDER!!!!
---
FTP opened a huge door for botters
---
666
---
I rephrase: is that what you’re asking for/suggesting?
---
Hell ya. It appears after like 5 spins and counts em for you.  Iirc it flashes blue at 10k or some such.
---
Only works if bubble can be outside dscan range of all bots. It is also a massice time investment to kill a single vni.
---
so you'd get 2 killmails? I guess everyone would want to play logo after this update 😅
---
You wound me.
---
It's a cunning long term plan. He follows you about welping an endless series of proteus in hi-sec until you stop paying attention and accidentally jump into a 0.4 system. 
---
Then wham! He toasts you.
---
I am a KarmaFleet recruitment officer and I can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that what you have just said is not true.
---
Since how long is that not true if I may ask? Because I can assure you that 2 months ago I had to join asccee because of that problem.
---
That's why you always have safety on yellow... unless of course you are suicide ganking on purpose.
---
The siege of yulai :)
---
So youre saying that because he has 40b in Eve assets he isnt new to streaming? That makes no sense.
---
Yeah it's clearly the line members emojis that have put your fleet numbers in the toilet and not the monotonous routine of senslessly feeding to Fraternity day after day.
---
2 months ago we did not have a functioning website, we did in fact have the hang out in chat program. That is no longer the case. The day after we got new site up we had over 200 applicants to sift through, and we have been steady going over every single applicant since.  Website works.
---
As far as the message at end of application. That has NEVER happened. That is because for almost a year it was impossible to fill out an application on the old site. It only became possible when the new site was finished.
---
Have a nice day!
---
Are they serious? I doubt they didn't have any MD on them. Why not switch into those ships unfit thema and then take the loot?
---
I miss this sometimes then I remember what playing the game when you've got supers and no motivation to rat for pvp is like.
---
Sorry y'all just one set of naked yelling tribesmen yelling at one another to me.

Except the bees, who are naked *striped* yelling tribesmen.

So im gunna run devils advocate and think hey, maybe you care about this
---
But just look at that killboard dude. Thats it. Thats proof. No in game talk. None of that, look at this here. Thats it. Go about and chose what to do next.
---
I hate the animosity of the playerbase right now. Its so incredibly fucked some players are making propaganda to "rid the chinese menace", wtf???! *nonironically*, especially because im personally from the US where this shit goes wild nowadays. It sucks, because you have these neeted fucks going ham with it. Ive heard on some fleetcomms someone say "chinks" and it really dissapointed me (dude got yelled at about it, which gives brevity).
---
This shit HAS to stop. You need to stop this botting behavior, because it incites all kinds of hatred to the playerbase because we dont want our game like that. Racist assholes are just racist assholes anyways, but now its a weird place where all that botting animosity is thrown right onto the chinese playerbase and makes for a horrible experience for them coming in to tranquility, and chinese players in general who are already here.
---
Every kind of person you can imagine could be a botter, and now all of a sudden its painted the chinese playerbase with that connotation. We have so many new nerds transferring over, and instead of the reaction of 2000 new players actually bringinf life to the game, it was met with bigotry, and (rooted kind of in real terms), fear that our server is going to shit.
---
So i'm going to ask you to stop saving face and just work this out internally. Thats whats going to happen, people will just instead come onto public forums and make it more blatant about the botting going on (this is eve, this is the metagame). 
---
From then on its only going to get alot uglier for everyone involved.

I never thought Stainguy participated in Battle of Reach

Fun fact: to attain the palentine titan. (The big ass avatar "yellow buttplug") you would have to have mined all the moons in delve since the start of eve to aquire 10% of the minerals needed to build its clone bay. 
---
The more you know.
---
My eyes got cancer from looking at that. Cool enough concept, can't tell what anything is unless you have previous experience with the ship before.
---
So many good memories
---
rlml sacrilege could do it i think. I recall someone doing them like that.
---
Well that will give the art team something to do other than skins.
---
you need a 500 000 isk ship and fit to start scanning. everything else is just upgrades.
---
keep cheap and you wont mond losing it.
---
dont run sites with loot in your ship, drop it in a can at a safe spot, bookmark it.
---
deposit as often as possible in npc stations
---
Ive already aired my issues with the botting. Theres alot of things that just get more fucky.
---
You kick them and blacklist from being blue. Ok so now they get rid of the isk and sp of the toon wash the money and go to some other renter corp in or out of your group. They could go to drone space branch PB omist or feyth. New character sam sp same isk. Keeping up on it is damn near impossible. Sometimes you cant tell. I dont have the same tools CCP had to find out whats fucky. Right? Renters are for people who want to buy space and live there. Its not a usual scrubbing of spies or suspect people like it would be in Frat propper.
---
The bar to join a renter alliance is low. Its bren low its always low. Low enough litterally anyone can apply and join in a day.
---
Then another issue blues dont often come in contact with these bots. Bots are the types that dock up instantly if neut. Alot of people dont go to renter areas. That are blue anyways. Renters are skidish some times. 
---
You can go back on my reddit posts ive been sayin it for months now this shit ruins this fucking game. Ive been over and over and over asking them to let us know if you see something suspect the issues with being a huge coalition and trying to look over renters. Its just not feasible. Not to winterco legacy imperium deadco ncpl and Skillu
---
Its to big of an issue to have us police renter space constantly. And you know whats the most fucked up. Youll never get rid of them. Hell i think bots in null is smaller than im HS.
---
Join an alliance
---
I see what you are trying to say with this, I think. Next time just stay on topic and try not to force the extra insult in, it will sound better and make more sense. Good try thou, you are doing a great job trying!
---
Damn how do I always miss the big fun, god damn timezones..
---
Hahaha happened to me when i deathcloned to jita then logged off for the night. When i logged back in the next day i forgot i was in jita. Saw a sht ton of neuts. Reported "600+ neuts in system *home system*" on intel. Everyone panicked in alliance. Then after that i realized i was in jita. Was hazed and given the title "The one who cried jita local" never went back to jita ever again. 
---
So note. Always have a out of corp jita alt to avoid such titles.
---
And yes i caused a rage ping and form cause of this. Lolzzz
---
I wholeheartingly agree, thank you for the honesty here.
---
So, if i understand this correctly, you are advocating for higher ratting tax overal. 
---
Because if you give us a way to fix local for ISK, everyone and their grandmothers will just pay isk to stay safe and eerything is back to normal in a day or two. 
---
Nullseccer btw.
---
Will you cry to your mom when the bans don't get lifted?

untill you used your CSM intel for personal and alliance benefits.

Hi mom

Then you should have stated as such, not "At the end of your application".  There was a time that we had issues with our site, but those times are long gone now, so the best bet is to go to our website, https://karmafleet.org , and submit an application!
---
No Destiny is shit at League, I say this as a longtime viewer
---
There's lots of situations where ships can get one-shot. Easiest example would be a tornado blowing up a frigate that's standing still. In a system with a low security rating, you'd have a nice, long window to do it so that DT occurs before CONCORD show up.
---
I think it has to do with tidi making it easier for reinenforcments to reach the frontlines

I love you Wally

Evrytime i see Avatar, i simply cannot resist the thought, how would it feel to put my dick in that amazingly shaped conus?

He is an NPC. A DED NPC as a matter of fact.
---
Unspoken is burning the renter lands of NC. while Goons have deployed some sigs and squads up north to do the same thing and are working with Unspoken towards a shared goal. Panfam has deployed to defend the renters and we're getting great brawls like this out of it.
---
If an account is found to be bitting, is it merely banned? If it isn't already, maybe all transactions should be reversed too? Aka, stop them from just spooling up a new one and resuming where they left off.

Unspoken, JAG and Lazerhawks gained sov in E.R when the DRF empire collapsed. Going against the usual etiquette of the Dronelands they refused to blue all the newly formed rental empires that replaced the old one run by Russians Legion of Death, primarily so they would have content on their doorstep. BOT rental alliance (owned by NC.) have an inner core of corps who don’t pay rent and are the supposed police force for their space who go under the banner of Order66. Consisting of around a thousand alts this group provide content for the much smaller but better skilled PvP alliances in E.R. 
---
However a few months back the destruction of a BOT Sotiyo in The Spire by the barbarians of E.R seems to have been a ‘final straw’ for rental overlords NC. who have decided that the noisy abusive neighbours in E.R need to be evicted. Teaming up with Pandemic Horde they began killing Unspoken structures in E.R. However in retaliation the barbarians of E.R have been purging The Spire of I-Hubs and structures with the help of Goons (who had deployed a sig of theirs in an originally unrelated attack on BOT to harm NC. rental income).
---
Copyright mechanics was already present in 2001 o.O

But yeah it is very odd that he shows up as a killmail with fitted equipment. A shitfit.

why does it say "nioggur" tho

lol no.

Do the Chinese alliances still focus on using huge numbers of Titans with T2 modules?

Kill millions of people of starvation?

Yeah. Only t2? Laaaame

You may need to get your eyes checked 'cos that is in fact a malformed pancake.

Yes, absolutely. This has happened before.

Um
---
So are they officially at war now ?
---
But yellow doesn't prevent you from shooting ships in hisec, i think?
---
IIRC green presents all actions that'd give you a suspect timer.      
---
 yellow prevents criminal timer (like podding) but let's you perform actions that make you a suspect and trigger concord. 
---
I'm a bit rusty on hisec mechanics though.
---
The ultra Safe ultra isk null-sec ratting dens wont be affected anyway. It will only affect who already isnt as safe in his space and therefore the big alliances will get bigger. Have fun hunting when every ratter is under a capable super umbrella
---
Yellow prevents you from getting concordokken in HS. You can still go suspect though.

[Upon some googling](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Safety_settings), there seems to be three non-concordokkenable offences the yellow safety stops you from doing: activating smartbombs in LS, unprovoked podding in LS, and giving assistance (e.g. repping) someone who has done either. This is assuming you stay in LS/NS for the duration of the criminal timer, if you jump into HS with active criminal timer, you cannot warp off the gate or jump back due to the timer.
---
I'm fairly certain that the whole *point* of yellow safety is that you can't be concorded with it on.
---
There is one over in serpentis space iirc
---
So what are you saying there? PL is number one, NCdot #2, and PH three? Cause if you think Horde is at the top of panfam, I'd get out the popcorn
---
You missed an easy one tho:  so remember back a couple weeks Simone posted a discord log of him saying something like “fuck line members i don’t care what they think”    I was totally expecting that to surface here
---
Otherwise nice job these always make me chuckle
---
Is there any reason why ccp can’t recognise bots and ban the accounts? From a software point of view surely there must be obvious signs when an account is being run by a bot program?
---
I know botting means more isk, but do the people running them make real world money?
---
By "refusing to blue all the newly formed rental empires" you mean you only blued up 2 out of 3?
---
Careful with the fake news to gain Reddit sympathy, they often backfire.
---
In (big) fights, when a fleet has dedicated tackle (e.g. T3s, Arazus, Huginns), are the interceptors used only for warp-ins/warp-outs?
---
Very very nice!
---
Probably the "entire Microsoft Arsenal " pasta. 
---
*Why do I know such stuff?*
---
Wait, which two are those?
---
&gt; the last kill wont drop sht cause its a battery
---
it is an SMA btw
---
A bunch of people got warnings so it's not a big deal. I think they were just offended or something idk.
---
Judging by sheer size, i would say, it's the Independence Day Invasion Mothership, which was easily destroyed by a lowly contemporary human technology, which makes it totally useless in comparison to any other. And the second one would be Guild freighter from Dune, which is essentially glorified weaponless hauler.
---
watch the zkill guide on how to fly the pancake
---
Safety red, a man of culture I see.
---
Actually you are 100% right didnt think about the fact that there is no atmosphere, thou they could do more with the tractor beam creating some form of color casting and maybe use the atmospheric engine to make some sort of dust cloud round the massive asteriod chunk, seems pretty plain to me... Love the detonation animation thou... Ccplease give us more animations. Like the claws wings moving in warp also can we have high texture density things like the minokawa look great once they zoomed out but the in station view is pretty shit... And shows the lack of pixel density, dont worry we already potatoe mode for large fleets but the other 90% would be nice to have sharper textures
---
Never happened.
---
Nah, they just banned you for lulz
---
You talking crap bro - out of the four major rental alliances in Dronelands Unspoken are only blue to skillurself renters Pan-Intergalactic.
---
I also like to live dangerously
---
I agree, its difficult to find all bots. But those guys are the most blatant type of bots.
---
One easy way to spot them is to have one guy in your renter alliance check dotlan ratting statistic. Maybe do this twice per month and look at the past 14 days of ratting in your renting region.
---
For example here are two systems:
---
 [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/HPBE-D/stats/2019-04-16:2019-04-25](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/HPBE-D/stats/2019-04-16:2019-04-25) 
---
 [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/YI-GV6/stats/2019-04-16:2019-04-25](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/YI-GV6/stats/2019-04-16:2019-04-25) 
---
Looking at the NPC kills the 1st one shows a clear pattern, while the 2nd one seems more random.
---
Of course this doesn't mean they are botting 100%, but you can double check those systems maybe with a neutral alt to check their reaction time or talk to them.
---
Also you can't find all bots using this method (mining bots or player that only bot during a movie) but its a start and better than nothing.
---
nothing, cuz the server shuts down and doesnt do any calculations whatsoever
---
Nice Loki
---
How big was that gate the caldari made in that trailer ages ago?
---
OK, so when I log back in it would be like nothing happened?
---
i was only getting maybe 30 or 40 seconds less using faction ammo and faction drones and the costs per site for just ammo and dead drones were like 10 mil which is nearly a quarter of the earnings
---
You'll warp back to where you got disconnected.
---
Airlock fetish?
---
cause that's totally not happening under capitalism!
---
OK, thanks.
---
As far as i know they only use VNIs and salvagers. There are some bigger targets in dead end system though.  [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/J7-BDX](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/J7-BDX)  [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/5Q65-4](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/5Q65-4)
---
They got really cautious after losing a bunch of supers though.
---
if they have the ability to flag botters for bounty, why not just ban them?
---
the issue lies in actually finding the bots, you know
---
we dont really routinely do data/relics, we have attempted some earlier though and we pretty much hope they switch aggro a lot or that we can burn through a lot of the dps before we die. it mostly worked out pretty well but i wouldnt want to have to do that every site. Btw what kind of clear times did you get with the t3c's?
---
Opposing faction deploys interference matrix to disrupt the citadel. Fuel cost increases by 25% per day, cumulative, which can be entirely reset by reclaiming the system. While in hostile owned space, your faction cannot dock, only your corp, and opposing faction can dock regardless of access list.
---
Can't CCP reverse engineer the not, look for characteristic behaviour, then just mass ban all of them?
---
you die
---
If you were in a combat site everything will have respawned too btw.
---
"Space"
---
- Patrick Stewart
---
now i want the wipe even more, if we can also get rid of destructive players like you
---
Ah i didn't think of suspect timer via repping for example.
---
Ignore all the boogieman stories about how you must be docked and whatnot. It's mostly silliness.
---
Ohhh my bad
---
__Patrick Stewart is a national treasure.__

 [https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98577267/](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98577267/) 
---
Yes, this extremly active PvP Alliance only has taxrate so the members can pvp without the endangerment of spodbrain
---
What if Concord is supposed to come after you in a few seconds after server closes, will they remember when server comes back up?
---
when you report 500 of them in a month and yet the corp that gets all the Money is still there.
---
Treated like shit? I love being the meatshield. Headfirst into battle with a taste for blood, fantasies of a battlefield littered with dead bees and the salty tears of my enemies. To die is an awefully big adventure and today is a good day to die!
---
So i started yesterday. Whats the best setup for an Amarr corvette? absolutely love the ship design and i dont want any other. Been doing some pirate npc hunting missions so far.
---
Well i think u guys were either saying some really racist sht or really badly translated chinese sentences.
---
I think it's more the pricing people sometimes find excessive rather than the fact skins exist.
---
At least the newer skins actually look different and aren't just a slightly darker/brighter shade of their original color.
---
Thanks for taking the time to anser. :D 
---
Need to find a news channel or something in YouTube or whatever. I love that kind of stuff.
---
Wait...only an entire planet? LET'S GO BOIS
---
¿Porque no los dos?
---
If you stay undocked during dt, just do not leave the ship. :D
---
You know the third party wiki is good when it kills the first party wiki.
---
its really not though
---
I once lost a ferox forgetting my safety was red. Clicked on a war target in space with hot guns just as a neut landed under my mouse cursor. 
---
Mostly embarrassing because I was in the middle of a fleet fight and was immediately hazed for it.
---
Whoops.
---
There are a few Angel models which are completely unique and not used for player ships too.
---
Why would the loser be the one to get the LP?  That makes no sense.
---
Also...so you are also saying if someone wastes 10 minutes in this site and no one comes to fight them...they get no LP either?
---
They've been saying that since 2013, i wouldnt hold my breath.
---
Pretty much the same thing that happen when you disconnect in space, you log back in, emergency warp back to where you were, forget to turn your tank back on and die horribly.
---
^^That ^^ last ^^bit ^^might ^^just ^^be ^^me
---
Throw in Muninns and he's sorted
---
Concord response is unavoidable, you can't fight back or escape them. If in some way you do escape them (a bug, or maybe right at the downtime) - its a bannable offence.
---
&gt; Origin requires you to be dead and in AUTZ
---
You're right it's so much better
---
and lose all the money from the bot accounts?
---
that would be querious
---
I did once avoid them by accident, I made a Reddit post at the time. Seemed like a random bug and nobody at CCP seemed to care.
---
Deliberately avoiding them is a punishable exploit.
---
https://youtu.be/WQdVw0Ltqdg
---
I was thinking, could it be possible that he was in highsec and not realized it
---
Get a zarmazd- it's the best subcap healing ship in the game- it also looks so fucking sexy :)
---
I'm pretty sure it was regular TEST spam. I'm not sure. You can get chat banned for spamming chat. Just nobody reports us because it's TEST culture.
---
1 on 1 the WH40k can match many of their equals and could probably punch up a good amount. But there are only a few of them and nobody has any idea how to repair them, so it might take out a couple dozen titans but the ability for us to build more and repair the damaged ones puts Eve on a massive advantage.
---
Can the sun set in space? 🤔
---
It does happen, true.  But the players in most of the large, well-established alliances understand that new players are the lifeblood of the game, and see it as being in the best interests of all to help get them started and loving the game.
---
I'm a (relative) noob, but that was my experience in goons - say what you will, goons step up in a big way to help new players get started:  free ship programs, free skillbook programs, lots of people who will mentor and help you figure out how to get to where you want to go.  I've heard the same about other numerous other alliances as well - both friendly and hostile.
---
To be fair WH40K ships are ungodly OP to my knowledge
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
&gt;what mechanics
---
Highsec pvp mechanics: Concord, docking aggro stuff, neutral bumping, neutral scouting, gank alts etc. And if I remember right they couldn't ban neutral fleet bonuses from working.
---
&gt;If you want 100% safety from wardecs- don't own a structure!
---
If you want to wardec someone- own a structure!
---
If you want to fly nothing but Logi you will be the most popular guy. As others have explained logi=healer.
---
Theres two types of Logi ships you can get into at first. 
---
The frigate logi ships and cruiser logi. 
---
As a bonus if you fly healer/Logi ships your ships will often be paid for by others as not many people want to fly them.
---
Send me a mail with your in game name if you want some more help on what to train. 
---
I'd also reccomend joining SF Spectre fleet chat channel in game they are a public PvP roam that will reimburse your logi ships when you roam with them most of the time.
---
Naw. The spaceship Yamato is under 300m and can destroy a planet.
---
What we need is a wave motion gun.
---
No it's not
---
Yeah it seems that every large alliance has a newbro Corp strictly focused on nurturing and helping new players, which I love honestly as such things don’t really exist in other games as complex or old as Eve.
---
Good point. 
---
A couple of EvE titans would definitely have advantage and their arnament is not too shabby either. :) 
---
And taking into consideration EvE production capacity and some already existing supercap umbrellas, Eve would probably win a clash with any of those universes in the end. 
---
I was thinking more about the 1v1 scenario.
---
I just didn’t word it correctly, but regardless as I mentioned before, that was my personal experience and impressions, I’m not here to bash anyone or argue with anyone.
---
Hahaha such a great thread. Destiny was also absolutely wrong here wtf you talking about
---
I didnt know planets had rings
---
Everything in 40K is ungodly OP, that is the whole point of it existing. :DDD 
---
But one has to take all such arguments with at least a grain of salt, everyone has its favourite setting and understandably roots for his team. :)
---
Wait... did the Russians use to be runny Deripaska??!
---
In Goons AMOK would recruit that dude.
---
on a side note: ccp closed 5 of my bug reports on the same day whitout fixing any of them (real game bugs not just "gameplay" stuff like this)
---
so i might have gone on the "black list" so atlest i dont have to take the time to report real games bugs anymore
---
10 bubble sabre in a ships SMA is the only thing worth
---
Your mistake was filing a bug report instead of posting to Reddit
---
Yes?
---
Oh stop being fucking retarded
---
Yeah, it was TiDi, but everything still worked properly on my ship, at least. No real problems with modules not activating or anything like that
---
Beautiful
---
true :-)
---
Pretty much the one everyone Ive seen use, such as:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76383197/ 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75811152/
---
Im on my phone so I dont have exact numbers, but my enyo is ~350dps unheated, and my hecate is ~360ish? unheated. The hecate overheats damage better, but applies worse. It can dual web to help track, but in my enyo, that means he's in my face where I want him to be. As soon as I hit 5% armor Im hitting adc and overheating the saar.
---
Alright thanks I'll check it out
---
Snuff killing lowsec one aar at a time.
---
A couple of points: 
---
* Even more so than in WoW, a "healer" ("logistics" in EVE) needs to understand the fight just like any shooter to anticipate who and when he need to pay attention to.  
---
* Unlike WoW, the "Character" is not specialized, your "ship" is.  As a character you could jumps from a DPS ship directly into a Logistics ship and be effective.  
---
* The analogy to WoW would be gear.  Imagine WoW without races or classes or skill tree.  Just straight up gear.  Jump into healing gear - be the healer.  Jump into Plate, be the tank etc.  In this respect Eve is far more complicated than WoW since the role you play is never confined by an outside force.  
---
* So, I recommend to give EVE a try without directly going into Logi, at least the basics.  Run some missions etc (there is no leveling, skills are accumulated over time, not action).  After a couple of weeks look at Logi, find a good corp, find the "Logi Anchor" (names vary, but inevitably there is a dude who knows his Logi stuff) and have him teach you.
---
Sure it is. Since I lobby on behalf of merchant mariners, and we've supported things like MARPOL VI and the like, I've never been accused of lobbying "for ocean pollution." It's the opposite, actually.
---
It was a ccp event.
---
Like I said before and have been saying since this happened, I did nothing wrong.
---
Just do it on SiSi
---
They are also hand painted in china, and probably have a lot of issues with export and IP due to that.
---
I, for one, welcome our new future Chinese overlords.
---
Multiple times a day
---
you die and the server  pods you.
---
Or logi'ing pirates on gate in lowsec...
---
Ye it’s a thing with all faction forts Afaik.
---
It's kinda like having a flag pole in your base, which I guess is 'fine'?
---
Corvets are not by any mean suppose to be used for anything past the first starter missions. Eve is a game about specialization about really about cool looking ships. You're *really* going to struggle doing anything else with it.
---
hahahaha holy fuck
---
Hey, at least you can't see the Helios most of the time
---
Sauce?
---
I have no experience with the Kronos but the Dominix makes a great L4 ship, very versatile and forgiving.  It may not be fast or sexy or exciting but it gets the job done.  Never run out of ammunition helps as well.  
---
And they are comparably cheap, no reason to bling them, T2 gear works perfectly fine.
---
Flying logi is definitely the most fun playing incursions, you really feel like you're having an impact when saving a guy who broadcasted a bit too late.
---
yeah i found one more 7 jumps away and it was also on a faction fort https://i.imgur.com/7EFOVVV.png
---
Alright we start another day with you not keeping focus on the work. Elder you need to focus.
---
They joys of having turned your safety off then accidentally venturing into HS.
---
Flying near the enemy fleet as a ceptor will lead you pretty fast into your death. You're going to be useless for most of the fight, but if there is a lot of warp in and out, you can be fast and tackle each time an enemy ship and hold well. And of course, chasing after the enemy and providing good warps or chasing the enemy interdictors.
---
Bot was not a newly created rental alliance, the new ones were pibc cohell and hk associates, of those, unspoken blued pibc, the only ones in range for dozens of jumps, lazerhakws blued pibc and hk associates, and both of you probably haven't touched hk and cohell besides killing a hauler passing by lxq, so hardly any content.
---
So yeah, you didn't refuse to shit, you blued what you had to in order to keep your forever war with prothean, and nc. Was probably too inept to start caring about bot like skillu did with their renters since the start.
---
"Lets intensively study them first.  Very intensively ove the next 27 months.  Wounldt want to be hasty."
---
A Tornado will literally alpha many cruisers from full health, let alone frigates and shuttles.
---
My experience as a subcap pilot is NC is more active then pl, they also have more sov and more pilots. In these stats PL is firmly last, i don't know about there isk income. So PL may be more powerful in terms of wealth.
---
The audacity to name the alliance this and stick bots into it with nothing done about it is pretty sickening.
---
Legends say that the counter turns red at 100k.
---
Many have died trying to find out.
---
At least you got the kill unlike todays proteus.
---
Serious tip, if you want something fixed on long term bugreport.
---
If you want a answer and relatively quick solution open a support ticket.
---
YES.
---
Hope that was a trolling comment
---
Anyone else just randomly lose 45 mins of their life?
---
Would mine. Ring rocks are more interesting than random rocks in space. Then give us random space whales which rise up to attack us for stealing their rocks.
---
No "just" about that screenshot. Great shot.
---
Skill has helped us in the past, we were not originally blue to pibc until we blew up a ratting super alt of someone in skill.  
---
We mostly fight groups who move in close to etherium reach, for the longest time it was mostly the remnants of the leftover russians. Prothean, and eventually, No Value and the remnants of solar fleet. After they left just moved on to the next target on our list basically. It's not just us specifically targeting bot so to say, it's just that they're the nearest thing to kill. It's not like we didn't expect NC. to come kill us when they were fed up with us bullying their renters. Which is why we only have a couple of forts, 1 azbel and tatara really in terms of infrastructure. If anything, ER wasn't supposed to be a permanent thing anyway, just worked out that there was always someone to shoot/harass. Losing the space now opens up a lot of options for us, and is still providing content for a lot more people now.  
---
It will be interesting to see where it all goes in the aftermath but for now we wait and see.
---
Yeah, that's where ship fights can get a bit tilted. Sometimes they're designed around being the heart of a smaller fleet and are absurdly powerful, other ships are designed around flying as a fleet of them.
---
Yeah, i havent seen a barghest in so long i thought it was a citadel design id never seen before.
---
It seems to be a legacy tcu that was close to the station and the station got converted and swallowed the tcu in the process. 
---
Filing a bug report is a childish approach to having this stuff fixed. Should have started stirring shit on Reddit straight away.
---
Pretty much just forgot the sec status of the system. Lost a brutix to that about ten years ago because I got super excited that I landed on two hulks.
---
Clearly the solution is to ping Dran until he reacts
---
A good logi is probably the most desired and valuable player in pve in and pvp fleets. One logi is worth 10 dps ships.
---
can't say, I don't remember :C   
---
I play eve only few weeks
---
Doesn't really sound like there was lot of fighting among dreads with that numbers disparity.
---
ahaha, thanks)
---
well, I found 2-3 planets with rings
---
well, I just started to play :D
---
thank you
---
agree. and thanks
---
You are not supposed to be able to do that mechanically anymore.      
---
However old TCUs that were next to a outpost or station before the conversion to faction forts they remain there until killed.
---
Legacy placements are known for ages. The exploits for placing structures in such unintended places have been mostly patched with new restrictions. This needs the manual moving of the structures in space. Ha ha good luck having someone in ccp doing it when it can’t be directly done by a gm. If you make enough fuss on Reddit about Kid with guns not only boting and rmting but also cheating sov you might have a chance.
---
The instant permajamming was CCPs response to people spider tanking Concord.
---
What, the rings move? I've never noticed
---
Did this in an Ishtar a couple of years ago. Was roaming through lowsec for hours looking for fights, found nothing, jumped into a 0.5 system without realizing it and found a Myrmidon in a belt. Lock up, engage, Concorded. Oops.
---
In general though a lot of the complaints of hurr toke weeks to get my ship back is because people use the wrong function.
---
Use both and refer to the bug report in your support ticket
---
Try zooming in.
---
I love that moncal viscount class dreadnaught
---
It's like that but things are plex.
---
I still can't make a trip to Jita without shitting myself in hisec
---
I don't know about the other reports but as others mentioned the TCU thing next to faction forts is not a bug.
---
They remain there since before the faction fort conversion but you can't put them so close together once either of them died.
---
Bug reports in general  are not support tickets. It's a systen for them to identify and eventually iron out bugs.     
---
That they were closed probably just means they have been read and filed, not necessarily been fixed.      
---
That or it weren't really bugs, like your TCU.
---
lol. thanks
---
I have~~nt played~~ been winning for like 2 years so maybe that's it :P
---
There is a second amarr one too looks similar to a Promethean avatar just much much bigger, 
---
https://images.app.goo.gl/9KzKL8eJ6WcvVYrE7
---
See, I thought this game was supposed to be about war an conflict.
---
My main issue is with the fact you can place citadels in range of ANYTHING, the worst one being jump gates, I mean wtf is that about, they're FAR better than jump bridges used to be and yet can be on grid with a keepstar that can DD you in under 10 seconds -\_-
---
I play only... a week, or something. Big thanks to you
---
Are there any incursions still running? I used to fly with TVP but they seem dead now.
---
What in the unholy name of snorg is this and who the fuck are you guys
---
loool. 
---
Do you actually think this?
---
Something something something minmatar
---
Because nobody would roll an alt to collect their own bounties, right?
---
What CCP can do is fucking ban the obvious bots. If players can detect them enough to have reliable strats to hunt them, CCP can fucking do what our subs pay them to and maintain the damn game.
---
Sarcasm is hard.
---
He's saying the winner gets LP from the loser, I think.      
---
What happens if the loser doesn't have any LP, i don't know.
---
&gt; See, I thought this game was supposed to be about war an conflict.
---
oh my sweet summer child...
---
no. you can say smartbomb a full health shuttle very easily. you can even smartbomb frigates, but then it depends on fit.
---
Thats one way to suck something...
---
Tbh a fleet n EVE is even more powerful due to FAXes. No other universe really has a logistics ship of the same scale.
---
&gt; Are you saying CCP is not doing their jobs.
---
HAHA. You're either trolling or haven't been playing very long.
---
As in you've only been playing for one week?
---
I've been doing a lot of exploration lately, but I seem to find myself dead quite a bit. I know the best way into those sweet nullsec exploration sites is through wormholes, but how can I move around Nullsec without getting ganked? What's the best way to move from one null system to another without hitting some sort of warp disruption bubble? Once I enter a system, do I just need to warp to a planet that is not in the path of the stargate I intend to exit from, before warping to the gate at 100km?
---
Wouldn't bot users just plant alpha scouts in strategic positions like gates or something?
---
Right, another very good point. FAXes would be totally broken in any other universe. :D
---
&gt;That's short for Logistics, because for some reason CCP named the Tech 2 versions of these ships Logistic vessels, even though they don't do any actual logistics in the real sense. They are repair auxiliaries.
---
"In military science, logistics is concerned with maintaining army supply  lines while disrupting those of the enemy, since an armed force without  resources and transportation is defenseless. ... In military logistics,  logistics officers manage how and when to move resources to the places  they are needed. " - from wiki.
---
Logistic ships in Eve move fleet's repair resourses (shields or armor or capacitor) where they are most needed. After all, they are not healers - they don't heal. They either transfer or repair... and even that is done by transfering nano-bots, which in turn repair damage.
---
I know right? I've played the game on and off since launch and I've always adapted with the playstyle and game changes. But citadels and jump gates and their implementation has made the game easier but at the same time too safe. Couple that with rampant botting and who really plays the game anymore?
---
I remember from an Alliance Panel at Fanfest about 5 years ago the guy from EVE uni said the group with the largest number of individual clicks onto the EVE Uni wiki were CCP and that CCP syndicated some of their content for the official wiki.
---
Make spaceships explode again!
---
Beanstalk Inc were also a new renter alliance formed by PH who now reside in former XIX space in Kalevala Expanse. I can’t speak for Lazerhawk’s but Unspoken has very few blues and Pan-Intergalactic are the only renter alliance we have set blue. Also you falsely claim Pan-Inter are the only renters nearby - do you even look at Dotlan? Droneland regions bordering our home in E.R are Malpais (BOT), The Spire (BOT and other NC pets) and Kalevala Expanse (Beanstalk Inc) so why are you claiming we have to go dozens of jumps to shoot non blues??
---
Oh... well clearly i need more info about the game. Gotta check which ships are standart, and what path to follow.
---
There's also tackle, recon, and logistics as well as EWAR and logi. Basically, pressing F1 and fighting someone is actually one of the smaller parts of the game and most people will take on a support role at some point in the game but the true stars are the specialists.
---
Pre changes - earlier positioning of some TCU was defined so strictly.
---
wow talk about a conservative t3c fit
---
That Vindi fit though XD
---
I presume this is more a meme now-a-days than actual point.  
---
Bot accounts consume PLEX (raising it's price) and that PLEX is paid by someone who needs ISK. Presuming these bots would exists, then there would be less demand for PLEX, thus maybe lowering it's price. Question becomes, would that require more real money investment to get same amount of ISK or would it lower it as it's not so worthwhile to get ISK using real money.

Perhaps the meme has ascended beyond your petty archive?  It will not be contained or categorized.

this is a terrible post just fyi

Oh, skillu alt, is that why now he's in test without a character baazar post ?

The reality is that you killed one of our renters, you had to pay for it, then blued pibc.

&gt;docking aggro stuff
---
??????????
---
docking is a highsec mechanic?
---
&gt;neutral scouting
---
this is viable in nullsec as well
---
&gt;gank alts etc
---
this is rarely, if ever, utilized
---
&gt;And if I remember right they couldn't ban neutral fleet bonuses from working.
---
you remember incorrectly.
---
So far all you have is
---
1. You can gank (which no one utilizes)
---
and
---
2. Neutral bumping
---
if this is what you think causes the 20 to 1 odds, you're delusional
---
&gt;If you want to wardec someone- own a structure!
---
okay, and once they anchor the 600m structure and cycle one every 1.5 weeks it's balanced?
---
your change is irrelevant, and misguided

What do you do for a living?

---
Nah daddy, the idea would be that once you move into the new space the gate blows just like the eve gate.
---
&gt;Once I enter a system, do I just need to warp to a planet that is not in the path of the stargate I intend to exit from, before warping to the gate at 100km?
---
on this note, when are we getting rid of ESS in fully-spawned anomalies? or on grid with POS'es that can hit out to it? or maybe make them mandatory so they can be fight-starters? 
---
or **anything**?
---
Never warp directly gate to gate in null. Always warp to a planet and then warp to your next gate. This will help a lot with not getting caught in bubbles.
---
You should start looking at frigates and run some level 1 missions, and then figure out what you want to do in the game because Eve is a sandbox, not a classic MMO. Running missions in high security space is a pretty big waste for what the game can offer.
---
What the fuck is the point of that?
---
Guys, gotta move all your shit from delve to new delve. Then we can carry on as we were.
---
&gt;you can warp cloaked with any cloaking device if you do it right
---
How do you do this? Because that would be very useful, except from a bit of testing its impossible, activating cloak stops warp, and activating warp makes cloaking impossible, even if you hit cloak while aligning
---
Can they balance the first round of them first? We have a couple extremely dominant solo/smallgang ships and the rest are junk.
---
Log in, sell supers, extract super alts.  Live like a king in system of your choice flying/losing subcaps from now until the stars burn out.  Or EVE closes down.  Whichever happens first.
---
The drone took a beautiful picture
---
Ive been finding ESS in nullsec that are in burner missions now. Somestimes 3000km from accel gate, so you cant warp there.
---
Guess CCP only nerfs ESS when people try to get fights out of it, but its ok when nullbears can put them in full spawned anoms, burner mission 3000km away so only their pod/cloaked ship can secure it.
---
All hypothetical off, but the idea would be all new space, all new ore, minerals, potentially all new ships and aliens, new types of space, it would be a fresh new thing but that allowed you to get some of your pre existing shit in before the door closes.
---
Imagine there not being gates just wormholes,  then having soe and concord build gate networks over time and players doing the same the universe would grow organically.
---
Hypothetically ofc
---

So far I've been killing them in lowsec.
---
At first I was going to up-vote a Dino post.
---
But then I realized I was about to up-vote a Dino post.
---
Then I realized that this actually is a bug.
---
Then it sank in that CCP is bad.
---
And that this is bad.
---
and your bad.
---
Downvoted.
---
Sergaljerk imploded due to drama, and I don't think anyone wants to start a "furry corp" anymore to take in their dregs, because they're, well, dregs. I bounced around all over eve for a while after that but it seems like the few worthwhile furries ended up in Dreddit. So come join Brand Newbros in Test Alliance Please Ignore. We'll show you the ropes.
---
I hate to break it to you, but the Avatar wouldn't feel a thing
---
Small addition, a horde SIG, BFL, was with NC in the initial reffing, eagle v eagle, etc.
---
CCP, I don't feel so well
---
So if everything is new... just do an asset wipe and save the hassle of trying to create a mirror map with everything for people to migrate to.
---
Reminds me that sometimes we go roaming in null from a hisec staging, and don't mind fighting in lowsec on the way there. But the route goes hisec &gt; one lowsec system &gt; one hisec system &gt; lowsec &gt; nullsec.
---
We've had that sort of issues in the hisec system sandwiched between the lowsecs. :')
---
I've been told that it quietly got patched out a while ago. It was a trick you could pull a couple years ago, and I didn't think to test in modern EvE before making myself look like an idiot.
---
At Least you're encouraging reporting, that's one notch above Imperium and two above Legacy (who've kicked people for creating noise).
---
How so? Do you even understand how dreadbombs work? Big stuff dies regularly to dreadbombs because of cynos. That's why hunters often make new, out of alliance characters so the locals don't recognise known hunters. If a known hunter starts poking around you will usually see a ping go out about it. You don't need a 100 titans, you don't even need a 100 dreads (you could use them, if you are baiting a rag tag super response).
---
In wormholes you are still limited in fleet size and dps (it got a bit better with trig ship line because of their mass), but not in null...
---
+1 for using Rubal Report. Glad to see thats sticking.
---
By 2006 (when I started) there were coalitions. I was part of the northern coalition in 2007 with MM, Razor, Pure, MH, Tau Ceti, etc. To the east was the drone coalition of xxDeath, Solar, IRC, etc. BOB was down in Delve with MC buffering to the north. Goons and RA were blued up to the south east (iirc). Tri was nanoing around everywhere.
---
I think your being a little too nostalgic. 
---
When I started playing in highsec in 2006, the old bitter vet in my corp was always talking about the good old days of nullsec.
---
It is a Brisc wind that blows CCP no good.
---
&gt;I should be clear, I'm not advocating for this specific change. I just want something to change and this seems like a somewhat decent place to start.
---
Well, that at least is good, because it would be terrible. Do you have any actual ideas for how to change things without just making ratting impossible, because that really seems to be the goal of the people who make these posts.
---
&gt;if you're worried about a fleet of cloakys roaming your space, A dirty gate with a couple of ceptors for fast tackle is terrifying to jump through to.
---
Its really not, you won't catch a t3c on a gatecamp unless you're either very lucky or he doesn't hit cloak. I've seen plenty of them make it past an oijanen camp with 30+ people on gate. Also, nobody smart takes gates blind, they have scouts, so even if you do manage to trap them in a pipe, get people organized and waiting, ignoring everything else in your space, the gang can agree to afk for 5 min and come back.
---
&gt;A 100mn cruiser can be difficult to hold down without at least webs on it
---
Well, its a good thing the loki doesn't have any bonuses to webbing, right? Its not like that would allow them to web you from 20km out. 
---
So even if you don't have a tengu to ecm tackle off, that's not really a huge problem because a smart loki never gets in scram range in the first place.
---
&gt;If you fit say some cruise missile BS then you can not only run a site from significantly further away, making it much harder for something to slowboat cloaked to you, but it also give you the option to MJD away if the hunter is relying on a point to hold you down.
---
That's not going to happen, though. Rattlesnakes are already uncommon enough for ratting, because of how expensive they are to replace. They're going to only get less common after something like this, not more common. The other ships have a pretty bad isk/hr/effort compared to other stuff like mining, exploring, or abyssals.
---
Yet everybody tethered

Don’t know about you but I would be proud of this title 😃

You fucking degenerates.
---
is that actually right that its the first in two years?  i thought we lost the occasional idiot every few months.
---
Id be careful with your fake news. Reality is we killed a neut, then blued pibc so it wouldnt happen again. Poor Wyvern guy got nothing from eating shit
---
ROFL
---
True,  although one thing is  always certian is that ....................................urgaypwnd.
---
Cannot stress this enough.
---
I've been exploring for years and I bet 80% of my deaths have been due to me being complacent and warping gate to gate when there were 1 or 2 neutrals in local.
---
When I'm on the ball I like warping to something about mid distance from the next gate, ideally at least 45* off the direct line between gates.
---
Awesome thank you
---
When are we getting the Rubal report
---
*"Oh Shit.. Guys.. red alert.  there are 50 neuts in system with us,  engage the cloaks and meet at Rendezvous point Charlie"*    a panicked voice said over comms as we transited into the next system. 
---
*"Shut the fuck up Carol"*   another voice chimed in with clear irritation in his voice.    *"For the eighth bloody time, We are in high sec... there are supposed to be neuts here  There are neuts all over the region happily not shooting at each other..."*
---
a moment of awkward silence passed before Carol chimed back hesitantly.   *"But..."*  when he was cut off.  
---
*"No buts Carol, you call an alert one more time and if your armor is not already half gone I am going to finish you myself just to reduce the pounding headache in my head, and then I am going to call back to HQ and pull a dozen favors owed to me from the Titan core to have your medical station blockaded and turned into ash for...Security Reasons, I am sure after careful review the higher ups will thank me for it.. now shut up, fly in formation and lets complete our objective and go back home"*  the commander said 
---
The comms clicked on momentarily as if someone was going to say something but then after another moment of awkward silence clicked back off again. 
---
The fleet aligned to its next destination and began its organized warp jump to a stargate approximately 70 AU away.       After the fleet transited from normal space into warp and all ships were accounted for,  I mentally sighed and turned the music back up, it was some new underground band from Rens that sounded like every other coming out of the Republic these days but it was decent enough to keep going during ops.       We quickly made our way through the system and transited into the next.   Only 17 more to go.   I sighed again. 
---
*"Oh shit... 80 neuts, "*  an all too familiar voice said with panic in his voice 
---
*"Okay thats it..."* the commander said with exasperation in his voice. 
---
  
---
The entire squadron, save for one,  received a new priority target and shoot command.. 
---
I grinned and began targeting the once friendly ship and knew the Commander would probably stay true to his word.  What I wouldn't do to be in the Titan core when those orders came in.. This would be one they would be talking about for awhile.
---
Next time you have a bright idea like this. Just keep it to yourself.
---
Is he wrong?
---
I think he's russian tho
---
probably, yes, but also entirely irrelevant. Consider the following scenario:
---
1. I jump a character into system then warp off to parts unknown (safe, bouncing between celestials, whatever).
---
2. Gate-bot registers me entering system.
---
3. Everything in anoms warps off because the system is now not secure.
---
This may sound like exactly what we have now, but it very much isn't. With no local, bots have absolutely no idea if I am still logged in and hunting or if i have logged off and they can return to your regularly scheduled krabbing, *until another gatebot sees me leaving the system*. But even that isn't foolproof, because I could have a covert cyno equipped and brought in another half-dozen hunters before leaving the system so the bots think it's safe. 
---
Even leaving the cynos completely aside, you can (solo) log off alpha alts all over nullsec, which would force the bots to either stop krabbing forever (mission accomplished) or to use some sort of heuristic (a.k.a. wild-ass guessing) which would make them inherently huntable.
---
When you stop posting for a full week.
---
Machine learning would crush this problem in a heartbeat.  True fact.
---
As far as i remember there was some devpost? or reddit or whatever post from some of the ccp devs who said they basically investigate manually with a pair of dudes right now. But he also said they are working on some automated solutions. So right now its kinda screwed, but there is hope that ccp has something to find these bots short before star citizen will be released.
---
I really think eagles suck compared to muninms. That alpha is just too good and the ability to engage and slip away is really beneficial.
---
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/belblr/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_april_18/) is last week’s thread, so people can search through all the old advice/answers.
---
Pretty sure the constant whelps and half arsed "invasion" with feeds being blamed online members is the reason for fleet numbers but at this point the amount of ridiculous shenanigans going on in test I wouldn't be surprised if our FCs got demoralized by something so stupid.
---
Instanced game play is boring as hell. Just look at abyssal pvp.
---
Ok chevis copy cat
---
Yeah, I've made a fool of myself loads of times in this game. As long as the mocking is good natured I welcome it.
---
&gt; How so?
---
how so to what?
---
&gt;Do you even understand how dreadbombs work? Big stuff dies regularly to dreadbombs because of cynos. That's why hunters often make new, out of alliance characters so the locals don't recognise known hunters. If a known hunter starts poking around you will usually see a ping go out about it.

&gt;In wormholes you are still limited in fleet size and dps (it got a bit better with trig ship line because of their mass), but not in null...

what's your point
---
Cant believe the essays here were written by real persons.
---
They’re tethered, only scared ppl tether.
---
whoosh
---
look at the area under the screen after you spin a bit
---
It's against the rules, cause they made it impossible to do it in legal way.
---
In other words it is cloaky camping paradise.
---
If that was what destroys botting period i would even be okay with it.
---
But i don't like afk mechanics in all it's varietys including but not limited to ratting, mining and camping. 
---
And i fear botters would cope with it just fine by volume and leave actual players, even if afk farming, even more in the dust.
---
Imo it's hard to tell which way it will go in the end. But once done a removal of local might never be reversed.
---
PvE player ultimately not only enavle content by producing goods, but also *are* the content PvP focused players crave.

Step on them too many times and it might hurt content more than it helps.

That being said, it was dire time the pendulum swung back towards pvp and risk after years of PvE buffs. Let's just not overshoot it in the other direction.

Define newbie, are we talking like installed the game yesterday alphas or &lt;6 month guys who're just starting to get t2 guns.

Also age is far from a guarantee of skill.

Whoever thought that'd mean start of the week needs to pay better attention to CCPs schedules.

Here’s one I’ve been meaning to ask: how the hell do you get to Thera?
---
Seriuos question though, CCP works on weekends?
---
I’m talking: never been to EVE, has no idea what all the knoepfkens are for, found 100 people who convinced themselves this shit is not as hard as they make it out to be. Never had any guidance about what ship to fly, how to fit it, they just know they want to fuck shit up.
---
Looking at his history on zkill.... yeah I gotta go with this and think some alcohol was involved.... frequently.

yea i slept on this idea and thought about how messed up it would be having to keep any sort of semblence of intel working

&gt; Its really not, you won't catch a t3c on a gatecamp unless you're either very lucky or he doesn't hit cloak. I've seen plenty of them make it past an oijanen camp with 30+ people on gate. Also, nobody smart takes gates blind, they have scouts, so even if you do manage to trap them in a pipe, get people organized and waiting, ignoring everything else in your space, the gang can agree to afk for 5 min and come back.
---
&gt; 
---
If you can't catch a post-nerf t3c in a pre-prepared camp on a gate, you're inexperienced and/or incompetent. I have taken the Oijanen-BWF gate many many many times and it's very rarely properly 'dirty'. Hell, even blockade runners get through (which really should not be a thing). The idea of a 'dirty' gate is to basically spam the surrounding space with cans, drones, wrecks and ships, so that wherever the t3c may spawn after jumping, it'll always be within the magic 2500m and lose its cloak. This may sound spectacularly difficult but really isn't, especially when done on a non-regional gate.
---
&gt; That's not going to happen, though. Rattlesnakes are already uncommon enough for ratting, because of how expensive they are to replace. They're going to only get less common after something like this, not more common. The other ships have a pretty bad isk/hr/effort compared to other stuff like mining, exploring, or abyssals.
---
And this is a bad thing why? Mining brings with it much the same dangers as ratting does, just ask all the hulk pilots in Delve that die to random Hecates. Exploring leaves you inherently vulnerable as even an instawarp interceptor can and will eventually be caught, just ask all Horde pilots that died to the camp in Korsiki. Abyss is very much not safe in itself and also very much not bot-friendly (not even in a Gila as rats will murderfuck your drones). Oh, and you can also be ganked on exit/warpoff to citadel.
---
Eve Scout publically posts current wormhole locations to Therapy.

Replace the sun with a planet and that's a pretty close replica of this part of the Star Trek: Voyager intro [https://youtu.be/gX9FU8bmxQs?t=64](https://youtu.be/gX9FU8bmxQs?t=64)
---
 Well in that case sure, but it's never that binary really. The devil is in the details. I'd take 150 6 month old players who know how to anchor over 50 average ~3-4 year vets any day of the week.
---
That looks pretty cool even though it doesn't really fit the EVE design language, then again many skins have that issue. Looks kinda organic in some way, I'd buy that if I'd fly Trig ships.
---
Hi! 
---
Unfortunately I had to close a rather large amount of bug reports, which we could not process fully for several months. It seems like your bug reports were included in this mass-close. I am very sorry for this, but unfortunately it had to be done.
---
For your specific TCU issue: If this is indeed only the case for legacy TCUs + faction Fortizars, then this might be something, which needs to be fixed by hand (not sure if Customer Support have the tools for this). Have you already tried to send a support ticket about it?
---
Regarding the failure of processing enough bug reports: We are planning to increase the size of our bug hunter team, which is helping us with processing of bug reports. We had some problems with the recruitment process in the last year, which caused a backlog of applications. We should have cleared this backlog quite soon, so that new applications can be processed much faster (no promise, it could still take several months) . If you are interested in joining the volunteer bug hunter team, then feel free to apply at  [https://volunteers.eveonline.com/](https://volunteers.eveonline.com/)  for Bug Hunters / ECAID.
---
Regards, CCP Habakuk, Senior Quality Assurance Analyst (also liaison for the Bug Hunter team)
---
how about no?
---
if you're flying a freighter you've already made your decision, there are a plethora of ships that are nigh ungankable, and a few that are really ungankable.
---
Apart from incidents of "oh fuck my marshal is eating shit" (replace marshal with appropriate too-blingy-to-live stuff like Moracha), can't think of any such cases.
---
Sounds like a great idea, and get Concordokened in the process.
---
It also has an extra light in the front of the ship and there are constantly little particles flying into it.
---
Possibly triglavian data?
---
Muninns are definitely the better to have if you are outnumbered at least. Much less critical mass needed to alpha shit. 
---
Pretty sure the Eagles have more tank though?
---
That's a banned meme
---
Wait, first they banned memes, now they banned reactions
---
Very fair point. Don't undock what you can't afford to lose.
---
Zapping the cap of a Catalyst, Talos, Tornado or Talos... the typical gank ships after a bump. They all have capless weapons. Also - drifting for XYZ time in high sec isn't a penalty if you survive the gank attempt unless you are being hit by war targets.
---
I honestly feel oppressed now without my reactions
---
You could at least try to play the other games set in the EVE universe. Oh wait...
---
Don’t you also hate that fucking autocomplete bullshit?
---
Also, I’m going to have to find where EVE scout is. Never used it.
---
There are already enough counterplay to being permanently bumped. If you can’t figure them out then you’re bad at the game and deserve to die/get scammed.
---
You have some great insight and information. I'm not sure how you know this information and I'm assuming it's accurate but in any case, it would be so nice if that same informartion/explanation was relayed back to the person who submitted the bug report by CCP, so in-turn they would know. It would also do CCP a service by ensuring the same "false flags" are not reported again, minimizing on douplicate efforts and wasted time. How is this person supposed to know it's a none issue if the bug reports simply get closed with no explanation.
---
I'm not even going to expect it to be an actual statement, it'll probably vague as hell going "eh, we couldn't prove it *really*"
---
Basically. I keep looking at it expecting the Enterprise to sweep into view.
---
thats the eve russia skin from the world tour
---
If you can't find it on the oldforums thread, I know CCP Fozzie has practically the only complete video set of the AT - might be worth giving him a poke!
---
I wish this was 3 monitors wide... &lt;3
---
So making gate tacks is a very good practice, especially if you will be exploring In the same areas. A gate tack is a bookmark between 10,000km to 150 km (so it’s on grid with the gate but you can warp from the mark to the gate). These are really useful, because you won’t have to rely on just dscan to see threats.
---
Please explain which ship is ungankable
---
150 km is 93.21 miles
---
Both bars and women keep you from doing logi work. I call bs on that one
---
Dude time to bring a yolo freighter alt to massive battles
---
Check and compare the signature radius over T1 BS.

---
&gt; The devil is in the details.
---
It’s true. I did mention 20 experienced guys who have worked together in fleets for a long time with a competent FC.
---
I just on’t see how you’d beat that as a newbie.
---
As soon as they can fly in a fleet, as a cohesive unit, with an FC who knows what end the warp drive sticks out of and who knows how to lead, to me they’re no longer newbies. If someone puts in the time to learn how it works and can find a group of guys who not only agree to work as a team but also do that, to me those are not newbies.
---
You’re only a newbie for so long, right? If they go through the trouble of learning fleet ops and they don’t make too many boners, they have a place in EVE, they’re one of us.
---
I did mean to say: a bunch of guys green as grass, decide to fleet up and kick the old farts’ asses. I just can’t be sold on the idea that years of experience with ships, fittings and fleet engagements would mean nothing. How sad would that be?
---
Russian event skin, that constellation is important for the russian community for reasons I can't recall.
---
The best thing to install is common sense.
---
Is it any surprise.. like also being able to anchor a jump gate in range of a KS doomsday.
---
I mean, that's the beauty of it. It would absolutely *not* be afk-cloaky-camping, unless you count "logged off" as "afk". You'd only need to be actually logged in if you want to interact, i.e. either actively gather intel (via probes or dscan) or hunt.
---
I'm not sure about the volume either. You cannot infinitely scale ratting within a single system - the anoms just don't respawn fast enough. This means that the only way to scale up is by increasing the number of systems and it'd be very easy to log-off-camp that. For example, Delve only has 97 systems to it. That may sound like a lot, but I'm pretty sure both Olmeca and Mar5hy have more alts than that.
---
As for the loss of content, a VNI that warps off the moment you enter local arguably isn't content but an irritation. So we'd have to wait and see if actual content goes up or down because this'd be hard to accurately predict from data available.

Dear Citizens of New Eden,
---
Following on from our statement on April 17, we have completed our review of the Brisc Rubal investigation and determined that our initial findings were incorrect. Neither Brisc Rubal nor the other players implicated in this incident breached CCP’s confidentiality, the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, or used privileged information to obtain an in-game advantage.
---
We made a mistake here and we offer our formal apologies. First, to Brisc Rubal and the two other players involved, both for making the allegations and for the disturbance and stress caused by the way in which we handled this situation. Second, for not collaborating with due care with the members of CSM 13, who have acted responsibly throughout. Lastly, we owe our sincere apology to the EVE community for this error. We take full responsibility for any confusion and mistrust caused by our initial assessment of the situation.

After reviewing our assessment of the information on which these allegations were based and having spoken repeatedly with everyone involved, it’s now clear that our initial actions were based on unsubstantiated assumptions. While we were motivated by a desire to protect the working relationship between the CSM and the EVE Development Team with all due speed, had we taken the time to review the information with greater scrutiny, this incident could have been resolved without the disruption that has since occurred.
---
We aim to make it up to all concerned. Right now, we are in the process of restoring access to the EVE Online accounts of all three affected players, returning any confiscated assets and providing rectification as appropriate. We will work to set this right and will be making changes to our procedures and policies to ensure this kind of situation does not reoccur.
---
Thank you for your understanding.

If you'd like to discuss this devblog, please feel free to do so in this forum thread.
---
Logi and links are two of the most helpful things you can do for people.
---
CCP should reduce the number of systems &gt;:) so that there's more competition for resources.
---
Wow, totally didn't see this coming! /s
---
Aaand it's out
---
It really makes you think how fast you posted this
---
What a fucking shitshow.
---
CCP lied, BRISC died
---
&gt;docking is a highsec mechanic?
---
Yes, it works there also. Combined with other HS mechanics can be annoying. Easily outplayed in lowsec by undocking couple dreads.
---
&gt;this is viable in nullsec as well
---
There aren't hundreds of random players going around in null that you don't know who they are. There are huge amount of randoms going around in highsec.
---
&gt;this is rarely, if ever, utilized
---
After neutral logi is banned I feel like it might be used more often.
---
&gt;if this is what you think causes the 20 to 1 odds, you're delusional
---
Yes, the mechanics are now a lot better than before. Good changes.
---
&gt;okay, and once they anchor the 600m structure and cycle one every 1.5 weeks it's balanced?
---
If they lose that every time it's ok. Defenders get their kill and content is generated.
---
whoa Warrior Turk this and his corp it is a very old "23/7" ratting enthusiast that i know from Esoteria.
---
I think everyone can agree that we all saw this coming
---
Yeah in that case sure. I've just found that at least in the subcap game it's mostly about FC quality and numbers (as long as those numbers can fly the right ship). Many an FC has run on a train on higher skill groups flying significantly more expensive ships with a blob of T1 cruisers/BCs. For the most part as long as people can anchor, activate their modules and use the broadcast window you can whip them into a shape in a very small window of time.

120k ehp 0.9s-align jackdaw. Assuming you cannot bubble it (and if you can, why bother bumping in the first place?) and assuming no server fuckery (dcs, desyncs and such, because they are impossible to counter/predict) it's unkillable (when venturing from instaundock to instadock on NPC stations, awox by changing ACL on a destination citadel is still possible).
---
Sell goy sell CCP stocks down 6 million

What an absolute cluster-fuck on CCP's part.  From a PR perspective, I cannot fathom how they possibly could have handled this worse.

Brisc did indeed never do anything wrong, good guys win again

HI PC GAMER

Warp to a celestial within dscan range of the gate and then dscan the gate looking for bubbles and/or interdictors.
---
If there are no celestials within dscan range of the gate, warp to the gate when local is empty, burn 200 km or more away but not in line with other gates in the system and make a bookmark. People generally call this type of bookmark a perch.
---
Glad to have you back!
---
200 km is 124.27 miles
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2g5Hz17C4is
---
What is the next hate train with no evidence?
---
So does this confirm CCPs bias against Imperium? Is there any punishment for the CSM members who brought these fake allegations to CCP? Am I gay?
---
Tripping over their own feet, CCP’s track record of being a steaming hot mess is upheld.
---
and test.. even spicier
---
So is it CCP's turn to be the taint licker now?
---
The ones you can't lock before it cloaks or warps.
---
So CCP over-zealously removed a CSM member at a hint of a data leak and people are still going to REEEEE about the CSM just being a place for big alliance to speculate of information others don't have.
---
Let the Init Justice For Brisc Hellmarch begin!
---
First up, everyone who said "fuck brisc" in that thread
---
So what happens to the the csm's tha misled ccp? Anything at all?
---
It was where Red Alliance held back BoB and avoided their destruction, I believe.
---
Not surprised tbh. I'm no fan of Brisc but that whole thing just smelled off right from the get go.
---
No comment.

Chribba's bot OP

Why does it not surprise me. And why do i not believe a word of it.

I have yet to see any lobbyist actually pay for his crimes. In my country, one of them hit a women by a car, not by chance, he wanted to get rid of her. luckily, she survived with no major injuries. But do you think the pig went to jail? Do you think he will ever?
---
Not surprised tbh. I'm no fan of Brisc but the thing smelled off right from the get go.
---
The Initial Brisc Report, which was written by 18 Angry Hard Knocks pilots who also happen to be INIT haters (and bot Supporters), should have focused on the people who SPIED on my 2018 CSM Campaign, and others who fabricated the whole Molok Hoax. That is, never forget, the crime since there was no Collusion, why was there an Investigation in the first place! Answer - Dirty CCP, Hard Knocks and Crooked Noobman!

This thread is going to be a shitshow.

ccp are so dumb. when noobman got banned for actual csm leaks there was no big posting and crazy statements from ccp about him - most people didn't even know it had happened, yet with brisc they went out and made crazy statements and shit all over the guy.

i legit feel bad for brisc having to go through the garbage that is ccp, they are an actual embarrassment.

Yes, CCP made a mistake but they fixed their mistake at the end. They investigated it and apologized. Dont think that many game developer would have done that. So kudos to them.

BRISC RUBAL WAS AN INSIDE JOB

LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

uh there are plenty, most notably jump freighters (unless you're retarded, which many are)

Heavy laughing incoming

Wonder what will happen to the CSM snitches that tried to remove the honorable lobbyist Brisc! SAD
---
The conspiracy to protect Brisc goes deep
---
This absolutely affected in-game politics. CCP made themselves look like fools on this one, that's for sure. Should ban yourselves for affecting game-play as GM's.
---
Someone’s getting fired at CCP for this shit...What a mess.

With a bit of luck they will learn from it.

Nothing of value was lost.

And can i have your number?

I mean, they could have not apologized for it and continued down the previous path.

That is how they could have handled it worse.

CCP finally hired a decent lawyer to write that apology. Or... maybe they simply consulted the one they have on retainer.

At least it is the right result in the end. And Eve is far better off for this kind of result than the normal stonewalling...
---
So what was it they thought he did?
---
&gt; Yes, it works there also. Combined with other HS mechanics can be annoying. Easily outplayed in lowsec by undocking couple dreads.

how does this even make sense? you can just undock a couple of talos and nuke shit here too???

im still curious about what was up with this part:

"this misconduct was brought to us by the CSM themselves as an immediate threat to the integrity of the CSM as an institution"

Probably, maybe?

I am bisexual.

NO COLLUSION!
---
Ready to eat those words of yours?
---
Where are we putting bets on who tried to pull this off only to ultimately fail?
---
They could have doubled down on the mistake instead of owning it. It's all too common that corporate PR works by never admitting a mistake.
---
Apology or not, fuck CCP.
---
Just like, do a goddamn job right.  You don't even do your actual jobs.
---
I guess we will not see dev blog about it.

I believed!

Didn't noobman come out and say 'yea i did it, I was quitting anyways'

Ok
---
Props to Brisc and all the other CSM Members that have been sitting on their hands for two weeks not leaking anything they have learned from CCP about the whole incident. That radio silence was eerie but obviously necessary. Good job guys.

How many “bannings” have taken place in the past that we’re also incorrect? If CCP can knee jerk into crapping on a CSM member, then what hope do any of us F1 monkeys have... I hope there is blood on the carpet in some dark office in Reykjavik.
---
&gt;it’s now clear that our initial actions were based on unsubstantiated assumptions.
---
Wait, didn't the previous blog post say something about "Thanks to the CSM members that brought this to our attention"
---
Sooo, CCP got metagamed or something?

How would you have wanted them to handle it ?

Nobody who ever flew with any of these guys bought any of that horseshit for a second lol
---
Much like our livers did during CSM 11
---
&gt;providing rectification as appropriate
---
As in, we're currently determining how much money we need to pay Brisc for the defamation.
---
Can't imagine those memes aren't purposefully pre-made
---
What a fucking shitshow. I was going to run for CSM as a wormhole candidate, but I now no longer trust CCP to treat me with respect.
---
no i dont think he ever publicly admitted it but i could be wrong.
---
i think part of why his was more quiet was because he had already quit the game a long time ago but he was still a csm member that was removed from the csm and ccp handled it very differently to how they handled brisc.
---
I believe that your mother is a whore. 
---
Also Yay for brisc!
---
welp
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Ahhh, the good ole Twitch maneuver.
---
I'm glad they admitted the mistake, but it does make me wonder how many other ppl have been banned wrongly over the years, who never got a second look.
---
So pleased that charges were cleared.   
---
Wonder if all those publications that were so quick to condemn will now print retractions?
---
Bring back Stunt.
---
Let us not lose sight of what is important. Brisc is still a massive douchenozzle. This new ruling from CCP doesn't alter that.
---
The manliest thing that ccp did for a very long time. Admitting wrong.

If you keep on going through life hating on everything like this, you won't Laz very Long.

Well, yea.. I made dozens over the last week or two just having fun with it.
---
still a little strange about the other csm members pushing for some thing that meta gameing that resulted in it
---
He watched too much anime, there is no turning point after that
---
Yes, but you must follow the teachings of the Initiative. It is a dangerous path, one which leads towards the Stuka side.
---
Gin and tonic contains fruit and is therefore considered a healthy breakfast
---
As someone who thinks that Briscs understanding of the game and the substance of his posting both equate to those of an hot air blower, I am appalled by the sheer incompetence and idiocy displayed by CCP, conducting such an public execution without having done their proper research first.

So what has happened to CCP Dopamine?

Out of curiosity, what happened in 2009 that, if I read correctly between your lines, has killed piracy?

can you instead start focusing on banning all the BOTs?

a lot of luck then?

Now to wait for the Naz post...
---
I wonder if all the news articles that used Brisc's real life name to accuse him of NDA breaches are going to print retractions now!
---
What a ride!
---
Do we get an punishment of the CSM Snitches falsely accusing Brisc ? Some public Burning/Witchhunt before the Theta DickButt Keepstar?
---
From a purely PR perspective that would have been better most likely. I do wonder if there will be anything on the subject of whoever brought this up.
---
One wonders if they fell for faked Discord logs.
---
Probably nothing, unless the party involved fabricated evidence.  You aren't supposed to get in trouble if you report something suspicious.  The authorities (CCP in this case) are supposed to investigate, not go in there shooting first and asking questions later.   This is entirely on CCP.

The answer is of course no, just look at Stunt.

4/9 chance that would mean boosh ravens to the 1dq keepstar.

So, it's ridiculously blingy, but OP's question asked about *any* ship and not about a practical ship (for practical use, take a hecate with 4 lowgrade nomads or 4 faction istabs, it's got 25% of the tank but people don't generally smartbomb 30k ehp ships on gates anyway). The way it works is you switch to propulsion mode while jumping (which is possible with t3 modes) and warp off in 0.9s and switch to defense in warp if you're feeling like you're going to be smartbombed and activate overheated hardeners when landing on grid for a cycle or two. It requires decent reactions to get the most out of it, but even without heat/defensive mode, it's still nigh-ungankable at 54k ehp).

How in the hell do you very publicly kick a CSM member and issue permanent bans without substantiating the claims first. Years of time people have put into this game can be completely wiped out in an instant because of assumptions is awfully scary.

Not saying they should also run an apology, but it’ll never happen.

In case it isn't clear, they tried to remove him because he's an useless person adding nothing to neither the game nor the CSM. The fact that it failed is certainly not a victory for the rest of EVE, including his own alliance

Conduct a full investigation, gather the facts, interview potential witnesses and come to an informed conclusion before passing judgement.    
---
Clearly the ban, regardless of it being rescinded, can have a negative impact of /u/deltaxi65 's real life career as a result of him being labeled as someone who violated an NDA.    
---
Also, they effectively lopped off Init's right and left hands in banning Pando and Shines.  Banning an alliance's number 1 and 2 FCs for a year is a gaping wound to any alliance in practicality.
---
The statement seems to indicate that whoever reported him acted properly
---
Congrats CCP, you can never credibly ban anyone ever again.  Unbelievable that they would jump the gun on something this big.  If this is the care with which they investigate a CSM member, imagine how careless they are with the little people.
---
Oh shit here we go again lmao
---
CCP likely is retraining his receptors.
---
Pray I don't alter it any further.
---
I am astounded at CCP's incompetence,  Brisk and co's account represent years of work and thousands of USDs of investment just to be thrown in the bin on a hunch. This screams that all previous bans (e.g. Novak who has been screaming for a fair trial  for months) were handed out without due process.

People should be concerned that someone or some people on the CSM conspired to headshot an alliance. I'm sure everything's fine though, just like everything was correct when CCP sent the ban to begin with. Nothing to see, right?

From a PR perspective they did all they could. They received bad intel, made a mistake, release a statement about it being under review then apologized, I don't know what they could have made better. People make mistake, you can never prevent that.
---
never said any of those things
---
I think the real question is what information was CCP given that was good enough to ban them without even looking into the accusations?
---
But is it one of your 5 a day?
---
Fantastic! Didn’t believe CCP had it in them to walk it all back. Shows character from Grendel and co.
---
I was thinking the same thing.  Although I'm glad they have put the truth out there, they havent given us the entire truth. Was this information really given by a CSM member and if so, which one? After the name and shame of the accused, the accuser should be as well. Or did CCP just use the CSM's name for their own reasons. Not like they havent done it in the past.
---
Someone said this was an attempt by CSM members that actually contribute (like you or suitonia) to remove Brisc because he doesn't know EVE enough to be able to contribute or something and it started making people angry that actually give a lot of their time to try and better the game.
---
I know you won't comment but if that's the case, it was still a nice try and for at least a couple of days, I felt like the CSM could actually change into something productive. Brian basically strong-armed CCP into further admitting the CSM isn't here to represent anything or anyone actually

It smells of someone wanting to show that CCP didn't need a full community team or Guard and they wanted to make their mark.
---
Unfortunately, in their enthusiasm to make a mark legal didn't get told about their actions in full, hence the walk-back. They might've even been able to stand by claiming it was EULA related if they hadn't outright said it was an NDA breach.

How does that crow taste?
---
&gt; Can't CCP reverse engineer the bot, look for characteristic behaviour, then just mass ban all of them?
---
I'm sure they can. They can do a ton of stuff, send them fake signals that a bot will react to but a player will not just for starters, etc. They can flat out disable them just by spawning a single neut ship in their system and cloaky park it, rotate the spawns. The bot owner charges $$$ all you have to do is make a payment, track it, investigate, make a report then report it to the CC companies for fradulent activity which it is. That alone will be a huge blow. It isn't that they can't it is that they don't want to.
---
Sincerely sorry Brisc got banned while being innocent. Really hope he’ll be guilty next time.
---
so all those RMT/bot accounts Peligro tweeted about recently were all illegitimate bans?
---
Lmfao thanks for that. Made my morning
---
And this is why it makes no sense to link your personal accounts to your Eve account if you're a real life politician. What's the benefit from it compared to the risk? Seems hugely lopsided on the risk side of things.

CCP big yikes from me dawg
---
Why do you think i typed "they can burn their own dicks"?
---
Man, that must have been really hard to accept.
---
I wonder what will happen with the future CSM interactions during Brisc's term... and what the fuck was all the "the rest of the CSM told us about this".
---
Where I come from false accusations that generate prejudice to someone are dealt with harshly.
---
I need to get a wisdom tooth pulled, so I don't think I'm going to make Toronto. Still planning on Vegas, and I'm thinking about London, too.
---
Your bad
---
Good, still got the karma :^ )
---
However, you can do due diligence on an investigation before pulling the trigger and making a public statement.
---
the important lesson from this is that we made friends and had fun, right?
---
I doubt you actually read the post. He is absolutely right.
---
Oh you sweet summer child.
---
Enjoy the break.
---
How about temp ban someone, communicate with them to say that they have been temp-banned they are under investigation and they have some questions, investigate all the evidence and then, if you find that they have done something wrong, then make a big public statement?
---
You say that but I guarantee you 100% that none of the major publications that reported this will come back with a correction.
---
What did Sargon call them... "dirty, dirty smear merchants".
---
So it goes...
---
Well what if they did an investigation that was done mistakenly ?
---
I doubt it. They probably acted upon honest concerns and put 1 and 1 together to make 69 so someone could make their mark as the champion of the community now Guard's gone.

Glad to be back.

Man, if CCP could fuck up this bad with a member of the CSM, imagine all the random nobodies who get falsely banned with no viable recourse...
---
I got big billys to advertise jibrish
---
I appreciate this. Thanks, Leg.
---
"Resign" ;)
---
Which one?
---
Sure, the criticism has to do with him being a goon, not him being completely unsuited for the position as CSM. Bless your heart
---
except /u/bugme143
---
Can't wait for all the apologies from the people blindly shitting on brisc in the original thread.
---
THE INIT 3 ARE FREE!!!!!!
---
I am not an RMTer.
---
All in favor say AYE
---
OK, so CCP made a serious mistake and fixed it.
---
Question: did CCP *learn* from that mistake?
---
Glad to be back. As much as this place drives me crazy sometimes, you've all grown on me. I can't wait for part 3 of Naz's trilogy.
---
This isn’t a mistake. It appears to be a colossal fuck up
---
ITT : Far too many folks THANKING CCP for being incompetent bozos because HERPADOO DEY WERE HOENST BOUTS IT
---
Find the snitch and cut his hands off (in game ofc)
---
He got the insider info before everyone else, someone inform CCP.
---
CCP STILL has not responded to any of my emails or support tickets. Should I send in a legal letter as well?
---
So many people eating their words today. They’ll be full of shit for a while
---
200 IQ tinfoil: This was all an inside job to allow CCP to disband the CSM under the guise of avoiding future controversy.
---
did I hear London?
---
i havent read the replies below, but itll go something like "FFS CCP YOU GUYS SUCK BLAHBLAHBLAH"  
---
congrats Brisc, you didnt violate the NDA...but that discord cringe-shit ....THAT is out in the open now. Plain as day.

---
They can't hire people because most game dev QAs are subhumanly stupid. Been there done that backfills of people with 2 braincells are HARD.
---
Peter Carr, spokesman for the special investigation, declined to comment.
---
What if they pulled the trigger on what looked like collusion without doing an investigation or talking to the affected parties?
---
You guys got any plans to increase your **bot** hunter count lol?
---
Being well lubricated doesn't improve your combat prowess, but it certainly makes for a fun fight!
---
Just like my uncle Steve
---
&gt;Is there any reason why ccp can’t recognise bots and ban the accounts? From a software point of view surely there must be obvious signs when an account is being run by a bot program?  
---
&gt;I know botting means more isk, but do the people running them make real world money?
---
From their post not too long ago (maybe a month or a little more), they have 2 people on it and a 2+ month long queue on bot reports to investigate. They ban roughly 4k accounts per month per security blogs, and this is just bots, not including account hackers etc. That averages to 12.5 accounts per hour per person based on a 40 hour work week. They are supposedly working on more and better automated solutions for this but its either going poorly or not at all. Also with a 2+ month long queue and bots coming back within a week of being banned it just doesn't do much at all. Any botter will have accounts already created and ready to launch for replacement the moment his get banned.
---
What's telling you they haven't done even a partial investiguation before banning them, and why should they warm someone that he is most likely to get banned, that sounds like a really easy way to transfer assets ...
---
it will still get ganked , especially if it has a low sec gate to stain in the hold
---
please get rid of whoever made the call to post that original statement
---
for your own sake ccp
---
NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION
---
This is a great idea! Whenever the next B-R5RB supercar blobfest happens, I'll just jump my JF into the middle of the hostile blob and zap those evil bumpers out of their cap.
---
Never admit your stupidity.
---
Better to let people think you're stupid, than open your mouth and remove all doubt.
---
rip chyna
---
While I don't disagree, I don't see how what that has to do with what I said.
---
wow, really resigning to 'spend more time with the family'
---
So CCP, what will you be offering as compensation given the damage caused?
---
Whoever decides to run for CSM now knows the entire reddit and forum population is literally frothing at the mouth to see them hang for being in the public eye. No thanks to that.

I was wrong about jump fuel but other types of fuel, LO included, can be stored in a ship bay. As far as the economic implications go, LO is an extremely farmable item, so judging based on the market supply of such a useless item isn't very accurate. Ice absolutely shits out LO, so you'd just see ice get farmed more often.

Brisk Rebound
---
Little history.....couple years ago the wormholers began taking sov from the "stupid null bears" humiliating the great null empires.
---
I warned the wormholers it was a bad idea, and was laughed down and taunted to come find their "Fortizar in Thera".
---
Well they forgot they don't have asset safety nor the isk rebuilding capabilities that a null entities has (because game mechanics) so when they began losing Keepstars in their precious wormholes.... welp now they are trying to use null space to rebuild their isk......good planing there wormholers! GG!
---
Is he also quitting eve for unspecified reasons?
---
Fake news :P
---
This whole incident shows how ridiculous the court of public opinion is - so many people decided he was guilty before any kind of evidence showed up. CCP have possibly damaged someone's real-life career over false allegations rather than checking their facts before acting. Granted, it was Brisc who tied his real-life identity to his Eve character, but it should have been taken into account nonetheless. 
---
I feel sorry for all the people who have been unjustly banned but never compensated because they weren't newsworthy enough. I hope CCP learns from this, but it seems to take them an age to make any kind of progress so I won't get my hopes up.
---
I wonder if they are using utensils to help pack that shit down their throat?
---
It was Sort Dragon in the library with the NDA!
---
What I'm suggesting is that CCP pulled the trigger on bans based on rumors and badly timed transactions. Then made a public statement about it. Which is unprecedented.
---
They should have locked the accts quietly and done a full and complete investigation, especially with this level of visibility.
---
There are so many shades of green that haven't yet been made into Gallente skins yet though!
---
Who cares. They are what they eat
---
Healing, or as well call it logi, is an absurdly essential thing in all fights from a small corp roam to a massive alliance op. If you fly with ten people or a thousand they still need kept alive, and you'll be loved for it.
---
There's also support in the form of AOE buffs for allies, but it takes a very long time to train to do that so I'd recommend not going for it until you've gotten farther into the game. Non-damage forms of support include stuff like tackling and pinning down targets for players with bigger guns, electronic warfare to weaken your enemies, or remote assistance modules to improve things like tracking and sensor strength for allies.
---
Eve never ceases to amaze me.
---
at least some good news today
---
Choina!
---
LOL, that pause from 1:13-1:15!!!
---
Never experienced that... scimis I fly are cap-stable, while Nightmares are not. I guess small fleets with 1-2 logis may run cap-boosting logi wing?
---
Honestly the best part about this is the coming Naz redemption arc
---
What are they gonna do to make it right?  How do we know this isn't a ruse cruise by the GSM?
---
Im alluding to the fact that 90% of this sub assumed guilty without a shread of evidence presented towards them and it was all due to pre conceived notions and bias people had of brisc and his RL job and the group he chooses to associate with in game; to put it short, it cause hes black.
---
&gt; We take full responsibility for any confusion and mistrust caused by our initial assessment of the situation.
---
&gt;We take full responsibility 
---
No you don't, because this behaviour and callous disregard will continue to repeat. The **only** reason this even got revisited is because of actual legal implications.
---
LOL
---
The tears, they are delicious.
---
1 donation to my patreon = 1 post
---
ur posting is out in the open
---
This. I want to put this down to a newbie GM, but wow what a cluster-fuck.
---
It just underlines how stupid their handling of this was in the first place.
---
You have no idea if it was a rumor or some data looking a lot like a leak without a deep investigation.
---
good fucking luck
---
What they should have done differently is insert the due diligence investigation in between freezing the accounts and making a giant public stink about kicking a csm member for fucking nda violation. Banning them quickly wasn't the problem. Making sweeping public allegations with no proof was.
---
Did someone say witch hunt? Where's the pitchfork guy
---
Wish they would add a super titan like 1 time deal.  Where if it dies then it won't come back as in you cant rebuild cause of limited and there is only a set amount of bpcs and that's it. Once they are gone they are gone. Might be cool imo
---
The point they were trying to make with their retarded response was that what if's are fucking useless. 
---
CCP screwed up again, theres is no what if here. It's just a matter of when they do it again.
---
We all demand free 1M SP for this fiasco
---
No, it's because he himself has admitted multiple times to not knowing much about ingame mechanics, game meta, literally anything that would make me want to support someone's ideas towards CCP.
---
I know it must feel good to be able to play the INIT. victim card and (rightfully) have a justice boner, but that doesn't change the fact that Brian is the last person I would trust with anything to do with EVE: Online, they guy doesn't have enough understanding of the game yet
---
RELEASE THE REPORT
---
I really wonder who was responsible for the initial "fact-checking" and the resulting ban? I mean, that wasnt some low-profile action, they had press releases/a devblog on the matter. A lot of people should have been involved in all that. And best of all, as Brisc said (and i have no reason not to believe it, especially now), CCP didnt even talk to him before the ban.  I mean he was (is?) a CSM Member, CCP has fast and direct access to him and knows him personally (phone number?, discord channels, etc.). How hard can it be to call him/write a mail/ping on discord and ask about stuff before you swing the banhammer? Total shitshow by CCP, true amateurs at work ;)
---
Geez, I didn't see your comment and said almost exactly the same thing. This is clearly the way it should have been handled.
---
next fuck up please this one is going cold.
---
It was what I heard, never took part in it nor did I pay it too much attention :shrug:  
---
Either way, whether it was an alt of someone in skill or not the outcome was the same anyway
---
If this doesn't prompt CCP to take a serious look at their disciplinary policy, I don't know what will. Nebulous ban reasons, strange confiscations of resources, and an opaque process have been shouted about over and over again here on Reddit; and a lot of people without Brisc's public image would never have got the luxury of an appeal.
---
C H I N A
---
give freighters a panic module f*ck gankers
---
you cant blame the people of reddit, are they meant to believe ccp or the banned ppl who ofc will say hes innocent.
---
So ... 500 mio SP to the innocent? When?
---
I imagine they quite effectively ruined any joy brisk had in what is, in the end, charity work
---
Blame? No. But human decency? Yes. This sub has none of it and I wouldn't want to be a CSM for this bunch of ungrateful louts.
---
Good to see that CCP followed up on what was a very serious allegation and have investigated it thoroughly and have found that they made a mistake and admit that and are doing what’s right and reversing the original actions.
---
They could’ve easily tried to just cover it up and ignore it all but they have admitted it and that gets a big tick from me to the CCP devs.
---
Hopefully there will be better process in place if this ever come up again so that injustice is not served.
---
Heh, why? It's just some dude who got wrongly accused and punished of something he didn't do.
---
That's not a colossal fuckup unless you wish to exaggerate, or simply don't have a grasp on the real world. 
---
Nobody died, nobody got truly hurt, nothing got destroyed, life can go on as usual.

---
COME OUT YE BLACK AND TANS

COME OUT AND FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN!

It is really proving my point when you continue to objectify an ingame character and their ingame actions by using his RL name.
---
Which super did you go with?
---
AYE
---
That Minmatar titan looks like it came straight out of 40k
---
Unlike 70% of the people here.
---
&gt;The idea of a 'dirty' gate is to basically spam the surrounding space with cans, drones, wrecks and ships, so that wherever the t3c may spawn after jumping, it'll always be within the magic 2500m and lose its cloak. This may sound spectacularly difficult but really isn't, especially when done on a non-regional gate.
---
If you do that then the loss gets reimbursed and you get a warning not to do it again. And again, you'd have to have these set up all over the place, because you're never going to have just one gang, and if you spend all your time camping one group they'll either afk or blops out.
---
&gt;And this is a bad thing why? Mining brings with it much the same dangers as ratting does, just ask all the hulk pilots in Delve that die to random Hecates. Exploring leaves you inherently vulnerable as even an instawarp interceptor can and will eventually be caught, just ask all Horde pilots that died to the camp in Korsiki. Abyss is very much not safe in itself and also very much not bot-friendly (not even in a Gila as rats will murderfuck your drones). Oh, and you can also be ganked on exit/warpoff to citadel.
---
Well, its bad b/c you just removed ratting and subcap mining from the game, for all intents and purposes. And with it, all of your targets for roaming. 
---
Mining as in rorqual mining, not normal mining. Without the ability to Panic everything I said about ratting still applies. Either with a rorq on grid to protect everyone, or just getting into a rorq.
---
Explorers only die when they mess up, and least in k space. Campers who cloak in sites, almost without exception, can be found with a quick look into zkill. No one makes a new omega alt for each kill. Gatecamps are trivial to dodge if you're awake, and drag bubbles can be dscanned out if you go to a celestial near the gate instead of warping directly, which should be standard. Sure, they're not invincible, but neither are ratters right now. Look at the zkill for VNIs if you need proof. 
---
Abyssals can be done off a keepstar undock, and in most cases that's not really feasible for a roaming gang to attack. The bwf keepstar would be an exception, but pretty much every other major alliance wouldn't have that problem. For corps not at war, dead pockets of hisec would still be used. Not much changes there. As for bots, the only reason you don't see abyssal bots is you don't see anyone doing abyssals. They really aren't complicated, especially below t4s, and they're pretty much 0% risk in hisec.
---
If you didn't believe CCP when they said he did something, why do you believe them when they said they made a mistake?
---
The investigation should have been done thoroughly BEFORE any action was taken
---
Just bash the pos dumbo
---
your part of this sub aswell whether you like it or not. 
---
*Part of the ship, part of the crew*
---
What comments do you think violated 'human decency'?
---
I'm not a big logi pilot, but it's a hell of a lot more interesting than anchoring up and pressing F1 on the FC's target. Juggling locks and choosing who to rep is part of the fun in my opinion; you're overcoming (admittedly UI-imposed) limitations and helping out your fleet-mates.

I think it would be nice to have more people not chafing at the bit to shit down your throat.
---
Be kind and compassionate then, most of the community playing this game are damaged people
---
The context was if a new Eve server was created 20 veterans would still defeat 100 new players. While that is true the 100 newbies would on this server at least only be behind in terms of experience, not also 15 years of skills and funds.
---
I put in a support ticket a year ago about a bug that allowed multiboxing alphas, was told it was known and was being worked on, was reminded about it yesterday and the method I described in the ticket still worked. it was support request #717502.
---
i think you'll find that a substantial portion of r/eve likes to just shitpost about CCP and brisc simultaneously, myself included
---
I do though lol
---
Careful, Brisc is a man of many drinks!
---
considering most of the CSM are allies, yeah
---
But then he rolled the stone beside and walked out of the tomb, reborn. Resurrected.
---
Fucking unreal. I literally cannot process how CCP can be so fucking stupid.
---
Did this whole thing make you feel like you don't want to play EVE anymore though? I probably would have walked away even if I had been unbanned in your situation.
---
Okay CCP, you can tell us now who the csm snitches were , making those false accusations.
---
Welcome back brisc
---
So who will make the /r/Subredditdrama post
---
hes just taking a break
---
Isk sent
---
As far as real life career: no, nobody in their narrative culture cares. The American Republican party is not exactly known for due diligence on this stuff, and Republican voters absolutely don't have a care in the world. If there was any major press about it, CCP would be dealing with attacks for a while then move on. They have been infamous worldwide for this style of politicking for about 40 years now.
---
&gt; when they do it again.
---
Heh, tell me about it.
---
Woah please share with us the information none of us have then
---
Nice, but in my experience, its the sole purview of the slow of mind to quote people they think of wit. A smart person always speaks their mind.
---
Further it should be the intent, of all Americans to become a language onto ourselves. Or inflict ourselves with our culture, and thus be able to define the greater separate from the whole English squall.
---
Banning a CSM member without a public statement would have been retarded
---
I'm shocked as to how blatantly INIT is playing the victim card. Did Brisc actually fool an entire alliance into thinking he's needed on the CSM and his great contributions would have been missed?
---
Guy knows nothing, it's all a meta game to him and he uses that a platform to jerk himself off. I can't fathom how you can stand behind him, to me it's legit incredible. EVE players are usually not the kind of people i'd expect to be this collectively dumb
---
Stou ajoind lowsec and the guy regularly hunts explorers in lowsec.
---
So pretty much just retarded.
---
Have done it myself, so have been just as retarded.
---
I thought a lot about this, but in the end, there's like a month left in this term, it's the start of summer for CCP and things get quiet, and I didn't want to run again.  You guys have no idea how tough this was on my family, and I'm not going to put my wife through another campaign this soon after all the drama. 
---
Maybe I'll run again in the future. And I'm still going to play the game.

---
just morons
---
anyone who has any longevity in eve knows ccp's bans are like only accurate or justified 50% of the time
---
Ill violate YOUR decency.
---
im not sure ccp is gonna leap right into another bout of naming and shaming people
---
&gt; I cannot fathom how they possibly could have handled this worse.
---
...said every EVE player until CCP enlightened him that \*\*yes\*\* they can \*\*always\*\* handle it worse next time.
---
https://imgur.com/iytJTfv.jpg
---
Year they do.  A mate of mine got a two week ban because he login on his laptop.
---
I am on the fence. It is a personal choice to tie yourself to an online persona and actively promote that connection. Especially when you're in a high-profile function. I do not believe that it is the job of CCP to adjust their policies based on whatever a player connects outside of the game, to their online activities. It would lead to special treatment, which is a very slippery slope to slide onto.   
---
That does not mean that CCP's mistakes aren't bad. But I do not think we need to make any "special" rules because a player willingly and proactively ties their personal life to their online persona, with all the assumed risk that may entail. That's on the player.
---
daddy
---
Well, it won't really matter one way or the other.
---
On the *rare* occasion the media runs retractions, they're almost never remembered. *Especially* in the current political climate. That's why initial media stories are so damaging.
---
At least to my knowledge no major publication acted in bad faith when first reporting the ban.  It wouldn't surprise me at all if they wrote another article about Brisc's exoneration too - why wouldn't they? It's more clicks and the followup is just as interesting as the original news. In fact, Pcgamer updated their article when CCP posted about their investigation and polygon actually wrote an article about that announcement. It's pretty safe to assume they will continue to cover this story. So yeah, that '100% none of the major publications' is going to be hyperbole at best. 
---
Re: Sargon - Pot meet kettle. Guy is pretty well known for misrepresenting news articles and ignoring context to further his narrative. And unlike actual news outlets that often rely on external sources, in his case it's all his own doing.
---
I have already replied this on the original thread but I’ll say it again. It won’t happen. 
---
What story title gets more clicks 
---
Or
---
“We made a mistake after a game company made a mistake”
---
Unless they legally have to they won’t do it.
---
And legally all they did was report on a story, not wrote it themselves.
---
I’m not saying they shouldn’t..... but it won’t happen
---
Now free gigX
---
Steve, you want some  dick to eat? I got a bagfull just right here.
---
are you a salesman? you sound like the guys from our sales department that loooove to throw buzz words around. "game changing software", "cloud computing", "[insert produt name] as a service" and most recent: "machine learning"
---
CCP can hardly implement worthy content at a glacial pace and you expect them to pick up on machine learning for countering bots?
---
Lol, didn’t expect this, but it should have been obvious on r/eve
---
It's like CCP loaded up a shuttle with all their credibility and undocked from Jita.
---
Still better than Bioware's handling of Anthem.. so they got that going for them.
---
&gt; Lmao wtf am i saying, they botting fam, YEET
---
bless
---
Dude y u ignore me on Discord
---
yo
---
CCP can’t force people to notice,  but after taking such extraordinary steps when announcing the ban, they should take extraordinary steps when revoking and apologizing
---
i think it is more like 'this shit is not worth it'
---
in alpha state
---
At least they had the stones to come forward and admit they were wrong.
---
Its an interesting story, they still haven't gone into detail about their evidence. I don't believe they should throw whoever they got their information from under a bus, but they should come forward with why they thought Brisc had broke the rules.
---
Welcome back Init dudes.
---
This is worrying for the little guys. If you have 0 influence you can be wrongly banned and done.
---
man i KNEW these "charities" feeding "starving kids in africa" were a scam! these kids' bellies were waaaay to big to be starving!

Thank you for being a newly valued customer of CCP Games. As recompense for hundreds of companies around the world dragging your real life name through the mud, we are gifting you the following items in game:
---
1. Two weeks of in game "Omega" time.
---
2. 1 million skillpoints.
---
Thank you for being a member of the EVE Online community.
---
I agree that’s what should’ve been done and hopefully that will be their pathway for any future situations like this
---
Amen.
---
They will not give that information.
---
Why? Because while it may be interesting to you, it also undermines many internal policies that are designed to ensure the security of both the business and the customers. A lot of methods to determine "illegal" behaviour are kept under strict NDA because it would otherwise enable people to find loopholes and abuse it. Furthermore, the information included still falls under an NDA that is signed for a large reason because it has a business impact on their operations now and in the future. If CCP would publish any in-depth details, they would effectively annul the NDA's protections on that subject, which may result in significant business-related problems.  
---
You'll very likely never see any details ever.
---
Brisc, can we get a reaction YouTube post with even more booze and high quality banners on the walls?
---
jesus christ...wait a minute...
---
On the *rare* occasion a corporation falls on it's own sword, suggesting that they stand up and run into a wall with it for good measure is asking a lot.
---
naz scammed me for few Nightmare BPCs under the pretext of "Stain propaganda" :D
---
What StainGuy said.
---
Pretty sure it was just him that people wanted to see hang because his posting was bad and arrogant but ok
---
How many other players have been unfairly banned tho and didn't have Brisc's clout? What a shit show CCP.
---
Glad to have all 3 of the players back.
---
If this isn't a metaphor for all of EVE I don't know what is.

CCP thinks it knows best, takes action, fucks things up so badly people end up walking anyway.
---
The Herald must speak!
---
&gt; why wouldn't they?
---
You're new to the internet?
---
So what did they think you did?
---
"A miner in a T2 barge!! Going for it!!" 
---
[Oops](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74458361/)
---
Wormholer btw
---
Rock on. I'm glad that's somewhat cleared up.
---
&gt; Hell i think bots in null is smaller  % than in HS.
---
Thing is, that perhaps with exception of market bots, HS bots make pennies. FW bots make out OK, but not great, NS bots is where its at. Outside of marketing most HS bots are bots whose skills are just being trained before being moved to NS. Sure, there are bots in HS but you need to make and run 10 of them or whatever the numebr to make same ISK per hour that a single NS bot makes. 
---
This makes them much easier to spot, also because HS has much more players then NS and is more dense in general, they can't stay for too long because they get spotted by everyone real easy.
---
&gt; Sooo, CCP got metagamed or something?
---
That is correct.
---
Just that they never bothered to even talk to the people supposedly involved before deciding they were guilty was a real headscratcher..
---
Hahaha what the fuck
---
He's the one to bring his RL persona in the game and running for CSM based on his RL politician job
---
How can you give me shit for "objectifying" him when it's exactly that "objectifying" that got him the CSM spot
---
Also how does it even halfway prove your point?
---
Still waiting for the draft that the judge was supposed to be writing up
---
You forgot the giant plex ad right below
---
Fuck I really hate upvoting globby but dam it! 
---
Fire CCP, Free Stunt.
---
So where are the CSM members that started this shit? Did CCP not originally say it was opposing CSN that made this claim? Where is their ban? 
---
Oh right, CCP don’t Ban NC/PL 😂
---
I didn't necessarily disbelieve CCP at the time.
---
That said I did have more of a "wait and see" attitude while everyone else was rushing for the tar and feathers. I had some doubts mainly because they didn't talk to the guy which means there was no opportunity to clear up any misunderstandings.. something I could see happening. 
---
On the other hand it's a lot harder to craft a narrative where CCP humiliates itself and does a huge amount of damage to it's reputation to exonerate a guy if they know he's guilty.
---
Na, he's saving that for the metashow or TiS.
---
TINFOIL IS HERE BOIS!
---
Brisc made a deal with CCP to be unbanned he had to be removed from CSM but he got to make it look like he resigned!
---
Never any doubt!
---
free stunt
---
They have unbanned people before without any explanation, they shouldn't give it now
---
&gt;Looking into now.  our focus has been at war atm. Please if anyone see something suspect while going into Winterco space please message me in game. IGN thinning ice Ty

---
CCP is a complete and total joke and I am glad I don't give them money any more. I hope this humiliation stings hard and forces them to rethink their approaches to community management.
---
Actually there was far more, “He’s an evil Republican! It’s in his nature to do that stuff” going around this sub than the goon thing.

Of course we were going to cover it.

I've already requested his presence.

---

---
It's not about the money, it's about the message. Seems like they are getting away with a "We're sorry" blog post.
---
i mean, you were put in the role of the dragonborn so the stage is set already for this outcome :thinking:
---
Commenting for proof I was here.
---
frankly i am shocked, shocked i say!
---
there's precedent for banning a csm member without an announcement.
---
Damn you work fast.
---
"fuck, lawsuit? Ok, nevermind" -CCP
---
tbf to CCP, they admitted their error and made it good. More than a minority of MMO publishers would have doubled and quadrupled down on it.
---
I mean it makes sense. The entire sub didn’t believe him when he said he was innocent because he is a republican politician. He was immediately crucified instead of waiting for a more official report from CCP. I’d quit too after all of that.
---
I agree. For me it’s the 15 years of experience that’s going to do it.
---
It’s great to have the skills, you also have to know how to use them.
---
Seconded. In fact, I have a feeling you won't be buying a drink at an Eve meet for quite some time after this.
---
I honestly had faith in CCP to not permaban a CSM member before carrying out an investigation. 
---
Looks like they can't even reach that extremely low bar though. Wonder how many of the 50 chars Peligro banned the other day were innocent?
---
CCP went full retard.
---
Never go full retard.

We've got some BAD HOMBRES in the CSM and we're gonna get 'em out
---
&gt; It's definitely more of a mentality than anything else.
---
That’s my idea. I would compare it to giving the same equipment to new Marine recruits and Navy SEALs. It’s the same equipment, the SEALs will know what to do with that. Skill point wise there’s not going to be much of a difference.

Confirmed this - lost a few bubbles trying and had the botters laughing at me in local. Jokes on them though...a couple times their bot fucked up and left them tethered on the citadel afk, so I bumped them off slowly and killed them.

hahah im retarded

Well then welcome back! I am pleased to have been wrong.
---
Hi5 brisc))))
---
I love Signal Cartel!
---
I hear so many good things about you :-).
---
I need to find my way there. I want to play a different kind of EVE.
---
Doesn't work - tried it. I even put a Dscan out of range.  
---
I also tried log off traps with a saber, but they are in warp before I even come out of E-warp.
---
I work on a support desk for a living.
---
Having so many support tickets open unable to be attended to, to teh point where you need to *mass close* them *without doing any work to remedy* is incredibly poor.
---
You either need more staff or a complete change of management.
---
It's a very important story and I knew that this statement was coming because of what CCP said last week, so I've kinda been primed and ready to fire for a few days now.
---
Well, yeah but the people reading bug reports are not the same that answer on support tickets.      
---
I don't know if your suggestion is feasible without loading even more work on the people who are supposed to fix bugs.
---
I have to admit i made that reply from memory, back when faction forts were announced the question came up.
---
I think most people know it was KillahBee at this point...
---
Definitely not unbent, though.

---
LOL This is why I subscribe to this sub.  There has  never been a faster 180 on someone in the history of the internet.
---
In fairness, I think a lot of people had the hope that the people who run the game we ~~love~~ ~~enjoy~~ play wouldn't've banned Brisc without solid evidence considering how they often respond to reports of botting etc. by saying nothing can be done as it's circumstantial.
---
I think even the most jaded bittervet wouldn't've thought CCP would be this bad a bad.

---
&gt; The entire sub didn’t believe him when he said he was innocent because he is a ~~republican politician~~ lobbyist.
---
So, yeah. Get fucked.
---
Good to be back.
---
So each person banned has to threaten a lawsuit
---
&gt; I doubt ccp would just blindly believe someone that just "said" something and ban 3 guys because of that.

Maybe you should stop posting
---
It's still libel. You can't be sued because they aren't a political party?
---
This is what makes Eve great!
---
&gt; CCP don't owe them shit lmfao
---
You wanna re-evaluate that assessment?
---
If you cause damage IRL (as seemed possible at one point), you could get sued IRL, which would be both a worse PR problem and a more expensive RL problem.
---
A game that wrongly got a lawyer disbarred would be in deep doo-doo.

---
You should watch more InfoWars before trying to put on Tinfoil, low effort no logic.
---
I've lost so much respect for CCP...
---
&gt; investigate a breach of a legally binding NDA with care?
---
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
---
Yeah, the whole "Neither Brisc Rubal nor the other players implicated in this incident breached CCP’s confidentiality, the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, or used privileged information to obtain an in-game advantage" apparently wasn't clear enough for some folks.
---
S1E7 of The Orville (Majority Rule) should be required viewing.
---
did u try turning it off and on again
---
He is risen!
---
&gt; When it comes to legal stuff like this CCP has always been very thorough.
---
Sure thing buddy.
---
That'd be your lack of a spine friendo
---
It is a very nice killmail.
---
My favorite tinfoil theory now is that the Goons hatched a plan to try and take out init leaders so they could widot the rest of the alliance.
---
If a game threatens RL in the way that this incident did, yeah, you gotta back off.
---
He should quit the game altogether. Use this as a platform to escort other Eve players into other game universes. If he stays, he's a bitch.
---
CCP will instead ban a few ignorant players who bought a plex, they didn't know was not legit.
---
Other players not important, only bots important!
---
Nice
---
Not many people are dumb enough to tie their irl identity to a character in a game.
---
You can JC to thera?

For someone who doesnt like renters you are working with a group who has and does run a rental program.

---
You are awesome! Logistical ships are always on demand in fleets.

I had my doubts, not because he is a Republican, but because he was a CSM.
---
What do they say
---
Any publicity is good publicity
---
Yeah and I'm pretty sure people asked for a statement at the time.
---
Nah they don't
---
You were waiting for that weren't you. Yeah I was wrong in this case.
---
Dopamine wrote it but that always felt to me like it was Falcon saying "So you've taken over from Guard, eh? You're going to have to write this up, then..." before taking out a paddle and initiating (pun intended) a hazing.
---
&gt; EVE players are usually not the kind of people i'd expect to be this collectively dumb
---
you clearly haven't played EVE for long enough or you didn't get around much.
---
The Siege of Yulai was when a bunch of smartbomber battleships with a flock of logis repping them (which also explains the "criminal assistance" change) were able to tank CONCORD's response ships indefinitely.
---
An important distinction many people miss is that CCP only mod-power-deleted their ships and furthermore banned the players' accounts because after a while and realizing they would never fall to CONCORD ships, GMs said "okay guys, good show, now knock it off". And they didn't.
---
So they killed the ships, banned the players, and came up with some lore-y Jovian one shot kill superweapon used in all future incidents.
---
Tl;Dr they were banned not for griefing in and of itself but because they griefed with an exploitive level that broke the spirit of the game. The few bittervet "ban suicide ganking" carebears like to point at this as proof CCP has banhammered HS griefers before, but again, it was not the act itself but the circumstances around it.
---
how is that comment wrong? I had no reason to believe he was innocent. 
---
I stand by the opinion that cheaters shouldn't play lol.
---
I will be appearing on Open Comms tomorrow night, so tune in.
---
Give freighters the option to asset safety their cargohold /s
---
CCP/PA have some litigation incoming, I assume.
---
I'm really sad they have a CAS-class Assault Carrier but not the larger CSO-class Supercarrier.
---
In the immediate aftermath, yes. I cleared out my office of all my EVE related stuff. After time went on, I started going through withdrawals. Not that I know that this is done, I'm looking forward to logging in again.
---
No, one of the people banned has to have an actual case they could proceed with. Brisc could still pursue a case against CCP if he wanted, the damage is done and CCP has to hope it's dropped instead of followed up on. 
---
You can threaten whatever you want but without any weight behind that threat, it doesn't mean anything. I could threaten you with a good time but I know it would just be a disappointment for both of us.
---
But CNN assured me that because his is similar to Ruble, it was proof he'd colluded with Russia! This can only mean Russia got to CCP. Release the full report!
---
Yep. Iirc
---
The ones I killed in wicked creek (listed by OP) were programmed to kill bubbles/sabres so I just tested their timer until I find out exactly what it is, then bookmark a spot 20km away from their last ratting anomaly in line with their pos/citadel and either log off there or jump in next system if there are no eyes. 
---

---
Killed and reported about 150-200 in a few months in a simple garmur but got bored since there is no stopping them really. And CCP doesn't seem to care either.
---
How many hits will this get vs the original?
---
I really am curious, but I gotta think it's human nature that an accusation gets more traction than a vindication.
---
In any case, thanks for getting this end of the story out promptly.
---
Hi I'm CCP, welcome to jackass

---
Remember whenever he made an announcment about not going to Eve Vegas because people didn't like him?
---
I wonder why people don't like him
---
A lot of the sub simply didn’t hear him out strictly because he was republican. It wasn’t everyone, but that opinion was always highly upvoted.
---

---
Include me in the screenshot
---
They are poor. We'll just use a DTU and get 10.
---
Assuming this is the truth of course.
---
Given the situation it’s hard to take anything coming from them reliably right now. Feels fucking shameful because there’s nothing they’ve done for themselves here and the tiny handful of us that were willing to stand up and think they might not be catastrophic fuckups are now all burnt.

Thanks CCP. Really appreciate the bang-up work you did.

I would be extremely curious to see what evidence anyone has to this. Unless we are just throwing names out, I blame The Judge
---
There was a lot of 'There's no smoke without fire' too as you'd've hoped CCP wouldn't ban someone without credible evidence.
---
At this point, it'd be better for an absolute nobody to stand for CSM and not risk any in-game or IRL reputation loss. You can't lose rep if you don't have any...
---

---
im not sure that was ever the case, I personally had read up on this some as it went down and never knew his party. many folks enjoy putting their own political spin on things these days. for what reason? im at a loss as it just muddies the waters.
---
it's doing a great job :)
---
I haven't been in TEST for a while. But I do get what you are saying. I left when the rapid expansion of numbers in the alliance diluted the existing culture as well as caused havoc in fleet discipline.

I RES tagged him after those.

Lol. Grow up

&gt;Will you cry to your mom when the bans don't get lifted?

Seems like you're the one that's crying now. Need a Kleenex?
---
Yes clearly this is the combined action of the GSM and the GIA to influence CCP
---
RIP community team.....
---
Nice work!
---
...wormholer btw
---
I doubt it. Brisc had said previously that he would be happy with an apology. However, I would imagine that would also include a review of all procedures that could have lead to this outcome and it wouldn't rule-out litigation against any publication that doesn't publish corrections following the media circus.
---
Not crying, can admit i was wrong though, would you have done the same?
---
Gaming journos wont touch this considering the person in question has the wrong political opinions.
---
Baseless accusations resulting in slandering a person seems to be the norm these days. What happened to producing actual evidence instead of utilizing hearsay? This seems to be happening more and more and isn't consistent with western values.
---
Charity work that comes with an "elevated" player status, insight into CCP's company, a paid trip to Iceland, and all that for a person that knows nothing about the game and game mechanics.
---
Sounds like a good deal to me lmao

I'll be honest here and also admit my mistake. I blindly believed CCP when all this first surfaced. I thought that with that kind of information against someone there was absolutely no way that CCP could have fucked it up, but they did...and they fucked up hard.
---
I feel like an asshat for letting the wool be pulled over.
---
so instead he didn't get caught and was accused of doing it? is that somehow better?
---
When I was there I observed that it was a downward spiral effect.

Skirm fc's repeatedly welped, linemembers emoji pooped on their pings as well as avoided those fc's fleets, those fc's would then pull less and less pilots, the emoji poops would grow, and on and on.

---
I believe they all have to legally publish a correction but that doesn't have to be of equal size or weight so it will probably be missed.
---
However, to ensure those companies follow due process, I agree with the OP that CCP should be pro-active and advise all publications that they know ran the story of the correction. At the very least it could keep them on the good side of the press.
---
They'll move on as if it never happened.
---
If it took them only a week to realize they fucked up, they definitely didn't do "all they could", stop apologizing for their incompetence.
---
You had no reason to believe he was guilty.
---
If someone ever accuses you publicly of something you didn't do, I hope you remember the time you threw it right back in someone's face.

I hope they get the same amount of traction because, when following up on sensitive stories like this, it's extremely to me that people get the full story.

The Judge was the only sitting CSM member to publicly support Brisc's dismissal and permanent ban, from what I gather.

It is indeed quite poor, but it is also very important to make the distinction that these are not support tickets, but bug reports, which have the purpose of informing us about problems, so that we can fix the source of the problem, and not about providing support to the reporter (even though in some cases we are able to give a bit of advice).

OK I lost. Time to pay my dues. Welcome back Brisc o7
---
I wonder how many people are posting here lambasting CCP who were totally convinced Brisc Rubal was corrupt not long ago. This reddit seems to have done a hard 180.
---
1) That can get very expensive for both parties. Would you prefer to send a message or spend that money on your family?
---
2) I think Brisc stated he was only after an apology anyway so this would have been a part of any settlement if lawyers were involved.
---
As far as i know the CSM is supposed to represent the playerbase. That means they talk to the players and make their voice heard at CCP. To do that you need a solid understanding of the game which he clearly does have. Ontop of that i believe he was the most active csm talking to the community. I would claim he was one of the best csm members we had actually.
---
Had to read the report
---
Guess the foresight of working with people who threw you under the bus like this would make any man walk away after clearing his name. 
---
Thanks for your efforts Brian, we'll fly together soon!
---
American politician?  You mean "Republican politician".  Let's face it, that's what they were all wetting their knickers about.
---
Of course we had. There is no reason to think CCP would do a mistake like this, it should be pretty fucking obvious that this is bad pr for them. 
---
This is a video game, there is no "accuse", there is no court, there is no judge.

Fuck everyone who brought out the "There's no presumption of innocence or need for due process" bullshit after they were banned.
---
I look forward to collecting your (space) corpses.
---
wow f*$&amp; that guy &gt;:|
---
They went full-retard with the original statement.  I mean this whole business has been extremely fishy right from the get-go.  Someone at CCP should be fired for it because at the very least they've got absolutely terrible judgement.
---
They are never going to tell us, and it looks like whoever spread the bullshit is going to go unpunished too.
---
For some reason I read that as meta-gnomed
---
That's fair. Hopefully this was enough that internally they change their ban process. I'm sure there are other players that have been banned on a whim.
---
It's easy for me to say so, because I never had a moment's doubt about Pando or Dark, which in turn made the allegation against Brisc extremely unlikely.
---
Hopefully you've learned something about being a toxic little ape with nothing better to do than shit in your hand and the fail at flinging it.
---
What time?
---
Few things:
---
1. CCP please hire me to handle your public relations, I can do better.
---
2. If CCP is willing to hand out bans on unsubstantiated evidence, it calls into question the legitimacy of any previous ban.
---
3. We should know what the "evidence" was and who reported to CCP.
---
I hear running a magnet over the motherboard makes it run faster. The stronger the better.

---
depends. another brainless spoon fed f1 pusher is bad.
---
No, you’re over reacting a little
---
Obviously CCP needs to release the full report.
---
I wonder where Brisc would grab a woman. Truly, the outstanding kind of person that I want to play this game.
---
^((then again, what with all the criminal eastern Europeans and Chinese, Brisc is probably the least of our worries))
---
You can't force people to read.  :-(
---
Maybe, but a person can sue a company for libel defamation. They don't have to be a political party.
---
Well, now that no one did anything wrong and all that rot, someone come forward and bring us the full story please.
---
&gt;It's easy for me to say so, because I never had a moment's doubt about Pando or Dark, which in turn made the allegation against Brisc extremely unlikely.
---
This just prove you have a just as retarded bias as the one you are accusing me of having. 
---
There was no more reason for you to think they were innocent than there were for me to think they were. The only reason is because they are from your alliance.
---
Hey, if that NDA didn't want to get violated, it shouldn't have dressed that way. It was basically asking for a violation.
---
Objection: Relevance.
---
Whilst that has been speculated on for a long time, what this proves is that CCP don't have a stringent banning policy and it's basically decided on a whim.

Similarly if you have influence you can be unbanned wrongly.
---
Of course life goes on, it’s a video game. However, in our little virtual world, they publically crucified the parties with a news post and claimed to have the information justifying the ban. Now, apparently there was no such evidence and is now cleared of all charges. After they made such public spectacle of it all due to the fact it was regarding a current csm member and the allegations brought to them from other csm members.
---
There are a lot here who also owe them an apology. The immediate assumption of guilt and the non stop attacks should not have happened nor been allowed.
---
That is EXACTLY how they should have done it. Most players don't know who the fuck this guy even is, nor do they give a crap about this "CSM" nonsense. Apart from those who frequent /r/eve, there would have been 0 visibility on this.
---
No.
---
The space Lawyer won. Glad to see Brisc and Co exhonerated.
---
So Sillychinchilla is openly admitting to benefitting from leaked NDA information?
---
*Interesting*
---
I mean, I did warn him he'd look back on this and regret it.
---
Please, please double down on this garbage, sewer trash like you make this game so much more worth playing for us.
---
That's because most of the playerbase realised that it doesn't matter whether he broke the NDA or not - he's guilty of being an unsuitable CSM self-admittedly lacking game knowledge and having a level of entitlement that can really only come from an old man that even looks like an asshole IRL. And that still is the case, don't let the up/downvotes fool you
---
Could you update the original article with a link to the new one? It will most likely be higher in Google search results then this new one. And it would only be fair.
---
Who knows how literally that statement in the original blog should be taken...
---
Wouldn't be surprised if this ends up being another Meuller-type fiasco tbh.
---
I get the strangest feeling some money got slipped into somebody's hand. Idk why, but its there in the back of my mind.
---
It's pretty suspect to punish someone while claiming all this evidence to support it, and then suddenly turn around and be like "oh we read the evidence wrong/didn't read it closely enough so now he's innocent." That's like a murderer handing a folded note to the police that says "I am the murderer." And after putting him on death row, minutes away from execution, the same police officer unfolds the note to reveal "I am *not* the murderer."
---
Well, I guess we both learned about that now;) ty

On the market part, you made a simple mistake: LO is ALREADY farmed like crazy. Just not voluntarily. But all valuable ice ore does shit out LO, just noone needs/wants LO. Of course the farming of LO would increase, but not in a large margin, as the most efficient LO ice is already farmed for Heavy water and Stront

---
Grats Brisc and the INIT bunch.
---
This sub shit all over him too. Embarrassing and shameful really.
---
Back playing again after an 8-year break and I'm happy to see things are still as toxic and petty as ever.
---
Oh, there should already be one. Huh. Will fix.
---
&gt; I believe they all have to legally publish a correction but that doesn't have to be of equal size or weight so it will probably be missed.
---
Technically they have not reported incorrectly, and there is no law that I’m aware of (in the US at least) that says you can’t be selective about your stories.
---
Unfortunately it looks like brisc is going to be stuck with a bad mark on his reputation whenever his name pops up on google. Best thing CCP could probably do is make sure their correction article gets the best search results in front of the initial reports. Though, that kind of google-fu may as well me magic to me.
---
wow just wow
---
wtf I want a flair
---
&gt;I'm shocked as to how blatantly INIT is playing the victim card. 
---
Uhh, what?  What other card would INIT. play after our two (Arguably, I'll make the argument anyway) most important FC's were banned on a whim.  
---
&gt;Did Brisc actually fool an entire alliance into thinking he's needed on the CSM and his great contributions would have been missed?
---
He got on the CSM the way most do - by running for it.  He'll have more fun playing the game now than he did while he was on the CSM, that's for sure.  You think he was enjoying all the bullshit high-sec missions and content he spent hours and hours testing so that he could meaningfully relay player concerns to CCP?  
---
INIT's concern over Brisc being removed from CSM was dwarfed by concerns over how Pando and Dark were getting royally fucked and the rest of the alliance in turn but it's absurd to even suggest that he wasn't meeting his obligations as a CSM member. 
---
&gt;Guy knows nothing, it's all a meta game to him and he uses that a platform to jerk himself off. I can't fathom how anyone can stand behind him, to me it's legit incredible. EVE players are usually not the kind of people i'd expect to be this collectively dumb
---
You don't know Brisc.  Your comment reflects more on you than him.
---
&gt; There was no more reason for you to think they were innocent than there were for me to think they were.
---
Except for the fact that I've known them personally for years, and it was entirely counter to everything that I'd ever experienced from them or heard about them, whereas you're a buttblasted chump who is forever hurte at any mention of INIT, regardless of source or credibility.
---
And my evidence for this is that I was completely correct and you were totally wrong. GL HF See you in space, I'm resubbing today &lt;3

---
Today I make my final stand
---
__so instead he didn't get caught and was accused of doing it? is that somehow better?__
---
To be clear, I wasn't assuming malice. Merely that someone at CCP was over-zealous. I don't doubt they did it for the right reasons but to go this hard in on someone suggests they wanted to show the community how they were taking a hard-line against cheating and how much they value the institution of the CSM.
---
&gt; The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
---
After all the trashtalking just before getting kicked out of Providence by TEST and totally failing their deployment to attack them he should be used to it.
---
I was referring to Dek pre Goons-GOTG agreement.
---
Quit the straw manning, my point was that krabs contribute and should be respect, an example of which was the low prices/industrial output they provide. See how far an alliance gets without tax income and super building. 
---
Test has more supers than PL, that wasn't always the case, the big difference is Test mine a shitload of ore and produce a lot of supers, PL existed mostly on rental income which doesn't acquire you as many supers.

remember how he whined really bad on Twitter when x47 started to not go his way
---
&gt; You're new to the internet? 
---
Well, it's not like if one of the authors of one of those major publications that initially covered the story already put out a new article updating the story. I mean, he even posted a link to it here... So yes, some publications do actually offer updates as the situation evolves. By the way, at no point did they need to offer a correction in the first place. After all they only reported what happened: CCP banned Brisc and then unbanned him. Those are facts as portrayed by CCP who have absolute say in who they ban and unban. CCP was wrong, not the major publications, CCP offered the correction, the news published an update.
---
&gt;  "actual" news outlets don't misrepresent the facts?  It seems you were born only yesterday 
---
You do know what saying the phrase 'pot meet kettle' references, do you? It's short for 'The pot calling the kettle black'. Or pointing out that someone is a hypocrite. At no point did I claim that actual news outlets never misrepresent the facts, just that Sargon is as bad or even worse then them, depending on the news outlet in question. 
---
In this case no major news outlet that I'm aware of was misrepresenting the facts. At lest the two examples that I gave you - pcgamer and polygon - reported that CCP banned Brisc, that Brisc openly fought the ruling, that CCP investigated, and so far at least pcgamer updated the story that CCP reversed the decision to ban Brisc because they found him innocent. At what point were they misrepresenting the fact or were biased in their reporting?
---
Seems to me you are the one that doesn't have basic media competence and was in fact born yesterday.
---
to someone who is a working adult/professional like brisc, a free trip to iceland is probably near-meaningless money wise.  its a huge chunk of time away from his IRL obligations and career, though

---
Does CCP have to pay to advertise PC Gamer's apology on that hit piece about Brisc?
---
Sounds like a lot of work, and I doubt they're billable hours.
---
It's quite obvious he is an elitist prick of a player and even more of a cunt as a person.
---
Muninn is the 4th best hac
---
I'm very happy to see this result.  Poor Brisc.  Yes, he tied his RL to EVE.  But honestly, there was a much better way to handle this on CCP's end, without totally throwing him and others under the bus, stopping the bus, then backing up over them a few more times.
---
Welcome back to EVE, Brisc and INIT FCs.
---
Utter bullshit.
---
Had absolutely nothing to do with him being a Republican.  Brisc's personality doesn't always win him friends.  Being a Goon makes everyone else happy to see us stumble.  And good luck finding someone other than me who is going to defend lobbying as a profession.  Pretty sure I was the only one in the original threads making that defense.  
---
You think the EVE community is liberal?  Seriously? 
---
In no world is that remotely true.
---
I'm glad CCP did the right thing, even knowing they'd look like idiots.
---
Are you going back to the CSM, Brisc?
---
#LogiOnKillmailsWhen
---
"We had too many tickets so we mass closed them" how is this acceptable? What was the reason you "had" to close them? Missing SLAs? Why not admit you had too many and do your best to work through them? Just another reason I've lost faith in CCP as a corporation.
---
Holy shit its everything I ever hoped it would be.
---
Congrats on getting your accounts back. I know you feel vindicated and probably just want to move past the whole thing,  but this is a situation that could potentially happen to any one of us. Do you feel that any procedures will change based on what happened to you? Did they say anything to that you feel shows genuine contrition and the knowledge that they need oversight? Can you even talk about it freely?
---
There has also been speculation that it was Sort Dragon and both support the theory that someone used their position on the CSM to meta game. Not that I believe one theory or the other, my main point is, CCP's statement doesn't address all the questions or concerns the playerbase has. These actions didnt just affect the Init 3, but CCP has managed to tarnish their reputation and the CSM all at once.
---
^Proof that reddit is better than tickets
---
I must admit, I was basing my assumption off of what I understand about UK press guidelines (not the law, I may note) that suggests that if you later find something to be incorrect, even if you acted in good faith, to publish a correction. Usually this is in a tiny 1 inch section of column on the inside of page 2 where no-one will read it but still...
---
That's right.
---
We're bent AF.
---
Some of us just generally.  But everyone is gay for Pando.
---
Sad, he was doing a better job representing the community then the rest of them combined up until this shit show
---
He’s gonna need a ladder.
---
CCP metagamed themselves either way by not investigating fully which is what many of us realized by the revised statement was them being played. To fuck with a CSM for a violation of those terms without even fully investigating was shooting themselves in the foot regardless of the outcome
---
Sounds like Brisc found a loophole in the law and had an easy case against them, making CCP gold and brushing this under rug. Life is easier as a corrupted lawyer it seems.
---
Please tell me your ways!   
---
Last trip to Iceland cleared out my bank account so I had to live off toast for the next few weeks...
---
Nobody would ever be able to prove they were wrong.  Good luck prosecuting that overseas.
---
So, I can assume CCP will now be reviewing every ban they’ve ever made due to unsubstantiated assumptions? You know in fairness for all of those who don’t have any RL political clout to leverage to force an investigation?
---
b r u h
---
It's probably solid Libertarian bent I would assume, based on the general demographics we know. (Educated adult white males from Western countries with an emphasis in IT-related careers.)
---
&gt; If you do that then the loss gets reimbursed and you get a warning not to do it again. And again, you'd have to have these set up all over the place, because you're never going to have just one gang, and if you spend all your time camping one group they'll either afk or blops out.
---
Bullcrap, it's a valid tactic. What you cannot do is do it 'extensively' so as to create server lag, which is what CCP gets you for. The key is to deploy as little cans as possible, trusting wrecks/drones/ships to do the rest because those are not bannable in the slightest.
---
As for the rest of your post, where do I even fucking begin...
---
You're in Horde, so I don't know what they teach you, well except I do because who does not have a character in Horde in TYOOL 2019? So. Go and ask your NBIs how often do mining fleets die to random roaming gangs. I'll wait. 
---
Ratting can be a group activity too, you know? It's less isk/h which is why no one does it, but it is by no means impossible.
---
Are you expecting me to believe every explorer looks up the zkill of everyone in the system they are about to run a site? As for gatecamps, ayyy lmao, go look at Korsiki zkill. Only camp that's easy to dodge is one run by bads. I've escaped TAPI camps before because no one thought to fit a point, but that's hardly a proof that gatecamps don't work.
---
Regarding ratters, VNIs that die now are either A) AFK and deserving it, B) bad (no align/warp/stuck on rock/pointed by rats) and deserving it or C) have shit intel and shit reactions and can't align in time in which case they fall under B) as it's a preventable issue.
---
As for abyssals, I have by now camped abyss runners in virtually every staging system except 1DQ, but then again, so much blingy shit dies in 1DQ that it's not inconceivable for abyss runners to eat it either. As far as botting, you do know that even in t1 and t2 rats go for your drones like crazy, right? so a gila bot of drop drones approach can shoot can approach gate jump gate would simply eat shit once its drones died. Optimizing pulling drones with keeping dps up is considerably difficult, even for real players.
---
"A lot of the sub simply didn’t hear him out strictly because he was [in the imperium]. It wasn’t everyone, but that opinion was always highly upvoted."
---
fixed it
---
He was falsely accused. That can happen to anybody. He's had a full exoneration from CCP, which means he was clean.
---
Bolding the same random fuckel of words doesn’t magically bestow any clarity on that shit heap of confusion. Your meme would be funny if it were applicable but it’s not and everyone is still asking “what”.
---
UK law doesn't give a single fuck about some character in a game.
---
Yeah, well, it will be news to exactly zero people that Doom is a full of shit scumlord.
---
Probably because they believed CCP wouldn't have done it unless they were 100% certain. I was one of those people. Guess I learned something today
---
&gt;	You guys can’t afford to hire employees to do this ~~after making all that cash on extractors~~ instead of spending your money on new, failing games which will never take off?

FTFY
---
CCP should do a blanket pardon of everyone that’s been banned.
---
Any time you feel like apologizing, I'll be happy to forgive you.
---
"suspended pending investigation'.

That would have solved all of this.

Oh thanks, the lack of bold type-face was really the only thing standing between your incomprehensible statement and a positive reception.

It’s always fun when someone who is a dick also then gets some form of karma but if you’re trying to beg the question by pointing out all the revelers in Brisc’s ban announcement maybe ask why people were so happy it happened in the first place.
---
As I commented before, couldn’t have happened to a nicer dude
---
Not a good look CCP.
---
Done.
---
"Here's 7 days of gametime sorry for the inconvenience" probably?
---
Fuck off with your victim complex.  Republicans deserve a hell of a lot more than what they're getting.  You're supporting a literal traitor who is shredding the Constitution you used to say you cared about.
---
Even during this, [Brisc keeps meta-roleplaying his bullshit politician role](https://i.imgur.com/nPpUhMC.png) , acting like running for an in-game position puts a strain on him and his family. If that is not prime victim playing then I don't know, his dick must be too far in for you to notice anymore. This isn't normal behaviour from neither him or you.
---
What you don't try to understand is that I don't really care about Pando nor Shines. I understand their significance for INIT and that they're content generators, but people saying "this is bad for the entire game" are such entitled fucks that it's shocking. It would only be bad for your alliance, which I could see as a good thing for the game seeing as you're in the game-dominating coalition. I myself am not entitled enough to act like I know whats good or bad for EVE, but I certainly am mad over the fact that such an empty shill, devoid of any advanced skill, gets elected as a CSM solely based on his RL persona as a politician. To me that doesn't seem fair, even though I would never get to a level of entitlement high enough to run for CSM.
---
And thank god I don't know Brisc. The persona he shows to outsiders is already off putting enough, I don't need to have some more insight into it. It also doesn't really matter whether he's a genuinely nice person or not in that case. He just has no place on the CSM
---
And how does that comment reflect on me? That I'm mad that a weasel like Brisc made it off even though he admitted somewhere else that "he knows what he's done but also knows CCP can't prove it"? I'm simply shocked at the sheer amount of people that fell for it

You're an idiot if at this point you still think he's guilty.

A no-context rip from Discord quip is being taken seriously by you only and exclusively because it confirms your priors.

i mean he's a lawyer and a political official, he sounds pretty busy, and just regular working lawyers that aren't involved in other stuff make &gt;$100k pretty easily
---
Genuinely curious why you want a rep like him on the csm?
---
Due to NDA the csm isn't supposed to be discussing things even with people more knowledgeable. Not sure what brisc even offered, apart from being a meme.
---
Yes it's at least trying to. Gimme ONE cumunist charity entity name . Just one
---
Good work. Are you guys taking down the original article? Good chance it might hurt his reputation still, since it shows up much more prevalent due to it being a really high alert topic at the time.

My money is on The Judge. After GigX he simply couldn't pop a boner without getting someone banned from EVE Online. This was gonna be the top, the apex. Getting a CSM member banned. This is how he would finally get diamond-hard now that Naz took his shirtless pic of Mittens.

No contempt or snobbery implied spacefriend. I've been winning eve for years but it still entices me to return every now and again. I wrongfully guessed you were a newer player and was hoping to likewise tantalize you with greater riches as it did me so long ago.

---
Time for a good old fashion Commissarial response.
---
&gt; The road to the CSM is paved with incompetence.
---
I know they don’t have to be a political party, I was simply stating that because they aren’t one you shouldn’t be even thinking about using such measures to potentially take money away from the company that created and is managing a game you clearly enjoy playing
---
The irony of graths post
---
I haven't seen anything suggesting it's a no context rip, to me all it says is he knows he's guilty but also knows he's about to weasel away. Look dude, I can't simply trust you if you tell me "nah he a good guy and not guilty"
---
Also my main point is, even if he isn't guilty, I strongly oppose having him on the CSM and strongly dislike his persona because I really believe he shouldn't be on the CSM. 
---
I'm not trying to be hateful for nothing, I strongly believe he has no place representing me and I also still resent the fact he ran as """""wormhole CSM""""
---
Why do you just insult me instead of trying to show me where I'm really wrong? That reflects more on you than on me
---
Meh, it's step 1 of don't get sued to oblivion.
---
I have never said I know nothing about ingame mechanics, game meta, or anything else. What I've said is that I'm not an FC or an alliance leader, and that I am not some kind of expert. I have the same level of knowledge that anybody who has played the game for 13 years and has done all the stuff that I've done has. Which is more than many. 
---
The fact that even after this, you're still saying stupid shit that isn't true is baffling to me.
---
You rang?
---
I mean. That NDA didn't have to drink the sleepy time coolaid it's uncle handed him before putting on the sponge bob movie and grabbing a blanket....
---
I don't blame you at all, and frankly it might spook alot of people from even considering running for it. Glad to see you back and even more so to see CCP eat some crow on this one. Sorry you and the rest had to be the ones to bear the cross on this one.
---
Welcome back.
---
No, but an update to it has been added that includes this new information and a link to this second story.
---
Because we were merely reporting on what happened (and talked Brisc personally, giving him space to defend himself), we did our due diligence and no retraction is necessary. Everything in that article is factual, aside from the fact that he is no longer banned which, as I said, is corrected with the update.
---
Hope that helps!

Fuck yeah

And I was called dumb for saying there's a not-non-existing chance brisc was innocent.

Curve to the right
---
Vily is away protecting the majestic Canadian moose population.
---
Yo, I've never even played EVE past a run thru the NPE several years ago, but I've lurked (and commented) r/eve since 2012 on various accounts 
---
Can I have a self-deprecating flair too?
---
Lets stick to the matter at Hand.
---
BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE!  Like all the armchair Reddit “lawyers” declaring that Brisc violated VA Bar rules and would lose his license, or the ceaseless speculation about defamation litigation.
---
Speaking of, warning r/Eve don’t even THINK about starting up that shit again for today’s announcement.
---
I AM WATCHING YOU, AND I HAVE FLAIR.
---
&lt;3
---
Ah yes, the white clothes and halo match the bottom-feeding, Trump supporting lobbyist so well...
---
Because I enjoy their game I should look the other way? No.
---
My concern is them posting this "we're sorry" post and forgetting about it, not making the internal changes they need to on their ban process. 
---
Putting them through months of discovery, litigation, and all that other legal talk, I'm sure they'd make the changes so that never happens again.
---
I've spent too much time and IRL isk on this game to be comfortable with the fact one day, having done nothing wrong, my accounts could be banned with zero recourse. 
---
Am I overreacting? Maybe, but I know this is going to be forgotten about in a couple of weeks anyway.
---
You're pleased for us, right?
---
The statement comes after the investigation. Call it a temporary ban pending investigation if that makes it sound better.
---
As everyone in INIT was thoroughly confident in our guys, we have enjoyed watching the monkeys fling poo, knowing that the more they flung, the more they'd have to shovel back up later.
---
How is it "stupid shit that isn't true"...
---
I strongly dislike your persona and the fact you ran as "wormhole candidate" and won based on these two things upsets me. 
---
What am I supposed to think? If I wanted to see you as my lord and saviour, I'd join INIT, but the fact remains I distrust you and your contributions to the CSM and even though I can accept the fact you've been playing the game for long and well, obviously you have to know stuff, why am I supposed to simply forget you already lied once and now blindly trust you that you didn't break the NDA?
---
Like, detach yourself from the imaginary "witch hunt" for a second. I'm a vocal disbeliever of you as a CSM. Why do I have to be the "stupid" here.
---
If you really didn't deserve to get banned, then yeah, of course I support the fact you can play the game that I also love, because I would never question the fact whether you love it or not. 
---
But the issue for me is somewhere else. But because noone can ever know anything, and if you even have the inclination, you can gladly tell me why I'm wrong and "an idiot" for distrusting you.
---
Oh boi. Anyone betting on inits next deploymemt having greater meaning than ingame?
---
IIRC Bliss promised to do the big reveal on the meta show.
---
This is a great time to win at EVE.
---
Better start taking screenshots of all the poorly aged hot takes made against Brisc.
---
And not the first, second or even the third time, have lost count at this point.
---
Childchinchilla will never learn.
---
Triglavians confirm Brisc exonerated.
---
&gt;and a political official
---
He's a bottom-feeding lobbyist. The homeless guy's turd outside the Lincoln Memorial commands more respect in Washington than he does.
---
Most MMO publishers would have done exactly that, and banned anyone who disagreed with them doing it.
---
Thank Bob too, as most of the freighters are Pando's alts
---
might have been both
---
afaik the judge and killah bee were sitting next to brisc at the csm summit
---
Yup, good question, I'd like to know more
---
He's in PL. Kiiiind of a big deal^^^^^to ^^^^^himself
---
man, what a shitshow of a company
---
Can an Upwell Stargate be deployed in high-sec? Or is it just low/null (or only null?)?
---
Of course! CCP is unbelievable sometimes. Although we’ve both been playing long enough we shouldn’t be surprised anymore
---
&gt;but they should come forward with why they thought Brisc had broke the rules.
---
Having some idea of what the event was, I can say that if they did, there would be a whole lot of wut in here.
---
The guy who broke the EULA (and the law) on live stream in front of an audience of hundreds of people? *That* Gigx?
---
Could have been completely fabricated evidence turned over to them by someone with an agenda.
---
Wait, this has nothing to do about Brisc, The CSM, or bans?
---
If you mean ansiblexes, they require a sov upgrade so it's limited to sov null
---
mmmmm all 3 am back guess ccp did fuck up
---
You’re safe from travel through the rolled statics. Obviously no way to stop K162s or wandering connections. Grr frigate holes.
---
The sig for the other side does not show up. This is an important distinction, because drifters can warp to wormholes regardless of whether there is a sig. And that drifter can be combat probed...
---
The above mechanics are true for all static wormhole connections in Eve.
---
&gt;I haven't seen anything suggesting it's a no context rip
---
Alright, then tell me the context.  I know you can't because the rip that went around was a screenshot that showed barely any of the conversation.  
---
&gt;Look dude, I can't simply trust you if you tell me "nah he a good guy and not guilty"
---
You don't have to trust me.  CCP just spent two weeks looking for any excuse to not have to eat crow.  You think if they could have justified these bans they'd be backpedaling right now?
---
&gt;Also my main point is, even if he isn't guilty, I strongly oppose having him on the CSM and strongly dislike his persona because I really believe he shouldn't be on the CSM.
---
Welcome to Democracy.  Also he resigned from CSM so what's your gripe with him today?
---
As mittens pointed out last saturday, CCP have a history of saying that the CSM all agreed this or all said that where no such consensus exists.
---
I think Doom need to give this number a call: 1-800-273-8255
---
That's fair! Just the result of people reading headlines these days is worrisome right.
---
To divert attention away from the actual culprit.
---
Posting so I can see this thread after it gets shit up by people not willing to back down then gets deleted by mods.
---
We’ve notified all the media outlets that had already approached us with follow-up questions based on last week's interim statement, as well as directing those that had published articles about Brisc Rubal over the last few weeks to the new statement.
---
...one?
---
Yep.  That is eve in a nutshell.
---
yes (relatively), yes that is the general consensuses on how it works although its impossible to test , no not different anywhere else
---
no requires sov
---
&gt;Sooo, CCP got metagamed or something?
---
Could be
---
That’s fantastic to hear. Thanks for replying!
---
/u/GrathTelkin please call this number: 1-800-273-8255
---
More and more i feel embarassed for our own guys. Be it some of our FCs or whatever doom considers himself. influencer maybe?. Cringy as fuck
---
&gt;how does this even make sense? you can just undock a couple of talos and nuke shit here too???
---
Talos does 1500-2000dps, dread does 15000-20000 dps.
---
&gt;so what? you can blue scout in nullsec to achieve the same shit
---
Blue scouting is totally different thing, again
---
&gt;it's not effective nor worth it, ganking isn't as good as you think.
---
Maybe?
---
&gt;spoiler: they wont lose
---
Then nobody cares about highsec wardecs and it doesn't matter what you do. If they do care then they will hire mercs to kill the citadels.
---
&gt;also spoiler: the groups in question do have structures anyway
---
Killing random structures in highsec without any reason is waste of time.
---
Savior of Eve? He never bumped any miners.
---
Is Brisc reinstated to the CSM? It didnt say that?
---
You said his name three time in front of a mirror?
---
And this is why you don’t jump on the “fuck that guy” bandwagon.
---
Have some links to where people said he was an evil republican?
---
Iam like Thomas. I have to feel his hole.
---
They dug their own grave taking the actions in the first place. Meanwhile botting continues unabated and largely unmitigated.
---
Help a brother out - what is the timer?
---
I think you put more effort into this shitpost than all of those people combined into theirs.
---
So Brisc probably did something dodgy, but he called the lawyers in and CCP can't *prove* it, so they've been forced to row back?
---
There's some really interesting stuff in the original ban post which is not being addressed by CCP at the moment:
---
&gt; We would like to take the opportunity to thank CSM 13 for their transparency and their respect for the council as an institution, which was demonstrated by their coming together to condemn this kind of behavior and report it to CCP
---
i.e. some other CSM members grassed him up. Now, if he actually appears to not have done anything, why aren't those CSM members getting banned or at least booted off CSM? Abusing a CSM position to get another member banned for metagaming reasons is as big a betrayal of trust as what Brisc is supposed to have done initially, so the fact that nothing along those lines appears to be happening means CCP still think he did it.
---
&gt; Some additional steps to help prevent similar conduct in future will be implemented. Starting from the next summit, we will impose a rule that prohibits electronics during CSM sessions and will take extra time to educate everyone about confidentiality, insider trading and general do’s and don’ts when it comes to operating under NDA.
---
i.e. Brisc texted his mates to tell them about NDA updates so they could get on the market train early, or logged onto Eve in the meeting and bought stuff up himself.
---
Not really.
---
Can all of these people please PM me on Discord? Thanks.
---
He does know enough to ask the right questions to the right people to REPRESENT THEM.
---
I love how your precious feels are so hurt you're back here 16 days later. You sure it's not you who got fucked? You seem a little assblasted
---
a gasbag idiot who thinks he's special
---
I was more or less agreeing with you but taking it a step further as I have never trusted the shills that compose the CSM. Been playing since 2007 and seen this sort of shit time and time again. 
---
While I hold CCP fully responsible for the shit-show that is the CSM. I understand why it exists. CCP can't pay employees to police the politics of EvE without creating endless conflicting interest issues. The CSM has to exist. However, the problem is CCP is not properly policing the CSM. EvE touts itself as being a brutal real-life-esque sim in space right?
---
Well let's crack open a history book for guidance on this one. According to what I see in there; every member of the CSM should have a little piece of copper rapidly injected into the space between their frontal lobe and where the skill injector goes for acts of collusion, ineptitude and willful ignorance resulting in the unlawful exile of lawful EvE citizens as well as loss of property and legal tender. Bans ranging from Brisc right on down to the lonely pyroxbrain with 3 alts strip mining high sec belts but not responding to local. So they get banned for botting and don't get an appeal because they didn't suck some CSM members goon-dick in fleet chat at 2am when TEST or PL or who-the-fuck-ever dropped 30 avatars on their moms house 6 months ago and cried all night in discord about it until someone padded their bottom and tucked them into bed. 
---
Fuck the CSM, just like in the real world; we need us a true fucking cleansing. Shake up the ruling parties.
---
I mean, from my point of view, a screenshot of a convo with Brisc saying "but CCP cant prove it" followed by an unban by CCP does kinda look damning, or does that seem THAT irrational to you?
---
You're not speaking to a guy that argues with principles, I can make a 180 of my opinion if presented with a point of view that makes more sense. But as of right now I see no reason why I should trust your words. And the fact that members of your [alliance make threads like this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bhb5is/nocollusion_a_partial_archive_of_commentary_on/), parading around like an actual guru ressurected infront of his sectarian followers, doesn't really make it better
---
I know this is way late, and on a random comment.  I am actually curious how this will affect your RL career, as on a fresh machine ID, install of OS and a random wifi ( so no altered search results due to tailored profile) you being banned for such actions are still #1.
---
My question is: Do you think this will have any long lasting ripple effect on your RL career and any future people in such volatile positions from ever revealing their connection of their RL ID's to their gaming?
---
I am not asking thing because I am trying to be mean or anything. I am genuinely curious about this.
---
Most people can't meaningfully do that.
---
Brisc was in a unique situation due to the press release about him being removed from the CSM and the charges as to why being made public and also the real-life connection between his EVE Persona and his actual career.
---
Dont shit on my pings, but feel free to shit on my 20 man kitchen sink fleet with a revenant.
---
No problem.
---
How is your day Doom?
---
Better journalism that MSNPC!
---
Let me guess, 3rd grade?
---
Ehh I don’t really see why u/maulth comment was posted. I think it’s a perfectly reasonable stance, that wasn’t just some “bandwagon let me make a fool of myself witch-hunt” comment. The guy apparently doesn’t care for brisc, but at the same time wanting some clarification on CCP evidence.
---
Most of the others though, toxic bandwagon karma posts that are bad for the community.
---
Technically the INIT that could get shit done has been dead for a while.
---
PR nightmares have been a staple for CCP for almost two decades now. Yet they're still here so they must think they don't need a PR guy after every fuck up or prevent a fuck up. People are still going to buy Internet spaceships.
---
The way this article is written it seems like TEST is winning until you read the end and see they are shit.
---
hey init where are you? Certainly not in tribute. Did you deploy to reddit?
---
No, fucc u doom &gt;:(
---
&gt;	There is no reason to think CCP would do a mistake like this
---
Uh...
---
&gt;	This is a video game
---
No it’s not. This is IRL NDA.
---
I remember he had a legit breakdown and started spamming incoherently. Poor guy's probably going to have another one now.
---
That's racist
---
are you new to this game?
---
The reason was to be able to better focus on the newer bug reports, which are more likely to be relevant (= more likely to result in an internal defect, which can be fixed), while accepting the fact, that we currently do not have the resources (within CCP, through outsourcers and through our volunteer bug hunters) to go through the full backlog of old reports.
---
I am busy suffering under the wage slavery of capitalism but I'll writing by 7CST tonight at the latest because I gotta buy knives for my apartment.
---
I would say at least 10
---
&gt; so I've kinda been primed and ready to fire for a few days now.
---
Sounds like my Saturday nights.
---
I've heard of desperation, but damn
---
Next stop, station REEEEEEEEEEEE!
---
Boom. This one smelled of incompetence from the start, hopefully the drama isn't over yet.
---
Winter is coming.
---
in other news, doomchinchilla is still retarded.
---
You forgot to mention that Odin's Call deployed one Drake.
---
Winter is here.
---
I'm at a loss. This is peak idiocy.
---
Oh, and if you go to  [https://www.ccpgames.com/careers](https://www.ccpgames.com/careers), then you will find that we are also hiring QA.
---
😂
---
&gt;wts NEW TRIG SHIP 2 MILLION ACT FAST
---
[Multiple Items]
---
Only becasue the GSM unbanned him it dont mean he didnt leak anything.
---
I really believed them on this one. Like, there's no possible way they would accuse &lt;BRISC RUBAL'S REAL IDENTITY&gt; of an actual NDA breach with zero evidence and unsubstantiated assumptions, right? Yet here we are....
---
That's pretty damn funny and interesting. I guess it is one of things that people just wrongly assume, just because you work on and develop a game/software, does not necessarily mean that you know every single detail about like the back of your hand. 
---
Sort of like how many if not most programmers extensively go back to their learning material and use a crazy amount of Search Engine Fu to get details they have forgotten over time, such as basic syntax and various libraries in whatever language they are coding in.
---
Honestly, that looks like a manic episode if I have ever seen one.
---
Please go get help Doom.
---
Last time I killed these guys: https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98583113/ it was 9 minutes. But they change it and it varies from system to system. Go to their pos/citadel and log off - log in until you find it out. Check these systems:  http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Wicked_Creek/4F89-U/YHEN-G/G063-U#npc. This is where I caught him the most but I stopped hunting him a month ago so I don't know what's up nowadays. He usually logs at around midnight eve time and bots till downtime. Good luck friend o7
---
Just imagine how humiliating this must be for CCP.
---
You could say someone at CCP
---
*sunglasses* 
---
Took too much initiative.
---
I am hoping that the full exoneration makes it out into all of the media outlets the original story hit, and that folks who saw the original story will see the follow up. I'm happy that CCP was as public about walking this back as they were, and I'm glad to see that PC Gamer and Massively have already written articles. 
---
I fully expect that this will end up in negative campaign ads against me in the future if/when I run for office in real life again. It has also had other impacts that I can't get into, but overall I'm hoping that the statements made clear all of that up.
---
You actually don't know anything about what he knows it would seem.  I don't even know what Brisc knows but I do know that he's a pretty cool dude and had a good heart for the game and wanted to make it better alongside the rest of the CSM.  On a Goon dominant CSM alot of changes for the betterment of the game as a whole happened.  Maybe you should think on that a bit my dude.
---
I was agreeing with you. I don't think anyone was acting on malice.
---
Turns out they had nothing the whole time.  That's one meeting I wouldn't have minded sitting in on.
---
Wrong. We've actually had record-setting years for the past two years and are in some of the best health we've ever been in.
---
He did say it was a mistake tho! I was totally right.
---
This is what I'm talking about - stupid shit that isn't true. I NEVER ran as a wormhole candidate.  I offered, after I got elected and there was no wormhole candidate on the CSM, to represent WH issues so they had somebody to present their ideas and concerns. I never campaign as a WHer, never ran as a WHer, never said I was a WHer. All of that shit was jokes that came out later. 
---
I have not lied, and I don't know why you're accusing me of that. And obviously I didn't deserve to get banned, or else I would still be banned. Did you not read the statement CCP made? 
---
Come on, man. You've got a lot of prejudices that are based on bullshit. Let them go.
---
[Here. I fixed this it for you.](https://imgur.com/qkJ7KYl)
---
I remember reading through that thread and being really disappointed by the cognitive dissidence, general ignorance and high levels of dick comments directed towards Brisc in a personal manner.
---
I saw it very simply. CCP said Brisc was a bad boy. That's it. With that amount of crap information (zero) I was on Briscs side by default. Pointing a finger at someone, making an accusation and then removing them from a community while they are in a major position needs to have a clear explanation along with it if people with half a brain are to accept it.
---
A lot of people dislike Brisc simply due to his IRL job. Which I think is a true shame that many of our compatriots here simply discarded Brisc since they think hes a shit bag lobbyist and were just fine with his ban despite no proof and at the same time questioned his character for defending himself.
---
People need to fucking relax. Jesus Christ.
---
Why? He is still an asshole. Not an NDA breaking asshole but still an asshole.
---
Welcome back idiot, undock so I can wreck your dreams.
---
have a nice day
---
That is a decent point, the mod would have to be High Sec only which wouldn't make sense.
---
I am just happy to have this behind me, and I don't really want to dwell on it. CCP said in their statement that they're looking into ensuring that this doesn't happen again and I take them at their word when they say that.
---
You might say it's a monster :P
---
Fair.. I think the mod would have to be High Sec only which wouldn't make sense at all.
---
Amazing
---
Wow, big yikes dude.
---
I mean, they came from Serenity, sooo...
---
If I give you Plat will you make a post with positive comments?
---
TBH same. This came organically from listening the podcast and thinking of people that Space-Truck for an Eve Career... granted this may remove some of the risk and fun for those people.
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
Kinda miss overdose, he was leading the pack into the triple digits for me.
---
Lizards don't have balls, holy or otherwise.
---
 "banned and then unbanned because CCP fucked up"   
---
That needs to become a flair option.
---
Oh I mean I left actual eons ago (before Discord was even a thing) so I can't really comment on Test culture but it sounds like something they'd do.
---
Well the XYZ drift concept was just that you may get lucky and drift for 2 seconds and be able to align and GTFO, on the other hand you could get fucked and drift long enough that the gankers bumpers are able to just get back on you... Ideally you wouldn't be able to reactivate the mod for 24 hours so /rekt
---
of all of the things that aged well from this situation, this has to be near the top
---
I honestly can't with some of you.
---
PC Gamer Master Update Race.
---
When the CSM "elections" are just essentially metagaming ops for the biggest alliances, this is the type of shit that will continue to happen.
---
I hope ccp takes the opportunity to consider how to unfuck the CSM, or they might as well just get rid of it entirely and replace it with survey monkey.
---
The vast majority of people in this sub are retarded.  He's just extremely toxic on top of being retarded.
---
&gt;magaimg
---
Yikes lmao
---
I'll have no hand in this!
---
Can't imagine Jin would try to metagame someone off CSM. Only one that really makes sense would probably be Vince or Sort. Doesn't sound much like Vince either though.
---
&gt;more goons is good for the game

Literally *any other interaction* with a Goon would have been disappointing.

This is the result of Goons trying to widot INIT by framing Brisc, isnt it? INIT should break off from the Imperium IMO
---
&gt;Did you not read the statement CCP made?
---
Even if I were to find out, and then admit, that maybe some of my prejudices are based on bullshit; I know you think I'm an entrenched asshole that blindly hates you but that's not the case, you can read the comment chain I had with Rakajj. I wouldn't be writing these fucking walls of texts back to you if I wouldn't want to listen what you have to say in response. But it's phrases like that one that immediately make me distrust you again. This isn't the GOP, you're not in the senate, yeah obviously I read CCPs statement but you insult my critical thinking by telling me I'm wrong for not believing the exact words CCP wrote. We both agree that CCP couldn't really post "Yeah, we can't prove it but we actually know he did it, whatever" even if they wanted to.
---
I'm sure CCP is itching to renege on its decision to ban the guy for posting kiddie porn in local.
---
Wow /u/doomchinchilla being a massive fucking idiot, you don't say.

For me it was never whenever you did it or not. The way CCP handled the situation was just dogshit wrapped in catshit. I'm glad you resigned from the CSM; CCP is not worth your time and effort.

Keep fighting the good fight Mal.

*Holy cloaca!

You are really not living up to the promise of your name

Lol that plot twist

"Charity work" might be overselling it a bit. It was a hobby that he participated in for his own satisfaction. There's nothing wrong with that! I just wouldn't think of it as selfless charity.

You cannot smart bomb in high sec. So this is not a valid method to trigger CONCORD.

Overdose and I were in PH together way back when it first got going so I was a bit inoculated and didn't hate his posting as much as most did.
---
What's he doing now?
---
I believe the players in m00 who were part of the siege were told to stop what they were doing by the GMs, and basically responded by telling the GMs to fuck off and then kept at it. Which also lead to them being banned.
---
Who uses Faction ammo in missions?

And between MWD and MJD you arent losing any time. A blaster Kronos will clear missions faster than a rail.

And its way more fun.

GSM PRESSURED CCP, OBVIOUS CORRUPTION, STILL GUILTY.
---
I said from the beginning this was a mistake, and I never broke the NDA, and I never gave inside information to my alliance mates.  I've been consistent in saying that stuff never happened for the last two weeks, although I have kept my head down because folks like you would immediately call me a liar. 
---
Now, CCP has admitted that I didn't breach their confidentiality, violate the NDA, and neither of the guys accused used insider information to make isk. 
---
I said I didn't do it. They say I didn't do it. What more do you want?
---
I, for one, could really go for a nice revenge war this time of year.
---
Im pretty sure i shittalked him too, I DESERVE A MENTION
---
Where'd all the armchair lawyers go?
---
Maximum tinfoil time: this whole episode was staged so that CCP could get into international news headlines and boost subs. CCP gets press, Brisc gets exhonorated and can point to that for future clients saying "see I am discreet". CCP only loses a little bit of face with their players but make mad $$$. BRISC RUBAL IS A CRISIS ACTOR!!!
---
Then CCP uses that new subscription money at the will of their true master, Jin'taan. You see Jin'taan is actually pulling CCP's strings and using money made from Eve Online to fund his scientific experiments in conjunction with Elon Musk to make Catgirl maids like the sick degenerates they are. With an army of Catgirl maids behind them, Jin'taan will cause the weebs to rise up thus putting an end to the long forgotten Team 10/20 conflict. It was the long game all along.

Any shield tanked pvp for a legion?  I'm in the process of working on shield tanked Amarr ships and trying to figure out all the ones that would at least be somewhat useable.  Not sure about the Legion though.

And if anyone wants to throw suggestions in the ring on fits, or ships that are shield tankable for pvp, feel free.

Ok. I guess i'll just ignore an entire industry evaporating at the speed of you-tube and take your word for it. Ask the news papers who have to put paywalls up after you read the first paragraph how much money they are still able to squeeze out of the 50+.

Your website is already so trashed with ads that anyone going there has to be using u-block origin to kill your insidious JS tracking or at the very least AdBlock+ to attempt to curb the horse shit like auto playing videos you cant pause that scroll with the screen.

Lets go take a drive over over to the guys at Univision and ask their IFA team what caused them to give up gizmodo and the onion... Long story short. Series C and Series D funding with an Angel on top does not a healthy quarter make.

&gt;You folks need to come to terms with that in most ban cases CCP actually cannot have substantial evidence that could hold in court.
---
Wait, was this an actual thing people claimed?
---
Okay, Alex Jones.
---
this is now done via dotlan link, maybe i'll integrate the corp history in upcoming improvements
---
Like you say, this isnt a court of law, and we are not an jury of his peers. If CCP says he did it, for all intents and purposes, he did. The opposite is also true. If, like me, you were wrong, just say so. I'm pleased to have been wrong.

He can’t resign, I voted for him!
---
COPE
---
Lawyers put pressure, CCP spinned the ban around. Its ok to be trash indie company but coward also is not acceptable.
---
You’re basically saying, despite that ccp reversed everything he’s still guilty?
---
Easy for you, isn’t it? What a way of wiggling yourself out of saying what is right: “I was wrong, sorry.”
---
I still don’t know what happened or why you got fragged.
---
However, I did vote for you, I’m also bummed out.
---
CCP should throw you a bone for fucking this up.
---
Anyway: don’t leave EVE. We still love you!
---
TLDR.
---
He was sentenced and received his verdict. That's why people crucified him. Granted, he won the appeal but people were right to assume that CCP had done their job when laying down the harshest of penalties that they can. Obviously the only thing to really learn from this, is that CCP are utterly fucking clueless and they cannot be trusted to hammer a nail in a shit without destroying both.

The pilots sit clutching tendies, graciously hoping to cash in later more of their hard earned good boy points, as the days roll on. Its ground hogs day at CCP Games. If u/CCP_Falcon awakens to see his shadow, it will surely be one more day of the Brisc Rubal investigation. If no shadow is seen, then the investigation is done. 
---
"A flurry of prior decisions rest on this decision!" Still, the days continue to roll on. "A release on Friday means an attempt to bury the report," they tell themselves, white shirt stained with honey mustard and other substances that bare no resemblance to ejaculate, "a release today means CCP Games did nothing wrong!"

Meanwhile, Omeca Gold has received six thousand pounds of popcorn kernels in Delve, but his reliance on r/Eve to supply him with nutrient laden nut butter in an effort to remain relevant has failed to deliver. If the Brisc Rubal report is not out soon, he will have to rely on depleted uranium to obtain sustenance.

that's why you were banned in the first place, and you would stay banned if you didn't have a platform

Amen. The CSM looks like a farce at this point.
---
&gt;There was probably insider trading. There was the amount of evidence for CCP to typically act on it. It's just the evidence wasn't the kind of evidence that'd win a possible legal case.
---
Nah.  Were that the case they could just walk back the NDA bit and ban for whatever reason, as they are free to do anyway (especially re: the people who weren't Brisc).

Would have been better to just apoligize and move on.

I'm saying that there are multiple explanations of the limited information we all have, and among them, the explanation that he is as guilty as any other banned person is stronger due to arguments above.

So you can't claim beyond doubt innocance. I can't claim beyond doubt guilt. All we can do is interpreting partial evidence and datapoints.

edit: Hell, I would even go so far as to say PR looked over the blog post, and lawyers were contacted before announcing the ban, and even go so far as to say lawyers looked over the blog post as well. The fact that they won't go into detail is just good security. If they released any sort of details, other parties could theoretically reverse engineer how they collected that information, and avoid getting caught in the future.

Depends where you're flying from I guess. I just looked up a trip from Vancouver for a random week in May and including midrange hotel and tax it's under $1,200 Canadian dollars, or $900 USD.  In fact this is so reasonable I might go.
---
&gt; Nah. Were that the case they could just walk back the NDA bit and ban for whatever reason, as they are free to do anyway (especially re: the people who weren't Brisc).
---
Unless the person can actually sue for IRL damages and they have no beyond doubt evidence for contract violation.
---
&gt; There is no legal case re: "I got banned".
---
&gt; There is a legal case re: "You violated a contract."
---
&gt; GigX didn't sign a contract.
---
Do you realize this actually supports my thesis? In court, CCP would have to establish contract violation, from the amount of partial evidence they have similar to the Gigx case, which is probably impossible.

Seeing as you have no evidence to show his guilt, the only thing you are operating on is your bias and opinion. Tell us how you really feel.

That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Let's get crazy. A happy cloud. We don't have anything but happy trees here.

I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.
---
Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. It's important to me that you're happy. It is a lot of fun. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Poor old tree.
---
Son of a gun. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. There we are.

Nothing wrong with washing your brush. That's crazy. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death.

Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Let's have a happy little tree in here.

I can easily blame you for the same so your point is moot.

This whole affair stinks.
---
Maybe CCP found some insider trading, didn't know who it was, and picked Brisc.  Maybe it was metagaming by other CSM members.  Maybe Brisc did it but they can't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt (or whatever standard they use).  Maybe Brisc pled guilty and made a backroom deal.  Maybe all of this is CCP tapping the fishbowl.
---
The simple fact is that CCP hasn't told us anything verifiable beyond "banned" or "not banned".  We don't know who (if anyone!) on the CSM told CCP.  We don't know what they said.  We don't know what data CCP reviewed, what they found or did not find.  Despite their claims of transparency, they have given us nothing.
---
Yes, we can fill in the blanks, but we're as likely to get "Heroes" as "Horrors" that way.  Not to mention the inevitable controversy, politics, and poo-throwing following any such attempts.
---
I'm leaning towards "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark," but only because I still have a kernel of faith left in CCP.  I'll be the first to admit: I don't know.
---
To "ride this shit right to bedrock" I would have had to be interested in the whole Brisc got banned narrative. I'm not. I just happen to find unspeakable greed to be disgusting.

How complex is a bot? I have limited experience of them and no real idea how they work but i am under the impression they operate in a more simplistic nature, ie they warp in, drop drones and warp out when anything not blue comes into local?  
---
Or can they actually be very complex, for example could they run burner missions if the target changed every mission?
---
&gt; This reddit seems to have done a hard 180.
---
However, some reserved judgment, and didn't jump onto the bandwagon.
---
Shut the fuck up you absolute pisswanker.
---
What the fuck?
---
&gt;Unless the person can actually sue for IRL damages and they have no beyond doubt evidence for contract violation.
---
What?  No.  CCP can ban for whatever reason or lack thereof they want.
---
I mean, feel free to explain why, if your theory was correct, they unbanned the other folks involved?  There's no legal issue for them.
---
Again, the issue is the NDA, not the bans:
---
&gt;You folks need to come to terms with that in most ban cases CCP actually cannot have substantial evidence that could hold in court. And they don't need to, as the accounts are their property. **It's just this time they happened to ban a person who entangled his IRL personality with the game so much that he can push IRL damages in a court case with CCP**.
---
THIS SHIT DOESN'T MATTER.  The only thing that mattered legally was claiming he breached contract.  Them banning him doesn't cause damages.  Publicly claiming he was in breach of a contract very well might.
---

You either have your flair based shittalk or mine well-argued but longer pieces on this subreddit.
---
And most shittalkers like yourself never actually engage with the arguments. Doesn't bother me.
---
You possess no evidence to show guilt. You have no first hand or second hand statements that have any veracity. What you have is an opinion based on a firestorm in a community after someone threw some shit in the air. You agree with the portions you want, baseless as they may be and unable to substantiate them- and you want your opinion to be taken seriously. No one types out that big a word blob without thinking themselves "clever" or "insightful" or at the very least "informed". This is why the community laughs at you when you post. You actually think you are always right, always informed, always the guy that sweeps in to enlighten the masses. You need to step back and have a few beers. I bet you would be a fun dude, because you aren't an idiot, if you stepped back and looked at things from both sides and THEN bloviated.

We're talking about the same organisation that produced Incarna project and were honestly surprised when their customers weren't happy.
---
You forgot to consider something else: Brisc Rubal did say something, but it technically wasn't a violation of the NDA so therefore we're at the situation we're at.  That'll explain why they took so long to look into it again, because they needed to see if what he did actually violated the NDA.
---
I’m a bad! Thought they were disabled like interdiction bubbles in empire space.

No, we want plenty of them to stay banned, but they obviously need a better internal process for evaluating these claims and issues.

Wow, it must be truly difficult to go through life with that level of stupidity.

You stayed admirably neutral on this one capqu, a lot of people on your side were downright gleeful about this. I respect your neutrality.

*points at the door in disappointment* "get the fuck out"
---
First - thank you CCP for being willing to investigate and review findings of a ban and when the banning was found to be incorrect, to issue a statement and take action to publicly reverse those incorrect actions.   My hope is, while this review was for very high ranking alliance members and in Brisc's case, a public figure, this would also happen for even the lowly no-body Eve player.
---
Second - I'm hoping that internal CCP procedures are modified in the future, CCP won't let outside influences, assumptions to metagame them going forward.  
---
Third - the lousy publications that saw this as an opportunity to make a political statement and brought the real world into Eve Online, levying their political wrath on a political party and slinging mud have issued retractions.  
---
Just more fake news, nothing to see here.... move along.

You just move the goal posts and constantly claimed the other person is ignoring your unsubstantiated points. 
---
&gt; No other CSM was implicated for misguiding CCP.  
---
Irrelevant.  
---
&gt; No info was revealed about what made CCP think there was insider trading.  
---
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absense, nor is it the inverse.  
---
&gt; The "that makes sense" incident on twitch.  
---
???  
---
&gt; How CCPs language was so sure, and they actually acted on a ban. People now say CCP was stupid, but maybe they just issued a ban with evidence they typically have, but came across a unique situation later.
---
Sure, this could be the case. Do you have evidence for it? Otherwise it's not a well thought out argument. It's just conjecture.  
---
&gt; It took quite some time for them to backpedal (it possibly took a legal analysis of the case).  
---
It took around a week or two to basically admit they fucked up (with the first post). That's... not a lot of time. Not really sure where you're going with this.  
---
There. You've been engaged.
---
No evidence of that, yet.
---
Whilst CCP may feel that whoever raised it shouldn't be lynched (rightly) and that releasing their name to the public would lead to that (probably), if they are re-standing for election, we need to know to take it in to account.
---
So I would say either CCP should encourage the CSM members involved to open up themselves or bar them from running for CSM again.
---
As a resident of Detroit I can confirm that Tama is in fact safer
---
Two words.  Stooge Dragon
---
Indeed. Brian's CSM campaign was run on a "I'm a real life politician, I can do this better than others can". His career is germane to being in the CSM.
---
CCP publicly stating that he broke an NDA transcends the CSM and, if it were true, would've reflected badly on his real life competency and trustworthiness. 
---
I can absolutely believe that he has been defamed as a result of this, and think he would have a good case for suing them even after this outcome.  The bell can't be unrung.
---
&gt; It's like CCP loaded up a shuttle with all their credibility and undocked from Jita.

as someone who injected everything i wanted, i think its time to remove them from the game
---
&gt; What? No. CCP can ban for whatever reason or lack thereof they want.
---
It's not an issue of whether they can, but an issue of whether they want do. They won't want to if a ban is gonna legally bite them back for IRL damages.
---
&gt; if your theory was correct, they unbanned the other folks involved? There's no legal issue for them.
---
CCP wouldn't want to publicly reveal that people could avoid getting banned by threatening them by court battles either.
---
&gt; The only thing that mattered legally was claiming he breached contract. Them banning him doesn't cause damages. Publicly claiming he was in breach of a contract very well might.
---
You are wrong. Banning someone could potentially cause IRL damages. If Gigx was an IRL politician, his ban for an irl threat could cause him reputation damage. Imagine there was no substantial evidence (like a recording) of the threat but some kind of reasonable evidence (imagine the Judge received a threat letter from Serbia signed Gigx) to deduce that there was a threat  (similar to insider trading case). CCP would backpedal or not even act on it the evidence wouldn't hold in court, if Gigx can convincingly threaten them by suing.
---
Thank god someone recognized me. How did I not get on OP.
---
I didn't say that. They care about the perceived integrity of the press, hence the guidelines.
---
It's very clear, it says 'we couldn't prove anything so we were forced to write down these lawyerly words'.

i bet brisc busted a fat nut over this thread

Guilty until proven innocent is the new norm. in our western societies, unfortunately.

Goon failed BIG TIMES

Dont bother, incursions as alpha are where the isk is at.

Still worse. T20 acted alone, this was an official statement and position on behalf of the entire company.

thats sounds like a delve war.

Totally right ;/

If ccp got meta gamed they should probably ban the people who did it no ?

I agree. And you possess no evidence to show innocence.
---
It's the entire point of this post.
---
can be!
---
As stagnant as things are I suggest Gigx pardon and 10 trillion isk startup money.
---
So, you are guilty of violating the EULA? I have no evidence to prove you are innocenct. So I should then posit that you could be guilty? What about being guilty of necrophilia? Again, I have nothing to prove you are guilty.. but I also have nothing to prove you are innocent.
---
If you read the entirety of my post and what I was replying to, that I am not saying it was or wasn't Sort. I was stating that that theory is out there and it's all speculation and CCP should give more information than just an apology.

Yeah how dare he attempt to be the Epic Wormhole CSM and be a squawking idiot across several channels, get angry when people point out that they don’t care for that, and then shit on them publicly

Good that i have corp flair.

Don’t... go... too.... close... to the poo!

thats what you get for lying to your meber about pvp being "fun". They expect fun, see the bash / tidi / blue balls shit thats 99% of eve warfare and quit
---
&gt;Because nobody would roll an alt to collect their own bounties, right?
---
Yea, especially 100+ alts operating  simultaneously and doing it 7 days a week in same exact space either in shifts or 23.5/7 ....

If wormholers could actually vote as energetically as they downvote people who at least attempt to help them, then they'd have a *real* wormhole CSM.

Oh trust me, I considered doing it a while back ever since the Praxis was released because I was intrigued by the scanning bonus. Still, my need for absolute safety (being a complete carebear myself) over ISK trumped everything else.

You see, this is why in the real world, people who are 'important enough' are put on leave with/without pay while an investigation is done.

Yeah but CCP's response to T20 was fucking catastrobad

Yes but ffs it’s a game. Do you seriously think he’d have followed through when he realised just how much it costs? It’s not like they’d kidnapped his kids. It’s just a game.

&gt; Absence of evidence is not evidence of absense, nor is it the inverse.
---
Something did prompt CCP to think there was insider trading. There is no absence of that factor. Don't post word salad.
---
&gt; Do you have evidence for it? Otherwise it's not a well thought out argument. It's just conjecture.
---
All anyone has is conjecture. That's the very claim of this post. That people can't claim innocence even if CCP makes such as statement, as they might as well be doing it to be legally protected.

They can be as complex as the person writing them feels like making them, within the parameters of what's available to them (and I think you can get access to the controls in the UI? so bots can see overview, local etc).

It's ridiculous how little CCP does about even the most blatant of organised botting.

And for those wondering why we aren't happy to see a bunch of new 'players' coming from Serenity ... well this is why.

That's what I replied to. Remember when I said you move goal posts? Are you trying to prove the point?

Don't get upset that people don't want to type fuck all walls of text about conjecture then. This could very well be the case. There's just nothing to show that it is. You could insert one of a million theories into the void of information and make it roughly work within an outline. It just doesn't matter without something more concrete.
---
pets for life thats why

&gt;you cant smartbomb in highsec? nice to know
---
What are safety settings ?
---
&gt; Brisc Rubal did say something
---
What did he say?
---
If he said something that would prompt insider trading, but if it's not technically an NDA breach, it's still fishy af. It just means he circumvented the NDA to do things the NDA is designed to prevent.

&gt;Banning someone could potentially cause IRL damages. If Gigx was an IRL politician, his ban for an irl threat could cause him reputation damage.
---
But as an public figure, it would be difficult if not impossible for him to sue for damages. This is fact. Public figures do not enjoy the same legal rights in this area for very good reasons.
---
That would require a 2nd person but I dont have any friends hahah... :(
---
Holy fuck you are retarded, Ian.
---
We didn't get any details, so how should I know.  CCP did say they were innocent of insider trading, so it's possibly something that wasn't under the NDA but not officially in public.
---
Oof
---
All loot to PERUNGA.
---
I do it a lot, its a lot of fun and really helps when solo - its pretty much the only way I roam null out of a null static
---
you want your alt to be in something useful that can either start fights for you (ceptor tackle) or provide you with a proper boost in fights without needing much management (triple link bifrost)
---
ceptor + dual link 50mn 1-rep drekavac is a great combo
---
bifrost + phantasm can be nuts too, phantasm becomes so hard to kill when it has double skirmish + 1x shield link, and you can carry extra cap boosters in your cmd dessy (since phantasm chews through them)
---
if you're just getting started, make sure your alt is in something cheapish so you don't mind losing it too much (t2-fitted ceptor? or even a t1 tackle frig if you're not too loaded isk-wise)
---
its ok to leave a ceptor alt in auto-orbit while you fly your main or simply leave it double-clicked in space in one direction once the fight starts, always focus on your main when needed.

That is just awesome.

Brisc’s legacy is now sealed in the annals of New Eden.

What ever happened to innocent till proven guilty? I havent played in about oh 5 years or so, someone wanna tell me the tale of what happened here? Also I imagine it's rather hard to get a permanent ban in EvE, so I'm completely lost here.

Isn't he kind of one of three people to actually being in the position of taking the apology (or not, if he had chosen so)?

Don't tell him how he has to take it.

oracle is often shield tanked, so are t2 variants of the arbitrator
---
&gt; I have no evidence to prove you are innocenct.
---
You are ambiguously using 2 different meanings of "evidence". One meaning is "unfalsifiable evidence". The other is "partial evidence".
---
You initially argued that we don't have unfalsifiable evidence that he is guilty. 
---
My post argues that we have partial evidence that Brisc is guilty. But agrees with you that we don't have unfalsifiable evidence for his innocence or guilt.
---
Meanwhile, if you have partial evidence of me violating EULA feel free to elaborate.
---
The circus that is CCP 2019. Just wow.
---
T20's IRL job wasn't on the line though. He got "disciplined" internally and that was that. Accusing &lt;BRISC'S REAL NAME &amp; OCCUPATION&gt; of an NDA breach has very real life consequences, ones that you figure a company would know, and would therefore do their homework before taking actions based on unsubstantiated assumptions.
---
are you saying chinese will do what goons are doing for years now

this is oddly specific

It already has, Commander Aze said he would not continue his streak of failures to be elected, specifically because of this incident.

Lol nah, not "people" just olmekeka. He seems to have consumed only the few parts of this story that his greasy brain can connect to feed his vulnerable ego.
---
Have to agree on CCP's ability to keep fucking up.
---
CCP said the CSM raised this to them.
---
If it was then the discussions they had with them regarding that meeting should be released with the other CSM minutes so we can know what happened, who was making the claim and when.
---
He's a never ending fountain of the bitterest salty tears. It's delightful.

" Following on from [our statement on April 17](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pq436e/interim-statement-on-brisc-rubal-follow-up-investigation), we have completed our review of the Brisc Rubal investigation and determined that our initial findings were incorrect. Neither Brisc Rubal nor the other players implicated in this incident breached CCP’s confidentiality, " Someone is going to be packing/already packed up their cubical
---
&gt;This is the result of Goons trying to widot INIT by framing Brisc, isnt it? 
---
And your evidence for this, apart from your really wishing it was true, is....?
---
Probably more like "these guys who have a vendetta with you in game pointed out something that you did, may or may not have lined up... roughly... ish... and because they are totally neutral, not long term antagonists in game... we are going to immediately accept it at face value without looking into it."
---
Stunt is a person who got banned by CCP for information from another player in a 3rd party application. For the record Falcon has stated that CCP do not use 3rd party software/information for peoples bans, which of course is a blatant lie in the first place. CCP guy fucked up and Stunt paid the price for a joke (everyone knew it was a joke but the CCP guy wanted to save face anyway)
---
No
---
&gt;So Brisc probably did something dodgy
---
If it becomes public, you're going to laugh at the sheer triviality of what happened.
---
Hmm... CCPLZ... Got the power to not shitfit a marshall... lets go and shitfit a marshall
---
I agree it's just a game.
---
He claims he did have a substantial effect on his real life though. Could be true. People did more serious things for this game than suing CCP.
---
would you like to know their location?
---
I still like the idea of region chat instead of local.  A nice compromise between the "Remove Local" crowd and the "Keep Local" crowd.
---
Cute dog though.
---
They also mentioned having "proof"
---
One person (two? more?) made a claim that would have been a bad thing if true, but was unsubstantiated. CCP responded like a jackhammer publicly, without researching it. Reddit went up in flames with a lot of people sperging with their bias and emotions, one way or the other, with no regard to facts or reason or outcome. It was pretty stupid.
---
No evidence, just speculation. I assumed that since the CSM consist mostly of goons, it was most likely a goon that reported Brisc to CCP
---
Yea, lets use those brains an apply logic as to why we dont hit russian timed sov and sov 25 jumps away

I’m glad someone understood the reference!
---
To add to what others have said, don't go beyond sabre/bifrost/ceptor + main unless you're in an F1 fleet or doing caps. Too many people fall into the trap of `Well I have a character that can fly logi... and I have a character that can fly a loki... and I have a character that can fly...`, you're just going to end up flying all your characters like shit.
---
Oof, yeah I deserve the call out. As I said in my edit before this post, I am really sorry for saying what I did. In today's world, it's become almost commonplace for people in positions of power to give in to the temptation of using that power for their own personal gain. It's definitely a hot point for me, but that's no excuse to pass judgment on someone based only on an accusation without adequate proof.
---
I also acknowledge that my apology does nothing to repair the damage done by the witchhunt/mob fest that ensued afterwards. I would completely understand if Brisc decided to say, "Fuck all the naysayers and haters, I'll enjoy watching you all eat crow for the remainder of my time in EVE."  He hasn't ever seemed like that kind of person, and that's just another reason why I should have exercised a little restraint.
---
Anyways, I am really sorry for jumping in the bandwagon Brisc and I hope you don't think it's only because I've been dragged into the spotlight like a snake. If we ever hang, I owe you a fist of some nice scotch.
---
I'm not going to apologize for believing CCP when i had no reason not to, however i can admit that i was wrong and you obviously don't deserve the ban nor the reddit drama the past weeks. And imo thats a pretty serious mistake by CCP which probably will be forgotten in a few weeks.. 
---
Feel bad for it inflicting your RL life and your family though, that much i can say. Its a game after all, we're just here to have fun

---
&gt;investigating fully
---
based on the last two posted statements it sounds like there was zero investigation at all, someone got told something, didn't verify or investigate, threw the ban hammer around the office and started their blog post. You have to wonder if they will still have a job come Monday morning at this point.

---

Real talk: OP is smart enough to have some cogent thoughts, more often than not. There is a disconnect between intelligence and believing opinions are facts, however. He also has no real knack for social mores. He combines his desire to appeal to people with his need to be right/prove he is smarter than everyone else in the room and more often than not comes over as condescending blow hard. I have had friends like that, I say had- because you don't normally continue to maintain that relationship. Which brings us to why he is on reddit in such a strong way. Probably just a bit of a loner that could use a good friend to get away from the computer some.
---
lmfao nj addressing the point there champ any more protips for us
---
Good. The cases are pretty analogous. 
---
Given the amount of effort Russians spent support Trump, it is pretty safe to assume there was collusion. But naturally, Russia wouldn't leave conclusive evidence behind, and investigators won't reach it. So house/senate can't impeach/indict the guy, like CCP can't ban Brisc. Doesn't mean they are innocent.
---
And in both cases we have republican/imperium social media warriors shitting on reasonable theories because they don't confirm their preexisting beliefs.
---
Drake Navy and Cruise Raven are hidden gems that most people don't take seriously.
---
If it was him, why wouldn’t they say so. Launching a coup is at least as bad as insider trading
---
Well........ is he really? :thonking:
---
I mean my money would be along the lines of this: 
---
Brisc told his 2 corp mates that something that all 3 worked was not gonna happen, because &lt;insert csm member&gt; objected to the idea. 
---
Then 1 of them went to CSM member X and explained him why his objection was stupid CSM member X complained to CCP, CCP banned brisc for breaking NDA. 
---
Then the backlash happened and CCP unbanned him because of the backlash.
---
He could afford it, if he ate beans for a bit.
---
Does he backpedal though?
---
It’s sounds more like of a reflection of just how shallow his life is if that is the case.
---
Don’t sue them, but sure make a big enough deal in the forums for them to take note
---
And they’re not idiots, I’m sure this will make them reconsider their banning process
---
Personally I love my Drake
---
Really ? Why don’t they take it seriously ? 
---
Thanks for your answer too :)
---
Eve 2019. People really apologizing on reddit for comments on reddit. What a time to be alive.
---
&gt; if they are re-standing for election
---
Or CCP can just tell them quietly to not run. They can and do remove candidates from running, even currently.
---
Well I guess when you look at how the last CSM who tried to represent W-space got treated, it's going to make you pause for thought.

99% of CSM members get to that position through lying and cheating, and then when they say someone did something, suddenly everyone believes them like the word of god.
---
Do you even think about what you say?
---
It really shows how little they think of the csm. If CCP truly thought of the csm as important and representatives of the community then they would have taken the time to actually talk to Brisc and to the rest of the csm about this.
---

Not really... Ads being so prevalent has a direct correlation to how much income they aren't getting from paying subscribers there to support a quality product or service. Ad space to content space ratio slips into Deth Knell territory and its curtains for that publisher. This is most places now. Why read it when someone can tell it to me in real time with demos I can see and opinions I can validate by having their perspective at the time they are experiencing it. 
---
There just really isn't much room for type/print journalism in the future. However trading on reputations will and is becoming far more prevalent. As it should.
---
Ummm, where do you get the notion that anyone needs to provide proof of their innocence ?
---
&gt; It's just this time they happened to ban a person who entangled his IRL personality with the game so much that he can push IRL damages in a court case with CCP. 
---
I'm sorry but that is not how ANYTHING works. Mitigation is 9/10ths of tort law and if you fall in a manure pit and start cutting yourself to make sure you get sick, that's not gonna fly.
---
If he's actually doing this he's probably leaving the CSM because he's going to have a warrant in Iceland for extortion and misrepresentation of the bar.
---
BAERS BAERS BAERS
---
&gt; At least CCP admitted it. The easy way out would have been to double down.
---
Not easy once the lawyers are involved. Brisc almost had to sue given how damaging that particular accusation was given his line of work. His own statement basically lays out the legal case for defamation and ends with "I will... seek all avenues for recourse available". I'm sure a more formal lawyers letter saying much the same thing also arrived at CCP's offices... There's no way CCP's lawyers would let them just double down if they didn't have solid proof backing it up.
---
when the witch hunt runs out of witches, it becomes the town watch
---
Aye
---
&gt; that suggests that if you later find something to be incorrect, even if you acted in good faith, to publish a correction.
---
Granted I don’t know much about U.K. law, but if it’s anything similar to US slander or libel laws, it’s the original claimant (CCP in this case) that is responsible to correct the previously false claim (that brisc broke NDA). 
---
The media outlets aren’t the ones making the claim. They reported that CCP made a claim, and took an action (the ban). The reports are still technically true. CCP May have been wrong to do so, but the fact they did do Those things is still true. It’s kind of like when someone gets accused of a crime, even if the court later determines innocence, reporting the accusation itself is not the same as accusing the person directly.
---
Now if U.K. law takes a further step of responsibility to those reporting on someone else’s claims or actions, then that might make the media outlets responsible.
---

EVE is kinda weird when it comes to dual boxing. It's slow enough that you can dual box any activity short of flying logi in the AT. But the amount of situational awareness you need for each character is so high that you're bound to screw up even single boxing.    
---
EVE is a great game for mechanically slower players (ie. older players) that want to leverage their strategic thinking and decision making to compensate for a lack of twitch gameplay ability. ^*(At least that's what I tell myself when I'm stuck in ELO hell for every FPS and MOBA I play.)*
---
How can they have acted properly and brisk be innocent at the same time?
---
Life in a nutshell.  If you sue to get your job back, you're not going to want to work in the environment that results.

Okay, so further investigation provides no evidence of wrongdoing by Brisc or the other two folk.
---
What about the CSM member(s) who reported this to CCP? That seems to take the meta a bit too far in my book.
---
libertarians in the us are just republicans who like weed fwiw

If some one gets offended and decides to stop playing eve!

Goons killed my mother to get a seat on the council. CSM lobbyists wouldn't let me open an investigation because while I had a seat... I was not granted the rank of shill. So after my uncle accidentally cut my arm off in a 67% efficiency efficiency refining accident I went into dust 514 to seek out an honorable hero to avenge her and all I got was a fucking abyssal fragment and a 2 hour skill booster. 
---
So yeah. I'm a bit upset about the quality of leadership in my internet spaceships game.
---

---
CCP said the CSM brought it to their attention. We want the Brisc report.
---
Well we still don’t know if someone from the csm was deliberately trying to headshot a certain group...
---
Smells like an under the table deal here....

Rapid heavy dual xlasb Raven is the battleship of my heart. Not sure how bad it's considered though.

Probably part of the deal.

&gt;after a while and realizing they would never fall to CONCORD ships, GMs said "okay guys, good show, now knock it off". And they didn't.
---
???

Interesting ! Rapid heavies must be a bit more fun that rapid lights on my Caracal...
---
Have fun with this battleship :)
---
Never going to happen. You have a better (but still very poor) chance appealing to CSM members' conscience directly.

It's been roughly four, four and a half years since I've flown one, and I really only managed to get a couple kills in one.

I'm glad you got cleared and a really hope it was an honest mistake which created this mess. You handled the whole thing like a champ. Respect.
---
&gt;I always say the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.
---
&gt;Simply because you don't have evidence that something does exist does not mean you have evidence of something that doesn't exist.
---
&gt;Well, what I'm saying is that there are known knowns and that there are known unknowns. But there are also unknown unknowns; things we don't know that we don't know.
---
Is...is olmeca a RL Gin Rummy??
---
But you aren’t well argued, in the least. People shitpost on your threads because you create narratives or scenarios derived from pure speculation and imagination. Not one claim or argument point you make has any real basis, nor does any of your useless ramblings matter because CCP already publicly issued a full exoneration. 
---
You perpetually attempt to create narratives that are threaded together solely by false dichotomies using arguments of ignorance. You are embarrassingly bad at using Socratic Method strategy to push your long-winded rambling of informal fallacies to the point it physically hurts my brain if I accidentally read a sentence in your post. You are a failure at every aspect in the art of argument and you should attempt to learn from these disastrous displays of delusional posts.

LMAO YOU WERE FUCKING WRONG

---
&gt;  Granted, it was Brisc who tied his real-life identity to his Eve character, but it should have been taken into account nonetheless
---
But there's nothing wrong with that... and it's not like they made the accusation and *then* he tied his IRL identity to his account. They knew his identity was public and issued a public statement.
---
&gt; I feel sorry for all the people who have been unjustly banned but never compensated because they weren't newsworthy enough.
---
While that sucks it's not really the ban that made this a big deal. It was the public accusation. I'd hate to get unjustly banned from playing a game... I'd hate unjustly losing business and income in my real life even more.
---
I wasn't talking about the law but industry guidelines.

I agree on the Drake Navy. I've been playing with one in standing as a quick dps boat. 1600m/s cold, 81k ehp, and 407dps from heavy missiles alone at 51km with selectable damage. It's a pretty great little ship.
---
That's unfortunate.
---
People claim/talk as if he is innocent.
---
"Innocent until proven guilty" is a principle of law about whether someone should be legally punished. It doesn't apply to reddit analyses on whether some CSM did insider trading or not. Think about it this way. If CCP adhered to that principle (that they should have court-proof evidence before banning anyone) %90 of bans would have been reverted.
---
Asking the important questions.
---
I’d say one fitted with modules. But that’s a rough guess.

I dunno. [This guy](https://zkillboard.com/character/2113809738/kills/) seems to like them still
---
Wanting to know something and starting a head hunt are two different things. I would love to know, but asking ccp for this information will not get you anywhere.
---
For all any of us know it was a csm member who felt he needed to say something to protect the game and the csm. It would be very unprofessional of ccp to release that info.
---
Shut up attention seeking retard.
---
Wasnt he the goon that got some alliance leader banned? CCP is protecting the goons?
---
Really eating those words now, huh buddy?
---
Ya'll look like fucking retards with todays blog from CCP.
---
Technically the csm who reported brisc to ccp did nothing wrong, as voicing concerns isn't really outright framing
---
As the "CSM" brought it to CCP's attention then we should insist it be included in the CSM minutes.

Glad you got your name cleared Brisc.

That is very true. The CSM is supposed to work on our behalf and be transparent.

Well guess what, you're a moron.

Welp, this is embarrassing.

You're a massive fucking moron.

Its doom are we really surprised he turned out to be completely wrong?

Skirmish links are a hell of a drug
---
We have way more partial evidence on Brisc than this guy had on WMDs in Iraq. And while they destroyed the country I am not arguing in favor of a punishment/ban either.
---
Lol. Come join amok and learn the truth of it.
---
After poking around a bit I heard some interesting information. This was basically decided using the same standard of proof as other similar cases. What wasn't the same is the person they banned. Given the fact that the banning was largely unpopular with a substantial number of active players and the looming threat of possible legal action, CCP decided to take another look. 
---
As we all know, CCP's standard of proof isn't going to be the same standard of proof as you would need in a court of law. While in their judgement the information they had along with the evidence they gathered was enough to convince them, it was highly probable that it would not be enough to defend their actions in a law suit. So rather than waste all of the time and money having to deal with a possible lawsuit over the matter, it was easier to allow the accounts to be reinstated along with the condition that Brisc resign from CSM to avoid further issue. 
---
That's why CCP isn't sharing any of the information regarding what went on.
---
What a gross person
---
Everything is confirmation to the sufficiently biased.
---
Hmm.

I still love my cripple [solo PvP Imicus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82SMTml5zOM).

I am really sad Brisc resigns. There is a lot to do regarding bans, community team and communication at general from CCP and who else could be better hunter then the original prey.
---
Thought you were going to say Bismarck for a sec
---
&gt;I cannot fathom how they possibly could have handled this worse.
---
They could have doubled down and banned anyone who publicly dissented.
---
Probably not, considering he is totally innocent and was 100% right.
---
Imagine being mentally unstable, living alone, no mates etc grinding for ten+ years and then being banned for nothing and nobody backs you up for being innocent. What would happen to that person? Suicide? Stranger things have happened and CCP should consider these things in the future.
---
Guess what fucktard.
---
Me too.
---
Wow this dude has issues
---
hes talking about pvp.. not mining or ratting
---
The steps some folks will go to simply to avoid acknowledging that they made a mistake.
---
I commented on the post back when he posted it. He got called put, refused to honor his bet with bobfrommarketing, and then dodged every callout afterwards
---
I haven't played this game since ~2014, and this comment made me feel hilariously nostalgic.
---
Oooo we've got ourselves a spicy spacenerd.
---
Absolutely not.
---
CCP needs to be held responsible for their actions. But CCP is not responsible for a player's action of combining his player character with his real life persona. That, by itself, is the responsibility of the player and the player alone.
---
CCP fucked up and deserves the roast.
---
This is actually against the rules. Those new rules were implemented within the last month.

Dual boxing the same fight is easy once adjusted. I get a bit flustered above 3 clients in the same fight. At least a couple of times a years i find myself in 2 fights at once in different regions, that get rough as i usually have dual box in one fight and single box in another, think of it as an exercise in madness. Honestly it took me years of practice plus some muscle memory to manage, i might just be slow xD

Damn buddy, gotta those deflectors set to maximum huh?

I get that my first answer was short  but I was being serious. I would wager half of null runs a subcap pilot plus a cap pilot. That's the tip of the iceberg.

Lets play a hypothetical game, what would convince you that Brisc didn't do anything?

Can you name something, even hypothetically?

remove cynos too.

Top post op. moral of the story r/eve don't believe everything that the media or companies tell us.
---
by far the most satisfying post on eve reddit in the history of ever.  There is nothing better than watching people riding high on their moral superiority being gut-punched straight back into the ground.
---
While I'm genuinely curious I believe this should be treated how the initial brisc rubal allegation should have been treated. It should be investigated if credible and proved before any announcements.
---
I gotta say I apologize for believing CCP prima facie and leaking all over every associated reddit post. I honestly thought that they would not act in such a ridiculous manner without substantiating their claims. I am embarrassed to have had trusted their judgment. I should have known better lol.
---
Just out of curiosity, could the person who made the initial claims that lead CCP to investigate end up being sued (if they are US based) since it caused actual IRL damage to Brisc's reputation?
---
&gt; Of course we were going to cover it.
---
10 klicks are better than none i guess
---
Damn man, just the effort you put into this is impressive.
---
Who the fuck is gullible enough to believe any of what you wrote? 0_o
---
This is amplified by the tone they used, too: "Hey Brisc and his alliance are abusing his CSM to invest in stuff" is quite different from"Prices on these things just skyrocketed before you announced it, could you look into it?"
---
Well, I think I might try some tonight then. 
---
It'll be good to venture back into my past :P
---
Hard pass, would require me actually logging in.
---
&gt;I presume this is more a meme now-a-days than actual point.  
---
&gt;Bot accounts consume PLEX (raising it's price) and that PLEX is paid by someone who needs ISK. Presuming these bots would exists, then there would be less demand for PLEX, thus maybe lowering it's price. Question becomes, would that require more real money investment to get same amount of ISK or would it lower it as it's not so worthwhile to get ISK using real money. Any case, CCP banning the bots should directly effect their income. Indirectly they probably would get more subscribers as players wouldn't be annoyed by the bots.
---
Bots damage plex economy in 3 primary ways. there are more but these 2 are the big ones.
---
First they need plex for all their accounts for anything above alpha, thus putting more demand on plex, less available plex for everyone else = higher prices.
---
Second they pump a stupid amount of ISK into the game economy which normal people playing 1-2 accounts can not do or have any hope to compete with. This ISK eventually makes it down to everyone playing the game, which causes plex prices to rise as more people are willing to pay them.
---
Third is they cause absurd amount of resources such as minerals from Rorq bots to make it into the game causing issues such as capital proliferation, skewed metas, corps being pushed own of the game etc. This also forces opposed entities (corps / alliances) to bot as well or die out due being unable to compete within the scope of the rules of the game.
---
As you stated, short term CCP makes more money on it, but long term due to players leaving from the issues proliferated by bots and jsut being unable to compete in a legit way or plainly getting sick and tired of them, they lose money because they lose customers.
---
Not at all. They still had every right to ban him from the get go because again, it's not a criminal court in USA, it's an MMO.
---
They were able to unban them, because they had precise logging of what was going on in the game. To think they wouldn't is still stupid
---
I've had that new bit from Sabaton stuck in my head all day. I get the feeling you have too.

---
&gt; Heh, why? It's just some dude who got wrongly accused and punished of something he didn't do.
---
A lot of people get banhammered for shit they didn´t do in this game. It´s just that the CCP doesn´t give a fuck because these püeople don´t have a basis to wreck them in court like Brisc had with his openly proclaimed NDA breach.

The worst decisions in my life have consisted of:

"Doesn't exonerate."

This is the kind of tinfoil this sub needs.

In the time I was able to hang out with Brisc and the rest of my Init. wingmen I knew, without a doubt this was entirely horseshit. This is not the way Init. is run and this was not the type of man Brisc is.
---
I'm glad this matter is settled.

yeah, Denmark

"Management will always be bad" is the fifth law of thermodynamics

Sounds like the typical CCP way of thinking but I'd prefer if the actual problem gets fixed.
---
No one forced CCP to publicly accuse him of breaking the NDA.
---
Can't
---
Did you skip over what Innominate said? They could have told me to go fuck myself, but they didn't. They went out of their way to fix this, acknowledged they made a mistake and apologized for it. I give them credit for that, even if others may not. 
---
I'm an adult, so I rarely, if ever, hold grudges. And I also believe in forgiveness.
---
Well that seems fair enough.
---
That describes about 99% of all jobs in the world.
---
MFW everyone in this sub attacked brisc for over a day when they all believed CCP was right. Now they're all sorry for the guy.
---
Interesting
---
lmao if you think CCP is in the position to fire anyone while expecting to get a solid substitute. well, besides management maybe, but you could just pull a self employed fisherman from the pier down the street and he would probably do a better job.
---
TLDR: Disregard this post, OP sucks cocks.
---
&gt; I mean my money would be along the lines of this: Brisc told his 2 corp mates
---
Stahp right there friendo. Pando and Dark Shines are in different corps from each other and Brisc.

The rest of your speculation continues to be wrong.

Also lol "backlash"? What fucking backlash? Reddit jumped on this like starving wolves, and the fuckBrisc grrGon hat INIT was all that could be heard.

3)cycle links and enter plex

5)Bask at new zkill solo stats +12 points ftw

6)apply to snuff once your kb is shiny enough

7)repeat but bring a revenant to the ping instead of comet, your too elite for that

8)complain about black rise dying

Imagine on top of that, that this could be a rumour spread by a player, spread outide the game, to make damages and with the sole purpose of having an advantage inside the game, while the innocent is banned and his reputation destroyed.
---
I'm not important in life, but my reputation is all I have, and in mt gaming years mean people tries to attack me like this and I would be not surprised if this was one of these out-of-the-game vendetta against him.
---
The CSM isn’t a team based competition, there is no ‘opposing CSM’.
---
Honestly, there is no avoiding them. Set them as red to you and keep an eye on local. They pop in, dock up. They are a determined group to just collect salt from anyone they can really.
---
Set your destination to Amarr, then Jita, Then Dodixie and then Amarr again, don't mine in any of the systems along that route and you will probably never encounter them again.

Pay the permit, it is only 10m, and enjoy mining. Don't be a Goofus and afk mine like a bot.

this sounds oddly specific

Filing false reports is very much a crime, if its done with malicious intent.
---
Lmao GSM
---
Depends on what kind of fleet you are in and tidi or not:
---
- In heavy tidi you can at least quadbox with Titan/Super/Dread/Apostle. A Super actually soaks up most of your APM without it you can box as many accounts as you have and your PC is able to.
---
- Big nullsec fleets, active dualbox anything. Singlebox logi if numbers allow it. Ceptor cynos can be tripleboxed on the road.
---
- Smallscale fleets, active dualbox main+scout/tackle. Singlebox logi. In a pro kiting fleet singleboxing is almost necessary and you just park your 2nd ship somewhere.
---
Lol, so we're gonna start this bullshit now?
---
"He's got influence so he obviously did something wrong and just strongarmed CCP into unbanning him and releasing a statement"
---
Goddamn, you're almost as fucking stupid as the people who jumped on the initial bandwagon.
---
His breakdown now involves Endgame Spoilers, So if you have yet to watch the movie and don't want spoilers, Stay away from his twitter.
---
Set them red, stay awake, keep your head cool.
---
So how many other times has CCP knee jerk banned people and because they weren't a high and mighty CSM and Politician CCP just moved on and ignored their appeals? 
---
Especially when it was possibly a person meta gaming ccp like this and getting someone banned for fabricated lies and them just believing it.
---
I know only what I have read from CCP and they have not made any claims to what he did. They have since declared him innocent. I believe that folk are innocent until proven guilty with evidence. 
---
So as far as this issue is concerned it is over. As to what Brisc has done for the players and the game I am satisfied with his efforts to date. I think he has a decent understanding and sees things from a different perspective than most of the CSM.
---
&gt; worth playing for us.
---
casusals?
---
This is not accurate.
---
I think it's in everyone's best interest to know who in the CSM made the accusation to CCP
---
Here's the point: he did his best for you shitters, but you're all so humourless and up your own arses about how amazing you are for living in :spookyspace: that any time he said anything that wasn't kissing your arse, you chimped out.
---
And now who on the CSM do you expect will be keen to follow his example and reach out to you, do you think?
---
Get out of highsec, fly cheap ships/instawarpers when there. If you want to do mining/industry/ratting go to nullsec, if you like pvp you can go lowsec/nullsec/wormhole (I don't recommend that last for a new player).
---
Technically they had to as he has a very visible position, the character Brisc Rubal. That they fucked up the accusation is a different discussion. I've so far not heard any good reason from you that would give any remotely convincing argument to claim CCP should be responsible for the actions of a player that **willingly** chose to connect his real life to his game persona. Come up with one, please? :)
---
Here's the thing though dipshit, he signed an NDA and that's what they accused him of breaking.
---
By law that has to be disclosed to his bar association, depending on where he lives. Which is Texas, which means yes, it has to be disclosed.
---
So that could have very, very, very real implications on his life. Regardless of him tying himself to his character.
---
its meant for an on-boarding guide for new ppl 
---
I heard new player retention was an issue for this game.
---
I want to know who ran to CCP So i can avoid voting for them next time
---
Probably podded on the in-gate.
---
Any new ingame grudges you need to inform the community about? I appreciate the adult reaction to the real life part but if this spills into the game I feel it's entirely proper to hold one hell of a grudge.
---
100% false. I use to fly with some of them. They cover all kinds of ranges and systems. A lot of them have about 3 or 4 alts that they hunt with too.
---
So they mostly just patrol newbie areas to kill miners?
---
bro link that in discord if you could.
---
invading GOTG would be very nice....
---
Bolters at 50 paces.
---
KK.  I mean so far it isn't an issue since a single load of ore pays triple for my ship, so their ganks are meaningless.  But I'll soon be able to use barges and the costs of losing a ship will go up drastically.  And I know very little about how to not die in PVP.
---
The forums were beautiful once...a long time ago.
---
I miss the old forum. Was default grey too...better than white ugh
---
lol this is pure polished shit. Code honors mining permits like Trump pays his taxes. Always some loophole.
---
because reporting someone is not the same as banning them, players don't decide if someone is doing bannable stuff they send to ccp to decide if they have suspicions.
---
Yeah. Remember the intermediate blog when ccp was allabout "the sanctity of the csm"? We should know who broke it.
---
As far as change I'd like to see? A local delay directly tied to gate-cloak would probably be a better way to handle local. I'd also like to see either sites being re-worked with enough tackle that you aren't free to immediately leave a site whenever you want, or a complete overall of ESSs. Ideally they would be need to account for a significant portion of ISK made from a site, be impossible to place "safely' (ex. on-grid with a POS, if a fully spawned site, ect.), and be valuable enough that they are worth both attacking and defending.
---
As far as a loki goes, one web is usually not enough to hold a 100mn cruiser, and have you tried to fit dual webs on a nullified loki and still tank? Aside form that since when did you need to scram something to hold it down? A decently tanked VNI can survive on grid long enough for friends to arrive, and if you aren't relying on the VNI itself for a cyno then it should be able to tackle a loki long enough for a ceptor and cyno to arrive as well. Regardless, the loki dose need some sort of nerf as it is the best T3 by far. A PG nerf or something similar would go a long way.
---
&gt; Also, nobody smart takes gates blind, they have scouts, so even if you do manage to trap them in a pipe, get people organized and waiting, ignoring everything else in your space, the gang can agree to afk for 5 min and come back.
---
Another thing to consider here is what is the goal of the roaming fleet. Is it to gank VNIs or is it to get a fight? VNI kills are alright, but if that's all you're after hunting quickly looses it's appeal. Many of the people out roaming NS are looking for a fight. It's why you see small groups shooting rorquals or tackling carriers. It's not that they want to kill that ship in particular, they instead want to fight the response fleet. That is not to say there aren't people who go whaling, but none of these changes would impact a groups ability to drop the hammer to defend their caps. Seeing how caps can pre-align while in a site and easily cyno in support anyways, this sort of change wouldn't make capitol ratting significantly more dangerous for anyone watching grid for a decloaking ship.
---
&gt;That's not going to happen, though. Rattlesnakes are already uncommon enough for ratting, because of how expensive they are to replace.
---
This may be true, but ratting the safest it's ever been, yet the progression path is cruiser&gt;carrier&gt;super. This is probably more the result of skill injectors then anything else. The fact that you can turn your ISK into SP means there is no need to take the intermediate step of flying a snake while you train cap skills. The  only way to fix this might be to make profitable anomalies that are best run by BSs, either by making anomalies that have specific anti-cap waves, or by gating the anomalies, or by making some sites perma-tackle caps while they remain un-cleared. They would also need to be either un-runable, or at least terrible ISK/hr in cruisers and below. I won't claim any of these are good ideas, but something this extreme way be the only way to get people out in BSs specifically. Weather the goal itself is worth the dev time is another question entirely. I'd say yes, but I also just want solo-blopsing to be in a better place then it is currently.
---
&gt; The other ships have a pretty bad isk/hr/effort compared to other stuff like mining, exploring, or abyssals.
---
Well, miners and abyssal runners are also great targets in NS, and while you would likely see an uptic in exploration, a significant increase would drive down salvage prices. It would also mean more competition for the same sites, as the number of explorers a region can support is an order of magnitude smaller then the number of ratters it can. Abyssal prices might also crash if you saw that many more people running abyssal sites. A big difference here is that people are moving from generating ISK, to generating items that are sold for ISK.

One thing you seem to be saying though is that any significant nerf to safety would mean most people who rat in NS would simply stop ratting, and move to something else. I would argue that while you would see some movement you wouldn't see the mass exodus you are calming we would. It's not like people have stopped ratting because local broke in the past. I strongly believe eve players would instead adapt. Even if we see people moving to other forms if ISK generation, many of those are also dangerous, or can't support the large number of people who would be moving to them. It's not like all of the NS ratters could just move to HS incursions.
---
The real travesty here is I’m not sure if there’s any recourse for people who use reddit in Light mode.
---
Gate keeping someone elses rage levels is pretty hilarious.
---
Any communication that would break the NDA would happen outside the game so CCP would have no "hard" evidence.  Just really suspicious activity that aligns with the tip.  That would probably not hold up in court.  Siting the NDA makes this all way more serious than just a run of the mill ban.  It's also possible that what they thought was suspicious, turned out to be activity that had been going on for years i.e. clearly not in response to breaking the NDA.  Based on the final statement, CCP won't ever give full details so all we can do is speculate.
---
I absolutely love this!
---
Storm Bolter, Heavy Bolter or Mega Bolter? Answer: Yes.
---
All depends on what you want out of the game.
---
- Stay in Hisec and keep an eye out for them if you wanna chill
---
- Go exploring if you wanna make isk
---
- Look for fights in lowsec if you want to learn to PvP
---
- Or join a nullsec corp if you want a compromise between the three.  Listen to your corpies and never stop learning.
---
- Join a wormhole corp if you have time and want all the isk and all the fights there are.
---
And always remember, your ship is lost when you press Undock. If you can't bear to lose it, don't fly it.
---
Someone needs to get brisc report on Wikileaks
---
PR wise that would be by far the best thing to do
---
So he did something suspicious, the CSM reported him, and then CCP blew it way out of proportion and banned him?
---
Though that may be true, a lot of his arguments are at least thought out, compared to 90% of the reactionary sperg we see on this sub.
---
My Chimera is a beautiful mess that I love to rat in.
---
Its OK to be white 👌 🤡🌎
---
Once you have enough isk/sp to feel somewhat comfortable join a corp in LS, WH or NS, sell everything you have and get the fuck out of HS; nothing for you there really.
---
Lol. Okay man.
---
You're pretty dumb to just believe everything Brisc or CCP tells you. I'm not going to immediately accuse them of lying, but it definitely smells a bit weird.
---
Yup.
---
Can I point you to this guy:

---
I mined in hisec for almost 2 years. I saw code propaganda, secure warning cans and shit all over the place. Never actually saw a member once. And i was 3 jumps from dodixie.
---
CCP can't honestly be expected to survive solely on EVE though - like I hate this attitude that CCP needs to be a one-trick pony. It's good they're trying things and attempting to grow rather than stagnating and dying completely.
---
Honest question
---
Join a newbie Corp in null and be showered with isk while learning the game from vets.
---
I dual box a lot, typically I target solo roamers/pair roamers. Usually I use an interceptor or assault frigate to establish tackle, and than kill with a cruiser/battlecruiser, tactical destroyer/kikimora, or second assault frigate. It can be difficult, I recommend low management ships, i.e. tackle, approach or set orbit, turn reps/prop on, then focus on getting your dps ship on it.
---
This man has a point.
---
Easy there Alex jones
---
No one is saying that CCP should be responsible for *his* actions. The squealing seems to be because they were forced to take responsibility for theirs.
---
Easy there, Gullible.
---
My personal favorite it the battle heron. Just roaming WHs exploring and waiting for that unsuspecting bomber or astero to try and drop on you. you could probably take it out to Stain and hunt sabers as well.
---
tbf the bar there is pretty low
---
The benefit was that it got me elected to the CSM. The risk was that it got me elected to the CSM.
---
&gt; I'm an adult, so I rarely, if ever, hold grudges. And I also believe in forgiveness and baby jeebus.
---
lmbo. did your speech writer come up with that?
---
I enjoy a good witch hunt as much as the rest of r/eve, However, if you oust someone for raising a non-malicious concern to CCP (if it was a non-malicious concern) it sets a really bad precedent that if you call someone out for doing something wrong you will get punished for it. I personally don't care to know who. I'll probably speculate on fleet comms until the game servers shut down for good. But punishing someone for reporting is equivalent to punishing someone for reporting what they think is a crime, the perpetrator going to prison for 30 years, and come to find out the police fucked the investigation up from the beginning.   
---
I do hope, that CCP is investigating the possibility of malicious actions and rightly holding those accountable IF THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED.
---
I'm sitting on 100 million ISK and have a retriever waiting for my skill training.  I can probably earn enough mining like this.
---
I'll start looking out for a corp to join.
---
Der Scheissepfostenwerfer.
---
I never had to go farther than that statement. Once we started talking, things were cleared up pretty quickly.
---
I don't understand why people are talking about whether it would "hold up in court". I don't think there was ever any indication that this would go to court, and I don't see how that would ever occur considering the way EULAs work. Am I wrong?
---
Okay CSM, it's your turn.  Come out with your apology.  As I understood when the news originally broke, it was other CSM members who reported the \*alleged\* violation(s).
---
Not really. Nobodies get banned for RMTing, which is easily proven by checking transactions. Bric got banned based on hearsay and assumptions.
---
partially. potentially. 99,99% of people don´t make it their profession though.
---
my dude, once you leave highsec, the world is open to you. Be it in Nullsec, Lowsec as a pirate, or even weirdo WH space.
---
JUST JOIN HORDE OR KARMAFLEET OR DREDDIT OR BRAVE NEWBIES THEY WILL TEACH YOU SO MUCH LIKE SPINNING A VEXOR NAVY ISSUE IN A FORSAKEN HUB AND WAITING FOR A PING
---
DAE SPACE DRUNKS WITH BROS XD???
---
That's how you play eve dude.
---
How could they possibly have faced legal action over this considering how EULAs work?
---
I don’t blame her. It does seem like an awful lot of emotional energy to expend on a game.
---
Did you just write a blog about reddit posters and then repost it back to reddit?
---
Is this redditception?
---
are you retarded
---
what if it wasn't malicious you incredible smoothbrain
---
The original post by the devs was well articulated with what little it did reveal. I dont think it was a miscommunication. Previously they have released updates and made it a point to say the CSM was behind the new update when they had heard nothing of it. What I'd like to know was this the case or did the information really come to light from a CSM member.
---
Go back to your shitty ass twitch channel and spew your verbal vomit there.

Guess Ive run into a lot of shit hecate pilots.

Dude has a family and a job. I don't blame him.
---
Here's the thing. I've been using the Brisc character in every MMO I've played since 2003. The name "Brisc" itself is an amalgam of my first and last names. Linking Brisc and my real life persona would have taken anybody ten seconds. 
---
I could have just run for CSM without bringing it up, and the chances were as soon as I did a commercial that had my face in it, or one of the talk shows, or even pointed out what I did for a living, I would have been doxxed. 
---
I've been playing games, blogging, and the like on the internet for two decades. I made a conscious decision back in 2008 to only write things under my real name, because I was willing to stand by what I wrote, unlike many folks on the internet. I felt the same way about this. 
---
I think it's too easy to pretend that the folks behind the screen or behind the other toon aren't real people, and that leads to bad things. Yes, this was bad as well, but this wasn't something I ever expected would happen.
---
tl;dr just for you
---
You: "No major publication will say anything about Brisc being innocent."
---
Me: "Bet you are wrong."
---
You: "You are naive."
---
PcGamer posts a new article about Brisc being innocent less then an hour after the devblog.
---
Me: "Told you."
---
You: "I'm a sore loser."
---
So did CCP release any real life info about the guy in connection with his breach? If so wouldn't Brisc have a defamation lawsuit he could pursue?
---
Not directly. There is no way to see only mission NPC kills. You can however check systems that have individual agents and see if that system and it's surrounding systems are active. Jumps is something else you can look at as may missions have you go one system over to run it.
---
Get in a corp dude. You don't have to make friends with them if you very don't want to.
---
PH are 7 or 8 jumps for jita, they will give you ventures for free if you loss it. Most newbean skill books are free too. You will earn 4 times the cash if not more in null sec. Moon mining can be very social will 30-90 people on comms chatting and a caretaker give help and advice out to newbeans. Our miners are known for killing more then they lose when people do come to play with us.
---
Disclaimer: a lot of this can be said about the other newbro alliances, do a bit of home work and choose which alliance sounds good to you.
---
Sent it as in-game mail along with a little info. I should clarify that its 1600m/s with the skirmish command burst on. You might also get better damage if you have Caldari Battlecruiser V, since I only have IV.
---
This is a bad post.
---
I feel like your skillset could have gotten you elected to the CSM without needing to bring in your past experiences. But bygones be bygones. Hopefully your stress levels are back to normal as is life. Best wishes
---
looks like he just got... BAMBOOZLE'D!!
---
That's the first thing I thought, wonder who the initial CSM reports came from, and if they're not imperium, how long before init is burning them lol.
---
This is what lawyers do. We represent people. I'm sorry you seem to think that's a bad thing.
---
I write my own speeches. I used to write them for a cabinet secretary, so I'm kind of good at it.
---
Well I was debating on whether or not to continue giving money to CCP but with this massive cock up I think I'm just gonna let it lapse.

No new ones, no.

you've seen the report then?

Given that you publically accused a lawyer and lobbyist of an ethics violation... court is a possibility.

So I'm worth near a half billion dollars with a rapidly shrinking fan base and a mistaken belief that I can change the face of online gaming so that I might claim prima nocta on the fine blonde ladies of the island?

---
Oh I want to fly a pancake now! I forgot about them.
---
After having just survived folks making unfounded accusations about me, I'm not going to turn around and do the same thing to somebody else. I'm not an asshole. 
---
There's no reason to waste time on a witch hunt that will never go anywhere.
---
It might have been as innocent looking as "yo that seems fishy, check it out". CCP jumps to a conclusion and the rest is history.     
---
How could they be certain it really was malicious? I doubt they'd start the next shitstorm right away...
---
it's best to be able to have an open reporting system so in cases where the actually are shenanigans, it gets brought up quickly.
---
However, the onus is on the investigator to do a complete and thorough investigation and come up with the best answer. Which we can see didn't happen here.
---
Punishing the one reporting, even if it was done with ill-intent isn't the solution.
---
Back a few years ago in RvB our Battle Venture fleet turned up outnumbered to a brawl vs Blue republic. 
---
We won only losing half our ships.
---
The windows hosts file is a glorious thing! If I get hit with a paywall on a news site I'll just immmediately close that shit and find the story fot free elsewhere. Easy fix.
---
No, Grath's thoughts about Brisc were bad posts.  This post is a crime against brains.
---
We don't even know if Peligro was involved in this, so no reason to pitchfork onto him
---
They made a mistake, they admitted it, and they owned it. That earns them the benefit of the doubt from me, since it's more than most people or corporations would do.
---
Brisc died for our memes
---
Honestly, if mining is your thing, try to find a corp in null. You wont regret it.
---
True, I'm just going off the zkill estimations
---
I personally believe all of the csm are feeding intel to their contacts.   I doubted the accusation because they cited hearsay as their only evidence and nothing else.  I dont like the guy, but I sure as hell want them to have to prove somebody broke the rules before the start swinging the ban hammer.
---
spend a week fixing a tool that should have been fixed at least a few months ago.

---
its almost like ccp is shifting the game to a pve experience
---
jin why do you waste your energy on this trash company?
---
Why? If the CSM member had reason to believe it was true then passed that info along to CCP its not their fault?
---
As CCP originally found him guilty there was something dodgey that happened regardless of whether he directly did anything.
---
Very true. I can still hear themittani quoting what a Russian said to him once which freaked him out (and everyone else)... "Find out where he lives".
---
I really really appreciate your efforts to make this happen, Jin. Like legit, thank you.
---
That said, between the original steamfleet fiasco and the brisc thing, fuck CCP's trustworthiness and word.

Tbh his real life career should've *never* been brought up. It has zero relevance to in-game shenanigans. Change my fucking mind. You can't. 
---
u/deltaxi idk if you dragged your career into this first, or if someone else did. But telling this community you're a career lobbyist was only inviting more and more negative fuel for the fire. People hate lobbyists. And for good reason. But that's irrelevant.
---
Just my two cents.
---
Had this been different, and you actually were guilty of said shenanigans, the topic and investigation should've stayed solely with said in-game shenanigans. What you do for a living in the real world shouldn't have any relevance whatsoever.
---
Tl;dr dont bring real life into eve politics, gives everyone more ammo to use against you.
---
That would solve nothing, CODE still regularly blows up permit holders last I heard...
---
Which is why he says not to mine there duh.

 "Good news, Boppers: The big alert has been called off. It turns out that the early reports were wrong, all wrong. Now for that group out there that had such a hard time getting home, sorry about that. I guess the only thing we can do is play you a song. "
---
I've been using the persona "Aelonius" with most online games and otherwise, even having one of the many toons named such in EVE. A quick search will easily find more about me in a private setting, but I've accepted that risk because that's one I take. I do write most of my unfiltered thoughts under that persona as well, because for me they are one and the same. But that is my own responsibility. It is my own brand, my own choice to heavily use such a name and I've made peace with it, as you have apparently. As such, I do not hold CCP responsible for fuck-ups beyond what they can control.
---
I am sure they will work with you to figure this out and get to the bottom of this, and I don't doubt a second that there will be internal consequences of these actions. But I am simply stating that it's not CCPs responsibility to ensure that whenever something becomes public, right or wrong, that this does not have a direct impact on your personal life. It is their job to ensure that the information they store is protected (which they did) and that they treat you justly (which they did not). 
---
One last note.
---
For some people, the persona online is equal to the persona in real life. More power to them. But over the years I've learned to see the two entirely separate because the actions of one online do not reflect on the true personality behind it. I've met people in-game that I despise thoroughly, yet when we met in real life, they were VERY different. As such, I treat Brisc Rubal and the person behind it usually as separate entities.

If you really want a bit of security, though still not absolute... if you've got a ship that will let you quickly run security missions, do so. Check each mission area for ore as you do them, quite a few have pockets of ore that you can mine. Sometimes it's just a little bit, but sometimes it can be quite a substantial amount. It won't make you immune to them making an attempt on you, but actually having to break out scan probes is usually more work than they're willing to commit. As others have said, make CODE pilots red top you so you can see them in local. If they show in your system, align up and start d-scanning for combat probes or catalysts. If you see either in your immediate area in d-scan dock up. At the minium, it should by you more reaction time.

Text transcript or tl;dl?
---
Hello tournament fans,
---
Following on from our announcement last week we wish to bring you a further update on the progression of the tournament and it’s future schedule.
---
We would like to thank CCP for taking the time to get the tool to a point where we can run competitive matches on Thunderdome.
---
After an evaluation of the tool performed over the past few days, we have come to the conclusion in cooperation with the teams that running a tournament will be possible. However, due to technical limitations, we no longer believe that a live stream would be of the quality we wish to provide to our audience.
---
We know that many of you were looking forward to seeing this event play out live, so this news will be a disappointment. In lieu of this we are intending to provide a series of recordings showcasing the matches that were able to take place, including commentary from the broadcast talent within a few weeks.
---
Unfortunately, this deviation from the original plan has led to a reduction in the number of participants. We would like to thank them for the hard work they spent getting to this point, and understand their reasons and support them in their decision.
---
Your continued interest in the tournament is appreciated, and would like to thank the EVE community for their support during this time. We hope you enjoy the videos when they’re available.
---
Fly safe,

If you're so informed why don't you tell us? You're not under NDA.
---
Or better yet, just nuke the whole CSM.
---
It's what you say in either case if you're threatened with lawyers.
---
Don't worry, I joined around the Fountain War so I substitued you.
---
&gt; is it still Goons, Grrrr or are they the "good guys" now?
---
Goons always were the good duys, though, duh.
---
Thanks for an elaborate analysis of the problem. 
---
Your proposed solutions are much surgical and noninvasive to general uses of booshing compared to other proposals as well, which is cool.
---

---
Yes.  What are you talking about? He was on the CSM and his RL name was put out there.  How can he separate the two at that point? 
---
If I have to explain it any more than that you'll never get it.
---
Question, does anything prevent the teams or commentators themselves from streaming at lower quality?
---
(Not saying they should, just curious)
---
It actually started changing summer 2008, but the final nails happened with dominion in 2009.
---
Anyways, first my definition of a pirate: Someone who makes a living of loot and ransom, and following a general set of rules common among the larger community of pirates. Sec status don't matter, it is equally as correct to call someone with -10 an insurgent or a a terrorist. Being a pirate was a life style.
---
So, three things mostly changed.
---
1. Faction warfare brought a large influx of people, low sec before FW had relatively few people. With the faction warfare crowd a large number of predators came as well and you got the foundations of groups like snuff. With the larger numbers of targets you also saw traditions such as ransoms go out the window, as taking the time to ransom wasn't worth it and the split was too small.
---
2. The groups got better organized. Changes to doomsday weapons in dominion meant that logistics ships, which had been viable in low-sec before, now became more widespread. You started seeing honest to god doctrines, which is different to pre dominion fleets which were mostly just double, triple or even quadruple doomsday tanked battleships. Now you started seeing rowing groups of ahacs, again requiring larger numbers and more organisation and offering less opportunities for ransoming or living of loot.
---
3. Points 1 and 2 destroyed the previous balance and cohesion among pirate groups, as well as the "space bushido" that existed. It used to be that if someone dishonored a ransom or a 1v1, they would be ostracized and targeted by the rest of the pirating community. With the influx the policing died away, especially as certain groups fielded fleets that were too large to handle for old-school pirates. Due to the influx of new "pirates" who didn't follow the "code", the basis of ransoms, which was trust in the general pirating community, went away, and with it pirating.
---
Anyone who claims to be a pirate post 2009 is basically just pretending, unless they live in like bumfuck nowhere, like solitude or some shit.
---
Earth is flat too!
---
get a procurer. i once witness local ganker cry why the belt is full with procurers and skiff
---
Big if true
---
Black market value is different. It's about $500 for 100b.
---
If you read Brisc's response to the banning the wording is definitely there to insinuate it. That along with a large mass of players clamoring for it made it a real enough perceived threat.
---
Personally I usually box an interdictor + a Logi, I only have 1 screen though so sometimes the doctor sits cloaked at a ping or just dies while I pay attention to spreading reps. Sometimes when I feel lazy I will go down to either or.
---
Mouth breathers generally look for the loudest most obnoxious daytime snorer to follow... After years of perfecting his technique he suddenly looked around and there was an army of mouth breathers around him drawn to the sound of his breath that summoned them to him like lost infants searching for their mouth breathing mothers.
---
good, they gank you anyway even if you bought it.
---
Your bulletpoints can work both ways.
---
&gt; No other CSM was implicated for misguiding CCP. 
---
CCP is protecting the CSM members who tried to have Brisc removed using Fake Information
---
&gt; No info was revealed about what made CCP think there was insider trading. 
---
Hence we must assume there is none and that CCP acted only on the fake info provided by the CSM members acting in bad faith.
---
&gt; How CCPs language was so sure, and they actually acted on a ban. People now say CCP was stupid, but maybe they just issued a ban with evidence they typically have, but came across a unique situation later.   
---
&gt; It took quite some time for them to backpedal (it possibly took a legal analysis of the case). 
---
Looking at this now its obvious that CCP's current banning procedure is at best extremely lax and and fails to actually review the information they are given before punishment is given out. When this was upgraded to a possible legal case CCP did a full and through review of the info that they SHOULD have done originally and found that  the information given was false and are now covering their asses as they found the fake information left them open legally. To ensure the "Integrity" of the CSM that falsified the info CCP want to keep any more bad press coming from this hence CCP's "We're not discussing this any further." decision.
---
Now Im NOT saying that the CSM did create fake intel. Im saying your bullet-points are useless as a deciding factor of guilt or innocence.
---
I would like to see CCP release the CSM minutes from that meeting as a measure of transparency however. If there is nothing there that would implicate the CSM members who pushed for Brisc removal then they too would want them released as the rest of the CSM minutes are.
---
I had to scroll too far for this
---
They accused him of breaking the CSM NDA which is a legally binding document.  This has little to do with the EULA.  He could sue them based on that claim being false at which point they would have to show evidence in court that the NDA was actually broken.  I doubt some suspicious market activity in game would be enough.
---
CCP messed up making this about the NDA without hard proof that he broke it.  They have all kinds of leeway with EULA violations but publicly accusing someone of real legal wrongdoing has a way higher standard.  I'm glad Brisc got an apology but I'm a little sad we'll never have all the real details.
---
Yes, when I was on the CSM, I had to do a lot of planning with the family to burn a week's worth of vacation days and make arrangements for child care coverage and other things that would normally be handled while I was at home. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Iceland. But that week in Iceland is also 80 percent of the time sitting in a corporate style Board Room. It's not a vacation in any sense of what I would consider a vacation to be.

I don't even know you, but I know I despise your politics. Despite that, I'd hate to see a dedicated pod pilot like you leave the game.
---
Assholes or not, we all make the game fun by our dedication to creating content and just by playing the game. 
---
We will be worse off to lose you. So come back soon.
---
If I had actually done this, they would have been within their rights to name and shame me. The problem is that I didn't. That's why this kind of thing is risky and why folks generally don't do it - the potential liability if you're wrong outweighs the benefit if you're right. 
---
Regardless, I have gotten tired of reading the "he doxxed himself" or "it was his own fault" line of reasoning - the bottom line is that if somebody is accused of something they didn't do, it doesn't matter whether they're outed under their real name or a pseudonym. The damage is the same, and it comes from the false accusation, not the fact that the accusation was made public. 
---
Regardless, CCP has done everything I've asked them to do and more, and I bear them no ill-will. I know it wasn't their intent to harm me.
---
Doom is probably the nicest person I've met in EVE :^)
---
Nah things really aren't, lots of awful shit used to be tolerated that isn't anymore.
---
Well I agree with that too, but, before they can do that they need to either A. Fix eve so they can properly expand the influence and IP to the point that they can make SUCCESSFUL spinoffs, or B. Make something entirely new, and not banking on adoption of expensive new tech (like VR).
---
They can’t keep half-assing their main game if they’re going to try to do spinoffs like Dust/Nova, Valkyrie, and similar. At the same time, the whole VR sports game was just doomed from the start. Why even take that risk when they’re not a big enough company to just regularly bite those kinds of losses? If they wanted to do something new they should have stuck to a normal PC game. Maybe an MMO, maybe not. MMOs are a somewhat dying genre anyhow. F2P shooters with cosmetic microtransactions are unfortunately the big money makers nowadays. Project Nova was the PERFECT opportunity for them to break into that space and learn from the failures of Dust, but they fucked that up.
---
Rambling aside, the point is, it’s not that I think CCP should only ever do eve - it’s that I think they need to get their ducks in a line first because they have a consistent track record of failure for everything that ISNT eve, and there’s probably a reason for that that they need to address before they start throwing more shit at the wall
---
Yup. Word is Gons are Pearl Abyss so CCP is really a backwater pocket in Fountain now.

yet another flawless prediction from doomchimpchilla, prophet of the retards. no wonder he makes his corpies follow him on twitter, who else would read that drivel
---
The Dragoon fits your question. I haven't flown it recently, so my feeling might have changed, but if you treat it like a frigate, it's a lot more fun than a Tristan. There's a lot of ways to fit a Dragoon and none of them get great results out of it. This allows you to get ignored in some team fights. It's pretty cool how much you can help home defense fleets once you start treating Dragoons like ammo.
---
Somehow, I knew you would weigh in. I would have suggested a 30-60 sec booshee timer on re-booshing. :)
---
Thanks for your effort in trying to get something going and driving CCP to owning up to their promise of supporting player-driven tournament play. I know my friends in Templis appreciate it.
---
A person attending 95% of all meetings throughout their term seems like a decent enough candidate for me to get behind. What the fuck else do you want?
---
Someday we can chat about what my politics are. I'm not your doctrinaire GOPer.
---
Damn for a split second there I thought this pic said "House Wife".
---
INIT was on deployment maybe this will spur them to accomplish something.
---
The most common theory i've heard was that the transaction of darkshines was somehow prompted by information he received from Pando, who got leaks from Brisc about... something? The Fax nerfs?     
---
And Darkshines did sell his Molok afaik. So there is CCP's "evidence".
---
But. But Shines apparently looked for a buyer of his molok for a longer time than Brisc was privy to any relevant information. The timings just don't add up.
---
It could be something else entirely. Point is, that some things might look shady at first glance but if you investigate further they were just an unhappy coincidence.
---
[This clearly wasn't a decision made by lawyers. This was developers being trigger happy with their banhammer. It happend before and it will happen again.
---
Also, love that the court of public opinion is already churning out. The other day Brisc was as cool as a cucumber, now everyone has come out to badmouth him.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bazjd6/official_statement_of_brisc_rubal_on_removal_and/ekgd4rl?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Is there an average or even fixed number of systems away from the source agent that a mission usually takes place? (If that makes sense)
---
reported, telling goons
---
It does have the benefit of meta cloak
---
because nobody expects a venture to kill them.
---
who's gonna warp off after seeing a venture on dscan?
---
Unless you're Brisc's alt, his significant other or you're gaining something from posting this, it feels weird to put this amount of work to make this post, yikes.
---
Well ofc. And no please :)
---
And here I was just not giving a Crap about all of this 👏😐
---
Unfortunately the tool as it currently operates has enough of a delay in it and enough technical inconsistencies that we felt a broadcast would take up too much time (20+ minute breaks for 10 minutes max of gameplay) to be an enjoyable broadcast for the audience.
---
I've heard almost every ship in Eve being criticized at one time or another, so I'm not sure which ships are really "universally" considered bad.
---
I started Gallente so I still have fun with Algos, Atrons, a Myrm on occasion, and fly around an Omen sometimes in kitchen sink fleets.  
---
I don't think Atrons are regarded as particularly bad, at least for a cheap light tackle role, but what do I know.
---
how could we actually *know* that though.  Many probably believe it, but is there any actual proof?
---
Navy Caracal.  It’s like the Orthrus’ retarded cousin, but 1/3 of the price.  With a faction disruptor and RLMLs, I can still point, orbit, and shoot from 30+ KM away with 500+ DPS.
---
I couldn't agree more. No one should be refining at 67%.
---
Get to watch people explode still.  FeelsAmazingMan
---
What part of it do you take issue with?
---
This is pretty spot on.
---
it's possible they convicted on circumstantial evidence.  If I made a high-value speculation, then someone tried to frame one of my friends on the CSM for insider trading, I would look like evidence of that when it's really just a coincidence.
---
You really think CCP has *some* evidence of guilt and still decided to eat a giant bag of PR shit because of some nebulous super-hypothetical libel lawsuit?
---
You really are pants on head retarded aren't you?
---
They don't need "court proof" evidence either way.
---
At first they thought he was guilty, looked again and found more to suggest he wasn't. 
---
Maybe there is something more substantial, maybe not. Don't lose your good nights sleep over it, dude.

Go to a newbro null corp, accumulate wealth from there with mining. Pandemic Horde for example. 
---
Free ventures, moon mining schedules, mining boosts. Totally worth it if you like mining and chill than doing it in highsec with paranoia.
---
The only problem with newbro corps are their high tax rates. But it gives you good kickstart support in mining. Look around.
---
You responded correctly.
---
1)  Add a contact for CODE. (the whole corp/alliance) and set them red.  Then you can see when they are in system and better avoid them.
---
2)  Move to null.  CODE. doesn't go to null, and the money for mining is better (2x at least).  Find a group you like and join up.  I'll suggest Provi, but how safe you'll be depends on where and when you mine...
---
While true, that's not exactly comforting.
---
His obsessive fixation on BNI was evidence enough for me.
---
This shitfest must be making you moist by how easy these articles are to write and the amount of clicks it's going to bring.
---
Just get a seriously tanked barge and name it "Eat Shit CODE."
---
Grath, get back in your box lmao
---
Makes sense
---
Looks like serious about the no tourney thing this year...
---
I don't think they really care about new or not, but whether they can take a target or not.
---
Flying a proc will heavily discourage them (they're quite tanky, usually take 6+ catalysts to kill).  But your best bet is to move to null.
---
Maybe they saw transactions and connected them with some allegations. 
---
After looking closer it didn't really match because of timestamps or whatever else. 
---
That's what i think is most likely, anyway.
---
This makes the most sense imo.
---
The starter systems are off limits, and gankers follow that rule. 
---
Head on over to http://www.minerbumping.com where you can read about tactics and strategy of suicide ganking. Hell, why not try it yourself? Have fun in Eve.

&gt;For 2019, we’ve also decided to take an Alliance Tournament &gt;hiatus while we look at how we can better support competitive &gt;PvP and capsuleer tournaments in the future – both those &gt;hosted by CCP and those by the community.
---
good community support ccp , the At died for this level of support lol
---
There **is no** Pepe Silvia
---
Only go to Provi if you want to be kill fodder for the rest of cluster
---
Well, you deserve the chance to be heard, to say the least. :)
---
Thank you. I know you do not have a high opinion of the CSM, but I wanted to highlight small changes which opened up other niches in the meta, in lieu of huge groundshaking changes to a mechanic which I believe has overall been healthy for the game. 
---
Keep up the good work innovating!
---
careful what you say he is a legit ex-con.
---
So basically you want a nerf for ships which have very specific roles to make the hardcore carebearing safer. The &gt;&gt;Covert&lt;&lt; in the module's name is there for a reason. Bombers have very specific role and suck at everything else so does black ops, prober or blockade runner. Don't fix what ain't broken.
---
The Permit Patty Patrol really only goes after easy kills. Stay away from bottle back systems like Niarja. Find an area of Highsec that is relatively quiet and mine to your hearts content.
---
I can't really go into nullsec as a solo player, right?  So I should find a corp to join?
---
 I expect no less than 2 million skill points on each account for the mental anguish suffered during this time.
---
For the love of god, please don’t be Global

they drive on salt so dont intact with them and get a new ship. if they gank you in catalysts than you allready won the isk war.
---
You look up into the sky and see a massive warship, firing upon any and every vessel entering. Before you know it, you are dead, except this is real life so you don't have a clone to transport your consciousness back to
---
do you remember when you were all "ooohhh i think i understand now" on what was it? talking in stations?
---
that was my "oh he knows precisely what he did" moment.
---
but here we are. i wonder what you thought you did that justified the ban.
---
I didn't read their webpage because I do not negotiate with terrorists.  But I suppose reading their ideas would help counter them.
---
It should be no more the 2 jumps away, though usually it's 0-1. Burner mission can send you up to 5 away though if I remember correctly.
---
Stop mining afk. Stop mining altogether tbh, it's shit isk and mind numbing as fuck. 
---
By the way, the reason they send those mails is to collect tears. So by responding in a butthurt way like you did, you gave them exactly what they wanted lmao. 
---
Also, permits are honored. If you must live in the shithole that is highsec, I highly recommend purchasing one from a friendly agent near you and following the CODE.
---
"You responded correctly" Yes indeed. The tearmails are the primary reason I gank.
---
https://youtu.be/GBvfiCdk-jc?t=135
---
I'm not a PR guy but probably should make sure you are right enough before posting a ban and chest beating.
---
I don't have a high opinion of the way the csm is elected. I don't have a high trust in their ability to consistenrly offer healthy feedback to CCP on matters that involves a clash of interests between empire building and other playstyles. But most cases are not like that, even CSMs I think to be bad offer good feedback in most cases, some CSM are even better than others, and the game is still better off with CSM as a focus group. Don't let my rumblings about A few really important issues lead you to think that I think game would have been better off without CSM.
---
Once they have blown you up, go back and loot their wreck, profit, rinse repeat.
---
CCP on their A game lately.
---
Fuck me what a clusterfuck of fuckups
---
Holy shit what kind of software requires 20 minutes of setup to do the same job over and over again jesus
---
I have to admit there's a certain perverse entertainment value for me in this.
---
For years, hundreds of EVE players were convinced that I somehow used my position on the CSM to personally ban Erotica 1. I'll bet a person or two reading this still believes it today, and it still gets thrown in my face from time to time. That accusation at the time was absurdly misplaced and wrong-headed, proven wrong by facts that were publicly available, and flew in the face of these very same people usually believing that the CSM has no influence on CCP at all.
---
This time, someone or someones on the CSM very definitely got pretty much the entire leadership team of an entire alliance banned, including a popular CSM member. This is something that a public statement from CCP (now deleted) definitely states factually did happen.
---
But this time, everyone seems to be all "Well, what are you gonna do? Goons gonna Goon. It's just meta-gaming." about it. And the whole story is likely to be forgotten by everyone not involved in six months or a year.
---
Like I said, there's a perverse entertainment value for me in that.
---
\*standing ovation\* Hats off to CCP for demonstrating the integrity to investigate and own up to a mistake. A lesser company would have never admitted fault like this.
---
Considering most wormholers would rather CCP not touch it and break shit, idk fam seems like I struck a nerve there
---
This is literally the only way for news outlets to survive today.
---
Procurer, that's all I am saying. Don't be that greedy guy in the Retriever with a target on him.
---
My brain hurts
---
I would recommend it,  you can pvp roam nullsec by yourself or do pirate missions, but eve is a social game. There are plenty of new player-friendly corps in nullsec, the largest being KarmaFleet, Brave Newbies, and Pandemic Horde Inc.
---
Is eve university still functioning?

Well done on the reply part, you'll fit right in. Some gankers naively believe that every reply is salty - even when it's just laughter at their cost. Most don't. True salt is only supplied without begging for it in any form of a letter or chatter in local.
---
I might do a sequel on the existent counters to Boosh Ravens if people are interested, but the short list from my perspective of hard counters are; LR Dreads, Distributed Carriers, ChemoLokis, Slippery Steves.
---
Ravens can 1v1 other Ravens, but w/o your own CDs you're not going to be able to chase them off any objectives.
---
Wait, so what we're in those logs that he seemed so proud about?
---
It's probably counter productive of me to say this, but I suspect most of the people on either side of the argument were blinded by political affiliations both inside and outside of the game.
---
I think we should go back to escaping from the real world bullshit and back to sharing our love for this broken game while not trusting anything from CCP.
---
fit shield extenders and invulnerability fields, pay attention in local, keep mining. Adding CODE to your contacts with a -10 standing might help you spot them earlier. Doesn't help for any out-of-corp characters they use.
---
If you see them in local, keep mining, be ready to warp out. Learning to use the dscan tool will help.

When you upgrade, get the procurer as it has a far better tank.

Pandemic Horde runs a 10% tax, same as npc corp. And mining aren't taxed.
---
You can't do a 150km ping, it has to be offgrid. You should also be using either a Magus (for the bonused sig link) or the Proteus (for both the bonused sig link and the less suspicious ship on dscan).
---
Fuck off. Glad that CCP got it right, but I won't apologize for trusting them.

Still should be banned anyway, given he's lobbyist filth. Subhuman scum.

I mean thats an exaggeration but it does bring in questions on what exactly CCP policy is regarding bans. How much evidence is enough? What evidence was used in this case? Who makes the call? 
---
One thing I hope we don't see is more people trying to metagame CCP, because it's starting to look like that's what happened here.
---
Nulli-Cloaky-Blaster Proteus that Provi used to counter the doctrine when it was being used en-masse against us. Warp them in at 0, decloak, scram CDs and start firing.
---
Well as a subcap doctrine trying to defend yourself against them - Not well as structure defence as the Raven fleet can move around the structure faster/as fast as you, but does not need to be positioned as precisely.
---
On mobile, so I can't reach Pyfa ATM.  Will share my fits later if I remember.
---
You can bolt a 50mn MWD to a Crusader for 8-9 km/s, but all your lows go to APCs and RCUs, and you'll never be cap stable.
---
It works out better if you use a Punisher instead.  You don't need all your lows for PG, so you can reach cap stability at 6-7 km/s.  Then add overclocker,  Quafe, heat, HG snakes and nav implants and you can reach somewhere around 11-12 km/s.
---
I vaguely recall, anyway; maybe you need more lows for cap stability and won't have any to spare for speed.
---
i can't recall the wording of the old post by ccp
---
did someone actually accuse you or could it have been "hey we were just told about this thing and the prices spiked afterwards, might want to go look into who's buying them"

If I'd be in the mood I could livestream my corp roams with just my laptop and a built-in webcam, yet CCP cannot stream something like this? Hello?
---
Also thank you Jin for doing your best.
---
Use your inherent warp core bonus on your venture to warp out after they redbox. Then they lose their ship but don't get a kill. Make sure to type gf in local.
---
In Eve? I wish :(
---
Round 2 of dissapointment incomming for jin
---
I think free skill points are in order.
---
That's because I believe that the real objective for WinterCo was to bait out a fight, which they did successfully.
---
No nerfs are needed.  It takes skill and very good coordination to work a Boosh-Raven fleet.   It should take the same amount of skill and coordination to defeat it.  I myself know a number of ways.  Munins and Eagles main core will trash Boosh-Raven fleet as long as it has smart support tackle independent flying pilots and scanner support.  Also Sniper Harpies and or jaguar will eat them too if you have the numbers and support to give good warping.
---
Excuse me? Did you just call wormholers weirdos? **Bruh...**

Wouldn't Raven v Raven run into big issues when it comes to missile travel time, since chain booshing will result in the ships moving significantly while the missiles are already in the air? After all cruise missiles are really slow.

As Jin stated, it's about producing a quality show for the duration of the matches.The way the tool is working there would be 20 mins of dead time between each match, when you times this by the number of matches it adds up to a significant amount for one evening. Therefore the matches will be recorded and overplayed with commentators for release slightly after the event.

---
Because an NDA breach accusation is very different than "you got caught RMTing or botting lol", which I assume is the majority of bans. Maybe also real-life threats, doxxing, and abusive language, but otherwise, those things are small stuff.
---
NDA is an actual contract violation that needs to be able to be proven in the court of law.   
---
Just breaking EULA does not break a law.
---
In fact, you don't even need to break EULA to get banned. If CCP just doesn't like you, they have all right to ban you from their property without any explanation or reimbursement.  
---
Not that they tend to do this randomly or for no reason.
---
Even with that Brisc false accusation, they THOUGHT they had evidence, and then after further investigation it clearly didn't hold up, so they reverted their decision. But I'm sure that the initial investigation produced results that caused the ban and the statement.  
---
Now you can be unreasonable and expect CCP to put a personal investigator on every single RMTer and botter that gets reported to verify it just like they did with Brisc. But I think you know that isn't feasible. Plus even THEN people will complain because it will take too long to ban people, and that botters ruin the economy and should be banned that exact second they get reported.
---
They owe us all 1m SP

The CSM has been a joke for ages. Its been basically nothing but a chance for null blocs to make themselves even richer/more powerful. 
---
At the barest minimum CCP should change its name to something more reflective of its purpose. Something like "Null Advocacy Board" or "Make my RMT ticks go up CCP".

It's a pic of Brisc.  He's right there in the rings.

I still believe on what I said, what happened today was just CCP backing down, so meh.
---
To be fair, who would want CYNOU members in Snigg?  its like a weeb containment zone.
---
And we learned a valuable lesson about tribalism and assumptions without evidence. This entire time I said you can't assume guilt (or innocence really) without evidence and Reddit was sharpening the pitchforks and downvoting. I understand trusting CCP and suspicion of people crying "honest guvnah!" But theres a reason justice systems presume innocence until guilt is proven and don't admit circumstantial evidence.
---
Fair enough, I just believe that many would still be happy to watch those matches, even with 20 minutes of nothing between every two matches.
---
Guess we need an elected group of players to oversee the CSM.

amen bother

did CCP mess up here? probably. but the idea of comparing ingame activity to IRL situations that need to be proven in court is just a very big set of logical fallacies...
---
&gt; Do you have to release your real name to be on the CSM?

I'm pretty sure I remember casting a vote one year, and every portrait had the in-game and real-life names under it.

And this younglings is what we call "damage control"
---
It's times like this when I really miss /u/Cymek
---
Don’t forget the yaw.
---
There are plenty of counter measures (most of which you have mentioned) to the Raven fleet which already makes it a very risky doctrine to use. Asking for more 'nerfs' to its effectiveness when there are already so many counters seems a bit unnecessary.
---
There is more than just reddit, yes most of reddit was happy most of the GSF controlled allied media was unhappy.  
---
This means despite the reddit cheers CCP was very much perceived as biased something that is more harmful than a bad decision to there long term health ( and what the CSM was created to mitigate ) 
---
I mean it's clearly speculation as well "my money would be on" kind of points out in the first place, given it's a rather trivial breach and well something that would mean somebody csm that's not brisc would be made aware it seems like a reasonable gamble, yes that could be totally wrong.
---
Congrats. Good for you for taking the high road.
---
Playing EVE solo is not really best way to play at least when new. You need veteran players to teach you the tricks to survive. 
---
And venture mining in highsec can be worse isk than what you pay for your electricity running your computer. You can earn maybe max 10mil for 1 hour of mining. For example if you buy a plex from CCP for 14 dollars you can sell it for about 2,2bil isk. That's 220 hours of venture mining in highsec.
---
IMO as a new player you should concentrate on doing more fun stuff than mining. It works better as a group activity.
---
I don't even play Eve dude but congrats on getting justice.

Wasn't Slippery Steve name for hard-to-probe rail tengus used from 100+ km ranges? Or was it Slippery Pete?
---
They made a mistake, now they’re fixing it and apologizing.
---
This is the correct course of action.
---
Not the mistake part, just the owning up to it part.
---
Another happy ending.

&gt;As far as a loki goes, one web is usually not enough to hold a 100mn cruiser, and have you tried to fit dual webs on a nullified loki and still tank? Aside form that since when did you need to scram something to hold it down? A decently tanked VNI can survive on grid long enough for friends to arrive, and if you aren't relying on the VNI itself for a cyno then it should be able to tackle a loki long enough for a ceptor and cyno to arrive as well. 
---
Right, because lokis are always alone, and nobody would ever bring two of them at once. And you do need scram to hold something down, otherwise it just mwds away and then warps off. A loki is faster than a VNI, since you can't really fit dualprop, tank, and neuts with an overprop ab, and a bling loki will be able to web a VNI from outside of point range anyway.
---
&gt;Another thing to consider here is what is the goal of the roaming fleet. Is it to gank VNIs or is it to get a fight?
---
Different fleets have different goals. Some people would have the goal of killing all the VNIs. Others wouldn't, but these others wouldn't have any targets because of the first group.
---
As for your proposal for anoms with lots of tackle and anti-cap stuff. The latter is what makes the VNI so good, the big guns can't track an overprop ab cruiser, and it has the heavy drones to punch well above its weight. And I don't think tackle belongs in anoms, really. If you don't mess up, you shouldn't die. That's true for pretty much all isk making in eve, except abyssals or wormholes. In known space, you should be able to play safe and survive if you're attentive. And why do you want people in a BS, anyway? Its not like a cheap BS is that much more costly than a VNI, just more skill intensive, and putting an even higher sp barrier on getting started ratting isn't a good thing. You're not going to push people into rattles, it'll be t1 battleships, or more likely, battlecruisers. Capital ratting is already getting to be not worth it with anom, NSA, and fighter nerfs, from what i've seen. 
---
&gt;Well, miners and abyssal runners are also great targets in NS, and while you would likely see an uptic in exploration, a significant increase would drive down salvage prices. It would also mean more competition for the same sites, as the number of explorers a region can support is an order of magnitude smaller then the number of ratters it can. Abyssal prices might also crash if you saw that many more people running abyssal sites. A big difference here is that people are moving from generating ISK, to generating items that are sold for ISK.
---
Yes, which is why I find it suspicious that you, and the other wormholers who propose these things, don't propose anything to nerf the blue loot drops to wormholes. You're trying to make nullsec isk generation impossible, and then keep your own income stream constant. Everyone else is going to be deflating the value of materials, either abyssal, salvage, or minerals, and you will just sit on top of the only isk generator not to be touched, besides incursions.
---
&gt;It's not like people have stopped ratting because local broke in the past
---
Because everyone knew that if they died, they could ticket it and get the ship back. When you drop the cost of a VNI from 100 mil to 30 (even less if you manage to recall your drones and they don't drop), then suddenly ratting without local seem worth the risk.
---
&gt;It's not like all of the NS ratters could just move to HS incursions.
---
So, if they can't rat without making either terrible or negative ticks, can't make any decent isk while exploring/mining/abyssaling, do you think they're going to stick around? I guarantee that not only would a majority of them try to move to other ways of making isk, quite a few would just quit.
---
He said himself on TIS that there had been conversations with the CSM at the summit over their concerns regarding something he said to one of his alliance members.
---
just tank your ship lmao
---
I upgraded from Resto Druid to Oneiros and never came back.
---
he runs security, there is no way in hell he wasn't consulted before this went through
---
nah
---
ya
---
both groups can have way too many in them, hth
---
&gt; to which I curtly replied 
---
Mistake there.  You are just stoking their fires.
---
The best way to disarm someone verbally, is to agree with them.  Making them laugh is master-class.

There are tons of systems that are completely empty.

I was mining Arkonor in a 0.5 recently using a Venture.  They spotted me jumping their moon claim, and I got invited to join their corp.

---
Nothing happened. CCP said they assumed something had happened but it didn't. I will concede that the CSM member may not have accused Brisc of cheating and had a concern. However, I would not want to vote for someone that would not have the courage of their convictions to challenge me to my face if something didn't look good.
---
&gt;Blue scouting is totally different thing, again
---
how is blue scouting or neutral scouting different?
---
&gt;Talos does 1500-2000dps, dread does 15000-20000 dps.
---
and yet is enough to kill anything in 60 seconds if you undock enough
---
&gt;Maybe?
---
factually, as you can't link me a single thing in tyool 2019 that was ganked while wardeccers were fighting it by alts of wardeccers
---
&gt;Then nobody cares about highsec wardecs and it doesn't matter what you do. If they do care then they will hire mercs to kill the citadels.
---
they are the mercs
---
&gt;Killing random structures in highsec without any reason is waste of time.
---
yet another problem with citadel warfare
---
Then it could be poor judgement. Neither is the greatest trait and both would impact on how people vote.
---
Best line in this thread by like a factor of 900000 trillions.

It looks more like "work", so when I'm browsing at work it's less suspicious than the dark background.
---
There's even a reddit "skin" that makes it look like a spreadsheet, but that annoys me to look at, and there's no way people are gonna believe I'm looking at spreadsheets all day.
---
No fuck you all my replies were right no matter what these mouth breathers think.
---
Cancer Judy's were the optimal counter to boosh ravens.
---
that is implying he was relevant enough at one time to actually fade away.
---
Well obviously there was something that CCP had to go on to make them act that certainly.
---
Sorry, I can be an asshole sometimes. Hahaha
---
then remove gates. and cynos. and local. don’t half-ass it, go for the full ass.
---
There is a Tama near Tokyo too.
---
In Eve, assume both.
---
Because your question is weird and I'm an asshole sometimes.
---
Gone are the days I had twitchy reflexes and good aim
---
&gt; Another happy ending.
---
I don't think that means what you think it means.
---
BFG ratting is actually quite chill bro
---
hey I understood that reference!
---
Why do you constantly bring up US politics in the EVE subreddit?
---
FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
LOL have you been waiting 2 weeks to reply to this?? We don't know that he is "totally innocent" and was "100% right". All we know is CCP is doing a reversal from their initial claims. He could still be "totally guilty" and "100% wrong" but purely speculation and don't want to get into a legal battle. MOST LIKELY this was driven by CCPs lawyers.
---
Maybe we need to have the two cities have a battle royal for the right to the name.

---
Since you were kind enough to [link my post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bazjd6/official_statement_of_brisc_rubal_on_removal_and/ekfbbiy/), I'll offer a comment explaining myself.
---
You will notice that absolutely nowhere in my post do I actually say 'zomg brisc is guilty' or the like. That is not accidental. At the time I posted that we had nothing but competing assertions from the two sides, and not a shred of actual evidence either way. I'm not going to draw a conclusion in such a case, and I did not do so in that post.
---
All I talked about was how I felt about *brisc's statement*, and I stand 100% by everything I said in that regard. It *was* a thoroughly smarmy politician-ese deflection-cum-attack-statement that would have been completely at home coming from the desk of the guiltiest scumbag-politician-caught-in-a-scandal ever, and bragging of positions in *united states politics* (note: regardless of specific political affiliation) as evidence of *trustworthiness* is still the most laughable thing I've heard in months
---
I will make no apology for concluding that such statements made him sound absolutely untrustworthy. What I said in that post, and my feelings about the matter as a result, have absolutely nothing to do with anything CCP did or brisc's actual guilt or innocence, and everything to do with how brisc responded to it. You can't blame *that* part on CCP.
---
A lot
---
I wouldn't be surprised if this all boils down to CSM members telling CCP something fishy might be going on, CCP taking that as evidence something *was* going on, and using their jump to conclusions mat.
---
If nothing else in this game I've learned just how *easily* miscommunication - in game, AND IRL - can cause the most disastrous things to happen.
---
My issue with all of this is that you have a large enough persona both in game and out to have had a chance to call CCP accountable for due process. If this had been anyone else on the CSM, it would have ended on that day, and exoneration would have never happened.
---
This bot is like an annoying always barking for no reason Chihuahua
---
That’s a lot of sarcasm....
---
&gt;so we've wittled down 90% of your points
---
Except we didn't.
---
&gt;you have a really bad understanding of eve my friend
---
You too.
---
Nowhere in the world elections with 10% turnout would have been called a democracy.
---
They have joined Goonswarm Federation and Pandemic Legion in the 1 million club. Next up looks to be NCdotto who are currently sitting at 820k kills.
---
hahahah yeaahhhh there yyou goo!!! hold face man.. that'll prove more of an actual ass hat you are.
---
&gt;I've been doing a lot of exploration lately, but I seem to find myself dead quite a bit. I know the best way into those sweet nullsec exploration sites is through wormholes, but how can I move around Nullsec without getting ganked? What's the best way to move from one null system to another without hitting some sort of warp disruption bubble? Once I enter a system, do I just need to warp to a planet that is not in the path of the stargate I intend to exit from, before warping to the gate at 100km?
---
In addition to what has already been said, you can also make book marks while actually mid warp and use them later. If you make a pair of them, then warp between them and set a 3rd, then you will have a very good chance that 3rd bookmark will never be on any path to anything in the entire system. If its a place you visit often then you might want to save bookmarks like this.
---
Those are Slippery Petes
---
First asociation is gate camp.
---
I know, I'm super dissapointed tbh. I thought CCP were better than this :(
---
Miner, are you botting?
---
Hi friend, please do not link directly to botting resources. We have rules that go in line with CCP's Eula. You can discuss this sort of thing just fine, just don't directly link people to it. 
---
 I do see the point you were trying to make so use this comment as 'proof' for your argument. You definitely linked a bunch of botting tutorials that mango's use.
---
YEAH! Having lived in a wormhole before... you fuckers that choose that life are weirder than weirdos.
---
&gt;They won't want to if a ban is gonna legally bite them back for IRL damages
---
A ban can never legally bite them for IRL damages. The way the EULA is phrased there will never been any IRL damages due to a ban.
---
What had the potential to legally bite them was the claim of an NDA breach. Falsely claiming someone broke an NDA can result in damages.
---
CCP could have rolled back the claims about the NDA, but kept the ban. CCP would have no liability in that case.
---
It's actually more complicated than I'm letting on, but that's the gist of it. You won't win any damages against CCP for a ban. You might win damages if they falsely accuse you of breaching an NDA.
---
*Brisc Rubal wants to know your location*
---
You posted in a thread with 807 other comments. Sometimes the ball just doesn't get rolling.
---
Five bucks this guy hasn't actually met him for more than ten seconds.  Doom is pretty dope
---
Nah, they all accused him. Conspiracy
---
Why tho?
---
Have you not seen the absolute shitshow that's been CCP for like 3+ years now.
---
Indubitably
---
There was no collusion no obstruction. It’s been a witch hunt the whole time.
---
I had a 4 year break from eve until September last year. In 2013-2014 CCP were doing very well at listening to community concerns and making positive changes.
---
The irl politics is for real too
---
Just fyi
---
&gt; can ceptor burn me a perch
---
Hold my beer
---
ok.. but court in what country? also, maybe it went/goes to court - do you think any court system would decide in favor of a plaintiff/case like this? how would they even prove libel/slander? those kinds of things are hard to prove and often require the plaintiff to be able to prove IRL damages (like loss of money, etc)
---
i like flying the boosts drake...its my new platform.
---
or logibro (I think that's logibro?)
---
Now would be the best time to ~~start~~ continue your campaign.
---
It would mean 3x longer for the competitors and organisers as well however.

Remember that if you learn how to become good at damage role you will become better support pilot also.

Oh boy, we're entering a new age of EVE Online here on TQ. :popcorn:

High Slot -  concord Rapid Response Cyno.

Hit it 10 seconds later concord jumps on you.
---
wow you've given up on ALL of your points
---
see you next time with your half baked ideas
---
haha yeah, just imagine
---
Is there a way to get a hold of the NPE dev team? I really feel like making some suggestions on showing players how the market tab functions. Been helping a few days on the Rookie Help channel and whenever somebody runs out of ammo or gets their ship blown up, this seems to be the biggest hurdle for the new player, just figuring out how to buy their stuff they need back, or even how to sell their stuff.
---
If CCP bans some high profile player it's very bad to not to give a reason. Depending on the ban reason people can still claim false accusations and damages with or without the nda. For example, if gigx was a high profile politician, and got banned due to alleged irl threats, that could damage his career. And if evidence available for the occurrence of that irl threat was as partial as potential evidence for briscs insider trading, then gigx could have claimed damages due to false accusation. So no you don't need an nda relationship to claim damages from a ban.
---
Absurd amount of estimated is earned
---
Should we
---
A) Panic 
---
B) Call out CCP for their incompetence of stop botting
---
C) 1986 Tiananmen
---
D) Irrealistic game balance proposals

Mind u, u can go REALLY fast on special bumps, like cyno dies and u spawn inside the sun for example, you will be going very very fast for days.
---
However I thought the more common ships were also a lot less advanced since they lost so much tech in the last couple thousand years.
---
idk why anyone would side with CCP when bans are being discussed lmao
---
Why watch ships fight when you can watch random rorqual streamer #2953495734!!!!!!!!
---
You...you want to catch up for dinner sometime?
---
Drake. The can I bring my Drake meme and all the nerfs that it received makes people think it’s bad, but really it’s awesome in either a HM kiting fit or a HAM brawl fit.
---
Arbitrator. Not necessarily seen as bad, but rarely used. It’s great in a kiting set up or as a brawler with an XLASB.
---
&gt;but I won't apologize for trusting them.
---
generally you apologize for following an incorrect assumption
---
Stay classy, Brisc. You had your name dragged through the mud and you don't even seem mad. Most people would be out for blood and salty af. I hope you can still enjoy your hobby after all this bs.
---
I always tell myself EVE is a game which your screen size is one of the huge win-conditions
---
&gt;Man, if CCP could fuck up this bad with a member of the CSM, imagine all the random nobodies who get falsely banned with no viable recourse...
---
haha yeah, we only have to imagine
---
it's not like i can think of a dozen banned-unbanned fuckups CCP has done, and a couple totally horseshit ones
---
And this is why you wait for evidence to come out. I'm always willing to let the accused be proven innocent before truly solidifying my opinion. Seemed a bit out of character for someone willing to put so much on the line for the game. Just glad this got cleared up.
---
&gt; I mean, they could have not apologized for it and continued down the previous path.
---
you mean the status quo
---
For what, child porn?
---
RES I think works well with it.
---
But can't they ban him again for being such a massive douche of bag?
---
Right, fuck the guy for trying to clear his name in the best way he knows how.
---
These non-apologies just show how shitty of a human garbage bag you are and the same goes for anyone else who leaves one.
---
Own up to your mistake and quit being a giant bitch.
---
It's so easy to say "We don't discuss private matters publicly." It wouldn't be the first time for CCP either. Manny was kicked off the CSM, and CCP never gave a reason.
