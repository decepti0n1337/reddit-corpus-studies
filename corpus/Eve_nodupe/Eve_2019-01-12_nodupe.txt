putting up a ''market hub'' just ensures you get good loot on top of the KM if you shoot it.
---
every half decent wh-group has their own stocked market. or jita alts/neutral haulers. there is simply no need for it.
---
aside from that, the chances connecting to your hub are next to zero..

Why can't you move your own cyno FC?
---
You get access to better missions by increasing your relevant standing with the mission giver (aka agent). You do this by doing missions for that Agent’s corporation or faction, or for an allied corporation or faction.

Look for the Eve Uni page on missions and standings for more info.

Hey guys been running Strictly Electrical Abyssals in Gila Working threw the levels earning some cash for some of the fits i see , been running L3 Electricals and im curious i see most the fits run inferno which is fine, but on the drones they carry hammerheads and vespas, i see in eft the hams are more raw dps but im curious when im supposed to use the vespas and if either of them are even the best chest for strictly electricals. Share your insight guys !!
---
FEDUP? moar liek FUCKUP  
---
ayyyyyy zinger
---
He's been there for years in all four cosmos, alarm clocking the respawns. The problem is the pisspoor design of the pve which encourages it rather than anything one can draw wider conclusions from but yeah, it's pretty bad. 
---
Lowering the cooldown time years after the jump fatigue introduction would be hilarious to watch.
---
The biggest reason to not say "this is useless, use this instead" is because the information to displayed in two different ways that appeal to two very different people. So you dislike the graph and prefer a table. The person above you is the opposite. Do you see it's usefulness now?
---
Here is an example:
---
"I need the longest range ammo for my lasers"
---
On the table you would see Radio first, then have to compare all other numbers to it.
---
Graph you just look for the furthest right dot.
---
What a bunch of pussies.

This is 100% the corp CEO/Directors problem. If this conversation happens, those people are failing their corporation as leaders and hurting the alliance at the same time.  
---
  
---
It's just too damn easy to spend a little time with a member what doctrines they have ready/can fly and what to bring if they aren't there yet. And you don't even have to do it for every member each time, just setup a damn google doc and link it to them so they can just come to you with questions.  
---
Anyway, this was your PSA on how to help un-shit fleet comms, at least on this topic...
---
Toby must be pleased
---
Sorry thats what I meant you have been a director for ages!
---
Then you switch over and no fight happens at all. 
---
Go finish the abortion your father should of started.
---
happened twice that i called a fleet as finished before it even started. everything was ready. hostile fleet in position, caps fueled and ready to go in. bait subcaps in position next door to go in and start the skirmish. i ask for cyno alts (per rule everyone must have cyno toons located nearby and i simply couldnt since all of my 9 accounts were in use with scouts, scanners or simply in dreads) and suddenly voice comms are dead. after 10 minutes asking for a cyno alt, i declared the fleet as over. suddenly people came with "chill bro i can login my alt". didnt accept it. next time, i had plenty of cynos. i am fc, not a fkn entertainer that holds hand so people can easy go in and out for kills. in eve i demand people to be useful. who isnt usefull is a burden and so for more usefull as a tarfet to shoot at.
---
FEDUP is hardly an old alliance lol
---
lol tishu flairbait
---
I heard they just lost a titan as well to the powerful snuffed out alliance. Sad to see them fall so low 
---
Thera.
---
We have their titan tackled! loooooooooooooooool
---
&gt;unless theyre rocket fit
---
I'm not so sure that that's generally true that you can out-DPS a rocket bote with Barrage. Maybe against a Breacher, Kestrel, *maybe* a Hookbill (I can't into the Hookbill unfortunately, and am presently too lazy to trawl zkill for good fits) that's the case, but against something like a Hawk, Vengeance, or the ever present Jaguar it most definitely isn't.
---
Or, well, I suppose more correctly if a rocket hull decides to facebrawl at zero you can probably out-DPS them, but it's very unlikely that that will happen and if they do scramkite you then it's 50/50 whether or not you can actually trade with them with Barrage.
---
Also  I could have sworn that the Wolf could pretty easily go \~3 km/s cold even in a plate+AAR fit, considering just how stupid fast it zips around on dual nanos.
---
Use whatever drone damage type the filament you run gives a penalty to and you are golden.

,last one i got  was a brokkara river,no fucking officer mods at all...ty ccp for fucking up ma belts
---
You could do missile launchers, the ammo itself is pretty consistent but the launchers could be separated in terms of base missile explosion velocity/area from a set point of skill level (3 or above I would think.)  Then a standard ammo type, one faction and the t2's. Ship selection would be interesting, Of course this graph might be a little much from the start but it's just a idea.  Great work!

If you dont put your drones on targets as logistics idk what game you're playing.
---
Don’t die. Very simple
---
still a nice game. dont think it was better. plenty of stuff changed but that is a personal question depending if people like the changes. i do like most of the changes tbh. i also do like most stuff ccp is doing. i mean we are all giving them shit since 2003 because ccplease, but tbh compared to other devs they are really into improving. sometimes they do dumb shit and fuck up f.e. with fkn broken local holy shit fml that's bad shit. but most of the time they are open for discussions, test a lot, work a lot and still work hard on improving the game. 
---
beside that i agree the dude above me except that i honestly think it is not p2w. in my experience the more RL isk you spent the more you lose. it is all about knowledge abd experience. everything including skillpoints can be made ingame by simply making ingame money (what is super easy if you know how to)

They are/were content

indeed it is. I'd wager that once they went into null and started bulking up that mass ended up being spod suckers, and while for sure the siege of eha offered a reprieve from that lifestyle it might've been too little, given that half the video was silver talking about how much money they made and how they will be able to make even more money now! and keepstars! 
---
Left thankfully 
---
And it's unironically groups like Snuff doing it. FW is the place you go for small-mid size fleet content and they snuffed it out, literally.
---
NJED?
---
i also love structure harbi with dual web mwd disruptor. decent tank decent speed good range and nice tracking. solid 92k ehp with around 600 dps. you want to have a tackle tho because it is still a BC but good stats for cheap money.
---
Cheerzah brav. Much love from the okkamon pirate.

Well, fedup decleared a holy war against pen is out if im not mistaken and 3 weeks later they are done and gone. They will do the holy war from afar then ,i guess.
---
but is this 100% accurate with augmented hams doing 100 more raw dps then augmented infiltrators?

&gt;But we're moving for good content as always.

Don't use implants. There, I fixed it.

But seriously, learning implants (and attributes) need to go away. They don't add anything.

Downvote if you want, but you're doing it wrong in a TiDi fight if you have combat drones and are trying to max-rep your DPS while manage primary targets that get deleted instantly. Clearly you are a small gang logi bruh.

CCP needs to get around to ACTUALLY MAKING GOOD ON ADDING LOGI AND EWAR TO KILLMAILS/BRs and maybe Logi would be so KM-whorish.

At least the WANGS limo has a tank fit.
---
We're still here and still (ir)relevant.
---
The idea is you send a drone to every one you rep thus whoring on the kills of all the blues when they all panic broadcast and reps get split
---
TBH this is mostly true. Basically they created an anti snuff coalition with iron armada, fedup, and free range chikuns. Then they decided they wanted war with WANGS as well. Obviously they made a mistake.

different studio teams work on different subjects of the game. you have art team, bug smashers, content devs and so on. the persons are educated (lol i hope) in their specific field. you cant put down an artist to the programmers and a programmer will mostlikely create shitty skins whatsoever. anyway, i totally agree on the message and holy shit, ccplease fix dat shit. but i think that dropping other projects wouldnt mean that ccps gets their stuff fixed earlier.

obviously this is only the case if they dont accidently put new stuff in that breaks the game more but with my limited knowledge i cant see how a new abysyal pocket or a new skin could fuck up this shitty local even more :P

Nope I didnt, thanks for mentioning it. I will try tonight. If I can dump my implants and augments that would be great. I'm not to fussed about skipping travel time. 
---
most of my years i played with 3-7 people. we made billions and made so many fucktards cry in local. 
---
all of us are multiboxers what helps a lot.
---
but even if i run around with my toons alone (in pvp i do max 5 toons on grid) i am already able to at least fuck with smaller corps. you cant imagine how much damage you can deal when you focus on guerilla engagements. even bigger alliances will simply hate you because it id super hard to really do anything againdt dedicated assholes :P

Cheerzah but don’t forget. Retribution is conking your way salt farmer

you might be getting it confused with magna digitus(?), the only spaceship bebop ex corp in fedup is XMETA which left spaceship bebop way before it folded

Trying to push the renter angle to them joining legacy is your projection. They are joining as a member alliance, as you well know.
---
I'm sorry to let you know ur alone, eve doesn' t have sound. 
---
and only in rocket League. everywhere else this might be dangerous and could danger your health. and since we care about our fellow autists we need you to take care of yourself, you fkn cnt.
---
Here's my 2 isk.... Fedup could've been great, but then they became farmers. Taking losses completely demoralized them. Take WANGS as an alternate example, we lost a fort to init titans and we were in good spirits laughing about it, fedup lost a fort to snuff titans and all they did was whine, and if init pushes WANGS further and evicts us we'll just go to lowsec and keep shooting them, cause we care more about pvping than making isk. Fedup liked to fight (against WANGS) over cloud ring while WANG numbers weren't great (while we were getting everyone to deploy) and I fed fleets night after night to them for fights; then when the numbers evened out they stopped bringing fights and just flew jackdaws.

How about missile application chart vs 130 m sig cruiser going 250m/s (i think these values are pretty average for t1 cruiser)

Yes, use faction drones that match the resist profiles for best performance 
---
Yeh that was a good stream. Trying YouTube stuff sometimes
---
I wish
---
mecha enterprises was ex-bebop
---
which is kinda weird because odds are they'd be able to rely on almost the entirety of galmil *and* calmil to help them against snuff, i'd bet even other pirates from the black rise area would want to join in.
---
Love the love on my streams. Soprah comes in and makes me laugh trying to an enemy but always come off as a person who wants to be alpha like sheltark

VNI ratting earns you 3x more isk than moon mining? Either you're mining some incredibly shit moons or using a venture.

Good luck with your move and enjoy the new adventure.

Granted this is not A blog, but anything well written is more than welcome
---
Sad to see FEDUP won't be around in Fountain but glad to see FEDUP will be a member alliance where they ended up.
---
Shouldn't scorch be higher than conflag on the tracking axis, as its a .75x penalty to the .7x penalty you get for conflag?
---
sure would help some people, i did this, and it was a struggle without many solid guides on making isk in today's game
---
Would be a bit more than a blog conversation would be had in great detail on different ways of doing so and having those that have share their experience
---
You're confusing FEDUP with WANGS. Both came from galmil, but snuff never liked us.
---
Can confirm this bug - it's happened to me a bunch of times, and I'd like to think its caused several botting VNI's just enough time to align out and warp.

hmmm i thought bebop had died in 2016, oops my mistake
---
Wangs is Snuff, you were snuff pets.
---
This is the correct answer, What it forgets is that while the POS needs fuel for RF timer, it always has Shields, So the main complaint about abandoned towers didnt get any better with Citadels. 
---
Namely that abandoned towers were boring and stupid to grind down even while undefended. The tower spam problem was a problem because of offline towers having the same base resists and shields that powered ones did even though they werent fueled. 
---
Add the Asset safety and there is even less of a reason to grind abandoned citadels anywhere outside of WH space. 
---
nah, snuff has been shooting us since they day we formed. that's why we even temp blued with calmil to fight snuff on several occasions.
---
He can have a biscuit.
---
Jesus loves you
---
Then go for it. Put down a keepstar. 
---
Who?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Snuffed is gay.
---
Don't mind him, he's just a few levels lower on the sodium meter then Mikal.
---
I meant in the capacity of opposing snuff, i'd assume snuff's offensive wouldn't be in USTZ and you'd be surprised how many nerds from UF/HECON you would be able to get if you told them snuff was in the plate, hell if you had a WH available odds are templis would come as well in some capacity, remember that at that point EU calmil was on the edge of PB in tartoken. Now wheter or not those would make a sizeable difference is another matter, but for sure would be something to add, can't say much about the galmil forces but at least we would be able to laugh at people having to hold themselves to not kill roy. Why fedup decided to go against rdraw from a strategic perspective however is the real head scratcher.
---
There's a difference between TEST renter space and Legacy alliances. FEDUP will be sov holders and a new Legacy alliance afaik. Legacy does mutual ops with TEST and other coalition alliances and defends their space. They won't pay for any of it.  
---
AAR? 
---
Proximity to a stargate is a coincidence hopefully?
---
Def not renters they dont pay for the space. I dont know if they are more than that

At best the 3 competent people in FEEDUP will get poached and then it will be thrown into the trash.

They will always find content, its always been the major driver of what made fedup so great. I still remember the warzone fights, so much good shit. The guys running it are toptier dudes and the members all have eachothers backs and a sense of comradarie.

Templis came for the big fight in PB where snuff rattles were waterboarded but other than that I think fedup relied on goon allies more.

Probably cause a SNUFF fleet only shot CalSF once while you were here. Not very many opportunities to suffer shenanigans.

Last week we pulled our first Level II Mission of Mercy in the Tristans and it was a slaughter-fest.  A lot of smoking hull repairs.  So I read up in the mission and people seem to agree it is a very difficult Level 2.  We went back the next day multi-boxing my old Main in an Arty fit Rupture and the Thrashers providing close anti-frigate support and managed to pull it off without any problem.  But we would rather not multi-box every mission.
---
My question, are we in the right "weight class" for Level II's in a pair of Thrashers?  Is this a case of poor tactics/fits or do we just need to keep grinding LvL I's until we are in Cruisers?
---
p.s.  I know we shouldn't be salvaging Level 1 missions but the food pellet seeking behavior is strong in these two.

This subreddit became so toxic and passive agressive, I just downvote every CCPls and "devs dont care" posts and comments... Oh the irony.

well, yeah, my point is that as far as I know that fight was the only one calmil was actually informed of, at least in EUTZ, so they *could* have asked for our help in more situations if needed. We straight up offered help against snuff to some members, if that got to leadership or not is another matter. And yeah their goon allies were the safest bet, not mutually exclusive tho*.
---
*:for most at least

ps: yes i'm just low key salty we didn't get to kill more snuff, grr

Everyone is looking at me funny at work because it is silent here and i am laughing my ass off

Hi, you can send it to me for free, since you won't need isk anymore...

Would love to see CCP put a something in place that would stop the skill extraction from a botter that has been caught to prevent them from extracting the skill points and most of all the assets they have should ALL be seized.

LOOOOOL ALL THANKS TO BDO AMIRYTE LOLOL

---
Step 1: They join Legacy  
---
Step 2: Legacy sees who shit they are and want to kick them  
---
Step 3: Legacy poaches anyone they want  
---
Step 4: FEEDUP get kicked
---
Not saying you are far off Nate, but they also lacked the "super active" consistent command, which you guys haven't (at least i  past 2 to 3 yrs) and your relationship with Snuff is a major factor in everything past, present, future. It is a combo of ease and catering to peoples wants on their part, imo, but the current state of BR/Citadel also makes things bad for normal FW ir piracy there for a small or mid sized group. Amarr/Min lowsec better, and some of their pvp focus has been there
---
So Xenuria being on the csm when IWI was busted for RMT means that Xenuria personally robbed IWI?

"When you grow up, the most important thing in your life is gonna be Eve Online. A Spreadsheet Simulator. Eve, playing some Eve is more important than eating food. It's more important than drinking water. If I see a Freighter with cargo I like, I tell the pilot like this here: *Looks at Freighter* I likes you, and I want you. Now, we can do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way. The choice is yours. What's it gonna be?"
---
WMTR will rule in an empty empire :D

I swear some play dumb to get kicked/chased out of fleet so they can continue krabbing. Probably explains why they can't fly shit, all their skills are in VNI, drones, mining. And yes you get these people in every dam alliance.

oh don't get me wrong, the future will be very boring. All i'm saying is that while the amount lost is high it ain't happening often, so its not like you gotta replace it every week. Once you put that into account its really not hard to replace it, funancially at least.
---
Proc unless boosts are around the Cov. But I have basic mining skills and all Vs drone skills and Gallente Cruiser V  and Vs for both my corp's region drone races... so basically perfect subcap ratting skills. I average 20 mil ticks which is just way better than what moon mining averages for me.

now see this conflicts with what the guys in the other comment chain are saying
---
Hah I guess that is true Jibrish, and I admire reddit's freedom of communication to an extent, but let's be real about facts:
---
Reddit is where people go to talk about why women deserve to be raped and all manner of offensive horrific shit that isn't tolerated at other venues (e.g. Facebook and Youtube) for damn good reasons. You can keep laboring under the delusion that it isn't the bottomfeeding cesspool it's always been going back many years, but Reddit really hasn't changed all that much.
---
Oh wait, congrats reddit on getting rid of the child porn and shit, that must have been a real ethical nightmare for you. I'm sure you're getting better and will soon be a pillar internet posting that will save the world and move the needle or whatever.
---
Only you all know the exact details of you deal and I hope you have fun and enjoy your new space. I also wish you all the best in the future.
---
&gt;Plus it’s really hard to PvP AND watch Netflix at the same time. 
---
do you want to hear about our lord and saviour: the gila?
---
Would argue with best, that would probably go to TIKLE or even their good friends Brave, but to each his own
---
Well, if you are suicide ganking in HS you are still bad at PvP ofc but it is possible you are isk positive (but not a guarantee :P )
---
Anyway, I hate GSF and dislike goons in general but you seem alright.  Carry on!

Clearly you've never flown anything with a travel fit OP

who is he? played eve?

YEAH BUT UUUUUHHH ARE WE DPS OR TANK FIT
---
He wudnt have to rmt if gewns werent ruining game. Amirite
---
Destroyers are about damage at the expense of everything else. They have weak tank and anemic capacitor. All of the non-burner missions have one thing in common: you'll be taking a steady amount of damage that you cannot avoid, so you have to repair as you go. I think you'll need at least a cruiser to have enough capacitor to run repair modules, so you're on the right track with the Rupture.
---
i'd take a fedup member any day over a legacy one tho, at least of the ones who'd battle in the WZ. Whether that's praise for fedup, criticism of legacy or both it's up to you.
---
I need to make more of that ISK Silver was talking about. 
---
true, as a one off it's not a significant amount of losses.
---
Sorry brav, but found a great Corp and won’t drop it
---
&gt;What are your thoughts on this and how do you feel about jump clone cooldowns?

Your leadership is selling you out to a life of farming for Test. With a big side of this is a great thing for us. When the reality is you waged a war and just got an ass kicking. 
---
Being the bad guys is not so bad! Come give it a try. Plus you wouldn’t have to move!

rent space. get supers. get space again. or lose supers. its all good.
---
&gt;You can't blame us for problems that we have no control over.
---
How do I know what problems you do and don't have control over because from my perspective that's all NDA, or are you saying your voters are literally not in a position to judge you ever because then the question becomes what is the vote other than a popularity contents? 
---
&gt;Step 2: Legacy sees how shit they are and want to kick them
---
Then why are Requiem and WALKA still in Legacy?
---
&gt; threads that I feel are legitimately hurting the subreddit.
---
You are completely correct. I was a *very* active poster here up until about 3 months ago when I said "Fuck this hellhole" and unsubbed. This subreddit has devolved into the place you go if you want to shit on anyone not in your bloc and "REEEEEEE" about how your alliance/bloc is superior to every other alliance/bloc and literally nothing else of value to be found, or how CCP are the most incompetent developers in the history of the game. I feel like because of this, a lot of good people have just stopped trying to fight the dumb ass circle jerk and gave up. I know I went from commenting 3-4 times a day and reading the sub every couple of hours to not even really giving a fuck if I check once a week for any major political shifts I may not have caught in-game.
---
plated, youre looking at 2.4k -ish. still pretty fast. with implants and shiny prop, i push it to about 3.2 k, 4.5 OH. 
---
And as unlikely as it is that I could trade with a jag, using barrage, well, idk. i did it the other day, it was working out REALLY well for me, right up until his gang came to rescue him. 
---
anyways, theres alot to be said about manual piloting in those situations. trying to match transversal to improve tracking is something ive gotten pretty good at recently. Improve the tracking of barrage, and you can fight a scram kite rocket fit. In fact, I pushed off a hull tanked, AAR repped, scram kite rocket garmur TWICE the other day, using barrage. You might be skeptical, but my results in fighting rocket boats speak for themselves.

Application is also an important thing. The drones have to be able to keep up with and hit the enemies (orbit speed, distance, tracking, speed) Valks for instance are the fastest with the best tracking, hammers are the slowest etc. The aug hammers are popular because of their paper dps and the fact that thermal damage is pretty good against most enemies in the abyss ignoring the specific types. The other thing to keep in mind though is that damage is split damage, thermal and kinetic, and kinetic in my experience is wanting for enemy weaknesses there. 
---
The benefit of the Gila though means you can carry a flight of hammers, infiltrators etc. I tend to use aug infiltrators for small stuff in electric and firestorm and switch to hammers for larger stuff that is easy for the drones to keep up with.
---
At best, we can influence CCP. We aren't the ones making the decisions.

I just bring my inty unless they ping for baltecs.

And that's only because i have a 3 year old bhaalgorn I'm trying to kill. But every mega fleet I go on. The target docks and hides.

---
it's trivial with Alpha accounts. you have unlimited time to earn it. I've PLEXed off trial accounts several times before Alpha accounts when you only had 21 days to earn your first PLEX.
---
1 - mined 100m then station traded that into 400m within 21 days.
---
2 - flew around NRDS Providence and looted wrecks as well as doing PI in Provi - made the required 600m in 14 days.
---
3 - Farmed Faction War defensive complexes whilst Amarr was in Tier 4 - made 2.1B in 14 days.
---
Best way I would suggest now would be to join a newbie friendly nullsec group and use a salvage destroyer behind your corp mates VNIs or Carriers. Exploration is another option but for me it relies too much on RNG.
---
I thought you guys weren't friends? 
---
Yeah, I don't see how this is something to celebrate. Normally I like Snuff, especially if we're dropping shit together, but not a fan of how they're choking out lowsec. It's not healthy for the game.

\- I had fun shooting you guys after the standings reset!
---
\- I will have fun shooting you whenever I can again, and I will have fun shooting other targets by your side again if it happens!

Have fun in your deployement, we had wished for a longer campaign agaisnt you guys in Clour Ring and Pure Blind.

PPS: [WHO IS THE REAL PET HERE?!](https://i.imgur.com/aXw3pVd.gifv)
---
The problem is, it's like saying "someone call 911" in an emergency. Everyone will assume someone else will put in the extra effort, and so no one will call.
---
You need to pick on someone. "Hey you, spood487, bring your cyno to [system] and light it up". Rotate who you pick on, and if someone won't do it and doesn't have a  good excuse (ie cyno is halfway across the galaxy), kick em from fleet.
---
I've never been an FC, but this cartoon doesn't surprise me. 😂
---
Not gonna get deep into this argument since I'm associated with some of these groups, but: it's very hard to not be someone's pet in the age of super+fax dominance. If you don't have a super fleet, you better blue up someone who does or it's very dangerous to deploy capitals, which makes it very hard to fight for any real strategic objective. 
---
part of the problem of being in the second largest coalition and being pets of the largest coalition is you'll find that it is hard to find small-gang action.
---
Great! That bubble just trapped half our fucking fleet. It would have been better if it trapped their fucking fleet!
---
I want to play some subnautica. Does this mean I'm waking up?
---
According to the MER.... That should be Trillions and not Billions....
---
the thing is that calling 911 is not a common thing, if you're forming dreads *every single fucking dread pilot* should be able to light a cyno on their own if necessary, and that shouldn't be something uncommon

In high level sites the damage reduction type gets, like what, a 50% dps buff? It makes it worth using valks in pve which is freaking ridiculous. Auged drones only get half the bonus cause of split damage types so i don't think they are worth using in anything t4 and below.
---
Tbh you can run t4 gammas with like a 400 mil gila, it's ridiculously easy and cheap. When it comes to missile types for gamma and electric it's more complicated cause the gila gets a 50% damage bonus to thermal and kin making them roughly equivalent to the bonused damage missiles.

To skip the cooldown, you need to be in the same citadel as the clone you are jumping to - can't go across galaxy to swap clones with no cooldown, but can walk down the hallway in the same citadel.

The game of Schrodinger's csm begins.
---
The csm is always powerless when called out, but the question remains how to judge a CSM candidate, without taking their word for there achievements. 
---
Because Apparently, the state of the game isn't a good way to judge them ( they are not making decisions ), yet on the other hand judging them by the groups they are a member of isn't an option either for reasons, and well we can't judge them on the space they live in because well that's dumb. ( your words not mine ). 
---
As for the changes, they advocated a majority is NDA, so how exactly do you expect people that vote for a CSM to know if they did a good job or not?
---
Now if your position is people can't tell, it comes down to a simple question what's the point of voting for any of them in the first place, representative democracy tends to work because the voting records of the representatives are mostly public, and well having power means if everything has gone to shit you likely did a bad job, apparently none of this applies to the CSM.
---
So what tools do people really have left to see a good job from a bad job? because if your answer is none this whole endeavor is pointless and we might as well not have a CSM. 
---
Hey, I don't know what to tell you. I'm honest about what I've worked on and what I've not worked on. I tell folks the truth, and that's all I can do.
---
Shame I thought I locked down most things but apparently not. I wanted to leave cells open so people could play with it. However this was just a copy on a fresh account so it's not the only copy nor the one I actually use (also I'm currently on break from eve). If you want a copy let me know.

That's great and all but without any outside means to verify that statement, well I as a player can't know. ( you could be 100% honest or 100% lying to my face and I have no way to tell). 
---
Now my personal methodology of they live in this space under this banner there unlikely to destroy the game for there group, seems as good a method as any, is it better than a dice roll well idk but is a dice roll a bad voting methodology apparently not because all accountability is removed. 
---
Now if you on the CSM and do care about the game maybe that lack of any accountability should worry you ( it apparently doesn't because I seem to be getting page after page of reinforcement of that very system ). 
---
love to know what you guys were thinkin or sayin. Seemed everything was like just a flash
---
Well rip all those dreads I had. Think we only wanted 1 Titan. Not 22 of them.
---
I've campaigned on greater transparency, but I can't force CCP to reveal what they've done at our request and what we've stopped. That's the hard part. I tend to think that most players should be able to figure out who is being honest and who is bullshitting, but maybe I'm being a bit naive in that regard.

they are no longer needed because Alpha accounts are unlimited trials.

the old trial accounts did however allow you to train some skills not currently available to Alphas. like PI, and some market skills for example.

 Was in FEDUP until I saw the writing on the wall...SNUFF dropping staging shit in our systems was just the last straw... It's a FW "Alliance" trying to function in null.... How do you think it went in D2-H0S?  Fucking terrible...that's how.  Couldn't get a mining fleet for shit, nobody krabbed or did anything worthwhile which also means Fu\*\* SRP..You pay for ALL of your own shit and losses...There were many times I didn't log in just for that pure fact... The rich were already rich and the new people struggled....Didn't help much after SNUFF kicked our shit in.  Might I add leadership are total asshats, nobody really wants to help new people, and the whole fucking system is flawed....﻿ 
---
In our alliance, all doctrine ships are on contract. Buy ship, hop in, fit rigs, choose skin, undock.
---
noraus is that you?

The stick man shouting "i help, i am help" made me laugh.

Fuck you well played updot.

Like sure there are the standard social methods of telling somebody is lying and from an interview, one could guess but that seems a rather wanky methodology ( where you have no real way of knowing if you selecting better liars or people that are more truthful ), and if you permit a bit of humor given you an RL politician I suspect it's better liars rather than more truthful folks that make the filtering process. (next up we have a bunch of RL lawyers running for CSM ).
---
I do think it's interesting how we have gone from yeah that's not a good methodology to use instinct to tell how's bullshiting, maybe you want to consider that next time before you so zealously go in and tell people there methodology for selecting good from bad CSMs is wrong that you really don't have a better methodology to bring to the table. 
---
How knowns you might even take away from this why a CSM dominated by 1 coalition looks so bad to people outside that coalition regardless of what's being done because of the secrecy, but I'm likely being too optimistic there.

lol nice

As far as TEST goes, this was a corp op for SF. It wasn't even pinged out to the alliance. SF was asked to support Evictus and friends so we did. You win some and you lose some, but at least we all had fun. Thanks for the fight, frat.

God it's just SO GOOD! Sorry but I have to get this off my chest: 
---
Subnautica is by far and easily the best survival game of all time, ever. It's fucking rock solid, and a testament to what happens when you don't go the damn procedural generation route, and when you let the fans clean it up during early access. 
---
The handcrafted world is gorgeous, *juuuust* the right size, complexity and depth to maintain interest and never stop wowing you with new and gorgeous things, while maintaining a challenge throughout in terms of both exploration and mastering it. 
---
The genius of it all is that you never *settle* Subnautica. It doesn't matter where you go and how much you build or do, Subnautica's world is not yours and never will be. At your mightiest and most terrifying, you're still a very small little person in a world full of things that are not. You're a visitor and explorer, but that's where it stops. You will never be the conqueror. 
---
The pacing is just right, letting you develop and master both crafting, knowledge about both mechanics, wildlife and so on consistently all the way to the end. It doesn't require endless grinding, but it does require _some_ work to maintain yourself and your bases, while on top of that allowing for gentle leisure building and crafting just for pleasure and fun. 
---
The world itself is beautiful, and there's the one thing all survival games have failed at until Subnautica came along: 
---
It had a story that drives it all from beginning to end. And it does have an end, an actual end-goal that finishes the game on a beautiful bitter sweet note, then it smacks you across the face with a fantastic voice-over joke and you realize you've just finished a survival game instead of ending up in an "end game" of infinite grinding. 
---
I'm on my third playthrough of Subnautica as we speak and it _still_ gets me. I still hold my breath in fear as a certain fellow roars above and I'm hunkered down in silent running mode at the bottom, hoping not to get noticed. I still pause as my breath catches at the beautiful vistas and gorgeous hand-crafted locations from the Cove Tree, underwater rivers, bone forests, bulb forests, underwater islands, jellyshroom forest and all the countless other beautiful places. 
---
Hell, even something as simple as that first Redgrass Base. (We all did a Redgrass base, admit it). 
---
Gods it's just so good. 
---
Perfect survival game, 10/10, stand-alone expansion coming out soon. If you haven't played it yet, buy now and spend thirty hours or so marveling at the amazing damn game. 
---
First of all, every alliance worth their salt has a well-stocked market hub in their space. So there is no need for this idea in the first place.
---
Secondly, it would literally reduce the amount of PvP content in the game. Why would one ever want that?

Unfortunately I know an FC who's all over the floor. I read the "bring tackle" part in his voice.

&gt; Reddit is where people go to talk about why women deserve to be raped and all manner of offensive horrific shit that isn't tolerated at other venues (e.g. Facebook and Youtube)
---
It's also where millions of people go to decry exactly that. For the record - it isn't tolerated on reddit either. /r/incels is literally banned and the same goes for the myriad of other related subreddits. It's not an instantaneous process but facebook and youtube can't claim that either. There's no delusion - this is a fact. What you are touting is a pretty atypical edgy anti-reddit opinion. The issue isn't the platform (Well, the platform has a lot of issues but that's not the root of this discussion) - the issue you're referencing is that there are simply a metric shit ton of people here. You're completing ignoring things on a subreddit by subreddit level which is *deeply* flawed. On top of this you have no meaningful basis of comparison.
---
Most importantly of all though - how is this relevant to the discussion as it pertains to r/eve? A terrible subreddit elsewhere can be terrible. That doesn't impact what we do here. Reddit is basically the general forum of western civilization and there is 0 reason for me or r/eve to accept any form of responsibility or even relevancy about what happens elsewhere. I still think you're grossly wrong about it as a whole mostly because of a flawed argument - but maybe we can continue that portion of the discussion in PM's if you like.

Getting pretty burnt out of VNI ratting.  Money sucks, but if I want to chill with some TV explo is a bit too involved, and I'm still well over a year away from a carrier.  I was thinking of trying some Angel or Sansha 6-10/10s.  Can anyone suggest a good rattlesnake fit for that?
---
I also am in to the idea of farming my own sites instead of buying them.  I realize it's not the most isk efficient, but it suits my playstyle better.  Does anyone have any experience farming 6/10s with smartbombs?  What would that fit look like?  I assume my 10/10s will need to be purchased because in all my time ratting I've only got one of them with my slow ass VNI and most of the super ratters in my area get upset when VNIs are in Havens.
---
Thanks in advance!
---
I WAS THERE!
---
Hey mods if this deployment is gunna be daily TAPI feeds can we get a weekly "post your TAPI feed BRs here" so the rest of r/eve isn't buried constantly?
---
Of just have CONCORD "secure" the loot and deliver it to the top damage dealer.   Or require the hacking minigame be played to open and loot it.  Theres a lot of answers really.  
---
I’ve been living in LGK-VP for 12 years and I don’t want a gate.
---
Need more VNI fleets then
---
Thanks for the info. I'll go check out the forums. Btw, I've got deadspace and faction everything on my ratting rattle so...   :| 
---
I dont use the certs, I make another account and throw the new character on there. Not only is it cheaper (omega vs cert), but i can have two characters logged in at the same time. Eve has this functionality built in you can even use the same email address.
---
Mined my ass off, got kicked from Corp for an unregistered alt (my fault), injected a few times (lol) and can now fly some pretty badass ships. No regrets about joining a big Null Corp, even met some chill dudes and dudets. 
---
I run into ISBN Freeport structures in wormholes regularly. I can’t recall the exact corp/alliance that stated/organizes this though. Wormhole Life it something similar. [WORM] is the tag IIRC. 
---
I love how the logi FC in my alliance reminds logi to remember their whore drones, when the official fit uses logi drones, 
---
Literally get rid of the kenitic lock bonus and replacing it with an application bonus would be great for it.

Also can you ask CCP about looking at the Nighthawk's fitting as well?

What about Phase 5? I bet there is a horse head involved there.
---
No I think test had decided to feed the north until they are to full of killmails to keep up.

I'm just trying to build a spreadsheet to calculate the amount of ores i would need to manufacture stuff. i can figure most of it out i was just looking for some examples to build my spreadsheet with as a shortcut.

Thank you! 
---
Like what methodology rolling dice? 
---
Also, it's not exclusively coalition membership its over-representation of particular playstyles that form the core objection ( it's why I don't think 4 NC dudes on the CSM would really solve the issue and why I use HK rather than PL as an example because they have a different playstyle from you ). 
---
Given we have no judgment of quality membership the best idea is to get as many different playstyles on the CSM and hope the devs get as much feedback, because in my view the CSM isn't gonna achieve changes and my take on the CSM has always been they exist to scream loudly at CCP before they do something dumb, but by that standard the current CSM is terrible.
---
Because it takes reddit outrage every time to get CSM to cancel bad idea's.
---
Good stuff, I like stitch's way of flying battleships and finding off-meta stuff to work with. I don't agree with his views on marauders though..
---
Stitch is the reason why I go out and solo pvp rather than fleet/gang pvp. It's hard and it results in a shit-ton of deaths, but there's nothing as rewarding as it.
---
looks like they are off to a good start....

It's completely useless for me because its focused on capital production, i'm not a cap producer i'm looking into producing ships and ammo.

This is very helpful as a visual person. THANKYOU

This speaks to me on so so many levels
---
I give a shit about the game and there's only 3 areas of space in it.  Hisec is a lost cause, nullsec is coalescing into 2 factions, and lowsec seems like it's terminally ill largely thanks to one alliance.  Sure, they're on my side of the fence, but I'd be a shitty friend if I didn't point out when they're making a mistake.
---
Could do one for flight time, explosion radius, velocity and explosion speed across the sizes of missiles.
---
Well here you go, most of the extras I did are for cap production as well but you can just ignore those 2 tabs and just use the ore ones, dark ochre is added now btw.

&gt; It's just too damn easy to spend a little time with a member and figure out what doctrines they have ready/can fly and what to bring if they aren't there yet.
---
Multiply "a little time" by 50 and then see if its so little or if its a full time job.
---
Totally agree on the losing something. Getting to Stain, surviving and managing to find a safe place to dock up and put a jump clone was great. Particularly since I was chased a decent amount of the way. 
---
I host a Corp personal Pathfinder in AWS and had to change the environments.ini path to CCPs new backend manually as the owner of the git repo has yet to release the change himself.

His hosted Pathfinder that is free for all will not work until he makes the change on his own .ini.

Well thank you i really appreciate it.

I just want to say thanks to a lot of the larger content creators for getting me into solo pvp in the first place. I know the video isn't flashy and is fairly average, but I had a lot of fun in the process of making this video; both playing and editing it. I hope you enjoy!

---
You should look into meta level fittings too. T1 modules will only go so far, and generally meta fittings offer one or more benefits or reduced penalties compared to T1 at similar cost.
---
Destroyers also pump more damage but tank worse. Even if they fit the same repairer with the same resists, they will be slower and fatter targets. They also usually lack the slots for tanking that frigate counterparts have. The advantage is only high damage well-applied to targets, so if you are overwhelmed or facing a tanky target then you won't do as well. Speed and range maintainance are often key to mitigating damage since you can often outtrade at longer ranges or very close range depending on the fit.
---
Or T1 cruisers will work fine.
---
A caution if you double arty rupture:
---
Artillery has shit tracking. If something is orbiting close and being problematic, you may not be able to hit it.
---
One solution if you are both in arty ruptures is to split apart and hit each others' associated targets.

Good stuff, love the wee atron. Come to Asakai more!

Yea bud it’s usually got action, with a few contested systems on each side. 
---
Thats great news!
---
everyone knows who runs it dude, don't be obtuse
---
In larger fights your repping drones get deleted by smartbombs along with the enemy drones and you get nothing,  its better to have a flight of light drones so your logi wing can have some self defence ability to deal with tackle, bombers and booshers.
---
Nice fights!

In theory sure but the income from selling these things amounts to several billion a day. They use at least a dozen characters with Gilas and seem happy to no life it so ultimately its simply impractical and no one bothers.
---
Can't critise someone for spotting an opportunity but when people can leverage a piece of content to such a degree it seems fair to question the design that allows it.
---
But Cosmos has been broke for a decade, long abandoned. It'll never change. Shame really as telling a story is about the only way to make PVE in Eve compelling. 
---
try posting in the question thread, and try joining a good nullsec corp so you get access to their training content and help from seniors. You boost standing by running missions and once every 10 or 12 missions doing the storyline gives you a large boost,
---
Is it a thing to fly an exploration ship, find the juicy WH/null sites and ask in corp chat if someone is willing to join the hunt, or am I just dreaming?
---
I always thought that was almost the sole point of this role in a corp (which, btw, is perfectly fine with me as long as the loot is split up for the effort).
---
Surely I always drooled before the big, shiny battleships and capital ships, but I still felt more attracted by support roles (logistics/EWAR, if I read correctly, are almost always needed).
---
Why would anyone offer their enemies a free foothold in their space?
---
it used to be full 24 hrs no skill to reduce it. at least now i can jumpclone at the end of the night and jump back the next day after work
---
refineries and structures?

No, winmatar isn't pretty big. "total members" in corp info means nothing if theres only 3 people in the entire alliance getting more than 20kills: https://i.imgur.com/8fFBWkf.png

Not trying to shit on you as we've worked together a bit before, but you're really not as big (or active) as you'd like you believe you are.

Yeah. So we can't talk about it again if it was brought up while ago and didn't get resolved since then?

The current, "Updates" listed on the Eve website doesn't contain a lot of content, features, ships, etc. at the moment.

Also, is there anywhere I can go to find such information? I'm currently searching the forums and updates section, but am not seeing any hint as to what is to come next.

Tbh Fed Up isn't even that old of a FW corp and hasn't  focused on FW for a while. Also, they are probably  staying in FW despite holding sov... like they have been for the last two years. 
---
There is no official information on any of those as yet, I'm afraid. They don't publicize their entire production schedule, only small parts of it. 
---
Ah, the solo battleship menace and the solo dread god. Great interview, hope to see new videos from both of you soon. :) 
---
There is a Cosmos missions that pays out an HG-1008 (8%) module which requires an item with long, timable respawns that the guy in the image has had locked down 23/7 for I don't even know how many years now. They also scan down and hold hostage a mission item in the same system for the Michi implant. It's impractical to gank him due to the number of alts/ships used so it's all kinda a bit broken.
---
Ironically if they left the implants value would tank in value (currently 3b and 1.5b to sell orders respectively) and no one would care but it still shines a light on a terrible piece of game design.

we actually made tremendous gains in tenerifis over the first two weeks down there including killing two keepstars and world first moreau fortizar, then ualx happened which really wasn't that bad relative to other supercap fights at that scale (tidi really prevented us from eviscerating each other the way you would have expected)

they tried to hit the pl staging fort in zmv like 3 times during the camp, expecting to win on sheer weight of numbers, but the one time they followed up for an armor timer it ended up an embarrassing carrier fleet welp for them
---
I can't say we succeeded in that campaign, but it wasn't pl's resolve that broke, it was skillu. they're a bunch of weenies who didn't want to do what needed to be done (read: sit in tidi and f1 titans for a few hours a couple more times) in order to actually win, and they pulled out
---
without them, with the addition of goons, and without a full ncdotto deployment, we didn't have the numbers for direct supercap fights, so we cut our losses and pulled out
---
again, I'm not saying we succeeded, but it was far from an embarrassing failure. don't let the dinoposters fool you, for a minute there until vily bent the knee it really looked like the day of the meteor
---
but tapi did the only thing they really could have done, bent the knee, and stopped us
---
It was only 10 Dammit
---
aight im done with reddit for today thanks
---
frat are the actual best dudes and I'm glad for them
---
&gt; It makes it worth using valks in pve which is freaking ridiculous
---
But aren't Valk II, Berserker II and Bouncer II the go to for Angel Cartel pve? Augmented deal partial kinetic damage and depending on the Angel rat you will be dealing less damage than tech II drones.

Ah okay thanks for the write up. I legit am OOL as i dont dabble in nullsec politics and just have either biased opinions from friends on either side, or reading about it here on reddit (which is obviously the most reliable source of info).
---
I dont blame skillu for pulling out; sitting in tidi for hours waiting to DD is the exact opposite of fun (although strategically important and the autists who like that stuff have a special awwww from me), and opposite their play style.

That said, TEST was fighting for survival, survived, and has now adapted to the meta, Delvising Esoteria. Would you day, in your opinion, that this might be the way forward for PanFam after this current war of southern aggression?

Fuck that guy. :|
---
Yeah, that's true. If I could consistently dedicate 40~50 hours a week to modding the amount of problems the sub has would go down immensely and I would be able to do stuff with the subreddit for the greater Eve media community at a far greater scale(Think charity events for AbleGamers and what not). But it would still be a never ending backlog and that's for what amounts to being a glorified spam filter. The community teams workload has got to be a never ending torrent on a scale that the entirety of r/eve couldn't even begin to compete with.
---
Why is EvE space lacking in all the varied structures that the universe has? Where are the pulsars, quasars, black holes, galaxies, double-stars ..etc? Very soon after I joined I realized it was just stars, planets, and moons. WHs are just other solar system, and sometimes you see a nebula in the horizon. 
---
Wouldn't it be great if there was a pulsar that jammed all ships with every pulse within a range, or a black hole that'd suck your ship to oblivion beyond the event horizon..etc? I find space in EvE needlessly simplified. Even if those entities had no mechanics, it'd still make the a game a lot prettier.

---
ewar drones
---
This change was announced a while back, more than enough time to sell
---
Pulsars and Black Holes do exist in wormholes, and they do affect gameplay - Pulsars give bonuses to shields, and Black Holes increase ship and missile velocity. What you're asking for is a tremendous gameplay change for reasons of fluff, and that's unreasonable.

I've often thought that real life is like the first character you ever played in EvE, you didn't know what you were doing, didn't know what you should be learning but it was so much *fun* you didn't care. 
---
Then you get to the end of your life and wish you could roll a new character with all the experience of your first one.
---
Is it possible that you grossly overestimate the potential buyer base of Eve swag?
---
If it's like other industries lots of people say "I would buy that". Then a incrediably small fraction of people actually do.
---
Oh wow. Do i see the beginnings of a sizable titan fleet?
---
It's a risk, finding a place to have these made at high quality is not easy. Then it has to be at a price you the consumer will pay. It is also complicated because of this game being international.
---
They can do better, but it is not easy.
---
I have to second the point about the pins.  I understand the point about projectile overlap... perhaps instead place the proper size circle at the real point, grey fill or striped, with a box next to it (or inset)
---
Makes me happy to see so many big fixes
---
Probably even smaller in our case because of the shipping costs

I'm asking for at least more visual fluff. You fly around and it's the same star at the center of the system surrounded by a few asteroid belts and some planets. There's more exotic stuff out there that would visually make space more interesting. I do astrophotography as a hobby and space could be made to be more entrancing than it is in-game.
---
Lmao fucking sad. At least templis went to wildlands to fight and bloc to SC. You are just pussies once you felt the snuff blob. Couldnt expect more from snuff pets.

I think they could do something like sell it threw Amazon to have a state side suppler to avoid the shipping cost of Iceland

Played Eve for 3 months last year, put 600 hours into it and then stopped. If my corp didn't disband I would've kept going it was kind of a blessing. Never consumed so much information in such a time span in my life.

CCP woudn't have to worry about riots if like you said, they would just communicate with us.
---
I 100% agree with bugme143 on his reply of "I honestly cannot remember the last time I read that sort of thing when it wasn't damage control weeks or months after the fact" I cannot remember the last time they just owned up and said "right lads, we made a mistake, we will look into ways of fixing/sorting or rolling back within x days/weeks" and we would pretty much say "well done for admiting it and communicating a timeframe to be fixed" instead we get fuck all for months and a back handed way of saying we messed but but fuck you guys.

Carry a mobile depot and MTU with you. Try to stick to Fortification Frontier Stronghold sites since they'll be easier for you. If you get below 30% shield and are still dropping then warp out and warp back (warp tank). On land drop ur depot and MTU and orbit ur depot at 500. Keep an eye on ur tank, when ur tanking find (no battleships on field) u can swap out some lowslots to drone damage amplifiers and/or an omnidirectional to hit smaller stuff better, gives you better site times.  
---
(The T2 rigs are pretty mandatory for your tank BTW, I wouldn't recommend cheaping out with T1s)  
---
That fit should run you around 180mil so much cheaper than a rattle and a very solid ship for learning the ropes with C3 ratting.
---
Take things slow to begin with, if ur unsure then staying on the max tank refit is fine, it takes some practise to get used to when its safe to swap to damage lows.
---
If you have any questions about C3 ratting, wormholes in general, or just want to chat with fellow wormholers you can join the in-game channel "Spoopy Public". We like helping people out, even if you're not initially interested in joining our corporation we're always happy to help. :)

True.  One of our data sources that very few people use changed it’s API rules the other day with telling us.  This broke that small portion of the platform.  One client complained.  We had that fixed in a bit under 24 hours.

---
not sure what your point is considering your anecdote further proves how rubbish reddit's format is for discussion
---
3rd party owned forums are the way to go, not official ones
---
C3 sites don't generally point you so you can experiment a bit and warp out if you need to. They do apply some neut pressure.
---
A myrm (see post above) can do some of the sites, though the drones will probably take a lot of pressure.
---
A passive gila can do the same sites, with good skills. That's also quite expensive though.
---
Rattlesnakes are the best ship for it really and you should be able to scout entrances with corpmates/alts and be fairly safe.

Very nice to see, thanks for posting OP

I guess that's the beauty of EvE, gives them an out from a shitty life for a while.
---
They did add a salt shaker
---
Yeah, it's not like it would bring a lot of attention to it quickly and allow it to be banned by CCP. Pretty sure that without reddit outree nothing will happen to this bot soon enough

---
&gt;Features  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**safe**: does not inject into or write to the eve online client. That is why using it with eve online is not detectable.  
---
&gt;**accurate &amp; robust**: Sanderling uses memory  reading to retrieve information about the game state. In contrast to  screen scraping, this approach won't be thrown off by a noisy background  or non-default UI settings.  
---
&gt;**easy to use**: You will achieve quick results with the integrated script engine and API explorer.  
---
&gt;**comprehensive**: Sanderling is used to build mining, trading, mission running and anomaly ratting bots.
---
(removed all links)
---
So the only hook i see to detecting this on a technical level is detecting the memory read, which is basically impossible with the bot program running in kernel mode and Eve just in user mode.
---
Whats more interesting is, is that you seem to have to pay per minute for the operation of the bot (in "credits" i haven't checked out the website yet). There is some serious effort going on providing frameworks for devs to make bots, no wonder it is so hard to go up against that RMT industry..

Its called giving a hand and why you form coalitions. You'd have to have allies that do anything to know I guess.
---
But, supers and titans? SNUFF would have evicted them from their pocket without doubt. If you stick around to fight them SNUFF would escalate every time they feel they are losing.

Sticking around near SNUFF would have been death for that alliance.

Very nice tactical advice thanks!   Could we use Keep At Range (Optimal Arty) for one of us vs the other and I could pilot relative to the mission room....then use Look At (Bro Ship) and pick targets from off that view?

First new Eve video I've enjoyed in a while. Thanks for making it.

If you don't mind me asking, what overview pack do you use, or did you customise it yourself?

most would rather not take that risk.

i mean imagine that in delve.  
---
"oh jee, thats alot of "peaceful" caps your bringing in. you wouldnt happen to be preparing for war would ya"

Goons would nuke that citadel so fast, as would any nullsec power

Inserting this into that ingame ship tree like on a separate tab so new guys could get this info and actually use it would be super cool.

Eh, that’s the price we pay.

ever read Empires of EVE?   they tried that in the north.

and thus the Venal Civil war and Great Northern Wars occured.

I agree that his fits are fascinating, I like seeing people trying to do offbeat stuff.

It's an overview a friend gave me, to which I customized it slightly. I have no idea where he found it/if he made it and couldn't source it multiple times that I've lost it. I can try to send you an evemail of the overview though (if that's a thing).
---
Glad you enjoyed the video!

Most ISK positive play is probably to stay docked, but at the end of the the day this is a game, and it's fun to go find fights. 
---
High praise indeed, I have a couple in the works, should be more stuff up on the channel soon.
---
If we each get to fly our favorite ship I feel pretty good about my odds :)
---
totally agreed. i do work like mentioned above. if the OP is important to me i do call specific people to d8 jobs AND i have my team that usually doesnt make ot necessary to even call dudes. but that's a respect thing. in my experience the regular line member does not know how much work and time it requires to run a fleet. some of them come online and demand to be fed while shipspinning on station. and dare you, they didnt get a kill. that's a personal thing but whoever is in my fleet is automaticly part of the OP in all consequences. lucky me i am german so people dont react to suprised when my inner nazi shows up and i am well aware that not everyone enjoys my fleets (but that were always only some dudes, i usually always have/had a very high participation). 
---
beside the fact that i also think that everyone who owns a cap should own a cyno alt to be able to move it (here comes the rule again: be usuful and not a burden to your ally or your corp or you be gone), it was also a demanded setup for everyone since the objective was 2-5 jumps out from our staging point and we were using caps nearly on a daily base for over a year. 8 minutes skilltime for cyno on lvl 1, simply no excuse to not have a cyno toon. worst case it's on a different toon on the same account but -everyone- can do it. :)

Yes
---
With projectiles, especially autocannons, it's actually often better to be in falloff even.
---
You can also doubleclick to fly your own ship to a certain heading. 
---
Also for identifying targets, eventually you may find use of the fleet broadcast system.
---
Yeah I feel the same way about drone damage amplifiers
---
The amount of people that ask me "what are we flying" or "can i bring &lt;insert retarded non-doctrine ship here&gt;" but refuse to read the MOTD of the fleet make me want to unsub...

I used to interact with hisec mercs from 2012-late 2014 or so. He's not wrong. The likes of Noir. and The Orphanage are long gone. MC has twisted from being a merc corp to, well, what it is today. You might as well give your ISK to a Jita ISK doubler than find a highsec merc corp that won't take your money and run.

I have. ‘Incompatibility’ between 2.7 and 3 isn’t a thing: use six to write code that functions under both or just use 3 because it’s 2019.

Low level libraries!? Are you kidding me!? Python is a high level language. If you want to interact with hardware, use another language. You’ve literally stated the opposite. What alternative are you talking about that is higher level?

I'm obviously very biased, but I'd honestly suggest you just join an alliance, at most you are asked to join a PVP fleet every now and then, and maybe you'll end up with a few more friends and a good experience ;-)

This says otherwise.

That's what I was thinking... I'm not sure what people expect. Dread Bombs are Eve's version of the vehicle borne IEDs. They aren't meant to make it out of you're using them. These things are already dead the day they're made.

sitting in tidi for hours waiting to dd is what i did for ualx. except i didn't *just* do that, i also cleaned my apartment, prepped some meals, and caught up on my netflix queue (ps watch sabrina, doomchinchilla thanks you for your service). you don't 100% have to focus on the game the whole time, especially since i was using my wireless headset
---
i could probably stand to do that a couple times a month, all things considered it was a very productive 11 hours or so for me
---
as far as the way forward for panfam, i think this geminate conflict is a lot better for us than for tapi - i haven't seen any defensive timers for a while, and having content right on our doorstep is making it a lot easier to bulk up our numbers to stay relevant in modern eve. we do have work to do on the industrial front to keep up in the titan arms race, but we're not really as catastrophically behind as reddit would have you believe
---
realistically tho the main thing still preventing all out game ending supercap conflict is how incredibly fucking aids citadel mechanics are. nobody wants to deal with them, honestly, i don't know for a fact but ill bet most goons were pretty relieved that gotg ransomed them out of their invasion because holy fuck i would actually kms irl if i had to grind that many keepstars even unopposed

I believe the Wrecking Machine makes it their primary area of interest to bash HS structures: http://www.wreckingmachine.net/

Is this not for ECM Burst Jamming in sub-capital fleets?
---
really, really like how you played the neuty tristan fight
---
that was good intuition to know that because his damage was so delayed that you could close the gap and end the fight faster
---
also CCP FIX YOUR SHIT
---
Although you can switch clones in a citadel, to bypass the cooldown, the system is still deserves some developer atention:  
---
1. If clone switching isn't penalized by cooldown in a citadel, why can't be the same applied to NPC stations.
---
2. Sure you can bypass the CD by switching in a citadel, but why can't you store multiple cones in an enormous starbase? Only the code gets in the way.
---
3. If you have trained your Infomorf sync V, and that gives you 5 hours minus on your CD. The skill's effect might be more substatial. 50%/25% decrease at V.? 
---
4. Since the clones you have are sort of "vessels" for your infomorp, why can't you handle them like ships. Why can't you haul a bunch of pods, with inactive clones to another base? Why can't you assign them to courier contracts?
---
5. Simulated clone during ship simulation?   
---
And for the mechanism (clone jump cooldown). It's necessary to counter the unbalanced force projection that it would cause otherwise.
---
I never said it was timely, but it does disprove your statement.
---
Honey, come to bed
---
shaddup woman, I'm playing eve for science.
---
They aren’t farmed as hard due to regional instability.
---
Blood Raiders are heavily farmed. This makes a lot of sense.
---
If you are on your own any system will pretty much do as you won't be able to reach 100% utilization.  I'd shoot for a dead end system (e.g. only one gate in).  You can get a shitty one for about 4B or so per month.  A fort and sotiyo will cost a bit more to build caps.  Probably looking at around 20B + with rigs.  Just fyi, for renting there isn't a response fleet so rorq mining is probably out of the question, but you can run a fleet of barges or carrier rat.  
---
I was in SH1 and it was fucking miserable. I promised myself never again and disappeared into a wormhole for the next year. I don't have the time or will to dedicate myself to that, even if it means I can do some chores or whatever (I also don't have a wireless headset, I play on a single monitor gaming laptop setup, and my chores are outdoors as living in a rural area are). Of course, different strokes for different folks, and some people genuinely enjoy it even if its for the "i was there" factor.
---
I think this Geminate conflict is good for EVE, as any conflict is, and even if TEST doesnt make any major headway into Geminate, it will be valuable experiece for both sides on all levels. I think conflicts like these is where mid-level FCs and content in between the major CTAs really shines.
---
Good luck to you guys, and just like you say not to underestimate PL,i say dont let these recent TEST flops cause you to underestimate them.
---
r/eveporn is not what I expected.
---
This info is going to the wiki!

Ugh noo, it was already bad enough coming across 6 relic sites all cherry picked last night.
---
Aaand they just pushed it back by another patch release. 
---
Do you go armor or shield?
---
Also how well do you think it scales with domis? I know the mass limit only accepts a couple of battleships doing a round trip.
---
Now just bring back old aura

You do you dude. Flash will come with time.

Good vid

I mean day 1 u was thinking it seems like it shouldn't work with fighters, but then ccp didn't change it so I'm not sure why you would think it was unintended at that point.

you die to bubble camps in null.  you can die to insta lockers in lowsec (but you should survive).  you can die to smart bombs but you shouldn't.

Absolutely! I'll get to practicing binds as soon as possible.
---
Glad you enjoyed the video, and yeah, the atron is definitely a fun hull to fight with!
---
Except the document is designed to make the larger, most eyecatching thing on the right, which isn't the longest-ranged ammo on some of them.  You have to spend time learning the design of the graph before being able to use it.  With the table you look for the green-colored range items and you're done.  Can be seen with one glance, I don't have to study the document to figure out how it is laid out.
---
With the table it is easier to see the patterns and trends between each flavor of ammo as well, so you can learn things like "Oh the ammunition goes up in damage by 4 per item, but cap usage is adjusted by 10% each time".
---
I see no way in which the chart provided here is superior than the small, well-organized table I linked, even in your example.
---
^shhhhhh
---
Thinking that FEDUP has a Super fleet is the ruse here.
---
So nothing changes
---
Mm hmm, though I did underestimate the strength of the tristan's neut at optimal (which is ironic since I've used it myself many times!) Glad you enjoyed the video regardless!
---
I miss those days, tbh. Especially since it changed the name of the ship to "\[faction name\] \[ship type\]" - so it was more obvious that you were flying with a skin.
---
Tell me that this is about killing drifter bosses while bubbled on citadel. 
---
mercenaries are easily confused, you know the type, simple... You may have made them think they where supposed to defend it so instead they docked up
---
Unless it's actually a Drake fleet, then you ask to bring a Ferox.
---
realistically the null sec regions are divided too much so that each block only needs the use of their own ports.  There isn't much need for a shared structure.  And if anything, Jita basically serves this purpose. 
---
Haven't there been freeports in geminate for a while now?
---
What are binds?  Are you just talking about the function keys or something else?
---
Where is the bugfix for wasting the last 12 year's of my life? Glitchy fucking game. If you're seeing this Rebecca I want you back.....im so alone
---
There are ways to open it up to monetization which has a third party supplier assume the risks of production while CCP just gets royalty kick-backs. Especially in these days of dropshipping and amazon.  
---
It would require some policing of their IP, but they're already doing that now, so the added cost would be marginal.
---
anything - if you can't reach the function keys well, then rebind them
---
it's in the options and using keybinds for modules makes everything far more smooth and responsive, especially with heat toggles bound too
---
Nobody manufactures at scale in Iceland anyway, direct shipping from manufacturers in China is probably a better way to go.
---
Look at your market and see what’s moving a lot. Build that to sell. Look at your hangar and see what you use most often. Make that to save isk. 
---
Since prices can change here is a thing.
---
Paste this to evepraisal, divide the result by 100 and you get the expected value per site for that faction.

I do agree that the sp farming being so self sustaining is a problem.  But I disagree that it is a difference with instantly purchasing a pretrained titan pilot and instantly purchasing the needed sp to inject into a titan pilot.  Mayhaps it is a bit too quick now to get into a Titan pilot with the sheer amount of self sustaining sp out in the game now but I also dont believe it Should or even should've taken years to get into a Titan pilot or have an unusable character because that is all they are training into.  I still see the skill injectors as a good thing in general but perhaps need to be made not so self sustaining in terms of the farms.  I have been a big proponent of not limiting things to do in game by sheer giant amounts of time.
---
Floating Nyx please.
---
This system was much more "EVE" If you buy it, you should be able to loose it. 
---
Except that the average nullkrab doesn't give a fuck about pve in lowsec.  There's not much point when they have havens and ore belts in much more defensible pockets in sov null.  
---
Keep your eyes open for lone Titans ♥
---
Isnt hotshotgg CEO?
---
no.  theres just been 1 neut astra that no body bothers killing cause citadels are more trouble to kill than they are to replace.
---
and that one is replaced before we even kill it so....CCP fked up
---
but its not a market, just a low power abandoned citadel cause CCP doesn't understand Sov or understand that making a citadel with long reinforce periods with no fuel, artificially long kill times due to dmg cap, cheap as hell to made,  AND self repairing. is a shitty design.
---
r/dataisbeautiful is leaking! Nice work and good job.
---
Jesus we really are nerds.
---
Guess you missed the memo about Munin’s 
---
Damn, blood raiders are almost as bad as data sites!
---
You're not wrong here, but I do think it's worth mentioning that when WANGS foned SNUFF, you lot folded into the fleet as well, which isn't inconsequential. You effectively doubled the number of subcaps we (calmil) were facing. FEDUP was and continues to be huge and well organized.  Against a WANGS/FEDUP/SNUFF fleet calmil didn't really stand much chance most times. Calmil often dared not escalate with capitals against your combined fleets, as any earnest capital engagement that didn't go in your favor would surely result in the rest of imperium being called (as snuff was a member at the time). 
---
While I generally like FEDUP and its pilots, I don't really feel the slightest bit bad for you right now.  When external oppressive entities like snuff fuck with lowsec, FW adversaries have long joined up to repel them.  This happened all the time in the amarr wz against one time large entities like DHSJ.  That FEDUP instead joined WANGS and SNUFF fleets so that you could dunk your FW adversaries with little effort such that they eventually left, and are now forced to flee your homes by the forces you once supported should be a lesson.  I'm not sure either DNG or FEDUP will ever again make our homes in BR, but if we do, and if we both end up there at the same time, I sincerely hope you make the correct choice the next time around.
---
If you are staying in Hisec or lowsec, fly around to the regions and look at the markets to see the prices / volume that is moving.  Then figure out if you actually make isk on it.  Then run off a few batches, haul them out to the markets you want to use (make sure to account for any listing costs) and see if your math and hunches paid off.  
---
Minmatar either has overused or underestimated ships. There's not really a middle point. This is why minmatar is one of my favourite ship lines.
---

---

---
We will, birds of a feather and all that
---
my fundamental concern with tapi is that progod is their only fc who has any real talent for it at all (except vily who plays talkshows online now) and even though he's pretty good at shepherding tapi around he's not exactly spectacular in terms of results versus efficiency - take the dread welp the other day for instance
---
the rest of them are mediocre at best or godawful feedlords at worst and they don't seem to have any sort of system in place to groom new fcs for stratops. like fuck me for bringing it up but at least old brave had a system for letting junior fcs backseat and teaching them and shit. but farmstink doesn't ever seem to get better, you know?
---
so like outside of ustz with progod running the fleet they will probably never actually accomplish anything anyway, and what happens when he burns out and takes a break?
---
Add W4PED to that list too lol
---
Typhoons are actually pretty cool kite rappid heavy platform 
---
For the record, we never 'joined' WANGS and SNUFF. We may have fleeted up with WANGS, but we didn't know SNUFF was coming any more than you did. And half the time after SNUFF blapped you guys they turned their guns on us.

Top Ships used this week in PVP that are Minmatar:
---
1.) Sabre
---
2.) Loki
---
3.) Stiletto
---
Minmatar hold Place 1-3 in most used Ships for this week, Id say they are in a fine Position. 
---
Also they got the Huginn, best Web ship in the game for Range and used alot and many other ships.
---
Even in PVE the best Carrier to use to Rat is the Hel or Nidhoggur. 
---
Minnies are fine imo
---
DVC is recruiting

This motherfuckers gotta get better at naming albums

My man, As much As I would love for my corp to take the notoriety for this. It wasn't just F-OFF. It was Evictus. Mixed with Some test.
---
The EVE experience and game play is still very much unique.  If there was something else out there that was similar, most of us would leave.  But is it "good"?  You have to try it to figure it out, it appeals to a small niche of players. It isn't pay to win, but you can end up spending way way too much time if you let yourself. 
---
Looking at the data that seems to be the reasoning for the prices. The factions that can be farmed easily due to umbrellas etc are angels and blood raiders. No coincidence they're the lowest paying right now
---
and req... THESE MOTHERFUCKERS
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
Umbrellas add to regional Stability. Player saturation/activity ensures farming. I would say the biggest contributor to those things being farmed are the sheer numbers packed into those regions making it a compact footprint.
---
Scratches out 2032 in the calendar
---
*Sighs*
---
Marks a spot in 2033
---
Yup I'm agreeing with you
---
Well, we shall see. TEST has enough mid-level FCs and time in between major stratops, all that is required is initiative from them to make things happen which leads to actual experience. Plus all the playfights with goons &amp; friends help gain experience.
---
On the PL side,who's still active and still FCs aside from Hedliner? Or are you guys going to hire Elo Knight again (LOL XD MEMES)?
---
Wow. Excellent work on this. Thank you very much.
---
Come on, this is the internet. Surely it should be billion's, ton's, ship's, refinerie's and structure's.
---
PVE is basically drones online so Gallente (VNI, Ishtar) are a solid choice.  PVP king is Minmater (Sabre, Loki, Muninn).  For caldari, Ravens are used in some comps.  Ferox / Caracals are still used for cheap home defense.  I have no idea what people fly Amarr for other than to look bling.  
---
I feel like a good balance would be selling skin BPOs instead of permanent SKINs.  
---
That way there's some planning that goes into flying a skinned ship, they can be lost, they can be traded, etc - and conceptually if someone's stupid the BPOs can be ganked or stolen.
---
Thanks!

Copyright doesn't have a "not for profit" clause. It's a common misconception.
---
The fair use exceptions to copyright are: criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. Even then these aren't absolute exceptions. 
---
You are one salty sailor
---
This only applies to trademarks. You don't lose other forms of IP (copyrights / patents) this way.
---
That being said, I'm sure CCP doesn't want to lose any of their Eve related trademarks.
---
Whats the net profit margin for this?
---
I know it depends on volume but...
---
Farming 6/10s is a great idea because of the low startup cost. For smartbomb farming, you need to look for the kind of Rally Points where all the ships spawn at the same spot. They're found in high truesec null. Fit up a battleship with 8x meta smartbombs and two stasis grapplers. The grapplers are to prevent the battleship(s) in the last wave from getting out of range too quickly. For better results add a second smartbomb battleship.
---
Awesome man. Good information!
---
Can't remember, i think about 5 or so.
---
Slaved armour ac mwd muninn!
---
Ive seen videos that use a machiriel. Is there some specific bonus why they used that ship or will any t1 boat with 8 highs have similar results? 
---
&gt;I have no idea what people fly Amarr for other than to look bling.
---
Malediction is the best interceptor, Retribution is one of, if not the best, solo/small gang frigates, Guardians are straight-up broken, bhaalgorns are a staple of wormhole combat, and a Legion can do... this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQytP0l0pyU

I think your data may not be representative of the larger r/Eve community. :-)

Make a new account and then biomass after you're done
---
Biomass ? A new account or a new character ?
---
¿Por que no los dos?
---
I've never met a T1 Ammo you couldn't profit off of in a trade hub, let alone in farther regions. The issue is that the % margins are huge, but the actual profits are low.   
---
I'd recommend Ammo as a way to learn the ropes and prove that you can make money... but then immediately move on.  
---
To give an example of what I'm talking about:  
---
**Scourge Heavy Missiles I**  
---
*JITA VALUES*  
---
**Cost to create:** 45.64 / missile (at most)  
---
**Value to sell:** 68.99 / missile  
---
**Margin:** 23.35 / missile (\~+50%)  
---
**And the volume is massive:**  \~3m missiles / day  
---
It looks excellent, and you'll pretty much always make money on them. The issue is that the total profits, even if *all* of daily volume is sales, is \~70m / day for the *entire* market split across all sellers.   
---
Or, alternately phrased, if you maxed out a character pumping out Scourge Heavies across 10 industry slots from a perfect station with maxed skills, you are still only turning something like 21m / day profit at most, and likely far less.
---
Only 1 survivor 
---
What is this? 
---
hotshot is the owner and chairman iirc, he stood down from active leadership but he might be back? I dont keep up anymore
---
I'll probably just undock in my Stratios and await the end times in space.
---
If you look under your agency window there are now seeker mission trees that you can do and redo as much as you like.
---
Ok thanks I will have a look ! 
---
If you are dealing with a low volume market the net profit margin goes way up but it isn't really worth dealing with.  For higher volume markets expect the profit margin to be around 0% or less.  I know this seems odd, but manufacturing in null is much cheaper (cheaper costs, less material, cheaper material).  So null manufacturing will generally always beat the at cost price of hisec manufacturing.  
---
There's still time to fix that but it would require a lot of people to pull their heads out of their asses.  We all know what's happening, and we've all seen the end results on Serenity, but we're off having pissing contests with each other instead of dealing with it.  So the Imperium continues to have a free pass to build their power to godlike levels while the rest of us make it easy for them.  
---
At the end of the day none of us are innocent, we're all choosing to let this happen while blaming each other for the mess.
---
That's the only option available.
---
Machs have excellent capacitor and a plethora of fitting slots that make them well-suited to sustained group smartbombing of Havens (ie. tanking each others' damage while repairing cap stable). They have no specific bonus for smartbombing though and are a bit overkill for solo or dual rally points.
---
Good article although its a bit whiny at the beginning bitching about capitals...

The lasers are also on the wrong side, when your ship is above the ore, instead of shooting through the ship, it switches to the ones on the bottom of the ship.
---
&gt; Cost to create: 45.64 / missile (at most)
---
are you calculated production in null or hisec?.  I get 70.87 ISK for hisec when putting scourge heavy missiles in https://eve-industry.org/calc/
---
Maybe not 50% but many are bots.
---
&gt;Except that the average nullkrab doesn't give a fuck about pve in lowsec
---
wanna run that one by me again mr test alliance “passive income is overpowered PL has an untouchable moon empire” please ignore 
---
No one would do porn alts better than /r/eve members. 
---
If they preannounce the End of EVE and after the final Thunderdome were I will waste all Ships I had. I think I would Park my 3 Chars at the Sun of Amarr and await the End, as there is were my EVE Journy started
---
System: Aivonen
---
Last Ship: Sleipnir, 720mm artillery guns and Hornet 2s.
---
probably go out running a lv 4 mission remembering all the CALMIL memories, and the fact that i lived as a carebear for 4 years in Osmon/Outuni before people finally dragged me to lowsec and threw me into PvP. that changed everything and i've been in lowsec/nullsec since.
---
sadly i likely wouldnt be able to if the game were to end today, being that SOMEONE is in the system who shouldnt be.....but with FW dead...no real choice but to accept that.
---
Same place my main has been for the past 4 years, 100km off the NOL station
---
Sansha can be farmed easier than angels imo since the test krab lands  and super umbrella is in Esoteria.
---
Slays: Retriever
---
When I was still a newbro and unlocked my first barge, that system is where I lived for a few months. I befriended all the pirates and industrialists. I'd stay in the main station's grid there with my Retriever on the undock, and wait out my end with fireworks fitted instead of mining lasers. 
---
I'll go to thakala and self-destruct my first capital along with the legacy archon I have there.
---
Then I'm finally free and get my rl back 
---
The fact that battleships in general are pretty shit right now. I would however say medium auto cannons need to be tuned back up.
---
Any of em any good with stratops? Or just moreso mid-level combat?
---
Get a better corp?
---
I would by the $8 salt shaker with amazon prime....
---
Even rolling the dice would be better than going off of membership in a coalition. 
---
How many different playstyles can one player be familiar with? Because I've got alts that do just about everything. I've done just about everything in the game at one point or another. 
---
I will add this to my list - what's the issue with the Nighthawk? 
---
PL hasn't had an untouchable moon empire since the moon mining changes, and we haven't claimed otherwise.  This is a straw man argument.
---
I used to live in hek. I’d probably wait for the end in the kaalakiota station there.  Full circle. 
---
I will for sure be camping in the main stagging of ph looking for fragz in stratiis bomber or t3c lol
---
I would welp every last ship I have docked in Goonspace. I am sure they would be doing the same. Speaking of which, I've always wished there was a purge day were there were no standings and everyone was rogue for just one day. A day where nothing is safe. Ratting in your blinged out Nyx? Good, the whole alliance is gonna fight each other while trying to kill you at the same time. 
---
They’re deployed away and aren’t farming.
---
And revert the Navitas while you're at it. I miss my space fish.
---
It's okay. Pandemic Horde looks like they finally called daddy to come save them. 
---
check if libldb1 is installed, eve runs for me with version 2:1.1.24-ubuntu3
---
Just keep doing it but pvp on the side? If you enjoy it then you'll soon do more pvp and less mining. If you don't, well then you can always go back. 
---
ccp's eve linux client is obsolete, broken and only capable of running directx9  
---
Download the proper windows eve launcher and install with wine. there should be no additional necessary "winetricks" or third party wine tools necessary to run eve with wine in DX11 mode if the wine version you have it new enough.  
---
I've had eve working with dx11 enabled on gentoo using wine-staging builds for almost a year. The only thing that still does not work with dx11 is anti-aliasing.
---
OP says they are renters. Rotflmao. Now that we got the giggles out can OP try to classify them a bit better since he is wrong about their status?
---
That's the problem though, there isn't any/much ISK involved, so I never bother trying it. So easy to just log in, throw my rorqs into an anomaly and do something else. 
---
What this guy said. 
---
Hey I’m in the same boat.  I left before T3 destroyers were a thing.  I’m thinking about jumping into FW for some solo/small pvp.  Want to join me until you figure out where to go?  Pm me if so
---
Can we get citadel skins?
---
Looking in game at a 0 ME blueprint built in Jita with material sourced from sell orders orders. (I'm not including brokers fees or taxes on the sale side though, which will total \~10% of sale price assuming 0 skills and crap standings)  
---
Realistically you could produce them more cheaply, but to my earlier point, what's the point unless you are selling where you are building.
---
I’ll try that now.
---
You just need that one good engagement that gives you the shakes. Then you will never want to crab ever again.
---
There's no need to liquidate and extract your current account. Keep this in mind though - you will eventually realize that your isk amounts to nothing if you do nothing but sit on it for months and just watch it grow. Grinding isk for the sake of grinding isk will burn you out of the game.
---
You have one in delve with space pop. I think everybody can dock here. It supposed to be for people that will retired.
---
Id love to get into it. Any other game I play PVP has always been the focus, I don't know what happened when it came to EVE. Just took the easy road and kept saying to my self "tomorrow ill do this, tomorrow ill do that" and never did.
---
Yeah but then that's a mindset problem, not gonna be solved by deleting your chars. That'll just lead to frustration. Just try and make an effort to pewpew. I assume you're in an alliance, go join their pvp side. If not, join one or go buy a dozen frigs and welp them in FW (tho pretty dead and boring atm) or null (tho you'll probably get a super on your frig). The hard part is finding out where to go, hence my suggestion to join an alliance.
---
Probably why I'm feeling a little down &amp; unsure of what to do, reaching the point of burning out. I feel like starting fresh doing something completely different might get me excited again, but it's a big move to make

I would rather not play eve. That simple

And here I am having lost 5 ships in a day.

And cut off my head while forcing myself to reverse poo

I support the case if they do the same reversion with caldari industrials too, and get back the old designs instead of these abominations.
---
Yep checked 
---
Stainguy cares
---
I remember back when these sites had rats,  and were far more profitable because people didnt do them. I could make a billion ISK an hr on the good days.

Boosting in the public mining fleet
---
they came in with the blood raider capitals
---
you can put corpses in them
---
Oh so that's why it looks like a total flustercuck.
---
4.0
---
Absolutely, get into some fw or see if your alliance has any sigs doing nano roams. You can leave the rorqs afk mining to make us while you PvP. 
---
to be fair, fighting DNG  is among the worst experiences of eve.
---
never seen such risk averse cunts in low sec ever. 
---
never gave a good fight.
---
always flew bullshit comps.
---
always ran when odds were even.
---
fuck DNG.
---
No r/incels?
---
I'd also say that this applies to my allies in the Imperium, too.  Also also my own alliance.  The Imperium, and Imperial Legacy as a coalition, is growing so strong that it's almost game breaking.  At some point we'll need to balance our personal interests with making sure that there are still people to fight left in the game.  I really wish we could get to the point where Goons, Bastion, Initiative, Legacy, Snuff and friends all say "hey, we won, let's mass reset each other and not become Serenity."  
---
Except this is Eve, and based on past experiences I know that would likely just play out as "okay, let's reset Legacy and dogpile them next."  And then after we die it'll be one of the other outer alliances in the Imperium.  And then the next one.  Etc.
---
Similar story here. EVE Online got me into careers in both games journalism and game development. It's thanks to the game that I figured out I have writing ability, can run a business effectively, and have a talent for programming. It even taught me social skills that real life wasn't teaching me, and going to events like Fanfest made me feel like I belonged somewhere. I honestly have no fuckin idea where my life would be if I hadn't started playing this game ~15 years ago.
---
As the other guy said its not the best idea as you tend to be vulnerable and the added effort over a VNI isnt worth it, better to run a second VNI tbh.              
---
               
---
This worked for me back before i knew better in branch but i would not recommend it. I actually ran it fully blinged but there is no need.

Final system: Kinakka
---
Final ship: RR Svipul
---
Back when these ships were retarded OP I had so much fun with waffles. We weren't trying to be the KANGS OF LOWSEC, just a bunch of tryhard-ish nerds having fun roaming around black rise and fighting anyone and everyone. No citadels, no insta-tether, no nonsense. Just pure fun.
---
cloacked untill the end of times. Watching, waiting.
---
Oh RR Svipuls were a lot of fun indeed!
---
You're welcome.
---
r/eve is NSFW, bro.
---
HALF of the interceptors are now NON-interdiction nullified. (I.e. they are now vulnerable to bubbles) 
---
 **Claw, Crusader, Raptor, Taranis** are now things you should try to bubble. (The other 'ceptors are still bubble-immune.) 
---
i have solution
---
install gentoo
---
I’m not saying it won’t but I am needing help to get it working.
---
Not a bad idea.
---
Yup.
---
Yeah, but i can play on my own. Did it in the past that is why i am willing to rent another system now after 4 years of no playing.
---
if anything might be responsible it could be the graphics card driver your using. my gentoo workstation has a 1060 gtx using nvidia binary drivers.  
---
if you have an nvidia graphics card and your using the nouveau linux driver chances are that could be the contributing issue to several graphics intensive applications not working.  
---
The same might be a concern for other graphics cards. The driver used matters significantly.
---
This is what i am looking in this thread, any other you recommend me. any price spread sheet like the old times?

Star System: Thelan
---
Location: Taisu Magdesh's hidden military complex
---
I found this lowsec system randomly back when EVE was only a few years old and settled there with some friends. We mined back when lowsec mining was profitable, mined ice, did missions, and fought local pirate Ginger Magician a lot for fun. The first day CCP added scan probes, I undocked in Thelan and found Taisu Magdesh's hidden static complex. It dealt incredible amounts of damage for the time but it was the only source of Taisu Magdesh's tag, which was needed for the Navy Raven LP offer.
---
It's thanks to this complex that I started spreadsheeting out damage profiles of NPCs and calculating tank based on ship fittings. At the time there was no EFT etc and everyone just used trial and error to find effective ship fits, but I put together this massive tanking spreadsheet and figured out how to tank the site. The tag was worth 250m a pop back when the biggest money you could make was maybe 30m/hour in null, and the boss respawned every 20 minutes so I parked myself at the end of it and farmed it for months.
---
The spreadsheet led me to write a guide to tanking for EON Magazine, which is where I got my first taste of writing and figured out I was good at it (that also got me the job at Massively later). When wormholes came out in 2009, my friends and I launched from Thelan and figured out how wormholes worked. We named our first home in wh space New Thelan, and later it became the first wormhole system ever sold when we found a buyer for 10 billion ISK (it even made the EVE news). Taisu's plex is still there in Thelan, the tag isn't worth anything now but it's a nice curiosity. If the servers were to go down, that's where I'll be.

Interesting things are accomplished when the distro you use also encourages you to learn fundamental linux concepts.
---
No sorry I kissed this in your last post I have the right nvidia driver as mint does this for you. 
---
To be honest I’m alittle lost 
---
&gt; I've been noticing caldari and gallente ships have been the go to for anything PVE lately
---
Well krabbing has become Drones Online for the most part, outside of some early/niche use of missile botes. There's some technical exceptions (the Sacrilege in Abyssal PvE, and some L4/burner blitzing), but that's how it be.
---
&gt; and even in PVP just don't see the amount of rifters you used to. In FW every other frig seems to be an Atron. 
---
Rifters aren't as good as the used to be, and Atrons are actually really great and have been for a couple of years now AFAIK. Even so *the* go-to Interdictor has remained the Sabre for over ten years, probably closer to "whenever 'dictors became a thing the Sabre was always the best". Svipuls are still really good (though personally I don't highly rate the 10mn/dual MSE brawling fit very highly).
---
Lokis are probably the best T3C right now in terms of capability (Proteus is unfortunately kind of shit, and I think the Legion is locked into very specific metas while the Tengu is mostly just a krab machine), and the Jaguar is probably the preferred AF for heavy tackle and to a lesser extent some solo/small gang PvP. Stilettos remain a very strong contender for "best tackle 'ceptor", with only the Malediction as their competition.
---
That said Medium ACs are pretty shit so a lot of the midsize options are generally relying on other- usually fairly specific I think- qualities to be 'good'. Medium arty is still decent AFAIK (insofar as the bitch and a half to fit 720 howitzers is basically cancer, they're still stronk tho), but there's maybe like 4 ships that can actually run artillery and not shit their entire fit.
---
&gt; Also there aren't maelstrom fleets anymore, what replaced that meta? 
---
Not a sov null guy myself, but AFAIK the big fleet doctrines right now are Feroxes, Machs, and then capital/supercapital shit. Feroxes have become favored over arty Canes because there's no *practical* difference in "effective alpha/volley" between the very bursty arty Canes and the higher-DPS railgun Ferox when you're considering your effective alpha to be "damage done from time X where F1 monkeys mash F1 and time Y when reps start to land". For bigger fleets the Logi wing will have to notice broadcast for reps, lock broadcasting fleet duder(s), and then cycle reps onto them. Figure that's like 5 seconds minimum, at which point a railgun Ferox can probably fire 2-3 times compared to once for an arty Hurricane.
---
Machs are actually-mobile battleships. This is a big deal. Also capital/supercap proliferation and the fact that said caps/supercaps are actually more mobile on the operational/strategic level than battleships are.
---
Side note: lots of Minmatar ships are great; T1 'Phoon is a potent RHML kite or torpedo brawling platform (and is probably the best T1 battleship to fit torpedoes to since it won't be quite as papertank as, say, a Raven). Tempest is still a good brawling/kiting battleship since it can bring dual heavy neuts (the practical DPS isn't ideal but dual heavy neuts cover a multitude of sins).
---
Arty Wolf is okay-ish, even if it's totally obsoleted by the arty Svipul. Stabbers are mediocre but I think that's mostly because medium ACs are pretty shit. Cynabals are decent in spite of said shitty medium ACs, same for Hurricanes. Minnie Recons are still super popular because long webs OP.
---
Amen
---
I even have the launcher working, it downloads updates but just doesn’t fire up the game..  
---
look in the Mercenary services channel in game, someone there can assist you there.
---
Focusing on ISKmaking is fine. ISK is important. But insofar as it enables you playstyles you want to access. "Liquidate everything, buy 2500 frigates and go lose them in lowsec" is not the only fun playstyle (although it is one of them), and others might require money.
---
I made my first couple billion ISK in FW. I wanted to buy an expensive ass proteus with slave set to fight in. The Proteus gave me great stories and memories like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3sdsbg/proteus_2v1_soloes_machariel_rattlesnake/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3p9tqb/proteus_6v1_soloes_tengu_deimos_eris_eris_sabre/).
---
The next time I grinded so much money it was to get 6 bombers to multibox for a certain mission. I [developed a method for myself in FW](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFDop_CVaa_bf3515FPXms0N7rOGkdrOc) and turbogrinded another 100b. That in turn enabled [this story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=701vKOcEF-Q&amp;lc=z22wxpqibv3pifzas04t1aokghi1ue0xb2rkxfkurhrkbk0h00410).
---
The next 100b I made in C5 ratting was for a solo dropping Nyx, and to develop my 6 accounts into Pontifexes. The pontifexes gave me [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/97nt10/i_stole_150_excavators_from_goons_in_20_days_ama/).
---
I then made over a trillion with excavator booshing. It was to be able to show to Eve that a single person can steal [that much](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9v0wey/grand_theft_excavators_the_1000th_steal_update/) from the strongest alliance in Eve. Now that I made that point, and got people to follow me, despite being able to make 7.5b/hour, I slowed down my stealing. It was never about money. 
---
You see where I am going with this? With every turbokrabbing episode, I had a non-PvE mission in mind. Money was just a means to an end. An end that was meaningful to me. Without the end, I would quit halfway just because how repetetive and unfun Eve PvE is. Today I am as hungry as my first year for what's next for me in Eve.
---
Take today's generic nullsec turbokrab. He grinds ISK just because his alliance says so. That's not a meaningful end. The only playstyle it will unlock is following F1 orders with a titan in a tidifest. Combine that with the fact that Eve PvE is genuinely boring (perhaps with an exception of Abyss) compared to other MMO's. Then you understand the situation which fellow veteran leaderships of Eve getting other new players in a likelyhood to quit the game, by putting them in meaningless PvE ISKmaking tracks, just because they need people in titans who can F1.
---
That's why one of my side missions in Eve has been promoting independent gameplay.
---
TLDR: Always have a non-money goal when you are making money and you're gucci.
---
Holy fuckin shit
---
Dont even tell that
---
I cant EVEn imagine living in a world without eve

Keep your rorq toons and just start injecting a pvp toon or save enough to buy a focused pvp pilot that you can throw into the pvp wing of your alliance and use your rorqs to fund your pvp. 
---
i'll even give you my gentoo install config templates because i'm not as evil as some gentoo ricers.

I was a little surprised to see a lack of links to furry or anime subs.  Usually the biggest haters also secretly visit the communities.
---
Totally agree on overmoderation though.  Protecting groups from any criticism at all just breeds resentment, everybody has to learn to take their lumps.
---
I've been exactly where you are - got 3 rorquals, planned to get 5, but after the third I realized - why bother? Ended up taking a break for a few months, then came back and dove into J-Space and solo PvP. Definitely a better choice than krabbing day after day after day.

Asheron's Call was shut down unceremoniously a little less than two years ago, WB seemingly just wanted to piss off everyone who wanted to game to continue or wanted to buy the IP.
---
I logged in and conducted business as usual.  Someone was leading a quest so I hopped in and had a good time, I made plans to meet up with an old friend who had also logged in right after, and as I was headed there the servers booted everyone and it was over.
---
That's probably how I'd handle Eve as well.  Just log on, do something I enjoy (likely exploration), and ignore the fact that the shutdown is imminent.  Then when it's over, it's over.  Let it shut down while I'm enjoying it, rather than huddled in fear.

Tell them to come on amok slosh ops, i'll teach them how to fly snowflake hulls and still work with the doctrine :P
---
are you using the steam version? if so try to just use the launcher without using steam to launch
---
Someone once said the celest8s looks like a dong in speedos. Pls redesign.
---
Can't say when, if ever, you can expect those ships. All I can say is that they usually introduce new stuff at fanfests. Anything in between usually is more of a bug fixing updates. I suggest you go watch the last fanfest to, there should be a part where they talk about what they are working on
---
Yes!
---
I came here to say just that. There’s an entire subreddit for StarCitizen refunds. Wow!
---
Aeschee - always has been home, always will be.
---
If anyone is familiar with alts, it’s going to be an EVE pilot.
---
You'll get there, there's a whole art to efficient exploration. Spamming dscan is part of the art and cloaks are extremely beneficial
---
We're you running T2 cover ops or an astero?
---
They arent doing it for the disgruntled f1 monkeys on reddit.
---
They are doing it to try and improve new-player retention by having a nice and simple new player experience guide.
---
No it just does that with this it’s the part after that which is the problem 
---
Ben "Yahtzee” Croshaw said of EVE players that EVE players are to nerds what nerds are to normal people.
---
I’ve been to Fanfest. He was not wrong :-).
---
/Love all you magnificent bastards!
---
If they are spending time on it, it means that they are seeing something on the retention end they like. So I'll gladly close the damn window and tell it to fuck off on every one of my toons if it leads to even one newbie staying in the game long enough to join a good corp.
---
Will go to F-Y5HB or 8P9 in an Astero. Since these are my two home systems when I lived back in Provi and have a special place in my heart. I used to explore a lot and i grew to love the astero.
---
You passed the final test, welcome to the team. 
---
blood raiders like corpses? its a bit of a fun gimmick, opens up some cute lore/RP too
---
the caedes and the rabisu both have one too
---
It's just lore/flavor really, I think the Blood Raider AT ships have them too. The capacity doesn't really matter since the corpse bay is still subject to the item stack limit.
---
if your still trying to use the eve linux launcher the chance of that working and being reliable or useful are futile.  
---
The shared library versions provided by the linux launcher are obsolete versions of qt5 and perhaps a year or more outdated.  
---
Shared library inconsistencies cannot be fixed on precompiled binary linux distros.
---
&gt; since the moon mining changes
---
It’s painfully obvious you read my posts, didn’t understand them, and still don’t know what killed lowsec lmfao. 
---
I’ll spell it out: lowsec is dead because the ONLY reason to fight or live there (moons) got turned into another nullsec pve activity 
---
No I am not I downloaded it and ran from wine and didn’t get the launcher to run at all.. 
---
I would try to find my first wormhole home. It was a crappy C2-C1/HS red giant we called Candymountain. Good times learning wh life with a few friends. Ship: Astero!
---
I really really hope they gonna fix escalations UI on a new one. Since they moved escalations from "my journal" to the Agency, it has been a total mess, as you could not see all escalations, as you could not sort em, and in many cases you could not even know that you are in system with an active escalation, as you might have 12 active and bugged drone roulettes 20 jumps away.
---
How do you think making leshaks cheaper and dreads more expensive would affect things? 
---
I retired in a Luxury Yacht in my favorite system with cargo hold full of drugs, booze, strippers, and corpses. 
---
I've had this problem for ages, I've even disabled 2FA and waited for a mirror but the situation hasn't improved. One of my accounts does not accept the generated token but the other does. You can still log in (last I checked) by starting the client through the server list in the launcher (click the 'E' on Windows, in the menu bar on macOS). The downside to this is skill extractors are disabled unless you log in using the launcher. While that makes perfect sense for Tranquility, it's kind of annoying on Singularity. This workaround does allow me to log in both accounts though, so at least I can use the second one.
---
did you download the windows exe eve installer then try to install eve that way?  
---
You have to use the console terminal to install eve with wine then at least using kde plasma i use the desktop icon to start eve running with wine.  
---
Whichever DE mint uses might have some application icons for programs installed with wine.
---
It’s installed and I have a desktop icon but nothing 
---
CCP has attempted to force every single playstyle to become the “krab and blob and defend” playstyle but that’s boring for enough people that they’d rather stop playing. 
---
Visual team gets an A+ Love you guys :)
---
Really a result of a dice roll say more about the person you voting for that how they hang out with, are you on drugs? 
---
Generally, people tend to stay up to date only with the things they do in the game not everything else, also the lack of daily experience tends to lead them to not even see the impact.
---
Given that all but nullsec and maybe wormholes are in a horrible state, with wormholes are only in a good state because of the corp leaders tend to take the health of the space over there own short term interest. 
---
Where null sec is mostly in a good state because CCP literally balances the game for null sec, with the rest of eve being an after toughed at best.
---
He was supposed to move them away from the edges so they couldn't be used to base attacks from but he sold them to test instead
---
It is, but we wouldn't know till it is tried properly. Like for example you get 5 virtual tshirts, ask your fanbase which ones they like most (not would buy, just like...) and then offer the top 3 picks in your shop. See how many you sell. Or you know put 30 models in and offer the top 20 cause the same company that can print one can print any. And see how many you sell. And you know caps and tshirts are just one thing they already delved into a little.  
---
I'm more interested in actual ship models at reasonably good quality, various sizes, reasonable price. I won't buy many, cause my house is full enough already of things for my son to wreck, but I would buy a bigger model for the house and a smaller one for the office for example. If every one of the 500 active players would do the same they might actually make a profit. I know it is a drop in the ocean compared to the money they need but any money should be good and would help them set the framework for future products.
---
I did start an account a month or so ago training the magic 14, using injectors on him might not be a bad idea
---
I just click "play" and it work on windows.
---
In a Myrmidon, on the Otelen gate in Huola. I would go out being the pirate that I loved being in years past.
---
Nice bait...... #get gud fly what you can afford etc yada yada yada.....
---
Thank you mate, great post. So first things first, I need a goal. I've done so little PVP, I don't actually know what's doable. Ill hop on YouTube, watching some streams and try to figure something out
---
Good to hear you managed to get out. I've seen people multiboxing 10 rorqs which got me started in the first place, just doesn't appeal to me anymore. Trying something new (PVP in my case) seems like the best way to proceed 
---
you are an incel
---
how much experience do you have using linux?  
---
"It just works" is rarely true unless you've customized any linux install for the purpose or hardware linux will run on.
---
I will go to tama and remember the fights the history and one last Grr goons as Falconos snaps his finger and ends eve
---
PGL?
---
Probably jump into a Claw, head to the New Eden system and start burning for the Eve Gate o7
---
still waiting for the second half to be patched in
---
No but actually like that’s just 700mil gone because EVE decided to crash, it wasn’t even my fault lol
---
vespas and Hammerheads have different application. I use Vespas as default for almost everything while Hammerheads for Battleships and Occasionally Harrowing Vedmaks.
---
Hammerheads have some trouble hitting targets smaller then cruiser size in Abyss, so the Vespas outperform them despite the lower DPS because they land more hits and more reliably. In addition, if you fit a drone speed rig and a Targeting Link computer with optimal range (not tracking) script, you can easily do T4s Dark on a blinged Gila fairly reliably, but not T5s.
---
Most of the resistance weakneses in Abyss due to weather effects are not worth switching out drones for. Your Augmented Hammerheads with 3x Faction DDAs will still by far outperform everything else on raw DPS, while Vespas will have best application due to their natural optimal bonus. Valkyries kinda suck, 1st because their DPS is too low to the point where Vespas and Hammers outperform them even in Gamma, 2nd because depending on which target type sometimes they move / orbit too fast and "out track" themselves and actually end up having more troubles hitting their targets then Hammerheads. 
---
The only time Valks or Infiltrators will outperform Hammerheads / Vespas, is when a particular ship type that is weak to the same effect that the Abyss weather debuffs them for spawns, which happens very rarely actually.
---
As for missiles, go with Rapid Light Missle Launchers and T2 missles. You'll have to learn to better time their reload times and DPS but its well worth it.
---
clearly it was - because ccp have stated many times, publicly, that that they won't reimburse abyssal losses.
---
It’s not like I flew before downtime or that I didn’t realize my ship would get destroyed after 20 minutes, it’s just that the client crashed. Imagine if you were doing literally any other activity, your client crashes and when you come back your ship is destroyed.
---
NO U
---
and ccp have already stated they won't reimburse it, from the very inception of the content. - but you chose to do it anyway.
---
you're not specials, the rules apply to you too.
---
they aren't joining as renters.
---
I think its cool :p
---
Fantastic work. Thank you so much
---
I rebound my modules to the number keys, makes it much easier IMO.
---
i have a dream that ccp will announce they are shutting down the servers, everyone welps all their ships and then ccp says "april fools"
---
What DE are you using? Looks amazing.
---
no ur entire coalition + tapi  
---
Look in the wormholes, the effects you're asking for are present in some of them, and they look amazing.
---
Nice video dude, real cool to see dudes going out and making their own content! Keep on keepin on
---
kde plasma
---
Nobody cares
---
"Casino War Criminal" lmao...
---
Arvasaras (Highsec system in Lonetrek)
---
That's where all my toons and assets are, when I don't need them. It's the "going back to" adress, if I switch corps/alliances, it's my personal home, even if I never actually play there, but I always come back, because there's my couch.
---
My last ship will probably be an Anathema, which is one of my favorite ships and perhaps my most used one.
---
Place : KBP7 
---
Ship:Sabre
---
Definitely would hang here and camp dital gate and B-W. Provi was where I first started playing, I have a lot of history there and still some friends along with my father in -7-.  I’d go home one last time and be with the guys I played with for years one last time. As the server timer reaches 0, I’d deploy 1 last stop bubble off of dital just so it will forever remain bubble camped for the noobs in the afterlife. 
---
No no, they won the war. They're refugees not criminals. You're only a criminal if you lose the war. 
---
I've been away from the game for a while because I lost interest. Are there any cool goals to work towards/things to do that could reinvigorate my interest?
---
whomst
---
do you have any more substancial proof than a text paste?
---
screenshots of it in game? 
---
and are you sure he wasn't trolling? 
---
also "harboring war criminal" isn't bad propoganda....its an achievement in eve.
---
though a RMT....yeah that would suck to have, still. due process. give proof!
---
Okay, lets see some evidence for many. 50isk says you got none.
---
Shut up, please. You are no better, and the same can be said about many of the NBI/Landscapers of Horde, like Nidia Masters. You are all a bunch of bullies, assholes. I hate bullies, and I hope many beans jump ship once and for all. We have some very good FCs and people that genuinely want to make the game better, and they don't deserve your toxic attitudes.
---
stop posting Larry.
---
Prolly cuz DOTA is shit
---
Who else?
---
Once upon a time we could copy as many bookmarks as we wanted. Then some long forgotten alliance figured out they could crash nodes by copying thousands of bookmarks across multiple toons simultaneously. The fix to that was 100 bm limit. They then did the same trick across even more toons to the same result, so ccp reduced the number again.
---
Be careful asking to copy more at once, just to  spite you they may reduce the number to just a single one at a time.
---
idk....you might not like it in its final form
---
https://i.imgur.com/ufXnXi0.gif
---
I used to think like that bit now I don't care I just focus on getting skills like getting good bomber skills for PvP/PvP, good gila skills for abyssal etc 
---
Huh, never knew that had happened previously. Pretty shit option when you go to crashing nodes on bookmark copies
---
Imagine being blue with snuff and insinuating that other people are risk averse.  A quick look at our lossboard would probably help dispel your delusion.  As far as "always ran when odds were even", I must ask.  Being in RDraw and snuff pets, how frequently do you arrive on grid to find yourself in such circumstances?
---
Go to a system that r/eve will tell everyone to go to for a final battle, ofcourse. 
---
Must have evaded our extensive application checks.  
---
TBH one of the things that i love EVE for is fact that in this game we have **"war criminals"**      
---
Imagine yourself how immense community have to be to come out with something like this. 
---
your such a attention seeker lol.... 
---
Orvolle gate PF-346 in an Astarte. The glory days of perma gate camps when Orvolle was an actual hub and me and everyone else in ENH/CH would break the camps and makes them our own. Would do it in a geddon if it wasn't turned into a nose/drone boat, but Astarte would be second most iconic ship I used back in the day.
---
I thought the title was a joke, video is literally 7 minutes of shooting vni's
---
Clearly...
---
I do have other proof yes. He openly admits it though...
---
CCP cares
---
You are welcome :). Good luck with the research.
---
My alts will head back to my first real wh home, which we called Avalon. I have the bookmark still from where my pos was. I'll start anchoring an Astra at that bm.
---
My ships will be: 2 nestors, my orca thst survived be rolled out in a c4 (when they only had 1 static), and 3 stratioses.
---
In the last hour, I will launch the billions of isk of fireworks at the anchoring structure. 
---
didn't you already post this?
---
I've never been to EVE Gate, so I guess I'd get my ass out that way. Then, just as the timer approaches 2mins, I'd eject and hit self destruct on my pod.
---
Time it so that the server goes down just a second or two before the self destruct pops. Who knows where I'd wake up?
---
Furries get to exploited like everyone else in eve. No discrimination here.
---
This guy gets it
---
another xenuria thread
---
miniluv is dead, code is like 7 guys who cba do to anything other than kill jfs and freighters
---
Does anyone know if there is an eve map which colour codes regions based on which alliances own which territory? I know there's an in game one but it's pretty terrible, I'm looking for something more like this http://kalralahr.servfire.net/gsmap-large-20070307.jpg but up to date, preferably updated all the time.
---
Thanks.
---
Yes but enemies of the truth tried to silence it. 
---
Considering how often I am in my Crour and Ashimmu, I demand these additional holds in all Blood Raider ships.
---
Never said they didn’t just wondering what I should do
---
would be nice if it didn't lag to shit and wasn't unusable garbage
---
You can do the career missions over, and I believe you can do them for other factions as well. If you have a slot open, you can just create a new char and do the tutorial over, although it's pretty small now and you're not missing much if you remember how to lock, shoot, warp, and dock.
---
Other than that, alphas are free, so why not create a new account and try things from the beginning again. Worst case you have a second account training the basics of you ever decide to multibox.
---
"healer" class
---
There is nothing you can do. If having your client crash while in the abyss was enough to get a reimbursement, everyone would just unplug their router or force quit the client whenever things started to go south. CCP can’t prove you didn’t intentionally crash the client, so they won’t reimburse you. 
---
So what?
---
You don't want to be on comms, you clearly don't give a shit about the defense of the space.
---
Why should anyone rent to you when you aren't going to work with them, 3b a hour for a alliance in the position to rent, big deal it's peanuts. 
---
Just a T1 Heron, I love this ship.
---
And another one!
---
if he does, bring it to horde leadership and let them deal with it.
---
One last hunt,  that's all I'd do.  Possibly an away as well
---
The only feature that sees frequent and extensive reworks since original release is one of the features used least by the eve community.
---
justccpthings
---
stop crying and carry on playing?
---
Ziona, some of my best moments in game were hanging out with dudes in comms, not doing much at all tbh, just chilling in ziona.
---
who should I contact that won't just call me a cunt or tell me they don't care about RMT? 
---
Impressive turnout for both sides, I hope to see more.
---
Get into a pod, point myself into a random direction in empty space, and ride the stars until the end of the universe.
---
some of those marshals are prob worth more than a fitted titan.
---
undock a rev and shoot an npc station / gate and see how long till the guns kill me
---
Dunno. Find someone doing something deep and meaningful and blow them up probably.
---
If the feature is useless wouldn't that imply it's a good idea for them to change it around until it is useful?
---
probably a hold-over from the venture theft.
---
Noice, I prefer a probe or magnate for T1 and then a cheetah for pure explo and a pacifier for exploration and hunting
---

---
[https://sov.space/](https://sov.space/)
---
So CCP must've been aware at the time since they took the money from his wallet, but didn't ban. That's all they did and they still let him play. That doesn't mean that he's still doing it, unless you have proof of him still RMTing.
---
Following this logic can't we just start whining about everyone else that should have recieved a ban, but didn't, even if the offense happened a long time ago?
---
Why are you posting this again? Nobody gave a shit the last time either.
---
Found it. It wasn't the same tutorial back then. Will see how it goes ^^ Wanna join the brave newbies after that.
---
They gave a shit enough to downvote it into oblivion. 
---
Thanks. I found the missions and I never did them ( i played more than 4 years ago ). I will do them to remember and get use to things then will most likely apply to the brave newbies !
---
I think you misunderstand. I am not saying he should be banned. I am saying he should not be in horde. 
---
it's only a war crime if you lose the war
---
That all looks like stuff you get for free from early agent missions, so you likely did some missions and just forgot. 
---
I’m just going to go back to Debian.
---
I’ll work it out the old school way.. 
---
gentoo has been somthing to catch my eye maybe I’ll have a look into it. I hear it’s lush once running. I do waking nights so maybe once I have basic with WiFi I’ll have a play with it on one of my partitions.
---
I know Debian it take abit of time but I think I’ll just rebuild it that way.. to be honest It runs on my Mac so I’ll play it on that. 
---
I hate windows 
---
i'd guess nidia,  but i also don't want them biting my head off....
---
....osrone i guess?
---
Ok ok ! Thanks. 
---
How I find out what to keep in this mess ?
---
A game I used to play the admins decided to reset everything back to day 0 and that took the form of an alien invasion. Giant space ships blew up the world and murdered all the players, you died and got logged out while the admins reset and updated everything. But I was pretty tough and had decent medic skills and a ton of injectors so I survived and the admins had to come down and personally murder me, when they summoned me I managed to run away but they managed to get me back. There was a memorial for me somewhere in the game to mark the spot where the last human died
---
Start enforcing the Code in highsec. Sell a Rorqual, extract the SP of one of the pilots, and use the injectors to quickly skill up one or more gank alts. I'd recommend starting with two.
---
The New Order is an organization that dedicates itself to the percussive education of carebears. It teaches that EVE is a PvP game where player interaction is unavoidable.
---
See http://www.minerbumping.com/p/become-agent.html
---
The "real" answer is that ship insurance prices are based on a percentage of the basic mineral value of the hull in question.
---
Dreads require the largest amount of basic minerals to construct the components that go into making the ship of any capital ship, so they have the highest insurance cost.
---
First Of All, I will be playing this as the server shutdown counter begins: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7uWRtxdhgE
---
I will go to Thera, I will sit there cloaked and just watch as the planets rotate. Watch the beacons of the stations flash. And just sit there staring at the screen as the flashes of memories created throughout my EVE Career race through my mind. Every decision made, every decision, years and years of dedication. 
---
The final goodbye.
---
I kind of hope if EVE shuts down they'll do some kind of battle-royale type thing where over time space becomes more constrained, forcing everybody in the universe into some part of lowsec or whatever. I played a MUD one that would do this with a ~yearly player wipe, and it was great fun seeing all the blinged out characters finally log in to die.
---
So I don't really care where I die, just that I go down swinging.
---
It might be better, after all it couldn't be much worse, I have no objection to a working, functional, and attractive agency, and if it encourages new players to find content, that has to be a good thing.
---
ItS aCtUalLY CAlLeD tHE casInO WaR!!1!
---
Thank you this is exactly what I was looking for. 
---
Start with some baby steps. Look at Spectre Fleet. Many twitch streamers will also do public roams. It isn't super high skill stuff, but it'll kind of give you a feel for a combat situation. 
---
Join a new corp if your current corp doesnt want to PVP, it's always more fun with a few friends. Look into small-gang PVP groups if you really want to learn and be part of a bit more of a tightly-knit community. Don't settle for a toxic corp, find a good learning environment.
---
Wormhole.
---
80% of regular linemembers don't need any justification to do anything against someone else. Not that Horde vs goons isn't already a thing. You're the only one posting about it, why do you even want him removed when you're not on Horde's side anyways? It's not like it matters to you.
---
CCP has not done a particularly good job of building up anticipation for their new releases since 2012 or so. There have been various attempts to improve this over the years (including the updates site) since then with little success. These days, you only hear about upcoming features in the game...
---
* a week or three before they're implemented, either on the updates site or in dev posts; or,
---
* a month or so before they're implemented, via CSM Summit Minutes or CC-sponsored player gatherings (Fanfest in April/May, EVE Vegas in October).
---
As to your specific questions, nobody knows when the next batch of faction capitals will be released. Shield slaves are unlikely to be released any time soon since they would severely unbalance the ship meta across the game, both cap and sub-cap (their release would have to be coordinated with a major revamp to ship balance). Ditto ship balancing in and of itself: this is usually done when a given dev team completes their scheduled tasks ahead of schedule for a release, the timing of which is unpredictable.
---
debian also might not be the adequate answer but it's a good start in the right direction. because debian doesnt provide proprietary software or drivers many things can misbehave with debian.  
---
For simple solutions you might consider kubuntu or fedora
---
Returning noob here, I always start playing EVE for month or two and then drop it. Back again. 
---
My question is where could I find ship fits that are up to date? Eve university fits seem outdated, and i havent learned enough to figure out my own fits. 
---
Started playing minmatar first time, could use couple pve fits for breacher and slasher. Something I can learn skills for in a week/month, and something that I can use right away. 
---
Also want to start on abyssal stuff, since those came out after I stopped playing last time and im excited to run even entry level ones. Are those doable in breacher/slasher entry type ships?
---
My camping perch in E-Y in Provi
---
It does matter and if you honestly think I don't have any stake in the success of new player organizations like horde than I won't try to change your mind. 
---
Kuduntu yes maybe, fedora isn’t that red hats test system. Like when it works there they make it redhat. 
---
The current blob I'm in PVP's, but its more big fleets fighting other big fleets. FC says target X and fire, I press F1 and go to sleep. I think a smaller corp that does a lot of small-gang is the way to go
---
Just remember **it's easy to start PvPing.** Eve is nice in that the player who takes time to prepare to hunt has a massive leg up. Going to PH staging at USTZ prime time? Probably not the best idea. Going to Cobalt Edge (who even goes here?) when all the russians are asleep? No good either, because there will be no content. /u/verybadateve helped me get started Pvping with excellent advice.   
---
Get used to flying cheap engagable ships - arty dual web rupture, nano RLML caracal, neut vexor, suitonia's kestrel, and so forth. However, you don't need to only fly 'basic' ships with their classic fittings (slicer-fit retribution, MSE kestrel) as you can fit a ship however you'd like. Large AC tornado, dual rep retribution, SAAR hull-tanked dualprop kestrel... while maybe not the most 'efficient' ships, they can surprise even the best PvPers.  
---
Try lowsec and try hunting through J-Space as often as you can. Both will provide excellent content, imo far better than burning around in nullsec pinging off intel bots left and right.
---
one thing fedora has in it's favor is support for many features not generally available in other distros. wine staging builds may be one of those optional features.
---
Every downvote is a win :D
---
**SECOND PICTURE**
---
Sell 1 Hacking book, Guristas Copper Tag, Metal Scraps, Spiced Wine, Water, Pyroxeres, Frozen Food, Dense Veldspar, Massive Scordite, Concentrated Veldspar.  
---
Use 1 Hacking book, the Archaeology book, the Industry book.  Right click and select "Inject This Skill" to have them available to train.  If it's already injected then just sell the book.
---
**THIRD PICTURE**
---
Sell all of it.
---
**FOURTH PICTURE**
---
Keep all of it.  Use the Venture to try out mining.  Use the Heron to try out exploration (Hacking &amp; Archaeology skills).  Keep the Merlin and Cormorant for player-vs-player combat.  The Badger might be useful to haul your stuff around, hold onto it for now but consider selling it later if you don't use it.
---
**FIFTH &amp; SIXTH PICTURES**
---
Keep it all.  Buy a "station container" from wherever you're living and use that to stash it.  Those are the modules and ammo you will use on the ships you have.  Different module/ammo setups ("fits") for special purposes.
---
A bunch of horde people are down-vote brigading (something against the rules btw) and then telling me in the comments how little they care about this thread. 
---
Im surprised by the lack of escape from tarkov
---
&gt; when I lived in Providence
---
Sounds right to me.  The Relic sites in Providence (Intact Armor Plates) were one of the few good things about the space. 
---
My story isn't dissimilar from yours, OP.
---
I joined a bit after, at the tail end of the Provi deployment, and didn't manage to catch anything of it, except for the people happy about counting Faction fortizars. But man, I remember the overwhelming feeling L1K1 left me with, and the amazing fights in Y-J. I was in my Vigil for the final timer on the Fort in Y-J, burning pings and painting targets from a distance... and I remember very well the dreaded feeling of seeing that blob of supercapitals jumping in on us, and feeling like everything was going to be lost there and then.
---
I remember Shattered shouting at us to just keep going, and then the famous call to "reship in whatever you have". By then, my Vigil had taken one wrong TIDI warp too many, and I was in a pod, ready to give up. Then I remembered I had a ratting Vexor (Newbro edition) sitting there, to belt rat to raise ADM in the days before the fight to try and help out with the defense. I warped to the Astrahus, re-shipped, and warped back in. That Vexor is still there, in that station. It survived the fight and watched the Fort go down.
---
I missed the most out of UALX: I was working, and got out of it thinking about bad news waiting. Instead, the field was still locked in TIDI, and I only barely managed to get close to it. My contribution to the battle was killing dictors trying to waterboard part of the Goons' supercapital fleet on the way in. I was bummed, but hey, the week after that was pretty interesting. I don't think I'll ever get over how fan was to hear the "Mine! Mine! Mine!" shouted on comms everytime something happened to log in and land in the hellcamp.
---
I've gone on more fleets I can count: be it Stratops, seemingly boring bashing ops (hi there, Simple Farmers o/), the constant brawls with Goons in and around GE-, or the rage pinged Rorq save down in Impass.
---
I don't know if it's BRAVE or what. Actually, for as much as I love it in BRAVE, I believe this to be the experience of many groups all around New Eden. Is just about finding the one that works for you. I like EVE. And I like that one of the corners I call "my home" is down there in Catch, with SBOON.
---
Seems like we might have chances to add more stories to the list soon ;)

All gathered in Kisogo. Right back to the beginning.

Last I checked CCP zapped a few wallets and banned some people. 
---
that's bullshit every alliance have sombody that is not liked by the enemy.
---
Awh...so Jack is a name not a drink. I'm sorry I assumed by the quality of your posting you spent the majority of the day hammered.

Does this also mean that dreads tend to have fantastic insurance payouts commensurate with the initial investment?

Back to Gheth where, a month into the game, I thought I would set up home and do PI.

This post really got me in the feels. Thank you.

Coming back from a ~2 year break.  Wondering how good T3 Destroyers are now and looking for some good uses for my favorite ship (Legion).  I'm probably going to be pretty casual since I don't have a ton of time now to play.  Previously I've been in WH/Null Sec/FW/Low sec pirate and etc.  
---
Would a Legion be usable for like L3 PVE missions, don't remember the ship restrictions.  Last time I was playing I was in a Navy Apoc running incursions.  Actually, now that I look, I'm able to start training Marauders whenever I can get Omega status.  
---
What part are you calling bullshit?
---
fuck off, Xenuria
---
no Xenurias, like DJ said.
---
you can take the price from eve marketer and put it in a spreadsheet.
---
&gt; Interdiction max range is 500km 
---
What does this mean? Not a 'dictor pilot (but eyeing up an eventual dual-prop Flycatcher for solo), and my grasp of bubble mechanics basically amounts to "don't warp gate-to-gate because drag bubbles".
---
How is that remotely announced ?
---
Good times. Long live Puchoco.

Honestly if they shut down the servers they should give us the C6 Thunderdome back - wormholes open everywhere to a single C6, hundreds of connections. Once you enter, you can’t leave, unless you die

Sounds good :)

Any others, just for variety sake?

Damn, that scenario would be rough.

did you by chance record the max/min yield of each rubble/remains/ruins or sites?

Cactus Jack is the an alter ego of professional wrestler Mick Foley. He's had two more personas as well, one of them being Dude Love and the other being Mankind; back in 1998 the Undertaker threw Mankind off the "Hell In A Cell", who plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table.

Well, my main will fleet invite all my alts and with a glass of whiskey in front of me, we'd burn to a ping over Jita 4-4 and watch the fireworks on the undock until the lights went out...

The Evil Flashy Yellow Remote Repper is prepared for Player B's friends/alts/offspring to arrive in their shiny Tengu's and has an Orca alt in warp full of blingy T3s for the Flashy Yellow guy to hot swap into.  In addition there are half a dozen additional Evil Remote Reppers eager for an escalation already aligned each with their own Orcas full of combat ships ready to fight..
---
You can move clones in a clone vat bay on a Titan or a Rorqual....
---
hmm I knew your name was familiar, couldnt remember from where, now I remember.
---
that he exist in horde. i can easy give you goons member that is worse than what you call him. 
---
I never engage in duels.
---
I also don’t believe there should ever be something like a fair fight in EVE.
---
It’s EVE Online, it’s not my friendly pony land. Do whatever the hell you can get away with!
---
I don't know how I feel about CODE. Everyone is fair game in Lowsec and Null, but hisec is a place to learn. I can imagine a lot of newbros are discouraged and quit after being ganked, on the other hand as you mentioned EVE is a PVP game. It's like being thrown into the deep end straight after signing up, ill keep you in mind though, I have to admit it does seem like good fun :)
---
If someone's about to warp to your grid and you popped a bubble before they start warp, if:
---
* their warp path is in-line with your bubble
---
* that intersection point is no more than 500km in front of or behind the destination
---
Then instead of landing there, they will land at the edge of your bubble a few hundred meters in. Bubbles used this way are called "catch" bubbles if in front, and "drag" bubbles if behind. You can use them to make sure an enemy cannot land at something like a gate or station or wormhole, and they can be similarly employed defensively as a measure to prevent warps landing too close to or too far from friendlies.
---
You can also use this distance in anchored bubbles to gatecamp. A small bubble at 499km in front of a gate, and a large bubble at 501km will cause people warping to 0 to be caught by the small bubble. The large bubble won't break their warp--however, since the small bubble is inside the large one, they will end up considerably far inside the large bubble and thus have a very large zone to burn out of before they can warp. This gives you time to catch them, or in the case of cloaked ships, decide whether or not to fight them without having to worry about delays due to sensor recalibration.
---
Make sure you don't leave an expensive clone in a random citadel. If the owner removes the clone bay, forgets to fuel it, of the structure gets into structure, you can't access anymore. I'd suggest the TTT Keepstar in Perimeter, it's probably the safest citadel for clones in all of high sec.
---
Are you in a FW corp?  If so are they accepting applicants?
---
Have everyone online teleported to the new eden system, remove all the wormholes in system, and disable the promised land gate. Last survivor wins.
---
He did but I removed it when dealing with a spam issue. I ended up blanket removing a large amount of threads to deal with it quickly and his got caught up in it. He talked to me about it and I ran it by mod chat (due to bias stuff I can't really approve this kind of thing). They let it go because it was my fuck up that nuked it to begin with.
---
Yesn't
---
Nice job. Did everyone get away from that last NPC? I know it points, webs, hits with cap neuts and has a shit ton of DPS
---
Woot woot rancer Bebe.
---
&gt; Same question for RHMLs Ravens or Typhoons, except for nullsec pvp where I need to serve as my own tackle. 
---
Well as it so happens I've got some recommendations for this:
---
    [Typhoon, rapid jesus kite [grapple]]
---
    Large Ancillary Armor Repairer, Nanite Repair Paste
---
    Ballistic Control System II
---
    Nanofiber Internal Structure II
---
    Reactive Armor Hardener
---
    Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane II
---
    IFFA Compact Damage Control
---
    500MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive
---
    Warp Disruptor II
---
    Heavy Electrochemical Capacitor Booster I, Navy Cap Booster 3200
---
    Large Micro Jump Drive
---
    Heavy Stasis Grappler II
---
    Rapid Heavy Missile Launcher II, Mjolnir Precision Heavy Missile
---
    Heavy Energy Neutralizer II
---
    Large Polycarbon Engine Housing I
---
    Large Hyperspatial Velocity Optimizer I
---
    Large Warhead Rigor Catalyst I
---
    Acolyte II x5
---
    Hornet EC-300 x5
---
    Valkyrie II x5
---
    Standard Crash Booster
---
Precision rounds have \~31 km of range at max skills (projection skills for missiles are fairly easy to max), and give 643 DPS cold; with faction rounds it's \~63 km range and 738 DPS. Lots of fast drones and some ECs for trying to deal with tackle. Pack Crash and use it liberally.
---
Speed is \~1359 m/s cold, a little over 1900 heated. You can swap the EANM to a second nano for more speed/agility and then grab a T2 DC. Potentially this could also allow you to option the hyperspatial to a missile damage rig but if you intend to roam with this then I think the hyper is a better choice.
---
Contrary to brawling fits a kiting nano battleship can make reasonable use of Navy 800 charges since the main things you want to keep running are prop, point, and in some cases guns (for example a nano Mega or Nightmare), and Navy 800s do that just fine while also being pretty volume efficient.
---
With both the MWD and the MJD you can also (maybe, hopefully, assuming you don't get volleyed) moonwalk from carriers.
---
Avoid HICs.
---
For brawling I don't rate RHMLs very highly. The long reload precludes a lot of potential targets primarily because you don't have the sustained DPS to break some active tanks, even with a heavy neut to apply further pressure. Still here's a Raven fit for that:
---
    [Raven, rapid jesus brawl]
---
    Damage Control II
---
    Co-Processor II
---
    Warp Scrambler II
---
    Adaptive Invulnerability Field II
---
    Pith B-Type X-Large Shield Booster
---
    Rapid Heavy Missile Launcher II, Caldari Navy Mjolnir Heavy Missile
---
    Heavy Infectious Scoped Energy Neutralizer
---
    Large Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer I
---
    Large Core Defense Operational Solidifier I
---
    Hammerhead II x5
---
Sadly you do need a (relatively) expensive deadspace shield booster to make this work- dual XLASB fits are just all kinds of bleh to me and in any case chug CPU like a fat kid does cookies. Bring Crash &amp; Blue Pill, and use a large can to pack as many navy 3200s into cargo as you can.
---
Also has mids for days so you can get both MWD+MJD. You can do something similar in a Typhoon but you have to pick between MWD vs MJD- for a missile battleship I think MJD is overall better.
---
    [Typhoon, rapid jesus dual rep]
---
    Large Armor Repairer II
---
    Heavy Karelin Scoped Stasis Grappler
---
    Missile Guidance Computer II, Missile Precision Script
---
    Large Ancillary Current Router I
---
    Large Auxiliary Nano Pump I
---
    Ogre II x4
---
In terms of tank the Raven is a little better (though also reliant on a deadspace XLSB), but the 'Phoon has an application advantage in terms of both the hull bonus and the missile computer vs rigor.
---
Bring Exile, Crash, and possibly Hardshell. That said I think that for a brawling Typhoon you want to run a buffer-tank torpedo fit (primarily because active tank torpedo fits are almost impossible on anything that isn't the SNI, Golem, or Rattlesnake).
---
Just like the previous Perimeter Keepstar? :)
---
CCP has built a sandbox where stability and security is a self-reinforcing equilibrium. Assuming another WWB happened (unlikely), and the goons lost again (very unlikely), then what? Somebody else would be vying for the position of the unassailable fortress. Because the game makes it possible.  
---
Like the goons turtled up to bear in peace in Deklein, then they messed up and got kicked out, so they proceeded to do the same thing they'd been doing, only better. If they were to lose a new war (which, not to put too fine a point on it, I think is super unlikely), then either they or their successor would focus on building Goonland 3.0 with even more turtling and even more security. Just the nature of the 0.0 game, and CCP is like "oh look at all those people busy grinding their ISK, what a hotbed of activity #successfulsandbox"  
---
TLDR goons won, CCP won't do a thing about the meta, let's have as much fun as we can before the game fizzles out.
---
Does he ever play anymore?
---
Nice job but that editing was painful.
---
Imagine being this drunk on koolaid
---
As far as *corporations* I don't know of any, primarily because it's only recently that wardec mechanics got changed so that both parties (deccer and deccee) had to have anchored structures to their names.
---
In any case I'm a big fan of the guys at The Ditanian Fleet; they run armor fleets and are pretty chill. If you join their in-game channel "TDF-Official" then they have a MOTD that links some mailing lists that have all their recommended fits, which includes options with meta4 guns for alpha/low-SP characters.
---
TDF isn't a corp but rather an informal organization but they are pretty cool guys. They are mostly EUTZ though so if you're in a different one they may not be a great fit.
---
They do get Leshaks though. And Leshaks are great (and basically impossible to shield fit).
---
Yes, the drifter! It's hard to see in the sped up video, but shortly before destroying the final dread we primaried the drifter so he wouldn't properly swap to anything we didn't want him to. He died moments before the last hostile :)
---
That is a very unique opinion you have there!
---
This is what i would do too. I have flown with TEST for 2 years, i can't imagine ending that anywhere else.
---
People complain so much, because they are either on the right side of the economy, and nobody wants to fight them anymore, or on the wrong side of the economy, and they are constantly getting shat on. And since the economy is this hentai-ish kraken in EVE that just influences EVERYTHING, this carries over to almost all section of the game.
---
I hope eve dies one day so we can see what happens with ur life tbh.
---
The Molok (Blood Raider titan) should use corpses as the fuel for its doomsday weapon.
---
I would go to either Korsiki or F-G7BO. 
---
Korsiki was the home system of Eve university when I first started playing so I spent the first 6 months or so based there and without those guys I doubt I would still be playing.
---
F-G7BO was the home system of The Graduates when they were in Morsus Mihi. Flew with them for nearly a year and a half and got involved in the my first big fleet fight, my first capital fight and got my first titan kills in Y-2ANO. This was what got me hooked on the nullsec life.
---
&gt; I also don’t believe there should ever be something like a fair fight in EVE
---
That's why you ship scan your target with an alt before proposing the duel.
---
Nah I fly solo at the mo due to RL, I was in FEDUP but they moved to nullsex. But there’s still a few around like Gallente’s Villore Accords (alliance) and Caldari’s Heiin Conglomorate who are pretty active, do small fleets etc, and plenty of smaller ones. Sure they are all accepting apps. Lots of isk to be made in FW but I prefer staying neutral for more targets. 
---
The grand irony is they all have krabbing alts in GSF. 
---
Your stake in the success of new player organizations like Horde? Personally I haven't heard a single word about you, at least when it comes to the success of Horde.
---
But like I said, you don't need to feed linemembers propaganda to make them shoot someone. It's enough for the administration to tell them that they're going to ;)
---
Razor
---
So you're not in FW you're just doing PvP in the beacons then?
---
I would love to i left about the same time. What's your in game name is love to join up who knows maybe we make our own Corp 
---
Only undock what you cannot afford to lose. 
---
  This will change your eve experience.
---
Absolotely yes, I learnt as much in my first month in a small wh corp as I did in a year in nullsec
---
If you think this will help player retention you are so beyond delusional. Does nobody here actually understand why people play in and stick to it????????????????????????????? I actually feel like I am taking crazy pills, jesus fucking christ. WE HAD 50 K AVERAGE LOG ON in 2009-2012 WHEN TUTORIAL AND NEW PLAYER EXPERIENCE WAS UTTER GARBAGE.............................................
---
There's just simply no reason for that. A "freeport" is just a staging your enemies can also dock at. "Honor system" my ass.
---
In a Drake.
---
In Jita 4-4.
---
Yup. Both warzones are very skewed at the mo, and the LP stores need reworking (galmil LP pumping out vexor navys for example), also it doesn’t seem like many corps are making a big push, at least in the gal/cal zone. Some say citadels destroyed the desire for rival groups to fight for control of systems. 
---
But there’s lots of isk to be made if you do, and it’s great training for pvp, FW or neutral. 
---
you're mentally ill
---
How many were stabbed
---
I mined.. once. Learned a fair amount of stuff, made my first bil and helped quite a lot of newbros myself. Tbf i am playing this game since 2016. Only got into null a year ago, so that still counts, yes?
---
EVE being a cold, inhospitable world that will eat you up and spit you out if you don't HTFU shouldn't be unique. 
---
I'd probably die in whatever system I was in when I left three years ago.  
---
But, just for the sake of argument: If I did choose to resub and be there for the end I would probably have to go home to Tama. 
---
High tracking crystals and hybrid charges pls.
---

---

---
Assuming I can sweet talk a GM into it, getting someone to teleport my high-sec Phoenix from Stacmon over to Amarr. Then /u/ChribbaX and I can have an epic dread-on-dread showdown.
---
Barring that, I guess I'll put some proper guns on the thing and go wreck as many Upwell structures as I can before the final moment...
---
Yes, highsec is a good place to learn that nowhere is safe. If you prefer, you can simply pick targets past a certain age, or whatever criterion works for you. Ganking is a lot like fishing. I like to go after exhumers, myself, which are generally flown by older and richer pilots. If somebody does quit because of a lost ship, I reassure myself that I spared them a good deal of time in realizing that they weren't cut out for EVE.
---
I ended up taking a break from the game due to mining. When i came back i extracted all my mining SP and put it into combat ships and exploration ships. Kinda regret it but it forces me to stay off mining.
---
Unless of course it involves hAtE sPeEcH!
---
I'll go back to my first home in oimmo maybe and sign off there.
---
but.. but.. StainGuy said wormholes were risk free! 
---
You forgot where someone gets reimbursed because he lost to one of the new ships that isn't on his overview.
---
There aren't fair fights, really. Hence the flashy yellow logi and friends killing them and etc.
---
Well yeah. I've been around eve for like 13 years.
---
I have been in TEST for 2 years, I can't imagine going out anywhere without my TEST bros.
---
Make enough isk that you don't need to make or worry about isk anymore.
---
Note that this can mean you finish the tutorial and that's good enough, or it can men you are krabbing for years.
---
I don’t believe it is.
---
I did not mean to make an earth-shattering observation.
---
Cool Story Bro
---
User Flair checks out...
---
&gt; Money was just a means to an end.
---
I'd argue, base on your descriptions anyway, that sometimes it was only incidental. You weren't booshing excavators for the money so that you could then afford something different. You were booshing because you wanted to, and the ridiculous payoff was "just" icing on the cake.
---
Yeah, like they're going to admit to being renters, they are demoralised enough as an alliance
---
Maybe you should read the CSM meeting mins from my term or listen to any of the interviews I gave. 
---
There are good corps?
---
I'll take the tarp off my cloaky Proteus, find a low-class wormhole and log off near a Lava Planet.  
---
It is. Siege your dread.
---
Link the kill! I see c5 dreads somewhat often. I roam solo tho, so I just sit and wait for the idiots that bring out the bling salvage Noctii after running the sites.
---

---

---
Former banker here, can confirm the major bankers had ALL their characters wallets zeroed...the rest of us bankers just had our banker wallets zeroed.
---
Minmatar have the best blob and smallgang ships in the game.
---
Muninns are the best HAC and break fleet meta so hard that you may as well not use anything with a laser. It’s pretty difficult to understate just how gamebreakingly strong the muninn is but the fact that people are basically obliged to only run arty or rail comps in order to be able to deal with muninns should highlight the issue enough. They’re also VERY strong roaming ships either shield or armor fit 
---
Lokis are really good in smallgang (mwd arty) and fleets (armor web utility or AB arty comps)
---
Jaguars are probably the best tackle in the game because they have the benefit of being extremely tanky, extremely fast, and anti-laser ships.
---
You don’t see too many maelstrom fleets now because they’ve been replaced by megathrons, apocs, (because they cycle faster and hit further) or HACs
---
&gt; you can't access it anymore.
---
Actually, it gets destroyed.

Tell your tard wrangler you need help

You'd actually be ahead to start a new character. You'd have more skill points, you could just transfer all the items via contract if you don't want to be out of 8mil. Do the tutorials all over. Do the career missions all over. Then maybe do the SOE arc. Should probably join a newbie corp to learn the basics as well.

---
Plus even more than that. Heretic/devoter are significantly better than the gallente counterparts for most purposes, punisher is a great cheap frigate platform, pontifex is used extensively in most armor fleets nowadays, harbinger navy and zealot are both very competent small-gang ships, revelation, avatar, and apostle are the most common ships in their class and the archon really isn't that much worse than a thanny. The days of the ubiquitous 180km apocs and armor hac zealots/legions might be behind us but even horde recently adopted a mainline apocalypse fleet comp. 
---
Amarr is somewhat inflexible which means they're not seen in every fleet but they have some extremely strong ships within their classes. 
---
