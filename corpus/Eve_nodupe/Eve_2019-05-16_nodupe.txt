That's actually not what I meant at all; Right now boosting ships - such as the porpoise, orca, and *rorqual* get a ship bonus to the amount mining drones do, and also get a bonus per level of the ship skill.
---

---
If I was going to make one change in eve, I think removing that bonus - making them all but entirely reliant on boosting a *fleet* rather than solo mining as I see many *do* would be a good thing.
---
I'm sure this would be an incredibly disliked change for a large amount of people, but I think it's necessary.
---
---
---
Yeah, people talk a lot about a 'culture of botting' or whatever, but I think that's mostly nonsense, and probably a bit racist as well. If you were poor and could pay even a modest percentage of your bills by leaving your computer running when you're at work, why wouldn't you? It's not like botting or RMT are actually illegal, they're just bad for the games they take place in.
---
The players do what they do because of the mechanics. The combination of rorquals printing initially 200/hr in raw minerals tabbed out and supers being a massive fuck off sphere of kill everything incentiveizes joining the biggest group. Simply put, if you're a highsec miner why join anyone but goons?
---
I mean, i'm all for letting people handle their own money. 
---
But didn't you kinda prove their point? What difference would it have made if they had ratted in more expensive ships other than juicier killmails for you?
---
So why have that option if log off does the same thing but without a timer?
---
IIRC, they fixed an exploit which allowed you to use skins you didn't own. Yes, something about this 'fixed' cloak+mwd not to work, which actually turned out to be unintended behavior.
---
... But, since that unintended behavior has been so widely used for so long and by so many people, CCP deliberately undid the skin fix, then fixed it again in such a way that cloak+mwd - among other silly things you can do just after cloaking - actually worked as expected.
---
Holy shit Paco I remember you
---
Jokes on them, we were actually going after PHorde space.
---
I'm not sure how they work these days, but i don't think badfellas paid rent. They later consolidated the badfellas "militia" into the BoT main alliance but i don't know if they turned them into renters.       
---
I always assumed the remnants of Badfellas were target of BoT CTA pings etc.
---
Good read, agree we need more npc stations spread around nullsec to kill these fucks.
---
&gt;and regular sex
---
wow that was cringey
---
You can watch yourself log off and be sure you are actually safe.
---
No. Have you watched them run? I have 
---
The dread was in site. I was logging on a sabre to bubble it, while my dreads were aligning down to him, when he Warped away
---
Dread was firmly in site, not hunting the drifter.
---
People forget the jita riots. The players didnt want walking in stations garbage. Especially when it launched with only allowing us to walk around one tiny room.
---
I love that Eve has Finnish wormhole corps composed of alcoholics.
---
this is wrong because nobody uses orcas in nulsec
---
“Waterboarding is a thing I promise you, and when we figure out what that is we will tell you”
---
Do exploration in null or wh space and make dank isk.
---
*100000000000%*
---
This hits all the high notes, especially with that whistling
---
Botters welcome!
---
Problem with hauling for newbies is the collateral is so much. Most don't have that much or want to risk it if they do.
---
Some say that bashing structures is just another form of mining for them...
---
Exactly. 
---
So, OP, don't do this. 
---
One good relic can can give you 35m.
---
How has this not been made as a rebalance suggestion before?  Someone should make a (hopefully good) standalone post for it
---
i didn't have an issue reading it, but it wouldn't be a bother to have a few more seconds
---
Looking up his reddit name on zkill gave me a character with 3 times your recent zkill history. Using the total number of kills you have been on is unironically the least useful indicator statistic on zkill with the possible exception of total isk in kills.
---
This is a good suggestion.
---
to clarify, you watch yourself log off and disappear from space and local with 'safe log'. the other one you are still in space up to a minute or something like this
---
But most nullsec players like local. If they did not, they would move to WH space. Deleting local would piss off a lot of people and cause them to quit, not something EVE can afford right now, especially over such a bad change.
---
To see it or the eye removal surgery to unsee it?
---
Forgot to also say freighters were waaaay cheaper when I got my first one, but you can start this with PushX and smaller transport vessels, just watch out for more gankers
---
And it will bring many old pvpers back because suddenly the game is risky and exciting and hard to play again
---
Haters gonna hate :P
---
Time to follow the urine trail.
---
Would you prefer he had irregular sex
---
You could argue drone droppings were better than actually mining, that was a change i wasn't super fond of.
---
Punctuation my dude
---
They're currently not allowed to use any shiny ships, despite paying rent to live there in the first place. Having to have significantly lower ticks but still pay the same amount of rent
---
Mining drones suck, not matter what you are flying. My Rorqual (which is for sale btw) has never used a mining boost charge. Most don't, because excavators can't use them.
---
Porpoise sucks all around.
---
Orca is a big fat loot pinata.
---
considering hes a bee id prefer he wouldnt reproduce at all
---
Where are the rorquals?
---
NCPL on and off have always required multiple toons, it won't be much of a problem in this hypothetical situation. If you had a supercap you had to have a separate fax alt on a different account (which is why fax numbers are amazing in NCPL). You always had a subcap main, also usually on a different account. You frequently had a dread toon or two for dread bomb shenanigans. NCPL is very alt-heavy. Most corps seem to have reduced their requirements to help with blob warfare, but it's still made up of mostly those older players.
---
&gt; Without proper infrastructure, ratting, mining, and industry in null becomes a far riskier endeavor. 
---
So nothing that NCPL care about anyways?
---
PBUH
---
Don't know if therabois are still a thing, but between nog8s, Volta and friends you always had plenty of people rolling the holes to get to those juicy renter regions too, it's not like we passively waited for them. Thera is a ton of fun to stage from, especially if you're a small group just interested in PvP.
---
You are in luck, neither does NCPL! :D  
---
We can all win EVE together.
---
Doesn't pass the sniff test
---
Explo is far less than what I currently make.
---
They still run ingame events from time to time. Think there was one in January or so? Was a real PITA because effort vs. reward was badly balanced and the sites were wonky or something. Think you had to mine special goo to make boosters?
---
There was also a rather decent if simple event shortly after abyssal space got introduced where you got rewards for running abyssals.
---
What I would really like to see is drifter-style incursion events. They worked really well for a mix of both new players and older ones and would be well suited for event-style shenanigans. Not actual incursions obviously, just event sites similar to what used to be the drifter incursion sites in conjunction to the newest form of agency event missions.
---
lmfao dude you have no life other than rolypoly'ing around r/eve habitually posting with the same gimmicky failed debate strategy like a damn poor-man's philosopher who paint's their opinions on the walls of abandoned warehouses with fecies: 
---
**Step 1:** Completely overlook, mis-interpret, and misunderstand a comment then \~*attemp a completely random sick burn that self implodes due to it's terribleness and vile stench of jealousy with a tint of "notice me!"*\~ that's most likely based on Olmeca's imagination land reality. Criticize the other person.
---
**Step 2:** Once failure of Step 1 occurs proceed with throwing together bits of consciousness and cherry picked words, sometimes related to EVE, in a loosely coagulated stew of counter-argument nonsense similar to what you would find a crazed homeless alchemist creating in a roadside porto-potty. Once compiled, run through thesaurus, add words from philosophy wiki. Play the victim, elaborate on how others are mean.
---
**Step 3:** When Step 3 fails double down on Olmeca imagination land reality and establish schrodinger's reasoning for any and all things even when facts are clearly demonstrated and documentation is provided. Claim some random non-affiliated thing happens in imagination land that can not be proven and impliment this as the direct reason why Olmeca is right. Do some sort of rain dance and talk about danks isks and excavators. Goons are dead, Olmeca killed them. Write a lot of words from thesaurus so that it's more noticeable and people pay attention. Criticize the other person.
---
**Step 4:** When Step 4 fails suit up with tinfoil armor, triple down on argument, create additional flawed arguments derived from imagination land facts. Impliment theft of opponent's jokes / arguments / reasoning and re-use them as fresh original content even though it was literally used a couple lines up. Overload hypocrisy. Establish Olmeca is ruler and god of imagine nation land. Play the victim, elaborate on how others are mean.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You're fucking bad lol.
---
I mean, if the requirement is being finnish, yes.
---
finland is composed of alcoholics :o
---
25? have you watched incursion multi boxers recently, it's now 2 golems 2 nighthawks and 36 local tank sentry rattles running HQs.
---
There is an inner core of corps calling themselves "Order66", like you said it's a militia from previous Droneland alliances who are given the task of being "guard dogs" over Malpais and The Spire, who get to live there rent free in exchange.
---
I made a comment in a thread like this the otherday, curious did you read it or are we simply thinking on exactly the same lines?
---
My other thought was add in more "thera" wormholes, except have them locked to a certain type of pirate (and also have far less connections).
---
&gt;This will give people motivation to fight off the incursions instead of farming those.
---
the people farming them and the people that have issues with them are different groups and I don't see red frog and niarja gankers as likely groups to work together to run the kundalini.
---
Correction. Many of us don't have to make ISK like the average goon member. There are quite a few 1% of the 1% in Panfam, and many of us never touched the dirty belts.
---
the bots are using sentries? that's weird.
---
You do pay concord for your sov though, and concord is closely related to the 4 empires.
---
Yes , they go to lowsec
---
Where from?
---
Only taking spys at the moment but stay tuned #TM
---
I agree
---
It could also open up more fronts for small alliances and coalitions, though you would have to do something about ease of access.  For example venal and great wild lands are far harder to roam out of than Stain.
---
We proved many big fights ago that the titan battle is one thing, but having the subcap force to support it is another. A smaller entity can't "win both" against more vast numbers.
---
A good way is supplying your alliances VNI drones that has specific damage types that rats least resist. Just type pve eve online rat resist and i think eve uni comes up showing the rsts in your region. Then supply the market eith faction and tech II drones for the vexor navy issue
---
i have told this like a million times by now remove omist and cobalt edge because obviously CCP doesnt know what to do with npc null (syndi, curse etc) so creating new space is out the window . Give ppl time to move out hit delete mend the routes easy . when ccp figures out what to do with npc null we can introduce back these regions with npc sov in them.
---
You could learn a thing or two from Goons tho.They didn't even deploy and had a more successful campaign than you guys.
---
haha why is this only 74% upvoted
---
Are you proud of dropping supers on something you could probably kill on a rorqual?
---
VFK by Christmas....YES YOU CAN! Dead Coalition is recruiting! Get good rates on VFK and all ex Slyce space, rental - lease - rent-to-buy options also available. Terms and conditions apply.

Hey roo when you coming back to the stream? I tried following your discord, but the link is expired.
---
Incursion fleets survive the kundalini which involves ECM bursts, ECM burst the logi (who anchor by orbit 15km in a wtm fleet) and you probably kill 2 ships before they reastablish the chain even if you time it perfectly (5 seconds after logi breaks invuln in a preload TCRC)
---
Wow this is too long for me to care mate. Let the hate flow thru you tho
---
It’s a parody
---
Bait smells fishy.
---
Didn't they pull drifter incursions because a bunch of people were making like 5b an hour in disposable ships doing them? then change them so they paid nothing and no one did them.
---
I mean, just because you coughed when you had strep throat doesn't mean every time you cough in the future you have it again, it could just be a cold this time.
---
You say that like it's a bad thing. All we've had for content since the peace with TAPI is bashing UA structures uncontested.
---
It was never the plan to kill the goon alliance..... This narrative oddly evolved.... Were we supposed to take a page out of the mitten book of "Love Penifsmash" and recruit y'all?
---
Oh come on, surely you can do something here Naz....please.
---
well goons did it for x47 and they even won while attacking on a keepstar which give free cap etc

howa about removing the sand from your vagina
---
No. There's only one Sort in Eve.
---
"If only they had more allies ..."
---
Why? Test have plenty of allies and got smashed on your northern deployment.
---
I'd just like to point out that despite all the shit Darkness and Dead Coalition gets around here, we faced Goons for a year without running. NancyDock and Pandemic Fleegion unanchoring their shit and running ***before Goons even start invading*** is one of the most gratifying things I've seen so far in my Eve career.
---
It's only those with blues laughing, thinking we like their sheep mentality.

That would go against my point, you have to choose between income or defence.

Nice job andy )

Yeah it's hard work getting to be a goon pet.

yeah, but how do i know where the bots are?  asking for a friend.

It wasn't the alliance dickwaving it was individuals in the alliance dickwaving and relying on the fear of the pl super fleet to get away with it. 
---
The pl super fleet was always more feared than it needed to be. I've been in fights both for and against them and they have lost multiple times. 
---
Problem with this war is you have one side with 2,3,4 full fleets of titans. Nothing anywhere in eve can counter that.
---
but C++ is a bad programming language
---
I mean, there's nothing next to the Great Wildlands to roam to. Etherium Reach, Insmother, and Scalding Pass are quiet or dead
---
Better than the multiple dead sotiyos for sure.
---
yes im aware
---
A botting program would work best, and go undetected longer, in space that has few people. That is the opposite of Delve. Our ratting drama is only rivaled by our mining drama.
---
3/10

&gt;  LadyScarlet were doing stretches on the 200m running track.

lol
---
The irony as your alliance of 5000+ pilots, snuff (1500), FXR (500), Bastion(3200+), etc, has been blobbing sub-500 toon groups in Pure Blind for 4 months with double or triple the numbers, all on behalf of local russian botters living out of npc stations. And when you can't outnumber the local groups 2:1 because panfam come to equalize, you batphone daddy goons and blob out timers with 1400 guys. So yeah, no sympathy.  
---
GF's tho
---
That's certainly true.  However, you mentioned that there was a reduction in account-plexing cost in March, and there's a day where the amount of PLEX being traded doubled overnight on March 29.  It's a single blip that decays back to approximately baseline by April 1.  There's no way that's an increase in regular trading!  (Ironically, some of the people rush buying plex to feed it into their account likely screwed themselves, because that's a 5% cost reduction, but they were paying as much as 10% more.  Of course, they weren't going to know if the price was going to go back down afterwards.)
---
Unfortunately, I'm failing at Google, so I can't find the promotion you mentioned to check if that's the right time frame.
---
Doesn't renting imply some sort of recurring payment?
---
I agree. I've always loved NPC regions and how they can be used strategically. It always seemed like there weren't enough in the east. All there is is curse and its right next to highsec so its kind of useless as a staging area for hunting.
---
Make sure to dm with any rental inquiries
---
Bring back the gong!
---
I would have bought a guristas sweater if it wasn't legitimately over $400 after shipping. I guess hilmar had to walk it to my house personally?
---
CCP is one mismanagement clusterfuck after another, let's not pretend there's any other reason. People would have been fine with walking in stations if they'd gone about it in any sort of rational way, like developing it alongside EVE as a seperate project when they had \~700 people in the company, instead of dropping eve like a hot potato for almost 2 years then top it off by charging $70 for a fucking monocle in what was essentially it's alpha test.
---
Should take the next leap and move to a c5!
---
Nah boys, Sid from titanfall as a Aura voice, I would ironically pay 50$ for
---
You seem mistaken on one part. Plex prices was climbing at a nice steady space until about 550mill, then over the course of 60 days jumped to 800-880mill each and stayed in that range for some time. There was no reason for the surge that could be seen. No ended of sales, no creation of sales that suddenly demanded plex's, aurum was still a thing, there was no AT event, no plex for tickets event. nothing, just a sudden surge.
---
Almost as if somebody bought out the plex market and relisted.
---
It was only after the 1:500 split that it climbed to 950-1bill range. THEN it just kept increasing in isk price at a far faster rate than it was before the pre-550mill days.
---
Log off safely requires you to sit still in a site for 30 seconds to completely remove you from space and local, in which that time span after 10 seconds the rats will attack you and fuck up the process.
---
Log off will do the same thing, but only if you have NO TIMERS, not in a fleet, have no mods active, and don't move when you land. It will automatically warp you to a safe and remove you from local and dscan.
---
again sorry lmao. next time will be even longer text.

You must be omega to get the reward. Omega cost a sub. Therefore it is not free. End of story. Jump as many stupid hoops as you want. It's not free.
---
Their most recent events have all been awful; I normally log on for them, but they haven't been worth it at all.
---
We're supposed to be getting some new abyssal-themed incursions. We'll see how doable these are for 'normal' peeps. It would be cool if they have a bunch of new scannable sites for people who don't want to / can't invest so much time, effort, and money into running the overarching incursions.
---
Virtual machines run roughshod over this idea. While a piece of software might be able to inspect Ring 0, the host of a virtual machine represents a theoretical Ring -1, and no software can tell if it's running on real hardware or on a virtual machine. Cory Doctorow wrote a fun little short story partially about this.
---
That might cause the system to ban hundreds or thousands of players who use the same out-of-the-box hardware, though. Not to mention that such systems have historically, when used as part of DRM, had a sub-par accuracy. There's enough of an issue with player retention without people being randomly banned because the anti-botting system fucked up.
---
Thanks I'll check that out. Just curious how do you control specific drones I want to launch a group of combat drones then salvage drones after the fighting but only know how to do it either the launch drones which launched salvages too or manually for each drone.
---
Every one keeps saying that but I dont want to loose my ship I cant afford to replace it yet.
---
I agree.
---
This 100%.Game would be so much more risky
---
Have you tried not being shit? Sounds like projection to me.
---
Anything can start the unanchoring timer at any time with no consequences until it actually finishes unanchoring. That timer can also be reset indefintely. So this could just be a little bit of ruse.
---
hahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
I distinctly recall buying some PLEX in 30 day token form at around 900M and wondering whether I should sell it when the sticker price exceeded 1B, so I'm pretty sure you're mistaken about the price.  I also remember it going down a bit a couple months later when input broadcasting was banned.
---
You also seem to think this disagrees with me, but I don't think it really does.  The old one-token-for-30-days PLEX was priced based on expected earnings of a certain kind of player over those 30 days.  Prices were somewhat sticky, because expectations were sticky, but that's part of why it was stable.  After the split, PLEX value was no longer so tightly coupled to the value of a subscription, so it adjusted to approach the value of anything that can be bought with hard currency.
---
It's possible you could flesh out the sticky price argument more to support a claim that the fundamental value of PLEX and the price of PLEX had diverged significantly before the split, but I'm not convinced so far.
---
One year of BM sharing... I know WHer are crazy, but you guys are off the chart!!!
---
Or something; either way the astrography of the constellation needs to be such that logistics into it is feasible.
---
Lady Scarlet would win that race if it was downhill
---
I...
---
...what?
---
that is the unmodified attribute. Simulate or pilot it and you will see the 300% warp speed bonus apply.
---
Thank you for that great offer.  I've kept mine in prestine condition too, but you never know, maybe they were damaged over time.  
---
The hard part will be making the type legible.  It was so tiney.
---
Thanks for the information.  I'll look them up and ask for permission.
---
I'm sure the Detroit autocorrect qop unintentional but it sure fits
---
No it has bonus to warp speed. 300% should be listed on trait screen.
---
&gt; step 2. go to renter regions
---
Which be they?
---
As far as I am aware
---
I doubt that will offset the losses. EVE can't afford this kind of change, especially when the issue can be solved in a much better way. Nullsec always had local, something else changed to make it less risky, deleting local is not the answer.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

I especially liked the Hel drop on the Caracal too :)
---
huh. Means they have to actively target rats, and can't use alpha accounts. CCPlease.
---
I give it a week before trig incursions are untouchable "legacy code"
---
Even if thousands of people bought the exact same system from Dell, there is no way their Hash codes would look the same. Every device has a different serial number, or MAC address, or whatever kind of fingerprint their manufacturer assigned to it. You run the NIC MAC, and the HDD Serial, and a few other numbers pulled out of various settings, all through a Hash... And you'll come up with a unique fingerprint for that machine, and that machine alone.
---
so does normal log off, but you get a 1 million km safewarp first
---
Downside would be, if the Virtuals don't give enough values for the Hash, then the software would end up banning most Virtuals b/c they end up looking the same. In which case, CCP could just say "stop playing inside cheap Virtuals". =)
---
They only care that people buy plex. The game itself is irrelevant to them.
---
Yes, and also provide and incentive for invasions and conflict with loot as a reward. How it is in whs atm and it's great.
---
Remove citadels.

Capitals are not the end-game content for a lot of people. Black Ops, Marauders, high-level industry, or blingy wormhole doctrines are all very much end-game goals.

Whats wrong witb my posting history.
---
It was always really hard to catch ratters, nullsec was more active before because people decided to fight voluntarily back then. Now people dont voluntarily decide to fight, so we have to change the mechanics so that krabs die. The worst thing they can do is make no drastic changes and just ride the slow player number decline all the way to zero
---
Alphas get rewards as well. Omegas get more rewards. Are you paying your omega purely to get more rewards? That's pretty fucking dumb.
---
While it would be nice it takes development time away from actual issues so please no.
---
That's always the excuse... but how many "actual issues" get fixed? And how many get ignored in favor of making ~~Sansha~~ Triglavian Incursions, and World Tour SKINs, and 16th-anniversary ball caps and t-shirts?
---
They can spare a little bit of time to touch up what's already there, and been there for 16 years. There will be plenty of time to fuck up "actual issues" later too. =)
---
Turbokek
---
How you gonna put stations there? What would they do just randomly list from side to side as they float off into nothing?
---
And yet there is absolutely zero proof and people that have defected from co2 even stated they wernt doing shit. Regardless goonies left them to hang so it would have been well earned anyways
---
lol the NC model isn't nomadic, it's being slumlords. owning the biggest chunk of space that was convenient and renting to botters and idiots. and if you had to give it up you could say it wasn't really "yours".
---
(not judging, it worked for a solid decade and kept you in rolling in titans for minimal effort. but times have changed and NC didn't adapt.)
---
I have a corp of 8 or 9 real life friends, with a mix of a couple alts on some of them.
---
If we wanted to find an Alliance in null or wormholes, would they take us as a corp under the Alliance umbrella, or typically should a corp be larger? Does it matter?
---
Iteration is a dirty word in Icelandic.
---
I was 3 months or so in game, belt ratting with some blue nerds I didn't know in Geminate. We caught a Dread Guristas spawn that dropped a Rattlesnake BPC, which was worth 2b at the time. I got to the wreck first and told the nerds that it was ammo and tags. This was back when a billion ISK was a lot. I invested it pretty well and I've been at least modestly rich ever since.
---
Yeah, but if CCP were to just use the hash codes then all a botter would have to do is change a single thing about their computer and that would be that. Literally swapping the RAM might be enough to make the system think it's a whole different computer. This creates a tradeoff between accuracy and false-positive rate for CCP's bot-checking software and what you'd get would probably be some combination between lots of legitimate players being needlessly banned and lots of bots not being banned.
---
Plus, you know if CCP were to do something like this then they'd half-ass it.
---
Definitely auto correct, but you are correct sir. It fits for sure.
---
Armor Snakes vs armor Leshaks (vs Armor TFIs) is an ongoing debate, if you can kill the site quickly then the snake/tfi will be better for actually running the site, the drifter is much faster with Leshaks though.
---
From some limited testing it seems the best option is 3 Nestor’s for tank, 2 Leshaks/tfis/Snakes for dps, 1 vindi for dps + webs and a praxis fit with a bunch of tank.
---
The drifter *always* seems to go for the praxis, no matter what else you have on grid, we’ve tried undertanked ships, ships with massive sigs (full LSE rattle) and plenty of other things but the praxis is always the target. This allows you to refit everyone else to full dps once the drifter has settled on the praxis.
---
It's called the "cunt cap"...https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3gso6x/this_sign_in_my_neighborhood/cu1c9cc/
---
It can. I've had loads of fun with difficult PvE, especially in groups. The problem is the playerbase is lazy, and if something is harder than mining, they won't do it. Because they can just mine.
---
you are a saint for posting this. One question, why is there 1 integrated ogre and the rest are fed navy? is that intentional?
---
Yea man those were the days, now you can but a fully fit titan with modest green mods for 70b.
---
It should be doable with the right implants and drugs, you can solo run C6 sites in a rattle, though it’s not very practical.
---
Imagining the spaghetti code required for this to happen is kinda terrifying
---
what fort timers havent we shown up to?
---
Wait, wait, wait...you mean to tell me that you don’t have 5 dedicated rorq pilots crushing rocks all day, 5 bomber pilots waiting to drop the next horde nyx that floats off tether (plus a blops bridge), 2 main fleet pvp pilots, a jita alt that doubles as a freighter ganker, a titan pilot, and a neutral jump freighter pilot all logged in at the same time!?
---
Excuse me, what game are you playing?
---
&gt;Wow this is too long for me to care
---
Literally every olmeca post gg
---
Umm... what? You know there are things in space not in orbit of a planet, right? Besides, there is a planet in New Eden. There's also a bunch of Citadels there already too.

This is a legitimate CCPlease post cause the art team always delivers.

i was talking about PL/Snuff/Others counterdropping in enemy space but not deploying their entire super fleet. I don't even know what event you're referencing or if you're just saying, "in general, nobody could really contest NCPL supers".  
---
  
---
i mean now you have a few groups that can challenge one another if the two largest groups in the game don't temp blue for a fight but thats literally 100% going to happen and i also don't understand why any of this is even relevant to the point i was making to begin with
---
Also, even with asset safety you’re seeing alliances unanchor stuff. Without it you’d probably have monthly unancorings to keep the loot down and have everyone stage out of npc stations.
---
auto targeting system
---
also botting software autotargets for you so no need for the mod really lol
---
I volunteer as tribute
---
When did they fuck that up? What idiots. 12 years of wanting to put a POS up there... This is kind of disgusting.
---
Worst and most common opinion of any change ever.
---
Yea credit to them they have been doing good work. I am sure they are aware of what still needs modernizing, but I thought I'd just point out one of the more glaring issues I've noticed.
---
holy lol were you in NC or PL
---
or did you delete your account just from pure r/eve rage?
---
 - "any thing that gets too close is torn to shreds by gravity"
---
- Put an eve gate at the site. 
---
Choose 1.
---
Citadels... they stopped being bound to the same rules as POS. You can anchor them anywhere you want, as long as they aren't too close to anything else.
---
I knew everything about them except that fucky garbage. Unbelievable.
---
I'm sure it would be compatible with every virus protection out there. /s
---
&gt;It wasn't the alliance dickwaving it was individuals in the alliance dickwaving 
---
Goons don't mine, the individuals in the alliance mine.
---
FRT doesn't bot, the individuals in the alliance bot.
---
CODE doesn't gank, the individuals the alliance gank.
---
TAPI doesn't spam local, the individuals in the alliance spam local.
---
What point are you trying to make now?
---
Go read the lore yourself...
---
&gt; The EVE Gate is a giant jump gate located in the New Eden system. The letters "EVE" are prominently written over the top of the gate, although their meaning is unknown.

---
Is there any legitimate need for someone to run in a virtual? Cause frankly it seems like even adding a restriction to using them in the EULA would solve a lot more problems then it would create.
---
maybe with that 64bit client
---
... if that has anything to do with it, I mean. Could be a good opportunity to make graphical updates like this
---
damn, so you're saying they're 1/100th as cowardly as you?
---
that's cold bro.
---
oh shit that lo-fi "Twice"
---
nice vid
---
"You can't dock here fool! Docking request - DENIED!"
---
oh no doubt botting software can click targets, but more interaction with the client *should* make a bot easier to detect. if ccp had any type of statistical analysis going into detecting them that is...
---
And then get banned again until they need to literally get new computer components to not be banned anymore? Idk, if a botter is too lazy to grind out their own isk themselves, I find it unlikely they would be willing to literally buy new computer parts to avoid bans.
---
So the guy that drops a titan on a solo bomber in delve is doing so as an alliance level stratop?
---
No. It's guy who owns a titan that's bored. That's the point he was making.
---
:thonking:
---
literally default to step 5 - much predictable, such bad
---
Probably a typo.
---
Also imo I don’t think geckos are worth cause expensive and they still get aggro.
---
I wasn't? I was proposing a solution to the "*don't fly anything expensive*", but I guess thanks for making yourself look like a jackass?
---
I agree, eve needs higher res sky boxes, compared to everything else they look ugly
---
&gt;So the guy that drops a titan on a solo bomber in delve is doing so as an alliance level stratop?
---
No, but when your major fucking recruiting point is "we drop supers on fucking everything", you can't say disown the fact that your alliance drops supers on fucking everything.
---
The north has always had the dumbest, most out of touch with reality narritive that requires the most insane mental gymnastics to even almost  understand, so this retarded shit isn't surprising.
---
I feel like alliance who actively ignore botting should be punished by ccp
---
I’ve always enjoyed the cataclysmic variable wormhole skybox. I agree the rest could use an update but those ones seem nice
---
yeah but it does work assuming you're wanting to \~max oppression\~ an area b/c those ships aren't worth the fuel to bridge on
---
&gt; if the Virtuals don't give enough values for the Hash
---
a week later the good botting software includes a virtual driver for reporting a bunch of random data to hash. anti-cheat cannot rely on systems the player has control of -- and on PCs that includes the hardware and the OS, down to the deepest level.
---
that doesn't mean that anti-cheat is impossible, just that ideas like this are very naive and worthless.
---
We laughed so hard at Silver's hype ping. Never seen someone so excited about killing a bot before.
---
Man the spin from you dudes is terrible
---
Which one is that?
---
Do you think Vic Lacuna from the Eve Online Retribution Trailer was how CCP actually wanted Black Ops Battleship pilots to be?
---
now you have to detect that your software is running in a VM
---
the VM is hostile and trying to fool you
---
if you can solve this class of problem you can ask one of many big companies for a blank check salary
---
But what if.... they find it fun? :O
---
This was a great read, barrels of laughs.   However I don't know how healthy this is for the game unless they are moving to a more defensible location next to friends like Horde and Frat.  Also with the new cyno jammers I don't think Goons would have the same success or at least would be much harder.
---
&gt;No, but when your major fucking recruiting point is "we drop supers on fucking everything", you can't say disown the fact that your alliance drops supers on fucking everything.
---
And one of the imperiums selling points is we drop our titans on everything.
---
&gt;The north has always had the dumbest, most out of touch with reality narritive that requires the most insane mental gymnastics to even almost understand, so this retarded shit isn't surprising
---
Pushing the propaganda hard aren't we? How quickly we forget the whole "casino war" narrative the imperium pushed when the reality is all the good FC's left and nobody was all that interested in fighting a defensive war, they just wanted to krab. It was the kick in the are they needed after two, three years of stagnation. 
---
PL today's is the same PL it's always been but we are now in an age where titans get tosses around like subcaps. The fear of those spooky PL people is gone because you can simply toss a bigger blob on them. In sov war it's all about numbers now and PL as a small group just doesn't work anymore.

Yep that's bait.
---
Last I heard, some companies were offering 250k for exploits that could traverse virtual machines and communicate directly with the hardware. If anybody makes that a full exploit, every big shopping website on earth will shit their pants. 
---
I agree with klyith, virtual machines do a very very good job of appearing real.
---
Says the player whose alliance is running scared before we've even announced where we are going.
---
Or perhaps your packing up is an unrelated coincidence.
---
You're cherrypicking a moment where you were at your lowest, why can't I?
---
Are some of the tier I ship models older than others? I feel like I’ve seen a difference in quality with not only the meshes but the textures
---
actually, when Tribute was lost, CO2 deployed to Venal to be able to help TEST with the defense of Vale, but TEST chose to evac.
---
The drone compounds are still around but, to the best of my knowledge, they do not drop.    I still have a bunch in my personal corp's deliveries hangars around highsec from some poorly thought out buy orders many moons ago.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Please stop posting.   TIA.
---
CCP sucks at progressing story
---
Botters are usually selling the ISK. Buying new computer parts would just be a business expense.
---
Erm... from what I know of hash functions you can hash two completely different values and get the same result. So if you ban that botter's computer, now you're banning every other poor sod that owns hardware that hashes to the same value as the botter's.
---
Lol. Are you counting one really terrible fort gunner as showing up maybe?
---
What structures? We were evicted weeks ago.
---
I’ve hit my head on my desk a few times and I’m still not dumb enough to understand your question.
---
Could you try rephrasing it maybe?
---
Personally, I'd be reasonably happy if they made the Skins available *at all* across the the ships that share a hull.  It's almost comical how many there are for the Apocalypse vs the Bhaalgorn...
---
Not really, the two things don't have a lot to do with each other.
---
That sounds like a kindness, to be honest. Structure bashing is bad enough. Structure bashing against groups that never undock unless they've got at least 3 active spais in the enemy fleet and can write and defend a doctoral thesis supporting the fact that they will absolutely win the engagement is even worse.
---
It'd be nice if they made the skins so that you could choose (or remove entirely) the empire symbols, if not display corporation and alliance symbols.
---
"Captured" Amarr ships with crudely painted oversized Minmatar logos would be fun too...  (i.e. [This sort of thing](https://i.imgur.com/9mV3dOL.jpg) from WWII.)
---
No fun allowed! It says so in the game EULA.
---
I especially liked where goonswarm federation was at the top of CCP Pelligro's 'Pie Chart of Shame'  dirty botters grr gon hat gon
---
I tried that once. Didn't like it. Being shit is way more fun.
---
I still want a way to tell when corps renting from me have players banned for botting/rmt.  The shittiest part is those few of us who are both in a position to and want to help are not being given anything useful either.
---
Please stop posting
---
I'm a simple man. I see Naz post, I upvote.
---
yes
---
I distinctly remember the big nullsec agreement open letter thing from about five years ago that called for more npc null in isolated regions. This isn't a new idea.
---
To be fair, TIDI was always more tolerable with drugs.
---
O you mean in-game. Nevermind.
---
They also say if you pick your moment and hit the bee with a newspaper it won't sting you.
---
The options are endless!
---

---
I remember, I was in TRI the group that you dudes asked for help and then fought against later on.
---
You seem to be forgetting that highsec and npc null is full of mission running bots, hauling bots, market bots, mining bots and what not. Geography does not affect that.
---
loooooow effort shittttpooooooosting
---
Really? And yet just last year you surrendered to goons and handed over 40 faction fortizars.
---
And since then you've settled comfortably into the role of chihuahua on a lead.
---
So, excuse Eve for not remembering you used to act differently.
---
"I'm in TEST and we don't have a lot of content in our neck of the woods on account that we're blue to everyone, it's true, but if you just ASSUME you'll find no content it GUARANTEES you won't. Hell, I undocked my Revelation today on a whim and just took it cruising, and I managed to find a fight with an Atron that I won pretty handily. True story."

Planet/moon textures also..

I've had this room like 10 times, and this is the first time it happened to me, but I remember seeing another reddit post about it, and having a corp mate happen to him
---
Thanks that will help a ton :)
---
The video says our ALLIES Pandemic Legion. I think it's land lord...
---
I live in a wormhole, you're not forcing me to do anything.
---
That is why I had to leave TEST!!
---
Unless the purpose is to kill you. :)
---
I think someone else had complained about this as well -- you can always open a support ticket &amp; petition it, but that may just tell you "nope, this is intended."
---
Anywho.
---
Alpha's do not get the 1m SP reward. How fucking retarded are you?
---
You're blaming an alliance for the actions of a hand full of people and acting like it was an alliance wide thing, which it wasn't. The guys that liked to do that were a very small minority.
---
Turns out doing that shit required effort, a strong deterrent to most nerds
---
Vily backstabbing GOONS, you heard it here first!
---
Gay sex obviously
---
I don't get it. A little shock would be pleasurable.
---
start with a T1 expo ship - they are crazy cheap. once you make 100m, buy a covops (which will probably cost you about 50m) and you'll be in fine shape.
---
skill up scanning and hacking. 
---
I recommend focusing on a Gallente or Amarr frigates first - if you decide to do an Astero later on, you'll be half way there in terms of skills (since SOE ships require both Gallente and Amarr to fly (well)).
---
Great work Suitonia! Most people think that botting persists just because of greed. You have just proven that it is also a huge problem because of safe space that allows for bots to hide far far away from prying eyes.
---
Drink that koolaid retard
---
Legacy .... Third party ... Idk what you understand of third party but being goons submissive pets as long as you think they win is not third partying, if you actually would third party instead of just helping your master this war would be way more interesting
---
I guess you weren't playing eve at the time, or you would have seen the outrage. Eve would have died within a few months if they went forward with this shit.
---
1.2%'s tremendous revenue is meaningless when most of the other players protest the game over a bullshit model like relying on whale microtransactions.
---
&gt; In an ideal world, sure.
---
Bullshit. In an ideal world, these assets are free to subscribers, not provided at additional charges.
---
I think its fair to say:
---
'Caught up and overtook them'
---
we can aford it  bro
---
I'm sure they are due an update. I have to say that I love the current ones regardless. For a game that is graphically a few objects in the middle of a sky box, it generally looks fantastic.
---
Yeah, my Alliance discussed the Sov System a lot of times and we believe the system as it is right now makes no sense.
---
More Ratting should mean less valuable Rats and Sites, not more. 
---
Claimed Null-Sec should be more like Low-Sec ratting wise.
---
Null-Sec should either be "Wild Space Frontiers" with lots of valuable Pirats or "Colonialized" with less Pirats but growing Infrastructurs
---
VEDA!
---
Yeah this is fake news. 
---
A real Test pilot would have batphoned goons first.
---
I had a similar situation to you. My Corp was made of 5 RL friends, we ended up in two small scale alliances. Small scale alliances (15-35 actual capusleers) would have no issue taking in you guys. I recommend joining one of these for a month to build up and get a taste of alliance life. From there you can decide if you want to stay or move to a larger one. You can find adds for them on eve forums or even browsing zkill can help. Do research on their activity and timezone to see if you will fit in.
---
Hope this textwall helps!
---
It happen from time to time. It started 1 or 2 patches ago.
---
How did you think it was pronounced?
---
It was changed recently but yes as the mothership reached the next level of construction the leshak fleet moved to the spawn point.
---
&gt;Because they can just mine.
---
it's because pve isn't engaging, only the interaction with other people that makes it good
---
mining is easy and afk and allows you to make isk while not playing the game
---
When I used to work for a cloud hosting company, we were not allowed anything installed on our PCs, but there was nothing wrong with installing VMs or using a 'Cloud' server to play games.
---
Honestly I like it the way it is, for both story and game play reasons. If there was a physical object that radiated damage someone would figure out how to tank it, get up to the object itself, then complain that nothing happens when you get to it. It doesn't add anything game play wise more than a decoration, which is what it already is. In terms of story and theme, I like that the origin of humanity in New Eden is a far off, untouchable thing, and the only thing we can get from it is it's radiant light. The Eve gate is there, but it's not really important to the ongoing story, its just background on the universe and what happened after is the interesting part. I'd also be against them adding NPCs to the system, the loneliness and emptiness with nothing but the markers left by previous capsuleer travelers is part of what makes the pilgrimage cool in my opinion.

I realize salvaging in high sec isn’t a gold mine but I’m screwing around. I put an expanded probe launcher on my thrasher and I have to shut off everything to use it, then I can’t turn on my afterburner without being docked. Any ideas on a work around?

I tried overclocking and I have two cap rechargers.

[hi](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/303ouw/rip_skynet/cpoycko/)
---
To be fair a Sotiyo in Y-M isn't really a threat to either Provi or Legacy. HTP and their friends are - for all practical/strategical/planing purposes - PanFam alt groups, and as such don't really need super manufacturing facilities down south. If they want or need supers they can just get them up north and bring them down, as they have done thus far.
---
The one asset they have that might be considered a threat to Legacy is their Camal Keepstar, as it offers super jump range on Legacy fringe systems in Catch. However Legacy (or rather: TEST) have shown they don't really care about this, given that they literally saved that Keepstar recently, as OP mentioned.
---
All in all, having Sotyios in the Providence region changes very little for the overall situation there. Both Provi-Bloc and HTP always had options for getting supers when needed, so it's little more than a convenience thing, being able to actually build them there.
---
Hulls get gradually updated. The newest models are osprey basi etc. But yeah currently we have models that are couple years old together with Brand new ones.
---
My Rorqual was fit with the following:

I agree with you. I stopped running t5 because of this.

Having more Skillpoints than other pilots = literally superior player skills.

Subnautica is so freaking good. Im amazed i could be immersed in something so deeply, and actually feel things like those eureka moments, or actual fear (99% of horror-based games i can get through no problem, with no fear felt) and just the sense of awe, great soundtrack too!
---
Excited for the expansion/add-on/self-described standalone story?
---
You’ll have better luck in null. Wormholes are the bombdotcom, but mechanics do not favor alliances, there. Bookmark mechanics being chief amongst those concerns. If you want to play in wormhole space, you should be prepared to join an existing Corp, or strike out on your own. Either way, I’m always going to say “give it a try”. I didn’t start having fun in this game, until I left nullsec, after being there for almost two years. Wormhole space is an amazing place for small groups.
---
I'm not disputing the lore.
---
I'm telling you why it is no longer there.
---
Ok so you have a killable structure you know belongs to your enemy and because one person in a leadership position makes some deal to leave it it's not a threats? Are they building super if yes kill it more so since you wasted time on timers before. It's a good chance to take out a hostile resource yea ignoring it makes sense.
---
Hashing is the wrong way to do this. The entire point of a hash is that a very small difference in content results in a very different hash. You can’t get any usable information from “similar” hashes. 
---
Fingerprinting does what you are thinking of, but as mentioned above, VMs kill that approach immediately. Not to mention that aggressively collecting enough user data to get a guaranteed fingerprint has some serious privacy and legal implications. 
---
I mean, if you’re going to inspect the user’s system, browser history, other application state, you might as well start examining other running processes and just figure out if they are running an external app that’s feeding commands to the clients and be done with it. But it’s a quagmire that CCP doesn’t want to get into, for pretty good reasons, imo.
---
Took the words right out of my keyboard! Thanks!
---
1 jammer though? Would that be better?
---
Torpedos are short range, that's the only thing. I think l4s were less hard at the time. I went to YouTube and found a really old video showing a fit for l4 missions. It was a cruiser I believe.
---
agreed. Honestly, given such a ... *strange* change 'broke' it, I was expecting CCP to leave it broken and was making plans to haul without it.
---
I'm very glad I didn't have to.
---
i wouldnt call the sotiyo killable. Provi-bloc cant kill it alone, as they dont have the numbers in Us tz to beat RC and friends. The only chance that it will die is when some bigger ns alliance helps provi. its the same thing with the 9UY fortizar
---
I believe the Kirin is fairly new but the texture on that model is horrendous
---
Woop woop.
---
I mean they got some decent content in trade. Only lost 13 bil of caps to a subcap fleet at home and fed 30+ bil of caps in a failed dread bomb in their opponent's home.

[laughs in Empyrean Age empire wars]
---
Can confirm...   
---
The Alliance that owns it, and paid for it, is actually former provi dudes that left the CVA side of things cause CVA treats their friends like shit.
---
I mean, are you seriously arguing that no one has ever had fun playing PVE, in any game, ever? Cause that's a pretty hard line to take.
---
And PVE can involve interaction. And interaction that's more fun than "cloak up at a safe when someone enters local," but the player base doesn't want anything that can't be farmed by one person.
---
tbh it seems like he wants this more for roaming pvp and is just using the botting outrage to sell it
---
i would be more on board without the deception
---
I'm assuming that when you buy those, it's bulk quantities meant to be traded rather than consumed, such as when you buy them in a store. As for Exotic Male Dancers, you can't really put a price on such ecstasy, can you?

IIRC, the EVE gate is way out in deep space. Might be too far for warp drives to lock onto.
---
Legend has it that many many years ago, an adventurous pilot spent 6mo flying at fastest possible sublight in a rifter and made it into the EVE Gate.
---
   
---
They fell out of New Eden and into a Wow server. Flying over a raid party in a huddle he shouted down "LEEROOOOY JEEENKIIINSS!!!"
---
    
---
This apparently startled them all into running foolishly into danger without being organized.  As the Rifter pilot flew out of control and crashed some say they heard him say something about "At least I had chicken"....
---
The EVE gate was rediscovered 20 thousand years after civilization collapsed in New Eden. The gate is very much still there.
---
Honestly it's a revenge note. They are making them evac just as what happened to goons years ago. The thing is people are going to want content. What will be the next major war where both sides fight?
---
Some people just want to ~~watch the world burn~~ build a rental botting emprie
---
I didn't have access to a computer or internet, you fucking mongoloid. Jesus christ you're a fucking moron.
---
This is actually a good post. 
---
CCP take note the key to a healthy EVE is better connections for regions so far removed from the rest of the map.
---
 Give us the ability to roam more so we ca see more bots so we can report them.

I don´t think anyone of his line membes understands or enjoys the metagame he is playing, me neither - Camal endet up in a  disappointment  for like 300 TESTicles, who endet up flying hours in confusion on 10% tidi for nothing - and losing 400b to a revenge fleet in their homestaging - even more depressing.

Chuckled and the flash of "BOTTERS WELCOME"
---
I always been against goons but this problem was generated by Nc/Pl themselves with their Elite attitude and rude maners in their gameplay towards players.
---
Having stupid requirements to join any corp and/or not allowing rookies to join their ranks doomed them from start.
---
Who would guess a rookie in a frigate would be flying a titan a few years later, specially with the rorq changes that was introduce a few years ago and on top of that skill injecting. These two changes made it possible for goons to now only catch up with the HIGHSKILLED Nc/Pl pilots but also get the big toys needed :)
---
Also being terrible in making friends and backstabbing helped to push people towards the goon side and tip the scale into their favour.
---
You dont need to be Einstein to figure that shit out :)
---
Instead goons accepted anyone and gain enough members to first win the numbers war and now they have won the titan/super cap race:)
---
If Nc/Pl would have been more careful about this three points the scale would be more equal and maybe they could have been able to defend their own space, after all they are so ELITE:)
---
You made your bed now its time to sleep on it :(

Sigh... seems like no content for small gangs of ~5 people again.

I want to do something with my friends, not some random dudes in a maximum efficiency bling public fleet.
---
those are actually quite a bit older than the ones we have in k space too
---
There is also a huge cultural and ethical difference. In the Eurasian area it is more accepted/expected that you will do everything to win in a competive enviroment, cheating to do so is not wildly frowned upon. So botting to gain acces to more resources (seperate from the RMT question) is barely a thing.
---
Very nice info, I totally agree that there is a need for more non player owned territories around null. The issue with dronelands is - it has always been a tradeoff between not so good space to do stuff in vs being more isolated and harder to reach thus you usually were left alone more than other places. If you make it more accessible for hunters etc, than you would need to do something about dronelands bounties, loot, sites etc.
---
The stage 3 Xordazh construction room does put you at zero, yeah - not sure if it's a bug or unintended, but tbh I've found it easier to complete the room as a result. Approaching the Leshaks from 90+km away means they have a ton of time to rep each other - landing right on 0 lets you take them out a hell of a lot quicker, despite how scary it is (and the fact that you can't get away, the gate is 90km from the landing point)
---
remember the days when panfam would drop 100 titans to alliances that couldnt field &gt;2 ...

That is bitching about skynet which was overpowered. But I have also bitched extensively about the current overpowered monsters.

Just imagine a totally not input broadcasting rorqual fleet go into panic multiple times a day
---
Yea, there's truth in that.
---
Main problem from the Provi perspective, when it comes to structure timers, isn't RC itself but rather it's backup. RC can't really out-form Provi anymore in the US TZ, and every day skirmishes can easily go either way.
---
However for timers we are usually talking PanFam proper, not just RC. Most timers end up being handled by NC. and/or Horde, in addition to RC.
---
You rly need to get help.

It's like mining salt, mining structures. you know how much it annoys people having to go to low sec to retrieve their stuff and paying 15% tax on it. :P

No, that would be NC.

i'm not really seeing a problem, CCP are trying to boost their login numbers, if you can't log in 16 / 20 days then you are still getting some of the rewards.. i.e. the ones you deserve because those of us who do log in each day for it get more because we are helping CCP make their numbers look better.

It sounds like you tried to join them, failed and are now salty about it.

I don't think the sky box is that bad. The whole idea is that you can't get anywhere near the wormhole, so having it be warpable or approachable isn't really thematic.

Not saying there can't be a bigger sense of occasion in New Eden, but being able t fly up to it feels wrong

It's pretty much impossible to win an all out engagement against a bigger force in EVE. Back in WWB with the focus on entosis you at least had the element of tenacity. Now with pretty much everything revolving around destructible structures it's just who can bring the bigger force on the grid. That is Goons and Test right now, so not really any point fighting it out. Numbers aren't even close enough to be worth speculating on timezones or anything. 
---
The best way to fight wars right now for anyone not tapirium is probably indeed retreating to lowsec and wait until they get bored and continue crabbing afterwards, as wars right now are decided by economic strength over everything else and since crabs tend to go where it's safest, that won't change any time soon.

Yeah there was a coop platform adventure type tech demo they showed at eve Russia a few years ago iirc. You'd take a few guys and explore sleeper structures, complete puzzles, etc to get to loot at the end. Sounded neat but I doubt it ever got beyond the demo stage.

I member when we first got those beautiful sky boxes. Was a huge upgrade from what we had before.

And I remember when all this was fields.

Pretty sure goons have the biggest and test the second biggest force in any time zone right now.

People didn't want 3 years of 0 development on spaceships to get walking in stations. If they hadn't completely neglected the spaceship part of eve people would have probably been fine with it. It would have certain my opened eve to a larger playerbase that would have helped it a lot these days :p
---
I admit, I mostly enjoy being in test and after reading this post I am debating an application to eve uni.
---
Depends. Crystal meth does not help at all. :(
---
Its genuinly infuriating to catch a vni only for the fucker to just warp out, any ship fast enough to catch one isn't going to sacrifice far more running 2 scrams than a vni does running 1 stab
---
I suppose he meant that the non-titan pilots don't matter very much. If panfam had 2k titans amongst their 25k and goons 1k amongst their 50k the total line members would be pretty much irrelevant. 
---
If the average linemember is as likely to own a titan in goons as in ncpl, than yes, numbers matter.
---
Security rating is just that - a rating on the security level offered by CONCORD. It says nothing about how big a solar system is or where it is located.

When anchored cans persisted forever, it was kinda fun going there and flying towards the skybox wormhole from the gate.  You'd get all the cans people left behind when they gave up and turned back, like a really badly written bermashave advertisement.
---
Meh. I don't care about the story of Eve. Stuff happened in the past. Explosion. Civilization had to start over, here we are, cool.
---
The "story" of Eve has always been about the people who play it, with the more unique characters taking up the leading roles. Doesn't need non-player created events.
---
and so you started crying about blobs, super proliferation and skill injectors
---
You can still power on modules while in space, however you need to have either 75% or 90% of your capacitor, I don’t know which one is it. Your capacitor rechargers will help that, as your cap will go back to onlining level sooner :)
---
Thrasher itself is a good salvaging ship, as is every turret destroyer, and you have the extra speed, which is nice.
---
Just a quick question : you use the expanded probe launchers to launch combat probes and scan down ships running missions, so you can steal their wrecks, right ?

I do run my gaming Windows in a virtual machine. That way I can run TS, slack and so on on my Linux host. In addition, I can talk in TS while windows is rebooting. I get trusted disk encryption and snapshots from linux too. Though, the disk read/write speed is bit slow in my setup.
---
That said, Google Stadia would look similar to the EVE client as my setup. So, there is that.
---
Maybe you could require known graphics card, but I guess that could be fooled too.
---
Providence needs to understand they got the initial help not because of Providence but because there were plenty of PL forts to be captured. TEST was nowhere when Provi got rolled, they came in when the timing to capture the forts were optimum.

You are at best, convenient friends or content. So yea.

Please, could you guys.....
---

I love the salt. :D

Is the no limit to PL’s web of alts, if they just put all of them into PL instead of HK B0T PHEW SKILLU NC they would out number goons easily.
---
These are quality. I used to hate your posts. Keep hatred and brutal killing out of it and it's actually a joy to read
---
The closest system of New Eden is low sec, but the gate itself might not be close to the edge of the system. It could be 10k AU off, far too distant to warp to, yet that's barely 0.15 light years. Space is fricken huge and even warping is slow.
---
Yeah, it would be impossibele to alter bots to do that. 
---
And i am completely sure, no salvage bots exist so far. 
---
Phew, lucky we have you, problem solved.
---
Do you even play the game anymore?
---
Yeah, but that is a local system money fro bribes and such. The actual ISK value of that is negligeable.
---
My first time I had this room I spawned also in the middle of them all about a 120 km away from the gate. There were about 10 renewing with a bunch of other once next to them. There was nothing I could do with my shiney Gila and I died.
---
bringing back the old wh skyboxes would be even more amazing, i miss yellow C4 space
---
That playstyle is dead. Since the moon change at the latest.
---
It's fine for an alliance the size of snuff (with access to goon space to make isk and build/buy supers) any larger than that it's not feasible. CCP made sure of that with the Rorq/structure/moon changes.  
---
And I mean, what are they going to do for content? Goons/Test are way to big, no one else is going to give them any fight plus they can't really afford to lose any of their supers because they wouldn't have the means to replace them.
---
TBH, rekking crew seem much more friendly then the PvP groups in the imperium best I can tell. After all, rekking crew aren't staging a dread bomb in stain to my knowledge and we aren't killing DHSJ rorqs every night while bastion is feeding to gokus like a renter organization with less balls.
---
A lot of people are probably discouraged from incursions because of the rather steep logistical cost that comes with the entire traveling circus around them. 
---
I bet the abyssal incursions are going to be EVEs version of the dungeon finder. It probably won't go as far as randomly thrown together fleets but be accessible everywhere at anytime thanks to filaments. Could be fun. Or horrible.
---
A similar mechanic could work for events.

Just make it an absolute. Get too close, ship dead and podded. Done. No way to tank if the programming says 'everything past this point blows up'.

Don't make it do dps then. Make it a hard line with progressively increasing damage to a point, then immediate destruction.

Caps in low-class space are massive targets for wh corps. You're either getting evicted or you're going to get seeded and periodically harassed when you're farming. You're better off just having an astra + a raituru and/or a athanor if you want to do indy stuff. Most people aren't going to bother a single full powered singular citadel. The time:reward ratio just isn't there. Realistically you don't even want a C4 for the same reason. time:reward isn't there. C5 on the other hand you can be making 1bil+ an hour depending on what you're farming sites and drifters with. At that point then it's probably worth building a Cap or two for the sole purpose of farming the drifters instead of home defense. You are not going to defend your solo farmhole from a wh entity without you having affiliation with another wh entity. It's just not going to happen.
---
It’s not like Provi doesn’t batphone whoever they can to help, though. If the timer is important enough for the north to come it’s probably also important enough for at least some of Imperium or Legacy to show up

The Spod Emperor of Goon Kind, May He Live Forever, has not even hinted at what region of New Eden his loyal buzzing bees will prosecute His Will. Yet the unanchoring of staging structures is happening as I write this. Unless you aim to plant those structures in Delve. Pamfam(for lack of a better and less obsolete name) is, indeed running from His Wrath.

I can tell you RMT is not the only reason people do this.   Eve is made up from different communities,  different groups of players with different playstyles.   
---
And yes,  botting is a playstyle,  in its core its even elegant. 
---
Im not talking about the people that just load a script and press play.   I would be really impressed if people had incursion bots,  abyssal bots,   everything that ccp throws at them,  and then countered by smart scripting,  thats the challenge some do enjoy.   Its like watching your railway train setup.
---
Suitona's idea does not fix the underlining reason why people bot..  I think the only concern is when botting isk is used for powerplays,  events that shape eve online.

As long as we have retarded people on the planet,  they will always wave their wallet,  loose their shiny ships,  sometimes on stream and we laugh at it..

except just because it's widely used doesn't mean it isn't a festering shithole of a language it just means domain knowledge passed on from going to school to design A\^n games puts these nerds in a massive spinmaster which they are unable to escape where developers and especially businesses are brainwashed and stockholm syndrome'd into believing it's the only viable option
---
you could have this same conversation in 1986 with someone who is convinced that all games should be written in assembly
---
yee^k^now
---
So your solution is to add more systems when much of null already is dead and empty. And this is to a large portion due to the fact that you can perma farm anomalies in upgraded systems rather than have to spread out.
---
I'm gonna go with no on that suggestion.
---
Warping isn't slow? What are you on about? 
---
5 AU/s (typical frigate speed) is around 2500x the speed of light if my maths is correct
---
Yes it might take around 30 minutes to reach your 10,000 AU warp, but warping is way faster than anything else
---
Also worth considering the system names on the way out. Someone's journey is recorded in them. There used to be a violent wormhole in one of the near by systems, and a monolith in Dead End. It's all about the story after arrival, the source is just a faded relic.
---
That is such a senseless thing to do, much off null sec is completely dead already. 
---
Being a contrarian I will suggest removing all systems that doesn't have enough activity over the course of a month, and repeat the process a few time per year.
---
Nice work. Take my upvote

If a game I like to play changes into a direction I don't like, I can either adapt or say fuck it and continue the way I like until it's no longer possible.

If the only way to win wars in EVE anymore is by becoming a PVE-alliance, I guess I'd rather lose PVPing, but ty.

I'm not saying this will fix everything 100%, over my 13 years playing I've learnt that one change can't fix a problem entirely.  I've got a massive list of suggestions but bring in a renter alliance means I normally get shot down so never really had the will to write it all down in a post.
---
In terms of the new space you'd need to do a massive rework of how things work - ditch static asteroid belts, move to something like filament style deadspace anoms, make sec status dynamic based on player activity etc.  I'd even go as far as saying having destructible and player built (but open access) stargates.
---
&gt; Because I told you the way to win now is the same as it allways was so you don't have to act like you need to be krab fortess to do it.
---
Whatever you think of any of the changes to industry/sov/etc over the year, that is clearly wrong. Back then you could earn lots of ISK by controlling moons in lowsec etc. So, just being able to defend stuff was providing income. No need to actually live there. 
---
Rorqs, moon changes and better utilization of sov through structures etc have massively changed that. Again, whether you like those changes or not, it's just wrong that nothing has changed.
---
Old wh models CCpls
---
This case is slightly different: you will not have 2 separate plots in 1 graph (if I'm using these terms correctly, that is). Actual range, actual velocity and actual angular velocity are both functions of the same parameters, so you end up with 1 plot, where X is chosen orbit and Y can be any combination of:
---
- actual range
---
- actual velocity
---
- actual angular speed
---
So theoretically you could put two or three of them on one graph, as one plot will represent them. However, if you "prime" plot against one of them (so that this parameter is on primary Y axis, which has linearly increasing values), the other two will be non-linear and thus if you represent them as secondary Y axis, they will be harder to read. Also with this representation you cannot compare two different fits (because each fit will have its own scale for secondary Y-axes). 
---
I guess ideal way would be to let the user choose what to use as value for Y axis and show the other two when user hovers his mouse over a data point. Will see if it's possible to implement.
---
The thought of these together even unmixed makes me want to puke
---
I think it's more accurate to say "nobody wanted the CQ we got" rather than "nobody wanted CQ". Lots of people wanted CQ. People were very excited about CQ. One of the reasons the anger was so intense was because of just how disappointing the CQ that was delivered was in comparison to the CQ that was promised. There was a real feeling of "... That's it? Wtf?"
---
Remember old low-class skyboxes? :'/
---
Like actually? Delete all supercaps from the game i think, they literally delete the fun in the game for SO many people. Anyway, thats wishthinking and I know it's never gonna happen, more realistically put more effort into finding and banning botters in the first place because these guys are literally the reason why we have that a shitty inflation rate right now
---
It's pretty warm here again just now.  We just aren't made for sunshine.
---
I don't want coalitions to be forced to break up but there should be penalties that make it harder to exist the larger you get.
---
In terms of single alliances you could introduce dynamic sec status, so the more you rat/mine in system the lower the status, exponential sov cost, etc.
---
For coalitons it's certainly harder to control, maybe introduce a billable treaty system to replace standings which becomes exponentiallyore expensive.
---
But your right straying away from the BOT theme but only because it's part of a wider problem of things that need fixing and everyine seems to think one quick fix is all you need.
---
lmao you seen our numbers lately?
---
Failed to see what that has to do with vily denying their own Alliance content especially after a FC went out of their way to create a timer.
---
Not in our christian sub
---
This is what your dumb ass leadership get for announcing the war... You lost the element of surprise.. 
---
Since eve has no defensive structures, why not put yourself in a war footing and limit your exposure... by removing assets, It makes perfect tactical sense.
---
Don't get us wrong: we aren't complaining that they come.
---
These timers are usually not important in any real sense. Mostly it's just things plopped down for content creation. Having a bunch of 3rd parties come down for a nice brawl is what most people in Provi are hoping for.
---
Groups like Horde come down not because the timer is important, but because Provi is undoubtedly forming for it, and we prefer undocking and fighting even when the odds are shit. It's the high likelihood of content that drives the whole situation.
---
The "A lot of money" item is only a lot of money on a particular planet and is worth extremely little in ISK.
---
The joke of that mission is that the person is asking for a lot of planetside currency (which is entirely worthless in space) instead of ISK which is worth far more. Canonically speaking, 1 ISK is enough to feed a family for 10 years if they were planetside.
---
I don't think this would be the good change to make to keep or bring back players. There are better options, fixing lowsec and bringing a little life back into highsec would be a good start.
---
Too many smily faces
---
It's been heading this way since Goons started mining. Unless something changes drastically, or Goons decide to NOT go for full overkill to allow content in the game, this will end up like the chinese server has.
---
Its not the Leshak fleet that moved to spawnpoint, its our spawnpoint that moved inside the leshak fleet (from 30km from gate to 120 off gate) Ive had it once, was lucky there where no starving / tangling leshaks and managed to survive.

We came across some issues with cyno jammers last war, we eventually just broke the IHUB of the system we wanted to attack. It seems to me that we would do the same thing if the cyno jammers become an issue again.

I haven't been very active in-game lately (RL is being a bitch) but I keep up with what's happening. Don't have to actually be in a fleet to know that there *is* a fleet, and how it turns out.

say what you like about goons, but they have enough ISK floating around to run fun events and competitions like this
---
i do remember a thread once about a NC or PL duded who lost his rorquals while mining... they mocked him so bad the guy rage quit or something.
---
 This is what happens when you don't open your alliance to infrastructure building and industry. The other side just build supers and titans. 
---
Although very unskilled the sheer numbers of weaponized krabs will beat a more elite pvp alliance that mocks empire infrastructure building and holds on to 2010 renting meta to generate income.

They become stale and the war in 2018 should have been a huge wake up call to them. Time to build up they had.

Delve is pretty well covered, it is to make areas like Omist or ~~Drone~~Bot Lands to be as reachable from NPC stations as Delve is.
---
Hi, I started doing some small gang pvp in null and was looking for a good ship to catch people with that doesn't need too much SP. I'll have 1m sp to spend on friday for this.
---
just a wild guess but 26% are botters?
---
seconding the above info as 100% legit
---
eve-O Preview is basically essential
---
This pales vs goons shitposting my gosh.
---
On the topic at hand, I can recount many null roams where we didn't assume we'd find no content, but damn we found no content.
---
Here's an idea too - make MTUs take 10-15 seconds to scoop. This makes everyone have a choice - save the loot or save the ship. It's not a huge amount of time, but it's long enough to get an inty on top of the ratter and point it
---
you need to be richer and willing to risk more than the other traders in that market to successfully do that, tho
---
Because keeping nullsec safer is a valuable playstyle and using broken NPC mechanics to do it should be encouraged.
---
No. We'll ask for citadels. You already have tons of mechanics in favor of keeping plebs safe.
---
They must have been some hoopy froods. Much better than a book of Vogon poetry....
---
So you took out gating a capital ship and only found a frigate and that's supposed to be anecdotal evidence for nullsec isn't dead?
---
PLEX market is a lot more competitive these days.
---
you can still make isk for trading though. look for items with a consistent price and high margins, and trade those. Or buy low in Jita and sell higher elsewhere, where the items are actually bought/wanted. A PVP player is willing to pay 2 million for a Damage Control II he needs *right now*, and does not want to go 17 jumps to Jita to get it.
---
I like how you try to spin botting like it would result from lack of NPC stations within reach. Its not. Bots online is present in any part of eve universe.
---
Don't be, i was told not to, i did it to myself.
---
your average player floats at around ~3b ISK and more in assets. spacerich is probably "I can afford to lose a few titans"-tier of rich.
---
Guess americans should be careful about making jokes of nerds in trenchcoats ....
---
galaxy brain: vertically integrated PI farms with T2 manufacturing, making mad isk
---
Yeah, maybe also a unique look for lowsec gate to stain... Oh wait.
---
ccpls gate to stain oh wait
---
Moons are worth more than they used to be - just isn't passive income anymore.  Even low moons, often are worth it for the ore fields they can spawn.  I believe it would be quite possible for a corp or alliance to live in NPC null/low and have indy based around moon mining.
---
Hook, line, and sinker
---
It does but most turbonerds miss where the story is. Lore in Eve is just background noise. Our ingame action is the story. The expansions have only been about implementing new features and not progression of some end game story. The headlines from Eve literally consist of crazy shit we the players did, not some lore shit.
---
&gt;HTP and their friends are - for all practical/strategical/planing purposes - PanFam alt groups
---
Okay dude im gonna say this as not a troll and not anyone involved with either PanFam or HTP anymore, but if you believe this then you are seriously deluding yourself. 
---
The only crossover between HTP and PanFam is that some dudes are friends from times before and are in the group RekkingCrew, which consists of members of Pandemic Legion, Waffles, Domain Research, Purple Helmeted, and Honorable Third.
---
&gt;My emergent play style is a valuable part of the game but your emergent counter is broken NPC mechanics.
---
I'm proud to have been one of the people on the line at UALX who broke that myth.
---
And, unlike Brave, PL couldn't come back from that defeat.
---
&gt; To All Those People That Say "NullSec is Dead"
---
Who the fuck says that?
---
Let me sum up Grath for you.
---
It was fun having supercap superiority.
---
When we stopped having supercap superiority, the game stopped being fun and I quit.
---
On confirmation of bot account: set all skill points to 0.
---
“You idiot! They just have to get a skill injector and they’re back up and running in no time!”
---
For sure. How many times are they going to do that before the costs outweigh the benefits?
---
Rocket is a good guy. There isn't really a directly comparable group to his in the Imperium.
---
Hmm, yes, using a period of four goddamn months is clearly cherry picking.
---
Don't be dumb.
---
The radiation being emitted from the gate is strong enough that it’ll destroy most ships that try to get close. So even if you managed to warp there you’ll probably be destroyed in short order.
---
DHSJ Rorq???
---
You should read a few of the top comments in that thread though.
---
I think Counter repping was a better mechanic than the damage cap here, since offenders have a hard time getting caps and super into tje system in the first place.
---
And the overwhelming fax reps vs. subcap dps are largely mitigated by the new diminishing returns. 
---
At the very least you can get some fax kills out of it that way.
---
Hold Ctrl, you will be able to drag a rectangle around a bunch of rats. Watch the magic happen.
---
This quality of shitposting can only be rewarded with Platinum. Enjoy it!
---
There used to be an object that did more damage the closer you got actually https://evetravel.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/terminus-stream/
---
you remember when goons ran in wwb? They had far better odds than this
---
yea nc. were not deployed then
---
why not to make system self-sustaining against bots ?
---
I like the proposal that increasing amount of rat/kills should triggered npc invasion to that system.
---
and this invasion should be finished only when "mother is killed", but if not - it will slowly spread to nearest systems.
---
If region is occupied by real players - they will unite to kill it and free the region. if botters - no way. but even if they will - it will take time and effort to do this, while botting will be stopped.
---
even at alliance controlled nullsec currently - invasion means stopped usual ratting and mining activity.
---
so invasion should become not a random but regular triggered event based on rat/kills activity.
---
triggers can be setted up differently but i guess it is easy to implement mechanic without deleting system or disrupting entire regions with npc/pvp stations
---
Mentioned it in another comment but there used to be an object called the terminus stream https://evetravel.wordpress.com/2012/04/15/terminus-stream/ which would start doing increasing damage until the point at which it would be instantly exploding ships as you got too close. There’s some videos on YouTube of people getting close and dying I think. But it got removed for unknown reasons.
---
no you didn't. You faced a sig for a year. playing that like you faced goons is one of the most retarded spins i've ever seen. I was in KOS back then, and all of leadership + fcs literally folded under pressure from a sig smaller than any alliance in GOTG. 
---
when goons actually deployed you did nothing while co2 carried your dead corpse, when co2 collapsed you surrendered.
---
"no buy more skins"
---
You can still get small quantities as loot from rubbish cans inside some rogue drone DED sites.
---
&gt;Observation 
---
They keep it in a Small Secure Container next to the sound.
---
im not one for really bothering to recall them... tech 2 dones are so cheap that loosing the odd one or 2 here and there really doesnt matter.  as long as you go in with a full flight of drone then really you will have zero issues
---
After "log off safely" your ship is gone from space.
---
"Log off" leaves your ship in space for those 30s(or longer with timers) someone could scan and attack you in that time.
---
No, you would just screw the smaller alliances first with that one.
---
The joke:
---
    H i t l e r

---
    H i * * * r
---
You could use double nano Imperial navy slicer, the dramiel is the fastest frigate in eve but costs fairly much. If you wanna go with a cheap one you can use the slasher which I think is the fastest of the t1 frigates
---
My point was that from Provi's perspective, when planing defenses or attacks on RC assets, you must assume that you are actually fighting PanFam.
---
I don't know if they are actual alts of PanFam members, or if they just have close ties with them. However from our point of view it doesn't really matter. We know that when any non-trivial RC asset is in danger, or when RC comes close to killing any Provi assets, we will actually be fighting PanFam fleets. That's what matters in the end.
---
How about we come up with a proper solution, rather than shove in yet another ill thought out simple fix that ends up in another mess like the rorqual?
---
If you're looking for something cheap, Nestors. 5-600m/ship. 15-20 minutes sites. I was recently told that you shouldn't farm in a C4 due to their being lots of them &amp; hunting WH corps will generally have a C4 static, the chances of you getting caught is much higher. I'm fairly new to wormholes so not sure how true it is
---
Your idea has the level of
---
"Lets just make it impossible for homeless ppl to seek shelter anywhere in order to fix the problem of having homeless ppl" 
---
stupidety.
---
Ofc. botters, carebears and krabbers will go for the safest space possible. I mean shocker, who knew? By removing the security of that space you dont solve anything, you just make them move to the next safest and so on and so on.
---
The geography of botting is utter nonsense imho. 
---
Not accounting for jump ranges is just stupid aswell.
---
&gt;  or if you have a low IQ.
---
I do not know about that, i watched Rick and Morty and found it funny. 
---
Now fite meeeeee you snowflake!
---
What I meant by slow is, there's a reason jump gates/bridges/drives were created. Warping is still impractical when it comes to distances greater than a few hundred AU within solar systems due to time required and the constant capping out you'd need to manage. I'm not sure on the lore behind warp drive limitations but the most obvious explanation for why you can't visit the EVE gate (other than "CCP and extra effort not go hand in hand") would be simple distance.
---
That's a proper nerd wall right there. Nice.
---
I can see that for wide empires, speaking in classic strategy game terms, the problem however is how strong tall empires are.
---
Too much of both is a problem tbh.  How to manage a balance without restricting the sandbox too much is the true challange...
---
So can we all stop pretending that NC/PL are still a superpower? Yeah I get it, they ran the game for 10 years, but now they’re literally unanchoring keepstars before they even know where Imperials are deploying to. I can’t imagine the bad posting if goons did this.
---
Yes. You see not all emergent playstyles are valuable. Those that generate content and fun by making space less safe are. Those that deny by making space safer aren't. "Emergent" itself do not indicate inherent value. Wardeccers in the old system were emergent. 8500 km/s HICs were emergent.
---
Also, it's not emergent when NPCs get stuck in station model, unattackable, 0 velocity, non-interactable, and always calling friends. That's just a bug exploit.
---
That cardgame was pretty fun, even if it eventually ended up with my friends always getting steamrolled by my deck of massing cheap gallente ships.
---
Why’d you leave it in the plastic anyway OP? Collector’s value or something?
---
Removing renter space is hard as its not an ingame mechanic. 
---
Ofc people like test, goons, panfam and skillu could give it up "for the good of the game" but why should they rob themselfs of an advantage? 
---
Also for the groups like skillu its there main source of income, they not really do empire building to the levels of test or goons. 
---
This reads more like a rant and not really a feasible solution.
---
You forgot a few things. CSM majority bloc players will not push this agenda.
---
CCP and asset safety have created a culture of lazy entitled idiots and crushed the joy of eve. Namely the possibility that you can lose and lose big. Fear is gone from eve. That was the only thing that made eve great.
---
Oh salt, delicious fuel
---
Fair point yeah, sorry if I came across as overly aggressive!
---
Asset safety actually isn't an issue. People will fight whether or not it exists if other issues are resolved. Losing your stuff for weeks and having to pay a chunk of isk to get it back from some deadend lowsec system is still a powerful motivator, especially for - to no one's surprise - smaller entities.
---
Even if the CSM did push for solutions, CCP may very well not listen anyway. We can't rely on that as an answer to the current day problems.
---
remove rental empires as in, like, expecting landlord groups to give up the free isk? extremely unlikely imo, this is a turbocapitalist game aftert all and if there's a chance for someone to profit on something, expect that chance to be taken. 
---
while I agree that renting drains content and is ultimately not good for the game, the changes need to come from CCP side imo.
---
Thats why you should Vote Cable Uta for CSM with all your accounts! ;)
---
I agree that it might not be the be-all-end-all ultimate solution - but it does sound like a fairly easy to implement/harmless to the game fix.
---
It will certainly have some impact on botting, that is a given.
---
I realise some of the residents and I don't mean botters, just regular honest renters, will be opposed to this idea as additional accessibility from pvp roaming gangs is set to make their life slightly harder.
---
Do please suggest some possible downsides to this "easy to implement" idea.
---
Not everything is still in the plastics.
---
I played the game a few times (with prebuild decks) with a friend. We always had a problem of gettting into stalemates fast. The defensive bonuses of structures/ships and the (imho) too high income of the home system would ensure no one could attack without getting obliterated, even if the defender was confined to his home base.
---
I haven't played since then, just bought the still wrapped stuff when I found it on ebay. Still plan to try it again and maybe house rule some stuff to make it more interesting once I have more time for it (retirement is only a good 30 years away ;) ).
---
If you have pointers on how to make the game more interesting, I'm all ears.
---
Bots can still loot. In fact, bots can probably loot the wrecks around an MTU much better than a player going "open, loot all, open, loot all" for fifteen minutes
---
Phew. Finally someone with a working brain.
---
Sorry but i disagree.       
---
NPC stations are much better than NPC citadels.          
---
They are NPC owned and should not provide tether so when you undock - you are vulerable, thus you cannot undock whole fleet and position it under tether.          
---
People also like undock games in various kinds. It provides us sometimes with amazing killmails.
---
dude can't even make friends with NPCs. feels bad
---
Yeah I've noticed the indy indexes dropping all over, struggle is real.
---
Unique star gates in npc null and drone regions would be nice. (Maybe some infestation around or on the gates in drone regions.))
---
I'd be happy if they just upped the corporation bookmark limit my god 500 is a really dumb limit.
---
I'm all for NPC stations in many regions for different reasons.
---
But you and suitonia are wrong. It won't help significantly combat botting.
---
The reason why subcap bots don't die is not that people hunting them can't reach these regions. It's that it's extremely unrewarding to hunt bots at the current pace. You kill them by triangulating their warpback timer. That can take over an hour or more just for a VNI kill. And then there is the issue that that timer can actually be randomized.
---
You want to cure botting? That will have to include a change about local.
---
Sky box skins
---
I would rather have some more sky box's that are not all nebula, space is meant to be black but fly through amarr space for example and all you see is gold in every direction.
---
More empty black space pls/.
---
I did wonder why I'm Minmatarian when my dad is Amarrish
---
Fishing, and dodging the dingos
---
This player "gets it."
---
This was pretty much my reaction too. I honestly don't notice issues with the current ones.
---
This won’t work because every botmaker Will just inject their own custom hash.
---

Asking for a friend...
---
succinct summary of current NCPL mentality
---
NPC space in dronelands has been something we as players have been asking for since 2012 (and even before)
---
Indeed. The real space is much darker and blacker.
---
It was always the people, not the game. The game is a sandbox, and kinda a good one that is. It allows people to generally do what they want to do.
---
And guess what, people generally want to be safe at home, and try to make their home a safer place. Even if they want some pvp content just as you. They just usually want it elsewhere. And guess what - that "elsewhere" is another bunch of people's home.
---
People will always find a way to be safe. If you think eve of 8 years ago was less safe, you're missing something. Ask someone about droneregions of 2010-2011.
---
You can't just persuade bunch of people to deliberately give up some safety for some "content", it's never happening.
---
That's the problem, it screws over a chunk of players just so a handful of ppl can have a safe harbour.  All an NPC cluster will do is kill off a sizeable chuck of content for the hunters and those that live there.  Drone regions are too densely packed, it would give you far more coverage than any other existing region.
---
It was limited to 250 not that long ago
---
What bookes do you have and where can i get them ?
---
A better solution would be a change regarding local something like an event that will remain ... for example "one day per week local might drop due to Concord issue" ... then it's not a failure and every normal player will simply be more careful whilst you can farm botters. Won't be a solution in general, but maybe on the long run it might hurt wallets.
---
Ofc there are other solutions as well like with what alphas can fly, injectors and so on ... but local is such a hot topic, it will probably be a joy for tons of people.
---
Rekking Crew is not PANFAM
---
I have no objection to an NPC area in droneland IF other changes are made in the process to offset it slightly.  My main issue is that the place everyone wants NPC space gives you coverage of 300+ systems.  The dronelands are too densely packed, the would need spreading out or something else.
---
What I object to is everyone suggesting it's a simple fix without considering the wider impact.  EVE is a complex system you can't make a change without looking at the wider picture.
---
Basically, we, the players, have to band together to take down these mighty empires. 
---
It's just gotten a bit out of hand. I guess the best bet today would be to install independent, happy sov owners in constellations that are currently rentals, starting with the easiest to take. Let these guys grow while you repeat the process at a slow but steady pace. Eventually you have probably doubled your numbers, or at least increased the number of supers you can bring to a fight that matters with the help of all those new independent dudes. One day the biggest rental empires can become valid targets too.

I don't judge game proposals by thinking about isolated small mechanics or lore rationales about that NPCs should or should not do. I judge them by the amount (and value) of killmails they will generate. 
---
Mega alliances can prevent dreads/blops fleets from undocking by merely having 1 at the keyboard blockade runner each system (plus the usual umbrella). That's a lot of killmails denied in value and amount. Way more than what we currently have with station games. That'll happen if you have an NPC station in the range of Eso and other umbrella space.
---
You wanna cure ultra safe spaces, overfarming, proliferation, umbrellas, lack of content, lack of wars? You give everyone their base of ops to threaten most regions with dreadbombs. And you remove hurdles people have to operate these dreadbombs.
---
And as I said in the other post, these stations won't help vs. botting. So their only value is killmail generation.
---
Por que no los* dos
---
EVE 8 years ago was less safe since you didn't have travelceptors, not everyone had a JF and dropping 20 carriers on anything that moved wasn't really a thing yet. Sure you had remote regions where you could rat in safety but you still had awkward chokepoints where people would get caught, such as LXQ, BWF, KBP, EC-P8R and M-OE. My corp still has a bunch of ships lying around those systems but you'd find it real hard to get any real content there since the only real traffic is travelceptors and the empires themselves have easily accessible JFs + super umbrellas to protect inside their region. Before you'd get people bringing some kitchen sink to try to remove you from the gate... Now you're but a minor nuisance that can easily be ignored.
---
Was there any mention of a steering group in that AMA? 
---
I came away with the perception that it was all "hypothesis" -&gt; "gating meeting to obtain budget". That smells very scrum to me. Agile doesn't work without process design and process design is driven by desired outcome.....
---
I few years ago I found a bug that caused nebulae not to load. It was glorious .   
---
CCP patched it unfortunately so I'm back to Las Vegas strip space and unreadable brackets.
---
Band together, bring down bunch of mighty empires... Well, that sounds like erecting even stronger empire in their place, isn't it?
---
Will it actually change anything besides new labels on sov map?
---
I agree actually, though I'm not sure if your prescription will cure the problem.  Making renting bannable, negwalletable, etc. if discovered would be some progress.  But this wouldn't affect Goons.  It would greatly affect everybody in null who isn't Goons though.  So the net result is Goons strengthened, Goon rivals weakened (they seem pretty clear they don't intend to change).  That's not going to result in more fights is it.
---
No let’s not muddy the waters of the bot solution debate. Npc stations, although cool, won’t do anything to combat botting. It’s a red herring.
---
Even if renters are gone your 50 man alliance won't stand up to the might of any of the mega coalitions fleets to permit you to hold sov anywhere.
---
Even if the renters were gone the owners would not be happy to have you moving in and would still ward you off.
---
My group got Lucky we hold our own sov and we are now a small tip on the Daily sov map   ( muderous mindset) i have never enjoyed Eve as Mutch since we took sov and hold it
---
then you're a retard, sorry mate 
---
If your idea of fun is watching your screen for several hours, and the only thing you do is lock up and f1 every 5 minutes, you might as well watch a wall
---
Without renters, they can't sustain as many systems long term. So they can try to ward you off, but you are capable of using the space, and they aren't. Long term in such a scenario, if you're persistent, you win.
---
MTU raiding is very easy?
---
Even Imperium has renters. Supercap blobs and megacoalitions are also serious issues, there's no one magic fix for every problem, and I'm not saying only one fix should be applied, but killing rental empires is probably the single best game health improvement available.
---
Not to mention the whole part where Keepstars are literally undefendable against critical mass of Titans, so if you don't want to play the dumb Titan ball vs Titan ball 12 hour autism grind unanchoring and re-anchoring in a month is just the obvious solution.
---
Since he is not running this year - look into Stitch Kaneland's CSM campaign - he is respected solo-small gang player - with decent knowledge and a well suited replacement to Suit on the CSM - he will have one of my votes.
---
Test...
---
I the books are told, you have tousend of crew man on an BS. Basicly, as capsual Pilot you will habe only a small BattleCrew on them.
---
And think about, if you pay a crewman 4k ISK per Year. Thats nice income.
---
This some new meme
---
this is way different then back then though. The "small" guys are far more outnumbered then goons were back then. Also there are no way any alliance will catch up to goons in number of titans
---
i want to habe a killcount for my Crewmans they spent there lives in my Ship ...
---
Of course but Imperium can take them or leave them.  They're not at all a force multiplier (in economic terms) to Goons as they are to some other alliances.
---
Not sure if this is a good idea, but I'd somehow want to see what would happen with a change that meant holding sov over systems that are far from your capital system was increasingly harder. Like systems 15 jumps from your capital are extremely harder to maintain within your sov space than systems within 5 jumps, etc.
---
And changes that would make it harder to deploy caps fleets at the outer edges of your sov space than in the middle of it.
---
At the same time I feel nothing can really counterbalance the fact that if you get a huge number of players together, you'll always end up with a situation similar to this somehow.
---
skill farming without any ancillary income stream is profitless
---
I'd say the problem is the renters. Nothing is stopping them from taking space, they choose to rent. They just want a little system to krab in with no responsibility.
---
Check the new post out today.
---
You are right the decay falls back to normal trading volume. It didn't create a new "plateau" if you will.
---
because it removes any chance of a coalition ever having as many titans as imoerium
---
You are not capable of using the space under their umbrella any more than you are today.
---
Yeah aren't you guys lowsec pvp lol
---
For PIBC it must be like "what? are we back home?" :D
---
"EVE is harsh! It doesn't cater to you! Every ship you fly should be fit for PVP! If you lose something it's your fault!"
---
"CCPls remove local, tether, gatecloak, warp stabs, give freighters a fifteen minute align time, and let my corp anchor a citadel with a permanent bubble above it outside every trade hub"
---
Do you have your raw data on hand, if you don’t mind sharing?
---
Right now everybody and their mother are piling up in these 3-4 huges alliances (goons, test, ph, frat), which in my opinion is a huge blow to content creation.
---
Being conquered and occupied for four years doesn't sound like winning to me.
---
here have an upvote. Rental empires are a fucking cancer and encourage botting, even if they aren't one of the purposes they exist, to start with. Also with the rest of your post, you're right. However there is nobody who would remove rental empires, since its a source of easy RMT ISK for both parties, the renter and the space lord.
---
The fucking ball caps. You know, I don't mind so much the cosmetic stuff, but who the fuck wants to dress their badass space captain like some dumbfuck 20 year old who still goes to high school parties
---
Maybe just use that fancy neural network to turn it into 4K?
---
A smaller group comprised mainly of &lt;1 year old newbies LOL !!
---
asking for ccp to step in because you cant do anything about a 1300 member alliance holding 7 regions just shows how pathetic the rest of the game really is
---
instead of asking for ccps help either stop being lazy and attack the space or admit you dont actually want it you just want easy content because you suck against anyone who fights back
---
The book with all the signatures, was that in relation to that CREST API challenge a few years back?
---
Dont worry, Goons will surely report that bug to ccp ... they always did ... after exploiting and milking these bugs ...
---
"there’s basically no room left for small groups looking to hold even one or two systems."
---
there is no point of holding one or two systems if you don't blue your neighbors.  You won't be able to use it and people will take constant pot shots at you.  Just look at the regions where systems are switching hands.  There is essentially zero usage of those systems.  
---
What you are asking for is something like the old DCU of the drone lands.  A bunch of "independent" alliances under the banner of the the DCU which were blued up.  Or the current legacy system which is a bunch of independent alliances under the banner of Legacy that are blued up.  
---
Independent alliances don't exist because they don't make sense.  You can't do anything if you are surrounded by enemies at all times.  Ratting and mining ships are just easy pickings.
---
you have been banned for RMT, still RMT and have been recorded exploiting multiple times
---
i doubt they're gonna let you run
---
it also makes tactical sense to weaken your enemies without fighting a single battle, taking out structures even before they started to move.
---
It's a good idea in theory, unfortunately it won't stop botting. Also, why would drones create stations? CCP would have to introduce interactable rogue drone hives. We all know that rogue drones do not like anything or anyone. Might as well make Sleeper stations and Triglavi....too late.
---
Honestly I don't know a solution to botting, I'm neither a developer or coder, or whatever designation you need to do that stuff. As long as people can RMT there will be bots. As long as people can play Omega without paying there will be bots. As long as people can amass huge wallets just for the sake of being the Bill Gates of space people will bot. That's just the nature of the beast. 
---
And you are going to say 'it's not a solution to botting, it's just a way to make those regions less secluded and safe'. That I am all for. I'm just saying that the harder we make botting, the harder these kids who make bots will work to make better bots.
---
test should go diaf. lmao.
---
"security reasons".. my ass. spin in harder.
---
Just have it do a billion damage per second ignores resistance. Boom, job done
---
Evidently, I don’t know how Eve lasted this long with that kind of mindset.
---
long ago when you could set a safespot in system by using the galaxy map i dud this and set a safespot that was nearly 7k au towards the gate... needless to say it took a while and quite some attempts to warp that far... but i can confirm there was zero change in the skybox
---
Let me guess, you're an old school software engineer that thinks more people ought to code games in python
---
Way back in the early days of EVE it was actually an object that would blow up your ship. Then CCP got limp, and has stayed limp.
---
When did your uncle touched you? Tell us
---
Hedliner practices Sort Dragon diplomacy with less sugar talking. This was inevitable.
---
just google trash and print it out
---
In what universe does a 100 member alliance take even one system off of an alliance of 1300?
---
Yes and no. Its impossible to overwhelm these empires. You need to eat at it with cloaky campers. Killing ratters. Denying content. Make holding that sov not worth it.
---
Can I haz your stuff?
---
Yet nullsec areas were they are botting is waaaaay more limited.
---
If your using Google sheets lookup GESI, it's a prebuilt addon that's you can use to get ESI data.
---
proved me wrong there, good boi
---
Exactly. Wouldn't be hard to implement.
---
&gt; Renter empires choke the fuck out of sov null, moreso than anything else in the game.
---
It's been proven in the past and currently that a small group can hold a constellation or a few systems if they are persistent enough to do so. It's just easier and cheaper to stick alts in a renter group or Goons/TAPI/PH to do carebearing in nullsec. So this is why you have what you have in nullsec these days.
---
&gt;The defensive bonuses of structures/ships and the (imho) too high income of the home system would ensure no one could attack without getting obliterated, even if the defender was confined to his home base.
---
ok now talk abput the card game
---
I thought CCP didn't allow EVE to be launched inside a virtual machine. I've just been using WINE. How do you do it?
---
how is skillu a "mighty empire"? its 1300 members (even less when they took the space) who pvp exclusively and essentially sell their ability to pvp to people who want to rat behind them 
---
self proclaimed pvp pilots hating on skillu are just a bunch of foxes wishing they could reach the grapes
---
Can't tank the /kill command
---
A cultural victory.  What other victory conditions are there, apart from not logging in?
---
Yeah - The only real test for it I've found is simply actively hunting areas with super consistently high NPC/h kills and seeing how the ships react. Sometimes they react like players because they're just turbokrabs, other times they actually are bots and [you can fuck them up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKKnUwOBCOs).
---
Yeah, half your targets locked are now random asteroids/structures.
---
Reeeeeeely
---
well skillu took their first couple as a 150 man alliance vs 20000 so uh, new eden i guess?
---
Nice! I have that same Rifter right next to my monitor connected to a free USB port, with the yellow light shining.
---
Someone doesn't know how to setup brackets.
---
I have only my basic data taken from the eve client ~400days or so. I can share on googlesheets? PM me a google email if you have one. Or how would be the best place to host/share a raw xls? I don't do the new fangled computers with the sharing and the hosting and the dirtbox.
---
Its because most of Eves content is created by the players. We simply don't need polished content from CCP. We need tools that allow us to manipulate sand. Even if the tools are clunky, we will find a way.
---
Right now is the only period of Eve that I am aware of where the building tools are so far ahead of the weapons. We need more guns from CCP to match the butter.

A 100 person alliance can fight a devestating war of attrition thats extremely hard to do anything about with the right tactics.

My experience has been that it locks them even if the brackets aren't visible. Just like you can 'look at' a planet if you square over it or click right at the correct spot, even if the planet icon doesn't show. Maybe it got changed lately idk.

Skybox skins, only 695 plex / system!
---
"solid"
---
if you're measuring "solid" based on the current meta of rorq mining, then you, sir, are correct
---
You are missing important part here.         
---
Bots are bots.      
---
If you enter a system, quite often get near "safe up".        
---
Current desolate areas allow them to have almost 23/7 uptime.      
---
If some hunter/neutral moves in the area twice a hour you are easily reducing this uptime by 50%.              
---
**1. Access to NPC locations allows a lot of neutral movement affecting how long bots can rat undisturbed**            
---
Bots are also bots sometimes they break.     
---
Botting ships sit in space or totally lose their "mind".       
---
People killed supers/capitals that totally ignored attackers and continued ratting. You will find examples of this on youtube.           
---
**2. Increased movement allows people to detect bugged bots, thus allowing gathering easy evidence** ^(fact that CCP don't act on this is other issue)             
---
Renter organizations allow easy bot harboring - like **no one have any doubts about it**        
---
"Somehow" the renter areas are in those desolate, hard to access regions.      
---
Introducing a NPC staging points allow easier contest of such space.     
---
What can **lead to reduce in overal renter areas**.       
---
This can allow more small groups to get space or contest the space.          
---
Like recent events proved - NC cannot defend own renter space, same for XX earlier. For sure those "holy rental and so on" cannot be easily defended if there are contestors.     
---
Why no one is touching drone lands and it is constantly under renter flag? Because people controlling the logistic lines control the area.    
---
Now if there is no issue with logistics, situation changes.           
---
**3. NPC routes and NPC staging location ease the contest of the area. This can lead to reduced renter space**
---
Papa Goon called him off. Provi is the target of their upcoming deployment.

---

---
Amen.
---
Stop complaining about things that aren't a problem. Giant nullblocs packing their space with krabs are at least as cancerous as rental empires, and usually much harder to attack. The reality is that there is more space than you could ever densely fill. at the same time, there are people who want to live in space without having to defend it, and there are people who want to generate income from space without having to krab. Even if you brought passive moon mining or other pvp-oriented income back, people would still rent space simply because of the supply and demand. There's a reason why every single null block has renters - Imperium (Fountain/Period Basis), Legacy (Paragon Soul, Feyth and previously Omist), Panfam (B0T/WERMT/BNSTK), Frat, REEK, everyone in drones, etc etc.  
---
Content mechanics are a CCP issue. I also firmly believe that any really determined group, even if small, could take space in multiple parts of the map atm. There are some absolutely trash alliances, and some decent small ones, holding space. And yeah, they're affiliated with one or other block but so would anyone who moved in. In truth most of the people capable of holding space already have it.
---
Did you tweeted it.     
---
Sorry but CCP requested player input using the CCPlease tag.

This is valid input.

This post. I am not in a point in the game where I can say that I care about botters but that sov mechanic...
---
I am in a smalltime corp and we want to get out of care-bear sec to get us a piece of null, only now starting to realise we'll need to somehow get enough people to be able to field a fleet with caps and supercaps to even dream of getting even ONE system. Looking into sov warfare, which honestly looks like "Defend the laser pointer" to me is hugely discouraging.
---
Now that I see that we can't kick some renters out because if we threaten someone's isk supply they'll rain fucking 12km long space dildos on us, what's the point of even trying?
---
Anyone got advice? I wanna live a rent free pvp life.

CCP is selling something they've already done, so the concept of new development is not relevant. :)

have it be a super massive wormhole that randomly spits you out into a j-space system with no return hole. But it would change for each person, so even if you took a fleet there, most people would end up in different holes

Are there any good programs or sites i can use to calculate how much raw moon goo i need to build 100 sabres for example ? i.e. calculating it from simple reaction up to the ship, including manufacturing taxes etc. 
---
I have made my own excel sheet, but there's always something small that I am a little off with.. Kind of tired of struggling to perfect it. 
---
Eve-industry only gives me half of the bill of materials.
---
Atleast that's better than 0/10 :D
---
Not really. The idea of depletion the more you run them would scale with the amount of people in the alliance. A small alliance has less people and the sites would deplete slower unless you have a turbo krab. Sure, the diamond rat infestation would become a pain but you just beat them back, as a group, this wouldn't take that long. Smaller alliances could also make full use of their systems as well by running all of the sites, not just the havens and sanctums, as well as the relic sites and random combat anomalies. Yes, this idea does mean that there is less overall static isk coming into the game but that's the whole point. It encourages different pve activity to make your isk.  As far as ore anomalies, for smaller alliances those will deplete a lot less rapidly since they don't have 20 rorqs in a system, but for the large alliances that can rolls 3 colossal a day easily, it will at least somewhat impact them. It gives a more equal footing between large and small. You will never truly bridge the wealth gap at this point. The only way to do that is to nerf income while providing incentive to destroy what exists/make it more possible.
---
&gt; And the best part is, they won it primarily through assigning drones to asteroids and clicking Start on industry jobs.
---
Truly, our minds were at their zenith when we discovered that the best way to make supercaps is to not immediately shit all over the folks who generate the raw materials for and assemble said raw materials into new supercaps.
---
Or QFC if you are wanting to shoot mans
---
BoB happened because of a toxic culture which has since been mostly cleared up, Imperium imploded in WWB because of I Want ISK funding WWB, and I Want ISK has disappeared.
---
The depressing facts are that there is nobody left to flip. everyone is firmly invested in their respective alliances. This is the endgame and nothing is going to change.
---
It is very telling that the most recent major flip (The Judge) from CO2 to Imperium was because CO2 was imploding (this was after gigX got b&amp;, right?) and The Judge was not really invested in CO2 anymore.

If only the mechanics would make it harder to play the more bigger your group is. For example resources/rewards diminishing the more you mine/rat in a system/region. It would reward smaller groups and spreading around the map more. Would make currently empty systems extremely valuable.
---
Looks at username ... medication still not strong enough.
---
I'm already on the CSM. I'm stepping down in a months time.
---
I fought a one-man campaign against a 2000 man alliance and managed to take sov that to this day remains out of their control (though not mine).
---
Renters still fuck it up so heavily that any sort of realistic formation of a group that shares this mentality will usually be replaced by "why not just go to a bloc and get a ton of safe krabbing space?"
---
The barrier to entry is just too high.
---
This is a dumb topic.

Makes zero sense to limit the number of Corporation bookmarks while player bookmarks is unlimited. I'll take that increase yes, but it's still very low.

It would be fantastic if they would stop allowing one region's nebula to be seen so clearly from anothers space.  It is super shitty to have all these hideous colors clogging up what could otherwise be a beautiful starscape.
---
And like, why the hell can we see *certain* nebulas from the other side of the star cluster?  Its bad enough i have to see that hideous piss yellow amarr tumor everywhere i go in the south.  I dont also need to see Jove space or w/e that puke green stain is way up north when im sitting in minmatar ghetto space.
---
Well you're welcome to roam provi :) content is always welcome.
---
it is retarded that the whole game is about empire building. ncpl beeing open for krabbing doesn't make any difference since you can't compete to a much larger group anyways. any possibility to win wars by superior doctrine/skilled fc's or whatever is basically dead. thanks to rorqs and injectors, everybody has instant access to any ship at any given time. 
---
I am just surprised that the goon linemember can actually enjoy the game when there is basically 0 content in delve besides mining and ratting
---
You can't, but I can guarantee if anyone ever did build a titan there somehow or the rules where to be changed as such, it would die horribly. You can build a carrier in one, and unless you're part of an alliance, it will likely die.
---
It looks like something designed to help bots and discourage travel.
---
&gt; A. Access to NPC locations allows a lot of neutral movement affecting how long bots can rat undisturbed
---
The downtime from this is not as significant as you think it is. You/Suitonia are talking about pure botlands. There is no reason for anyone to roam in most of these systems except for bots.
---
&gt; B. Increased movement allows people to detect bugged bots, thus allowing gathering easy evidence
---
Yes. The very least that'd come from these stations might be more reports, which is why botters do it in remote systems to begin with. Yet reports/bans hasn't been effectlvely overwhelmed botting, and that'll most likely won't change. People find a way to launder money, inject new accounts and stay profitable until the next banwave.
---
&gt; C. NPC routes and NPC staging location ease the contest of the area. This can lead to reduced renter space
---
Meh. If you have forces/willingness to invade some botlands deploying a Fortizar won't be an important obstacle against that. The reasons why people don't invade botter space (or any space) anymore are an entirely different set.
---
&gt; the best way to make supercaps 
---
Hmm, why did you figure it out so late with brains at zenith and the "others" had the largest Super-Fleet for close to a decade?
---
I can tell you, it needed a meta-breaking patch in "Lifeblood" that heavily favoured the Farms&amp;Fields-Life over the Hunt&amp;Shoot-Life. You adapted perfectly to the new meta, that is your victory yes. But without this patch you would not be near where you are now.
---
One time? And how much is that payment?
---
Believe it or not, after being part of the coalition I have started to dislike Test more and more, just as much as Goons, nothing personal they both have decent dudes but I’m mostly talking about the leadership and how they fuck shit up.

---
No, join the good guys and come fly with pandemic horde.
---
Jokes aside you a lots of options. Do not bother wasting your time mining in high sec solo. Join a group of players called an alliance. Eve uni is a good start, less pvp but also less money.
---
If you do not mind pvp join a null sec block, Brave, Test,goons and pandemic horde all have new bro corps. In pandemic horde you will be give you skill books for free as well as a care pack of ships. If the rumours are true Goons and us are about to go to war. 
---
They are declaring war on us, so we must be the good guys.
---
I picked you guys because you are sometimes involved in the provi fighting on the HTP/rekking crew side (so part of the "lets go shoot provi together when we aren't shooting each other" coalition) and were the first name outside of those two that came to mind, I am sincerely sorry for making any sort of perceived comparison to the bastion.
---
I've seen this mostly done with T2/pirate frigates, would a cheapish T1 frigate be able to do this as well, or is there an issue with bot/site DPS, or your own output, or such that prevents it from being viable?
---
I actually miss those.  They were constellation based rather than region and allowed you to pick one that you liked.  That is why i originally settled to minmatar space near rens back in 2005/2006 ish.  I really liked that blue/black gradient environment.
---
This is heresy
---
They don't care what machine or what setup you use as long as you respect the EULA. If you use if to run alpha alongside omega accounts or bots, it's a different story.
---
WTB is what brought us full circle to this and we won't make the same mistake afterwards.
---
As I have said in other comments there needs to be a more comprehensive update to nullsec (and empire, low sec and WHs).  What you are are suggesting with the NPC areas is pissing on a raging fire, you might deal with a few minor local issues but it doesnt fix the wider issues.
---
We’ve always shown up to our own fortizar defenses, unlike panfam.

Grinding for space police ride

Sorry to hear about your RL. Hope it works itself out and you come back to the game again.
---
Skillu is a mighty empire in the sense that it has a solid scap fleet, 1300 motivated, well skilled nerds and the funding to run expensive but great fleet comps. Not having bad fcs also helps. 
---
Unless some groups band together to split you attention over multiple regions (and even then) its unfeasable for a small group to take even a system of you long term. Its the same for the other big groups.
---
Kicking a bloated corpse is easier thsn kicking a dude with a giant sixpack.
---
All it took was utilizing the space we live in, instead of living in the past
---
Nah. The supercap powers of yesteryear were built by aggressively poaching the entire universe's supply of homegrown supercap pilots. It's easy to build a superfleet when you can just take them from the entire game's player base. Not only do you build your own superfleet, but you reduce the size of the supercap fleet belonging to those hostile to you.
---
Besides, you forget that drone poo existed, which was a mineral faucet even larger than rorquals. I remember 2 isk trit.
---
Let's say goons win this one and panfam is completely kicked out of relevance. Who do y'all fight next year? Or would it then be time to go full Serenity?
---
Maybe you're right. I didn't get much traction with this back on CSM 9, but maybe it's time to resurrect it.

---
I don't drink any alcohol, so I wouldn't know if they are any good :)
---
I roam null so I understand the sentiment... but you're asking CCP to step in and alter an arrangement thousands of players dedicate part of their play time to create. It does not unfairly exploit the game, except for when the renters are also botters. Your proposal is basically "would'nt it be nice if CCP kicked over the big bloc sand castle in support of my playstyle because my group isn't strong enough to do it". They 100% should not intervene in this way. It goes entirely against the idea of providing a sandbox and letting the players build whatever they want.
---
Your asumption is false. Sorry.
---
Look about germinate. The easiest access NS because close to jita. It was full of bot before ph came here. And not now.
---
Branch is really not hard to access, close to 2 npc nulsec space and is full of bot at the moment.
---
Period basis is close to npc nullsec and there is and was a lot of bot.  We can find other exemple.
---
The main fuel of botting is RMT. While you cant live on rmt in the west, it s possible in China / Russia. It depends on the people living in the space. Well, of course it s easier to bot in a far away space.
---
You say that like its a bad thing, being paid to do something you like is awesome :)
---
I agree with the sentiment. If any bloc was ever closer to total Eve domination, it's today's Imperium. That reflects a lot of game issues though.
---
One question is how motivated people are to break their blue donuts. The blue donut isn't measured by the portion of the map that's blue, or by the number of alliances bluing each other. It's measured by the number of individual people blue to each other. That ratio has never been as high as today.
---
A coalition living in different regions can be easily motivated to break (e.g. WWB). Members of a coalition living in same region, using the same umbrella, is more dependent on each other. Fozzie anoms brought biggest coalitions under the same umbrella, and forced many people to join biggest alliances. 
---
As more and more people began living dependent on each other, this created ginormous cohesive entities impossible to break. And when one side has double amount of titans than the rest of Eve, and they can replace them twice faster, then the sov warfare game is already over. Nobody will fight them. And they won't break their donut, because their dominance ans asset growth is ensured by that donut.
---
It's kinda sad.
---
Think about it. If someone wins a sandbox game, then it means the game is over. Happened in Serenity.
---
r/thanksitsfixed
---
Exactly.  Even if NC. and co are pulling back to empire it shows tactical thinking over fear.  Why risk losing trillions to save a few billions when the odds are potentially heavily against you.
---
I don't think anyone doubts the scale of numerical superiority goons have but that's always been the best tactic in nullsec warfare.  If Imperium have hit the point where no-one can seriously challenge them well done, but blobbing always has one outcome - the blobbed eventually stopped fighting back.  Ultimately it's goon's content that dies, NC. etc will get to choose their fights whilst goons grind through empty structures and sov. We've already seen Initiative threaten resets when too many entities went blue - that's were the future lies many blues &amp; neutrals who deny fights.
---
Rental empires don't encourage botting. Dumb gameplay does. Especially now that farming has such a little income compared to rorqual.
---
PUBG
---
Simple solution player cap systems somewhere.
---
No battle caps.
---
That generates smal fights.
---
Ohh shit I'm talking about WH space my bad.
---
We need more WH space rules for normal space it is realy fun to fight smal gangs
---
That's fair, I'd be hesitant to open something that unique myself to be fair but the incorrigible ale hound in me is bursting to know, for science!
---
I've seen pics n heard stories that CCP used to sell/give out Quafe at events too, probably just relabelled coke of course but definitely another bucket list thing I'll probably never get to try!
---
Sorry i'll record my screen with my phone next time.
---
Think gigx got banned because he threaten to cut off the judges hands.
---
Yes hello?
---
Travel ceptors were a mistake, unironically. The very act of moving used to be nerve wracking, as there was a solid chance a small gang had set up a gate camp within your space to catch vulnerable targets while melting away at a response. It was actual harassment, and that very feeling of being vulnerable is what made nullsec nullsec.
---
Nowadays I just hop into a nullified, instawarping ceptor and can get wherever I want to go with impunity. Properly fit they're even relatively SB immune. Feeling safe in nullsec is just wrong, and the few times I find myself without a travel ceptor on hand just remind me of how scary feeling vulnerable used to be, and honestly I miss it.

Translation: Imperiu. won. If the only strategy is to retreat, then by definition the aggressor is victorious. Will there be a group to unseat Goons or oppose Goons? Probably not, Goons seem quite content carebearing it up and living with the blueballing.
---
Remember that time we lit a cyno on station and i jumped my titan into the station bouncing the cap fleet out of range if docking.
---
Renters are typically ISK making alts or bots. There's very few renting corps around that are actual players, because why would they rent when most groups would be more than happy to absorb even the most braindead group of turbokrabs to bolster their numbers.
---
Same shit right
---
For a few weeks, maybe.
---
That's close enough from Goons and INIT.

Goddammit guys, FC said MWD off when you go into the WH.

Assuming NS wars are the game goal.

https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14 is a nice list of useful skills. The 2 you especially want at V are Capacitor Management and Capacitor Systems Operation.

There are a lot of cap regen mods, but you should not need them to run a passive Gila. https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Capacitor

I've been in Provi long enough to have seen this group form into what it is today. There is a reason that we called them HTPL years ago; they have been pets for ages. Additionally, both Waffles and PHEW are ex PL. They are still friends, and for those of us who were evicted by NCPL multiple times, the fight isn't over.
---
Content is dead in null.
---
WH space is what EvE should be. Small fights no TIDI love it.
---
&gt;It is very telling that the most recent major flip (The Judge iirc) from CO2 to Imperium was because CO2 was imploding (this was after gigX got b&amp;, right?) and The Judge was not really invested in CO2 anymore.
---
That's just completely wrong mate.
---
We were never going to implode in impass. We propably would have lost the war eventually but that doesn't mean we would have imploded anytime soon.
---
And with a risk of miscalibrating if it’s one way, as it was when the gates were first built. Just read the story of [Old Man Star.](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/old-man-star/)
---
it does.. its renter's "they don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck" whole mentality which is key factor to this.
---
You sure seem like someone who is having fun
---
encouraging and not giving a fuck are definitely not the same thing.
---
If you want to mine either join a low class wormhole corp or join nullsec corp. Make sure they have a mining focus or they will reject you. It takes relatively little skills to mine effectively.
---
Pandemic Legion bombers were batphoned when we were removing a friggin astrahous because RC was going to lose a fight and they are giant babies.

You do realize goons offer PB for rent pretty much free, just to fuck with other rental empires?

Can you add there something about space adjustments like the NPC areas mentioned in suitonia post. 
---
TY
---
Citidels are a big thing now. Basically they are player stations.
---
Makes wormhole life 100% more bearable and makes sov 100% less fun due to structure grinding.
---
It is still better than doing nothing.
---
When every batphone is panfam youve gotta call a spade a spade
---
It already started to gather ideas that aren't even remotely sensible 😢
---
[And this is how it works for me.](https://i.imgur.com/zuruNur.gifv)
---
I switch to a tab that has all objects hidden, and yet it locks the containers and attempts to lock sentries.
---
There's some inconsistency because whether it locks invisible objects, depends on how you place the square. Also it's more likely to lock everything if you just switched tabs. I went through every setting in the overview and none changed how it works.
---
this is good
---
why does nobody else post like this?
---
I fully agree with this statement. CCP is to blame for this completely. Allowing a single entity to become so powerful in EVE without any contest has destroyed the sand box. theres no more sand to play with anymore. CCP or rather the CSM did a very good job of catering to only one style of game play. and it created a vacuum of power that cant be easily undone. I fully believe that the CSM did nothing to help ballance out the game. It only supplied Boughten out elections which lead to untouchable mega block formation. it deeply saddens me to see that there is no honest content drivers for eve. FCs having to inform eachother that they are forming in order to get fights, even down to arranging fights for "fun" not even real content. id say about 75% of the content in Null is rorq saves. Which most of that comes from WHers (props there guys). Even being in TEST has made me see this. And im fairly new to null as a whole only living there for about 3 years now. When "tactical blueballing" is a mechanic in eve culture thats pretty sad. the spamming of citadels or rather the unchanged timer setup of them creates "conflict drivers" that isnt even fun to play. CCP has to either figure out a way to make the game lively again or wipe everyones sand castle down and own up to the fact they fucked up. there seems to be no new content that CCP can provide that a mega group cant dominate and expliot. so it all comes back the vacuum of power that has been left unchecked. But whats there left to do?... 
---
o7 Fly Dangeroulsy
---
I kinda hoped that the Chinese coming over to this server was going to create new interesting content! With them trying to carve out some space for their own! But no they blue test (surprised pikachu)
---
And get given space to quietly krab down there
---
The word is tactical withdrawal when done on your own terms.
---
TL;DR:
---
1. with no plex for $$$ sale in sight, prices of it will skyrocket even more. 
---
2. SP farming is not profitable with current prices.
---
3. If you have ISK to invest and you did not buy PLEX when the "sale" ended, you dumb.
---
Goons might be the most powerful entity but there always is one.  When BoB or NC or whoever was the most powerful entity the game carried on.  There is still plenty of game that can be had if you ignore goons out the picture.
---
As with most entities if you kill off the the majority of the content sources you die.  If goons can't get decent fights their PvPers will leave/stop playing and the alliance's power declines until someone moves in and takes the crown.  To borrow from BSG "all of this has happened before and will happen again"
---
Cannot be encapsulated into ONE change. :(
---
1) Remove PLEX
---
2) Remove Skill Injectors
---
3) Reset Tranquillity
---
No you misunderstand, I mean know when the corps I have in my rental alliance have characters banned for it.  Some kind of indication or notification to let me know to look into a specific corp.  Unless CCP wants to pay me, I'm not going to hunt 200 blue systems across 3 regions on the off chance there might be a bot, but I absolutely follow up on reports people give me about botlike behavior on specific toons.  A report about bots banned per corp would be just as good so I can follow up.
---
The poaching was a thing for sure, but also they were letting Renters build their Supers in Dronelands because of fucktons of cheap Minerals. A lot of the first BoT-Renters never paid an ISK rent, they paid with Supers.

&gt;at the same time, there are people who want to live in space without having to defend it, and there are people who want to generate income from space without having to krab
---
I don't see why this needs to be a thing. I believe that people "want" that, but i can think of no argument as to why this "should" be possible.
---
does security department of a mall not giving a fuck about theft encourage theft? I mean not giving a fuck is not the same as encouraging, yet in certain context it is.
---
No, that's bollocks, there are times where doing a half arsed solution is worse than doing nothing.
---
The rorqual is a good example, it would have been far better to leave it as a compression and boosting ship that turning it into the monster miner CCP first did.  It's only after several passes and serious damage done is barely acceptable.
---
Jesus fuck they don't even tell you who they banned/fined you for? That's insane.
---
It s closed yes, but outside the umbrella.
---
Switch tabs, dock/jump to another system and then try it again.
---
every single one of those ideas so far is pretty legit
---
Dumb is harsh. The comments I have been getting so far show that people just had no idea. Most people don't care until they do i.e. when they started losing money. Or rather gained less.
---
TEST cuddeling up to PanFam? Quite welcome I'd say. Although it may just be that they know they are next on the list when papa goons is finshed up north.
---
you know killboards doesn't actually show who was on grid right?   
---
if there was 200 from the imperium only shooting the keepstar, they wouldn't be on the br
---
Imperium were around 400 more in that fight.
---
Take your sov wands to either Etherium Reach or The Spire and grab some space! You may have to skirmish with other local entities but atm there are several small independent alliances grabbing a few systems for themselves.
---
I like the Overseer's effects idea.  But won't bots just derp over and scoop? Somebody will still have to sell the loot though, which is a mild inconvenience compared to a wallet tick.
---
I had high hopes for CCPlease and it failed.
---
Essentially it's just an AD website showing some things they may put in.
---
I was looking forward to having a website where people could input ideas to make the game better and have actually players vote on. Then if an idea got enough votes/popular then CCP would could look at adding it.
---
There is a lot of significance between the label on the sov map reading "RENTER FEDERATION" or "INDEPENDENT ENTITY".
---
You roam into renter space, they gone.
---
You roam into someone's home constellation... they wanna play.
---
ohh nice less structure bash...
---
no it's not. It becomes when they don't give a fuck about some and give a fuck about others.
---
If your security department does not give a fuck about thief, then they are not doing their job. They are not encouraging it.
---
It is not the job of rental empires to police the bots. The only players who actually encourage bots are those who use RMT sites.
---
Not surprising really. But you can always downvote them?
---
Or you could do it?
---
Now wouldn't it be hilarious if the war is some where else and all that moving was for naught... I was told by a little bird that the war is against BOT.
---
Yup, but that slows down a bots progress. It also means if you do manage to catch someone who's been turbokrabbing/botting for 3 hours, you actually get a decent % of all that ratting time - Imagine catching a bot and getting 40% of 6 hours of ratting and having to try and get it out of Nullsec alive, that's not only an incentive to try and catch them that's way bigger than a 60m VNI kill, it's also an interesting story!
---
you need a fax alt even if you don't have a super.
---
wow classic beta tho, let's focus on stuff that matters!
---
I like the last one, where we were looking at cell (structures?) Cant remember exactly, but it seemed easier than the current project...thoughts?
---
its both. the one who gives you $ for your isk and the other who gives you space to farm it in peace.
---
TEST hasn't been fined by CCP at least as long as I've been here, but I have kicked reported bots from my own rental alliance in the past also.  I figure the chances of me stumbling across all of them on report follow ups are impossibly low, and I'd love to know when one gets found by CCP before it gets found by me.  Believe it or not we've not been negwalleted for any money KWG gave us.  Omist was certainly full of bots before we got here, but when we took over their rental we made it explicitly clear that whatever they used to do in the past, we don't condone nor want botting isk. If ADMs over the last 12 months are any indication, I think it did a pretty good job clearing those bots out too.  Omist went from a delve-like every system was ADM6 to only the best truesec systems being ADM6 almost overnight after we kicked out the first set we found and showed them we were serious about it.
---
I think what you meant is "the presence of rental empires encourages players to start farming corporation, and thus bots".
---
Which sounds like what you wrote, but actually is not.
---
Best part is that goons used to be the ones that didn't really care for "winning" as much as for "having fun". How the tables have turned
---
Sorry never used any of my supers or titans much, hope that doesnt blow any holes in you stupid theory
---
since they don't care, then they don't encourage.
---
Otherwise you are saying that dev who created a game where it's worth botting are encouraging it. And players who make this game lively make it worth botting. 
---
So according to this spirit of yours, every player is encouraging bots in eve by the simple fact that they are playing.
---
You say the myth is broken, yet people still talk about those supers like they matter...
---
Yeah but not stupidly far away like Tribute would be.
---
I've hated skill injectors since they came out, and 60 days in goons in like 2008 made me hate blobs. Next?
---
Great idea. One other use for it would be as a cut-scene when you biomass your character.  It flies in a pod, close to it, then vanishes into the "wormhole" and is erased from New Eden... But where is it? Is it really dead?
---
Not showing score, no list of all ideas sorted by popularity
---
nitpicking much, I see.
---
Now, I'm out of this.
---
It was actually the last
---
Doesn't Bots in NS use chat to check if there's a menace ? just pop someone in every system populated with bots. with admin rights it should be easy
---
yes, nitpicking as in "not saying something logically false".
---
I wasn’t here for the last one, wasn’t it about proteins? Also I find this one fairly easy once you get the hang of it or good at finding patterns.
---
Oh, hold on.  You invoke the overseer and get all your loots.  Not on a site-by-site basis.
---
[Help me in my cause!](https://i.imgur.com/GgRNC4F.png)
---
ah typical issue from my side.  
---
Reading  ^^all is hard
---
I'm in two minds about displaying the score for each. Ditto with a list by popularity.
---
Sort by date entered is something I'm thinking about. (along with totally revising how the site works on the frontend ;) )
---
Plenty of WH space left and rent free for any small group wanting to claim "sov" for a single system.
---
Nothing lasts, every member of every alliance has directly conflicting interests, the surest constant is human frailty.
---
You said you dipped to 16k "at the lowest".
---
And once again, the numbers of characters in an alliance does not matter. Horde is a good example, where most chars are/were alts and would not be there fighting.
---
What matters is actual characters that a side could realistically put on field. You don't seem to understand that, so I'd really prefer if you didn't reply with another version of "Their coalition was totally 65k people(which it clearly wasn't) and ours was 16k(which it clearly wasn't). That's the same as saying that your coalition right now is 150k and that PanFam is 12k.
---
But hey, I'm just gonna block you so I don't have to keep replying. Hopefully you'll realize how silly you sound.
---
I'm pretty certain people figured that out easily over a year ago when the first Titan clashes started happening.
---
Game is won until, if ever, GSF collapses. That's how the game works.
---
With the reduction of the progression ceiling by making accessibility to Titans easy, N+1 is now the only go-to.
---
This really. Why the fuck would you stay in an alliance were everytime you form, you either get blueballed or murdered. People don't fight goons if they aren't sure they'll win, as goons have nothing to loose really and everything to gain. Didn't you need to kill more than half a billion **a minute** to even make them really loose anything? The saddest part about the already replaced meme is that it isn't one.

you argue that I've should have written "presence of rental empires encourages" instead of "rental empires encourage"? Seriously?

You need 95% capacitor :p

I missed that, thanks for correction. Then I hope the new components will not be more rare than the regular T2 components. Normal T2 ships are already expensive enough. But probably not...
---
No
---
Everything was better in those days. We warped uphill both ways to the gate, and pilots had more respect for their FCs.
---
Are you a renter?
---
Not really a surprise now is it? Reminds me of how PGL basically told us during an op that something like X47 will not happen again, as we are not stupid enough to waste our precious supers and titans in an unwinnable slugfest. Ultimately it's up to goon linemembers to decide if they want to play EVE or Clicker Heroes.
---
At the time judge did his heist, CO2 Members were at a motivation high, totally backing up the decision of gigx to fuck backdoor diplomacy NIPs and just go to war.
---
But I can tell you that after the show ther were CO2-Members quitting the game, because they said if thats the new meta than fuck this game. 
---
So additional to being a complete dork judge also managed to hurt the game substatially.
---
Haha, only in RL ;)
---
Tl:dr
---
Eve is easy to bot because the pve content is static.  Its so predictable you can 'solve' how to beat it 100% of the time with no variation.
---
I murder all competition. Or nobody is this weird. Idk one of those.
---
Why in gods seven dicks would you want them to invade *highsec*? An economically uncapped NPC empire with OP, non-capsuleer flyable ships is the only way to combat the goonie menace right now.
---
Im fine with that...lol i buy 3 months omega at a time. Stop being cheap buy omega. Ccp wont need to force u to do so.
---
Neuts in local get whitelisted if you don't do anything eventually - That would also impact all regular players as well, unless they were easily identifiable as CCP alts doing it, which would defeat the purpose.
---
It still needed a full patch totally changing income sources from a balance between Farms&amp;Fields and Hunt&amp;Shoot towards "fuck the income of everybody that does not want to mine for hours" ...
---
Yeah. But i am dumb too. Bought PLEX at about 4,4M when the sale happened, if i was not dumb, i would have waited a while. :D
---
ESS' are way too easy to keep safe with Hellspawns/putting them on Citadel grids/etc IMO - If they reworked how ESS' worked, I could see that working too, but it would take more code than a change to the spawn table.
---
And how exactly is that anyone's fault but your own? you entitled fuck. They didn't have to give any form of catchup. They gave 3 extra days and you're crying for more or to just be handed everything for no reason other than "I pay my sub" you know who else pays omega? The people who clicked a button 16 times.
---
This is rigor. a state of the game and the poeople of the game are not the same thing. Especially as you misuse the term in your following answer. So NO the rental empires are NOT encouraging the bots, though their presence is.
---
This actually touching a serious problem, even if NC lost all its renting systems though could fight the "new" alliances for years. They just had to stay away from Goons/TAPI. For a alliance like NC/PL to run out of money they have to lose supers. line ships are just to cheep to matter.
---
Also - There's no incentive to interact with someone over PvE as the defender or attacker. The defender simply wants to leave, and the attacker only have to stop them doing that. It's a very binary set of gameplay decisions which makes them incredibly easy to automate.
---
It must be rough to have a mental issue where you can't just let something go; you have to physically prevent yourself from seeing words.
---
When it comes to putting characters on the field, the number of characters, total, informs that number. Quite well, in fact. The people in Horde weren't all "alts," and you have no way to actually prove that. It's just how you feel. Use actual data to support your point.
---
People with multiple accounts can multi vote in this just like in the csm elections
---
dammit ... What kind of other unnatural behaviour does bots show ? what kind of other weakpoint could be used ?
---
I wish I could get such frames or books. I wish I could enjoy the game as much but at the begining ... Nice collection dude ! :D
---
Actually hit rmt/bot empires, as we now who they are.

&gt; "Ze children used to make fun ov me in school," KillahBee recounted sadly. "Zey used to make fun ov my trench coat and Battlefield Earth t-shirt."

---
You're not even in the same universe as the point he is making.
---
should i feel embarrassed for the editor. This is horrible, i mean wow.. smh
---
As I go over in the article that's kind of the problem - Ratting bots operate the exact same way as players. That's why I think CCP needs to subtly shift how ratting works in order to better allow them to differentiate between a turbo krab who rats for 8 hours, and a bot that rats for 8 hours. Right now, those are practically indistinguishable, and given that most bots don't rat 23/7 it's understandable how the situation has gotten to the point it's at.
---
I fully agree. im still not against ideas that make smaller entities viable though, just haven't seen any good ideas, it needs to be "organic"
---
Imagine if the third largest entity in the game were in the exact same position 3 years ago but for some reason decide to let an alliance almost dead feeding for years
---
They actually play eve instead of posting about it
---
It’s possible because both party’s to this arrangement are people and can come to a mutually beneficial deal. Why shouldn’t that be possible. More to the point, how on earth would you force this not to be possible?
---
yeah changing the environment to make them show mistakes. Why not add a very basic hack on top of the can ?
---
Reminder that relaying to a deaf fleetmate is not hard, but they will be super grateful and you should always do it if the oppertunity arises.
---
haha "if you don't make a complain every week you're a bot and banned" lol
---
This. OPs salty mindset is degenerate and cancerous.
---
oof, getting mistaken for scanner in yoolcy.
---
Interesting idea. Issue that i see :        
---
* People are using alts to gather stuff (including salvaging bots).        
---
* If this final "mini boss" will be just normal rat with additional can it will change nothing.
---
i really hope the target is something else than tribute. would be hilarious
---
Sorry &gt;.&lt;
---
70% is jump capacitor for capital ships, I don’t know about the 90% tho -_-
---
Sorry but if you add this the same to mining, as jesus no more incentives to do mining in this game.
---
I was wondering when fractal would feed again, it feels like it's been almost a year
---
I'll pass the message.
---
I don't care where we're at tbh. I just wanna kill things.
---
Eve is easy to bot because the game provides all or most information needed in a way that is simple to process in an automated fashion (like the overview). Its also very predictable, so a bot doesn't require much actual decision making ability. A set of instructions in a loop can be enough in very simplistic cases.
---
How much of the hardcore playerbase taking over do you think is CCP pushing that kind of playstyle and how much is just EVE's reputation scaring away potential new casual players? I know it's anecdotal but whenever I try to get irl friends and people I play other games with to give it a shot I get a lot of "spreadsheets in space" and "don't want a second job." Not exactly helped by the fact that the only other person they know besides myself who plays *is* one of those hardcore spreadsheets-in-space players
---
Because like you pointed out PVE ships are bad in PVP.      
---
I know few exceptions but they relate to missions and waiting for someone in 2nd mission room knowing that someone will not land on you.
---
OMGimaDONKEY he had such char
---
Should be 'loyalty' on the Pic
---
to be clear :
---
 \- saying a state is encouraging is \*stating\* a relation between two events.
---
 \- saying some entity is encouraging is \*accusing\* this entity of actively taking actions to generate an event.
---
While I agree with the first, the second part needs a lot of proof and people agreeing with you for the first part may be mistaken as agreeing with you for the second part.
---
I assume that it was due to fact people didn't have pilots to fly those things.      
---
Injectors significantly changed way you get a super/titan.
---
It's not CQ that players were angry about, they were angry that there had basically been no updates for over 2 years. I think there is an appetite in the playerbase for a fully featured CQ environment, but it needs to come alongside the same amount of traditional eve content.
---
CCP don't want to be 'just EVE' and they are constantly trying to find a new viral cash cow, so this isn't actually going to happen.
---
Bar some actual integration with Project Nova with some universal WiS integration that would be pretty neat.
---
It is usually about some rogue director or person with to much shares.
---
Totally support this in full. I haven’t made the trip yet but if it’s as you described, I don’t want to waste my time.
---
Drugs?
---
LadyScarlet is fat tho.
---
C5 wolf rayet sites with Tim Nering
---
only 1.2% used it because it wasn't fully featured yet, you can't use it as a representation of the total amount of people interested in WiS.
---
Yes because all unbeatable entities in the past still exist.
---
sure but do you really think a small group should be able to beat what you just described? 
---
to me it seems unfair to change the game to cater to a small group who want to be able to take wins from arguably the most try hard and investment heavy group in the game
---
&gt;"fuck the income of everybody that does not want to mine for hours ... ideally with 10+ account multiboxes " 
---
aka. fuck the income of anyone refusing to recruit krabs to do the krabbing because killboards.
---
Please no
---
People love to say that "There's no way to design around N+1" but that's simply not true. There are tons of ways to design around N+1, and EVE basically doesn't do any of them.
---
&gt; Translation: Imperium won. 
---
They certainly won the mega-titan-blob game, and Goon leadership deserves credit for winning that game as well as they did.  The titans/day that Delve can produce is frightening.  
---
However, that game isn't the only one. To steal a phrase from BRAVE, what's the Fun/Hour of Goons? I'm sure the turbo-krab thing is fun for some folks, but it isn't for everyone. There's a multitude of playstyles out there, and loads of room for whatever you're into.
---
A few questions to add colour to the argument?
---
1. When you say "don't be cheap buy omega" are you buying a subscription for USD/GBP/etc or ingame in blocks of three months?
---
2. Because you have a three month window do you follow price and buy when cheap? or at the whim of the market when the three months is up?
---
You forgot the more hidden botting - exploration botting.  These bots are hard to locate because of their nomadic nature, but I see them all the time.    
---
There really needs to be some filters set to look into non-human playstyles.  I.E. 16+ hr active uptime for multiple days.
---
They are buddies with Init. They drop folks in Delve. 
---
Snuff is not a member of The Imperium. Official stance. Period.
---
F
---
I pay my blocks. Way intended so ccp can make a buck. I support the devs. I enjoy my game. I dont need to worry bout plex prices cause i already have my omega.
---
because they don't want to deal with a group of the most braindead turbokrabs? because they want to keep their identity in some way? because they just want to do their thing and not care about taking sov? becausr they straight up dislike big groups?
---
renting is cheap, it's not hard to understand really.
---
Is there anyone in goons with enough roles to flip enpogh keepstars/steel enough assets/disband besides Mittani though?
---
I think /u/stainguy would disagree
---
Yep. Not a great deal I can do to stop that.
---
Not that the votes actually \_mean\_ anything on this site. It's merely an expression of interest.
---
Damn, citadels are in WH. Do they show up in local?
---
lol nobody cares about nullsec
---
To answer the billboard question, I read they are reworking the advertisement system so we can have Corp ads etc again. I dont know a timeline, and I dont have knowledge why it changed in the first place though.
---
Didn't goons retreat all the way back to a single system back in the day only to be saved by a convenient server crash?  That seemed like a viable strategy - provided you can leverage some strategic server crashes.
---
Just do what other games do: Detect when someone has been Krabbing for 2+ hours straight, or a notable pattern detection. Then initialize this bot-stopper: A duplicate rat for the same site with the same stats, all it does is web to aggress, instead of shoot, and make it invincible. If player warps off, NPC warps off and site despawns at the regular rate. If player sits and tries to attack the NPC for more than a specified amount of time you can conclude that they are either unintelligent, or a bot.
---

all 52 of them

Yeah they do. They are basically stations. Very handy. Gone are the days of idling in space inside a pos shield.
---
Nice.
---
Good write up as per usual. 
---
My idea is to put all the reward into the LP system giving concord LP that being said I actually like your idea of OPEs being dropped. This would almost force ccp to give us a decent payout for lower level anoms which literally dont pay shit.  
---
The second issue here is this doesn't solve ratting as the biggest isk faucet in the game. Which im sure we can argue is just as big of an issue as bots killing the economy. We should be looking into ways to remove isk from ratting income. Do a moulde drop garentee a commander spawn do something besides put more isk into the game.. Thats my only issue with your solution. If were changing ratting we should change what the income is. We need to be watching how much isk is being sunk vs given. As this is the real problem with bots not so much they cant die or are always making income.
---
Anyone play crowfall?
---
The independent guy in the cloaked venture is the winner, because he refused to be enslaved by the various and sundry collectives. Here’s to you, freeman!
---
Except of mittens? No
---
Why not just have random captcha challenges
---
No. I like having the uniqueness of npc station less space.
---
I remember when "4 isk tritanium" was a sort of industrialist in-joke as a sign of the apocalypse, and nowwwwww....
---
then rental alliances could just split into n numbered iterations of itself for every range of sov "faloff" and completely ignore it. At the end of the day rental in sov null has existed almost since the start of the game and it has survived all iterations of it so far, it exists because people find it useful to their needs and that's it (and no, they're not all bots).
---
Now they have fun while also winning.
---
so breaking all other playing styles that were viable a long time in favour of one playing style is well balanced to you? Because that balance was my point, not sperging like the choleric you like Nelson from SouthPark doing a brainless HaaaHaaa.
---
Thinking about local and whitelists, it seems people either say to delete local like in WH's or adamently defend it.  Has anyone ever thought about a module that removes you individually from local?  Cloaking takes you off of d-scan but you can't interact without decloaking.  If a module removes you from local, maybe have you unable to warp to fleet members or have others warp to you or use probes making this solely a shotgun-tackler's module and not for the entire fleet.  Maybe toss in a locking-delay like with cloaks, module fitting limits, or maybe 0 resists like polarized weapons.   Make bots have to react to d-scans and overviews making reaction speed similar to actual players in the same situation
---
aint that the fucking truth
---
mittens (pbuh) has all rights to every single keep, fort, astrahus and whatever other sturtcure is there. noone else will ever get the keys so noone ever can go rogue and hurt the imperium
---
&gt; ELIMINATING RENTING
---
Renting is emergent. It'll always exist. And rental space isn't the only place where people rent.
---
Remove a significant percentage of bounty payouts from all NS anomalies, but add a guaranteed spawn at the end of each anomaly, which holds the equivalent ISK in Overseer Effects.
---
&gt; WHAT CAN CCP DO ABOUT IT?
---
New local delayed covert tackler ship class. 0 recalibration. But 0 damage. 
---
Either 60 seconds delayed, can probe and light a covert cyno or is fast/agile as a +1 scout, and 2.5 min delayed.
---
Introduce this ship, suddenly watch subcap anom bots becoming an asset to this game, as they are a source of content now.
---
&gt;"How big is your penis?" Hedliner asked.
---

---
You do realise it’s renting tho right ?

&gt;Stiletto warps in

"Which of these images contain Street Signs?"
---
Don't forget to reload! [your probes]
---
I think they have this AA-program (Activate Alcoholic) that takes care of your issue. I think it was a 40-day program with some lan partys and a Finfest. You should be fine after that.
---
I'm about a 1000 miles away from my computer for the next few days. Remote connections are my savior.
---
Except Serenity tells us a different story.
---
There have been huge groups before, NCPL domination was pretty huge at their peak, but never on the scale goons are now.
---
Things used to be like this on Serenity too, untill a group just got too big
---
I don't like the ESS idea after 5 minutes thinking about it.  It hurts genuine players as well as bots.  That's the problem isn't it.  Whatever you do you're making it a pain in the **** for legit people.
---
You answer your question in your question, is this some kind of trick?
---
ITT another Provibloc geopolitical expert confirming the significance of Provibloc and their sworn enemies, HTP and Spectre Fleet, who have single-handedly caused World War Bee and all subsequent conflicts in order to weaken Provibloc.
---
For sure man :)
---
null is mostly black actually
---
Oh, absolutely - I don’t have any idea on how impactful they are however so I decided to omit them. Thanks for bringing it up.
---
a lot of text here...maybe a good point or two. not sure. didn't read.
---
Some good battles were fought by TEST and CO2 in Tribute, but after it fell it was very clear there was no point trying to defend Vale.  TEST had no super fleet worth mentioning, and CO2's wasn't much better.  The power dynamic then was at least as bad as current NC/PL VS Goons, probably worse.
---
Great idea. 
---
Also completely impossible without a rewrite of anomaly mechanics.
---
They’re static chance based spawn lists that cannot change except downtime to downtime.
---
&gt; The Imperium has won Eve Online *again*
---
FTFY
---
We’ve been here before and we’ll be here again. Provided the game last long enough for pre-WWB conditions to arise again.
---
this is supposed to be a sandbox game, the base question should *never* be why it should be possible, but why it *shouldn't*. The reason it's possible is because two groups organically entered a contract with each other
---
eve has sound?
---
probably just drunk
---
&gt;Wormholes were ultimately dominated by the Imperium (Init)
---
That's news to me. I've been living out in wormholes for a while, running a small wormhole corp, and I've never seen hide nor hair of Init. Sorry, but your theory doesn't hold water when it comes to WH space.
---
To add to this, the only alliances in wormhole are either because the corp is part of a bigger entity outside wormholes, or it's a collection of holding corps used for various reasons (farmholes, separating industry from pvp, etc.)
---
K, so you ban renters today, let me shed some light on tomorrow:
---
Welcome to Cash Money Brothers alliance, theres monthly alliance dues to pay and we have assigned living, you'll get your address once you get to our staging.  All station services are at your disposal for a small fee, enjoy your stay.
---
Oh look, you're not really renting are you?
---
Whats worse is some of you have that literally right fucking now and DON'T consider yourselves renters.
---
honestly why do people still want a lowsec gate to stain once your in stain then what do you do. You are still basically in just a mega pipe region for eso or catch its just 25 straight from point at to point b. 
---
in reality i think stain needs to be shifted to the right (if looking at dotlan) so you can use it more effectively cause right now its jump range out or into stain is a joke
---
An update.
---
I actually have 5 seconds align time. The problem was when you got to EVE fitting windows and click 'stimulate' it TURNS ON every module - including after burner that I have. With afterburner I get 7+ seconds.
---
A couple of years ago: everyone shitting on Goons for not taking a losing fight and getting evicted.
---
Now: People calling NCPL smart for not taking a fight and evicting themselves.
---
I like the idea in concept - I think local long term does need a change, though I’m more in favour of you simply not showing in local at all during gate cloak to give you time to Dscan people down, as opposed to limiting offensive fleets to having one specific ship but hey ho.
---
My concern is that that idea would take months to test an implement, and I’m not sure CCP would see the benefit in it currently, hence proposing something CCP can easily achieve with sub 1 weeks work - We know they’re capable of this, as seen by the introduction of Titan/Super/Dread rats.
---
You miss the point. Imperium won in the short-term but they'll lose in the long-term because they can no longer provide content to their members in the form of large wars and so their PvP-focused members will leave for greener pastures.
---
no, it's per anomaly
---
What a pointless argument, if the sun didnt rise there would be no daylight!
---
Well, the sun does rise and the patch did happen.
---
\*Which
---
There are lots of different moon ores, some more valuable than others, with that being said the majority are better than anything you will find in an anomaly. You need an Athanor (I think, never actually done it myself) with a mining drill which needs to be fuelled for the period of time you have chosen. Longer the pull, bigger the moon belt. All moons are different.
---
There is a lore entry about a crewmember sabotaging a ship's guns while the ship is running a site, which causes the ship to stop DPS tanking and asplode.
---
The capsuleer is very upset about this.
---
&gt;I'm sure the turbo-krab thing is fun for some folks, but it isn't for everyone.
---
Speaking from experience, it's only fun for a short time, a few months to a couple years or so, and then you just quit the game because you don't know how to get into PvP.
---
what if a cloak removed you from local
---
:thinking:
---
&gt;Villlllllll**l**y
---
&gt; This is bottable.
---
If a player can interact with it in the game, its bottable. 
---
&gt;You don't want less and less (particularly real) people farming in null. That's what happens with bounty nerfs, with yield nerfs, etc etc. You want people to farm, and lose a more significant portion of that farm as killmails.
---
Enough losses will cause people to give up just as reducing their yield would, because losses cut into yield.
---
“If this final "mini boss" will be just normal rat with additional can it will change nothing ... but what if the final boss will try to escape and you need to point it and even web it if you are slow.”

Flipping it around - What if it webbed and pointed the ratter? : )
---
Amazing, this is what the Imperium said and did during the Casino War and were skewered for it by the very people now packing up.
---
&gt;And get given space to quietly krab down there

You mean to bot.
---
I shall always love you Naz. 
---
It's your pilots that are going to stop logging in, my dude.
---
yepp, you're right. Obviously the Gallente propaganda needs to go back to school
---
It was not after the gigx ban, gigx got banned because of his reaction to The Judge flipping.
---
Had a guy in lowsec in a procurer, talked in local which ice he should mine since he was mining the high sec variant. No reply. Thought a good lesson was in order for afk mining. Killed him. All I got for salt was a 1million bounty. I never seem to get salt unless I'm killing someone during a group roam.
---
The guy from the OP seems to have one of the worst meltdowns in eve salt history
---
&gt; Replace structure damage caps with logarithmic damage scaling
---
Just taking ownership of this one. I'm not worried about the details right now and you'd need to tweak a lot of numbers, but the fact you can't speed up an uncontested grind is absolutely ridiculous.
---
Ok, not completely 1 time. It is 1 payment up front, then the corp is assessed taxes just like GSF membercorps are.
---
Farms and Fields was the keywords shouted by everyone for years. Now we have it.
---
Sounds pretty balanced when comparing the effort of holding a moon and holding a moon while mining it manually.
---
Basically this. if Legacy came in on the side of Panfam you might get a big super battle, but currently it just isn't gonna happen.
---
Which is why it's perfect legit to play a Gallente pilot, flying a Minmatar ship, with Caldari Navy fittings, fighting for the Amarr militia.
---
If the lore is just background noise, then why bother with it at all? Why come up with FW? Why have Standings for different factions and corps? All those things were supposed to mean something.
---
&gt; The headlines from Eve literally consist of crazy shit we the players did
---
Like how the Shattered Wormholes were brought into existence? A bunch of drama happened during downtime. And we logged back in to hear about how exciting it was, and how there was suddenly new stuff now. =)
---
This guy understands morale.
---
But if you only do it because you are paid just makes you a whore.
---
So it is totally ok, to make it from balanced to eliminating one playstyle nearly complete? Do you think that has something to do with the decline of "butt-in-chair" players sine 2013/14 by 50%.
---
(logged in accounts down by 30-40%, while accounts per player has dramatically skyrocketed with the inject-to-10-Rorquals-Meta?)
---
Fitting confessor to farm in c3 wolf-rayet. Should I use 1mn ab or 10mn? 10mn is slightly lower on dps, because I have to change dps rigs for engineering ones to fit 10mn.
---
Also whqt is the optimal range to tank these sleepers? I could try this experimentally, ofc, but I'm a bit scared of being one-shotted of sleepers suddenly track
---
You don't need PVP focused players if you can field 1k titans.

&gt;New Eden Independent Reporters
---
Is that what butthurt providence linemembers who make fresh reddit accounts to complain are calling themselves lately?
---
The only "concerns" you should be having should be with regard to your incompetent leadership, generally useless members, and how long it will take for Legacy to get fed up with your continued existence.
---
900 Titans...800 Titans...700 Titans...
---
the rigs are still there though
---
you mean like last time goons packed up and left?
---
ive filed a bug report and a petition and this, is by all indicators, intentional
---
 a 0.1% chance of just dying because the game decided that today you're going to spawn in the middle of them, and there's nothing you can really do about it.
---
not true, there are multiple fits that can survive this room
---
You see similar issues in Rust where large clans turtle up much the same way nullblocs do. It's just common player behavior in higher risk games.

&gt;several alliances planned to attend and have a big fight

EVE 2019: players judge accessibility of regions by jump range
---
&gt; Enough losses will cause people to give up just as reducing their yield would, because losses cut into yield.
---
Yes. But this is simply a taxation problem. If you tax 90% of people's income in a country, then the economic activity will cease. But if you tax 5%, then it will be too low to keep the system alive.
---
Did you know [the percentage of mining gains](http://prntscr.com/npedou) that convert to killmails across all New Eden? In March it was 4.4%. 2 years ago it was about 6.5%. To fix things, CCP should aim for 15% average in nullsec. Until then changes should be made to make nullsec less safe.
---
Yes, I know.  That's kind-of my point.  Thanks for the downvotes.
---
What about if instead of an ESS the functionality was added to the TCU?
---
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bmjkj5/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_may_09/) is last week’s thread
---
You should clarify tackle rorq lol
---
Thank you. It all helps understand what people do. My fear is that the PLEX price is just traders selling to traders selling to traders selling to traders... Turtles all the way down.
---
Until one of said traders leaves the game :)
---
If you think it's cool for an entity to win a PVP game primarily through PVE, then I'd happily be degenerate and cancerous.
---
I don't disagree with the assessment, only the way you want to go about it.
---
This just makes ratting more tedious. Anything repetitive and tedious just attracts more bots.
---
Like, if this were the case, after the first few sites I'd probably want a bot that goes around my empty sites scooping my loot for me.
---
This is reported in an amusing way.
---
It sounds like Test forced a ransom and got paid. Treachery? Panfam and Legacy alliance? Some real tinfoil hat stuff :)
---
The issue with replacing ISK with Concord LP is that not only are you removing over 50% of ISK coming into the game, you're also increasing the ISK leaving the game in the form of the ISK you pay alongside paying with Concord LP. While this may seem like a good idea in the short term, over the long term it doesn't really seem viable.
---
1 mn, and watch your transversal.
---
I’ve been on shot while doing a FFS in. c13 due to a bad transversal :)
---
&gt; I think local long term does need a change
---
I surprisingly agree as a nullsec hunter. That's why I propose a less invasive change than people calling a "removal" or a system which ties local to infrastructure. Just local delayed 1 ship class.
---
&gt; My concern is that that idea would take months to test an implement, and I’m not sure CCP would see the benefit in it currently,
---
This is very true as I imagine a change like this requires significant changes in the stuff going on in the background.
---
But hey, for once we would get a really effective solution instead of a half-assed one due to not enough manpower.
---
Downtime is noon for me.
---
I sit at the lunch table, fork in one hand, chrome remote desktop android app in the other.

---
IMO, it's 80% CCP's fault right now, though it may be unintentional. Every expansion over the last three years has been focused on these play styles with almost nothing left over for other play styles.
---
The only thing that CCP can point to over the last three years that isn't aimed at those two play styles is Abyssal Deadspace, and I'd bet a significant sum of money that the percentage of the player base participating in that is pretty low.
---
We have noticed that.
---
I mean if you use a Battleship instead of a VNI you'll be able to sit where they spawn and not worry about that, but then you'd have to risk a ship, which is spooky. 
---
Do you have any alternate suggestions on how to make ratting less bottable, as opposed to less tedious? Alternate suggestions are always good.
---
There's a mixture of "No they shouldn't, obviously" but also "You hold ~150 systems and you sure as fuck aren't using them all yourselves. Small entities that come at you for even a tiny edge get cut down instantly."
---
Earning a region, maybe even two, for your home since you are doing well makes sense and I'm not really contesting that, but seven?
---
Like, maybe groups don't need *that* much space? Goons manages to compact 40k toons into a region and a half, and it's the rest of Imperium that expands way the fuck out. Blocs are taking way more space than they could ever hope to use just because there's no one single entity to contest them for it.
---
Itsfreerealestate.png is very poor for the game's health. Does it advance your alliance? I mean obviously yeah. Does it keep the game healthy? No, and since players don't seem to want to be willing to police themselves - and why should they, they say - then maybe we need to take the decision out of their hands.
---
The highest priority in game design has to make the game fun for the players, not to make it more difficult to bot! Bots have to be dealt with through bans. The bans have to faster and on a bigger scale. I'm not confident that CCP uses automated tools to the extend they should. They mostly communicate "report and we ban". They need to be proactively monitoring player activity. Player who are 23/7 active can't be players, many other simple flags exist, too. Characters which turn up on those flags need to be banned after only 1-2 days.
---
Please stop to suggest things that make the game terrible for real players because this would maybe reduce botting.
---
I've already bought Below Zero. It's early in its storyline development but right now it's looking *very* good. It cleverly takes that Subnautica gives it and builds on it in a creative way. In particular, I love how it sets up its initial narrative. It's clever as hell.
---
I'm very much looking forward to the full game!
---
Few things:  
---
1- do you know a different mechanic that spawns spaceships in game aside from using the industry UI?  
---
2-what would one conceivably use spaceships in space for? 
---
3-when did TAPI join the imperium?  My overview still shows them all as neutral?  
---
4-is there something inherently flawed with the systems you populate that doesn’t then yield nearly identical resources so as to allow your industry UI to go from red to green on the start job box?
---
Is the problem more with you, your failed alliance and lack of leadership rather than goons (or anyone else for that matter) ability to use what’s available in terms of space, resources and talented leaders and motivated line members?
---
I won’t wait for your downvote brigade of the truth here we all know who this shit show belongs to. 
---
(Extra credit question:  why wasn’t INITs wormhole Corp not tickered WINIT??)).
---
He's right though, it's an awful region. [Just look at it it](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Stain#const). There's no loops, it doesn't connect anything it's just a fractal of dead end pockets that connect to the deadest region in the game (Period Basis), with a 20 jump pipe between another pretty annoyingly laid out region (Catch) and the least desirable part of Esoteria.
---
LOL, the effort of holding an R64 in Aridia as &lt;100 member corp was literally hundreds of % higher than holding an Athanor nobody wants to shoot in an Umbrella Area. But that effort (fighting to get and hold the moon) was our playstyle. Something you would not understand. Go back to your Mining ... i think I heard NEAR2 ping in your background, you have to scoop manually as TACO is not running today -.- .... sad you actually have to tab in now for your "active" resource gathering. 
---
Back in old "passive" days I could not do this when manually taking dozens of actually risky jumps in Lowsec with a DST to empty &amp; refill Towers
---
Don't drag me into this
---
This sounds pretty easy to catch out from the bot's perspective. Just lock everything you target and if you don't see the bars go red just gtfo
---
It's not that Goons won through PvE. It's that you lost due being dumb.
---
Ask Simple Farmers how they manage to hold a major choke point and still own infrastructure in the constellation
---
You can't.
---
All bots do are the same things people do. If a person can do it, a bot is going to be able to do it.
---
Ultimately I think panfams only hope is that a few of the imperiums FC wives figure out where the lingerie store is.  I don’t see much else getting in the way and even that might not overcome the bloodlust for finishing the casino war retribution.  
---
RIP panfam.  F.
---
"The Imperium has won their game":  ftfy.
---
The thing is, we don't all play their game.
---
Hey my alliance got a shout out. Cool!
---
None of those things benefit from having sov though, so why bother renting at that point.
---
Doing well in tournaments (rip alliance tournament) and pvp in general is being dumb? I guess so in Eve.
---
Where do you think your ships come from? Server magic?
---
Stop giving them content. Don't play this shit game.
---
Imagine getting this upset.
---
I wonder how many people will get that reference :)
---
lol okay
---
How about getting rid of this feudal renting system and stop claiming space you're not using so that new entities can pop up?
---
I flew from jita to northern Malpais yesterday and there's none there. 2/3rd of the null-sec systems I flew through had at most 1 other person in the system.
---
You  do not realize that the playstyle you crave so much is the shovel to burying this game ... but I did not expect anything else, you even harbor the guys that destroyed serenity now ...
---
There are tons of smaller entities in Goons that are doing small gang, wormhole stuff, and Sigs that do local small scale war.
---
People want to have a game for free. Ccp needs to make money. They rnt gonna just lower orices cause someone needs to plex 40 accounts for free. No. Those 40 accounts to them is a loss. Cause ur mot paying CCP their running costs. 
---
Games now make money off subscriptions. Or micro transactions. U need one or the other. And if im buying plex. Of course i want top dollar. Im oayig for YOUR subscription. (Not u specifically). So yes im gonna continue to feed market as plex goes up. Or people starting paying for their sub so ccp can make their income.
---
Was it wolf-rayet or an ordinary c13? W-R also reduces your signature and boosts your armor
---
C13 has a C6 WR effects :)
---
Well honestly we need something drastic in the short term.. We cant have more isk coming in than leaving at least at the scale we do. It causes the spectacular inflation that weve been seeing over the last few years.
---
When I started plex was 600m.. Its quadruple that in a few years. We can argue as to why but im 90% sure its mainly due to inflation not overpopulation which is what most players would have you believe. I doubt any amount players could effect it on that scale.
---
I say inflation cuz everything else is going up also with the exception of t1 stuff cuz rorquals.. 
---
But to more directly respond to your point. I se the long haul it being a bit of an issue but then we just rebalance it so its something like 50/50 lp to isk. Or do the overseer stuff OP mentioned. That works to. But we need to reduce the incoming ise at some level and nerfing reswpawn timers isnt the fucking answer ccp.
---
Yes tons of typos. Idc. Im working and typing.
---
Increase the Watchlist size.
---
Join me in this fight, logifrans!
---
Ok, I'm new to wormholes) what was your dps and on what distance with such buff?
---
In what way is this any different from just slapping a mining laser on your ship?
---
Looks great!
---
So as you do more damage, less damage (as a percentage of incoming) is done?
---
I did my fair share of multibox mining. But I always prioritized PvP.
---
I'm really torn because on one side - this is going to encourage people to hunt bots (great!) on the other side - the maker of these bots will simply add in randomness on how long it takes to warp back to the site, or at what distance they warp in and the gig will be up with some randomness introduced into the mix. (Bad!) 
---
Its like - knowledge works both ways, but unfortonately in this scenario I think its likely to improve the bot in the long run (For the record, I didn't downvote the thread)
---
Here's to hoping NCPL gets to work like goons did after the game died in WWB.
---
I am not arguing with him, I just find it funny.
---
Dps was at around 1.1k dps
---
And range wise, I was trying to be as close as possible to ortbit sleepers.
---
But I was mostly using aurora for long range, standard for mid range and glean for short range,
---
So far the price I pay for my omega status is the same $15/month as it always was.  And when my wife lights a cyno in the bedroom on day 29 I don’t have a hard choice to make ;-D
---
one of the main differences is the coalition that evicted goons was temporary for the stated fact that they still wanted to shoot each other after it was over.
---
and they did break up to shoot each other.
---
Wouldn’t it be funny if mittens himself kicked down his sand castle?
---
Ok, do sleepers have any kind of optimal range or faloff? Or they juwt do flat dps in 250km?
---
One of the saddest events in eve as long as I've been playing tbh... we could have had so much more fun in that war had the judge not been a little shit.
---
Didn't you read his factual and well thought out post though? Init won wormholes.
---
That's... great? Good for you. What does that have to do with anything?
---
He wants to make mining passive income.  Like fill up a deployable, go do a PvP fleet and come back to 1,000,000m3 of compressed spod.  
---
Shit post.  Toss it.
---
Yes it would be and I am Imperium citizen and still would find it hilarious even if id lose all
---
Who said eve is just a PVP game? Your way of playing is not the only way to play.
---
They should make it so you can activate the eve gate.  When you do it deletes your character and that’s it, you win.
---
Vililirier
---
I like idea with overseer effect but instead of selling on market you need to exchange it in certain station for isk. And those stations are located in LS/HS

I like the ope drop idea. Maybe add a bit more of an incentive by having it be an commander spawn with a really low chance to drop faction loot. Also it should try to warp off and it will point you.
---
Another idea would be to change anom names to be generic so you don't know what kind of site you are entering before you get there. The bots would have to be programmed for any type of anoms that exist. Make sure that at least one type will point you on landing :)
---
why do those things need to benefit from having sov in the first place? those are some of the reasons people rent *instead* of joining a nullbloc to use sov null space, not the reason why they would go to sov null in the first place.
---
Amarr Victor.
---
Because all other races are godless heathens.
---
Exhibit one, Point # 3 Gentlemen\^ and this is why Tranquility was lost.
---
i suppose you are trading "active" mining gameplay for not being able to warp out all assets when baddies show up.
---
There are only two sides in the game with that kind of thinking.
---
Maybe dont undock a cap when you're fighting lokis.
---
You belong in kspace clearly
---
While TAPI sits and does nothing
---
 agree, best time ever
---
Goons didnt adapt to the meta, the meta adapted to them.
---
Only because they haven't bothered to come blob you yet.
---
Or just change Cache entirely to lowsec status? No one has used that region seriously since Red Alliance back in God knows when
---
Its about resource management as much as its about pvp. Always has been.
---
Apparently you can be even more upset than earlier
---
Zkill gives an overview on its main page of the top alliances in amount of kills. Is there anywhere an overview to find of how much destruction in isk each alliance achieved and how much they lost?
---
I know I'm going to get downvoted for this - So be it, it's my opinion.
---
Panfam is almost entirely to blame for the current situation. Allow me to explain:
---
Shortly after WWB, Goons were pulling back whatever they had left, and moving it all south. TEST was a bit smaller back then but still wanted wanted to pursue and make sure Goons didn't get the chance to regroup and rebuild - no one else in the MBC was with us, and instead decided to take a break instead. Not too long after, Panfam decided they were bored, wanted content, and decided to pick the closest non-Panfam entity to bully around. That happened to be CO2 and TEST - former MBC members. All the while, the bees got busy rebuilding, just like we knew they would, completely undisturbed. CO2 and TEST lost their homes, decided to move South, and the rest is history.
---
Had Panfam and the rest of MBC listened to us, the sov map would have looked very different than it does today.
---
they can with AI. Make AI led fleets that attack sov. It will force smaller, consolidated space and open nullsec to many groups. Basically, Nullsec needs to Balkanize. More groups equal more drama equal more likely a Franz Ferdinand event happens more often than not.
---
If all it takes to win eve is to destroy a numerically smaller groups structures in tribute, I think Ive won eve 4 times :thinking:
---
This is a shit teir idea, people would spam them fucking everywhere
---
If that happens we'll just settle in another wormhole.         
---
I don't know where you get this idea that J-Space is anything like the krabbing and botting of null.
---
What system do WHs use?  IIRC there are spawns that are different if a capital is on grid so that is at least somewhat dynamic.
---
The concept of resource depletion is interesting and kind-of similar to the one where resources wax and wane around the galaxy, a bit like PI does on a planet.
---
I don't think this idea is terrible.  But it does need some work.
---
r/woooosh
---
[He wants to make mining passive income](https://www.eveonline.com/article/eve-online-exodus-1).
---
Not of the Anom, write a new script, or conditional script chain, that runs specific to a player's session. The detectors can read the anom's NPC pool, and have a random NPC warp in to the player. I know I have no insight on what CCP's code looks like, but I also understand that standalone scripts are plausible and possible. As well, input timings can be monitored for systems with less than 'n' number of players, say 20. Botters like pockets, so start monitoring exactly(ish) timed input; that'll catch macro cheats too (against EULA). Your client already monitors your input, so why not utilize that. Daybreak games detects aimbotters using similar tactics and RAM injection detection, but they ban not only your IP, but your Windows ID (reinstall or RegEdit skill req'd to fix).  
---
I'm sure my ideas are already thought of, I just like spewing shit to be social sometimes. kek
---
Yeah. Damage cap right now on an Astrahus is 6250 dps with 24 minutes for each timer (up to 56 minutes on armor timer for a faction fortizar). A typical fleet fleet ship does 400-600 dps with its closest range ammo, maybe a bit higher with certain battleships so your first 15 subcap DPS ships are getting the job done. If you formed up 500 people and the other side stood down for whatever reason, 485 of those people aren't achieving anything and there's no way to make it to go faster.
---
Say your 6,250 dps takes 30 minutes, but if you brought 80,000 dps it took 15 minutes (that's 7 or 8 dreads or a fully maxed out 250 man fleet), then if you brought 500,000 dps (that's 50 titans or ~50-70 dreads) it took 5 minutes. Just some non-linear scaling mechanic for the time it takes.
---
Offensively this gives you real cost/benefit, a reason to commit (and thus more opportunities for counter drops), and a way to make the grind far less painful once the war is completely over and its just a clean up job.
---
You can use the greater than (&gt;) to quote FYI
---
Like so:
---
&gt;Flipping it around - What if it webbed and pointed the ratter? : )
---
It's just an excuse for adding new stations and stuff. Botting is part of the game atm, if CCP really wanted to stop botting, they could.
---
That's the way to do it
---
As someone who left Provibloc and joined Goons because I was fed up with losing, I can tell you it's definitely more fun.  The idea that we're too dominant does cause some anxiety though.
---
&gt;the maker of these bots will simply add in randomness 
---
They can already change the timer, just check your evemail for the bot advertisement then watch the youtube video on how it works.
---
Sounds like a big improvement from the current structures.
---
In order for a bot to detect it, the bot author would have to write an entirely new detection method to counter the new NPC. So long as the NPC is non-unique and spawns with a wave, it would be hard to tell other than detection of being webbed/etc. A few Anoms already have random spawn counts, so how would a bot detect specific NPCs without any sort of unique difference. A ttk timer would be effective but would force the bot to warp off if it randomly targets the bot-catcher NPC first of the wave, and can't kill it.
---
I think with the overwhemling superiority of Moonmining compared to Belt Mining, such a structure could work (only in belts tho!) to make Belt Mining a bit more attractive again. 
---
Belt mining is pretty horrible, having to fly around and constantly deplete rocks. 
---
Make this Module less efficient than normal barges (per person) but with enough range to reach everything in a normal Belt. Additionally limit it to 1 Structure per belt.
---
A normal Mining Op would then look like -&gt; Setup structure. Power it with some alts available -&gt; Send Mining Barges to deplete the biggest chunks, let the structure clean up the rest. Noone wants to clean up the small shitty left-overs.
---
I want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. You're saying that (let's say 50/50) 50% of the isk you receive from an anom is received in ticks at is currently. The other 50% drops at the despawn of the anom essentially in a lump sum that has to be scooped?
---
If that's correct, I don't see why a bot would ever leave the loot sitting around after 6 hours. I'd think the bot would be much more efficient and patient about grabbing the loot and dropping it off at a structure more than a regular player would. And the hunter would...what, have to finish the site to get the drop if they scare off the bot?
---
I really liked the old ones more then the current ones, especially the yellow cloud we used to have in couster and amarr was nice, btw ship icons still have these old backgrounds.
---
Then panfam attacked legacy and got you to blue imperium, war ensued. Finally ending in the north with a ceasefire and a deal. Then panhorde backstabs another potential ally in the north.
---
Aaaaaand, now they unanchor keepstars because they dont have enough friends....
---
Totally agree with you
---
Those are 'escalations' - The Anom can tell if a specific ship has entered, as that's how spawn timers start. However it is not wired up to check for individual pilots, from what I understand. You could make it so that if a Cruiser warped in more webbing/pointing rats would spawn, or more BS if a BS warped in, but spawning roaming Bot execution squads if X limit is reached doesn't work.
---
&gt;ability to use what’s available in terms of space, resources and talented leaders and motivated line members?
---
You mention other alliances not using everything that's available and that's fair, but Goons aren't using everything that's available, either. They aren't winning through a combination of PvE and PvP. They're winning through PvE.
---
No, those are skins that haven't been released yet, but are coded into tranquility.
---
the unique difference is that it doesn't take damage. As I said, lock the special npc, apply dps, look at the damage bars on the 'locked on' icon (or whatever that's called) and if they stay all solid white for a solid 30s or so, warp off.
---
That's exactly what I didnt suggest. I wish I never used mining as an example cause its been straw manned now. I suggest deployable structures powered by player cap transfers.
---
What fucking part of that is passive?
---
To finish this conversation on your level, I leave you this here https://www.pixilart.com/images/art/82265d693708297.png
---
Agreed. And I feel like a large chunk of the playerbase actively pushes for this to be the case. A lot of people want to be able to AFK rat or mine. Meaning minimum user interaction for very long periods of time. As long as that's a design goal, bots are going to be prevalent.
---
This is a good initiative, been thinking about doing this a while. 
---
Suggestion:  Mark things with more than one idea for a split or resub.
---
It should be a single idea per entry. 
---
Example:  I like the idea of asset safety paid out as a bounty, but do not agree with supers and Titans just dropping out of the structure
---
Lots of smug here. 
---
If goons n pets could take malpais, they would have. Please do so, it gives our deployment a reason other than scaring you away. Don't have your invasion be nothing but smoke, it's just not good for morale.
---
How are people getting them then?
---
I see them listed on sell and contracts in Jita
---
You can search for a given individual/corp/alliance on zKill, and there's a Stats tab on their respective pages (i.e. here's the one for [Goons](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/1354830081/stats/)).
---
&gt;If that's correct, I don't see why a bot would ever leave the loot sitting around after 6 hours.
---
It would have it in it's cargo, as the ISK doesn't go directly into the characters wallet, as some % of it is in a physical item. Assuming 50m/h that means the VNI has 150m of loot inside it for you to take if it's been ratting for 6 hours. If the VNI drops off it's loot after every site that's both much slower, and also much easier for CCP to notice. 
---
&gt;And the hunter would...what, have to finish the site to get the drop if they scare off the bot?
---
As someone who's hunted bots before, you end up landing in a LOT of nearly finished sites - Being able to get something out of that would personally incentivise me to disrupt them further, although as I note in the article it's not something that will appeal to veteran players - It's the kind of thing someone can justify doing.
---
&gt; Villllllllll**l**y
---
CCP tweaked the game toward masses of new players, now masses are "winning".
---
I don't necessarily think it has to be, you could make is a low % chance and most regular players would only come across it once and a while but a long duration player would almost be guaranteed to see it once during their session.
---
I also don't think it has to be a bot execution thing just something unexpected that a player could likely figure out but a bot wouldn't be able to (i.e. it would have to have the same name/type as other common rats so it couldn't be OCR'd).  Maybe it's a rat that specifically only shoots drones/fighters and has long range webs?
---
who the fuck is imperium? Its goons.
---
Yup - The less decisions you have to make with imperfect information, the easier it is for bots to excel. That's basically a distillation of my problem with PvE and why I think it needs to be addressed in the short term. 
---
Long term I imagine a procedurally generated Anom system (ala what they made for Resource Wars) would be much better at making the content both engaging for players, and difficult for bots.
---
Astero bots are really cancer. They were so prevalent while I was in the north that it was incredibly hard to get any relic sites in blue space.
---
They instawarp and so must be caught with an interdictor, and the botters also will add the killers to a blacklist so you can't kill them twice easily (they'll cloak and warp off if a blacklist enters local). This can be abused theoretically by saturating the list--killing them over with many characters who live in different systems--but the effort to catch them is pretty significant because of the instawarp+covops.
---
Moreover they weaken regional security, as you can sneak in an astero easily if a region is infested with asterobots.

---
I love the idea in concept, but I think you have to be careful with it.  Right now bots (at least the ones I've anecdotally responded to reports about) are almost entirely ratters rather than miners.  I'm sure mining bots exist, but it's easier to shoot something and get isk than it is to mine ore, and then do something with the ore to get isk, so it stands to reason why most botters would prefer ratting.  If you make ratting enough of a pain in the ass, not only will bots not do it, but players might not either.  The prospect of slowboating a supercarrier to the center of a rock haven to scoop loot would probably encourage most of them to take up rorq mining instead.  I suspect you'll just move most bots over to barge mining rather than ratting, and make them that much harder to detect and do something about.  This change would probably not do anything to curb the number of bots per capita in the game, but would almost certainly inflate the value of isk while deflating the value of minerals.
---
Good idea.
---
Both botting and shitty suggestions about how to stop botting need to be stopped
---
hell yeah!
---
Best idea ever.
---
I didn't say "take no damage", I said make it invincible. Elaborated: set health to normal amount, just won't fall below 1 structure HP, damage will still tick. Shit the possible creations are nearly in the hundreds. Here's another: set repair rate at 20000000/s and health set to 20000000, if you want to dedicate the fleet to kill it, give em a drop. I was making vague points and wasn't intending to elaborate every point that could be self-explanatory.
---
Here comes the first invasion.
---
Whew, this thread is filled with a bunch of defeatist sissies. Let's put this into perspective: 
---
3 years ago All of Eve (TM) united against Goons (who were also considered impossibly strong then, too). Their friends defected, they lost their lands, and every other thread and comment on reddit was about how much they sucked. They were properly fucked, and by all rights they should have failscaded into history. 
---
Instead they did what shouldn't have been possible. They exploited their opponents mistakes to consolidate in one region and doubled down. They rebuilt bigger and stronger than ever. Now they're the dominant super power again.
---
The history of Eve is filled with the rise and fall of empires, and with dedicated groups working hard to accomplish the impossible. Put simply, the game isn't fucked. You're just being lazy and stupid. Either man up or shut the fuck up.
---
Nobody has cared about cal/gal warzone since galmil batphoned snuff enough times that 90% of calmil got bored and left. Fuck even seems like half of galmil got bored and left.
---
I almost like this idea, kind of like a pirate tag per site that becomes the bounties, but I think you would need to add a station manager or station agent to each upwell structure, like a Concord or upwell liaison, that you can trade these tags into or something. If you had to ship tags in from 3 regions away to high sec that I think would just stop ratting activity completely.
---
The benefit of such a system is that you could use a scaling system to make certain tags worth more or less based on the number of tags of other types turned in.  For instance, too many guristas tags turned in, so this week Sansha or Serpentis are more valuable. You could literally fight for control of profitable setting space by embargoes for certain faction npc areas.  Hilarious.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Convert anoms to "shallow abyassal space" so same star system but need a "filament MWD" to reach
---
THIS. I wish there was more high-risk high-reward ops for a solo player like that.
---
Some sites already have varied positions.  It is Havens that are guaranteed to spawn on the stargate, which makes them superior.  VNI's only have to worry about the dread spawn since the enemies won't spawn in web range.  Supers can bomb, smart bombers can vaporize them.    
---
There have been a lot of good ideas floating around.  Sites could spawn more tackle or faster tackle.  There could be a chance for a bonus wave to 'warp in' instead of spawning.  There could be a chance for nearby diamond rats to respond.  They could hotdrop the dread instead of just spawning it in the middle.  They could randomize waves, or even better, an individual system could slowly react to whatever is most commonly running them and force the players to occasionally change ships / tactics.  Maybe a hictor is in the spawn and it takes remote reps from the rats so you have to kill it last.    
---
I really can't imagine that many of these tweaks would be that challenging from a code perspective either, but take that with a grain of doubt.  I've never seen Eve's code and if any of the rumors are true, I might hurl if I did.
---
Those don’t matter when they stop logging in or defect. Or even if the Imperium can’t kill any cyno jammers.
---
Much prefer this option over NPC randomly splatted all over the place.
---
I think you're thinking of Red Alliance, which got beaten back to a single system way back in the early days of EVE, and then managed to defend it and come back.  You might have confused it since early Goonswarm was closely allied to Red Alliance, but the Red Alliance defense of C-J was before they allied with Goonswarm and was done all on their own.  We didn't play any role.  I don't think a server crash had anything to do with it though.
---
If someone’s plex 40 accounts “for free”, CCP still wins, someone has to have bought that plex at before...
---
&gt; If Test changed sides then maybe a coalition of "all of eve" would have a chance, but that wont happen for two main reasons.
---
The people on the 'other side' have done way more to fuck us in the last few years than Goons have.  Scarcely anyone in TEST would tolerate helping them.
---
It's almost like everyone went into mbc knowing it was temporary because a massive blue donut would be a content killer. Don't pretend that test was forced to blue the Imperium. They chose of their own free will.
---
Hm over a decade of never adding randomization to any kind of pve has taught me that CCP and the players dont want RNG to potentially kill them.
---
I already saw one post today about how a randomized spawn in an abyssal site killed someone and they were mad about it.
---
Eve players like 'solved' PVE.
---
Jester is being a good person and still answering stuff in the thread. The sticky doesn't mean this is a normal 'live' AMA, aka don't expect him to answer everything. But since he's still answering questions I'll keep it stickied for a bit.
---
In other words, they captured current sov warfare perfectly. ;-)
---
The first idea is pretty punishing for regular players tho, since they would have to grind this rat down just to realise it's a 'bot killer'. 
---
Also giving them rewards is a horrible idea, as you say they spawn when botting activity is suspected so you're practically encouraging botting activity so people can farm whatever this reward is (presuming it is significant compared to the effort required to kill it)
---
All of this could still be circumvented with a simple timer on the whole anom, if X anom takes more than (however long an anom normally takes + 50% or something) then just warp off and ignore it. The thing is that since rewards are not awarded on completion but continuously as you kill ships that this in the end is not a significant punishment for bots.
---
Thats where ur orices r sky rocketing...people arent buying plex like that. Now people r trading bavk and forth. Less and less plex buyers.
---
But you wouldn't because of asset safety and that's another problem
---
Yeh, it is more some kind of a draft to show the purpose. I guess you can improve this in a lot of ways through several things.
---
Thanks for sharing, but thats not a ranking showing amount of isk destroyed/lost per alliance
---
Asking CCP for adjusted prices or to have a sale on plex. Ur aaking them to cut their margins for ur own personal gains. Accept the rising prices. Or sub. Easy choices.
---
Helicoptering supers and titans for half a decade and blobbing people until people gathered enough to resist the blob is not being good in pvp. It is riding the wave and deciding to get off before the end of the ride.
---
Try undocking instead of shit posting.

---
Good old devswarm. Never lets you down.
---
&gt; dominated by TAPI (which is pretty much Imperium).
---
It's been years since Fountain but my inner GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR is burning in me right now
---
But what if we like bots and renter alliances just for the fact it'll kill off content faster therefore killing EvE itself...
---
yeah the removal of drone alloys was necessary for it to make sense to build supers anywhere else with locally sourced materials instead of just buying alloys in jita.
---
however goonswarm has been working since, basically, 2010 on growing our in-house supers as hard as we could.  it just was very hard to maintain them until we could reach a point where we had enough supers to use them without immediately getting shitstomped and reset to zero.  that basically culminated in BR- which was the first time that PL/NC lost supercap superiority.  from there, we could use supers up until restofeve.rmt allied against us, and that re-established a supercap umbrella we couldn't use supercaps under.  but when we moved to delve, we already had enough supercaps to utterly crush the defenders by dropping scads of supercaps on them - so long as restofeve.rmt didn't follow us. 
---
from there, well, you know the rest.  it's not that we just decided to build up supercaps in 2016.  we've been doing it for a very long time - it's just that it was mostly behind the scenes for a long time because if you don't have the most supercaps in-theater you don't have any supercaps.
---
This shit again?
---
Did htp blue legacy?
---
I would if a casino paid me to, yea.
---
Not relevant, as long as Goons and legacy are allies #allofeve is outnumbered both in sub caps and titans
---
Easy talk coming from an ally of goons.
---
So an honest question from a new guy in the last 6 months or so - really trying to understand the history and how we got to where we are today so that we can maybe foresee the future(if that’s even remotely possible).  Here goes.  
---
Why does everyone shit on TAPI for “bluing all of Eve” and being a member of the imperium?   TAPI/legacy seem to have neutral standings with goons/imperium and red to panfam.  
---
If you take the populations of pilots into account and leave aside the numbers of alliances, aren’t all the big null blocs about the same numbers?  Legacy incl test ~36-38k.  Imperium ~45-48k.  Panfam ~25-30k.   Fraternity/winterco ~15-18k.  I’m probably missing renters but I don’t know that they count in any official capacity.  
---
And then why does TAPI get shit on being labeled a “pet” of goons?  I’d think if that’s true then all of eve are pets of goons?   
---
Thanks
---
Is it me or all these botting solutions post are written by people who would be botting themselves if they had the means?
---
What about the warp back in distance after engagement? I'm pretty sure that is the keystone to the ambush
---
but let's be clear on the amount of zeros first. It's gonna have to be a LOT of zeros at the end.
---
I’m mad at bots because they ruin the game economy.
---
Not everyone plays the game like you. I’m a renter and I love to do home defense pvp...
---
Also, it’s very easy to catch bots, just identify wich citadel they’re warping to and drop a bubble there, go out system and back in 2-5 min and get them on the bubble.
---
I don't think anyone in Provi thinks otherwise mate. So yea.
---
What is the definition of "independent" in this context? Like if Test goes to war, are their no repercussions if Brave or Req don't join them?
---
Hell yeah
---
And here's another part of the problem. The amount of people who just want to build wealth and sit in the biggest or shinier ships has always been this large. Previously, with resource harvesting being slower due to no super miner rorqual it was much harder for the average line member to afford to rat in carriers or mine massive amounts of minerals themselves. The fact that resource harvesting is cranked up to 20 means that far more people now have the biggest ships in the game. The best place to get said ships is in an established umbrella. Only the pvpers and those wishing to go against the megablocs would be enticed to join a smaller alliance or small gang group to go against the bloc. Even then, income and resource gathering becomes overly difficult if you don't blue up with the closest bloc so you're limited to skirmishes. Going against a major bloc on a small gang format to defeat is equivalent to knocking down a skyscraper by punching it with your bare hands. In this case, small gang is an alliance with fewer than 20k members which us dad in and of itself.
---
Winning Eve is about having fun. Go blops Delve.
---
This is spam.
---
Yeah you did you wanna charge it up and warp off.  Otherwise why sit idly on grid while an MTU scoops ore?
---
Oh man Veto still rings a bell in my head, the LS boogeyman of my starting days in 2007. Tight knit pvp groups like yours, or mine today, were being nerfed to the ground sadly. I f you are part of a group now where you actually know all people, you are out of meta.
---
 the ultimate content! the final content?
---
Low sec is already on life support
---
This makes literally no sense.  
---
I’m saying relative to this shit poster whining, goons are better at converting the isk/mineral sources into weapons.   I didn’t say goons were perfect I said the problem was with the OP bitching about goons without acknowledgement that their alliance sucks at resource conversion.
---
Tell me where the quote is wrong tho
---
There is no win, there is only what is. The Imperium only wins if you believe being something like the Imperium (a super dropping blob and economic powerhouse) is the point of EvE. 
---
I get in wars with rivals, I setup ambitious plans, I work with a close group of people to pull it off. I can do this because I refuse to conform to the homogeneous love of absolute power which defines Goons et.al. 
---
I enjoy the fact that these superpowers exist and so many people are willing to submit their power to a state. These organizations form the backbone of my universe. They make what I do challenging, they make the cost of error great, they provide the hard resistance which imbues meaning into action.
---
So if you think EvE is won and all should be ended, then maybe your approach to the game does not reflect your desire. You bought someone else's dream and find it dull and played-out. This is a message from Bob: stop doing what you are doing and do something else. It will probably be dangerous. You will probably get your shit pushed in by 80 empire slaves who have nothing better to do than share an Athanor KM. But it will not be boring, I can promise that.
---
When I was in Test I remember the main enemy being goons but then the happening after the casino war caused the ire of Test to switch entirely towards Panfam it seems.  They(Panfam) did it to themselves really.

why are you assuming that bot authors are completely unable to write this trivial detection measure and patch all their bots within a week?  you can't just come up with things that will break a current bot.  that's trivial.  you have to come up with things that are not trivial to add to the existing bot, and this isn't it.
---
What’s the best way to make money flying solo today in EVE?
---
The only type of krabbing I hear of in wormhole space is the c5 and c6 super krabbing. I do understand that even thst can become limited if you get shitty connections. You're also risking billions of isk and sometimes you can't even see the enemy coming. It's almost like if you eant to be super rich in wspace, you have to risk a lot... hmmmm
---
But there is no real incentive to
---
If no one buys the sell orders the prices should go down bc of competition, the plex prices are rising so it can only means people do buy plex for isk
---
Don't br too sure
---
What would be the point exactly ? Bashing structures for months in Delve ?
---
Where it says TAPI is part of imperium.
---
Meh, sure, why not?
---
The 1000+ titans that make up the attacking force includes goons+init+bastion+smaller entities. Goons is the biggest single contributor but to get to that number you have to include the allies.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Also in creating more work to cash out, doesn't that also create more player opportunities?
---
Either the botter pays a hauling service, or hauls it themselves and risks giving out an even larger payout when ganked.
---
You could also play around with loot tables to have them drop more than overseer's effects for isk. Larger volume items of value could also complicate things for botters, either causing them to take the smaller loot-based payouts, or require them to dock up more frequently. Maybe have them drop damaged T1 rigs, that in industry can be repaired for half input material requirements or salvageable for straight, but minimal, minerals.
---
Salt from having to pay asset safety for titans
---
Yeah, if only Goons could find another sperging slime bag as thier head diplo again. And unite all Eve against them.
---
.. when you've had CCP in your pocket for 10 years.. yeah.
---
No, I asked where the quote was wrong, not to highlight the true parts
---
Hahaha. You are in an alliance that is the pet of Snuff. You never fight anything less than 2:1 odds in your favor even then that is usually not enough.
---
Is it any surprise that people force you to sit there shooting the damage cap of a structures for hours and hours on end instead of feeding you kills? You are part of a blob, that is the reality. 
---
Just wait until goons deploys to fight panfam this week and you are told to grind more structures. You won't get a fight, it will just be more damage cap. And then you will eventually go home with your many dozens of hours spent on structure kill mails, everyone will anchor more structures and the small alliance pvp will start up again. 
---
Weaponized boredom is indeed a real tactic so get used to it or join a group that is not a pet of trash players like snuff, who will never risk fighting 1:1
---
Scamming and stealing are probably the best options, but are heavily dependent on a player's creativity and aren't reliable. Other then that, assuming you only have 1 character, C3 ratting, high class abyssal sites, and blitzing burner missions all provide good ISK/hr.
---
&gt; Goons and legacy are allies
---
I wonder what series of decisions drove them together.
---
Goons super coalition is bigger than everyone else left standing lol. Imperium/Legacy/GOTG/PIBC is bigger than everyone left even if you count renters.
---
Goonzillions of isk.
---
The only way to win eve is to get a permanent ban on all your accounts.
---
Yeah not that's not going to be worth it at all.
---
EVE botting can earn you something comparable to an average income in a lot of regions, and the coding to be able to do it is worth it. 
---
All these suggestions that I see in such threads just do not make coder's life hard enough.
---
That's clearly not how you deal with it.
---
I actually left goons because "fun" for me does not include blobbing my enemy to death. Fun for me is taking 5 people to kill 30. The best way to so that is leave the 30 To join the 5. 
---
I can only hope that more of the true pvpers leave goons. Every lit but of experienced pvp leaving means the krabs are less protected.
---
lol no its a reference to this  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bp89mv/to\_all\_those\_people\_that\_say\_nullsec\_is\_dead\_stop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bp89mv/to_all_those_people_that_say_nullsec_is_dead_stop/) 
---
i just couldn't help to not meme. also im not HTP sadly. i like them through
---
Just remove sov altogether
---
Check that charts! Goons don't engage in botting and they don't facilitate it either.
---
it is enough
---
They don't call them CCPSwam for nothing.. referring to both GSF and CCP.
---
Goonswarm is an alliance.  There’s corporations within goons.  The game doesn’t recognize the bigger meta coalitions which are generally handled thru the standings systems.
---
Lol fuck no. We've seen how that turned out when NCPL turned around and evicted their allies and bulkheads against Goons coming back North. When the North got their asses collectively kicked last year, that was all Panfam's fault and Dorkness for sucking that NC dick and going along with the effort to evict CO2 and TEST. Goons are far more benevolent overlords than NCPL ever were. Anyone who was around during the time when they were "nomadic" knows how they went out of their way to be extra cancerous to the rest of EVE with their supercapital dicks by setting up in your neighborhood and farming everyone that lived there for months. Now that the rest of EVE can match them in supers they can't do the same thing anymore and it shows through their passive playstyle.
---
If, IF, it were even possible I'd callous my wang jerkin it with all that salt.
---
People r buying. Reselling higher price. Its traders atm driving prices.
---
DUST performed OK. And I launched more than one orbital bombardment myself, laptop and PS3 controller side to side.
---
3 Weeks reinforcement??? I live on the northpole and have internet for 1 week every 6 months. How am I supposed to be able to defend my structures? This isnt fair
---
&gt;Easy talk if you're in goons
---
I guess it's an interesting idea. But I feel like it's more of an annoyance to real players getting ninja'd than a bot would ever care about. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
---
I just feel like the real problem is that people want set it and forget it isk making. Park ship, click mine. Orbit object, assign drones. Both of those can be done, walked away from, and barring someone killing you, you can be positive that you'll walk back to isk. I've always felt like isk making should require interaction of some sort at all times and that the word AFK should have no place in your isk faucets.
---
thats alot of emotional investment into spaceship politics, friend. i'd rather smug about killing bigger stuff on a daily basis but thats just me.
---
This is the wrong part.  TAPI is not in the imperium.   We’re not in any way blue to goons/imperium.  
---
This seems to be a point of confusion with people?
---
By the way, EPIC post, 10/10, highly recommend, would read again
---
I guess you can accomplish a lot when your recruiting process involves mandatory visits to trojan-infested websites for 'registration' and requiring personal information such as home address, contact # and other information that can be used as leverage in RL... a lot.
---
Controlling a Lowsec Region with under 200 people, taking R64 from 2-10k alliances with 70-people Fleets dumpstering their 200+ Fleets because Skills &amp; Phoebe. Actually having a chance to matter at least at a smaller scale without having to join anonymous MegaCos
---
Just remove anomalies. Belt ratting 2009 style ftw!
---
A batphone is a batphone, but to call them alts is just ridiculous, and that's what I'm getting at. Your entire time in Provi, you've been calling HTP and RC a bunch of PL alts, when the actual PL came down and stomped you guys. Like, why would they create alt corps &amp; an alliance specifically to fuck with you when they can do so with the PL ticker?
---
I can't wait to hear we are going after TEST instead of NCPL.
---
Dude stop. You're starting to look real stupid
---
Those T2 BPOs that were handed to Alex sure went a long way...
---
The fuck are you sperging on about you mongoloid? You made a shitty argument because you're stupid and I called you out on it. I made no judgement on game balance.
---
Funny thing is I was thinking this exact same nearly spot on.
---
You forget how bad they actually are at the pvp part of the game...
---
Not sure if trolling or dinobrain. Nobody mentioned coalitions
---
Damn, the last sting in Delve, before its totally transformed into Hisec.
---
Industrial carebears from day one. paying for meat-shields and lap-dogs along the way. Not much to brag about.
---
That is a very good question. Their not on the store and there haven't been any giveaways that I am aware of. They are also still listed as a placeholder on the skin preview window. Maybe they were given away as part of the most recent EVE event?
---
I bet at least a few of them would leave for the sake of content. This shit is boring
---
Similar to the industry overhaul back in Crius
---
CCP should add some diminishing effects based on how close heavily populated systems are to each other, maybe through extended anomaly respawn timer or through sov that's up to CCP
---
Aka, nerf the amount of resources a few densely packed pockets could produce
---
Dominix with sentry drones
---
So, rather than risk your space pixels, you’d rather sit in high sec and ship spin? Who cares if you lose...? It’s a game.
---
Imagine thinking you are better than the person calling out your temper despite you throwing insults around.
---
The grid is over 50k km what u talk
---
&gt; EVE's user base will be 50-70% of what it is now
---
So it will be at 30% of what it was in 2013 ...
---
How is that?
---
I think that a band-aid fix could be for anomalies to respawn in the same constellation rather than always the same system.
---
Also randomizing the variant of anomalies. For example a rock Haven could respawn as either a rock Haven or a gas Haven. Maybe try to add in a 3rd variant of the high-end sites.
---
Also having pop-ups appear upon actually landing in the site grid, instead of just when you exit warp from initiating to the site.
---
i somehow doubt that test would want to be part of a temporary coalition after how the last one ended up
---
if immediately after a temporary coalition you evict your previous partners then that's the last temporary coalition that's going to happen with that previous partner
---
panfam made a bunch of stupid decisions and now they're dealing with those decisions eve isn't over or anything, panfam are just sore losers.
---
goons got back on their feet after their eviction, test got back on their feet after their eviction, if it comes to it i'm sure panfam can do the same if they care to
---
&gt; Had Panfam and the rest of MBC listened to us, the sov map would have looked very different than it does today.
---
Assume everything you said is true, wouldn't we just be in exactly the same position with Panfam/GOTG/Legacy against Goons? What does that actually change?
---
You mean, they were worried the crowd of EVE players known for remaining subbed while playing other games when waiting for pings would unsub when their new game was in fact connected to DUST?
---
Wut.
---
Judge ruined months of content, and enabled the blob to grow at an increasing rate.
---
Moon goo is also how you do the reactions now.  Reactions are profitable
---
You have never been in a wormhole, have you?
---
There isn't one for NS that I know of. The closest things to that are the [WH tracker](https://eve-tracker.org/whkills) and the [Abyssal Leaderboard](http://www.abyssaldata.com/).
---
My problem has been. Your capacitor is empty.
---
Smart people have learned those lessons and so it has become way less impactful over the years. Even sovdropping three regions was just one weekend of NCPL grinding it back up.
---
lol.Test and GOTG leadership is dedicated to having as many blues and renterss as possible, and PIBC is well known for doing it. Even if RR leaves GOTG to rejoin with Frat, and I dunno TKLE (the only legacy alliance other than test maybe worth a damn) swaps sides, the numbers are still insanely on goons/tests side.
---
I don't really see the mass inflation, i mostly see plex prices going up ( as the generally them isn't for prices to raise ), this means you money has the same value it's just that eve currency is getting weaker and weaker to RL money. 
---
Now this could come from inflation as the value of isk drops but because we lack secondary effects, now this means the supply demand of mineral sinks is also well a problem, as we see the isk to mineral ratio remain relatively static ( or even minerals drop in price rather then go up ) if we had inflation well we would see a raise in prices globally, the other option is that the demand is dropping so less players want ships ( the second one seems to match my observation where most folks that where active players 3 years ago barely login anymore ).
---
&gt;Just one special local delayed ship class.
---
Would force recons or covops exploration frigates fit this role to save CCP creating a completely new ship archetype?
---
remove 75% of the bounties.
---
Replace them with tags, not OPE. Make those tags required in some HS/NS LP stores. Make the tags types cosntant per CONSTELLATION (not region), with a part of the tags being pirat-wise(one tag type per pirat , eg serpentis or blood) and another part being constallation-limited (a group of constellation have the same tag group eg zeta/iota/lambda/sigma). So if I run blood anoms in a iota constellation, I will get iota blood tags. Those iota blood tags can be exchanged in amarr and eg serpentis LP store for iota items (eg all the gamma class implants require iota tags now, and/or the armor thermal hardeners, or the armot reps, or the armor generic hardeners, etc.)
---
result : if you krab too much you start devaluating your own value/h.
---
If you don't sell your tags you lose n important part of the value.
---
If you chase the bot away you can loot the field.
---
you people think bot makers are retarded or something? literally just add a flag to not shoot said rat and bounce the grid, bots are already able to prioritize targets, would probably be one line of code.
---
Who gives a shit? It’s a game. Wouldn’t you rather play and lose than be bored?
---
All these suggested changes from you and others won't change anything, bots will adapt.
---
Even unexpected combat related things like suggested in this thread you try to throw at the bot can be detected. 
---
Eve's simple gameplay makes it easy for bot developers.
---
Correct navigation has always been difficult for bot developers in general to get right. The bot needs to be aware of its current location all the time and either follows a static route or finds its own way to the destination.
---
The navigation in Eve is simple, a VNI bot needs to warp to an anomaly, orbit a rock and warp out. You just need to click buttons to do all of that, the game handles the movement. Can't get any simpler than that, even pixel based bots without memory reading can get the work done.
---
Eve bots suck at dealing with bubbles because they lack spatial awareness and only have a simple navigation system like "press warp and expect to be at that location seconds later" because that is all you need to make isk. After landing in a bubble they can't just burn to the opposite direction and try to warp to something in that direction.
---
The meta being CCP
---
Most people are just quitting the game becuase it sucks right now.
---
CFC
---
it seems to me you are falling to the same fallacy as a new player. ex: i am ''***so new that i surely cannot make a difference''*** and applying it to alliance level.
---
We both know that is false,  will you reconsider perhaps your statement? 
---
On a more humorous note content comes to delve i think.
---
They need to make content interesting and also difficult. The reason its so easy to bot is because you do not have to make any decisions for most anomalies other then 'kill tacklers first'. Plus botting ravens existed for forever, nerfing drones wont matter. 
---
Or just build a bot into the game or let us program routines directly in the game. Like PVP would come down to which side programmed their bots better.
---
I mean if it's repairing we will see humans spent 10/20 minutes on it specially new players as they don't realize why this rat is spawned while bots and experienced players will realize it in seconds
---
Making the group your detecting people that don't known about it rather then bots.
---
and then one day a week nullsec won't log in and instead will screech on reddit. 
---
Same as the demands for concordless highsec at certain times, people just won't log in, and a lot of those then just won't bother logging in again, ever
---
I've fought for both sides. I've also experienced being in an alliance that was evicted, lost a huge chunk of our members, and had to build back up from fuck all to where we are today. 
---
And from that perspective I've got no respect for this weak ass shit.
---
&gt; Lifeblood
---
Thanks for naming it explicitly. I remember argueing on the  (now gone, because of dieing out, think about why) german EVE forums half a year before the patchnotes even aired, how this change will destroy independant lowsec alliances income completely, and how the lack of collateral low mins mining on content/reactin/staging-Towers will spoil the T2-market as Rorqual Miners are Min-Maxxers that will just ignore everything below R16+ ....
---
Do you think this ties into how devs don't really participate in the bigger alliance structures and thus don't see how those systems aren't really up to date?
---
Ok, so i guess the "stealth" part is out of the question, alright, Long Range Drone fit then?
---
No. There is no viable hunting builds that are 'long range' (50+ km), usually because its hard to keep a target from warping away at that distance. If you really have a hard-on for drones, go for a close quarters t3 hunter fit that uses drones.
---
I'll make the powerpoint
---
The cyno cycle reduction indicates that force recons were initially developed as cyno hunters. Emergent gameplay showed that they are good in the EWAR support role. But people opt in all kinds of other ships for covert cyno hunting. Tengus, Lokis, even prospects. A local delay could give these ships their intended use back. However, perhaps it's be too OP since they also have limited DPS and great EWAR. You don't want big fleets of these ships roaming around with local immunity. You want 1 vanguard ship of this type. Hence this is why 0 DPS is really important.
---
Exploration frigates could do most of the job but 0 recalibration is really important for bot-catching.
---
So imho the optimal solution is still a new ship line, or a single faction ship Even.
---
New gates who are constantly swarming in NPC's who need to be cleared to unlock the gate? :thinking:
---
Wait, can sentries fire accurately from really long distances? I was thinking of the long range drone idea so they can go hunt down ships without me having to go into the usual lock-on range
---
YUP.
---
Asset Safety is great for QOL, terrible for content.  Part of what made EvE exciting was the idea of "This is real life. If something is in a box and that box gets blown up, welllll....so soz."
---
Now we have this ludicrous safety net.  MEh.
---
Evidently nothing, given that the other side is withdrawing their ships.
---
So, you can't both control drones and be invisible on-grid. There is the stratios that is a covops drone boat, and there are several ships such as Dominixs ans Ishitars that make very good long-range drone boats. Also, the only thing that increases your drone range beyond what your skills give you is a high-slot module, so it will compete for space with other things such as probe launchers and turrets. The domi is likely the only one with enough high-slots to fit 3 turrets, a probe launcher, and a savager and still have space for a drone link augmenter, but that will still only get you about 70km drone control range. Now, there are salvage drones so you can free up a high-slot using them instead of a dedicated savager. They will take longer to salvage though. Targeting range is a lot easier, you only need to fit 1-2 sensor boosters, then just script them for targeting range. Most drone boats fit an armor tank leaving space in the mids for said sebos.
---
What about me who shoots the Venture for no purpose other than I can? I have zero strategic goals beyond that.
---
&gt; CCP hates drama
---
But Drama is basically EVE's selling point in game media. This explains quite a bit.
---
this is the only realistic method of combating botting, and the reality is it's just not going to happen because ccp isn't going to put in the effort.  if a PvE activity is trivial to script it's going to be botted, and just changing what the script requires a little bit isn't going to do much.  almost all EVE PvE is basically something hacked in as a minimum viable product fifteen years ago, and i'm pretty sure based on dev comments that the code debt is enormous - i don't believe you can have any randomness whatsoever in a site layout, and stuff that you would think would be simple seems like it's just absolutely pulling teeth
---
they'd need to really address some serious code debt to deal with this and that doesn't seem like it fits CCP's "maintenance mode" mentality on spending.  i think that's why you are seeing more and more efforts to shift the blame for botting from ccp to...well, anyone else: they're not going to do anything about it, so all they can do is try to redirect anger elsewhere
---
only if there's a powerpoint involved
---
I’m unclear on what you mean by not being spotted. 
---
If you’re hoping to drop drones while cloaked, then unfortunately you can’t do that and even if you could you are not able to cloak or maintain your cloak within 2km (or 2.5km, I forget which) of something in space.
---
If you want drones that don’t travel to the target to apply damage you will have to go with Sentry Drones. You can not use drones when you are cloaked, even if they are still in space.
---
Drones for each race each have a different spread of stats (range, tracking etc) with Minmatar being faster at moving and tracking and applying less damage and Gallente being slower and applying the most damage. Amarr  and Caldari are in the middle with Amarr being the second best option for paper DPS.
---
If cloaking is what you are referring to then the Stratios is probably your best bet, it’s relatively affordable, easy to skill into and has scanning, cloaking, drone and turret bonuses as well as a bonus to armor resist which will help with fitting space.
---
In some games with similar risks as Eve, PvP is a viable way of capturing resources. Not so much in Eve.
---
It would be fitting for drone space but not constantly, that would just get annoying.
---
guess that place is screwed
---
You're a pathetic little bitch.  Go cry on a Minecraft forum or something.
---
man idk, not the fact that both their coalitions are more powerfull than PANFAM on their own, thats for sure
---
You're going to have to lock to give the drones command. You're limited by lock range as well as drone control range.
---
You mean flash form of a response fleet for a sudden attack of their staging fort will cyno in a cap fleet from a batphone? This move of ncpl was just "nah fighting bad"
---
[Yes.](http://reddit.com/r/X3TC/comments/8svm90/post/e13f2ov?context=3)
---
&gt;They instawarp and so must be caught with an interdictor, and the botters also will add the killers to a blacklist so you can't kill them twice easily (they'll cloak and warp off if a blacklist enters local).
---
so they're any decent explorer? i'm really failing to grasp why you are so sure they're bots and not just players hmmm
---
&gt; I pushed hard for completely changing EVE's login/account schema. I pushed for what I called a "WXYZ" structure for EVE accounts: one player could have "W" character slots, "X" of which are being used, "Y" of which can train concurrently, and "Z" of which could be logged in concurrently. To that, I suggested adding barriers that would allow players to segregate some accounts as being on a separate API for downloading of character information. So instead of EVE's ridiculous nature of multiple accounts, you'd have one account and buy (say) 15 character slots, you might have 11 of them in use, five of which might be training, and three of which you could log in concurrently. Then you could separate a bloc of those into a fake separate account which you could use for spying/meta activities. It was probably a bigger change than anyone in CCP was ready to make.
---
That seems better for players *and* easier to leverage into more income for CCP.
---
I imagine there's some legacy dev concerns in that though.
---
Now this is shitposting
---
Where should I go to find solo pvp? I tried roaming in null and low but no one would fight my wolf.
---
Good idea, and simple that can be implemented without major changes. I thought that perhaps another route is that you need to warp to a second room for the anomaly, which would have the other half. Your method is simpler and does add a lot more risk to getting your isk (you need to get the effects back to high sec).
---
It doesn't address mining bots though, which are a big issue for industry. Market bots probably have some effect, but I'm not sure how well they are done. Do people bot missions? I can't think this is a major effect on the economy. Another option CCP could do for both mining and ratting is add more scram rats, and not just frigs. If cruiser and BS rats had scram, that would add a bit more dicey risk to these activities. 
---
I haven't been in null in a while but it hasn't changed much the last few times I was there. It's boring and repetitive, which is why people want to bot. I think CCP needs to accept that people are going to bot their game and figure out ways to counter it through game design. As you rightly pointed out, this shaming + ban method isn't going to work. It's easy to do, doesn't require a lot of resources, and seems like it would be effective but botters do no care. They will continue doing it until they get banned and continue doing it with more alphas. There are always ways around whatever they come up with. Focus on what the botters demand, simple + repetitive + guaranteed return isk and remove what supplies those. Your solution removes the guaranteed return isk element nicely.
---
I mean personally i would say the best solution is make rats warp to close the gap, to force people to stay within 150 km of the rats, or really 75 otherwise they can warp to the other side and get closer. 
---
2 drop a bunch of AoE beacons on the site that well have an effect when shot ( this is to make the battle field conditions more dynamic ), so web towers/neut etc that draw there energy from gun fire, now make the rats behavior smarter and utilize these based on hostile position, now ideally you make the rats learning ( so the try new well random things so that orbiting vni's only stay optimal until the rats find a country and players have to find the next solution ). 
---
All of this being designed to make the enivorment unpredictable and make players adapt to changing battlefield conditions.
---
150 km is 93.21 miles
---
"Decent players"--very few maintain a personal blacklist. Instead they are aware of dscan and local as a whole and don't wait to get killed. Also don't generally give up or erratically launch and recall drones when caught.
---
Nor run 23/7.
---
So much this. Funny enough it's typically people from crowded alliances who say that, and always bring up Malcanis' Law.
---
For PvP or PvE?
---
PvP sniping you'd better off using a attack BC
---
PvE use sentry Dominix or Rattlesnake
---
I just want to defend myself against baddies that pick on me, i just want to use drones because i like the idea of sending mini fighters to fight for me while i peacefully do whatever i'm doing, like mining for example
---
PL/NC still have Horde, Frat, and skillu to meatshield for them.
---
Being invited into null &amp; taught how to run 10/10's, it was all gravy after that.
---
The best fix, imo, would be to tinker with how drone agro works.  Make the sites hate heavy drones while anything smaller than a battleship is on grid like ded sites do.  It would stop even afk vni rating not just botting.  You could still rat in a vni you'd just have to use varying drone sizes and pay attention.  As a byproduct it would slow down process quite a bit as well.
---
That's not the point. Imperium is at the top now, and they continue to reap the benefits of that position.
---
In 3 years, when CCP finally decides this is an issue, Imperium will have thousands of structures and hundreds of thousands of supers -- numbers far too large for players to actually do anything about.
---
The longer CCP does nothing, the worse this all becomes.
---
Its like when someone ruins a good CIV V game with science instead of conquest and culture.
---
Beep boop bot detected
---
Last time i checked i believe there were also rigs for drone range increase
---
"co2 members were fine with ignoring their diplomatic agreements when it suited them but then someone did it to them and they were angry and quit"
---
What if I make a bot that rats 8 hours a day? How can you detect the bot vs a player? It could even vary it's pattern so that it doesn't log in at exactly the same hours. VNI bots are pretty cheap to make, so I just need to make 3 times as many and I can bot all I want.
---
There isn't an easy automated solution for botting because (as OP said) they are virtually indistinguishable from real players if you examine them with an automated solution if the bot maker has at least half a brain.
---
The only way to guarantee solo is abyssal arenas. Otherwise try places like Amarr/Minmitar faction warfare or the staging system of a newbrow friendly null corp.
---
please do
---
We won the game years ago.
---
Eh, if you just burn someones space without taking it, it's a renewable resource.
---
diamond rats everywhere! Just switch it over one day, no warning. It'd be so hilarious
---
&gt;Anyone who was around during the time when they were "nomadic" knows how they went out of their way to be extra cancerous to the rest of EVE with their supercapital dicks by setting up in your neighborhood and farming everyone that lived there for months.
---
It was actually more pernicious than that. All the stuff you described happened, but, additionally, they looked out for the few folks who were enterprising enough to A) own a supercapital, or 2) FC, and poached them. So not only were they engaging in fish-barrel marksmanship, they were actively sucking the lifeforce out of the entities so pursued.
---
Oddly enough, they don't seem to be able to do that any more.
---
Ok then
---
Thats not going to happen. People have been fretting about a true blue doughnut and unstoppable forces since I started playing.
---
Nobody is going to be installed in whatever space they take. Goons will leave and the vacuum will be filled.
---
Of course they have, goons have been your allies for that time...
---
Ok so the cloak thing is out of the board, i guess i'll just focus on a long range drone ship fit, the kind where o can do whatever i feel like doing while my drones can ward off bots that pick on me
---
Mostly PVE so i guess one of those two then?
---
You have to be able to lock the target with your ship to give the command to your drones. You need to balance drone control range and ship lock range
---
I believe I mention why minerals havent gone up? Rorquals anyone? 
---
And what global prices do you refer to cuz t2 ships are almost double what there were even a year ago. We can say moon goo change is the catalyst but im more of the mind that players have more isk in general there for spend more. Uh drones have almost doubled faction at least which we can probably agree is due to alphas. But how do you not see the inflation? 
---
If there is less players logging in why has plex gone up so much? If there was less demand it wouldn't be rising so much.
---
Sounds like the X series to me lol
---
Drone rigs really tank your CPU though, so it's a balancing act there.
---
What about you? The world doesn’t revolve around you, sonny.
---
fresh new pve server
---
Needs to autodeploy on jettison.  Should have a companion module that can drop them into space like firing, think of WWII destroyers dropping depth charges.  Or trash, whatever works for you...
---
Screw the empire, all hail our new Triglavian overlords.
---
If Goons keep invading and occupy the entire   universe, who will populate those newly conquered systems?
---
Shitty renters? Or just left those empty space to rot?
---
Delve, Period Basis and half of Fountain is enough for Imperium's krabs
---
Once Goon's super fleet go back home, someone will come back from lowsec
---
the year is 2021. The United GoonMangos have every nullsec system under their control. the Resistance stages out of a c2-null static, starved for content. 
---
They send the occasional bomber fleet, hoping to grab scraps from the rorq armadas of United GoonMangos before the Defense Grid detects a distress signal and cynos 87 supers to the rescue. GoonMango Rollbots close wormholes within a minute of them appearing. 
---
the Resistance attempts to report each bot, but they are only met with an error message containing a link to install CCP's latest mobile game directly to your phone.
---
My computer desk is my eve shrine
---
If you want to mine, as you mentioned above, skill into the procurer. It is a very robust ship with bonuses to drone damage. You won’t be able to run a salvager however, but generally in Eve you’re better off specializing your ship rather than trying to be a jack of all trades
---
But you understand of course it takes "someone" to swap dollars for PLEX. All of the PLEX that is in game asides from specific giveaways conducted by CCP were all paid for with some currency or another.
---
Someone could have bought the PLEX as part of a sale for $20 in 2011. And could only today be used to Omega an account. That $20 was accounted for in 2011 probably 2012 on CCP revenue statement.
---
There could be 5 years or 5 minutes between the transaction. Don't think for a minute that CCP hasn't been paid. It has. And actually it get's paid and might never need to fulfill it's service i.e. giving game time.
---
:hypothetical: I have 6000 PLEX in my account e.g. 12 months of game time. What if I leave the game forever and never come back. It will sit in my hangar in Jita until they switch the server off.
---
Now "Someone" paid for all of that PLEX in fact it was multiple someones paid money into CCP bank. Me leaving now means CCP never need to fulfill the promise of honouring 500 PLEX for 1 month of Omega game time. CCP wins.
---
TL:DR I pay you $20 to come clean my windows, you never come clean my windows. You win.
---
finally a weapon to surpass metal gear
---
Then do something about it. What is your answer? Our leadership doesn't want to fight if we can't win. We can only hope Horde, Frat and SkillU are smart enough not to be meatshields and hold PL/NC responsible to lead by example.
---
It's kind of a pet idea of mine, but was there ever any discussion of changing cyno mechanics? I've been in the game for a long time and it's one of the few things that has never really changed.
---
Instead of the renter empires, i wouldlike to see hundreds of tiny alliances trying to evolve past each other to provide in the future more powerful empires to shoot against.
---
Hmm, maybe i use the overclocks? But i'd probably be missing out on some good damage for the drones, this proving more difficult than i have originally anticipated LOL
---
"PvP starts with roids"
---
We've fixed EVE.
---
He seemed to be confused that goons is an alliance not a Corp.
---
Yup. It was immediately obvious after UALX where the arrival of the Imperium super fleet before NC. resulted in the decision not to login after the node crash.  
---
OP is a bit of a slowbrain and just reacting/shitposting to current events.
---
I have a genuine question though? How are the bots created? Do they make API calls? I doubt it... is it image recognition ? Is it something else? I create robots for a living (not bots for games, but companies doing normal human jobs, trying to relieve stress and such)... and I did try to make a game robot(teaching kids how to code), but it seemed very fidgety with image recognition. Any ideas on how this is done ?
---
On books plex bought in 2011 on a sale not used isnt reflecting numbers/players in 2019. Thinking it does is insane. They need money this year not in 2011. So u add to fact that people who hord plex are hurting their bottom line. Sure it was all bought at SOME POINT but bills need to be paid now. So again. Money made on subs is much easier then money made in plex that is probly just being traded over and over.
---
Does your overview show TAPI/legacy as blue?
---
It depends on the boat and your skills, sometimes you have plenty of room for drone rigs and sometimes you need to make so many CPU sacrifices to fit them that it's not worth it.
---
We need horizontal scroll bars in windows.  Why can there be extra stuff hidden off to the side (hello, structure browser)?  Why should I have to make a window wider than I prefer, or even move it off the side of the screen to see more?  It took me years to realize EVE doesn't have horizontal scroll bars and it's baffling.
---
There are drone rigs that are useful outside of mining? Who knew.
---
Why wait? WH life is way more fun than nullsec blobs!
---
Everyday is brand new content with connections to random parts of k-space. 
---
If you're interested, send me a message!
---
Hi Jester, I don't have any questions. I just wanted to say thanks for the effort you put into your blogs. Way back when I was learning, they were invaluable reading. 
---
Good luck with whatever you do. o7
---
Can't wait to see NCPL leaving and building up a new strength just like we did in Delve.
---
jesus. how long to take gates
---
Sure :P
---
What if i instead told you i wanted to go gas wormhole cloud harvesting instead, i'd surely needed to get some tough ship against the locals, i tried going to one in a Venture and a few times went well, but one time i just got wrecked in the blink of an eye.
---
you do realize they use pvp to protect their pve activities, right?
---
also, you might consider recruiting some people who want to do pve if you think it's such a strong weapon
---
You need PVE in order to build your pvp ships you absolute retard
---
I'm actually mad because they are destroying the economy.
---
Longest range you'll get is with sentry on a Dominix iirc, 3 DLA 2s, 3 Omni 2s with Optimal scripts. I believe that can get you about 150km control range and 110km optimal with sentry drones. You could go further with even more DLA/Omni but that's getting into the range of pretty damn stupid and pointless. My numbers might be off I didn't run it through Pyfa yet.
---
It would help if we know more specifically what you are trying to do. Most fits are based around preforming a specific task well, where the more general the task the less effective the fit is.
---
We're you in test for like a day? Do you not remember PL literally farming them forever? Before pgl, vily and elo joined they would get shit on by pl constantly. Goons were on the complete opposite side of the map and hardly a thought.
---
I watched a fleet of 10 Rheas jumping into and out of a system in period basis yesterday whilst I was in local with combat probes out. I put it down to someone being rich enough not to give a fuck.
---
Sure am.
---
I didn't specify they were good for outside of mining, i just remembered that i saw some rigs for them as well, aside from the high slot ones
---
Wars are won by economies and industry in real life as in eve.
---
What's so hard to understand about that?
---
Ps .. I dislike goons
---
yeah CFC basically..
---
What happens next?
---
CCP goes CCP Falcon master race and just activates EVE gate for the last time and sends everyone back to stone age again, everyone starts crying muh titan ticks but harsh decisions needs to be made spodbrains so fuck you and your castles because we want out game back so HTFU!!!
---
Shit starts to come through it and it's freaking spooky as hell and noone knows who they are and what is going on.
---
EVE 2.0 HTFU expansion come to you May 6 2020
---
pretty much every group but panfam has lost a war and made themselves stronger from it
---
goons lost in the north and moved south and started rebuilding
---
test also lost in the north and moved south and started building
---
frat lost against test and spent 6 months building
---
maybe panfam will figure out what needs to be done after they risk eviction as well
---
&gt;The blue donut isn't measured by the portion of the map that's blue, or by the number of alliances bluing each other. It's measured by the number of individual people blue to each other. That ratio has never been as high as today.
---
Who knew peace time was so profitable?
---
So, in wormholes, the gas sites spawn NPC enemies 15 or 20 minutes after you warp to the gas site. What you want to do is what people refer to as “ninja huffing”. The idea is to warp in, harvest the most valuable gas deposit until just before the NPCs arrive, then leave and move onto the next gas site.
---
Yes more than a day, you're wrong, great talk.
---
WINE is fine if you have used to that. The support from CCP for it is amazing, considering Linux has only best effort support.
---
Any case, I have libvirt managing qemu+kvm with VGA pass-through. The setup is mainly for other games, if ever I play those. Arch Linux wiki has quite good coverage about this kind of setup.
---
This is good.
---
I'm an independent now and it got me back in to eve. Just camp these Japanese dudes in a c1 for my pvp content and run all the relic and data sites when they are in bed for isk.
---
It's a nice little setup..no comms..no politica... no discord pings it's great
---
&gt;The thing is, we don't all play their game.
---
Yeah you do.
---
&gt;  And then, you can amass all the wealth you want, and join proper online mode, kill some noobs, and then go back to amass wealth in offline again while claiming that you "pvped"
---
Unironically sounds like living in Delve
---
yeah, that's called  a collision. Collisions are mandatory as long as you don't have an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective\_function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function) , which require to have same domain and co-domain dimension if infinite, or size if finite. Which is the opposite of the goal of a hash, that is to have a co-domain of reduced size/dimension.
---
So, indeed, a complete retard idea.
---
Ok my main goal here was to have a ship to harvest gas clouds and be able to defend off against enemies while not having to worry about running away or getting wrecked into pieces, so i thought of long range drones as they might help a lot
---
I was trying to make a joke, but you are correct. I did forget about those rigs.
---
What about linking to individual entries?  Might help with discussion of issues on there.
---
Needs to spam local
---
After playing for over 2 years I just learned about l4 fw missions 3 weeks ago. This pretty much ended my space poverty. Thanks calmil! 
---
Hs missions are crap tho I agree.
---
The problem with “WH life” is that it’s entirely depends on hunting in null-sec statics. Remove static’s to null-sec and you remove almost all WH life.
---
XD
---
I  laughed much more than I needed time to understand the joke :P
---
Since it seems you are sticking around this thread for a while, I just wanted to thank you for all the goodposting and overall everything you did for EVE. The insights you've offered in your blog and this subreddit have always been worth reading, and especially during controversial times, you stood out as a voice of reason among the sperglord crowd.
---
I don't have a question and in the future I know I'll regret not having one, but eh, whatevers.
---
The people said EVE is boring are the same that are playing EVE at the same time
---
You just want to bitch on someone
---
Move on
---
Will u pay me more than goons can?
---
very cool, thanks for posting
---
Ok, i could try that, but the wrecks for the sleepers are sometimes quite valuable, that's why i wanted to both harvest AND kill those rats
---
1.0000000000000000 isk.
---
I think best of round check and trace the migration of bot wallets. More important find a  Don Corleone(non-troleone) than ban another bot #1102202
---
With explo you give your soul into rngesus mercysless  hands. 
---
I'd say 20-30 mil per site is a good average, but getting only 11m or less isn't uncommon.
---
I R8 Ur B8 -8/10.
---
To OP's idea. Like wormholes, get rid of bounties and make it that every NPC in an anomoly drops blue loot that must be sold to NPC buy orders. Being that VNI's have to speed tank to run the sites, hence not being close to the MTU. Neuts come into to local, VNI ratter has to make the choice to try and burn to the MTU or warp out losing all value from that site.
---
So, the only ships you want to use to harvest gas in is either a venture or a prospect, neither of which will be able to effectively clear rats itself. The reason you use them is that the bonuses on the ship make it such that 2 harvesters on a venture are more effective then 4 harvesters on any other ship. This means you are clearing the site with one ship and huffing in a second. Now, what type of site are you trying to huff gas in? WH sites or k-space sites, and what level of WH. A Gila will be able to just face-tank the site but can be expensive. Easier sties can be cleared with something a cheap as a vexor though, so knowing is important.
---
Wait for goons to die or the game to die
---
&gt;  one-cycling a structure .... denies the defending group the chance to respond and actually have a fight
---
I would oppose that. 
---
One cycling was often done by small entities with good skills like independant Lowsec-Groups, especially before Phoebe to net get dropped by bored PL-Pilots from the other end of the universe.
---
It was actually done to trigger a fight, and not avoid it as the fight happened AFTER reinforce time and not on reinforcing it ...
---
Can’t it be both?
---
The problem is that most interaction demands can better be filled by a bot than a human.  You have to take a meta look at it, unfortunately.
---
I mean, EVE isn't anywhere NEAR as boring as Elite Dangerous. So there's that.
---
&gt;We've seen how that turned out when NCPL
---
They cannot constructively govern, but they could unite to invade Delve.
---
go to geminate, us horde will fight you. branch is good too, tons of easy bot kills but they hellcamp you after a bit. provi might be good too but havent been there
---
Raw chicken liver is a better fishing bait than this.
---
Also, something to note is that a venture has +2 warp core strength. A warp disruptor has a strength of 1 and a scrambler has a strength of 2. Unless you are caught by someone with enough disrupters and scramblers you will be able to warp away to huff another day. 
---
Interdictors are an exception, they produce an interdiction probe which will prevent a ship of any warpcore strength from warping ( unless you’re nullified, but this is very specialized and not relevant to your objective)
---
Your defense against interdictors is to frequently refresh your Directional Scanner which displays all ships within 14.3 au of your location, giving you time to warp out before the ship lands on grid with you.
---
In response to you wanting the wrecks for salvage, if you find the correct Gas sites you will make a great deal more ISK by just huffing the good stuff
---
I like the idea of removing direct to wallet isk payouts from anoms. Instead the reward is a sort of overseer effect that can be sold at concord stations for set amount of isk.
---
Overall the amount of isk gained could be the same. But it increases the effort and risk slightly for farmers. And it will create some fun and juicy kills.
---
I don't believe the game would be in the same position with different names. 
---
The play styles of each MBC member were different, but ultimately leaned more towards PvP. When CO2 and TEST were forced to move, we knew we had to build up our own arsenals, as Panfam was right on our tails - this in turn changed the way we played to favor getting more industrial so we could better arm ourselves against the boogeyman that PL used to be.
---
I really need to get back into Eve, I miss the drama, politics and allaince shifting that was far more interesting that real life.
---
I like to do WH ones, doesn't really matter what level, so long as i can find gas clouds i'm good
---
The problem is that it slows legitimate player earning at the we rate that it slows bot earning, so it does nothing to offset the devaluation of ISK/Plex, which you discussed above
---
let's get some data before we keep going as headless chickens: 
---
So T2 ships have no gone up in price if we take the 
---
Cerb: https://evemarketer.com/types/11993/history 
---
or the munnin: https://evemarketer.com/types/12015/history
---
Both where about the same price last year as this year, so that seems to not match your data / prediction or w/e. 
---
Faction drones to show the rice. 
---
Now my reason i suspect plex is going up for a set over reasons.
---
1. No time pressure anymore so people can slowly grind up isk for that month of omega regardless if they can do it in a month or a year, this means the barrier to plexing your main is a lot lower. 
---
2. Extractors, the both consume plex and allow to offset most of the cost, along with increasing the demand for plex it also allow people with lower income streams to plex again reduction in the barrier to entry of not paying.
---
Now full disclosure i assumed a drop in plex trade volume but that's not in the data so it can't be based on the supply shrinking. 
---
Now if it's pure based on mineral inflation then well stuff like nano-factories would also go up in price: https://evemarketer.com/types/2869/history this again doesn't seem to reflect a inflationary theory.
---
So disappointed. Their leadership is defeated, so they are defeated.
---
All this has happened before and all this will happen again.
---
So, C1 and C2 sites can be cleared with a vexor quite easily. Otherwise you can use a passive gila and clear C3 sites as well. The gila hull is somewhat expensive though at about 200mil. Your other option in ninja-huffing, where you huff gas until the rats appear then move on to the next site. If you mess up you can easily loose you venture, but they are cheap to replace.
---
It's no coincidence that nearly every medium-sized low-sec group died in the year after Lifeblood. It was insanely destructive.
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but there has never been a time goons would pass on a chance to blue ball strategically. Which is certainly not fun.
---
Fake News. GalMil never had to batphone Snuff to wreck the caldari, that was just their excuse for repeated failures when they realized they were totally outmatched on even terms.  Squids just got mad about the mere \*possibility\* that GalMil (really just RDRAW) \*could\* batphone Snuff.  In reality GalMil fought all the caldari, and all \*their\* batphones they relied on just to match just our forces, all without Snuff ever needing to undock.
---
He also understands the critical symbiosis of the operator and the supporter/enabler.  When the two become invested in each other, they become unstoppable.
---
Thanks, Jibrish. And yeah, there's still 10-20 Replies a day appearing in my notifications, as (I assume) people come late to the thread. I'll stop posting when it drops off.
---
&gt; maybe panfam will figure out what needs to be done after they risk eviction as well
---
We've already working it out. The answer is to just stop playing if the only option is to hoover up every mouth breathing retard to rorq mine.
---
You are right, MBC was created to exist only a short while to go up against a much larger foe. The problem is we didn't finish the job - TEST knew this, told the other MBC members, and was promptly ignored. 
---
As for doing the Imperial Legacy thing, we absolutely were forced into it, lest we lose our home yet again to a much larger collective force, which was the case during July of last year when TRI, PL, NC,  Frat, and The Rest Of Eve^^tm came after us. Not everyone likes being a nomad.
---
Maybe do a few tweaks to sec status, possibly make it the more farmed the high the status gets. For example have a -1.0 turn into a -.1 if it becomes over farmed, and reverse for those systems ignored.
---
Reason I say this is cause I support a whole region can support a single alliance, and proposing changes that get people to spread out more, can be bad for the smaller alliances trying to grow, and better for the larger alliances who have the number to evict smaller guys.
---
Panfam in full damage control "eve is doomed" mode before goons even start deploying has to be the cringiest thing on r/eve this year.
---
It creates a problem where CCP devs can't see the problems with the game created by the scale at which EVE players play it. For example, I pretty much guarantee they don't get the variety and capability of the out-of-client tools that big alliances (are forced to) use to compensate for the short-comings of the in-client tools.
---
Given the relative amount of harassment we get from NCPL and Goons, would not likely put any effort into helping to protect NCPL.  Probably wouldn't help Goons either, but I don't think they need help either.
---
Lol, bitter much?
---
As a wormholer, I’d probably spring for it. K space, nah.
---
K. I was there, I remember. You obviously weren't.
---
Literally when they batphone tons of people lol. Every fleet is basically a normal fleet until we hear them batphone another entity then it becomes /sigh fuck this fight.
---
Fuck no.
---
Back when we had to walk uphill both ways.
---
Make it so that you can’t hack a new site until your last site is cleared or despawned.  Most explorerbot suspects I’ve seen in Sansha space only loot cans with multiple intact armor plates.  If you force them to open or destroy every can in the site, that leaves them uncloaked and vulnerable for several minutes.
---
What to do about cynos is one of the things that's been bouncing around inside CCP HQ for years. For example, most of the devs involved *hate* the fact that a single noobship can bring in a force of dozens of titans but they're not sure what to do about it. They feel that a lot more risk should be involved somehow. Various proposals have been put in front of them to solve it with no effect yet. Mine was to have the total mass (in kilograms) of ships that can jump through a cyno be a function of the mass of the cyno ship. Another common one suggestion is to have more incoming ships require more LO the way Jump Bridges work.
---
Not understanding the inevitable outcome and preparing to deal with it. You can still take "good-fights" on the way out while being honest about it with your members and allies.
---
Oh, you want to resurrect MBC ? I mean this coalition was made because 54 alliance hated goons I guess it disband because they no longer hate it right ? Or does it as an external cause (Hey lenny )
---
This. As a whale Hunter I can say that no one else responds to aggression against their miners with the haste and viciousness of the goons
---
i have no really strong opinion (could work or not) about this, but i would assume that moving from an system based anom/index system to an constellation wide, would require huge efforts within the spaghetti code.
---
tell me more
---
no really, please elucidate
---
You can't burn it if there's nothing to burn :smart:
---
You know, I didn't think of one until today: Arrow wanted to redo the Overview... with another Overview that only had about five columns and much bigger text, but a max of about 20 rows. It was hard for all of us on CSM8 not to laugh in his face. Our general consensus was "You want to replace an on-screen spreadsheet with a smaller, less useful on-screen spreadsheet? And that's your best idea for how to redo the Overview?"
---
and nice reddit cta they pinged on their discord, i went from far in the positives to -3, not that it does anything else than amuse me ...
---
lol, the first Fuck in this thread is from you, you hypocrite XD
---
While i assume that something like that would require a huge effort within the code, i think the idea of dimishing effects could be interesting. But i'm thinking now more about Structures which would affect the spawn/quality of system negatively. Just as a citadel spam prevention actually, and also this whole thing just jumped out of my head without much thinking about further consequences.
---
I'd be surprised if you ever got much of a reward like that. It's more likely that the bot would warp to a citadel every few sites and deposit the loot.
---
PL/NCDot have always been fucking us way harder than goons ever did. We clapped goons and they clapped us the fuck out of Fountain and then left us alone while PL/NCDot spent the next 4 years trying to kill us for fun.
---
Risk my space pixels for those untrustworthy, ungrateful, incompetent, and toxic fucks that make up the north?  No thank you.
---
&gt;Does your overview show TAPI/legacy as blue?
---
Classic.
---
I had some RL stuff crop out so I couldn't edit the theme for this. Felt bad about it when I saw you still answering :(
---
interesting idea, but just up the notch a bit, and if system is at ADM 3 the system react like lowsec for the not-owner, and if ADM is 5 it is like Highsec and with ADM 6 not-owner of the system can't do pvp-actions, and get concord-kinda deffense for the owners in system...:P
---
I have had several similar thoughts as you, like moving the isk rewards to overseer effects or blue loot. Another solution would be to increase the difficulty of the sites, namely increasing the number, speed, and tank of frigs that tackle, thus making the bots much easier to catch. Botting carriers could even be caught by this. The counterplay that any actual person could do would be to change to light drones to quickly kill the tackle frigs, but this would likely be very difficult to code, and havily increases the vulnerability of the bots.
---
like CFC-propaganda!
---
if I've got access to unlimited accounts, I just put an acct on every gate. Put them in a cloaky ship and SP farm them, you're not out a lot of isk. By using computer vision on the overview I can now meta together a map where I know where players are by monitoring gate activity. Now you've just given bots a distinct advantage over players.
---
You can get even fancier and have the bots look for new WH's showing up in system if you'd like, as well as using DScan to double check their assumptions.
---
At the end of the day I could write code to potentially overcome any of the fixes suggested in this thread. CCP really needs to focus on the money stream and having better analytics tools to follow the isk compared to trying to stop botting. You stop the flow of money, you stop the bots.
---
I like the idea and have often wondered whether it was reasonable to just go full High-Class J-Space on how Null Anoms work. Something like:
---
1. Rats drop tags instead of bounties. Tags need to be looted and taken to HS to realize their value.
---
2. The main waves of the site are worth about half of the total value of the site.
---
3. During the last wave a beacon decloaks. It is optional. If you shoot it it spawns a mega rat that drops tags worth the rest of the site.
---
4. Said mega rat can't be handled by a solo AFK VNI. It webs and scrams and will try to warp off in low armor if it isn't pointed.
---
5. If you spawn a mega rat and don't kill it, it just goes on a rampage in the system until someone does.
---
6. If you warp in a capital, a group of anti-cap rats jump in which are both hard to kill and worth very little.
---
If it's just about passive isk and keeping ADMs up you can just skip the mega rat and go about your business. It's low risk and you get lower reward. If you want the big isk you take a bigger risk.
---
Imagine bringing RL-Morals to ingame politics of an RPG.
---
Remember the "dark harsh place" statements from CCP, what gigx wanted to do would have been substantially more healthy to this game than everything that happened after ...
---
Not like we got drove out of the north by the north or anything.  Not like the north then spent the next 18 months trying to farm us in the south.  You guys sure didn't do anything like that.
---
Give a chance for every last item in that cit to drop, then what doesnt drop goes to asset safety. Some items safe, some reward for bashing.
---
It's weaponised boredom. It happens when you blob and bat phone too much
---
Cowardice on one of the two sides. Wont say which one to not derail the thread.
---
LOL, no.
---
We had a blast living in Lowsec (Aridia) 2013-2017. But after realizing we would have to chew on rocks for multiple hours a week per person to maintain our income we said fuck it ...
---
I personally had to send nudes of myself when I joined, thought it was standard practice in nullsec alliances??
---
lmao

Not really a bot lacks the ability to do 2 very import things or well the quality of bots your likely to be fighting if google puts it's full AI budget on automating your game your well fucked. 
---
1. is realize when stuff gone peer shaped, like AI is horrible in realizing the data there getting back doesn't match the learning data in anyway, people will often point this out. 
---
2. dealing with dynamic state games where mid game it's hard to identify a winner and loser even with perfect information games like GO this has often been troubling for AI i known GO has been solved but the more you make ratting like GO the harder it becomes to bot.
---
Time to go after their renters and attack their income if they don't want to fight.
---
Rock on!
---
&gt; if I've got access to unlimited accounts, I just put an acct on every gate.
---
why does everyone say this? this doesn't compensate for local in the slightest, you can't tell if people log into your system, nor blops in.
---
&gt;DScan to double check their assumptions.
---
DScan can't differentiate between someone decloaking and cloaking back up versus being blopsed in, and getting full system coverage is roughly 5 alts per system on average not even including gate scouts.
---
&gt;if I've got access to unlimited accounts
---
You don't, no one does.
---
&gt;At the end of the day I could write code to potentially overcome any of the fixes suggested in this thread.
---
you can't, I enter system, bring a blops in, bridge a ship in, and blops my main out and you'll never know who entered system, who is in system, and what they're in.
---
&gt;You stop the flow of money, you stop the bots.
---
you remove local, bots are consistently huntable and inefficient
---
at no point in history did blowing up stations destroy assets.
---
ah the old "let us win or i stop playing"
---
if panfam cant handle losing maybe pve is actually what they're looking for. players always win pve. in pvp sometimes you lose
---
politics and economy have always been part of holding sov, it's not for everyone, there's always faction warfare or wormholes
---
Exploration
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
It doesn't fix the problem entirely - No one change will, and botters (if dedicated enough) will find a way around it, but I hope it would be a positive addition to the existing combat system.
---
yeah i'm sure they aren't crybaby little bitches
---
Almost like fucking over your allies can have long term consequences I guess.
---
How would that help anything
---
Ok well, i guess we should first define here what an "single alliance" is, are we talking about 2k members? or more like 5k, 10k, 30k ? So saying in general a single region should support a single alliance, could be right or wrong imho.
---
While i agree partly with the smaller alliances, i also see the current status. Huge areas of eve nullsec are right now renting space; some of these regions are mainly populated by bots. As a small alliance there is right now just only a small amount of space left which the big coalitions don't really care about, until you piss them off by something. 
---
Even in the worst case, so when this won't reduce the amount of bots, it would at least reduce the amount of empty systems, and lower the amount of capital projection within the regions.
---
Evan Mcclean is looking for a new corp soon, can he join Habit?
---
Because you can put different crystals in each gun and shoot a rainbow.
---
We can always burn poco's
---
I mean one set of guys is pissing themselves screaming 'the sky is falling' and ripping up structures, all before an actual invasion target has been announced.
---
RC was considered to be PanFam alts because I was in PL when RC became well known.
---
I've not been in PL since August 2017, and was pretty much inactive since December 2016. That said my personal friendship with many of their members is still strong, and we'll help each other when the call is made. 
---
The reality is the daily content in Provi has nothing to do with PanFam. We don't batphone them to kill Provi. We call them in to deal with your own batphones. When we don't, this happens: https://br.inyour.space/?s=3707&amp;b=8589720&amp;e=90&amp;t=vbrerbaq
---
Probably more accurate to say PanFam lost Eve Online. NCPL in particular were in great shape post WWB and stubbornly refused to scale up in the new meta. They threw it away and deserve everything the Goons throw at them! Let's see how "elite" NCPL are now!
---
None of this changes the fact that your current alliance is allied with goons and together are currently and unstoppable force capable of n+1 Titan dick swinging across the entire game. So saying to just toughen up in this scenario is vastly different than the troubles you personally faced in the past. It's not a matter of just undocking.
---
Yes, while another is pissing on their pants hoping the 3rd party puts an actual fight.. or the inevitable war with their “allies” start sooner than expected.
---
Totally agree, I had the same idea below. I'm really surprised how few tackle NPCs there are in missions and anoms.
---
I view it as a "great risks bring great rewards" scenario.
---
Even flying through delve is risky... there can be a cloaked titan on any gate.
---
A lot of times you can get lucky, boosh some excavators and lol out...  Sometimes you try to drop on a rorq, and he immediately cyno's up and drops a fleet...
---
Other times, you tackle a supercarrier, who panics and doesn't know what to do and dies in a fire because he can't ask for help.
---
I think a lot of the saltiness around all of this is because goons figured out the way to win is by embracing industry, logistics, and empire building.  A lot of other groups decided that things were okay the way they always were, and they are now so far behind that I don't know if they can catch up.
---
That's a complete non-answer to what I was asking.
---
If Panfam hadn't kicked TEST/CO2 out of the North and instead kept them as best buds, what would things look like now?
---
GSF doesn't have a discord.
---
Most people are quitting now because they are no longer on the winning side after a decade. FTFY
---
Who says that...no one calls them that lol.
---
&gt; Imagine bringing RL-Morals to ingame politics of an RPG.
---
yeah, gigx made a mistake bringing game grudges into rl
---
&gt;Remember the "dark harsh place" statements from CCP
---
no
---
&gt;what gigx wanted to do would have been substantially more healthy to this game than everything that happened after ...
---
i'm not sure what gigx wanted but gigx didn't have power to change anything so i'm not sure why you bring it up
---
Just so I understand - you want CCP to intervene and do something about the Imperium, because the Imperium  found a way to be on top of the game and mechanics CCP gave to everyone who plays or has ever played Eve?
---
So your solution is to put all anoms in bubbles or accept people will bot?
---
We've been doing that already.
---
Okay, the first thing is day to day standings don’t matter at all. Goons and test don’t shoot each other’s rorqs, help out on strategic ops, and will blue each other for those ops. 
---
And by your own numbers, Legacy and Imperium are the two largest coalitions. Not sure what you’re point is because you’re saying one thing but posting numbers which prove the opposite. 
---
And Tapi is a pet of goons because they need goons a whole lot more than goons need them. They were losing in the east until they blue’d goons last year, and they’d be losing to WinterCo now if they didn’t have goon backup. They also used to have terrible relationships with goons, and now their main FC is calling WWB the “Casino War”, something he never would have done on his own. Right now they have to do what the goons want or goons will just pull their support and let the east evict Tapi with PL support. 
---
As for entities who aren’t pets of goons, that would be Panfam, WinterCo, Slyce (although they’ll probably wind up as part of Panfam soon), SkillU, nearly all wormholers, and those eastern alliances I mentioned earlier. Also all of lowsec except Snuff.
---
You have to understand.
---
It is okay for everyone else to have "bluetrals" but not for goons and TAPI to have them.
---
I mean I was in init till I quit but sure
---
This may seem like a low bar but I'm glad they at least realize and dislike how it's working. Thanks for AMA Jestertrek, it means a lot as I'm sure you noticed. Kinda shows how starved the players are for more interaction and feedback....
---
....and the more it is farmed, the longer the delay for someone to show up in /local.... 
---
I like it :)
---
Everyone uses the Loki for hunting. Not for exploration.
---
Tengu is like a Drake 2.0, so it's pretty popular for easy tanking and missiles.
---
I prefer the Legion because you don't need mountains of ammo, just a handful of crystals.
---
And... Nobody really uses the Proteus, lol
---
I'm referring to the general sky is falling narrative the last year. People that once blobbed everything getting their dose of karma botching about it.
---
Are you implying that GSF leadership gives even the smallest shit about your opinion?
---
There will always be more bots, no matter how many you ban. It's cheap and easy to do.
---
Besides, ratting is boring af. What ideas do you have to make ratting better and limit botting then?
---
I think you're missing the point by getting hung up on details.
---
&gt; So you brought 500 guys to ref an Astra? Well next time maybe you will only get 400, the next 350
---
Say I brought 40 dudes to ref a Fortizar (which as it so happens is something I _actually_ did last night). That Fortizar is going to take at least 24 minutes to rf, the defenders bottle it and don't fight. Say 10 of my guys have dreads in range they're happy to drop, there is currently no benefit whatsoever in doing that, nor is there any way for me to make this grind go faster. Is that really good gameplay?
---
That was more an experiment than anything.
---
We mostly wanted to smack Hard Knocks for being the cunts they are.
---
&gt;If panfam can't handle losing
---
People seem to forget just how much we lose. We've lost more big super fights than pretty much any other group in the game. We've lost a whole lot, and pretty repeatedly, so we're pretty good at handling losing. 
---
We play the game the way we want, and if we can't do that any more then we'll just stop playing. We could have adapted the whole Delve Mk.2 style at any point if we wanted to, but we don't. We will keep trying to play our game, and when we can't we'll stop.
---
I really don't think panfam is going to feed. They are unachoring everything already and moving to npc stations. A wise idea and a massive blueball dealt to imperium pvpers again.
---
Must be pretty boring to be goons if you enjoy pvp
---
I don't think, in defense of PL/NC, that you could have finished the job... and PL/NC knew it.
---
Imperium was watching the moves of the MBC very carefully.  If you would have followed them down, they would have pulled back to NPC Delve, and waited for you guys to get bored.
---
It is easy to forget in hindsight, but that was a pretty long fight, and goons basically blueballed the entire end of it (probably as part of a strategy tbh).  Following them would have led to more blueballs, and the same inevitable outcome.
---
Unless you wipe out the backbone of the Imperium... which is a crazy, autistic group of people who don't care about good fights or structure grinds, just empire building and completing objective, you can't really kill them off.
---
Honestly I mostly quit because even traditionally nomadic pvp alliances like INIT are basically locked into owning and living in sov now, which isn't fun for me (and a lot of other people).
---
From what I've seen there are astero bots that roam around and do relic sites fit with triple istabs that just warp off when something comes on grid or decloaks. So a hack most likely won't stop them.
---
He's too active for Habit.
---
Hey man if that's what you find fun, who am I to take that away from you?
---
ok goodluck in faction warfare
---
I mean, you see the same behavior in the real world.
---
NATO and the Warsaw Pact?
---
Axis and Allies?  
---
Allies and the Central Powers?  
---
Nations buddy up when their interests align and there are external threats they can't easily handle alone.  Risk reduction is very practical.
---
How do you get the hunter in other than logging on/off? You'd just stop ratting in that system for a sufficiently long time, and you could even track where the blops are based on where you've lost a vni recently. It all seems like a really inefficient way to deal with bots. I've done a lot of blops, and let me tell you how fucking boring it is dropping on VNIs. Unless a roaming gang can kill the bots, id rather just let them be. You aren't making isk off of it (probably breaking even on fuel) and are having to use significant effort with logoff traps. 
---
I just don't think it's enough and more focus should be put on creating a tool that can track transfer of isk. You make it harder to get the money off the bots and into people's wallet, and magically you lose the bots.
---
Jesus, get his balls off your chin
---
&gt; would force the bot to warp off if it randomly targets the bot-catcher NPC first of the wave, and can't kill it
---
Using my very large brain... I have already gotten around this. Standard check for the bottleneck NPC... AND NPCs on overview = 1 before warping. That would just cause more of a pain for real ratters, as an AFK VNI would get stuck.
---
I think if they regionalized things more there could be a lot more pockets of small groups, but that would mean getting rid of things like wormhole connects and capitals being able to jump or bridge or reduce the range by 50 % so they have to slow boat a lot further, but can still be a strategic drop asset. Only allow blops to jump. Also, would need to get rid of nullified on everything except yachts.
---
Bots can't right click -&gt; use filament silly
---
Lol, there were people from PL/NC asking for the very system that we have right now.
---
Goons adapted, Aryth was screaming on The Meta Show telling everyone else what they needed to do.
---
Only TEST has really listened.  Everyone else wanted easy renter isk.
---
This is the result.
---
Yep, SNUFF is in reality what NCPL think they are.  
---
Not really interested in holding a lot of Sov...content to have a few places to dock shit up in quiet / undesired regions and they just bounce around wherever they want to generate their own content.
---
NCPL are just fat and lazy resting on the laurels of long-past achievements and long-since inactive players.  
---
IMPERIUM ought to kick every one of their sandcastles down and motivate them to be something better than they've chosen to be left to their own devices.
---
\&gt;  The highest priority in game design has to make the game fun for the players, not to make it more difficult to bot! 
---
100% agree.
---
But I don't think OP's suggestion makes the game terrible for real players. It definitely improves the lives of roamers. That's easy. For an undisturbed ratter, boating time to pick up the overseer's effects is a slight nerf to isk/hr but not as far as I can tell a change to the experience. The nerf could be adjusted for by tweaking the site's payout numbers. I'm generally in favor of increasing payouts and increasing risk simultaneously, but I don't think OP's suggestions increase risk sufficiently to dramatically increase payouts (since the thing at risk is part of the payout, not your ship or pod). For a ratter who does get disturbed, you potentially lose some time and your current Overseer's Effects bonus rather than just time. This is definitely a significant nerf, which can be offset by work to reduce the amount you get disturbed (by keeping roamers away with gate camps or response ships) or work to minimize the damage when you get disturbed (by more specialized fits that can blitz the overseer, deliberate overspawning that roamers can't tank, etc).
---
I'm especially excited by the idea that this might bring back defensive casual PVP. If your threat model is the occasional interceptor or assault frigate, then having a single RLML Caracal or Osprey Navy in the constellation is probably enough protection so that you're better off not leaving your sites. As a solo-smallgang roamer, I'd rather get fought off by the RLML cruiser (or the hasty squad of them if I'm in a gang) than the current state of warping around and watching everyone dock up.
---
Who even talks like this?
---
..it was that "that" that did it
---
Yeah they'd need to do something drastic like that, and I can't see CCP doing it.
---
Not in the imperium...but you're absolutely frenemies with us relative to the other major powers in the game now.  
---
If push comes to shove and backs are against the wall TEST and IMPERIUM would blue up before they'd blast each other.  Of course, that's entirely PanFam's fault but don't expect them to take any of their well deserved blame.
---
You can't really argue with hypocrites.
---
They scream about how TEST and Imperium are working together, while ignoring that for the 10 previous years NC and PL wondered around the galaxy shitting on anyone who got in their way.
---
As far as I am concerned, NC/PL can eat a dick.
---
Hmm, not a bad idea, but I would implement it differently: if a system is overfarmed then a "anom cost index" goes, which in turn diminishes bounty payouts. Hopefully that wouldn't be insanely hard to implement: calculate the index at downtime and just apply to each bounty payout.
---
This encourages people to spread out ratting more, but doesn't force it: you just have to accept significantly lower payouts in that case.
---
Obviously. Causing your enemies seizures is tactically significant.
---
Renting is part of the player sandbox and I don't see how you could, or why you would want to, ban it. 
---
A full overhaul of the anomaly system may be too much to expect, but there are some easy fixes they can do. One is to add fast, pointing (and webbing?) frigates, so you can't just engage 100MN orbit mode and completely avoid danger. Another is to make rats attack the drones if drones are what's the main threat to them; this means drone boat ratting needs attention (good against both bots and AFK ISK generation).
---
Another is something similar to what you suggest, replacing some or all of the bounty ISK with tags or OPEs; this doesn't really make botting harder (bots can drop an MTU), but it makes risk aversion less efficient (if you warp out, you leave the loot behind) and gives hunters something to shoot for loot (the MTU, or finish a site that is 90% done and get the OPE).
---
This attitude is why you can't win.
---
Industry has its' place, and is necessary.  Your "Elite PVP only" bullshit is what has allowed the Imperium to completely eliminate every advantage you had.
---
I doubt that guy is in PanFam. Most of the people in PanFam I've talked to have been around long enough to know that this is the cycle of Eve. The TAPI/Imperium blue donut will fracture at some point. Snuff will go solo for content. The Chinese will rise. Lots left to happen.
---
I joined Goons just as WWB finished. Delve was an enclave and a precarious refuge. I found it extraordinary that we were just left alone to regroup. If Panfam and friends had pressed their overwhelmingly advantage, Goons would have been hard pressed to survive. Yet, no one came. My personal conclusion is that deals were struck.   How else can that opportunity have been missed? The alternative view is, of course, that the opposition were incompetent and lazy. Who knows. We are where we are now.
---
Well, I keep trying to pitch the idea of a new material needed for "insert something" that can only be farmed from low sec and only in a grid wide cloud of gravitonic radiation (change name to whatever) that prevents all form of capital usage. Boom, more sub-cap warfare and low sec is important.
---
&gt;^For some reason many wormholers that asked for 'removal' of rental empires changed their minds when they acquired vast areas of such space.
---
No. They just bought supers and started to have a lot of fun killing every defenseless capital in sight.
---
Quite the wall of text for something so easy. It's simple, botters = subscriptions. CCP takes action among a very few simply to promote a facade that they care and are doing something about it.
---
daily reminder that it was literally just pl trying to evict test, not even nc hadtheir supers for that. Tri and skillu only came because test was helping xix against them and later harboring them, and even then they weren't crazy to try and take sov off. There was only one relevant entity coming after your space, don't delude yourself.
---
excellent
---
Is it, though? Because it sure looks a lot like 2016 to me. And BoB before that. 
---
Eventually you nerds will pull your heads out of your asses and form a coalition that will beat the shit out of Imperial Legacy. As has happened before and will happen again. But in the mean time I'm going to mock you for all the whining.
---
&gt; Has anyone ever thought about a module that removes you individually from local?
---
We could call it "Improved Cloaking Device II"
---
 "Ratting in my VNI has been awesome, and I've made so much ISK. Recently started Rorqual mining, which has been a blast as well."
---
oi vei
---
That's funny. I spent most of my years in WH space. Literally all of the most exciting battles I remember were C5-C5 cap brawls that would appear out of nowhere. Mind you this was a year or two ago now but I'd be surprised if it were that different now.
---
I prefer goons to NC/PL. Goons are smug krabs, NC/PL will smugly farm you to death for "good fights", then they'll poach your leaderships and your supercap pilots. They smother active groups. Let em eat shit. If all that's left is goons, all the better. More people in shitfit rorqs.
---
Plenty of WH corps don't go into nullsec at all. More do a bit of nullsec roaming, but don't use a nullsec static to do it.
---
Our sigs provide the smaller scale stuff in between Mainfleet deployments. Shout out to Reavers, Space Violence, Liberty Squad, Black Ops, Welp Squad. That is where the pvp'ers go. Ask Deadco what our pvp'er do during offtimes, ask BOT.
---
There are only two ways of winning at eve:
---
1. not logging in
---
2. making your enemy not log in
---
Its not a matter of caring if you lose or not. It is joining with someone you know will backstab you to serve as their meatshield and then get farmed.
---
It just isnt fun. You grind forever and then get farmed to death.
---
Yeah but they are super cancer now.
---
Eve is great!... for extroverts with autism.
---
Most of the Goon pvpers are in SIGS and SQUADS and get tons of pvp.
---
Or during it in snuffs case. #kingsoflowsec
---
I witnessed a good group of players fall victim to this very same thing. Two years ago these guys moved to a region that was ripe with easy pickings. There were so many easy kills to be had you could jump around all day and people would just suicide themselves at your feet.  
---
 I asked these guys "yeah, it's nice when people bring you content isn't it?" They had no idea what I was talking about. I told them not to get used to it. That if they have problems getting kills they need to go roam for kills next.   
---
They didn't want to roam for kills. That would require effort and planning on some small level. People wouldn't be easy pickings because of intel networks and good numbers.   
---
That group is dead now. Most of them actually quit playing Eve Online entirely.
---
Lots of real explorers cherry pick too.
---
Except even if BL, NC, TRI, SkillU and others didn't want to evict us, if we wanted to fight back against PL, we'd have to undock and fight, which means all the aforementioned allliances third-party/dogpile on us anyways because who's going to pass up free gudfites and dunks?
---
I miss NPC shuttles.
---
The real problem is that "optimal" play is the same as bot play, which is the fundamental issue with almost all of Eve's PvE activities.
---
Usually explorers will take at least some risks or interact with you if you chat with them.  But even if they don't, you can't say definitively that they're a bot.  You can get a pretty good idea that they are though, if they're super risk-averse, never speak with you, and react the same way with the same timing every time you see them.
---
The poor old beaten down test meme is bullshit.
---
A player _should_ theoretically be able to make better decisions as to whether to move on or not from a site, judging by what their intel is telling them/if they've seen hostile acitivities, whereas bots will likely be programmed to boat all the way to the wreck -&gt; pick up -&gt; next site. By contrast a player can BM wreck -&gt; next site -&gt; warp back and pick up.
---
As an actual answer, armor buffer fits are generally preferred for big fleet fights and amarr ships usually get the best bonuses for that kind of tanking. So they’re not the “best” per say but in fleet fights they are quite effective.
---
&gt;And from that perspective I've got no respect for this weak ass shit.
---
careful not to cut yourself on that edge
---
hell, its not even been a year since ulax
---
Nobody evicted test from the north, they packed up and left when pl announced they were moving into tribute
---
you may want to recheck the definition of 'insult'.
---
I have been saying for years. NPC space should be in all regions. Now is the perfect time to make the Drone Regions have NPC Triglavian systems.
---
Nice work! 
---
I hope to have something similar when I get my own space soon! Must show off all the Eve stuff! 😍
---
Man...I hate to dogpile but this sounds more like a toddler whining about their sand castle getting kicked over than maybe anything I've ever read on this sub. "We coulda beat them up if we wanted to...." I gotta say it's impressively satisfying given the source.
---
&gt; pretty much every group but panfam has lost a war and made themselves stronger from it
---
Uhmm... Fountain 2010? Seriously, EVE is a flat circle, all of this has happened before and it will all happen again.
---
EVE is dying retard, it's not going to happen again. People are tired.
---
It's a game. You play it to have fun. If you guys have fun being the empire builders and doing the whole Delve thing, more power to you. It's not fun for us, so we don't do it. 
---
Once eve isn't fun, people stop playing. "Elite PVP only" is the playstyle that's fun for people who join groups focused on it. If the game has moved away from that, and it's not viable, then why play? I'll find something else to do.
---
Equally realistically just have CCP change the sign in front of the sec rating of every system.
---
Querious! I remember saving your citadels on multiple occasions
---
&gt; If a person can do it, a bot is going to be able to do it
---
Not if 'it' requires thinking. Bots can easily press buttons but they can't easily make complex decisions. Coincidentally, making complex decisions is also closely linked to what is fun. So making PVE more complex is clearly the right answer.
---
bro stop
---
But did they ever actually betray you, or did they only refuse to be blue and then fight you?  
---
Being removed from your space is annoying and painful if that is all you put value on.  
---
On a line member level there is absolutely no difference between the actions of NCPL and Test, both are going to kill anyone they can and shit post about how bad the enemy is for losing regardless of how unbalanced the fight was.
---
At the leadership level the biggest concern is not letting your alliance die, if your players expect constant fighting then you must find someone you can attack regardless of who they are or how many times you have fought them. Test just happened to be a good target each time NCPL needed to provide their members with content, and as far as I am aware no deals were broken in doing so.
---
Elite PVP isn't an issue.  Goons have Elite PVP SIGs and SQUADs.
---
The issue is your absolute refusal to allow industry to prosper, and be recognized as a real, contributing thing to your alliance.
---
GSF not only protects their industry with their hammer, they also actively applaud the contributions of that industry.
---
Elite PVP has to start with someone mining a rock.
---
Yeah you're still wrong
---
Ok Internet tough guy lol
---
Hi friend
---
&gt; he prospect of slowboating a supercarrier to the center of a rock haven to scoop loot 
---
fc what is mtu
---
&gt;BELO-CHERNO
---
Means "White-Black" in Russian
---
Science victory is for casual scrubs
---
I already have months of training put into drones becouse i like astero and stratios.
---
Is proteus completely useless? I could extract drone skills if its better to go for legion
---
You don't have unlimited accounts though unless you want to give infinite money to CCP. An account which is watching a gate isn't making ISK to plex itself.
---
Snek gets great drone bonuses.
---
&gt;blopsing
---
unless you're the hunter I fail to see any kind of fun to be had there, also go rat for the isk to buy those blops for me.
---
You cannot fix botting through gameplay changes unless you are willing to throw out the entire game and start from scratch.  As has been mentioned multiple times, just putting more tasks in front of a bot will do very little.  Nerfing a ship or "removing local" will just push the bots to another area or a different ship.  Beyond the fact that you are also hurting the current playerbase at the same time and we need more players, not less. 
---
The only real solution is to run better security on CCP site (though heuristics to detect botting behavior or other means - e.g. require 2 factor on all accounts) or to put in place anti-botting software measure (yea like Capcha - i know it can be broken, there are better versions out there). 
---
The problem is that both of these solutions will low the number of players in the game, either because they don't like two factor or they can't log on in the morning and stay logged in all day (see intel / cloacky campers etc.).
---
&gt; When's Eve 2 coming out? 
---
I don't know, but probably before Star Citizen
---
I think there's a bit of a moratorium on talking about bot details on here. As I understand it though the front end part of the client will allow information to be read from it programmatically.
---
Pretty sure they're all just waiting for classic wow at this point.
---
This is EXACTLY why I left SLYCE over a year ago.  
---
It wasn't SLYCE itself, but other members of the coalition were botting.
---
Ranger Regiment basically had ONE bot at the MINIMUM around my home system within a few jumps.  It was impossible to rat without being disturbed by botters, when I said something I was quickly harassed by other coalition leaders.  Never directly from SLYCE leaderhip, but other directors of the coalition.
---
You SP farm the account. I haven't been playing much eve as of late, but I'd assume that farming still at least comes close to net even if not profiting some? Put some implants in and train some skills, it's not like the cloaky scouts ever gonna die.
---
Did you get recruitment scammed?  
---
Is that still a thing?
---
&gt; The poor old beaten down test meme is bullshit.
---
Stating the fact that most of us can't stand PL is not a meme so much as a fact. What would we have to gain from ganging up on Goons again like WWB when there's a contiguous, unbroken arc of hostiles from Detorid all the way up to fucking Tenal that would turn on us the moment we were all done with Goons (assuming we actually pulled it off).
---
Sure kid, whatever you say.
---
And yet I remember alot of sentiment against goons at that time and then a team up with Panfam but you know don't let history lie to you I guess
---
Two questions. First, r/eve tells me that the CSM is entirely run by Goons to give free Icelandic vacations to goons and to make sure the game mechanics are changed in a way that it always benefits Goons. Given this, please tell us how CSM directed CCP to aid Goons and hurt everyone else? 
---
And now a more serious question: has CCP given you any shit about this AMA?
---
Never extract drone skills :s
---
&gt; The play styles of each MBC member were different
---
And so were their victory conditions. Killing goons was just never part of ours.
---
&gt;The issue is your absolute refusal to allow industry to prosper, and be recognized as a real, contributing thing to your alliance
---
Ahh yes the classic "We know all about how PL functions". Who's your PL alt since you know so much about our alliance and our opinions of industry?
---
Nah fuck that, I would rather see panfam be farmed to shit!
---
If I told you that, I wouldn't have a PL alt anymore :)
---
You guys love to darkly intimate that we should help you or we will be next!  You know what?  I dont give a fuck.  So long as the north is well and truly destroyed first, I'm happy with coming in second in the final eve score.
---
Simply put, goons are a better ally and far more trustworthy than the north ever were.  If we helped you the last shell casing wouldn't even hit the ground before you would be trying to put the knife in our back.
---
But you cowards keep pissing yourselves before the shooting even starts, that's great for morale I'd imagine.
---
Ah yes the dismissing, how dare history get in your way.
---
High five guys, we won eve. Do we get a trophy or something?
---
what is super krabbing? (asking for a friend)
---
Ahh the weekly "eve is dying" post
---
Man I hate those botchers
---
Eve has 22k plus player concurrently on a server how is eve dying?
---
I realized that these player corps demonstrated perfectly Adam Smith’s man of systems.
---
Me too.
---
I don't know man, it's in a rather sorry state at the moment!  If it's not dying, it's definitely suffering
---
PVP skill is irrelevant when you can drop 500 titans that can be replaced
---
I get the impression that if they'd remained friendly to and blued the number of people they'd need to in order to contest this, it would have severely hampered the kind of gameplay their members enjoy. And if you don't enjoy playing the game then contesting anything is pointless anyway. So yea they're responsible for this situation but I don't see a future where this played out any other way.
---
Interesting response. Involve pun about growing and having a sex life vs some random internet guy.
---
Still means nothing in context : I undock, you don't. End of story.
---
Oh and great comparis kills of a 2009 char to a 2015 one. Do you need a hug ?
---
Add a elite frigate npc that roams the constellation and tries to tackle those who have negative standings with their group, make it so that players with positive standings can take advantage of that, or make it so that the npc can help the things that the site spawn shoot the bot, and be dealt by a player paying atention (deploy light drones blap)
---
Along with over 90% of Eve players.
---
No, however, it did lock in assets, and most systems did not have a station so if you wanted to stage ratting ships in a system you had a POS - and blowing up POSes *does* drop assets.
---
/woosh
---
thx OP, i enjoy reading your insight
---
Why would they asset safety Titans? Especially when they can helicopter dick them onto any invading force? No, you will have to destroy the titans to have a chance at killing even 1 Keepstar, much less 30+.
---
pretty bad numbers compared to even 2-3 years ago, plus most of those are alts, plus the game is supposed to be f2p now and numbers have only gotten worse
---
Not worth extracting. 
---
The Proteus will get the job done, but yeh you'dbe better off training into the Legion, Loki or Tengu.
---
You could code the bot to ignore the bot-stopper rat. It could detect it if say, after 5 minutes of shooting the thing still isn't dead, then ignore it.
---
you're not the center of the universe, unless you decide to do some mightily retarded plays nobody is gonna get in range to help pl kill your sov defense fleet. Especially when they can't jump in because you can use these mystical things called cyno jammers.
---
btw do you still think 1t is an amount just ~2 alliances can have on the wallet or that it takes 2 months for people to replace 9 titans? :&gt;
---
Can I pre-order about 8,000 of these to scatter around Jita and Perimeter?
---
If eve is going so strong why is CCP shrinking and selling off their company? 🤔🤔🤔
---
To be fair, when I'm exploring I'll instawarp the hell away as soon as anyone pops up on my Dscan unless I'm in HS. Apparently killing some shit Imicus is a lot of fun to people so not gonna take that risk if I can avoid it.
---
About what? Winning in the end?
---
More NPC owned stations within jump range of lowsec would help so much. It would vastly change up which regions are easy and hard to defend and would let small groups start out in 0.0 without having to become renters.
---
If you could cash out on badposts this one would make you rich
---
ok retard
---
hmm. That seems somewhat reasonable. I'm having to remind myself how I put it together, as it was years ago, but it should be doable without too much work.
---
Ever played Star Citizen?
---
Even the Mittani knows EVE is dying that's why he's been in contact with the Saudis and the Chinese trying to pawn off his pathetic virtual empire onto gullible foreigners that don't know the game is doomed
---
One can only hope.
---
Let's be real here. Goons will kill a keepstar in a TIDI shitfest, maybe get a couple of titan kills, declare victory and then go home after 2 weeks.
---
Bots are already scripted to watch for Commander spawns and loot said wrecks. They then have a trigger for dumping their cargo at a specified % full amount. Change that amount to 1% or something and at best they lose a single sites worth of loot, aka 30m.
---
This proposal simply indicates the bots would return and dump after each site or a randomized number of sites that the operator is comfortable with losing. Sure, the repetitive nature of this could become more visible to the security group, but it would likely yet again mimic human input as I sure as hell would not cruze around with 6hrs worth of isk.
---
Honestly I wouldn't mind this if the item value is a little more of an increase then what they take out, little more reward for the extra risk, it would benefit pirates, ratters and gankers in the whole loop of things
---
Lorne sausage is great :) Part of a full Scottish breakfast, along with black pudding, fruit pudding and haggis. :D (and a few other things)
---
I'll see if I can make it. (The meet. Not the breakfast. Though maybe that too.)
---
structures
---
&gt;Ahh the ~~weekly~~ ~~daily~~ hourly "eve is dying" post
---
I support hiding that information. I assume you have it and can supply it if CCP asks, but I don't see any reason to encourage brigading by providing us with that feedback.
---
As a hi-sec mission runner and ratter; I like this thought. Give me a reason to move around space (even if I want to stay in empire space) and work for different clients other than LP and standing balances.
---
&gt; if you don't have the most supercaps in-theater you don't have any supercaps
---
That in a nutshell is the problem with the current state of nullsec (and lowsec). Well, both that and the fact that it's so easy to deploy capitals and supers to a different theatre, so you can't feint and split your opponent's force to prevent them bringing it to a fight.
---
Ok my time frame is wrong. Sorry. If we count pre athanors all t2 stuff has gone up. Cerbs are what 250 now? They use to be 200 if not less.
---
We can argue over yes or no inflation all day we only have data from a year ago and that is by no means enough time to really measure if there is or not. 
---
PI should be going up due to demand but there are a lot of producers so it keeps it steady. Same reason why t1 isnt inflated. Rorquals.
---
And if we argue with t2 frigs the inflation is even more so. They use to be 20m avg on the high end. Now easy 25-30m
---
We can agree inflation doesn't effect everything but its there none the less.
---
As for extractors that does throw a wrench into the plex is inflated because isk. But if sp farms aren't profitable anymore then they should go away and plex SHOULD normalize.. That being said as long as extractors are so expensive plex will be to because they are directly linked. 4 injectors will always equal a plex minus 4 extractors.
---
I see the small stuff going up tho t2 mods t2 frigs. Hell even PI has gone up just not asuch as I would have expected with the new structures.
---
My point here is it dosent matter if we see it or not its happening. As long as more isk is coming into the game inflation will be a thing. That being said some inflation is fine but I dont think were at a sustainable level of inflation atm and if the new invasion adds even more isk faucets then CCP really dosent know what their doing
---
They suggestion was more aimed at the "anomalies would need reworking" comment.
---
Good god, I thought people were wrong about how boring E:D is. Then I played it.
---
It's about as fun as *actual* ED.
---
Eve has more players than most online games.
---
Overly aggressive dudebros named Kyle hopped up on Monster energy drinks.
---
But the bots can read the overview... They can bookmark wrecks too... It wouldn't take long to make the bots smart enough, and they'll still out perform humans simply because the effort vs payout equation is so heavily in their favour
---
\+1 insightful.  If none of us log in, we've all won?
---
Extroversion and autism don't often coincide IME.
---
most online games don't need as many players to be fun
---
I have been playing Eve Online since 2007. In all that time I have been part of many wars and have watched many wars from the sidelines. Most people that play eve have no clue about all the subtle nuances of war in this fantastic game we all play. Most people are completely ignorant of the history in Eve Online. That isn't necessarily their fault though. Many people that play the game now are new players because most of the older players like myself have "moved on" to other games or just quit entirely. As a result history does tend to repeat itself in Eve Online much like it does in real life. The Egos of large alliance leaders does come into play as well with how wars play out. Some leaders are completely reckless with no regard for the time and effort committed by their member base while other leaders are far more aware of how their actions can impact the health of their member base and opt to adopt long term strategies over short term ones.   
---
If you ask me I think there are many variables to account for in this coming conflict. I have been watching things unfold over the last few years. If I was to place money on whom I would consider the winner in this next war. I would put my money on the Imperium short term. If the Imperium decides to burn all of PanFam sov, that will take months like it always does. In fact, now it should take far longer due to the proliferation of citadels. In the past groups that were being invaded had the option of just redeploying some where else to take sov far enough away from the original conflict to dissuade their enemies from following them to the new conflict. Most groups in the past did not bother with the chase. If Imperium does seem to uproot PanFam from their sov, forcing them to move their assests, the Imperium should carefully consider devoting part of their invasion effort to hunting them down while they grind all that sov in the north.   
---
Long term ... I have no idea. Too many factors to take into account. These coalitions have been fighting each other for more than a decade. Do you have any idea how many times they have been at war against each other? They are both still around despite losing to each other time and time again.
---
&gt; Well, I keep trying to pitch the idea of a new material needed for "insert something" that can only be farmed from low sec and only in a grid wide cloud of gravitonic radiation (change name to whatever) that prevents all form of capital usage. Boom, more sub-cap warfare and low sec is important.
---
I would love to see this. Lowsec needs to be a place where mid-sized alliances can grow without being smothered into oblivion the moment even small-to-mid sized super fleet moves into the area for 'content'.
---
OMFG! You best be knocking on the nearest piece of wood you can find bro. It could end up just like that.
---
Or you know, just nerf Titans/Supers into the ground.
---
It's almost like removing outposts and poses in favor of citadels was a horrible idea
---
You're retarded and forgetting that sov defense fleets tend to incorporate a mix of heavier doctrines and harassment doctrines, and that 99% of fleet comps that contest citadels are heavy doctrines.
---
Oh sure. Even in it's janky unconnected state it's more fun than ED.
---
Oh yeah, I'm sure Goonswarm has solid SIGs.  I'm fully aware that Imperium does a lot more than just krabbing.   
---
I'm just arguing that winning the Titan game doesn't mean they've "Won EVE" in every sense of the word.
---
I like this idea of checking in with a CONCORD station to claim bounties. Gives a nice visual of your capsuleer throwing a data-slate on a bureaucrats desk, "Pay me." Elite Dangerous has this system of needing to check in with a station to claim bounty rewards.
---
Eve doesn't need many players to be fun
---
Large scale fights are the most boring thing you can do in eve, its literally just pressing f1.
---
Im 10% tidi vni ratting would take more attention
---
Congrats, this is officially the dumbest thing I've read all month. And you're competing with Trump's twitter feed.
---
Which is stupid unless you’re doing it in a hostile region to troll the enemy.  Otherwise, it’s just behavior that, in aggregate, sabotages the income of your alliance.
---
Or overly repressed neckbeards in failing marriages *pretending* to be a hopped-up dudebro named Kyle.
---
Limiting where you can anchor ESS is easy. Its been restricted in the past. Force it to be anchored in a fair location and defended, then make it a significant portion of the bounty payout. Maybe make it take a bit longer to loot the ESS, and boost the payouts and LP rewards
---
Active ratters should be able to easily defend, but inactives, botters, etc should be easily bullied. 
---
This is on par with rorq PANIC.
---
they dont have to be all grouped together retard more players  = more content even if they're all spread out. wouldn't expect a hurr durr init monkey to get something so basic though.
---
Lasers get good dps they can can range at a drop of the hat can literally survive on one set of t1 ammo for months have some of the tankiest ships going get ships with cap warfare bonuses armor gangs don't want Gal logi they want guardians and apostles glorious golden or pure white hulls or go full emo and decorate them with the blood of slaves.
---
The first race lore wise that wasn't jovian to enter space age zealotry is so rife they named a hac after it so it's easy to jump into rp as a amarrian they have the space pope on their side.
---
Why would anyone consider any other race?
---
something that can't tractor faster than a super can blow things up, and will have to be collected later, either by a second toon (which in that case, just have the second toon grab the thing) or left behind and collected later (which I don't hate, but will discourage people from ratting if the meta becomes people probing down and stealing those, hence, my fear that it will push bots into barges)
---
Replace all rats in Eve with Diamond rats. Put all the site value, except salvage and random loot drops, into relatively large OPE.
---
Redo the ESS so that it is mandatory (or put the same functions on the ihub). Make it take 90-100% of the bounties. Make it so that sharing or looting it is the same - must stay on grid for a minute and be able to collect the tags. Now you have something that can generate fights and hurts easily bottable AFK gameplay.
---
No one wins in the blue donut. There is only stagnation, failure and meh.
---
Your blog was pretty good tbh fam.
---
Have you ever thought about becoming a bitter vet and living in a wormhole?
---
It’s honestly the life.
---
How would content pn the other side of the map mran anything to me
---
Also hurr durr test retard complaining about grouping up, literlally the 2. Largest alliance
---
Disagree.
---
Hey :)
---
Hope you are good! Did you manage to get the map generation off the coalition API working?
---
I got this weird spawn twice in a row, thought it was maybe something to do with my session so I relogged and haven't had it since.
---
Survived it both times in an AB Vagabond though, and MTU'd the loot.
---
To address your points in no particular order:
---
We have no particular love for the smug elite culture of NCPL.  They waved a super hammer across New Eden for a good decade where they could cyno across the entire thing within an hour and now they're crying about titan proliferation.  They repeatedly farmed entities that were much easier pickings like BRAVE and TEST for years.  The moment WWB was over, we were evicted by them so that they could install renters.
---
To compare, earlier iterations of BL punched above their weight and made it their mission to try to fight stronger entities, NCPL always seemed to go for the easy road.
---
&gt; At the leadership level the biggest concern is not letting your alliance die, if your players expect constant fighting then you must find someone you can attack regardless of who they are or how many times you have fought them.
---
Agreed, and we've deployed to fight GotG and Horde but we never had any intentions of evicting them. Goons have deployed sigs on our borders since we moved South but I don't recall Kendarr ever being an insufferable elitist about it.
---
&gt;the backbone of the Imperium... which is a crazy, autistic group of  people who don't care about good fights or structure grinds, just empire  building and completing objective, you can't really kill them off. 
---
The real Eve killer right here.
---
what do i care what means anything to you. i was talking about the game brainlet. god damn you are so dumb.
---
Living under a pax imperia may be ok IRL (depending on whether you feel represented etc), but it's pretty boring in a game, and CCP should be adjusting the game mechanics to encourage guerilla warfare and non-blob fun.
---
What are some ways then?
---
There is *one* reason that happened, and that was because we were getting paid way, *way* more than we were worth. We were getting paid almost twice our Wicked Creek monthly income *per week* to join that war and we had our payment doubled partway through.
---
Source: I'm Durr, I was TEST 2IC for four years through all of this shit you're trying to tell me I'm wrong about you dumbfuck.
---
The game would be fine even if there only was content on some parts of it
---
The primary game that I play which is planetside 2 only have 2-3k players I wish we had more.
---
If TRC is PL alts then where did I leave my PL main? Need help finding it I guess since I didn't even know I had one.   
---
O.O
---
INIT did win wormholes scrub.  
---
When the mere threat of invasion gets people unanchoring structures you're winning.
---
If you wanna get kinda creative, the 100mn AB HAM Legion is a popular PvP build. And that subsystem allows for a few drones. But it defeats the purpose of saving space with lasers, if you have to cart around piles of missiles.
---
Proteus is okay. It's just not anybodys  favorite. It's typically used as a shiny Deimos, rather than a shiny Ishtar.
---
And he didn't even mention the group that actually paid for the whole Sotiyo.   
---
Don't whether to be happy or sad that we are under the radar that much.
---
You don't count.
---
Or whiny pubescent children seeking validation *pretending* to be overly repressed neckbeards in failing marriages *pretending* to be a hopped-up dudebro named Kyle.
---
They are all coming here "fresh" so they need to build up assets and even SPs before they really can do anything.
---
This is, IMO, one of the big ironies of EVE: groups will make peace because it is in their strategic interest to do so, even in a game where the primary entertainment is not being at peace.
---
&gt; I agree with the sentiment. If any bloc was ever closer to total Eve domination, it's today's Imperium. 
---
So you were around when BOB/MC was big?
---
I don't think so.
---
The lore helps implement new features. New sand in the box to play with and build bigger castles. Think about it: who are the most famous characters in Eve? Players. It's not like in WoW where we're just faceless players of one side or another. Andrew Groen recognized this and wrote a book with a better story than any lore for a game I've ever read.
---
Badfellas were renters as well, they just rented at a reduced rate as they were the "militia." This was also before the moon mining changes and I remember the good moons in the systems we rented having either a PL or NC. POS claiming the moon goo which really bugged me at the time. 
---
Some of Badfellas were awesome but in the end, they were still renters with a pvp pretense.
---
you are so unfunny
---
&gt; How do you get the hunter in other than logging on/off? 
---
you jump in via gate
---
&gt;You'd just stop ratting in that system for a sufficiently long time, and you could even track where the blops are based on where you've lost a vni recently.
---
it's like you forget jumping around is dirt cheap, and a blops decloaking/cloaking is viewed the same on dscan as jumping out.
---
&gt;I've done a lot of blops, and let me tell you how fucking boring it is dropping on VNIs.
---
you don't drop on them, you bridge a guy into the system, jump your cyno out, and then wait a little bit as people rat
---
the issue is that the defender CAN'T know when you're in system period, there is no way of knowing.
---
&gt;I just don't think it's enough and more focus should be put on creating a tool that can track transfer of isk.
---
botting can't be solved, 10 inputs per hour isn't enough to track bot usage
---
the only bots that get banned are the ones that run 16+ hrs a day
---
I think we need more k-space.
---
Alright, I'm getting wooshed here. Is this satire?
---
ty, I didnt know wh tracker
---
who ever happens to be the biggest at any point in time is the 'victor'
---
Thanks for this AMA and the insight you're providing us into how decisions are made that affect Eve as a whole.
---
If you're willing to continue this discussion, I would point out that any fix which uses a "number of ships" or "jumped mass" approach simply scales up the number of cynos used. Example: noobship cyno lights, brick battleship comes through a bridge and lights, fax comes through and lights, titans and more faxes come through, whole fleet comes through.
---
I can see this happening and not taking more than a minute for the whole shebang. It slows things down slightly but in my humble non-expert opinion a determined, prepared force won't be stopped by that type of change.
---
Okay...
---
...do you have any evidence for this?
---
&gt; But if sp farms aren't profitable anymore then they should go away and plex SHOULD normalize..
---
This is the problem SP farming has not been profitable for a couple of years but most people can extract the 200 mill per toon that is needed to make them profitable the utility of alts makes it often worth it at a slight loss, so i don't see the SP farms stop pushing plex up given there is almost no price where injectors are no longer worth getting.
---
edit: 
---
As for inflation not inflation, it's a complex problem and i feel inflation is often throw around as a easy solution when there are so many factors that are currently harming the economy ( i do agree less isk printing isn't a bad thing ).
---
What? Goons, in Eve and in every other game I've seen them in, always care about winning, and usually are happy to do unfun things in the pursuit of that victory.
---
thank you, rich chigga 19
---
that will be all now
---
When DHD tells you you are wrong, put the shovel down...
---
jesus christ you're dense, don't even bother responding anymore after this one. Citadels are irrelevant, do you think anyone but pl nerds were forming to kill tapi citadel #328? you know you can anchor as many as you like for as low as 800m a pop and even set them to the same time right? 
---
also there is no "heavier" doctrine that would even come close to entice the other entities to move and drop you on a consistent basis, let alone if its jammed to any degree. You need to look no further on how long it took nc supers to get into ualx.
---
yep, so much this  
---
lowsec was collateral damage
---
As I said before, MBC consisted of a bunch of groups who preferred PvP - I believe if MBC had went South to finish the job, Goons would have lost more members (like what happened with CO2), MBC would have still broken up, and there would be a lot more smaller alliances populating the map instead of the North vs. South blobs we have now.
---
Yeah absolutely. There's lots of things you can do to make blobbing less efficient, or deployment of blobs slower, harder and more expensive, or hunting in the 'fields' of your economic opponent easier and more rewarding.
---
This is kinda like saying China has won Earth... Yea it's true, but it doesn't really change how I play the game, and you never know, some day they might elect Trump, and it might change everything
---
Yep. I have a record of who voted for what. (so I can restrict characters to a single vote, and let people change their voting) 
---
So I can do a degree of analytics if it's relevant. Like by alliance membership or whatever. (only at the time of analysis though. Not recording membership, so that'd be a lookup)
---
Yup. That's real life. This is a game. It's OK to take risks. But apparently a lot of folks here seem to disagree with that.
---
Yeah I know who you are it was in your tag you dumbass.  But if you hated them so much even despite the money maybe you shoulda reconsidered teaming up with them.  So yeah you're still fucking wrong.  Even as one of the leaders I do remember you were always abit of a dull bulb.
---
Is 'Red Shirt Bad' not enough evidence?
---
WWB was funded by betting ISK, no longer available, and was before the game got pushed even further into the defender-advantage and capital umbrella territory by citadels.
---
You should be happy and stop fishing for attention :V
---
See: wormholes
---
See: POS
---
&gt; Another common one suggestion is to have more incoming ships require more LO the way Jump Bridges work.
---
quick what's the highest EHP you can get on a deep space transport? or even better cyno in a rorq and then hit the PANIC button after your fleet comes through.
---
I just bought one and got it yesterday. 34" 3440x1440p. I tried playing by dragging two clients side by side and it worked great. I use eve-o preview as well for more than two clients.
---
When DHD tells you you're wrong typically hes the one thats wrong...you should've learned that by now.
---
&gt;Add a "home station" citadel service which is required in order to respawn in that citadel. Allow it to be installed and function in wormholes.
---
Yeah let's not.
---
They can't take responsibility for their own actions... even more then that, they can't see why TEST could possibly be bluetrals with goons.
---
Goons and TEST have had fights, but at least goons honor their word, and generally act in good faith.
---
They don't finish a war, and then immediately target the people who helped them to install renters.
---
by that measure, CVA is TEST
---
Isn't it almost 50 now?
---
While eve is easy to bot from a mechanical standpoint, making it harder may not necessarily solve the problem. In games like Runescape, people have created very complex bots to do the more complex end game content. Essentially, making eve harder will only lead to more complicated bots.
---
&gt; But if you hated them so much even despite the money maybe you shoulda reconsidered teaming up with them. So yeah you're still fucking wrong.
---
It seems to have worked out pretty well for us.
---
Is it just me or has StainGuys posting gone drastically downhill?
---
It started with just shitty posts about low sec gates to some forgotten region, now it seems like every comment gets worse.
---
Why bother with the ADM modifier aspect of this? They're already arbitrarily nerfing spawn rates, just keep nerfing...
---
💯
---
The complete and utter destruction of PL/NC on the diplomatic front is probably their second biggest mistake.
---
They ally with people, and then turn around before the blood is dry on the last war and kill their friends.
---
Remember Nulli Secunda? Test?... Staunch allies, until they weren't and PL decided to big dick them.
---
Now another group is wearing the strap on, so PL has to pretend like they are the victims, when all along they were the villains, and somehow goons are the good guys.
---
Strange time to be alive.
---
No I really only became unprofitable in the last 3 to 6 months I know cuz I used to farm my 5 alts 
---
And injector prices are relative to your wallet I will never inject from the market my toons have to much SP its straight up not worth for me. But im also not a trillionaire where it matters wayyy less.
---
To be clear I see your point that not just inflation has caused plex prices but I didnt mean to imply that was the only reason lol. Just a big one.
---
Something something shifting goalposts...
---
Autopilot landing 15 away is to give risk. If you are trying to say inactive gameplay has no place in eve you’re in the wrong game. The skill grind is put off to inactivity. You can queue up a year of skills leave and come back to the character fully trained. 
---
AFK VNI carries risk in that if you aren’t hitting and aren’t abusing an intel tool that pings you when someone is two jumps out then you will lose the VNI.
---
Certainly not at the time, and what I said was still the truth during that time period.  In fact you were pretty mad which you keep saying about them betraying you again.
---
Whats it like having all that extra real estate?
---
If it's that pathetic, why post about it?
---
Vaportrail memefleet
---
hehe guess it was better to "hoover" up every mouth breathing player with a titan/super... cool kids..
---
&gt; Certainly not at the time
---
It went well for us at the time too.
---
Rorqual mining is pretty good because it's much more risky to bot.  It gives a significant static objective that sits around for hours at a time, but only at times that the defenders are available.
---
Well that's just not true and you know that.
---
It's like having two monitors without a border.
---
I'm more saying inflation is far from the big problem in the economy right now. 
---
Plex prices themselves are not really an issue, honestly the biggest problem is see right now is the amount of minerals that are flooding around, to the point that the most valueable thing right now is industry slots ( spoiler losing a couple 100 mil on toons for the industry slots is total worth it ).
---
I no longer have a regret that I never went here before I beat the game.
---
Any activity that's so easily bottable is inherently really fucking boring for humans to do. Making activities more varied and engaging makes them both more fun and less bottable.
---
Unfortunately, you’d have been better off if it had been.
---
nbz ded confirmed.
---
 
---
I play on r/eve exclusively until I get the AT back.
---
None of this is really new.  Everyone but CCP has known that the lack of NPC space in far flung regions is a problem at least as far back as 2014.  And CCP was made aware of the problem and solution back then by every major sov null leader and most of the CSM.
---
Since the original TMC page is gone here's a mirror to the original open letter to CCP signed by almost everyone that mattered at the time.
---
http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?17867-The-Null-Deal-A-Statement-from-Sovereign-0-0
---
Sounds good to me
---
What part of it didn't work well? The part where the war literally bankrolled us into funding our following war against NCPL when they evicted CO2 *and* the war after that where we left and invaded the south, forcing goons out of that war and taking that space without missing a beat? That contract funded *two* major wars for us and gave us the resources to become what we are now. If we hadn't taken it we'd have probably stagnated as a middling power in Wicked Creek until someone decided to evict us there.
---
While what you say is true you can't deny that the economy in eve is fundamentaly broken with how fast you can get new titans. Isn't it kind of ridiculous that it takes nearly no time to get another on of the biggest ships in the game? Shouldn't it take weeks or even months to gather the minerals for a titan and then the time to build it?
---
Yeah it's weird. We had over 30 people at fanfest at one point, there we're only about 120 odd in corp including alts. Helluva crew and I miss them dearly.
---
I'm sure that kind of stuff still happens (nullbear here so I haven't experienced it), each group plays their way.  NS whaling is great content for holers because of the proliferation of Rorquals and Super Ratting, so many of the larger groups have taken up this pastime.
---
The whole idea of space that isn't rented out (or tithes of some kind being paid), and small alliances making there own way "fighting the man" so to speak is just a Romantic dream really.
---
You'd be playing a different game entirely if it ever could be realized. The one we have right now, you can technically do but it just isn't any fun identifying that way.
---
from what i hear most people in gsf isnt laughing because ncpl decided to unanchor and move, they are laughing that all it took was a declaration that we would deploy somewhere next weekend
---
The part where you tried to setup in the north and after WWB and got kicked out.
---
well done!
---
even if it's never its going to be before star citizen 😁
---
We *did* get set up there successfully and chilled for more than half a year before getting into a war that we successfully extracted from and moved on to become even stronger. We ultimately made probably 3000-4000% more money than if we had stayed in the south, war/eviction/following war in the south included, and we were filling full fleets at the end of WWB compared to 90-140 in the south prior. Where's the bad outcome here?
---
Can you add a "no input" middle ground between the upvote and downvote? I'm using "Things I haven't voted on" to find ideas that I haven't looked at yet, but I'd love to be able to hide stuff that I've seen but have no opinion on in that view. (For example: I have zero experience with and zero interest in faction warfare, so I'd like to "no input" vote all of those things to hide them rather than up- or down-voting. I could use coinflips to simulate neutral-voting, but it sounds like you're potentially looking at quantity of votes as well as their distribution so it'd be nice to be able to make a definite non-interest "vote".)
---
I run 3 24" monitors and i absoloutly love it.
---
TTP: infinitesimal
---
"Successfully Extracted" from is certainly a nice spin isn't it?
---
DELETE THIS
---
The low resolution is super noticeable if you run more than 1 monitor too.
---
Who's gonna identify the system first?
---
You mean the part where we left after CO2 got invaded but before we did, sold most of our in-place assets for a decent price and used it to bankroll a war where we took space that was way, way, way, *way* more valuable than Vale?
---
Yeah, I'd say that was pretty successful.
---
I can't click on that because I saw "winds of change" and got that bloody whistling from the Scorpions track stuck in my head. Thanks for that.
---
WHAT WAS, WILL BE; WHAT WILL BE, WAS
---
Oh Lawdy, I'm going to unironically  bring up the Fabian strategy. 
---
Yes, Goons knew exactly what they were doing when they kept blueballing MBC. That, in my opinion, is one of the key differences between TEST and the other MBC members - we have no problem watching an enemy die a slow death, and would have waited for more and more Goon corps to leave (like CO2 did) until there were too few members left to rebuild. PL and friends weren't willing to wait for more content, which is why they didn't pursue and instead started going after the closest non-blue ships they could find once MBC dissolved.
---
Would it have meant that MBC needed to remain unified for a while longer? Yes. Would it have meant less content in the immediate future? You bet. Would it have been effective in putting the final nail in the WWB coffin? Absolutely.
---
Are you still doing this? How's it going? This post inspired me to play this game and I'm just now starting FW.
---
As if there is no HS gate camp or Jita camp. As if there is no insta locker.
---
Your autopilot don't do MWD cloak trick. You can let autopilot go through low sec and take your own risk doing that. You're just ignoring risk for lazy player constantly semi-afk hitting jump button which is almost like VNI null carebear ratting.
---
&gt; New local delayed covert tackler ship class. 0 recalibration. But 0 damage
---
&gt; Either 60 seconds delayed, can probe and light a covert cyno as a blops scout. Or 2.5 min delayed, is fast/agile/tankier as a +1 scout.
---
&gt; Introduce this ship, suddenly watch subcap anom bots becoming an asset to this game, as they are a source of content now.
---
so it's only delayed local for the bots somehow, or do real players just get to eat shit as well?
---
it's not just locking targets -- when you're sentry ratting you have to kill rats in order. shoot the small ones while they're still approaching you because once they start orbiting your sentries can't track them. sentries need to be actively managed.
---
that's why I was surprised that a bot would use them. not because a bot *can't* do these things, they can bot carriers after all. but a domi seems low-reward for raising your risk profile like that. I'm disappointed that the risk profile is so low that is doesn't matter to them.
---
Missing ' Internet Spaceships are serious buisness '. Just saying. Nice shrine btw. :)
---
Ah, but you are making the mistake of thinking that most people in those groups cared about more then short to mid-term content.
---
Most of the people who were going to drop out of goons, left when they lost in the north.  I won't lie, one of the best times to be in GSF was right after all of the fairweather friends left.  There was this renewed sense of community, you knew that the guys who were still there had your back and weren't going anywhere.
---
I don't think you could have finished GSF off.  You could have spent months camping them in NPC delve, and they would have been off playing PS2 or something.
---
The only thing INIT wins is how fast they can lick mittens bunghole
---
PL poked us plenty even after we moved south.  Wasn't till the latter part of 2017 that we proved we could hold our own in regular dread brawls.  In march of 2018 i think it was we proved our supers and caps could withstand the best punch panfam+allies could lay at us with regular caps+subcaps.  then summer of 2018, PL lost providence fast, but later made progress in Immensea with allies up till UALX (we lost 2 total keepstars that war, one in immensea one in UALX), and with the PL supers trapped - goons pushed hard and won the X47 armor timer without PL present in major super numbers.  Post X47 keepstar dying, we saw the GoTG and Panfam fallout, with the eastern/winter coalition coming apart in cooperation and Tri getting whacked on a move op.
---
i think you got the year wrong, you meant fall of 2019
---
Yup like that. The resolution that is auto set for the client was something like 1734x1440. Was a little weird at first but I just resized the UI boxes.
---
I for one would love to roam and harass PvE players more if the nearly finished sites could earn me a quick buck. It would also force home defense as it is a lot of income lost otherwise.
---
Here's something - maybe, because those real people get annoyed by it...they fight back? And you get content? And the game is a healthier place because people actually play the game instead of watching netflix?
---
If only there was some other part of Eve that wasn't over run by bots that this "remove local" thing could be tested at.
---
I'm throwing in an evil idea here: make whitelist alt and make them anchor bubbles. Since bubble doesn't count as aggro, their bot get trapped without noticing. Bubble position is then sent to hunters to do their proper job without needing log-off nd wait which is taking stupid amount of effort and the bots could've make the ISK they invested back during the time.
---
Thank you, sir!
---
o7
---
So you're saying that Panfam wasnt coming for you next then essentially forcing you out?
---
I’m going to have to look into that.

I would have some of that beer, thanks :P

Quick google/youtube search. I wouldn't say i have expertise in any one and i havent played for years. Say hello to Mining Bot:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obECg2eViKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obECg2eViKE)
---
So, you see this fella is a 1.0 bot. It runs through progressive checks until it finds a condition and then activates a particular command in order to nonstop mine. I imagine if it was in low/null, it would have checks designed to observe chat. What do they do? Well they mine nonstop and can range from selling the ores outright, providing the ores to a user (or bot) to refine and sell or most likely to pass on to a manufacturing character to make things from it. As you might imagine; Manufacturer making 100s of items/ships without ever taking from the market, but injecting their ships into the market creates economic problems. When people talk about bots; generally they talk about mining bots i think. They appear to be the most widespread and have greatly reduced market prices to the point where mining is not a viable human role anymore. There is simply no time vs reward for it, not to mention it's boring. So, nobody wants to do it - but bots do. They become a 'nessicary evil' (some might argue) wherein if all mining bots are banished and can never return - mining suddenly becomes a highly desired role once stockpiles begin to deplete.
---
re; Nullsec. The millisecond someone enters local and they detect it, all bots align/warp to a safe spot. Best way to deal with them is internal affairs from the alliance/corp. Gank them til they don't have enough money to replace them.
---
At one point (maybe still is?), I was told about botting being a real life job not unlike gold mining in other games. Though i'm skeptical.
---
Market Bot: 
---
I assume this fella automatically updates/changes/lists products without human intervention, using data or conditions. But honestly i know nothing beyond the concept of automating sales. 
---
Mission Bots:
---
Essentially the same as ratting/mining bots, but usually a omni-tank ship that can just go and grind missions 24/7, even if its not hour/isk efficient. It can do it more than you can, so who cares if it takes a while to do each one? It doesn't get bored. And as Mining Bot as prooven; it wouldn't be difficult to tell it to target and shoot (basically the same as target and mine). Activating other things like boosters/invulns is just another parameter to check.
---
Your idea: 
---
As soon as they 'patch' the bots to act accordingly, it wont hinder them. They will complete the site, take the loot, sell/refine/transfer it all as they normally do and continue. The only way to deal with nullsec bots of any kind is to have internal affairs of the alliance do it themselves, but then what's the benefit? They're ruining their own killboard and making it harder for their own alliance to manufacture. There needs to be an insentive, right?
---
So what if the bounty system was automatic? Cumulative ratting/anoms/etc build up an isk value that accretes over time. You'll recognize botters because they'll have huge bounties painted on their backs from non-stop work. Taking breaks will allow it to deflate. My only concern about this very idea, is that a bounty bot will be born to harvest their own bots when they approach a threshold of being above the value of their ship. Not sure there's a meta way to deal with it outside of bans.

So what is your question exactly?
---
Revenge fleet? Sounds like a name you can use for a stellaris fleet.
---
* Line of sight firing requirements that prohibit shots through obstacles or allies
---
* Friendly fire and splash damage, piercing damage, and chain damage effects
---
* Creation of tight physical battlefield chokepoints that limit forces beyond a certain size
---
* Increased "spike-iness" of all damage and repairs that make large force strikes hugely inefficient
---
* Depleting resources that force moving and spreading out, decreasing localized power
---
* Fog of war and imperfect information that aid guerilla tactics and large-scale data collection
---
* Increased permanent asset loss and theft mechanics that can punish rich players
---
* Directional targeting with non-locked hitscan firing (missed shots continue and hit targets behind the original target)
---
* Social and physical stealth mechanics that obscure identity, location, and motivation
---
* Structure sabotage, siphon, hacking, and theft mechanics that punish structure overreach
---
* Pretty much anything that decreases instantaneous force projection (teleportation)
---
* Greater single-unit autonomy, allowing individual actors to accomplish more when outnumbered
---
* Decreased safety of large-scale deployment bases, preventing content-denial tactics
---
We had Wrecking Ball Supremacy
---
We had Supers Supremacy 
---
We have Titan supremacy. 
---
They will eventually nerf Titans enough to bring a new meta because we would have never moved out of the Wrecking Ball phase had CCP not massively changed carriers.
---
Suck my cock
---
N+1 will still be king
---
I agree. Only aggressive enforcement and automated detection can make a real difference.
---
Just be prepared to die a lot at the start. Once you learn all the tricks hunters use identifying and avoiding them becomes almost trivial, at least in nullsec. But until you do, you’ll probably lose quite a few ships to cloaky stratioses, gatecamps, etc
---
Yes please.
---
I'm saying we 100% expected it, were prepared for it, and as a result it didn't really hurt us because we knew what to do next.
---
This is exactly what I mean when I said in a previous comment in this chain "I have a lot of personal friends in NCPL but whenever we had a conversation about what to do to try to rebuild/grow the alliance the first question was never "What will goons do if we do that?". I'll let you figure out what it was.".
---
We assumed they were coming and planned our activities/rollout/buildup/*literally everything* in Vale accordingly, including our exit strategy. We planned to defend against them from the moment we got to the south too, and look how their attempt to evict us worked out as a result.
---
TEST as an alliance from the entire period of our exit from Catch and HERO to defeating them when they tried to invade us with FRT in the south built itself around assuming (always rightly) that NCPL were coming for us, and planning appropriately.
---
I actually like the final boss rat with the loot running away more since that means the ratter has to fit a  point or perhaps a web which starts to blur the line between PvE and PvP fits which I think could be interesting.
---
I wish the rats across the board behaved a bit more like players so ratting/missioning involved fighting fewer but more individually challenging and randomized rats who do things like run away to make PvE more interactive &amp; harder to min/max against.
---
That's the risk part which was supposed to be a part of the game and you can prevent yourself getting Effed up by constantly checking DSCAN just like in WH space.
---
It was always just good **fun** to be called PL alts back in the day. So we probably reciprocated and our amusement and teasing to and fro has been taken as confirmation over time? They used to call us HTPL, and "PL pets!"
---
For a time, people were even calling out PL characters to whom they thought I was an alt of. It was all a bit of a laugh really.
---
It's just part of the fun and enjoyment of living with providence as neighbours!
---
templis is a pl alt corp
---
sparton actually is shadoo's cousin
---
calmil is just a way to launder rmt money into caracal navy issues
---
pretty much no repercussions.  TEST deploys seperately from the other alliances.  They are each run independently of one other and have independent finances / rules / etc.  Generally though, if TEST goes to war, Brave, Req, Tikle, DW, (and whomever else) will join them because it is in their best interest and also provides content.
---
Didn't see that 2+ scramble strength bonus.  Thanks!
---
How about the lock times?  Has scan resolution been upped?
---
Sounds like a Billboard.
---
Set it so they have to be at least 500m to 1000 m apart
---
I mentioned no one, you had your own conclusions on who I was referring to.
---
But ok, I’m sure you guys will show everyone how well you fight when that time comes...
---
&gt;It would have it in it's cargo, as the ISK doesn't go directly into the characters wallet, as some % of it is in a physical item. Assuming 50m/h that means the VNI has 150m of loot inside it for you to take if it's been ratting for 6 hours.
---
You're assuming the bots won't just be re-worked to drive by the local citadel and use the new drop off option to deposit the loot before hitting the next site, this would take  a minute or less and have a negligible effect on overall ratting income while making sure that all the hunter can get is the last drop picked up. And your plan still requires the hunter to be able to catch the bot which is the problem in the first place.
---
Being 'PL pets' and 'PL alts' was always part of the fun local banter for us. Years ago were good times.
---
and so none of that negates my original point but in fact reinforces it that there was indeed hateful sentiment against Goons it was just reinforced with the PL nd that your ire once more turned back towards PL.  So why are you arguing with me again?
---
No idea on lock times, only been playing since last August myself, but if your align is more than 2.00s you be lockable by an instalock fit.
---
eh im just being a nerd about it. plus i like to tease Radioactive because he's just not a bright person.
---
It would be fun if it was a strange one-way gate that warped you to a random system.
---
TLDR??
---
I have -no- expectation of safety in EVE ;-).
---
I’m sure to bite the big one on a regular basis.
---
That's the opposite of a good idea lol
---
&gt;Goons are far more benevolent overlords than NCPL ever were.
---
thank u frend
---
Goons have lasted since they started. Since mittens took dictatorial power it's hardly even gone downhall
---
Why care for renters anyway? How about we fix mega coalition/alliances first?
---
There was never hateful sentiment against goons when I was making decisions because I never gave a fuck about goons, I made a gamble long ago that they wouldn't bother attacking us.
---
None of this is about ire or hate or sentiment because when you're building a successful alliance you don't indulge yourself with that shit because you have a responsibility to build the best alliance possible for your players. This is strategic planning.
---
It'd take goons backstabbing TEST for TEST to switch sides. They may eventually grow big enough to be weakly bluetral to goons but it serves neither side to fight a war with their neighbor. It also only serves their mutual enemies favor for them to fight. 
---
In a couple years we may see a big enough Chinese presence that it could either A) Create the United China, or B) one Chinese alliance will get big enough that it becomes the third largest/powerful alliance and then who they side with will matter.
---
Utter BS, there definitely was during that time.
---
I suppose the idea is to make the area seem less interesting, or to reduce killboard losses.  Seems like it just makes the grind easier, though; planting trees so the invading armies can march in the shade.
---
I'm beginning to lose track of how many times I've been forced to move out of nulsec in the past 3 years.
---
&gt;16+ hr active uptime for multiple days.
---
To be fair, these are eve players we're talking about
---
You said yourself, a pve ship is disadvantaged against pvp ship. If pve player gets his reward at the end by looting the overseer effecs, then you have a situation where a new pve meta is to leech in cloaky recon and wait for someone to finish the anomaly, and get both isk and a kill.
---
More than likely but that's never changed.
---
Yes, go do this. You will be fine. There is no contradiction here at all.
---
Nahh, we didn't have the luxury of making decisions that way.
---
It would instagib you.
---
Watch gates. Watch intel channels. Have a defense plan. If your only defense plan is "warp off when someone is in local" then you are not entitled to that safety. It's nullsec. There are risks.
---
OK this is getting into a circle. You are correct it doesn't help them now. But it is not hurting either. At no point have I ever seen news of funding issues?
---
I would go so far to say. If they were in any trouble whatsoever they would not have done what I called a "reverse sale". They would have done a normal PLEX sale in USD as per the whole of 2018. But they don't need to they are loaded.

" Titan supremacy have never been this huge for example "  
---
 I guess you missed the war between the DRF and the old guard Northern Coalition, tracking titans were dropped by the russian in every major fight till the NC just gave up, it took them a few weeks to cause the entire coalition except the goons in Deklein to evac their regions, Titans have totally been this bad before.
---
I remember it up around 40's.  But then again I also remember when the average was 2.5k and then around 4.5k (yea, really, at the start it was just a small bunch of retards like me dicking around).
---
Who knows if the current dip is part of a longer-term trend.  In some ways it must be.  Youngsters are off their MMOs.  Everybody's playing Pac-Man Doodle.  The old vets have arthritis and can no longer use a mouse... etc. etc.
---
If your align time is lower than 2 seconds, you can't be locked, period. Scan res has no say in that.
---
please kb link these great fights
---
maybe not since citadels, but it was very much a thing prior to that.
---
Welcome to Serenity.
---
Also, was gf.
---
Connection hiccups can screw with that but yeah in general that's correct.
---
we have never had 1k titans in one alliance before no. 
---
The fact is that if the PANFAM superfleet dies in this war, there will never be a chance of contesting goon titans again.
---
blue balling and retreating are different though (not saying goons never retreated)
---
In fact I'm just going to set an alpha alt on my new laptop and see if CCP actually give shxx about warp to 0 mods now.
---
It is indeed satire.
---
I run a Dell AW3418DW 1440p as my main display and I absolutely love it. I can't imagine EVE without it.

As a matter of fact, the difference in screen real estate between my ultra-wide and the 24" that I use as my secondary is so stark that I'm actually considering adding another (slightly smaller) ultra-wide for use as a new secondary display for alts.

A zero vote option now exists. It is not, currently, possible to take your vote away. Once you've voted, you've voted.

Can we get a "meh" vote option? There are plenty of things which I don't care about, but don't necessarily think are bad, and also things which I don't know enough about to say whether they are good or bad. I can't filter those things out of the "Things I haven't voted on" page with the current system.
---
Ultra wide is life. I have a billion different windows open and they still don't obscure the game. 
---
My main screen is ultra wide and my second screen is just regular wide. Life is very very good.
---
The bots will just be reprogrammed to dump their loot every site. Real players won’t feel as inclined to dock every site, meaning theyll generally lose more isk when being caught as opposed to bots.
---
I appreciate the idea but this suggestion only works towards lowering isk/h when people (read: bots) play it safe, which they will.
---
The Empire tax rate kills it regardless
---
so seriously, what exactly was the big plan made by csm to make goons the most powerful group. making eve a active game? is that it?
---
It'd be cool if this could get stuck in the /r/eve sidebar as a ticker of some kind. So you could see a new idea pop up that day when you open the sub and vote on it.
---
Yes they have. By the simple reason that if NC/PL loses sov, I dont see them ever interested on taking it back.
---
Game shifted to a numbers game, which is fine, but NC/PL simply dont know how to play that.
---
That's one of the reasons I'm liking the idea of a UW. My UI is a mess,  dscan, probe scanner, chats/intel, fleet, drones, I got so much shit open and that's not even a lot compared to some I've seen. The extra space would be nice. That's a great looking monitor, sadly way out of my price range, maybe one day :)
---
You will be able to set the tax rate according to standings so you and blues can have a 0% player tax and be left with the lowest tax your skills can get you. And then all neutral and non blue players can pay a higher tax You will need some pi mats for upgrading the Gentry but you can have it up fairly quickly. Also it will make you war eligible.
---
I'm dismissing you because you're obviously an idiot that doesn't know what you're talking about.

Also best answer to POCO tax whine, so double kudos.

False. Extremely so. Like, incandescently so.

We had these things called "outposts" and "NPC stations." I dropped an outpost on my own dime, they were so cheap. Only hobos and j-space occupants used POS.

I have a 34 inch 3440 X 1440p. It's glorious, but I tend to stack too many windows so I still feel there's not enough space. But it's great for writing reports in Latex and having reference materials on the other half of the screen... That saved my ass so many times

a covert cloak ship shows up on dscan?
---
&gt; That's the risk part which was supposed to be a part of the game
---
risk has many different forms. the idea for nullsec is that the small-scale risk is lower (because you have local and a static map etc), but war is the large-scale risk you worry about.
---
if people want to make nullsec as risky to the individual as wormholes plus have that existential war risk, that's fine by me. make anoms pay out more than sleepers though.
---
&gt; So making PVE more complex is clearly the right answer.
---
the problem with this is that 90% of people's idea of "complex" isn't, and it just ends up adding tedium.
---
Plex prices arent an issue for nulldwellers no but hs carebears or even low class whs for sure is. But its not THAT big an issue I can agree.
---
But I totally agree the price of t1 mats is rediculess right now. Only solution to this I see besides killing off rorqs is rebalanced null ores again so trit and pyrite arent in them so much. Even then thats not really a solution.. Im just glad ccp finally saw the insurance fraud for what it is.
---
You realise in the entirety of TEST existence has been to find a big blue donut?
---
That implies a civil war between the Chinese factions of Mango and FRT.
---
I care fuck all of the results, but the amount of salt from that war would be fucking epic
---
So, has anybody tried to glue the video slices together? Or do they not line up?
---
Ahhh,.. ok,.. looking at the ship simulator, it defintely was over 2 seconds.  Gonna have to revamp the fit.  Thanks!
---
&gt;Say 10 of my guys have dreads in range they're happy to drop, there is currently no benefit whatsoever in doing that
---
On top of this, it leads to some interesting potential outcomes. You have 40 dudes to ref a fort, and the baddies stand down. You drop 10 dreads to speed up the process, and all of a sudden you have a target sitting in space for 10 minutes.
---
Maybe that gets some interest from people who might want not shoot a 40 man fleet or a building, but might be interested in shooting 10 dreads in siege.
---
I thought I read that in there but couldnt find it! Thanks for finding it for me! Yes I agree!
---
It actually has. Before skillinjectors, and before several autrociously bad ship rebalances. A high SP smaller group could easily fight outnumbered 2 to 1 and potentially win. So N+1 was to extends slightly mitigated. Same with capital usage in the earlier days. It was entirely the schtick alliances like BoB, the original MC, PL, NC., Rooks and Kings with there original pantheon doctrine worked on. WH groups use this technique still to some extend. But as you saw with RAGE, right now no high SP doctrine outperforms a slightly OP T1 ship that has 1000 pilots flying them.
---
If there are no rocks, you can't PANIC
---
You can't kill a group in Eve but they could certainly have occupied their space and denied them ratting space and non-NPC sov space to build industrial structures in.
---
The defender will always leave instantly as soon as local provides them with the 100% accurate intel they don’t like. Why have protection or others in the pocket when the best protection is to never stick around. So much content is never allowed to exist because of local.
---
Still figuring out why my alliance is so important!
---
Forever?  No.
---
They would have left out of boredom.  It was a long, taxing war.  No one group in the MBC could have held goons back.  It was all, or nothing.  There is no possible way that group was holding together long enough to break goons... Sorry.
---
Having never unanchored (have transferred several structures instead upon leaving, or just had them blown-up), is the timer merely resettable, or can it also be stopped?
---
I really think unanchoring is silly.  I'd support a self-destruct feature, though.
---
Oh, so that's what the "0" is? It seems a lot like reddit's vote counter, so I assumed that's what it was. Thanks.
---
You're a self proclaimed WWB starter?  Please don't talk about history you literally know nothing about lmfao. "I started in 2016 as a line member but I totally know the intricacies of how that war worked and definitely know how BoB worked back in 2006!"  lmao
---
I mean that's how most wars are won by having resources and building them into weapons.
---
 I mean kudos to goons tbh. Going from almost dying in the north to absolutely thriving in delve and not been touched outside of the of gank. What did people expect was going to happen? 
---
A bunch of the PanFam Fcs don't play or don't enjoy playing the game much anymore. It's a smart move by PanFam to move to lowsec it might breath new life back into them and turn them back into the nomadic juggernaut they usta be with out having to deal with all the stupid paper pushing of renter's.
---
How about more unpredictable pve sites? Rats that point in every wave? Even more drone aggro? Less pve sites-more impact? A marker for every taken or ongoing site...
---
as mentioned above, this "fix" is only targeted towards active groups. it drives me crazy to think we want to promote rental empires over actually develop and using your space. if we could somehow tie your index as a alliance to how much wealth/power you could collect then maybe. 
---
what if there were a alliance/corp tax each month based on how much assets you have that were lowered based on the collective indexes... although I guess it would only lead to "storage" corp's. unless maybe you could not retrieve assets unless the tax were paid off and starting corp's could not dock at player structures
---
I don't know the specific spreadsheet you are using but I assume it is pulling prices from evemarketer or another website, if this spreadsheet was intended to be shared and used by other people there should be an option to set which station you are in.
---
You can't reference a single thing aside from test getting paid to fight goons to support your point. Yet somehow everyone that had contradicted you is wrong for some reason you can't even articulate outside of personal anecdotal evidence that only you can provide. Sure.
---
I mean whoever bought the bigger blob of Archons won. Even back then weren't goons using LR Dreads in huge numbers to mitigate those fleets. I vaguely remember like Arty Nags and cannot remember if it was a meme or effective.
---
Your point about injectors is true, so because injectors are never going anywhere I'll change my statement slightly.
---
&gt;that'll never change.
---
Depends what you're looking for.
---
want to fly a spaceship? ED all the way.
---
want to actually play a spaceship game? eve every time.
---
That's been the problem since 2010.  People who only complain that it's a problem with the "current" state of nullsec complain because it's now us that has the mostest instead of PL.  A while back the "theater" was anywhere in EVE: if you deployed your supercaps and got caught and PL was on the other side of the map, PL would be there in time to shoot you before downtime ended the fight.
---
He's cute-ish.  
---
I wouldn't shove him out of bed.  Who are we competing with though?
---
Hellspawns are laughably easy to deal with if you want to put in a couple of minutes to doing so. They only really buy the defender an extra couple of minutes, and can pose a danger to a single carrier or battleship that tries to defend the ESS. Source: I've stolen over 2B in ESS money from goons
---
Putting them on citadel grids is not supposed to be a thing afaik, so fixing that is a bug fix rather than a rebalance.
---
This. Elite frigates are so hard to kill without anti-frig weapons, that I lost a 800m tengu on a 8/10 just because I coudn't kill one. 
---
1 per wave, with scram and web, in all ns anoms would be easy enough to implement and would heavily hinder bots since they only use heavy drones.
---
People &amp; Players get to decide for themselves how much risk they want to take.
---
PanFam about to find out how the risks they've taken are going to work out for them.

I believe you may be mistaking citadels for your posting.

I run a normal Maulus as my fast transport lol got a 1.98s align and holds near 400m3 cause I've got it stuffed with small cargo cans.

What if DW's or Tikle's sov gets attacked? Are the other Legacy members obligated to help on defensive operations? Are all Legacy members guaranteed to be aided by TEST if their sov is attacked?
---
You sir are talking through your tinfoil hat.
---
&gt; My group got Lucky we hold our own sov and we are now a small tip on the Daily sov map ( muderous mindset) i have never enjoyed Eve as Mutch since we took sov and hold it
---
I think you've found the sweet spot.  Having a small fiefdom has all the glory and fun of claiming your own sov without all the soul-crushing business of really **managing** entire regions.
---
&gt; A lot of people want to be able to AFK rat or mine.
---
This happened because for many years CCP was actively trying to cap the amount of isk/hr a player could earn. When people came up with new techniques for buzzsawing through anoms with nagas, CCP quickly nerfed it to keep income from exploding. If your active BS could barely out-earn an AFK ishtar, what was the point of doing all that work? It wasn't until the carrier revamp that CCP looked at 100m isk/hr and said fuck it, you can keep it.
---
There were good things about that time, like players not complaining about plex inflation as much and less tilt of earning potential towards vets. But there were also bad things, like how AFK play encourages extreme multiboxing (10 accounts not much different than 2 accounts) and a very boring ratter vs hunter meta. Plus it killed faction war by giving the gallente a permanent in-demand ship to sell for their LP.
---
So that's why AFK "gameplay" got enshrined with the playerbase.
---
I think the reverse should be realistically true. All of 0.0 should have a delay on local, with it being 2 minutes (or some other value) at ADM 0, and decreasing to some lover value (or 0) at ADM 5.
---
You're rewarding people who have invested in their space, and will have relative safety in that space, however in conjunction with the other suggestion, it would also force people to spread to other systems which are probably a lower ADM, making them relatively less safe. 
---
This means you either accept more safety with less resources per person over time, or less safety with more resources. Or option C, I guess, is have enough people that you can have every system at ADM 5 all the time.
---
Only hope is CCP. But even with several major changes it will take years for things to have a.different impact.
---
One day I'll go and see the legendary TDSIN Gingerboi
---
That's actually not the case, you're seeing an evolutionary study in video games. The people who took risks got eliminated from the gene pool. Every game that allows it *has* to end this way.
---
Who's citadels, and when? I don't recall CalMil ever seriously counterattacking our stuff during the offensive. That was kindof the defining characteristic of the campaign. We deleted them from the warzone and they never tried to take the momentum for themselves.
---
What I have done is to huff gas till the rats showup leave the WH and get my PVP fitted ship then kill the rats take the loot then return with my venture and get the rest of the gas.
---
Thats the eve dublin meet your after. Were all over #whboo
---
Yes, because my point is soooooo reliant on personal experiences rather than historic observations.
---
Only if they complete the site.  Sniping the last rat could become the new counter for super safe PVE and botting.
---
If eve is dying why is someone buying Eve?
---
The LR nags back then never really worked because of the repping power of those massive archon blobs. (Which was unbalanced). But a group bringing in a 1000 subcaps could beat a 200 cap fleet. But clever use of that 200 could also win. As was visible in the test fountain war. 
---
What I am trying to convey. There where options. Not allot but atleast some. Right now n+1 dominates every viable doctrine. Mostly thanks to the cancer that is injectors.
---
You're just on a roll with these dumb posts today, aren'tcha, buddy?
---
Its entirely reliant on actually having been there lmfao.  Sit down and shut up guy who has only read third party accounts of what happened and thinks he has the picture.
---
I'm just saying it's dissonant to my ears suggesting the coalition famous for blue-balling is the "we just want to have fun" coalition.
---
wait so what does chernogorsk mean
---
Which they didn't even give to the right people.
---
We are in agreement. But it will eventually be something other than titans that are the n+1 mechanism.
---
Legion also has drones. Like someone else said, never extract drone skills.
---
I already quit the game because of this and various other problems, EVE has gone to shit and I'd rather not spend anymore time money or energy on it. 
---
Good luck. o7
---
You mean you're actually going to undock titans for us to shoot? Man, I underestimated you guys.
---
Well, no. Imicuses can't instawarp unless you have implants for it. You're "instantly hitting warp button" which is different.
---
Asteros can warp from button to go in less than 2 seconds. That means that even without the advantage of covops, it is impossible to lock them coming out of a gate no matter how high your scan resolution is, unless you live extremely close to EVE servers and have crazy boosted scan res. This is because of the 1hz server tick.
---
So to catch these things, you have to bubble as soon as they enter local from your gate... and for the brief 1 second you see them decloak, you better get that direction exactly right because you have to double click fly towards them and nail them by flying within 2km to break their cloak, and hope they haven't moved too far or warped off already.
---
So basically an RnG rewarded market bot? 
---
Let me get this right, you’re too lazy to successfully market PvP so you want an easier way?
---
But then the bots just would switch to a dominix or something than can facetank the anom's dps while staying close to the mtu. Neuts enter local &gt; scoop mtu/drones  &gt; warp out.
---
What I believe people are forgetting is that EVE is played by people. There will be new players coming in and making new groups or even just break aways from current organisations wether down to in-game politics or just wanting something else.
---
Along with this people will inevitably leave EVE including, eventually, leaders bringing new ones and we know how power vacumes work in the real world with splits and power grabs it's not hard to believe this will happen to ours too. 
---
Life in these kind of games is ever changing and evolving there is no endgame so no singular power can permanently dominate the playing field. 
---
Just my 2 pence hope you liked it

Gorsk basically means ville so basically Blackville.

Trust me I know, I was on the CSM when CCP was balancing Asset Safety and vulnerability timers for Citadels!

Of course. Sacrifices must be made. The sooner we get it over with, the sooner you can all go back to Delve and get back to full scale krabbing.

Also when you salvage stuff from wrecks (not loot but salvage) those parts can be used to manufacture rigs which can then be sold on the market.
---
I do love the fact that when PL dropped 100 slow cats on BC they had skils....
---
I should hope people paying for Omega are doing it because they enjoy what it allows them to do in game, and not to get a prize every six months or whatever. Also, CCP has given us a game, and if you're not paying for it, you're getting *everything* for free and don't really have a right to complain about the quality of your free prizes for the free game you play for free.
---
I NEVER adjust my market orders by .01. It's always 1k, or 10k or 101k or 2k. It's fun when people get used to adjust by a little so when bold adjustments happen they have a larger chance to mess up. Market errors in my favor are my favorite.
---
Mate if you want effortless market just buy from people's sell orders.
---
If you want cheap then go spend the effort.
---
You can't have effortless and cheap.

Sounds pretty balanced.

only the mighty backbone of Imperium can keep count. logistics

&gt; there was indeed hateful sentiment against Goons

Maybe among some old members, but when leadership says, "this is what we need to do", and line members can see it makes sense, then that's what you do.

We just did was what obviously best for us.  It's PL/NC. that had the freedom to create the situation they did.

If they had been smarter about handling CO2 and TEST in Vale/Tribute, we wouldn't have the bluetral relationship with goons we have now.

You're absolutely right, nobody can know anything about history unless we were personally there. Which is why I stand by the obvious fact that Romans rode velociraptors into battle against the Nazis.

Travel fit ceptors need to align in less than two seconds if you want them to be insta-warp capable. Although there is a small exception. If you live in Australia your ping might be too high for someone camping you in the UK. You won't be able to get insta-warp ships fitted. I see this happen with hotspot wifi internet too at times.

these spawn rate nerfs were mainly aligned to adjust capital ratting afaik, while it forces people to spread out (which is something i support) it doesn't affect real human beings who like to krab 23h a day, neither it will affect that it is possible to turtle in deadends for the whole week.
---
I don't remember that happening, ever (they still drop stronger stuff, but not titans and supers). I do remember that happening vs Goons in Deklein and Delve very often. At least don't lie this blatantly.
---
he says... posting in r/Eve...
---
It will if you nerf hard enough...
---
&gt; you must find someone you can attack regardless of who they are or how many times you have fought them.

So... goons?  Nah, too hard.  They have supers and everything. NCPL needed an easier target.

They live explicitly in space where most of those 150 systems are in direct range of each other.
---
The more egregious problems are empires that can range over 3+ regions with impunity because of jump bridges
---
One of the problems is that botting software from 7 years ago still works. Just some small changes will at least drop the variety of bots.
---
A large portion of high sec pocos are owned by shell corps or under protection agreements of major blocs or merc orgs.
---
Receive farmground access and umbrella protection in exchange of paying taxes and your +1 in titan fleets and suddenly it's not renting lmao.
---
When rental space was more popular compared to the mega empire space less explosions and content was denied in this game. They didn't have boson titans every gate.
---
PS: Small alliances don't carve space not because there is no space, but because carving space doesn't make any sense at all compared to joining one of the blocs. The blocs are the cancer here, not the rental space.
---
So?
---
Virginity rigs installed.
---
Actually Goons have historically reported and filed complaints about exploitable mechanics. Once CCP confirms they don’t care about it THEN they exploit it to illustrate the issue. Nothing game breaking or Eula violating, just ~EVE working as intended~.

I would be interested in how your scenario looks like. Imho i would assume that most players have some kind of balance and do in general a mix of playstyles, pve/pvp/etc. and therefore would like to use space on their own. Of course there are exceptions, but i think thats more some kind of minority.
---
Not sure why the amount of shit-posts have increased rapidly the past few days on here. Does it have to do with the Plex prices or something? Now these guys can't resub so they shit-post on here instead?

&gt;vote for the things which you'd like to see changed in Eve
---
Yeah right, as if most retards here know what is good for them.
---
Depending on the item, I have found just waiting for a few days, even if you are much lower on the price list than most, actually seems to pay off with a lot of items. Patience seems to pay dividends sometimes in EvE market PvP.
---
So.  It’s shit gameplay and I could care less if non-bots had to give it up.
---
You say that but when I taxed people on a POCO in highsec it was because I took it from someone else.
---
And it was also on me to, you know, defend my property.
---
If they can't defend it, they don't afford to have it, sure. But try and take one - you'll find many (if not most) are owned by people with the capability to defend it.
---
&gt;TLDR: Yes CCP is bad. Bots are bad. But the playerbase is bad too.

 I lived out of one for almost three years back when the northern coalition and not an alliance's name. NPC stations were not in every system, and maybe you were rich enough to afford one but the average old guard Northern Coalition line member was not going to drop a personal station in branch or venal or tribute just so they could belt rat in peace.

Holy shit here it is, the game change Olmeca would inevitably ask for, the ultimate “easy win” button.
---
You didn't need 1000 titans during the tracking days, back then 100 titans,  which the DRF had was more than enough to end any fight just by dropping them.
---
That would address botting at least, and to some extend that null would get more dangerous.
---
But its just too one sided, it mainly makes ratters easy to kill. In my opinion similiar to the local delay/nerf we often read here.

Shhh,

It's probably because everyone and their mothers have read Jestertrek's AMA about his NDA expiring, and after having read it, they believe they are the fountain of knowledge and god's gift to EVE Online because only THEY know the solution to all of the problems from the AMA.

For years the biggest argument against rorqual nerfs was "rorquals are dying so they are not OP, just bring more people". This subreddit is just gonna push shit ideas.
---
Yeh, i guess the result is probably similiar, maybe even better. But harder to implement i think.
---
You left that avatar at a dying structure, you had at least 1 week to move it out, your loss. If people are gonna bash citadels that have literal doomsdays, then there needs to be proper reward for doing so. In this case, the reward was your titan that you didn't evac or use to defend.
---
Yes actually too hard, it has been many many years since NCPL could go toe to toe against goons without a bunch of allies.
---
Its not like Test is about to go out and fight goons right now..., absolutely no one expects that. But Test still needs content so they too are looking for people to fight. Luckily there is WinterCo near by who are strong enough to stand up to them without collapsing but too weak to retaliate against Legacy in a way that would hurt them before Goons can show up.
---
Everything I have heard said about NCPL's actions is going to be said about Test's actions if the game lives long enough.

I didn’t see it mentioned, but slightly related for you is that the “combat” interceptors are no longer nullified now. So make sure to fit up the ceptors with the tackle bonus.

I know there is a term for this sort of phenomenon, probably sounds something like "false expert fallacy" or something.
---
I think you guys are going to do much better up north than most everyone else. Even some of your guys are a little doom and gloom. I think fighting a defensive war up north will make them pay and it will be glorious.
---
no.  DW's or Tikles sov is their own business, they have to defend it themselves.  Now if someone like FRT or SkillU invades, then sure it makes a ton of sense because they could be next.  Or if they ask for help, people aren't going to say no.  but there is no obligation.
---
In general though, if content shows up in the region, there is a good chance that a large portion of Legacy will be there.  cause why wouldn't you?
---
Why are you so salty?
---
Agreed, HTPL was always my favorite nickname for you guys. I don't want to speak for anybody else but at least I know that you as individual pilots largely are your own people.

I'm amazed how many downvotes I ate in this thread, but hey -- not everyone gets it as well as we do. These are basically just team rivalries after all.

Would be really nice to see something change on the mechanical level from CCP that allows for a little more movement, as things are really static these days.

Maybe, though don't underestimate how much of having a short break from EVE due to RL can fuck you over then!

I had it bad a while back when not long after getting my first T3C (a legion) that cost me a huge portion of my total wealth at the time, the POS in my corp's WH was bashed then destroyed as I was on a 5 day sailing holiday with too poor connection to login.

Either way I also believe the risk/reward balance is out of whack now that everything is too safe.

Because they were offered $425m for it?
---
Imperium found a way to be on top of the game and mechanics CCP gave us, yes, but the game and mechanics that allowed such a thing to happen are flawed.
---
If CCP fucked up and everyone was given 100,000,000,000 SP, would it be fair for them to remove it? Probably not, but not doing so would ruin the game.
---
It's the same situation here. CCP enabled the Imperium to rise to the top through a chain of poor decisions. If they don't do something, the game is ruined for *everyone*. I'd rather the Imperium take a temporary hit than EVE dying out because it came to mirror Serenity.
---
&gt; Bro stop baselessly claiming that we are ~gaming the system
---
I didnt make any claims about you.
---
&gt; Holy shit here it is, the game change Olmeca would inevitably ask for, the ultimate “easy win” button.
---
You have so many of those buttons, beginning from umbrella mechanics.
---
I don't base my proposals to what I need. Your space is too safe. It's breaking the game. CCP should change it.
---
You on the other hand, are merely interested in preserving your safe krabbing.
---
Big difference being that Battleships are painfully slow. You will have a way better chance catching a battleship. Domi has a  Base Time to Warp of almost 18 second vs a VNI of 6.9 seconds.
---
You're interested in shitposting.
---
I'm interested in game balance.
---
If you shitpost in favor of a broken game, I will respond.
---
Other than that you are an idiot. I don't have anything to do with your attention and you know it. So perhaps don't say things just to say it. Even shitposts should make logical sense.
---
Low quality bait.
---
The clear alternative was to sit up north and sing kumbaya forever and ever
---
&gt; That's been the problem since 2010
---
Yes, although jump fatigue did mitigate it somewhat. Now that's not even true with Ansiblex gates. It was just as bad when PL could drop their fleet anywhere in Eve.
---
not as long as you would think, rattles are really simplistic so it only takes them a couple seconds each.
---
Same with me and anomaly ratting
---
Repeated the topic for maximum brain fart
---
I bought an LG IPS ultrawide about a year ago now 0 regrets and not even for eve since I've been o ly playing for a month but the colors are amazing
---
The hacking mini game is a solved problem with a simple algorithm. You don't see many bots FCing, though, or running logi in incursions, or things like that.
---
Tell that to our keepstar that Fraternity paid for.
---
Of course the root of all those resources come from mining and ratting.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion... But I don't think this problem is readily fixable without making the game significantly less fun (More hands on while wanting to mindlessly bot/mine). I loved EVE for a long time, but since the full scope of DUST 514 failed to launch, I don't think it has anywhere to go.
---
Personally, I'm looking forward to Star Citizen, I feel like it's the closest thing to what DUST 514+EVE would of been.
---
If CCP manages to pull a rabbit out of a hat, maybe through some insane act of re balancing everything I would love to come back, but until then, I just can't put in the hours to match the state of things.
---
Say what if, high idea, what if bots were... Allowed. and somehow took over the role of rats! like they would sit in areas AFK gaining passive isk and have some sort of warp constraint so they couldn't get away! and while sitting in those areas they would accrue a bounty! So they could be manned or unmanned!
---
Did you see the doctor for penis inspection?
---
So, more than ten years ago. Yeah, that isn't relevant at all any more.
---
I agree which is why I said it's not a bad thing. But I also don't think that it really addresses the specific goal of eradicating bots.
---
Personally I used ceptor with 2 hyper rigs. Inertia lows. 2 medium shield. 1/2 adaptive and 0/1 mwd. High is normally a cloak.
---
Yeah
---
Same here! Id love to get the account info for that main I never knew I had.
---
But that’s the language used.  “In the imperium”.
---
Not exactly. I don’t want to steal wrecks, but I know I can’t scan down wrecks, so I’m just messing around to see if I can find som way to get to unattended wrecks and salvage them.
---
like honestly the solution for t1 mats and rorqs in my mind are linked its all about making less ore per system to the point where the larger group will just empty there region of ore and need more space, as currently nullsec can carry way to many players per region.
---
Yeah, I get the feeling he is the guy asking when the umbrella will go green again during a stratop and probably still has his death clone set to D-P. Also probably the 50m sp character flying a crucifier in the nightmare fleet when he is dragged kicking and screaming out of his krab hole.
---
Yeah dude I think you’re lying to yourself if you think they’ll really go all that way for some shit storm tidi fest.  Y’all are in for a butt whoopin
---
Needs to contribute to z0r chains in local, with that in place we're onto a winner
---
The same as last time they came up to give us one? They killed a keepstar and some titans, and then went home. Why would this time around be any different?
---
That's because nobody is willingly going to fleet up with a bot. That's just asking to be collateral damage in a ban wave.
---
That's interesting, thanks. That definitely gives some perspective. VNIs/Ishtars online was already the norm by the time I started playing.
---
It cannot be said that snuff is bad at profiteering
---
* Isk from the aggressing side of WWB
---
* Cheap supers and titans from the defending side of WWB
---
Sorry?  It’s a legit question.  It’s thrown around like the entire half of the map from Immensea to outer rim is fucking blue and open access.  Such a misconception by people who have probably never even taken the first gate in catch.
---
Why not just give all anomaly rats tackle?
---
The problem with catching botters is that they can stay aligned. Remove that ability and they become incredibly easy to catch. This is especially true for sebo botting normal carriers, also. 
---
Doesn’t fix the problem but it at least gives us content out of them rather than them being more annoying to catch than actual people. 
---
This effects real players too, but not as much as bots don’t pay attention to intel. Also, fuck real players they can take one for the team.
---
I dont disagree with you per say, most people want some kind of mix. But that's actually what's going on in goons right now. the propaganda let you believe that they are all just crabs but in reality it's the best organizations to be in if you want to pvp as well, except maybe horde. but in goons you have it all.
---
anyway that's beside the point, if this change went in its likely that goons (who are the nr 1 empire builders in eve) would simply switch from using their space to renting out space for isk and I dont be live that alliance model is better. I believe it's way worse
---
I still don't get why did cfc decide to go for hrdnx.
---
Ah, so you are a coward in your speech as well.
---
We're arguably already 5 years past Eve's high point, more depending on what you consider the "high point".
---
The best way would be to see if a ship that could be used for ratting appear in a spot outside of any warpable object with your DSCAN, meaning he’s in a dead space pocket. Then scan him down and steal the wrecks as you go. 
---
IIRC : salvaging does not give you a suspect timer, but looting does. That way, if the ratting ship decide to shoot you because your "stealing" his wrecks, he’ll get CONCORDOKKEN and you’ll be able to get whatever dropped from his own wreck (and they generally fit expensive modules, even more on faction battleships in high tier missions). 
---
Another way would be to look out for Mobile Tractor Units (MTUs) which can be scanned down with combat probes. Generally, that mean the missionner will come back at some point with a salvaging ship (another destroyer, or a big fat Noctis).
---
Yep! Near as we figure, it's their term for luminosity.
---
I mean, it isn't like that was the first, or only time they did that, lol.
---
Mista. This is the fourth in the survey-style directives, though the first with a non-'survey' directive naming.
---
Cause fucking sort bought them off and sent them packing with FORTY FUCKING FACTION FORTIZARS...
---
Or are you planning on dropping the ransom check as soon as they land in pure blind?
---
Yea honestly.. They need to overhaul anomalies in k space.. They're all fucked.. Hs isk yield is pointless ls is deadsec.. And null only rallies and up get ran.. Escalations are literally the only thing going for them. Beyond that go to a c1 its better than anything else anomaly wise..  
---
Ore anoms I dont think actually matter.. They should just be removed from null.. Go mine in bets you mother fuckers lol. There is SSOOOOOOOO much ore in space.. This is all besides the need for a scaling system where you mine to much all you get is veldspar.l
---
A lot of brain storming must went into this one
---
they'll tweet a bunch about how shit the game is now that people other than them have super fleets and how you should go skiing with them.
---
is that an Amar Temple?
---
he manipulated you into asking it  
---
this is eve
---
You'd have to be very careful in changing drone aggro. That kind of change could very easily make drones entirely unusable in PVE, for players as well as bots.
---
And because bots will have a far easier time adjusting than real players, it would have a far bigger impact on the real players.
---
Slowcats were cancer and water is wet
---
\*see Ultracows' youtube vids
---
idk, content is content I guess
---
its a dream come true  this is what we wanted in Eve for years
---
supercaps can't take nu-jumpbridges.  you can whore on a supercap fight in subcaps on your borders by using nu-jbs but you can't get your supercap fleet there to drop on them that way
---
I have been in both and its a bunch of internal test narrative thats it, sorry ro break it to you.
---
Were moving to tribute when PL leaves and we swipe a keepstar.
---
Both alliances are shells of what they were. You have been around long enough to know that.
---
The one thing that EVE's top dogs at any given time have shared is the number of subs they draw for CCP. Eve online politics/conflict draw a lot of parables with real life conflicts but the one massive difference between EVE &amp; IRL is the fact that EVE does have GOD with out dispute. That god is CCP, anger it or fail to pay it tribute and it will bring  an Armageddon upon you.
---
The god in EVE only cares for one thing and that is $'d PLEX. If your alliance pays it tribute via generated subs then it will reward you with invincibility &amp; bestow other gifts upon you. But if you drain it of subscription then you will be destroyed or open to player destruction. Case in point WWB, goons were utterly defeated until hail CCP, smited their enemy. Goons lost plain and simple, it took CCP intervention and fear of loss of IRL subscription to bring them back.
---
Goons will in game be defeated by new China as they simply bot better than them &amp; one hardcore botter is worth more than 100 normal crabbers. The deciding factor will be if new China can gain enough subbers to appease the CCP god before being smited by the meta.
---
But FC! We want to fight!
---
I don't really think that you're ever going to fully eradicate botting in any game though. There's always going to be crafty and resourceful programmers out there. But in the case of Eve, writing a bot has to be so easy... I know that I could literally sit down and write out the workflow of exactly what a bot should to in about 10-15 minutes with pseudo-code and I've never written a front end automation before.
---
Also, it being that dead simple means that it's really difficult to tell a bot from a human. There's just so little interaction involved that it's hard to differentiate a truly bot-like pattern.
---
Making the bot have to deal with a lot more randomness, a lot more UI, a lot more interaction, would almost certainly lessen the amounts of bots and also make it easier to detect the patterns of how the remaining bots behave.
---
is it blue though...
---
TEST + PanFam probably wouldn't have been enough to keep us perma-homeless and lowsec voltron/CO2 weren't gonna leave their home.  We were always going to bounce back, and the advent of citadels made an provi-campaign style castle-kicking adventure impossible.  That said though having almost no interference for years probably helped.
---
Yeah i don't have time for them soo
---
People were asking for occupancy based sov which we still do not have. There is a whole lot of sov that is not occupied but is still "owned" by an entity.
---
Occupancy also does not necessarily mean concentration of resources to support a large number of players in a small space.
---
I am pretty sure NCPL were not all on board for jump fatigue, rorqual mining, skill injectors and sp farms which is what enabled the current state of affairs.
---
I got a crazy one, so hear me out... how about "THE RACE IS ON"?
---
Shutup and get back to making my toys
---
thats the thing though, those were different times, with different mechanics. asset safety wasnt a thing, citadels are entrenched in delve. and if so imperium gets uprooted, the game mechanics are such that that massive armada can redeploy and still remain the dominant force in the game, even if their warchest is reduced by even 50 or most 70 percent.
---
i mean ive tripple boxxed drone boats... you still have to click gate, click jump, click launch drones, and right click assist.. all times 36
---
Prediction : Eve will survive...  in spite of all gnashing of teeth and gums....
---
[Let's &amp; Go!](http://imgur.com/a/KiMVsKO)
---
They will be able to know which char looted it yes. But the trick is for CCP to determine now if that char was just a random ganker or an alt of the hacker. Very hard to tell the difference.
---
Couldn't randomizing the waves /spawns in the anoms help in some way?
---
And I'm not trying to discredit the player contributions. You're right, there is a lot of player driven content happening all the time. NPCs give out the same missions over and over. But big name alliances wage war over territory and stuff, and the political landscape changes all the time.
---
But like I said, they do still have things like Faction Warfare, and Standings, and even the different racial ships. Lore is out there, it's happening, it's part of the game. So they should put more effort into maintaining and supporting that underlying narrative.
---
It would be like WoW starting out with stories of the Alliance and the Horde, of the Elves and the Orcs. And then just dropping all of it. No mention of the races or the factions anymore. No more emphasis on the sides of the conflict. No Faction based expansions. Just giving up on storyline and saying "you go do it".
---
It does, it's just that groups like The Imperium and Test do it in such a scale that for individual players, it still takes weeks/months but en-mass Titans are being churned out at an astonishing rate!
---
The original context was it never happened, which it did, just not any time in recent years. That's not the same as never.
---
You do realize how long ago those other wars were right?
---
&gt;in favor of a broken game
---
&gt;you are an idiot
---
&gt;should make logical sense
---
The levels of irony in your posting is astounding. You consistently ask for changes that can be mass exploited (*by us lol*), you are - in fact - the most laughably dumb person on this subreddit, and 0% of your posts have ever included “*logical sense*”.
---
Hahaha
---
Removing Local will only make things very slightly better though. After a day or two, you now have an Alpha sitting on every gate grid, a couple hundred kilometers off the gate, watching their Overview for hostiles. Bonus points if they can do so tethered to a Citadel also on-grid, though I'm not sure if that's a thing still (I've been gone for a while).
---
Some longer-term logoff traps could work for covert drops, but there would be very little change for the roaming playstyle.
---
French flag?
---
Ship made active once, never undocked for sale?
---
Coming from a provi FC, I was pretty bummed when i had to tell all the guys no big fight tonight sorry test changed their minds. So yeah the content part kinda sucks. I know we can't kill it on our own RC have us beat number wise in USTZ for sure. But I'll still keep fighting.
---
If you think about it his goal is to get the ultimate killmail,.The game itself. So in a weird kinda of way he is already trying.
---
Are you sure it shouldn't be pure white?
---
Prepare to meet your new best friend, the [Luxury Yacht](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Victorieux_Luxury_Yacht)
---
Look into the sunesis. Can tank a few smart bombers, instawarp, and carry about 1500m3
---
Your Overseer idea is similar in concept to how CCP adjusted capital escalations in wspace.
---
Back load the rewards with a new, contestable source; people stealing your drifter spawns in wspace or sniping/looting your OPE in your idea.
---
Seems like a decent concept.
---
A screenshot I made. Thought is it nOice
---
You can take capitals through an Ansiblex though right? Capital projection is almost as cancerous as supercap projection.
---
But yeah the problem is really cynos, Ansiblex gates just make it marginally worse.
---
can confirm, not a pl alt. ain't doing that shit again.
---
&gt;I don’t base my proposals to what I need.
---
This is a complete lie lmao but I guess sociopathic individuals don’t recognize when they are acting in self interest.
---
HE LACKS CRITICAL INFORMATION PepeLaugh
---
wims80, Please take care to read the article before raging because you see one statement that upsets you.
---
Any game where new, free accounts can be created infinitely, make decent income early on, then transfer that to older accounts is going to have a big botting problem.
---
Bots in eve are incredibly bad and lots of people are suggesting ways to stump them.  It's possible those will work, but it's also worth looking at how sophisticated bots can get in other games.  I've played a lot of Lineage 2 as an example, there the bots are sophisticated enough they don't even need the client, they'll communicate directly with the server - and with each other outside the game entirely to coordinate entire alliances in ways that aren't otherwise possible in the game, auto-assisting, auto-targeting healers, coordinating across groups for heals/resurrects/debuffs/etc.  While there were always bots, as soon as the game went f2p, the numbers exploded.
---
Maybe small changes to make bots less profitable or slightly harder to execute will work, but if they do it's only because no one thinks it's worth the effort to make good bots for the game.  To really stop botting, you have to break something from the chain they rely on of low effort/cost accounts that can quickly make decent income and the ability to transfer that to their mains.  Until you do that, bans don't have any consequences.
---
the "smug elite culture" is not always as real as people make it out to be... and some of the more toxic groups are now in Test itself...
---
In HTP for example one of the first things new members tend to hear is stories about how we did something completely idiotic and somehow survived, usually because the enemy thought we were "good at the game" and didn't react to our fuck up. Yet our enemies tell their line members that we are just a bunch of smug elite assholes.
---
We recruit people that we want to play with, the result is that our average player is just slightly better than recruiting anyone with a pulse. For this we are smug elite assholes.
---
Another way of looking at it is that Test are now the "smug elite culture" to other new organizations. They drop supers on anyone in your space and tell targets to get better when out numbering them 100 to 1.
---
mh goons has enough people to play farms and fields in probably 3-4 regions without problems, in the worst case they need to move a bit to get like two backpocket/hard to reach regions actually.
---
Also i think they are aware that it is far more lucrative to use it on their own, since they have the numbers to do so. Renting is probably nice, but won't generate as much isk. Also renters would need more systems, which would probably reduce the prices of now.
---
But thats lots of possible options, could also be the exact opposite mh
---
Cynosure and wormholes would like a word with you.
---
Yeah,.. I wasn't thinking fully functional fit.  I though it was enough just to get around and see whom was occupying some of the systems my stuff has been at for a couple years:  The camp that originally got me ( [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76749110/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76749110/)  )  actually had a smartbombing ship at the system exit gate when I went through it the second time.  The original ship fit aligned at 2.04 seconds (taking into account the genolution implants I had at the time).  If I hadn't had a shield extender the second time, would of lost another one.
---
I just use a tv
---
This very much.
---
The Race is On
---
Yeah I'm aware, didn't really need something that big or pricy, plus those draw more attention than a little dumb maulus.
---
Funny how those same people talk about how hard core they are for playing eve, but Fortnight players risk more than they do.
---
Do you think a bot could run abbyssal sites? Because if there is something about abyssals that prevents bots from being able to run them, then thats what anomalies need to become!
---
Forgot 4000m3 drone bay for my warriors IIs, I promise.
---
Same here. I forgot a couple times, before getting my shit together and remembering to log in every day. Now I have an alarm, cause if I miss one more time I lose it.
---
he is uncontested in the realm of ping spamming though
---
Everytime I see this same thread ( by different people, with different titles, but its always the same), I realize that people are misidentifying the enemy.
---
The enemy isnt goons, ccp, blue donuts, sov systems or anything else.  The problem is the one thing humans have no grasp on, and that's human nature.
---
The reason why eve is the way it is is the same exact reason why most of us live in houses and we have this internet thing to screw around on.  Its why we live in NATIONS rather than small tribes like our ancestors.
---
Humans are not competitive, nor are we cooperative. Humans are OPPORTUNISTIC, what ever gives us the most advantage (be it cooperation, competition or something else) that delivers the best results and comfort, thats ehat will happen.
---
Thus EVE, a game that should be about conquest and strife, if actually a game where most characters reside in high security space and those that dont find ways to make whatever space they do play in (be it null, WH, or low.sec ) as muchich like high sec as humanly possible.
---
Ccp cant fix that. When they tried to give us more stuff to fight over, we all found ways to get it without fighting (like OTEC).  If there is a fix, I dont know what it is.
---
WHAA my invincible stations where all my assets are 100% safe that I pay nothing to dock in or upkeep isnt safe enough.
---
If by play you mean drop every super they can muster on you; yeah, sure.
---
Get a character in a corp that’s blue to the botters. Find bots in a covops frigate, park 300k off the anom. When the loot rat pops warp to the wreck and scoop the bounty. If there are 4+ bots in one system you’re making 4x what you would ratting if you time it right
---
Confirming this is Satire.
---
Atleast in Planetside 60% of the players are not sitting afk docked up 23 hours a day
---
I didn't kill the ship that killed me: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76749110/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76749110/)  .  I looked up some of his death mails and it's fit with 2 warp scramblers.  The maulus:  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76749916/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76749916/) 
---
Anyways, think I got a ship fit now that will work.
---
Thanks!
---
If it's not, it is definitely Satan.
---
Eve has more alt accounts and People docked up afk Then most online games
---
my azz is ultra wide, where's my upvote!
---
And can be renamed, with emojis allowed.
---
wrong, you still can. limit is 1s
---
Don't forget the Israëliërs
---
&gt; You consistently ask for changes that can be mass exploited
---
Almost like I ask for game balance and not base my proposals on who will benefit from them, unlike you.
---
&gt;  the most laughably dumb person on this subreddit
---
Notice even when I say you are an idiot I have an argument behind. You said I wanted attention. I have no use for your attention. Therefore you are an idiot for saying that.
---
You just wanna spew toxic hate, sling shit and insults. You can't talk to me about making logical sense.
---
Careful though. This much hate will give you cancer someday.
---
citadels, fozzie sov, local
---
In this, we are in agreement.
---
Literally this - Panfam in the past did particularly well poaching super pilots from other alliances, therefore pushing up their level of power projection. Nowadays, they should really focus on poaching miners and industry players, but for some stupid reason refuse too - they really need to stomp out the '2 1337 4 mining' culture if they ever want to live up to their old reputation again.
---
Lol bro get over it already
---
15k are Being docked up 23/7 and never undock
---
&gt;If CCP fucked up and everyone was given 100,000,000,000 SP, would it be fair for them to remove it? Probably not, but not doing so would ruin the game.
---
Yes it would be fair because every player would be effected equally.
---
What wouldn't be fair is every player receiving SP and then only Imperium members losing their SP.
---
CVA is so incompetent they can't bash jump bridges without feeding small shit. In the end they only gave up a few subcaps in exchange for TRC tackle but meanwhile TRC can run riot through provi un-contested until the last second when CVA sends in a single carrier to feed as the cherry on top after a long night of entosising.
---
Sunesis is a 10 mil hull, not going to attract much attention since it’s honestly a pretty bad ship
---
1 isk?
---
It is described as being 3 light years from the New Eden system proper. Likely, given the fact it is in essence a giant flamethrower of exotic radiation one cannot warp to it. As for the SOE, if they have any presence out there it would probably be in deep space closer to the gate.
---
That doesnt suprise me. People are complaining that null has become shit. Plex prices rising so the average working dad that plays Eve 4 to 8 hours a week Cant pay his omega and doesnt have the money to buy the subscription.
---
Lol true, my Maulus is a 12m fit mainly cause of the T2 rigs. 6.25au/s, sub 2s align, 4500ehp.
---
@elric225

From my understanding is, WAFFLES a former PL Corp after it was absorbed into PL is a major factor for the RC coalition. Which accounts for at-least half of their fleet members. Also most of the corps harbor PL alts and former PL/NC Members. There is a couple corps/alliances in RC that are former Provi-Bloc Members. TRC For example attempted to join Provi but were shunned and treated poorly by CVA leadership and found a much more open and friendly partnership with HTP/PHEW at the time that formed into the RC Coalition. Now as far as i know, looking at dotlan for example. Provi-bloc still holds 91% of providence. While RC only holds 9%. Also if you look at time events and relate them to zkill you will see that in 90% or more cases there were fights over these items, while looking at the RC structures/Sov Timers it's only 65% or less. (this may be due to the saturation of the 20+ astras killed around christmas with no contested killmails for the majority of those). But both sides looking at the dotlan events/timerboar/zkill 100% of all sov timers were contested by either side. (This is based on killboards at the time of the timers) and it looks like a majority ended in some form of major engagement.  
---
Just because you dont log in doesn't mean the enemy wont form. Look a little closer at your friends they may not be what they seem hmm?
---
??
---
You literally never got your shit blown up before when there were stations.
---
kinda rude to frenchers tbh
---
Goons don't dominate wormhole space because domination requires an ability to constantly enforce over your power. A decisive victory over the strongest wh corp, while scary, does not suddenly mean goons are dominating wh space.
---
They could, but they ain't here... So there's no domination.
---
Is this a RvB ad?
---
actually it was 10 keepstars but whos keeping track
---
if I were their member, I'd certainly make it propaganda/art for them. :)
---
Panfam invaded when TEST was the only one that followed Goons into Delve.
---
Now Goons and TEST hate Panfam and everyone is acting surprised lmao.
---
It's at least a draw.
---
While both are bad, I would rather get dropped on by 3 supers from a small independent entity than 30 supers from the landlords of a renter empire.
---
Many tasks (especially mining) are FAR to passive,making it easy to bot. By making these tasks more engaged and active,botting would likely decrease.
---
You just told me I was proposing things you can benefit from.
---
You have to choose one mate.
---
Also every other claim you make about my mental health reflects on you. You're either projecting or merely human trash for always bringing Eve arguments to mental health. Same goes for many of your friends.
---
I was watching the fleet composition as TRC moved to defend, WAFFLES had a small presence in YM that night. TRC is absolutely the frontline of the RC presence in Providence and deserves more credit for their work.
---
yeah but gsol will scream bloody murder about moving that much fucking ozone around.  and capitals are nearly useless in a real supercap fight unless they're faxes, and who wants to third party with faxes?
---
the real problem is that there is no rock/paper/scissor when it comes to supercaps: the only counter to a sufficient number of supercaps is more supercaps.  there's no fleet composition that can inflict disproportionate losses on supercaps to grind them down, no fleet composition that counters supercaps, it's just more supercaps, or dreadbombing the occasional straggler which, while fun, is strategically irrelevant
---
You're right in that you can't 'beat' human social engineering, but regards your last point, that's exactly what happened on the Chinese server.
---
Is this your application for employment with CCP?
---
Stfu retard you're embarrassing yourself
---
Aren't renters 3/4 of eve?
---
What makes you think bots won't just drop off overseer effects after every site? 
---
It will me a mild inconvenience for the bitter to add that. Less isk efficient. But it's still going to make easy risk free isk so meh. 
---
On the other hand. It hurts real players that don't want to do that because it's a chore. Having to dock up constantly. 
---
It will make pvp more rewarding for the hunters. But it won't make killing bots more rewarding.

I'd like progod to yell at me the aura voice lines. I'd pay for that.
---
Why would you? Goons are already entrophying away, who is even the ‘head sky marshal’ for goons here days, some no-name, that’s who. Leave goons to rot in their own shit, it’s the best way to kill them as all their PVPers leave and quit.
---
How about rather than investing money into the next Dust or World of Darkness; CCP invest some cash into making non-instanced pve interesting, so people would want to do PVE.
---
Sorry.
---
Even if you restart the game all you'll do is transfer the existing alliances to a new game sure they'd start at square one but in a year or less you'd have the same map and same situation
---
Well yeah, CCP made the game more oriented around casual play, empire building, and PVE. 
---
Goons have been full of casual pubbies, empire builders, and pvers since at least the founding of GSF. Unless there’s a meta shift (there won’t be the game is on maintenance mode) then they’ve won

don't worry there will be other opportunities to unjam the f1 key

I have been smartbombed.  Twice.  Once was an incoming gate, so unavoidable.  The other time I was just an idiot:  "Why is there a shuttle on the incoming gate?", then warped direct to outgoing gate, and tried to cancel warp, but was too late and already in warp.  Was not surprised at all to see smartbomb BS at gate.
---
The Luxury Yacht is more smartbomb resistant, but a lot more expensive (hull + fittings).
---
also recons exist. Dscan immune.
---
Yeah, I'm not suggesting any of these changes so much as saying that this is a topic of discussion/concern in CCP, or was for two years before I joined the CSM and for the full year I was there.
---
As I said in another post, there's a faction of CCP devs that really want to massively nerf JFs and take EVE back to an era where escorting freighters was a thing. That said, given that jump ranges were reextended and that goofy change to jump bridges was added, this faction is probably much weaker now than it used to be.
---
For most of the history of the game there also wasn’t a station in every single system
---
pandemic legion has had a long history of attacking people "just for fun" and then insisting their victims buddy up with pl because it was just for fun, why are you upset, you're not cool if you don't buddy back up with us, and seems really genuinely shocked it had consequences
---
We rather watch from the sidelines
---
Mr. Vox,
---
I assure I am not affiliated with any of the groups in question but I am known by few, that I understand. When you receive information on a turn of events such as this one cannot help themselves but investigate!
---
I've been watching this strange relationship between RC and Provibloc for a couple of months now and i dare say its quite entertaining to watch. Here you have a primarily EU based Coalition fighting a USTZ coalition where both sides are basically at a standstill. I see the Provi-Bloc USTZ group trying to fight you all to not much effect of course, but the content is there and both sides seem to be content. But as time wears on im afraid that you are correct in the regard to legacy being "Fed Up" With Provi-Bloc. The recent timers involving test are a sure indicator that the wear and tear on provi-bloc as a whole is wearing down and they will probably join legacy, or at least a majority. Which is a shame because you have here two mostly independant groups hashing it out but things escalate sometimes to much it seems and external large alliances are called. So that would make Providence almost a proxy war of sorts. So in the end one side or the other will fall and join another super blob making eve less individualized. After that one side that isn't absorbed will fade into existence after being out matched by ten times their number.  
---
Also I couldn't get my old account to work so i made a new one and requested leniency, otherwise you cannot post if your account is brand new. I apologize I know it looks bad.

Panfam invaded CO2???

I see, The problem is that content was planned and an fc had already grinded a timer for everyone to go have fun. But Vily cancelled it. Thus, cancelling the content for test/legacy for the evening. When you post a stratop for a timer like this people make plans to attend it.   
---
The treason part is a high up leadership person in legacy is making deals with the enemy. That is "treason"  
---
It's the second time that he has made a deal with RC to save an asset from destruction. So there's many reasons that would be the case and i wonder which of those many reasons it is?

The germans atleast build an Atlantic wall. Panfam just grabs their shit and retreat like the french
---
Or you just know you are a coward in general. :D
---
Oh sorry, didn't know about that. Just saying that being risk-averse isn't strictly bot behavior, although I admit you're likely a much better judge at that than I am.
---
&gt; there were people from PL/NC asking for the very system that we have right now.
---
Yeah, uh, no. Almost nobody asked for skill injectors or rorquals or fozziesov
---
So? Even now when there is a citadel in every system, people still only keep their shit in their stagings.
---
I think you'd be appreciated more over in /r/starcitizen

lmao can confirm
---
Of course they hold the H6 Pipeline, And as any "head of the pipe" Alliance will tell you they will get a ton of abuse. The amount of attempts on sov in the H-6 Shintat area on the TRC Side are commendable at the very least.
---
BOB was heavily outnumbered by the NC and RSF even with the SC as allies and died to blobbing when their sov got dropped
---
Are we really forgetting that The Imperium abandoned 6 regions to move to Saranen during WWB?  
---
This isn't anything new in the game when you are outnumbered.
---
It was a good game i still play arma 3 every week though
---
If you are removing a feature that help players in small tasks you are REDUCING their quality of life. Do you work for EA or something?
---
Bless Jintaan. O7

And this is why eve  needs more instances because it's got like this and only a few control eve whilst new players dont have same chances
---
Your idea needs more work. Simply removing auto aggro would make using drone ships incredibly tedious.
---
Try playing through some sites with drones set to passive, its a chore not a 'slight' quality of life change.
---
So, there’s been an enormous increase in safety with no trade off for it. lmfao

TEST was forced to blue the Imperium when NCPL attacked Catch for a year and then PL launched the doomchinchilla.jpg eviction campaign with their entire supercap fleet after blueing up everyone who wasn't with Goons or TEST.

Oh Heavens, "free Icelandic vacations". How often have I heard that one. For the record, CCP pays for your flight, your (crappy) hotel room, transport to and from Keflavik airport, and one meal per day *if* you want to show up in their cafeteria to eat it. Every other expense is on the CSM member: transport to and from their home airport, other meals, probably necessary incidentals like SIM cards and the like, snacks, beer, etc. And Iceland is one of the most expensive countries around to eat in because a ton of stuff is imported.
---
I spent at *least* $500 on my three "free" trips to Iceland, not counting what I spent on gifts for and buying drinks for CCP devs (both of which were also substantial amounts). I didn't have to, and I'd do it again, but my wife and I made several dozen custom hoodies for EVE devs, I brought the maximum legal limit of booze (bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue for Unifex; bottle of a premium vodka he liked for Guard, to state two examples) and cigarettes with me (you wouldn't *believe* how many CCP devs smoke), often other gifts (baby gift for Punkturis, for example) and I made sure that no dev who was talking with me paid for their drinks. I also bought a bunch of bags of the salt licorice which is total catnip to Icelanders and had full bowls of it on the table for every summit session.
---
Again, I'm not complaining. I'd do it again. But those were some *expensive* free trips to Iceland, let me tell you. ;-)
---
For the answer to your question re: Goons influence on CCP, see my previous post -- search for "Klingons".
---
Nobody currently with CCP has contacted me about the AMA. I've heard from a surprising number of ex-CCP'ers, though!

So the bot program adds a single line that says... 'f'.

If you are dealing with an item where 0.01 ISK is an issue, it is a crap item.

I post my item, and if it doesn't sell after 3 days I adjust the price.

If it doesn't sell in another 3 days, it is a crap item.

Tip:  Check the number of units in sell orders vs. buy orders, and the typical daily volume.  If the supply is greater than demand, it is a crap item.

Hello join rvb

---
PL people were also in Delve at the time, mostly ISRAD with penif. TEST was the only one that did an alliance wide deployment to Aridia, so maybe that's what your alleging.
---
Regardless, people seem to think that the MBC was supposed to be longstanding defensive pact when it was never going to be more than a coalition of convenience. Once the IWI money ran out, it was never going to hold up. Three years on, we can comfortably look back and say "well they shouldn't have done that" but when Legacy was getting evicted the future was still uncertain.
---
Provi has been mostly independent for the entire lifespan of the game, and has faced far worse things than this. There is 0 chance that Provi-Bloc, or any of it's major groups that stuck through the PL invasion, will agree to join Legacy. That very simply will not happen.
---
The trouble with saying "this is a game It's OK to take risks" is that it completely ignores that the consequence of losing is tedium and time. PvE largely is just isn't fun and is the main way to come back from the gamble. Especially when during that pve you'd be risking as well, but with much lower chance of success. That's why the blocs exists, to significantly reduce the risk during pve. The problem though, is when the game incentivizes that risk aversion, it becomes global and reduces the chance to find others who risk. There's no tangible benefit to risking, but there are innumerable tangible downsides. 
---
Wormholes grant you higher isk returns for the much higher risk of playing in there. Both in pve and pvp rewards. There's not really anything like that actually *out* in nullsec space.
---
I had an AI listen to 40 hours of WingspanTT videos, and let it write it's own adventure story...
---
Its an interesting turnabout considering how much GSF/CFC tried to annihilate TEST from mid 2013 to early 2017 post-Fountain, and now they're allies. The old guard must be completely gone at this stage.
---
I am a nullbear.
---
5B and I will make you a nice propaganda poster out of this.
---
LOL
---
I agree that it is a QOL nerf.  I disagree with your estimate of the severity of it.
---
Gun and missile users have to hit F1 every time they shoot something else.  Is it really too much to expect drone users to hit F?
---
But they're not attempts when they work. TRC bats off CVA and "friends" regularly, while making moves against them with little resistance.
---
I'd also like to point out the PL alt narrative hadn't even reached far outside of providence, as YM is still mistaken as provibloc space that attracts naive new players right into HTP bubbles.
---
Sry I don’t bot
---
I have the Dell 34 inch, 1440p 120Hz... EVE is pretty good in Ultrawide and running two clients is ideal side by side. If you're running 4 clients or more though it's not quite as good.
---
If you're running just a single fullscreen client it is probably the best way to do so, you have extra room to jam more interface in or extra space uncluttered by interface. 
---
120Hz also feels great in eve, not going to give you much of a competitive edge but all that ship spinning feels super smooth.
---

You eradicate the desire to bot, because people are greedier than bots. Not going to ever solve it, but it makes people want to do things that are minmaxed
---
Yep. "...would only serve to make bots more sophisticated."
---
Slightly more than just F as there is some targeting involved.
---
Again it might stop the average Joe (that doesn't bot) from deploying his VNI alt army whilst watching Netflix.
---
wow
---
every time this gets posted, i have to post about the fact that non-drone ships also rely on drones auto aggro mechanics in certain pvp situations. Especially battleships.
---
Example: Battleship lock time is \~15s. You jump through a gate, you see a lach sitting at 0 on the gate. You can't the lock fast enough to start applying neuts/damage before it'll point you and then light a cyno. If you're quick enough, you decloak from gate cloak, launch your EC drones and as soon as the lach points/aggresses, the drones will automatically start trying to jam it, even with you having not finished locking the lach.
---
Also, outside of that example, you've already admitted bots would just adapt, so whats the point? It'll hurt other uses of the mechanic while bots will adapt and the change will be null/useless.
---
The holy grail.  Show us how.
---
I've never encountered someone so buttmad about not being handheld to a win...
---
Maybe provi should've nut up and attacked on their own?
---
Put it in the following categories:  
---
* Celestials  
---
* Sun  
---
* Cynos  
---
* Ships  
---
* Stations (NPC and player cits)
---
Anything else?
---
Well no attempts have been successful since you held the Shintaht system for example which TRC has held since 2018-05-25 and has held. There has been a few structure kills on both sides but thats the nature of the beast I suppose.
---
But muh narrative!

I don't know whether that's making fun of me or with me, but thank you kind human (I hope) nonetheless!
---
1. Fit auto-targeter in the highs
---
2. Add 'F' to the end of the script
---
All you've done is make ratting even more tedious for human players
---
The Gallente preach all that "freedom" but where has it got them? Citizens who identify as a Fedos and cry when they spill their own milk.
---
Yeah I get what you mean but I do think that's really naive. Goons have running off the same playbook for over a decade, I don't think you can truly kill an institution like that in the long run.
---
not in domain/amarr and south of it, gold as far as the eye can see.
---
Blah blah blah....bunch of assumptions and guesses with no real data or experiences. For all you know, all you see and hear about are the failed versions of bots (or chumps with a credit card) and the good ones are too good for us or CCP to detect. Honestly most of the bots I see are cloakies and explorers. Which at this point will require CCP to try and detect inorganic input, and I'm sure that's what they are trying to do. What else can you do? 
---
"Are you still playing?"
---
It sounds like you are confusing drones as a combat mechanic and the drone regions.  
---
Drones as a combat mechanic are a perfectly good tool of the trade for both pvp and pve.  In Eve, fleet level pvp things move in and out of meta on kind of like a slow meandering cycle.  A while back ishtars (the gallente drone focused HAC) was king.  Currently the meta at the fleet level has shifted away from drones but they are absolutely still used.  Especially in smaller scale pvp.  In PvE I'd say drones are probably the most used weapon type in EvE (over lasers, projectile, hybrid, missiles).  
---
The Drone REGIONS are made up of: Cobalt Edge, Etherium Reach, Kalevala Expanse, Malpais, Oasa, Outer Passage, Perrigen Falls, The Spire.  They are just a particular area of null and like the rest of null they have their positives and negatives.
---
Ok
---
Let's denote friendlies by red
---
Come to providence, there’s always someone trying to invade providence.
---
I trained Gallente because the Caldari Crow is harder to make warp in under 2s, and you also can't fit w-stabs like you can with Ares.
---
I mean, they don't even need to hit the 1. They'll still be the superior ratting ship.
---
Blue balls or Red rocket
---
Sorry I'll edit I'm talking purely about Drone regions
---

in a software arms race between ccp and bot programmers the its the playerbase that loses dev time. bot programmers will always find ways to keep up since its their irl income
---
Probably lost his hauler with 2 mill ISK worth of PI inside
---
No problem.  The drone regions are fine I guess.  A lot of renters live up there and it can be a fine place to go partake in some PvE.  Depending on how new you are I would not recommend moving to a corp in Drones though.
---
do you think a single POCO, to this date, has had 1 positive ISK in ROI yet? I would bet that 99.9% have not.
---
PGL welping 80 macharials and getting camped in for a week, and ultimately losing his, is hardly "following Goons into Delve". We were battle hardened all of us who made it to Delve, that was your mistake, we were all wanting more, more war more fighting, saranen is the best fun I've ever had in EvE. We WANTED to be followed.   
---
You may forget but I don't, we had been holding our own when not outnumbered 3 to 1 or more, people like Asher, Jay(gay4u), Thomas "The Faxwhisperer" Lear, DaBigRedBoat, all heroes. Taking and winning with huricanes against  fax supported battleships, how about sortdragon coming in with his 200 nightmares on a fight we are already outnumered 4 to 1, yeah I remember all of that so did his Imperial Highness, glory be to His Name. I remember TEST "hellcamping" too, smugging about us being "trapped" in saranen. Also remember how the valued allies stabbed TEST in the back.   
---
But Sort learned didn't he, I made it a point to tackle his Titan in X47 in my Nyx.   
---
Now NCdocked and and pets, sorry PL you no longer matter, are running, and you know what. I somehow doubt they will do as well as we did. Their elitist, lazy, whiney members have no stomach for an actual fight.   
---
Goons might be koolaid drinking F-1 monkeys, but we beat the most elite players in the game. Shame NCdocked has to cheat to get their money, if it isn't botting alts in rental space, it's casinos, buy a rorqual or two and get to work.
---
You have an interesting perspective on things and the only thing I would like to contribute to your interpretation is that while RekkingCrew and ProviBloc have obviously both batphoned external entities in the past, I would suggest that the ProviBloc batphone is made so that Legacy, Siege Green, Init, or others can handhold Provi to victory while RekkingCrew batphone is typically made to counter the ProviBloc batphone.
---
If both sides fight without any batphone, I would argue that RekkingCrew wins more often ( but I am biased :] ). As Rocket has mentioned in a comment elsewhere in this topic, if ProviBloc batphones but RekkingCrew does not, RekkingCrew gets rekt more often. Given ProviBloc's repeated tendency to batphone over even smaller content-generation structures, this has resulted in some sort of batphone arms-race.
---
I would like to point out that ProviBloc entirely stood down their stratop fleet upon realization that their Legacy handholders for this fight weren't coming. That would not have been the case if the roles were reversed -- even if a defensive batphone couldn't be arranged RekkingCrew would still have engaged to defend the structure.
---
Something something *players will optimize to the point of boredom* something something
---
People have mentioned it previously but make sure you're using the nullified interceptor for your race of choice -- combat ceptors (ones with weapons bonuses) were nerfed and can be bubbled now.
---
Ok, but BoB and MC were pretty dominant in spite of the numbers because:
---
(1) they were rich AF. Now we all fly pretty much the same ships with the same fits.  Back then the fact that BoB was using all T2 fits with rigs was a pretty big advantage.
---
(2) they had more SP.  Before injectors (and more importantly,  before everyone had 16 years to train moar skills) that was a big deal.
---
(3) they had better spies then everyone else, and we're better at the metagame.
---
(4) they had dev help.  My tin foil hat isn't thick enough to get into this, but I've always believed where there's smoke, there's fire.
---
The biggest difference between then and now is that the tools exist to overcome all the advantages BoB had.  Everyone has the same access to isk. Injectors are a thing.  The CSM was put in place exactly because of the accusations of devs helping BoB.
---
So I don't think people who didn't play back then really understand what dominance really is. 
---
Also, the timing is important here.  Once BoB and MC split, that was kinda the beginning of the end.  The GBC pilots that replaced MC weren't as skilled, and didn't have as much Isk, and it showed on fleets.
---
I actually thought your story was pretty endearing but it's R/EVE so one must maintain a certain level of professional assholery.

Wormholes are different than Kspace in a few ways, but change a lot! 
---
Always bookmark your entrance, so you can find your way out.
---
The sites are also different from Kspace, and if you can find the data/relic you are used to in lower Wh class, they are mostly dangerous. Don't hesitate to Google the name of the site before running them. Same for gas/ore signature.
---
And obviously spam your dscan. Their is no working local, so it's plenty of cloaky hunters. Always assume someone is watching you, have already the scanned the system you are in, and is watching you waiting for the best opportunity to blow you.
---
Oh, and stay cloaked as long as you can!
---
My primary counterargument here is that "something" will almost certainly include another major nerf to titans. This will kneecap the Imperium's major advantage over other power blocs. 
---
The other (highly likely) scenario involves a war with Legacy and simultaneous internal collapse. You already see elements of the second option (Space Violence leaving, Snuffed Out leaving, lots of PvP/combat pilots seeking homes with more serious content options). Obviously, this isn't a balance issue, so it could be averted, but it means it's silly to suggest the Imperium is permanently invulnerable to any sort of defeat.
---
KYS. This way you arrive back home. Just right click on your pod and choose self destruct. If you have implants you will lose them otherwise its a quick free trip back to known space. Also, if you warp to anything and you don't know what it is google it first as WH space is dangerous.

You hold one contrived marginal situation where you're pretty much poked anyway as a counter point?  Run back to the gate dude...

But yes.  It is a QOL nerf.  And yes, bots will just get more sophisticated.

Lol,.. well I haven't played since 2016.  And, the last of my days playing then involved a bit binge drinking of which I don't drink anymore.  TBH, I don't even remember buying a Minokawa but apparently I have one.

So, I just enabled an omega clone and am seeing where things are at as I have like 5-8 capitals lying around, faction battleships and a ton of other combat ships and sometimes they are 40 jumps apart.  At my best, I was running 4 accounts, 3 of which were combat (2 capital) and another whom did jump freighter stuff.  Have to enable more accounts to get the BLOPS going again or to start jumping a viator around (you can still jump viators using BLOPS  right?).

Yeah. And I just remembered this: we were also told that CCP had done some group studies and this "mechanical focus" that EVE had, the focus on a spaceship, was a big reason why the player base was so heavily male.
---
yeah im not gonna spend time to haul all those injectors from deep null to perimeter every month. CCP can do that
---
&gt; sure but do you really think a small group should be able to beat what you just described?
---
In SkillU's home area? No. Somewhere 20 jumps away, though, when the small group's staged there? Yes, it would be much better if deploying big fleets was more difficult so locality matters.
---
Some of you people are so fucking dumb, it hurts.
---
This is a really nifty story! I occasionally hear about people turning their EVE skills into ways to improve their non-EVE lives and they always make me smile.
---
Alright, I'll accept your explanation and admit I've misattributed your identity to be that of a provi bloc member. Apologies for the sass directed your way. I feel that the statement about provi in general definitely stands though.
---
Step 1. Pull goon cock and balls out of Villy’s, Sorts and whoever runs Inits mouths. 
---
Step 2. Help those same people find their own cock and balls.
---
Does everyone think they are actually invincible? Eve killed an Alliance that had CCP devs cheating to help them we can take a regular bunch of them no?
---
In person with spuddy lol
---
Yep, the problem is the concept of the umbrella and being able to project that coalition fleet power anywhere in the cluster.
---
These all sound like really cool features, but they also sound like it would be easier for them to make a new game from scratch than to change eve with at least a good number of these.
---
Fuck all. We're here to ruin **YOUR** game. Get fucked!
---
Perhaps a noob-question, but:
---
Allmost every Bot (VNI's, carriers, supers) i have seen until now uses the drone mechanics to operate. Would it help to, for example, just remove auto-aggro from drones or completly overhaul the drone / fighter mechanics?
---
I drew some stupid space pixels and charged myself $3000 for it, does that count ?
---
That seems workable.
---
Yeah, after I lost the first one I bought a claw (as it was cheap with 4 low slots) thinking I could set it up to align fast.  Hopped into l4x. which has like 20 large bubbles on the gate, couldn't warp, luckily no gate camp, went back to station and looked at the interceptor bonuses and learned that.  Anyone want a claw?  I don't have a single saved fitting for one.
---
you'll play YOUR game alone soon
---
Serious question you realize that by ruining Eve you are ruining the Goons as well no?
---
Kinda crude but the first thing that came to mind.
---
Dude that was ten years ago. TEN YEARS.
---
Think of all the ways the world has changed in ten years. Gamers aren't the same. It requires different pressure points.
---
"Dirty Belts"... So, you choose to be behind in weapons race?
---
Then, there is not excuse. You choose to be in this situation... :/
---
This is 100% accurate, literally nothing you can think if will hurt botters without also hurting real players, because its a plain and simple fact that anything a Player can do at the end of the day boils down to simple inputs, be they keyboard or mouse, and a bot can input those just as easily as a human, if not better.
---
So taking steps like this hurts the real players by making their life hell, meanwhile the bot could not care less what stupid hoops you make it have to go through it's going to go through them effortlessly regardless, the only effort would be on the programmers side, and as a Programmer I can tell you nothing you have said would be a challenge for a decent coder.
---
We need a solution that's out of game, something like an Anti cheat system, have ccp hire some staff to actively get and reverse engineer the popular bots and then use that data to fine tune a detection system and plug it into the game, it's always going to be reactionary but patching the detection system could be a lot easier and faster, done more regularly to keep the bot numbers down.
---
This will never be a fight where eradication is a choice, rather its a fight to keep their numbers down so low they have little impact, and they can only really do that with active tools.
---
Stop trying to change the game to hurt bots, your only going to hurt us players instead.
---
From the perspective of someone on the ground of RCs side, I see and hear about CVA bitching out from engagements regularly. I've heard people say CVA members are warned off from engaging with our roams until they can organize a dozen t2 cruisers to fight off a bunch of kitchen sink frigates and destroyers. If they're so risk averse then I suppose that just means we're given more chances to flex on them which makes the head-up-their-ass pseudo racist LARPing angle all the funnier.
---
That being said, I don't want CVA to dissolve since their continued attempts to portray the region as newbie-safe is the main source of easy kills we have in YM. Going through TRCs training program, those kills were the most profitable thing I could do with my time for a while.
---
Join them
---
fit up a malediction -- they go zoomy and can be made to instawarp
---
NC and PL? Yeah.
---
I remember seeing that as well. Are travel 'ceptors better than shuttles for traveling? With my low SP ive just been using shuttles to travel when I need to go long distances w/o cargo space.
---
Did Eve players become a bunch of pussies who no longer can do anything other than purr on command when Mittens tells them to?
---
I'm sorry mere words bring you pain. Would you like some spod to fill that void?
---
So i would love to see the stats between botters banned if they are primarily alpha or omega.
---
If we find out they are alpha accounts we could have some fun
---
Made it so alpha accounts don't generate anything to ADMs
---
Make it so alpha accounts don't generate tax
---
Alpha accounts can only hold a certain about of isk + cannot be transferred
---
Alpha accounts can only accept trades / contracts but cannot make them
---
Lock heavy drones behind omega
---
After all alpha accounts are just supposed to be a way of getting into the game
---
\*any standings should cost a fee.
---
im sure theres plenty of spod in your head :p
---
&gt;Villy
---
Who is this fam?
---
My favorite bit was the provi guy in ym local who said something to the effect of "when I asked why we don't anti-pirate patrol up to y-mp, which is 3 jumps from our staging, I was told 'not in our patrol route'" XD
---
I convert it to isk and then invest it into the market. I could just release the names of all the goons who have bought officer mods from me the last several months. I appreciate the patronage though.
---
portraitpack 2.0 incoming
---
I don't want to.
---
I was always worried I'd slip up and send a furniture company freight  rates for super caps or something.
---
Simple Idea: Remove Aggressive Drone Setting.
---
Done, I fixed Eve.
---
Soon goons going to crush NCPL up north, no matter how many times they will crush them, they will never kill them, why ? Because you can't kill an alliance by just bashing their structure, forcing them to dock, stop their pve for few month.
---
Look how long Co2 survive after what The Judge did, after how long GSF farm them, after how many region they lost, after how many times their leader was ban.
---
If that what you call pussy well
---
Probably, but it does seems to work for things like Duo Nebulae. It really depends on how the different systems are written.
---
You forget the fact that pl is more like the old goons than goons are now though, todays goons are more like bob
---
The "we're here to ruin your game" goons have moved on, and even your ex leader left because of that
---
Standings doesn't matter, 9/10 pvpers in eve only shoots broadcasts
---
We ask CCP to charge isk for standings and make that a monthly charge to create an isk sink, combat inflation and make those standings increase exponentially for the number of people in said alliance or crop.
---
So you just proved the above point, you were in TEST for like a day, because you actually don't have a clue.
---
While DHD is a loud, abrasive, sperg-lord, he is a smart mother fucker, and if he tells you you are being stupid you most likely are.
---
On the contrary I think everyone else should be willing to fight it out for all the marbles. I want the Imperium to die as in the Coalition I don't have a problem with the Goons exsiting as long as there is a way to fight them.
---
*all standings
---
Imagine the frustration when one alliance doesn't want to pay for standings and there's a large brawl.
---
Except I linked a video of me killing bots, and you can see by my killboard I did it for around a 2 month period in 2018, and have been on the CSM and discussed with CCP the impact of botting over the course of 3 years.
---
But hey. What do I know?
---
People suggesting to assess any sort of penalty for setting any kind of standings are sorely lacking in their Eve history knowledge.
---
Back before there were standings at all, we in Goonfleet pioneered what was called the Portrait Pack. The Eve client caches player portraits locally so it doesn't have to call out to a remote server every time someone talks in chat. It's a pretty trivial task to replace that image with whatever you want. For example, you could draw a blue square on the portrait for friendly players, and a red square for any hostiles you've enumerated. You could also accept bribes from your corpmates to make The Mittani's portrait a penis. The possibilities are endless.
---
Removing standings only means that those of us with a little computer savvy retain the mechanic, while everyone else loses it. Never forget that CCP added the standings mechanic to level the playing field.
---
I was pretty sure you could remotely exact. Aka extractors in jita, pilot in null Station
---
Why don't you guys remake MBC ? I trough that coalition was only made because you guys hated goons ? Where is your hate that put you all together ? Did it left the same time as IWI was ban for RMT ?
---
You still wouldn't shoot them, you don't just randlomy pick targets
---
Also in every major battle you usually have only red overview
---
Well that freedom got them hentai.
---
im all for it, but id also suggest that it does not require any skills to anchor and is automatically created when a ship is destroyed. also with an absolutely hilarious meme for a name
---
Why is it such a big deal to prevent alphas from using the VNI/Domis/Scorps/Gilas - all faction, specifically? 
---
I don't see why that's even an option for that level of character in the first place.
---
Advantage: higher bounties on rats (but they don't drop loot -- unless they're a faction rat)
---
Disadvantage: logistics is a nightmare and the markets aren't great. So if you want a specific ship or mod, you're either waiting a few days for a jump freighter run, or you're risking a trip to high sec. Some corps are better about this than others.
---
Disadvantage: constant cloaky camping, frequently your whole existence is sitting in a station while you're incompetent overlords moral post.
---
Advantage: corps in the drone lands are pretty independent, leads to a very close family feel.
---
Disadvantage: corps in the drone lands are pretty independent, they have a great deal of trouble coordinating to do anything. Lots of beef between corps, allies that often despise each other.
---
\&gt;guys no big fight tonight sorry test changed their minds.
---
\&gt;I'll still keep fighting
---
???
---
Do tell how a scrammed/pointed battleship is making it back to gate (that isn't a nightmare) in any reasonable time before a cyno drops.  
---
also, i've had this exact scenario play out in my favor before. Ask Verge of Collapse guys in molden heath.
---
You could wipe out every titan goons had. Disband their corps from the inside and due to their culture they would still be flying rifters and drakes to battle.
---
The reason goons are big is because their alliance is based on an outside group that cant be shaken.
---
Of course a of goons pets are super vulnerable. As soon as the going got tough goons would be alone.
---
A thought out reply. Thank you for your input. I'm simply trying to suggest options for possible solutions to mega coalitions. The big blue bagel needs to die.
---
The funny thing is, you think I'm complaining because I'm not getting the reward. I'm still on track to get it if I don't miss any other days. I'm advocating this for other people, because unlike you, I'm not an asshole who thinks he's better than everyone else for being able to log in to a video game every day and click a button like a good little monkey.
---
A shuttle will be of little use if you hit a warp disruptor bubble.
---
Travel 'ceptors are immune to those.
---
I don't hate the Goons I just feel their coalition is overbearing.
---
The only time KYS! isn't offensive! haha
---
There's absolutely a world where we'd be fighting goons right now.  NC/PL did literally everything they could to prevent that.
---
motherFUCKER have you not undocked since 201-whenever? ARE YOU NOT SEEING THE PAGES AND PAGES OF UPWELL-GARBAGE ON YOUR OVERVIEW?
---
nvm this is probably some extreme meta crypto-level trolling going on
---
1m is more SP than was given out for serious server issues or even the summer of rage. It's not an insignificant reward. It's two weeks of free training. It's over 2b in injectors. For my toons over 80m sp, it's something insane like 4b free isk. They could extend it for those who have real lives. I'm advocating for others, not myself. I'm on track to get it. You are just short-sighted.
---
Don't count on CCP.
---
EVE didn't kill bob, director betrayal did.
---
Well, no. I mean, people have beat back the Goons plenty of times before. But they always come back, because they've figured out how to just have fun playing, win where possible, and to handle the losses in stride.
---
Imperium is basically a bunch of core people and a whole load of people joined merely for safest krab. If you denied them krabbing for about 6 months you'd see it bleed and trim to 10k members.
---
The best way to deny krabbing to an alliance is bringing a larger capital force to their range. That's impossible by definition for Imperium. For guerilla tactics, you'd need literally thousands of people willing to spend time and money specifically for that purpose. They need to be relentless vets. If you bring noobs and get them station gamed they'll get bored and whiney
---
Would killing of enough pets amke the core Goons manageable still a threat but not OP?
---
Everyone says they killed bots and always has irrefutable proof. But that isn't proof, it's just an educated guess and assumptions, only CCP and the end user knows if they are botting. Hence why players trying to combat botting will never work.
---
You vastly underestimate the ability of Goons to entertain themselves in the absence of anything else to do.
---
They know how to play the meta they just don't want to, their identities are too fragile.
---
Buyout CCP
---
There isn't Undead Band of Brothers or Band of Brothers 2 no?
---
coming from an alliance with almost 3k POCOS at peak times i can tell you some have  
---
most havent tho, overall it has but only if you defend them long term
---
Would shoot blue at anytime
---
I bet RMT Shady Corp. won't sell CCP for 600 mil isk.
---
:spins up another alt:
---
&gt;Also every other claim you make about my mental health reflects on you.
---
Not really - I'm just saying it looks like a skunk, smells like a skunk, so it's most likely a skunk.
---
No doubt it happens.  Even with drone aggro the way it is you die in the vast majority of situations anyway.  
---
Of course for every one of those scenarios that actually happen there are probably a 10000 AFK VNI's
---
Since you are dealing in marginal situations as proof... I made it back to gates in non nightmare BS's plenty of times...
---
But peace dude.  Only suggestion.  And obviously some guys would attribute more weight to some of the consequences than others.
---
A pretty good post, the whole recent discussion about botting has been really interesting to see. I like idea shifting the reward from ISK ticks to loot, because then at least it makes hunting the bots rewarding as you say. 
---
One thing I'd like to add is from a bit of my own personal work - I've recently been doing some research on Malware about detecting whether there is a human user or not. The detection works exclusively off of mouse positions, times, and whether they click. I would think that a similar thing could be easy-ish for CCP to implement, as it would just require a rolling list of the last 100 or 200 mouse positions whilst in the game window. From this you can extract a load of features, and of there are a few that can nicely classify bot from human activity.
---
Some kind of change to detect how a bot is interacting with the client, rather than changing the ingame behavior might help to better differentiate the two.
---
Vily is working with us, fear not.

Rogue drone rats used to drop drone alloy instead of paying off bounty, which made drone region very good for farming t1 minerals and build capital ships

Depends on who you are. If your aryth or the imperium it's hundreds or thousands of trillions. If your NC docked it's not that much.
---
Maybe?
---
You mean Eric Crap ton or who?
---
&gt; Villlllllllll**l**y
---
Tree fiddy is gud money
---
I mean I can plex my accounts for 10 years and still have isk left over....so how much is a shit load of isk for you.
---
I think it depends on your personal level of isk making what you think. When I started playing it was a struggle to get a million isk so I would have said 200+ million isk is a crap ton. Now a billion isk is a few hours on a weekend so I’d say to me now 100B sounds like a crap ton
---
In the video you linked, how can you tell the difference between a bot and a traumatized, risk adverse newbro krabbing up trying to get into a bigger ship unless CCP checks how long the character has been logged in on a 24 hour basis?
---
:)
---
I think you greatly underestimate how much a quadrillion (a thousand trillions) isk is. I know Aryth is rich but I highly doubt he is that rich. (Even a hundred trillion is a giant amount of isk btw)
---
Perimeter yes, Jita no.
---
Out of concerns for spam, Jita will be specifically exempt.
---
What is happening right now is goons are taking over all of the other geoups who oppose them. Instead of all the smaller groups uniting against goons and thinking for their future they are looking only for the short term and siding with goons. What will eventually happen is that no group can be independent anymore without goons having influence on them whether they like it or not. So when i hear things like big groups are taking over i say its your own fault because you wanted a safe space to play instead of fighting for your own (group’s) independence. After this war between Panfam and Goons (which goons will win most likely) say adios to any other group being able to stand against them in the slightest. Every group will become a “goon pet” and can loose space and standing at any moment. Oh and they will have to pay ransoms to have goons leave them alone. Like GOTG. We all see how that turned out... lol
---
I remember the first time I made "crap ton" of isk in my eyes. It was an implant from a low sec faction frig. 400m. That was in 2009.
---
Yes
---
best idea so far
---
I never said I was better than anyone for logging into a game but alright. I don't think we should advocate for bullshit like this because CCP could literally give a week of catch up time and people would still bitch about the fact that they missed it. It's fucking dumb. Someone is always going to cry that they missed out on a times event. Does that mean you shouldn't do timed events? Fuck no. It makes stats look better for the company and the players get something out of it.

As a logi pilot myself, it'd be convenient to be able to watchlist the entire fleet, but with things as they are now there is an opportunity to demonstrate mastery by knowing to watchlist the priority targets. I would be disappointed to see that skillcap lowered even though increasing the watchlist size would make my life easier.

U can meet other players quicker, that way.

Go into the wormhole, scan down and bookmark all the interesting stuff and then go back home and get a ship suitable to run the stuff that interests you. Like a venture to mine or a cruiser to try some combat.

&gt; Yes, it would be much better if deploying big fleets was more difficult so locality matters.
---
People hated jump fatigue so it got nerfed into the ground.
---
you spent months doing the same thing with marshy in delve.... pot meet kettle?
---
If your idea actually changed something, it would be fine. But you yourself already admitted that bots would just adapt or get more complex to compensate. So what you're suggesting is nerfing already useful mechanics (no matter how marginal) to actual players, just to effect botting VNI's that would have 0 effect as you've already stated they would adapt. Those "marginal" situations are tactics used by more experienced players to get out of stacked odds. What if you're running from a blob and an inty is chasing you, i can throw EC drones faster than i can lock an interceptor and i can't burn back to gate because of the blob. That is a very normal situation for any battleship in small gang/solo roams.
---
Nerfing drone aggro changes nothing to how bots will act, the only thing it will do is nerf pvp situations and pve situations where the players are actually active. The bots will continue botting. You would want to focus on the actual anoms and change them to effect bot behavior and make it harder to afk bot/rat. Or at least introduce mechanics that make it harder for the bot to just warp off whenever something hostile appears (such as more pointing npcs or a point tower).
---
I've got a 3440x1440 34" UW and running EVE on it is ... awkward.  It can look beautiful.  Just look at this sexiness:
---
https://i.imgur.com/ELzYzCp.jpg  
---
https://i.imgur.com/91M4WGf.jpg  
---
https://i.imgur.com/6a4RKxY.jpg  
---
https://i.imgur.com/8agh6P0.jpg  
---
But it can also be quite awkward.  And here's why.
---
In EVE, unless you're just a meaningless F1 monkey, there's so much information you need to take in.  And I thought the monitor would be great for EVE as it would allow me to show all that information on the screen at once, instead of having to shrink windows and scroll, or dock them together and switch between the tabs.
---
But it's impossible to focus on the entirety of an UW all at once; most of the screen will sit in your peripheral vision.  So I found myself setting up my overview such that the important information is clustered into the top right-of-middle, roughly into the area of a 1080p monitor, with with slightly less essential information either side of it, and then the even less essential information all the way to the edge, I can focus my attention to the part of the monitor with the important information on it, and then glance at the rest when needed.
---
This is how my overview has ended up (note that I often minimise the public channel cluster and replace with fleet-specific channels, such as scout, logi or intel channels):
---
https://i.imgur.com/YZjqJNJ.jpg  
---
https://i.imgur.com/Jz6W05o.jpg  
---
https://i.imgur.com/BgTz0om.jpg  
---
Note that the gaps in the top and bottom right are reserved for EVE-O Preview.  Roller alts (four of them) will go in the bottom right, while my main and tackle alt go in the top right.  It just so happens that, in those three images, I didn't have EVE-O Preview up.
---
You'll figure out how to best setup your overview, based on your needs.
---
Also, having a second monitor would also be a huge benefit, even with a UW.  While you can easily fit two clients side by side on a 34" UW, each taking 50% of the width, as I do with my roller alts, but it still doesn't beat two characters on two screens.  If I had the desk space, I'd probably grab a 24" 1080p monitor and put it vertically to the side of my monitor.  But I don't, so I make do with what I've got
---
The only people then can kill goons are goon recruiters.

Goonswarm is a group of HIV positive individuals from the popular gay hookup site, somethingawful.com

400m was probably worth a lot more in 2009 too! I’m only a year old and I’ve already seen a bit of inflation just in that time.
---
and there are better ways to do that than removing mechanics/tactics from non-drone ships or punishing actual active players.

I think it was near enough to PLEX around that time. Funny story is that I mistakenly bought a shuttle to fly to Jita for 150m. When I went to buy some ships in Jita I realized my mistake.

Given how old the game is now, pretty much everybody has both flown with and fought against everybody else at some point in their internet spaceships career ... With the exception of CO2, who don't exist anymore it's almost impossible to get an impartial answer to your question ... Personally I think all alliances and coalitions are all as good/bad as each other. There's no Captain Honourable in this New Eden!
---
it's not me
---

---
The thing you're forgetting is that "Mega-coalitions" as you put it, are not a problem to be solved. Eve is and should be a sandbox. CCP doesn't need to fix them because they are not broken. Some people may be sad about them existing, or feel like they are a problem, but welcome to the real world. There is nothing CCP can do from a mechanic standpoint to limit people grouping into Mega-coalitions that won't also effect smaller groups from functioning. We built these coalitions so we could have continued success, and it is exactly what would happen if we weren't talking about a video game right now and instead talking about some future where humans did conquer the stars.
---
&gt;I genuinely think that after this war is over, the Imperium will help Legacy take out Winterco once and for all
---
I sincerely doubt we will help Legacy against WinterCo. Maybe for some important timer or structure like UALX. We only work together when PanFam is involved. With Legacy taking Mango under their wing I doubt they would even need our help.
---
PHorde will likely remain intact after the war. Their morale and cohesiveness is strong enough to survive most anything tbh and we're not invading geminate. Some fresh faces will likely pop up in Tribute or another entity will expand into the region. The bot lands hopefully (fingers crossed) will see some new non-rental faces.
---
GotG (DeadCo) still exists and are becoming quite the economic powerhouse themselves. Especially after the whole Slyce incident I have no love for them and doubt many of my fellow goons do either.
---
Despite all the doom and gloom/ reee eve is dead, this little galaxy of ours will keep spinning even if NCPL somehow manage to die. Even them dying is doubtful imo. And that's all assuming we win. PanFam still has enough oomph to capitalize on mistakes. Despite the koolaid some people drink, the reality is these people against PanFam are not allies. Much like MBC, they just want to see a specific someone get kicked in the teeth.
---
Literally i asset safetied my super rather than deal with tony delacourt.  Realized how toxic goons were was why I won eve in the first place.
---
The problem is the rampant apathy in Eve.
---
Last time there was somebody footing the bill as incentive.
---
That Gate Gun one for Faction War is actually a pretty great suggestion.
---
thats racist
---
Same
---
Even that approach I think wouldn't work now ... The likes of NCPL have been dropping dreads in Delve since Goons moved in and they've not even batted an eyelid.
---
Ouch. Contract scam? Luckily I haven’t fallen for a scam yet, but it’ll happen :)
---
Except that doesn't fit the lore. It's supposed to lead back to Earth. But it either collapsed, meaning it's impossible to get back there. Or the gravity blah blah and the radiation and whatever, is actually coming through from Earth. Which means we can't go back b/c it's a cosmic nightmare over here for some reason.
---
So if you could manage to get into it, you'd either die, or die. =)
---
The issue is less untrustworthiness, more the arrogance shown in the past when they were at the top of the food chain.
---
The narative may change from time to time, but all big alliances have some dirt under their carpets. Some just spin it better than others.
---
Fucking participation trophy kids.

Next thing we know someone will ask to add asset safety to wormholes

Actually it was the only shuttle for sale in the station via the market. I was in such a hurry that I saw 150k and not 150m. I've learned from that mistake :P

It's supposed to lead back to Earth. But it either collapsed into radiation and gravity blah blah, or all that stuff is coming through from the other side. Either way, the only thing on the other side is cosmic nightmares and death.
---
Forget the AOE damage. Make it interactable, "enter wormhole" is fine. Entering the wormhole not only destroys your ship, it kills your pod too. Thats what you get for thinking Eve has a story.
---
Everything you just said is wrong :)

Wingspan TT and Lasker Emanuel are my go to for Eve videos.

Good to see new people enjoying the game.

&gt; May I make autopilot warp to 0 now without getting banned? Since they don't ban human VNI AFK farmer.

That's client modification though, which is a perma-ban.

I'd be ok with that too

It’s what you make of it. I’ve been drifting around solo in a Naglfar and I haven’t logged in all week. :)

it's a tool from 2012, before it i used to do like you did. i just looked at the old forum post and it's apparently not being updated anymore though
---
it just saved a few clicks for every item you were updating, you would click a button to let it know if you were selling or buying and from there you would go through your list of items and click export to file on each. it would grab the most recent buy, copy the value +/- some value

&gt;Adjusting an order took me 14 actions:
---
&gt;Double click order, select lowest sell order, copy, select spreadsheet, paste, select highest buy order, copy, select spreadsheet, paste, copy new price, right click order, click modify order, paste, hit OK.
---
14 ******* flowering actions.
---
&gt;I'm lazy!
---
&gt;This was my motivation to program Elinor.
---
So. What does it do?
---
&gt;As soon as you click "Export to file" in the lower section of the market window, Elinor omnomnoms the data and produces the same ratios my spreadsheet did. Optionally, she copies the sell or buy price to your clipboard (with magic) so you can instantly paste them into the "Modify order" dialog in Eve without even leaving the client. For added convenience you can pin her atop of the Eve client so you can always have the sweet sweet data within your sight.
---
&gt;What did this do to my needed actions:
---
&gt;Double click order, click "Export to file", right click order, click modify order, paste, hit OK.
---
6 actions. (Because I'm lazy as hell, I programmed my keyboard to Ctrl-A, Ctrl-V, Enter with one action. Did I mention I'm lazy?)
---
Of all the nullsec regions, Drone Regions is not one I'd choose to live in ... Most of it is quite far away from High/Low sec which makes logistics a pain in the arse, getting anything in or out is going to be difficult/expensive/both.
---
Another note is that all other pirate factions have much more defined damage types that they deal and are resistant to. For example, Blood Raiders deal only EM &amp; Thermal damage which they are also most vulnerable to. This makes ratting much more efficient ... Drones are the most omni of them all so if you plan to make your ISK there by ratting your ISK efficiency will suffer for it.
---
Someone once said this to me and it's quite accurate ... Drone Lands are like Siberia, cold, desolate and full of Russians!

It's not Eve.  It's you.  Don't expect things to change unless you make changes.

Just to be pedantic it leads back to the Canopus system. But otherwise yeah.

Before it was super easy to get your stuff out for free, with a few exceptions, and now there is a 15% isk sink put on it.

cant you just accept that your whole idea is a brainfart and stop posting?

They didn't grow huge for no reason. You would need to keep them under control all the time to keep them from growing big again.
---
With order highlighting and double clicking on the wallet orders to bring up the market data I feel like I can update all my orders in all of a few minutes. I run a triple monitor setup and have no life so I can constantly stay on top of all my market orders. If I'm playing other games I keep my station trading toons up on the other monitors to update orders during down times/loading screens/queues ect ect
---
NCPL were dreadbombing Rorquals as a secondary source of content. They didn't commit to denying farm in Delve. Goons then proliferated enough FAXes to keep the counterdropping titans and supers alive, at which point NCPL stopped dreadbombing.
---
You need to get more creative these days to kill stuff in Delve. NCPL back then didn't rely on that kind of creativity. That's why we were the ones who killed a titan under the Delve umbrella after over 1.5 years. 
---
Now, if you mix that creativity with numbers as large as the entire north (NC, PL, Horde, even BL, etc), you might reach a critical mass that can make it really unpleasant to farm in Delve. Then again, most people in these alliances are there for content and killmails. Denying farm by definition isn't fun after a certain point. So keeping them in the same region for months is a problem.
---
All this shows, all in all, how easy the krabbing-based alliances have it compared to militaristic alliances that care less about PvE. If you're willing to krab the shit out of a region as the owner of the largest umbrella, there isn't much anyone can do.
---
I just had a nerdgasm
---
Probably human instinct - safety in numbers, so blob up and  don't break the status quo.
---
I mean.. everyone knows goons just has numbers and no skills .. numbers win wars... NC PL is outnumbered so why do the dumb thing and feed? Goons will get bored and go back doing what they do elsewhere ..
---
So so show me this post Where panfam said that?

&gt; Creation of tight physical battlefield chokepoints that limit forces beyond a certain size

So we have to fight in a giant space tube or something?

You don't notice it because of the graphics, but EVE is a very simple game as far as gameplay goes. Most of the work is done in the fitting window. Think about how often you actually perform an action. You warp to something with a click, then wait while you're "flying" to destination. You click to lock something. Now you have a few decisions as far as modules. 
---
Ratting is even simpler. 
---
Undock. one click
---
Warp to anomaly. two clicks
---
Activate tank. three to 5 clicks
---
Orbit object.  four to six clicks
---
Drop drones.  five to seven clicks
---
Afterburner on. six to eight clicks
---
Finish site, pull drones, and the cycle starts over. Other than that, it only needs to watch local to warp to a safe or citadel.
---
So to run a vni bot, it only needs to perform a handful of actions to bring in a billion + isk per day. 
---
Most of EVE gameplay is just rarely performing an action and waiting for the next thing to do. Other games you have to constantly move yourself and you can get stuck on obstacles or fall or a million other things.
---
&gt;This is easily bottable. I don't think it slows any process for bots more than it slows real player farming.
---
I agree, maybe making the loot all of the value so it can be stolen would work better than one final boss. They will simply come back and finish the site after the hunters leave system and collect.
---
&gt; they chose to nerf the reward instead of making it riskier.
---
That is not true, look at the NSA change for carriers/supers.
---
I see your point, if all of panfam and friends fully committed to stopping PvE in Delve, dropping on anything that moved. Goons would suffer for it greatly. The catch 22 of that would be the cost for panfam. They'd have to fully deploy away from the north and within a fortnight they'd have lost it completely. 
---
It's a double edged sword methinks.
---
i mean ill take some :)
---
Amamake to Huola to Kamela area of the minmil/amarrmil lowsec Faction Warfare zone
---
Goons are unlikely to obliterate Panfam ... on purpose.  They know that path leads to boredom.
---
However, it appears it might be possible Panfam might defeat themselves, which would be the same path.
---
That could then open the field for another power to rise.
---
Not without adequate reason, no, I can't
---
Of course I can be flippant and say:
---
can't you just accept my whole idea is brilliant bow down and shower me with gifts?
---
Are you stupid or something?
---
I've put forward a gain to be had, you advanced no counter argument to that... how about addressing that?
---
Do the tutorial missions, they introduce you to some of the basic PvE activities in the game and help familiarize you with the complex UI. When you don't understand an item or mechanic, look it up on the [Uni Wiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page) - a player-run compendium of game knowledge.
---
oh no you di int
---
I hate to ruin a good narrative but I'm not sure we actually want to finish Fraternity off.
---
Yeah, we like fighting them. Yeah, sometimes it gets pretty heated. But ultimately we need a hostile neighbor of competitive size, and I think Sappo/Dran/Vily/PGL know that.
---
HEYYOO!!!  Ill be there!!  Anything i should bring? (yes yes...i shall bring swag for the auctions)
---
Be that as it may... There was a subtle difference. I agree 100% about CCP (or an employee, rather) giving BoB an unfair advantage.
---
But whether due to insight, coincidence or luck, there were a lot more smaller alliances and big corporations who lived next to each other, trying to get the upper hand and blowing shit up. And again, the current situation is *probably* a result of human instinct (safety in numbers), but it's absolute death for the game.
---
Instead of 100 little fiefdoms vying for control, you've got 2 or 3 massive cesspool coalitions sitting safely, because why the fuck do something, since resources are everywhere for everyone at all times.
---
No renter landlord is dropping supers to protect their renters from roaming gangs. The point is that defenders have too many advantages to make roaming anything other than a waste of time, no matter who is in charge of the space you're roaming.
---
You can be kind *and* correct at the same time.
---
Imagine the possibilities:
---
"Get a Corvette starter-package for only $1"
---
people allready gave them to you, youre just too ignorant to accept you had a brainfart  
---
i hate how CCP handles stuff these days but im happy braindead mongs like you are not in charge
---
grr goons tho
---
The only thing I see potentially affecting Goons is the big influx of Chinese players and a Chinese alliance.
---
However they'l talke at least a year or 2 to build up a capital/titan fleet and money to have any impact.
---
So really unless goons implode nothing will stop then.
---
People have been repeating the whole PL don't do PVE, PL only care about green killboards memes for so long that they actually believe it.
---
Reality doesn't enter into the equation
---
It uses evemarketer.
---
No, but imagine fighting in an asteroid field where asteroids actually block your shots. Or an anomaly with hazardous gas clouds that deal massive damage directly to your hull. Navigating through small openings would limit effective fleet scaling.
---
The NSA change is actually a yield nerf. People fitted sensor boosters instead of the NSA. And were fighter tracking modules in those midslots. 
---
Nsa change is pretty recent too. If you look at last 3 years instead of last patch you will see it's full of yield nerfs.
---
How did you make all your isk? Just saving up over time? Lots of trading?
---
Your entire argument hinges on an assumption that I can’t code my anom ratting C# sanderling bots to perform these extra steps. 
---
Well, two assumptions. One being that, the other being you’re providing CCP with another behavior trend to hook into when attempting to identify botting behavior.
---
If you think these assumptions are valid, then boy do me and my 12 year-after-year 23/7 anom ratting bots have something to say to you.. 😂😂
---
Season pass and don't forget the "New Delve" DLC Map Pack! ;)
---
On the contrary.  No counter argument to the AFK ratting was advanced.
---
Insults gets you nowhere bud.
---
Clusterfuck is still in existence... they just changed the label on the tin
---
&gt;And now you’re even walking it back.. “well not in the imperium but but but but I’m gonna regurgitate the shit I see everyday on here like a pro neckbeard”.

Your aim is off.

nobody cares about afk ratting

&gt;You're assuming the bots won't just be re-worked to drive by the local citadel and use the new drop off option to deposit the loot before hitting the next site  
---
Yup. And the same lower SP players in VNIs and Gilas he's trying to insulate from the changes will be at the mercy of buy orders for the loot, which will be shit compared to a Jita market value.

I started stretching my isk legs back in 2013. Nearly 500b passed through my trading alt that year \*tracked via my eve year in review\* I made a chunk in HS via Incursions. Thats what gave me the small capital to start market pvping. Then I stated ratting in Null Sec with a Machariel and then a Nidhoggur. Again most of the isk went to the market pvp wallet. Derped in c4 and c5 WHs a bit. Wasn't a fan so I went back to incursions in HS. Took a small break and then went back to null and started to super rat. That was a nice injection into market captial but it was a shred of isk compared to what I was making in the market. You can't put an ISK per Hour in market pvp at least in my opinion. Yeah 100m ticks were nice but in a week I could clear 20b in pure market profits.
---
That and CCP has removed a bunch of the mechanics that made it possible.
