Lots of people have lost all their space and assets. It happened to goons, it happened to test, it happened to PL kind of. You'll notice the alliances that survive are the ones that are not cults of personality.
---
---
---
I do planetary interaction for passive isk, and I actually enjoy it because I'm crazy. It's slow money, but it's still money.
---
Corps make Alliances, Alliances make Coalitions. There is not limit to the amount of people that can gather under the good skirt.
---
Now that is funny coming from PL...
---
So slicing bots makes eve players return to the game? Amen brother.
---
It's a fine chip, to be sure, but my ATi Rage Pro will blow it out of the water!
---
&gt;*But we do have some non-blues that we drop supers on. But then they never come back!!! Risk averse!!! Carebears!!!!
---
I quit
---
I need to see where this rabbit hole ends
---
EVE is dying, CCP, fix this instead of doing anything else ever!
---
Checks out
---
&gt; that's like 1.7 devs - remember that.
---

---
Sounded more like 200 million dollars lost in evaluation to me.
---
Which is also great, because CCP steak holders were going to pocket that shit. INSTEAD our korean overlords now have 200 million dollars saved. So OUR company won, our future won.  The best possible outcome is the bonus being lost because that money just leaves forever.
---
Read, you don't necessarily want CCP to reach the goals determined in the acquisition - it just goes to a dozen peoples hands and not into any game.
---

Dear CCP: EVE has finally died /s
---
The first few missions will "inject" some basic skills (Racial Frigate I included). 
---
If you have money to just buy the skillbooks you don't need to do them too much. If you do the career agent missions, you'll get a few frigates and random mods. Nothing too important if you have a stablished income.
---
&gt; Noob explorers use a T1 frig and stick to High Sec.
---
Why stick to hisec? Exploring low or null is perfectly fine with T1 frigs. Just keep watching dscan for scanner probes. That's how people find you. If you have loot you run. If you don't you keep analyzing. No need to be a pussy about your tech1 frig. The loot is worth dozens of it.
---
There's no way to really limit coalition sizes. Sure you can limit thr size of an alliance, but then the overflow just goes to a different alliance and the two groups ser each other blue and live in the same space.
---
So then you can limit the number of blues an alliance can have, then they just make agreements not to invade each other.
---
Nothing changes.
---
The best solution is probably some sort of mechanic that limits the number of players who can live in the same region, forcing groups to spread out.
---
That has problems too.
---
Goons got where they are today by understanding the game mechanics and how to best use them. Other groups have started to mimic the Goon model and they're starting to have similar success, though they have a lot of catching up to do.
---
Oh I did and said and caught much flak for predicting the outcome of recent CCPnanigens.

The Astero's strenghts are it's cloak, it's staying power from it's armor tank, and the drone DPS. 
---
If you fly a quadruple-stabbed astero with no cloak, you are removing 2 out of 3 pros, so you are paying 50 million for nothing more than drone dps. 
---
Not worth it. You'll get the same performance from T1 frigs at a fraction of the price.
---
That would be up to many highly paid lawyers,  but CCP went the route of they never wanting to risk finding out
---
Apparently its not the DX9 thats keeping them back. They've got ship textures which have twice the resolution but they're saved for trailers and such.
---
Performance issues apparently, they don't have a good enough system to have the whole game freeze when you zoom in on a 300 man battle yet. Even though 64 bit client is a thing nowdays.

As does you excessively posting here since you can't find content in game. gaypwnd

Oh god please let us delete entire cap fleets with a well timed cyno kill.

I’m not saying that would be a good idea, just that it is technically possible to make a change that does not benefit goons

Have people ever decided to just hang around on grid while not being able to accomplish anything but dying? I guess with booshers and HACs, and even MJD battleships, escaping a bad fight is easier than it was earlier, but that doesn’t have anything to do with logistics
---
And while it may be possible to repair the pool with duct tape, good luck trying to get the water back in...
---
They do have data sites, which drop drone alloys and bpcs and even have a chance to escalate.
---
When we're the 22000 bots banned? Specific date so we can see the effect on pcu of the ban. Why did they not make new accounts and go back to making money? Prove they did not.
---
[iwantisk.com](https://iwantisk.com) is still one of the main sites; but he's converted it to basically online slot machines with no connection to EVE.
---
make sure you finish all of the tutorials, tons of free loot and a good way to learn all the different early game systems
---
Always been curious about the full rules of this but only caught tidbits over the years.
---
I know you're allowed to still play the game on a fresh account after joining the company, provided you don't reveal your identity. Obviously no insider trading, but I doubt any CCP employees are hardcore invested enough in the actual game for that to be an issue.
---
But like, are there general guidelines on corps you're allowed to join? No null-sec blocs, etc? Strictly no voice comms? I would recognize CCP Fozzie/Raivi's voice instantly from when I was in PL with him.
---
Are yall just out there in some random "nobody" corps?
---
I'm curious how much CCP is actually active in EVE, out there getting a feel for what stuff is working and what feels bad/unfun
---
I thought Intrepid Crossing was though?
---
What point are you trying to make?
---
Um I fly with TXG and we have never been evicted bud.
---
You sound like a thin skinned classic beta. I feel sorry for your testicles.
---
And not only that, but he's lost so many fucking PvP ships in fights where he gets nothing, including in battleships.
---
Like maybe I'm totally overestimating my own PvP prowess here, but I feel like if I took some solo battleship fits out I'd at least snag a few kills on tackle/cruisers before dying. 
---
In his case it looks like he just goes out and feeds without ever getting anything.
---
Same thing that happens to most that get banned. Said some things that could not be taken back.
---
Adapt or die GSF.
---
Hard to say, I have [a character](https://zkillboard.com/character/1608229850/) that has a pretty bizarre killboard if you go through it, and I'm sure you'll be just as confused by that
---
Nothing wrong with that. I was just curious since most people seem to play to maximize cashflow not sightseeing.
---
ive been doing that for a while now but the most lucrative cans are difficult to do because of the 60 health /40 damage nodes . My heron does 25 damage and 3 shots them so i take 80 damage against one of those, while an astero/ t2 does 30 so two shots them and id take 40 damage instead
---
and im used to operating in WH/null

the reason I want the astero is cause ive been using a heron a while now but the most lucrative cans are difficult to do because of the 60 health /40 damage nodes .

The Centipede Caliphate is a strong alliance.

Damn, I use this pretty often to handle my alpha alts. Really liked it when I could see when 24 hours were remaining.
---
Thanks for this service.
---
&gt; that runs right up to the last day?
---
No he will run it before that so he knows ahead of time if he has to do something in addition to meet the bonus. No sense in giving himself no time to react

IMO, the key to alpha exploration is luck. You are going to have a HARD time with mainframes/databanks/ruins, etc. I've had more luck with Hunter herons, let others do the work and kill them.
---
Lmao
---
Looks like eve community said go back to wow one too many times kek
---
If only they did this shit to get rid of bots. That would atleast suggest a plan.
---
That is what the post was advocating for? Less sites that give a bigger payout is the same thing as scarcity. That is how supply/demand work.
---
Hey man, sorry if this brought up anything. I just was scrolling on r/all and happened to click on a post and noticed the eve character image.

I had to go back and look again to confirm you weren't trolling, nope it's there alright. Well played CCP
---
Thats actually about 12 devs. That's ~1.8M annually.

[removed]
---
Understandable. But despite the flood of *"I'm new to EVE (lol), but here's my expert opinion on why the blackout is good/bad"* type posts we've had lately, there are in fact genuine newbies out there that don't know the game inside and out yet.
---
Have to point out the obvious. All the people that were out in space were agreeing to getting shot at. These are the people the graphs are saying no longer are around. Whilst the PCU is far from a good metric its still relevant, if it falls then chances of you actually finding anything in space falls.
---
Fair point, need a chance to do a limited time new subscriber bonus where signing up gets you a few million SP for free and some frigate skins as a last ditch number pump effort.
---
Who?
---
fair enouff
---
Nope. I've been max out with a Caldari Navy agent for years. Still happily provides missions.
---
Wouldn't really make much sense, really. If a dude that has worked for you for years, routinely does a good job, and that you absolutely love, comes asking for work... would you reject him?
---
#fake news
---
You've said you are comfortable in jspace/00. I've a dedicated omega for this but if I was stuck in an alpha clone I wouldn't consider it unreasonable to use an Astero. If you know what you're doing the price tag shouldn't matter. The risk you will lose it is more of a certainty but if you're at all decent you've probably made a lot more first. It comes with the additional advantage of murdering overconfident Sabres. I'm not logged in right now but I can send you a fit in a while if you still need it.
---
It could have been autopiloted, lands at 15km, gets webbed down by the Raznaborgs and CODE noticed it.
---
A lot of people are really happy with blackout so far.  Myself included.
---
I know hate will always be louder than support, but this needs to be said.
---
That people running away because they don’t have enough logi has been a constant since 2003. So saying it causes ships to not die during wars doesn’t make sense
---
Use 2 emission scope sharpener rigs. That should make hacking significantly easier
---
They don't do those anymore.
---
UMM, muninns do not get alphad off by stukas....
---
Well, I am no expert, but outside of the reddit I am pretty sure you are in the minority.
---
I haven't really played much... there is no content.  The non-botting ratters aren't ratting, the botting ones have either come up with new tools, or moved to lowsec / high sec.  It just isn't worth my time to login or sub my accounts.  I appreciate that CCP is trying to do SOMETHING, but it seems like this is not working and if anything has driven a large number of paying accounts away in the name of "chaos".
---
How about, instead of a band aid, which is what they like to do, they release fully thought out features with some actual development time?  How about instead of just killing local, you create a way for players to make local if they want?  Don't want ratting to be repetitive and boring... how about make a ratting and mining system that encourages players to be active.
---
I am not saying I have any answers here, but just killing local, and some dumb cyno changes isn't doing anything except driving away long term players who have kept the lights on at CCP for years when no one else wanted to play their shitty games.
---
Skills/implants can make the difference more than the hull. However, so to can intelligently hacking. When you have a Covops frig, implants, T2 analyzers (meaning skills at V obv)... it becomes more trivial. In that case, you can hardly fail. However, your factor is the CovOps Cloak not being fit. IF you are going to hang your ass out to be shot off, you may as well do so in a cheaper ship and use whatever Alpha-state options you can to increase your chances without increasing cost. Also, there is strategy (a la minesweeper) to the nodes and the numbers on them. Also, most final nodes are in corners/edges and the ORDER in which you kill some nodes matters as they buff other nodes/etc.
---
It is the unfortunate side effect of what you are trying to accomplish. The alternative, is sticking to lower-isk and therefore lower-risk sites in HS. IME, those are so rare, that you'd be better off risking a T1 Frig in a C1 or C2 WH found in HS.
---
The only way you are going to mitigate risk is by a.) living in a WH with friends who are in the chain and somewhat watching your back, b.) paying for 2 accounts on Omega and watching a WH and DScan on an alt while hacking on main... or c.) do it cheap enough that it doesn't matter if you get caught.
---
Go with C, because A and B only slightly mitigate the chance of being caught, and B opens your options to higher-SP and CovOps cloaking... so you don't need the extra eyes (which is no guarantee anyhow).
---
Fit T1 Explorer. Find the best one for the job, and do not spend a dime on bling/tank/offense/etc. Analyzer of each type, Scanning Mods in Mids to help you spend less time scanning (get a reg. cloak at least), MWD, T1 rigs for exploration of your choosing.
---
Figure out your locking range and the range of a Cargo Scanner. I don't remember off the top of my head. A cargo scanner can allow you to skip junk cans, and scan them from a distance with all of them targeted while aligned out of the site. If anyone warps into a site, they are going to land at zero on you more often than not. Some will combat scan and land near you, but you should see that coming. Set a custom orbit that allows you to be in range to loot as soon as the hack is over (orbit at 2km with Prop off).
---
Another tip: Warp to sites at 100 and fly away from where you land a bit until all cans are &gt;150km away from you. Make a bookmark. Now, warp to a can, hack it, loot it, warp away or to your bookmark. Cloak, check DScan, de-cloak and warp to another can... repeat.
---
Decide on a figure you are comfortable leaving with. You don't have to fill your cargo and the longer you are there, the less safe it is. Early on, aim for double your ship value, leave the area and go sell loot. BUY another ship and fit it. Now go back out and look to triple that or more... you have another ship to earn with, maybe even buy another. Now you don't have to worry as much as you have a way to earn back what you lose.
---
You are already hitting roadblocks, so think about getting a subscription to Eve. Buy some PBnJ, don't go out to eat one night a week and boom... you could pay for 2 subs or multi-month one account for cheaper per month.
---
FRIENDS. Join a corp, and maybe join a WH Corp that will let you hang in their C1 or C2 static, hacking things they may not even bother with. Get a WH corp that has a LS/NS static, do the same kinda things.
---
Hope all that is helpful, but make peace with half-assing, or don't half-ass things. That's really what this comes down to.
---
You can get some Asteros blown up once you have the isk, but don't risk everything on it early on. Personally, as an alpha, I would never waste that ISK, because people may actually IGNORE you in a Imicus. They will absolutely try to find and kill you in an Astero because they will think it has Sisters Launchers/Probes, a cargo full of loot and other stuff on it.
---
EVE is like a drug.
---
Long enough away from it, and people start to realize they were hooked on a bad thing.
---
Got it, thanks!
---
Oh I agree :) just in a station it's goofy
---
There is also the implant. I believe the cheap one is +5 virus health.
---
Even without those rigs and implants about 75% of the red relic sites are doable with the TI analyser in a heron, with alpha skills. You just have to be much more efficient at how you play the mini game. With TII analyser you're spoilt and start getting lazy about when to click on viruses.
---
This but unironically
---
Is there any groups that already done what you said? Build dreads and faxes, seems great.
---
&gt;Our corporation has nothing to do with the lack of modules in the besieged strongholds before the attack. Inner Hell didt receive or transfer ISK to bribe and use spies before the attack
---
xdxdxdxd
---
You are a sitting duck in a relic/data site IF the person hunting you already has it bookmarked. Otherwise, you could finish some cans while they attempt to scan you down and then probe out the site. Provided they don't use Combat Probes and know what they are doing with them.
---
As a noob with no cloak, create bookmarks between warp points, DScan in the direction of something (like a WH) befor eyou warp to it.
---
Also, BOOKMARK the WH you came in from, after you enter the WH... and don't forget to recover your probes.
---
Please log into the game
---
The game is designed to be played as Omega. Think to Alpha as a permanent trial (one that is far far less restrictive as in other games).
---
There is no pay to win in EVE! Yea I know is hard to believe ... but no amount of cash will win a fight. Knowledge and friends will ... and trust is a hard currency!
---
The only way to win EVE is not to play ... u will understand me in a few years.
---
If they are C5/6 holes then carrier rolling is much faster, also, what fits/ships are you using to roll them? 6 rolling BS’s can kill a hole in like 30s max and are easy to run on alts...
---
i dont play this game so i can flex to other people  
---
i dont give a shit if five thousand nerds sit through 10% tidi for fifteen hours to get their pcgamer participation reward  
---
i can do my own thing instead and it's not going to be less real because there wasn't a clickbait article written about it
---
edit: and let's be honest, big fights might generate some attention and short term injection of new players, but they are not fun gameplay by themselves
---
It is a little funny.  It's almost like people don't PAY to be other people's content, or PAY to grind out things in a much much harder way than their predecessors.  
---
Yet nobody realizes this. These. Changes. Aren't. FUN.  Sure, they feel fun for the roaming frigates, but that's at EVERYONE else's expense.  And that's not fun.  
---
Fighting back is fun. Fighting is fun.  Being put on a pedastal with a bullseye painted on your chest with chains forcing you there because "go to wow if you dont like it" isnt engaging or entertaining. 
---
When people aren't having fun.  "Shut up and leave" is going to get exactly what you're asking for... and if your idea of fun is nobody to shoot in anything but the SAME thing you're flying... then welcome to the very thing you hate about supercapital proliferation.  
---
It's sad.  It's a little funny.  But it's fucking sad.
---
Under rated comment and absolutely correct...sadly.
---
Keep in mind that we had PIBC people coming over from Serenity this year. We should actually be seeing higher PCU this year in comparison to 2018. The real drop is thus even bigger than the above numbers.
---
But looking at the 1 year chart I found something else of interest. The PCU dropped a bit in april which was when Rorq, HAW and carrier tracking nerfs hit. If I remember it correctly the PIBC people came in may which is when the PCU recovered and then june was the burning of the north so PCU dropped again.
---
Whats interesting it that it potentially explains the motivation behind these changes. They implemented substantial nerfs and lost subs but I think they misunderstood the spike that came after. I think they somehow thought that was linked to the nerfs (or atleast that the nerfs didnt matter) and not simply Serenity people joining. Thats why they felt they could nerf again and it would probably lead to the same results, unsubs followed by more subs.
---
Which would explain why Rise said they are expecting short term losses but long term gains which is a rather bad assumption considering nothing of value (mechanic wise) has actually been changed. That statement didnt really make sense but it kinda does now.
---
If this really was the motivation behind these changes then I have to say, CCP knows much much less about the game than I suspected.
---
It definitely is designed to be played as an omega, however you can do alot of things and fly alot of ships as an Alpha.
---
Pretty much the only thing you're locked out of is capital ships (more end-game content anyway) T2 and T3 ships (specialised versions of the T1 ships) and Planetary Interaction (passive isk making)
---
It really isn't bad flying as an alpha... Try it out for a few months and if you do get hooked, you can always go omega later (you can even dip into and out of omega status without hurting your character).
---
Hope this helps.
---
PS. Welcome.... And Join a player corporation :)
---
Everyone keeps saying don't, instead of answering your question.
---
Fit a shield tank (passive resists), and the combo of nanos and i-stabs to get align time under 2s. D-Scan like mad. Dump loot in HS perodically. 
---
You will die, eventually, but you should easily pay off your 60M investment in a few pirate sites.
---
J-Space pirates will kill you in a Heron just as happily as if you're in an Astero. It isn't like flying a cheap ship somehow makes you less content - might as well fly an attractive ship with good bonuses.
---
You don't have to decline you just don't request after completing the previous one. (The UI is a little confusing but there should be two different dialogues.)
---
By your flair, i know this triggers you.
---
It scares you to realize how toxic your playstyle and mindset is to literally everyone else, doesnt it? And now that facts are coming out to back it up... you're getting defensive.  That isn't good.
---
Huh. That's funny. I didn't even know anyone knew about the site quite frankly. I never tracked it. Yah my favorites were the warp scrambling drones and maybe the old Daredelvil-looking Polaris Enigma with that field effect. Also the Drone infested Domi of course... there are some neat ones in the archive. Yah everything I ever did was built based on a code executions on Cribba's database dump. He stopped updating it on the reg and I stopped giving a shit, particularly when Paul built his sweet site. 2 iterations before the one I linked he had one that looked like mine but better in it's presentation... I'll take another look at it when I'm free again and update it. There's a lot of history to cover... *edit: and if you are interested in EvE history, there's some neat stuff behind that Enigma. Someone killed a drunk dev in nullsec one time... kinda famous pirates but I can't remember them, but they did it. At the time, CCP just gave them a big PLEX and a pat on the ass before they took it away. Later, someone got a Cockroach killing a tester in the wrong place on the wrong server. They took that away too. Recently though, some guys got a Cockroach basically in the same way, and CCP let them keep it! A player now has a testing ship that no other player can pilot because it takes a Polaris skillbook. I just think that's neat. I wish the earlier guys could have kept their trophies too, but I like to see CCP getting on board with game principals. No one is safe. Not even a dev.*
---
I’m looking forward to seeing what you make!😁
---
I have be without a computer for some time and would love to get my eve fix on mobile if anyone would be so kind as to gift me their activation code if they cannot use it.
---
both T2 ships and T2 analayzers require omega, if i could use a buzzard i would. Didnt consider implants though. also all cloaks require omega fyi
---
Im going to get a subscription still just not for a bit. Thanks for the other advice ive already been doing t1 exploration for a long time , thoug i didnt think of the cargo scanner so thanks for that
---
I used to be in a null / wh corp , but the corp basically ended a short time after we finished the goal we created our corp do to (shut down our previous corp Yokai, and run them out of the great wildlands)
---
im going to be running solo for a bit before i decide if i want to join an ull or a wh corp, we'll see
---
Is this what my kids call "copypasta"?
---
I did say this was merely one contributing factor, and never said it was the sole contributing factor.
---
[EDIT] Would you like me to explain my original reasoning for you?
---
Yes, totally safe :) I'm for sure not sitting at the site last hour killing anyone inside
---
I have about 7,000 kills across my accounts, 6,000 on my main. Most of them are in small gang. I have a subcap with over 100 killmarks that I regularly took out and almost lost several times. Would have been a great ~8B loot pinata for the lucky gang that took me down. I sometimes FC'd small fleets and was in the top 25 all time kills of one of the largest corporations in EVE. I'm still just a drop in the bucket, but you can go ahead and keep thinking I'm just a giant krab.
---
no worries, just wanted to make the point that all men need to be more open about it  
---
I make sure all my staff talk about having a bad day or worse and all my guild members too  
---
Ragnaros will be there tomorrow, your feelings are always there ;)

IM TIRED OF WSPACE TAKING EVERYTHING OVER WTF NOW KSPACE HAS HONORBRAWLS THIS IS BULLSHIT CCP
---
AFAIK they undock as long as the opponent doesn't show up in min/maxed t2 hulls, try a t1 cruiser roam there and I bet you'll get a good fight.
---
&gt; We trained new pilots for a long time and they needed the practice of fighting against a well-trained enemy.

&gt; The Mighty Beans

What?
---
I'm a fucking lowsec FW pirate; I purposely avoid being blue to anyone because it limits the number of people I can shoot. It's objective fact that there isn't shit for players online at 0100-0400. It has nothing to do with alliances.
---
lmao "pirate" arrrr m80 gimmie de lewt before ye die!
---
Fuckin dork.
---
see above
---
You can enjoy a huuuge swath of eve as just an alpha, dont worry.  There is a guy in my corp who has been alpha for almost 2 years and it hasnt held him back, he just flies different roles in fleets. 
---
I would highly suggest just playing as alpha for a few weeks at least to get a better idea of the game.  You may decide to pay, or maybe not.   I started off as alpha for almost 8 months, and ended up plexing in game.  
---
The beauty of eve, there are so many ways to get to where you want to go.
---
everyone talkin shit about "small gang is dead" so... grow a set homes
---
"honorbrawls" was a thing called "alliance tournaments" however, there is a thing called "small gang warfare" get good scrub. caps don't make you have a big peen, but even your epeen shrinks when you cant stand up to a fair fight bruh
---
Indeed, they require Omega. I was merely pointing out that the bonus you get from the Astero to make hacking easier isn't a huge one. The huge gains there are with Omega, and with Alpha you just have to actually play the minigame. I rarely fail with a bunch of fancy toys at my disposal, and when I do it is usually because of RNG springing the nastiest things on me or me not paying attention to the nodes.
---
I wasn't aware all cloaks required Omega. The non-CovOps isn't a huge advantage to a newbro, so I'm shocked it isn't allowed. I guess that would've made Alphas pretty OP for camping areas though just sitting in space in WH/NS. Makes sense in that case. I haven't played as an Alpha, so forgive me for not knowing the limitations. There may be implant limits too, but I wonder if you can implant then unsub and still get the bonus? Not sure how that works, tbh
---
Another tip: Avoid opening the White Dot nodes that appear when you click on them, unless you really need a buff. They can be a nasty bad node and it isn't worth putting a bad debuff in play until you were likely to fail anyhow.
---
If you didn't know already: USE the wrench as soon as you pick it up. It applies over turns and will boost your HP up, not just repair what is missing.
---
Don't overkill nodes with some of the attack ones and use shields on a node you clear to get access to the final node.
---
Sylnn, mate, this is INHE, they evict people all the time, and they're actually good at it... In this case I'm pretty willing to believe them; especially over BEEENs of all people.
---
Whatever man I mine bistot in nullsec and pay my corp taxes just keep your dick slapping out of my system and leave us eat asteroids in peace.  I got mouths to feed.
---
I would also add that there is no "winning" of eve.  Its a sandbox game, so its what you make of it.
---
[deleted]
---
Yep, I tried to have a go at Eve after about a year away. 
---
It was just so much tedium I only stayed on for an hour to try and chat with old Corp mates but there was almost no one left. 
---
I won't be back.
---
Just came back two weeks ago and the worst part about eve is this subreddit and all it's bitching.
---
BuT wHaT aBoUt WhEn OuR tEaMsPeAk CrAsHeD!!
---
I can hear the Goons eye twitching after seeing this post lol
---
No, it is just easier, unironically, to change skill queues in the app than in eve.
---
I was today years old when I discovered Inner Hell have a 'code'
---
Are you retarded? It just means I fly in FW space with literally no allegiance, specifically so I have more targets. I'm the opposite of what you claimed in an attempt to discredit me.
---
There simply aren't enough people in New Eden.
---
You can do a lot of shit as an alpha yeah but you'll be gimped. Suggest you just fork over the fast food dinner price a month and play the game if you spend more than 10hrs a month playing.
---
I thought I knew you, Red. Although I should have known with a name like that you'd side with the ruskies...
---
Although I thought it was widespread that the guy (drawing a blank, townsomething) unfitted it because *beans* didn't want to evict *inner hell* which was what he wanted initially. So he settled for aiding IH evict Beans.

Kind of. Upgrading DX9 doesn't just give them a higher budget for texture resolution but also allows them to do all sorts of neat things. If you get a chance flip through [this doc](http://the-eye.eu/public/Books/Gentoomen%20Library/Game%20Development/Programming/Microsoft%20DirectX%2010%20Technical%20Brief.pdf) on improvements of DX10 over DX9. Like even the overhead improvements from DX10 are leagues ahead of what can be done in DX9. Not to mention upgrading to a newer shader model. Like art wise, once CCP gets rolling with DX12 shit is going to start looking better. There are so many optimizations between 9 and 12 and those freed up resources can be used on other aspects.
---
Some other neat links:
---
[Nvidia slideshow](https://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/GDC2011/GDC2011EpicNVIDIAComposite.pdf) talking about DX11
---
[another slideshow](http://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc2016/Presentations/meyer_jonas_rendering_hitman_with.pdf) from Io-Interactive talking about DX12's role in Hitman.
---
He sounds like an idiot. And he probably didn't get paid for it lmao... but that story changed so many times, who knows at this stage.
---
If you can't find people to PvP in Black Rise I really don't know what to tell you.
---
Piracy isn't a thing in even, and hasn't been for a long time. It's what morons call themselves to romanticize the facts they live in Null Lite and don't actually own anything.
---
AT was shit and deserved to die.
---
Did you just unironically use "get good" in a post where you're begging for people to fight you but no baddies with caps!!!! Lmao
---
whats your thoughts on warp stabs?
---
PR manager. Man I am completely parked in this game.
---
Hey, if the usual suspects don't feel like putting in the work, by all means let their absence free up space for new players. EVE has no problem attracting new players, the problem is keeping them in. Given the amount of "is it too late to start" posts in this game's history, wiping the old limescale off the map is nothing but a benefit.
---
Playing as Alpha is the Demo version of Eve.
---
He likely is. And I haven't kept up too much with that tbf. But making a basically uncontested eviction of an AFK corp because they're a loot pinata seem grandiose is silly
---
Borisssss hello hello!
---
No it's just a run of the mill retard.
---
Look, I know this will get downvoted, but the current concurrent logged in numbers say otherwise.  Eve is losing more players then gaining.
---
And yet you are still in this subreddit...
---
The only thing that brings people into the game are other people.
---
Your argument has no basis in reality.  There is empty space everywhere.  The only thing chasing out older players accomplishes is collapsing the economy, and killing off long term subscribers who have kept the game afloat.
---
In the year of our Lord 2019, how many new players to Eve are going to put up with the lackluster tutorial,  complicated interface and convoluted skill system?
---
Quit trying to push out the people who have kept the game going, and fix the problems that keep new players from staying
---
Given how that doesn't take into account alts or bots I'm going to be rather skeptical in taking that number at face value, especially with over 15000 bot accounts axed in the first half of 2019 alone.
---
Actual *player* count is obfuscated quite heavily on our end.
---
losing bots?
---
Tori is my secret IH crush.
---
Sitting on your ass dropping super blobs on anything that gets near your grind machines isn't "keeping the game going", it's fat that needs to be cut.
---
You still die to sabres and gatecamps.
---
Expert explorers use an astero or even a tengu/stratios because if I'm going to carry a billion in loot, my ship should be able to defend itself (and gank others when necessary).
---
I've never even played eve and I browse this subreddit.
---
Moon mining an option? With a t1 barge I feel like the profitability is pretty good. A proc or covetor pays itself off in like an hour everything after is profit.
---
those arent common in wh space in my expreince but ill keep it in mind when i run in null (havent done that in a while, thanks for the reminder)
---
'Secret'
---
Possibly, and there seems to be a preoccupation with sexual organs and capital ships.  I think a big ship gives you a big pen.  There's people with huge shlongs that dont know how to use them.  I could get an avatar which is essentially a giant space dick and not know how to fly it worth a damn but I sure would have a massive peen.
---
no baddies in caps? lolz, if you drop caps dont cry... but you wanna talk smack, i dont see you coming to fight, so stow it where you stow your epeen. in your wife's pocket purse
---
You're my favorite r/eve badass now
---
you mean you have a mouth to feed your employers epeen to, lolz, where you live at hoe?
---
how about you ask your wife if you can borrow your epeen?
---
You're really into talking about dicks yknow
---
It's a shame that the blue doughnut exists also in wormholes. Well done, killing off the small guys who didn't/couldn't resist.
---
Collusion.
---
My employer let's me dock and stuff, and has free pizza on Tuesdays.  I bet your employer doesnt have free pizza.  I live down the street.
---
did i even say that at all? no. no i did not, you did, you must have a fetish with it, i wrote, and i quote "epeen", so... get it right, you are the one with a fixation on that appendage, myself, im interested in making you some content in a game that is full of exploding ships, what are you doing besides shit posting on reddit? probably thinking about my appendage i take  it since that's where your head's gone to.
---
thanks for the compliment, im really looking forward to -9000 karma, please give me your downvotes.
---
T3C or Stratios, sure.
---
Astero is only good for showing off, or sneaky PvP. Otherwise you're better off with a CovOps frigate.
---
Why do you do that to yourself?
---
Heya!
---
To be self-sufficient, you'll want to have at least one omega character (for market/ PI / better availability of skills). 
---
That said, don't be afraid to be alpha for a while. There's no true "winning" of Eve; there's always something different and new to do that you haven't tried. Omega broadens those horizons.
---
P.S. - Join a corp that values new players. Feel free to check out [Dreddit](https://dredditisrecruiting.com). Don't give up!
---
This reddit had a vocal majority that are in favor of crap like this and very anti “krab” 
---
what are you smiling beyond wishing you weren’t in the majority for some reason?
---
Is it that you want r/eve to be even MORE of a “elitepvp” circlejerk than it already is and other opinions scare you?
---
Contact Slader Harkeness about joining a wormholer corp
---
Undocking in nothing but frigs and being zkillboard whoring risk averse scaredy cats isn’t keeping the game going either
---
It’s fat that needs to be cut or this game WILL die.
---
You’re right
---
Let’s consider the BOTS HAVENT QUIT.  She real players have
---
You’re blind or a fool if you’ve ignored that fact
---
How's that manly man womanly ball tits ball dropping balls and balls tits ball peen gang going so far?
---
Good, I’m seeing more actual player activity and am enjoying the game more than ever.
---
I have a similar story.  And I am still in this sub Reddit.  For 3 years Now.  I still like to keep up even tho I don't recognize any names any more.  Eve was a big part of my life.  And this sub has changed so much.  It used to be a lot busier, just like Eve.  I miss it sometimes, but it's like missing your 20s...  you'll never get those times back.  Memes are still good.
---
1.) The agency is a good place for answering the question, "I've logged in and I wonder what there is to do around me." It's going to have a lot of PvE opportunities, it will also show faction warfare, too.
---
2.) Work on your skills and your capabilities as a pilot. I'd suggest focusing on a certain weapon type (missiles, projectiles, energy) and get good at them, along with their ships. The more you specialize, the more damage you'll do, and the faster things blow up.
---
3.) Friendship fleet is the best fleet. Since you asked, feel free to check out [Dreddit](https://dredditisrecruiting.com).
---
4.) Neither ship or skills are useless! The fits have probably changed, but the ships and skills themselves not so much. Go take some T1 frigates out and get killed and kill stuff. Look up the killboard for them and learn what worked and what didn't. It's a cheap and great way to get better at fitting your ship and PvP in general.
---
Fly dangerously o7
---
Nope, I'm enjoying the game and these bs memes and bitching with no constructive criticism thing is tired and lame. I don't care how many people agree with me, it's a fun game. I'm not interested in majorities, or minorities. It's a subjective thing to say I enjoy something and if others do as well then awesome and if not, meh. You may wish to imply I have a motive other than what I stated in my above comment. I do not, and it only further exposes your motive of further destruction, perhaps out of spite, of a game that many quite enjoy. Be well, friend.
---
On that I agree, tested pasting evemon skill planner and the client almost shat itself.
---
They dont slice bots. In fact bots have adatped to the blackout better than people. So gtfo with your bs.
---
&gt; The best solution is probably some sort of mechanic that limits the number of players who can live in the same region, forcing groups to spread out.
---
I'm coming back after three years and I remember that being an explicit reason for the changes to sov warfare. You can see how that turned out.
---
Safety in numbers man.... until mittens closes shop that's the way it goes.
---
I don't think you understand what I mean. Look into nano gangs, small-gang content, like less than 10 people. No, you don't need to log in your 17 alts. 
---
Look into small scale engagements where as a group you work together to, at times, fight against the odds and outnumbered, but relying on decision making to stay afloat. 
---
It isn't always about the huge f1 blobs, while I understand there's a lot of people that enjoy that, you can't use that as a blanket generalization, for PVP in EVE. 
---
I'm going to challenge you, try it out. Don't care about ISK positive or killmails and all that. It will only hinder your learning experience. Try being part of a nano gang, where you pilot your ship, no anchors, you make calls, etc.
---
You're going to get an epiphany; you will be flying your own ship.
---
69m SP? Nice
---
Are you some kind of pro-blackout propaganda bot or something?
---
I don't see how an actual human could fail to remember that the blackout had ENORMOUS support initially, with anyone criticizing it being trolled and downvoted into oblivion. It was loudly and repeatedly proclaimed that the blackout would fix any and all problems with EVE, turning nullsec into "gudfights 4ever". Have you forgotten all of those posts already?
---
The opposition the blackout faces at this point is well-deserved; it was given every chance, even when doing so required completely ignoring logic - claiming that it's unpopular now simply because "hate will always be louder than support" is...I can't even think of a word that can adequately describe that level of absurdity. You sound like something out of a Monty Python skit.
---
^ this guys gets it.
---
We can hope.
---
Are you seriously trying to claim that a handful of frigates are worse for the game than multiple maxed out cap and super fleets?
---
"Who?" Welcome to PL's future bruh.
---
This is literally what I do. I am the little guy. My alliance is 6-10 humans and 30 toons.
---
Everything I have claimed still stands, if anything more so because of how sure you were that I was a bloc f1 monkey.
---
It's a tragedy. I'd still be playing it if it were good - in fact if it were as good as it used to be, I'd quit Eve to play it as my primary hobby-time game in a heartbeat.
---
Well, CCP threw that to the wind when they made infinite anomalies in one system.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
20 active in a 300 man corp is still 20+ for fleets.
---
Show us on the doll where the manticore touched you.
---
The ratio is much higher in smaller alliances where alts become more necessary. You can also factor activity in, so while 5/human might be true, as far as activity goes, the number of people you'll see in a fleet and such will appear closer to 10/human.
---
Unsubbing rn.
---
I'll take your word for it, I'm just going by word of mouth. Someone could tell me they put Jita in WH space and I'd have to believe them
---
Wasn't there something about spreading anoms through constellations back then?

Hiring is not a thing. You get recruited. Join a corp doing something you like; as it was since 2006.

that's why i don't plex anymore

This is something I plan on doing. I just joined a hi sec Corp that does moon mining.
---
Don't bother; this stuff has been explained to them many times already.
---
At this point, anyone who DOESN'T understand the negative effects of the blackout is either hopelessly stupid and in denial, or just doesn't care enough to think / read about it enough to understand.
---
Trying to explain it to them will get you 1d3 responses per target, pulled at random from a hat containing the following lines:
---
\- I deserved more kills than I was getting pre-blackout, so the blackout is a good thing.
---
\- Only bots quit over the blackout.
---
\- Everyone who mines or rats is a bot.
---
\- EVE doesn't need krabs, it only needs "real" players; krabs don't contribute anything to the game anyways.
---
\- Nullsec was stangnant and capitals were being proliferated. No, I don't understand what "stagnant" or   "proliferated" mean, but I can repeat those buzzwords and get upvotes!
---
\- People only quit because of WoW Classic being available, not because of the blackout.
---
\- Player count is only dropping because it's summer/friday/fall/september/hammer time/raining outside/groot's birthday; it happens this time every year.
---
\- EVE gets lots of new players, so it can afford to lose an arbitrarily large portion of its playerbase.
---
\- Hilmar says he introduced the blackout because it's a good thing, and not just because he's groping blindly in the dark for ways to temporarily increase player count so that he can get his bonus in October.
---
Further attempts at reason will simply result in more draws from the hat. If the hat runs out, lines will simply be recycled.
---
Maybe do the sisters epic arc? I hear at the end you get a really good bump in standings if you do something correctly
---
Looks great! A simplistic and easy layout. This could be a Skillq replacement for me if the Character Dashboard could be sorted by  total time remaining in the skill queue (least to greatest amount of time)
---
This helps me to know which characters I need to attend to.
---
It's like watching a terrarium filled with nerds and sociopaths.
---
So I'm trying this out but can't see how I can use this to manage skill queues. You can only see information about 1 character at a time.
---
Have you tried orbiting the can at 2000?
---
This is my favorite review of EVE ever.
---
Same tbh.
---
Complaining without proposing a solution is whining. And even properly complaining won’t get you anywhere.
---
Unless CCP are now running TQ on a raspberry pi, EVEs running costs are likely higher than back then.
---
What, if anything, happens when it gets to 100?
---
thank man for your services.
---
lol
---
What group are you with and where are you roaming?
---
C'mon mate, express yourself appropriately. Being drunk is no excuse. You seem to dislike &lt;insert thing, whatever it is&gt; being broken, but you aren't helping either yourself or the game with this. I'm not your mother, but this is a joke.
---
That's a really bad argument. That may have been the intention, but it was not the result, and nothing about the game mechanics introduced since then has encouraged alliances to spread out. Rather it's encouraged them to close in.
---
It's kind of insane that a 40k person coalition can live in more or less live in 200 systems (Delve + Fountain). That means that, on average, each system supports 200 accounts. It used to be that when there was another person ratting in the same system as you it was a hindrance, particularly if that person didn't know how to farm the belts. Now you can have multiple capitals in the same system ratting.
---
So, if that was the point of the changes over the past few years, then they failed spectacularly at that vision.
---
My understanding is that the point of the sov changes wasn't to force groups to spread out, but to make it easier for smaller groups to take sov. Which may have caused more groups to split up, had it not been so useful to have a super umbrella to exploit the endless resources contained within a single region.
---
No but the entitled cowards that pilot them are.
---
And now you can't unsee. Bwahahahaha
---
What does "getting promoted" mean?
---
To clarify ...
---
If you accept a mission, there is an agent standing penalty if you don't complete it.  So don't accept missions you don't intend to complete within a week (epic arc missions never expire though).
---
You can decline one mission per agent per hour.  Note that the text will change from "[every 4 hours](http://go-dl.eve-files.com/media/1201/2012.01.09.13.24.14.jpg)" to "in the next 4 hours" if you've already declined a mission with that agent, and an hour hasn't passed yet.
---
It is a BAD idea to lose standing with R&amp;D agents (that give datacores), as there is no way to regain standing with them.  Of course, datacore farming is not as lucrative as it once was; most datacores now come from faction warfare cash-outs.

Are you honestly claiming Goons, PL, and TEST, are not cults of personality?
---
I love how you can call frigate pilots both entitled and more problematic than injected super fleets.
---
If you don't krab then you're a wallet warrior so no matter what you do, there's a derogatory term for you!
---
with the astero I can at least gank all the other t1/t2 explorer frigs
---
Did you actually safe log and not just force close client? Bc if you do that and have a timer from something your ship stays in space until that timer runs out
---
Yep, because those 3B fit lokis just magically appear in space that real eve players just stumble across.
---
Incursions. that's always a good place for a reboot.
---
Ticket the GM'S about it. I don't know of any timers for ships that would keep you stuck in space for 6 hous
---
Sure, they whine and whine and whine about how they are entitled to kills, they dont want to do the work to get kills, they run as soon as something that an hurt them comes along, so instead they want the system changed to spoon feed them kills, they dont actually contribute much to the game, just want entertainment and kills fed to their risk averse asses.
---
Baaahahahha gold
---
For the first time ever. And i seriously mean it.
---
I agree with ironbank. 
---
These changes are killing the game faster then ever before.
---
Edit : it's almost sad to see that we lost ~7k players due to the mismanagement of the game we love.
---
Boy if you ain't the whole goddamned circus.
---
Because no, they fucking *don't*.
---
There's a *colossal* difference between "there's no way we can take this in the smallest usable vessel class in the game" and "let's drop the mass of a literal planet on two cruisers", but I don't expect you to understand that. Except here's the thing: frigate fleets welp themselves against *everything*, and do it *all the fucking time*.
---
Meanwhile for the first time in a decade something averse is happening to folks like you and y'all treat it like it's the end of the world.
---
At this point I'm honestly questioning if you know what game you're talking about and frankly I ain't wasting the sanity to find out.
---
Its less active because its more moderated now
---
 less r/all baitposts,  b4r posts, recruitment posts, stream posts and general trashposts 
---
Commenters are all still autistic as fuck but at least there is a filter in place to seperate the trash from the shit
---
Nice vid as usual.
---
You need to start using hotkeys man. Watching you fumble all your modules as your frantically spam click all over the screen hurts my soul. Hotkeys are awkward at first as you get used to them but they eventually become deeply ingrained in your play and you don't even need to think about them.
---
Nothing should keep your ship in space for 6 hours... Open a ticket
---
I need nothing for sustenance but the tears and scrap metal of my foes.
---
Low-damage buffer tanked mission mega gets defanged, neuted by triple-repped itty with cap boosters after being baited by a wreckflip.
---
I have no opinion either way since I'm still catching up. It seems like you and the other guy who replied to me agree though. I do remember the "small groups take sov" thing but I also remember hearing it was to force fights over a larger area as opposed to being concentrated in a single system.
---
When i was starting I asked for help fitting one like you, and got a similar replies. I ignored them and got an astero anyways and I was more than happy with it even before I could fit a covops cloak due to the astero bonuses.
---
Morale of the story is to think for yourself and rely less on opinions. You could begin with low sec exploration and carry a combat fit to run frigate size ded complexes, run relics and fly into c1 holes to clear sansha sites from there which will 99% of the time be empty.
---
I would fit the travel fit for align time and scan bonus, mwd cargo scan analizer and array in mids. The combat fit with armor rep adaptive plating, no plates. Mwd or ab a web and rest of the slots to help with capacitor. Acolytes and head to amarr low sec for example. Google the ded sites you find to see what to expect.
---
There's a bit of a difference between commenting on a post from this sub that came up in your feed and actively browsing it

Theyre all spaceships, and they both arent countereable unless they themselves fuck up.

Deal with it, cry if you must. But thats how it is

It didn't change. You probably heard misrepresentations of it from unassociated sources that you assumed contradictory but were just misheard hearsay.

This isn't even accurate on the most basic of details. The initial invasion fleet was all lokis, nightmares weren't brought in until the armor and hull timers. Were you even there? This account looks like it was compiled from stalking zkill and reading vague shitposting on Praisbob. Also the english here doesn't look like what any russian I've ever talked to has ever typed, this looks like a poor approximation of broken english from a native russian speaker.
---
I've been running null / wh c1-3 for a while now, just in a heron. I'll probably follow the advice of the wingspan guy who replied
---
&gt; Stop blueing all of ustz then?
---
then maybe ccp should make the optimal way to play eve not to have to blue each other?
---
Only having belt rats didn't stop large coalitions existing. It just meant that there were fewer people in 0.0
---
Currently there seems to be an inconsistent quality to some of the ship textures. If you look at the remodelled Munnin up close and compare it to Eagle up close then all the remodelled Caldari ships at least look a lot sharper with significantly less blur. I don't know if the actual resolution is better but most skins on remodelled Caldari hulls look great. Even the ones I usually hate. They look trash on Minmatar though.
---
What are your thoughts on drones? I have a lot invested in that and only a moderate amount invested in missiles and beams. Not much at all in kinetic. I remember I had planned on going missile bird as I also have a lot of Caldari ship skills. Back at the time I remember thinking drones would go well with most builds.
---
Are there any type of achievements or the old rank system that would say like you need heavy missile specialist 4, energy efficient 3 etc etc. I liked it because it made me think of skill combos and bigger picture goals? One could argue ship prerequisites do the same thing but I don’t know it had a different flavor to it.
---
I really appreciate all the advice detail you gave.
---
lmao WoW players say the same thing every xpac.

"Sure it's trash, but art team delivered!"

"Shut up and enter your payment details."

---
I did safe log. However, even with timers, that just delays things for up to about 15mins. I'm estimating that it was at least 6 hours (likely more) from when I stopped playing to when the killmail is recorded to have occurred.
---
Thank you to the variety of responses. 
---
One other question instead of starting a new topic as I’m having some difficulty tracking this down online. Where do I find all of my research points? I forget if those stay with individual agents/facilities and is there a way for me to pull that up? 
---
Also to the dude talking about “hiring“ for a corporation… At first I thought I must be reading too much into it that you weren’t intentionally being that specific type of nerd whom we have all met that takes any opportunity be condescending and rude about everything; but then I took a look at some of your other posts and found out that that’s basically 75% of what you do so thanks for that *eye roll*
---
To everyone else, thanks for the offers I will definitely check out your corporations in a day or two once I get a feel for the game again.
---
Is that scanning? Special ops ships?
---
Net Profit YoY -1.1%
---
Clarification: by "faction sites that will blow up" this dude means so-called "ghost sites" also known as "covert research facilities". Regular faction relics and data are fine.

Cool alliance videos by the way!
---
In wormhole we basically do PVP, scanning is super important, using bookmarks and mapping 3rd party websites like tripwire. I also do exploration on the side, keep an eye open for potential kills, and we do the occasionnal c5 ratting.
---
it's a subscription based game.
---
alpha clones are just trial accounts that don't expire - temper your expectations as such.
---
I agree. But CCP isn't making standings
---
&gt;Most people aren't stupid. They aren't going to risk their shiny toys when the chance of death is almost guaranteed. Adapting to this is to outright not participate in PVE in null. 
---
Perhaps if they used strategies and coordinated their PVE they wouldn't have a guaranteed death.
---
Even the beariest of bears (high sec incursion runners) have 40 dudes on TS to keep the fleet safe.

---
standings are irrelevant. the game mechanics don't promote any reason to shoot each other.
---
&gt;relatively high actual membership requirements.
---
If you believe this, you are objectively high.
---
Oh look, another anti-blackout post.
---
Neither does every alliance leader, diplo, and FC being friends in discord.
---
which has nothing to do with the game or it's mechanics.
---
look at boxers, friends outside of the ring but will gladly punch the living daylights out of each other - if the game has a reason to hurt each other, people will. being friends does not stop that.
---
Your standing with the FW Corp gives you a militia rank.
---
When you pass each 1 standing, you get promoted. When this happens you get faction standing. A significant amount.
---
More than likely no. More than likely they have yet to figure out why the chat server keeps acting up therefore this is a good reason to leave it until it's fixed in 2-3 years.
---
Instead of going after something like procurer bait you will just have to avoid all cloakies. By the time you realize what is happening it's going to be too late.
---
Yeah, null should be wildlands, not more secure than highsec with automatic intel bots posting ships/locations 10 jumps from where you rat/mine under a super umbrella with no risk.
---
Not to mention that the economy is going to start to recover now as well.
---
So what you're saying is beans fought HK randomly and lost and inner hell decided to evict them while they were down...?
---
Thank you for pointing that out.
---
You're casting the blame on the wrong party.
---
People gave CCP good suggestions and well-reasoned feedback, but CCP ignored it. After years of this, people realized CCP wasn't going to listen to them, and the expectation of being ignored is incorporated into the tone and phrasing of their suggestions now.  It's called "mockery".
---
Virtually ANYONE will eventually resort to acting "childish" when you treat them like children long enough - not only is there no reason to bother with niceties when the party you're addressing isn't going to listen anyways, but mockery can potentially force its hand. Hilmar might be perfectly happy to watch EVE burn now that it doesn't affect him all that much, but if enough attention is drawn to his hilariously blatant negligence and his attempt to basically scam PA, he might very well start caring.
---
This is the gayest thing I've ever seen.
---
lol 300 bombers will alpha munins (and pretty much anything else besides supers). esp if they are dumb and hit their adc before the torps arrive
---
Nope not all came. Sad to not be able to hang with the ones that chose not to but I get why.
---
I would describe booshing ravens as a hunting doctrine if that was the only place that we saw them. yes.
---
This is what experts refer to as a Crynosural Field.

---
First off, there isn't really "winning". This is a standard that you need to figure out for yourself.
---
But the game IS omega. Alpha is just a long trial period. You can do a lot in Alpha though.
---
Thank you for realizing how fucked up you sound, yes *technically* a company can choose to loose a lot of % over night.I am sure that will go down famously in the media. Reason and good will always triumph in the end, glad you found yours.

:D
---
Get that gate yet?
---
or you know, classic wow.... for the time being, at the very least is a huge contributor to this.
---
(youll also notice if you look at playergraphs, there is a dip every time a major release of another game hits. i wonder why)
---
Nope, CCP is busy killing the game
---
It's that thing you light up when a good ingame friend dies in rl
---
Nobody said blackout would solve all the problems.
---
They said it would bring more risk to nullsec.
---
Which it did.
---
It absolutely succeeded in doing that.
---
Nullsec ratting incomes are down significantly and ships destroyed was equal or higher.
---
And no, blackout still was mostly hated by this sub when it happened, primary big krab empires.
---
You could do something else other than only hunting ratters.
---
But it's odd you say people aren't ratting, when bombers bar is still getting as many kills now as before.
---
What are the negative effects of the blackout?
---
It still has enormous support, it's supporters just don't have a reason to constantly post about it because it is already deployed.
---
Meanwhile it's haters think if the bitch loud enough on Reddit CCP will reverse it.
---
GF! eve giveth and eve taketh... it would have been nicer if the dread was taken 15 minutes later, I'm sure a lot of dudes on that grid were having more fun than me.
---
After watching a few other solo dread fights, I can't help but wonder how much dps would have been wasted on cruisers that could tank/escape quick enough, though as a few people have said, there were some choice kills in there (kikimora, talos, etc)
---
I hope for more content in the future!
---
You live in a cartoon world.
---
Nobody is remotely doing that.
---
Pity. Was my first corp circa 2005, ran with them in lowsec chasing pirates and later in the bad old ASCN days. Don't think there's more than 2-3 of the original crew left playing tbh, assuming Tessa's still kicking around.
---
Think... did you have a few drinks...
---
Plenty of bots have though.
---
15000 in the first half of 2019 alone.
---
Hm, new pirate ships when?
---
Also where will SOE ships come from after that?
---
I had something distantly similar - one of my ships had damaged shields every time I logged in after a safe logout in space with full shields. Bug report created.
---
If you're impatient - yes. A lot of it is just waiting, some speculation. Buy X and sell later.
---
I've literally made billions off of just going "Hey a war starting in tribute" and buying antimatter, then selling to the dry market at an almost 200% markup.
---
Your willingness to reference the disadvantaged nature of a low charging sex worker to sensationalize your post tells me its your compassion that's whats actually broken.

RIPBet
---
Most of those questions go into the no question is stupid thread though. Protects the person who is asking from being downvoted to hell.
---
This particular question also shows the difficulties when moving to eve from other games. It's usually categorized as an MMORPG. While it is that, it doesn't really work like the other games which are categorized the same. Having the label on eve let's people expect that they go through quests and so on. One of the many many reasons why the retention rate is so low.
---
I can't say it's ever been less efficient to just buy plex.
---
It's technology that turns liquid ozone into a bunch of angry nerds who are either in wrong fleet or jump into a wrong system and then your ship asplodes.
---
It's auto-targeting missiles, launched by mission runner in 2003.
---
&gt; The team needed some training 
---
Like fighting Inner Hell wasn't spooky before; now they say they started training :-(
---
&gt; they are the only things people remember in this game
---
I do remember a ton of fights in this game and they have three things in common:
---
- they won't be remembered in EvE history
---
- I wasn't an F1 monkey
---
- they were fun and Tidi free
---
I'll pick these fights everyday over "the historical ones".
---
I welcome our new ai overlords.
---
Huh. At first I thought it could it be a bot using the [warp info exploit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cyvq7y/big_bug_eve_client_receives_information_about/), but you'd have to have warped to him to trigger it and see him in the overview for a split second.
---
English, please.
---
I was living in a wh for a while, the guys that ran it had built a fortizar in the hole and someone was going to get a fax and a dread built for home defense. We ended up moving out before that happened though, and I'm not sure where the fortizar went, it was probably sold to someone who wanted to keep living there.
---
The problem with building capitals in that type of hole is that they're completely overkill for any of the anomalies that can spawn. A haw dread is good for home defense, but it will still die to triglavian ships' dps. Plus having someone with a dread in your hole could mean they stab you in the back and turn your structures into loot pinatas.
---
And guess what , YOU can even make them lower ;)
---
They were about as independent as the QFC
---
thanks :)
---
So can you!
---
Visit Delve one day, you'll see a lot of juicy targets, who are supposedly "aren't ratting"
---
A corpmate suggested he might be in the Sun.
---
I don't know if it would cause this. I remember warping to a scanned entity inside the sun before: my ship warped inside the sun first and then it catapulted out.
---
Seems to be different.
---
They've had it for a couple of months, but it's still very neat.
---
Activity is flooding around? Good
---
More tears, please. Did someone kill your rorqual again?
---
Please check out the details of my corp  "v o i d - g a t e" in game. (you have to set it to an "exact terms" search in the "people and places" window to find it) We are a new all alpha corp.
---
I like how you're ignoring the effect of WoW classic
---
Are you intentionally being stupid or do you not know what average player count is?
---
I don't think WoW classic has had that much of an effect.  The numbers have been trending down way before wow classic.
---
It just bottomed out at 12,100. Last week it was 1k more at the same time. The week before that it was 2k more. The week before that it was 3k more. It was higher still before the chaos era, but I got depressed and stopped looking.
---
How low does it have to go before everyone realizes that this is a disaster?
---
CCP hasn't fixed or even acknowledged any of the real issues with the game. Citadel spam is broken. Ship balance is broken from frigates to titans. Risk/reward for all kinds of PVE are totally out of whack everywhere, not just nullsec.
---
Regardless of your personal, uniformed, shitty opinion one way or another, this needs to stop, right now. Before permanent damage sets in. The status quo is better than freefalling concurrent user counts.
---
Ghost TZ is already dead, there's literally fuck-all going on anywhere. AUTZ is next. If this keeps up for a few more weeks, we're going to lose critical mass in USTZ too.
---
Anyone who regularly plays in ghost TZ (ultra late USTZ, ultra early AUTZ) can tell you first hand how terrible that timezone is for content in general, and now the other timezones are heading EXACTLY into that ballpark.
---

Look for yourself dumbass.

Eve servers haven't broken 30k in almost a month now.
---
Incase you are too stupid to figure it out you slide the graph back to 05-06 you mongoloid
---
Rogue drones have had this logo for over a year. At least since May 2018.
---
This
---
3 month subs are simply running out
---
The Iteron(itty) had three armor repair modules(triple-repped) and two capacitor booster modules.  In order to avoid a CONCORD response and engage the Megathron(mega), the Iteron looted a wreck from the mission the Megathron was running(wreckflip). The Megathron had no active repair modules(buffer tanked). The Iteron started by killing the Megathron's drones(defanged), using the cap boosters to keep its armor repairs up. Once the drones were down, it used an energy neutralizer to drain the Megathron's capacitor(neuted) and turn off its guns, leaving it completely helpless.
---
Good. All the isk sinks are leaving all the bots gone.   
---
All thats left are people who actually want to blow shit up and risk something.   
---
This will bring more people in to the game. Its never been so fun IMO.
---
So nowdays the game is about Delve? I thought there are other areas and players as well
---
Thank you.🙂
---
I just provided an example of a content zone. Don't be meticulous
---
But Hilmar is gunna save us, plus our new Korean Overlords! /s
---
But yeah, Hilmar bringing his ugly mug back into EVE to suck even more life out of it to generate more cash for that scumbag to meet the profitability is shady af. CCP has always been the worst thing to happen to the game.
---
You are fucking retarded if you think bots have left the game
---
The way you "win" EVE is to quit playing, and that doesn't require any specific type of subscription.
---
&gt;I don’t want to commit to the game further if the only way to advance is to buy omega time.
---
After 5Mn SP the only way to get more SP is through Daily Alpha Injectors. After 20Mn SP the only way to get more SP is by buying Omega. You seem to think that Omega is some "premium" feature, it isn't. It's the regular game, and Alpha is the trial. EVE is not a F2P game, it is a P2P game with an exceedingly generous free trial.
---
\&gt;  this actually is a good idea
---
Thanks!
---
\&gt;  No matter how much that value actually is, people will argue it's either  to high or too low, while at the same time finding multiple ways to  circumvent it (plastic wraps, items in containers in ships, just  deploying a new citadel once you reach asset safety limit)
---
Dropping new citadels exposes them to hacking, as one cannot defend many empty citadels. Citadels scale linearly with local population.
---
Plastic wraps/unknown items are never covered by asset safety. Fix the container in ships bug.
---
\&gt; Yes, I would like to hack into the TTT and get myself some PLEX, but in  general this is a terrible idea, considering there are groups that do  not cover multiple  timezones all the time.
---
You must go to war with them. They must fail to defend or properly fit the TTT. Max-skill hacking is never more than 0.01% of the citadel's content. Then you have to get it out.   
---
Timezones are solved just as with sov: you can define vulnerability windows.
---
\&gt;  a good idea might be a linear decrease in asset safety payment
---
That is a good idea!
---
\&gt;  Apart from all the other reasons why removing ISK from the wallet of  other players is a bad idea, this can be easily rendered useless by  sending your ISK to another character after ratting (unless you want to  neg-wallet people).
---
It's a bad idea, I agree. Too complicated. Something similar exists and has proven bad.
---
You pretty much hit the nail on the head.
---
The way THEY see it, though, in their own little delusional worlds, is that they are amazingly skilled and deserve to kill other people. They aren't getting free kills, they "earn" those kills by lucking their way into finding afk or otherwise non-alert players who can't put up a fight (er, excuse me, it's only "luck" when they don't find someone to faceroll to death; when there DOES happen to be someone offering themselves up as a free killmail in the right system, finding them was "skill"). Anyone who suggests that their killboard stats are the result of anything but pure skill needs to "adapt or die, scrub" - after all, if you weren't less skilled than them, your VNI wouldn't have died to their t3/bomber gang, right?
---
Once the players who provided the easy kills have either quit or adapted, the tards no longer get as many killmails as they feel entitled to and the game becomes "unfair". Once CCP "fixes" the "unfairness" by making it even easier to gank the miners/ratters/haulers that remain, the game is fine again and anyone who complains needs to "adapt or die, scrub" (at least until the newly-easy targets get sick of the bs and follow in their predecessor's footsteps).
---
Basically, they tend to view themselves as the progamers of EVE and consider something to be wrong with the game when they, despite their amazing ~~inclination towards ganking targets that present no challenge~~ skill, they aren't getting the killboard stats that they feel that such "pros" deserve.
---
&gt;No matter how much that value actually is, people will argue it's either to high or too low, while at the same time finding multiple ways to circumvent it (plastic wraps, items in containers in ships, just deploying a new citadel once you reach asset safety limit)
---
The most valuable escalations are regions away, out of reach of your coalition's jump bridge network.
---
Apparently not r/iamverybadass enough to figure out how to find content...
---
I suppose steroids *do* rot your brain.
---
Good point. And ESS sucks, right? Nix that last from my fantasy Chaos Era Eve.
---
MCAV is recruiting.
---
I only have mine out if I'm logged in on my main doing something actually interesting. So I only lose drones.
---
There's a reason why you only see the badly fit ones. The people who actually want to play the game and know enough to fit their ships competently are paying enough attention to warp off within the first few minutes.
---
Somewhere in the midwest? I've seen them all over my campus as well
---
The missions will go onnnnn and onnnnn and onnnnn until you get bored of them and head out to Nul Sec
---
I kind of feel like we should be insulted by that, but it's just so ACCURATE....
---
I agree. Sedentary PVE should be about resource extraction and heavy industry. Sov should be about enabling this.  
---
All shooting PVE should be about adventure and teamwork in a big, dangerous galaxy. Like exploration.
---
It is nice to imagine, isn't it? Where's my game designer offer!
---
I miss eve bet the most. I made a good bit on AT and i lost so much more betting on hockey.
---
I agree with Plebius. Some compromise between danger and flexibility needs to be found. The assets are out of the bag.
---
Cheers Faymm :)
---
If you prefer more sedentary, self-directed PVE, may I suggest mining (and from there, climbing the value chain to market PVP)? I am surprised with players who genuinely enjoy anomaly ratting. Do you?
---
No need to be so surprised :)
---
It is not.
---
agh i know man i really do need to commit on that will up my game just need to stay commited on it knowing i might lose some engaments because of it but will be good for the long run.
---
Chaos! Just Chaos!
---
That terrarium is in zero gravity. Don’t let them loose!

It would have made more sense to buy out Neocom and brand that. Although the skill training bit would have been missing...

Chaos just for chaos sake is just chaos.

&lt;3 that was awesome!  TY good sir
---
I like my krab with extra spicy mayo.
---
I'm curious of bots are good enough to go kill the ESS or can you just take all their money that way?
---
I'm almost compelled to just put aside my shitposting and karma tank the "u salty / null bear tears / \~insert other played-out meme here\~" to do a long winded write up about how CCP is only hearing the loudest voices and not the most valuable voices. Yes, there needs be changes - it's very apparent super umbrellas ruin the fun and killing dumb krabz should be just a ...wtf am I saying - both of those can be countered if you understand any sort of patience, effort, and strategy. 
---
I have played EVE for over a decade, it's deppressing to say but it's essentially a significant part of my life just as much as the EVE community is. It's very saddening to see EVE go out so fast in such a terribly misguided way. The playerbase is older - they just aren't going to put up with wreckless shit like this. With that said time will only tell what permanent damage was done by these wreckless changes and implimentations. We're already seeing the results of people letting Omega accounts run out and those run-outs are finally starting to show. 
---
Yes, the game needs changes. CCP really REALLY needs to take a step back and listen to the CSM - except for Olmeca-type CSMs, he had synonymous ideas to what's currently being introduced to the game and look where we are lmao. I really want to see all the screachers take a step back a go "oh shit, maybe we were wrong... maybe we should have supported the overall quieter voices in motivating CCP to introduce gradual changes that would lead to a better atmosphere for all". No one here on r/eve seems to have the foresight that would allow them to predict what atrocities these changes / upcoming changes would deliver. Hell, people are mass riding-out their Omega statuses just based on the cyno change ANNOUNCEMENTS alone - just think what happens when they are actually implimented!
---
There were A LOT of people who ate up enough plex to last a couple months BEFORE black out and cyno change announcements, we are now starting to see the result of all those players choosing not to continue Omega. We are entering the dark ages of EVE, the real slope is about to begin as everyone let's their Omega status lapse, and the true disaster that these changes are will be seen in full light. 
---
Enjoy the data site heron bots and frigate low sec mission bots, it will probably be the only content you find.

Wait till I catch you at a relic site with my astero. Do you think 50mil is expensive? My astero fit costs over 400mil and can tank solo sabres. It has paid itself off at least 10 times over in the last month alone.
---
But one thing is that bashing structures in conflict that creates fights.
---
But if there is no incentive to attack a structure, there is also no incentive to really defend them.
---
Meaning no conflict is made.
---
Without asset safety, or partial asset safety, you could poke stations to get real defensive fleets, and if nobody came you'd get loot.
---
Right now defending is purely about waving your dick, same with attacking.

The irony coming from someone who uses cloaky blackops frigates and MJD destroyers to reduce the probability of losing ships to a near 0% and then scurry off back into a small wormhole if a target puts up even the minimal resistance.

there is no if, marshy is just retarded

Yeah sure, now you have a code... You guys have become the new HK of wh space, just embrace your reality and stop triying to make it look like you know what "honor" means.
---
Keep pissing off more people, you're only painting a huge target on your asses.
---
You're even worse than the goons, at least they live up to the "yeah I'm an asshole, so what?" mentality. IH on the other hand are just a bunch of Hypocrites.
---
You get the info when the warp initiates, not when the ship lands.
---
Citadels, asset safety and free instant caps all together have  been such a shit that caused the game like half the population despite making it accessible for complete idiots.
---
Dude your attitude narrating these fights is so much fun, you sound like you're just having a hell of a time. love your vids dude, keep it up :D
---
Yep, think mine has about 6 weeks left.
---
Not sure if I'm going to bother resubbing. I've barely played since the black out as it is. Although that's not entirely down to the black out, but it sure as shit hasn't helped.
---
That water is mostly piss at this point. Better to fill it with fresh. And by piss I mean the spoiled brats and bittervets.
---
Hey but those middle school players have a lot of fun now!        
---
If CCP focus on the older players they will just die out eventually.
---
3 of my subs are running out in in like 3-4 days ^(whoooo before cyno fuckup), the last one have still like 6-7 months.
---
I only have 1 omega left.

If i wanted constantly look behind if someone is not there i would move to WH space years ago.        
---
People that i hunt are also mostly gone, damn even CCP bumping changes mean that i will be not able to block NCPL jf moving around higsec and force them to jump out or pay me.

^(i build up northern dread cache from this isk :D)
---
He also means Sleeper relic and data sites, like "

**Forgotten Frontier Quarantine Outpost** " or " **Unsecured Frontier Receiver** ". Sites with Sansha, guristas and other main pirate faction in their names are fine to do without getting blapped by scary sleepers.
---
Too bad, as soon as you hit -200 you won't be able to post here anymore
---
Ooo story time?
---
It's always the whitespace.
---
It's getting worse.
---
Why wouldn't we be ratting?
---
It is a long known bug and exploit CCP can't/has no time to fix.
---
He is at a spot that cannot be reached. Every celestial has 0 spot where everyone lands, there us also buffer (celestial diameter) zone that takes you to that spot regardless of where you managed to make the bookmark between 2 spits. He has probably burned in that spot untill he is off grid and stayed there. So even if you probe his exact spot, the game prevents you from directly warping there and lands you at 0 on the celestial.
---
 If you know the player, you could report him, but there is no way yo know that for sure and yo know if that ship is boarded at all.
---
The dude above said that "the non-botting ratters aren’t ratting". I provided an example of the opposite
---
You cant do this due to legal resons. Good idea but nope.
---
Open Eve offline.        
---
Take 1 week before announcement of this  bulshit we are in now, and look at online numbers then, after this take last whole week and look at the data.            
---
You will see that not only online numbers are lower ^(i know all are bots and krabs, but i hunted those krabs) but also shape of the graph is different.          
---
You can clearly see that pre blackout graph is smooth as people that logged in played longer, the daily graphs for last days show that people login just to do 1-2 things and logout.  They don't play the game any more.     
---
They are no longer in space and active ... and this is bad for any MMO.
---
Yeah, the thing is though that gambling is genuinely evil and affects you outside of the game by fact of getting you addicted to the act of *gambling*.
---
You win when you biomass........and set fire to your pc
---
&gt;btw: downvoting simply cause you don't like the cyno change in general won't help the bigger picture.
---
I'm still gonna do it.
---
If you saw our intel channels, you'd realize the stupidity of what you said. I can assure you that if there are bots in there, I don't see them. What we have is people freaking out over anything at all on dscan all day long.
---
My last one is a titan pilot that i was skilling for last 2 years  ... it even don't have titan book yet :D  or gunnery as i was slowly maxing out the basics.            
---
Funny enough hull is already waiting.     
---
Having 2 titans on separate accounts is quite fun for bridging yourself.
---
I would work to reduce the impact that killboards have on the game; much of the predatory gameplay encouraged by killboards is extremely toxic - for every player who is happy with the game because he gets high stats on zkill by ganking and blobbing, there are FAR more unhappy players who aren't having fun because of him. 
---
Killboards are, unfortunately, an inseparable part of the game now and pulling them out would likely only speed its death. There's no reason that their influence has to be ubiquitous, though - if the killmail system only worked with players who chose ahead of time to participate or only in certain parts of space, EVE could accommodate a variety of playstyles. There are many reasons people could want to play EVE: scifi fans might love flying spaceships and participating in the kind of space politics and wars they watch on tv, some players might enjoy industry and being able to produce every item in the game, some players might enjoy building their own empire, and yet other players might enjoy the realistic logistical aspects of EVE - EVE is theoretically a sandbox, and could theoretically accommodate all of these playstyles and more.
---
Unfortunately, CCP envisions one specific playstyle as dominant over all others: forcing other players into one-sided and non-consentual pvp, otherwise known as ganking. There's nothing inherently wrong with this playstyle; both ganking and being in danger of being ganked can be fun - I considered world pvp to be one of the best aspects of WoW before Blizzard removed it.

The problem with ganking in EVE is that CCP goes much too far in enabling and rewarding it, to the point where it renders other forms of gameplay unfun and unrewarding, if not outright impossible. If you were to write out a list of all activities you can think of in EVE, then cross out the ones that you "can't" do because you'd get ganked too often, you'd end up with a very long list with very few options left. The main problem isn't even the fact that people CAN gank you at any time, it's that CCP automatically places a reward on your head that ensures most people WILL gank you if given the opportunity - and the absurd number and nature of the things that constitute such opportunities makes the process of avoiding would-be gankers horribly tedious and unfun.
---
Most game companies have the wisdom to recognize toxic gameplay as being bad for the health of their game, and they ban players for such behavior. Obviously, people ganking in EVE aren't breaking a rule and don't deserve to be banned, but the fact that such behavior is BANNABLE in most games should at least suggest to CCP that maybe it shouldn't infect their ENTIRE game. 
---
Creating areas of space where players can either learn the game or just enjoy it the way they want, without killmail-farmers ruining their gameplay experience for the sake of numbers on a killboard, would greatly broaden EVE's popular appeal without any real drawback. Currently, if you aren't part of the small minority of gamers who enjoy the CCP-approved style of gameplay, your only option is to go play another game - but if CCP were to pull their collective heads out of their asses and withdraw their ultimatum of "our way or the highway", they could retain those players and possibly even lure them back into killmail farmville at a later date.
---
The only real downside would be flash flooding from the river of tears the "elite pvp" kids cried at this, but at the end of the day, they aren't any worse off for not being able to farm someone for killmails because that person is in a no-km zone/state than they would be if that person left for another game - and EVE itself would be better off with more players and more income.
---
Well then it doesn't really make sense for them to be complaining that they haven't had a fun roam in weeks, since clearly barely anyone finds it fun. Although that being said, the skeleton crew don't do much in the way of timer warfare either.
---
Gratz, you’ve found a 3 years old dev test mod.
---
The pool should be labeled "blue doughnut tears".
---
However
---
No. Fuck off. Gambling in video games needs to die.
---
Something something GTA V
---
Also this is just concurrent users logging in. We could argue that it actualy probably translates to roughly 20k accounts with alts etc..
---
Now add into the mix that 1 in 20 accounts will buy 1 plex package per month... 
---
The revenue loss will be staggering to the company.
---
&gt; Good. All the isk sinks are leaving all the bots gone.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; All thats left are people who actually want to blow shit up and risk something.
---
&gt; This will bring more people in to the game. Its never been so fun IMO.           
---
This is just dumb.     
---
1. Like players are not isk sinks ... they generate isk this way or another.  Isk sink you have in form of LP store, NPC taxes and so on.                      
---
2. Well sure, maybe ? Like you first need 'something' to blow up something, and from what i noticed people recently put up a lot on field in opposite to hungers using destroyers and bombers.        
---
So hmmmmm.               
---
3. Problem with EVE is that it is a very niche game. Over the years i invited many people that i know.  Like most of them didn't stay long and usually they just told me after this 'this is not my kind of game'     
---
Because EVE is different.       
---
It is not only about NPE but about simple fact that not many players like spaceships that they cannot fly with like in ED, not many like the aspect of losing all 'their gear' each time they die.        
---
Like CCP stated very small percentage of players stay - i will argue that ceding so many players is very bad for us.        
---
Especially that i know we are not only loosing alts ^(don't care about those tbh, for me there should be upper limit how many chars can be logged at the same time) but also real people.      
---
A lot of them.
---
I play  in late us/early au.  We're getting 5-15 bill in kills a night.  Maybe you'd have more content if you weren't in the most built up region in the game?
---
Not new, quite old.
---
GTFO with gambling in games ... ^(it is not gambling ... it is surprise mechanics)
---
Imagine picking on the fucking Mighty Beans while they're on their knees and calling it training
---
I wonder when Inner Hell will try to evict an actually competent group like NoVac, birds, horses, or i dunno the tentacles probably. Tentacles arent too competenet tho but theres a million of em.
---
Oh I misread that, my bad. By all means help us clean out any bots!
---
Frankly it works this way in every big ass alliance out there, their entire existence is based on one or two people be it Progod and Vily (fortunately more Vily nowdays), Mittens, Elise, Elo (BL broke up several times when he decided to ninja vanish), Sort (even iam not realy sure here) Carneros or Vince for us, whether they even log in or not matters not as long as they are "visible" for minions on comms or in any other way. So yeah, gigx would be the only way to put that back together.
---
Gambling is an inherent part of any mmorpg
---
Any act of aquire ing in-game resources is a gamble comprised of latest Gameplay mechanics updates, your knowledge on efficiency and most importantly chance of drop.
---
Time is a far more valuable commodity.
---
People that have no self control on wasting away money on gambles will find a different money sink anyway
---
Only girl dancers? Sounds like this idea is based off your personal masturbatory heteronormative patriarchal fever dream but ok...
---
What are you killing?
---
Then this needs to change and gambling needs to get the fuck out. Oh, and if 
---
&gt;People that have no self control on wasting away money on gambles will find a different money sink anyway
---
then they should find it and stay away from games.
---
&gt; My name is Kara Korbrey and I`m PR manager of INNER HELL.
---
Man I gotta be honest, you're not doing a very good job because almost everyone in eve hates y'all vOv
---
Also just actually read the post, you didn't pay someone to pull the items out but they mysteriously happened right before y'all come in with a huge fleet to evict us -- you also didn't get paid but people who had a grudge with the beans were mysteriously allowed in with your main fleet vOv
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Bombers Bar are whalers, hunting big targets under super umbrellas. Practically nothing has changed there, as the blackout only really affects subcaps and/or people outside super umbrellas. - BB are a very bad example when it comes to the effects of the blackout.
---
The people primarily hit by this were the subcap PVEers living *outside* of those super umbrellas. The people who normal roamers and blopsers target. (You know, hunters who can't field 100+ bombers and dozens of 24/7 campers to get them targets.)
---
*Those* PVEers are practically non-existent now, as the effort-vs-reward involved in setting up PVE ops in those null areas is laughable. The amount of effort, pilots and mind-numbing tedium you have to go through to get the tiniest amounts of ISK out of null now (again: excluding supers under super-umbrellas) makes basically all other ISK making methods preferable.
---
So yea. People keep whining at them to adapt. They did. Turns out, the best way to adapt was to go do something else. - Careful what you wish for...
---
-70% resistance... 🤔👌
---
Sounds like item that CCP should introduce in Chaos Era
---
Quantum intricacy, where two systems A and B and are considered as a whole as forming a single system S. Slasher.
---
There's a few of us out there playing, and more of us than you'd think out in null, we just don't show our faces and voices much.
---
Personally I'm not out in null, although I venture there for some of my PvP fix. 
---
I tend to stick to low/high and abyssal space because I don't get as much time as I used to to play - my BF is a pretty hardcore gamer so we spend a lot of time splitting our efforts between a few titles that we can play together.
---
I have the same problem in EVE - I can't do voice given how much I've been on stage for CCP. I'd be outed instantly and that's not a place you want to be, because you just get spammed and harassed in game to the point where you can't play.
---
Well capital bots left the game mostly so this is good.        
---
But if this was the goal of the CCP - then they used a nuke to kill the elephant.         
---
Sure they managed to do it, but the fallout is now killing every thing else around.
---
Learn basic 2nd grade grammar first and I might take you serious
---
1v1 at the Su... aaaaAHGHHHHHHGHGHHH
---
Good analize here ;)
---
The first nerf was not so big to fuel isk for pvp.
---
 The BO yes.
---
I blame this subreddit for most of the problems on eve.  
---
Be part of the solution and stop acting like you want it to die.
---
My biggest win back in 2011 or 2012 on blink is when they had a massive prize draw and waking up to find i had won a full decked out Nyx. 
---
Was a high sec noob and didn't have the skills to use it so ended up cashing it in for 40 odd billion or something. Most of that went back into them plus i stopped playing late 2012 
---
Started back up 2 months ago with friends only to find my accounts all locked and someone had stripped all of my ships but a nice gm was able to track some of it and reimbursed me for some of them that he could track.
---
Looking back i was even gambling and constantly watching for promo's even at work and dropping a couple hundred $$$$ a week into it. So much money wasted but it was fun.
---
I see one major flaw in this analogy: the guy actually hit the target *as well* as the pool. CCP only hit the pool.
---
GTFO my daily blackout/cyno salt thread with your  unpopular opinion reeeee
---
Every serious corporation living in a low class WH (C1-C4) have a cap fleet for home def at least. caps can't come from outside, they are build and will die in the same hole.
---
Almost as if blackout wasn't meant to 100% fix everything. We need constant iterations to make things better and better.
---
&gt;grammer
---
Same
---
Just want to say thank you to everyone who sent video. That's some good stuff. Thanks!
---
Missions are the same, but hisec now has invasions and pirate strongholds. Also moons with the best regular ores ingame.
---
If you want to fly with my corp send me a mail ingame (Gitzo Gutface) and ill invite you, we are in hisec next to low and null for access to all types of content.
---
See you!
---
But you are already part of a blue donut Panfam coalition - why try to make out you are an independent alliance?
---
This is actually pretty sad to see tbh, I had some fun fighting against them a few years back.
---
What are you talking about. We are EVE players. Of course we want it to die. It's who we are. And we want to be there, to whore on the kill and shittalk it as it goes down.
---
Did you heard about gta online ? They added the exact same thing you are describing   go play it there  keep gambling out of eve  we have jita scammers already thats bad enough
---
Could work in lowsec if its &lt;2 second align
---
who says i'll be wanking on dancers.... i also mentioned military personnel.... not so patriarchal now, am i!
---
mainly wh space and null
---
Use a heron there
---
out of curioisty what is this fit?
---
What about womenly men and manly women?
---
Abyssal bots live in high sec and they just run Tier 3's all day long.. But continuing to deny the problem is not going to make it go away,
---
I myself have been running an abyssal bot and a Null sec bot for roughly 6 - 14 hours a day... The abysal bot has been going from 2 months in and the Null bot for 18 months now.
---
* Null bot has died to NPC's only a handful of times.
---
* Abys bot's died due to a power cut we had.
---
I will release the data on both bots one day, I will expose them or expose them when caught... FYI if CCP listening, both are Alpha's.. 
---
Lastly - Both bots will never share their isk with anyone. This is simply an experiment to show how fucking inept CCP Security actually are..
---
"Gambling in video games needs to die."
---
lets keep all the fun stuff in game like cloaking
---
Yesterday around 11:00 UTC I saw it was 0 people online. Eve must really suck these days, hahaha
---
So mods became useless but restrictive? Just like ccp, eh?
---
There are some tasty flavours of denial in this thread.
---
* There's plain, dry denial that players are leaving.
---
* There's the classic, savoury "it's just bots leaving"
---
* Then there's that rather salty, "we don't need krabs they're ruining the game"
---
* Then there's the, juicy "I'm getting more kills than ever and so are all my friends who resubbed just cause if the blackout even though stats show kills are down we're getting so many more so many lots and lots and lots and so is everyone else".
---
You dropped the /s
---
Cant really make that claim after the blackout
---
Actually wow would be a small addition.
---
Every year since 2012 has been a decrease. This decrease in players has accelerated as the years have ticked over.
---
I predicted the lowest summer in the history of EVE based on just data and assumptions derived from it from historical years. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c1tgto/is_eve_really_dying_or_will_it_just_be_a_forever/
---
Except they aren’t a new group, they’re Panfam meatshields living in The Spire - and supposedly a premier PvP alliance (or that’s how they like to portray themselves).
---
The thing I hate about it most is ship fitting (or any other task) and the effects of multitasking. 
---
When you switch apps or go to the home screen, upon returning to the app it shows you back to the character screen and refuses to save your progress.
---
Resets like this and starting from scratch every time suck
---
Depends what you want to do, 2.2b in plex is pretty good starting buffer. I would also suggest finding a corp aligned with your interests. /r/Evejobs is a pretty good place to look as well as the official forums.
---
A quick glimpse at post history indicates this person is being serious lmao
---
YOU ARE PART OF A BIG BLOCK!!! Stop trying to make out you are some kind of small independent alliance. You only have that space because your coalition Panfam blobbed Unspoken and JAG out of the area so you could krab in peace.
---
Why would someone like that even play video games?
---
No trust me. It is a genuine question.
---
Not literally waking. Masturbatory as an adjective "Excessively self-indulgent or self-involved"
---
My point being was that you have only girl dancers in your concept as if content implemented by ccp should only appeal to the male gaze. 
---
Where's the inclusivity? Can I get a male military personel to get up on stage and shake it for me if I buy him enough drinks and make it rain?
---
Don't quit your day job.
---
Happy to help :)
---
Adapt or die or die
---
2003-2016 ... i now wish i could have some of that time back. It's like Heroin, taking you on one hell of a ride, giving you shitty lows, and once you're off you realize that there are so much better things (and games) out there and how inherently flawed eve was and still is and that it's only the community itlself clinging on that keeps the game alive and leads to the devs believe they know what they are doing.  
---
A loyal community like eve would be able to make the devs of Fallout 76 look like geniuses to themselves.
---
You brought more titans than they even had capitals...
---
Gj
---
Nice to see them do something for once as Test disco dance their way through the rest of the region. No doubt that will be replaced today
---
Bait success? :thinking:
---
Maybe this have impact on the smallest guys, but clearly not on the big ones, who already have insane amount of money and resources. Fuck up the game for some regular guys not fix the economy.
---
Also: do you have any idea how an intel bot would work? What do you think, how much difference it have when it have to watch the overview instead of the local list? Yeah, a little less secure.
---
But instead of kicking left and right to solve a problem, they should just make (or buy) an anticheat system like many other mmo (even if those not perfect either). That would be some effort against the botters.
---
Someone write an AAR, or heck repost it with a decent title.
---
Gotta say not the worst bait. Got to complacwnt with the amount of easy kills delivered by the astra lol
---
why no dead vanquisher?
---
Such is life in nullsec

Is it that time of day again? You know, the time for "players are leaving, game is dying" post? I was worried we might have a whole day pass without one being posted :)
---
P.S Also, the meme would be more accurate if there were turds floating in the pool and the guy was trying to fish them out, but then decides to empty, clean and refill the pool instead.
---
Its perfectly fine. They did wanted chaos
---
GG, convincing bait. SRP already paid out, would jump again.
---
Spot on!
---
Capsuleer log-off timer can be extended to keep a player in one place until the next server shutdown which can be significantly longer than 6 hours, but obviously there is no way to safe log during this time
---
Honestly, like the easiest bait to even do.
---
GF
---
Yeah and eves dead cause blackout.
---
The water needed to be changed anyway. Nothing bad about filling the pool with fresh water.
---
&gt; we killed 30 dreads with 30 titans 💪

&gt; not even a single titan died this time 😲

&gt; op success 💪

Nice bait, it was a nicely done 👍
---
To make short, a memo for beginner explorers:
---
Relic and data sites with words "Sansha", "Guristas", "Serpentis", "Angel" or "Blood Raider" in their name are "safe" (have no agressive NPC in them and won't try to harm your ship in any way, but you still could be attacked by other players), UNLESS they also have words "Covert Research Facility" there.
---
There is also two other types of data sites - they are rare and dangerous, but potentially profitable for explorer/hacker. First is earlier mentioned "Covert Research Facilitiy", second is "Sleeper Cache". They require special tactics to run them safely and it's generally adviced for newbies to avoid them. But actually look for info, do some research and you would be able to run them too. It just requires knowledge and carefulness.
---
All other types of relic or data sites have absolutely no interest for lone explorer/hacker.
---
Suddenly........
---
Great app! Now give us PI ;)

new vanquisher is Ready

Are there others who think I should move this thread? I don’t use Reddit much but I did read the rules for eve sub ahead of time and as soon as I clicked on that mods name I saw a recent comment of his saying this is a Christian sub Reddit???
---
Anyway that seems sketchy so I muted. Feedback from others is welcome.
---
Nerds on a Space Plane. Oh wait 🤔...
---
Eve isn’t a “grab a drink, cheeze its, and candy! Its time to grind all night” kind of game. Its a game centered around pvp. Yes you need to grind and mine to pvp but not at the level and safety to where everyone and their mom has capitals full of skill injectors. Last death in eve has been 202 days. That’s gameplay is for WoW and shouldn’t be transmitted to eve.
---
Exactly! This subreddit is full of bullshit which helps the game dieing.
---
200 accounts?  Simplistic statistics don't really work here.  Goons are spread out over Delve, Fountain, Querious and Period Basis.  And all over the galaxy in other places too.
---
You do know that every time one bot is banned, another immediatly take his place, right ?
---
That's the whole isssue with botting, banning account doesn't really work, you need a massive banwave due to an update to your detection method, to deter people to restart another bot account.
---
Truth is, even that doesn't work for long.
---
Special thanks KUOKUO ,good information
---
They injected the deadly poison in 2016/17 already, now trying in Panic to find a vaccine ...
---
Anyone that predicted blackout was bad was downvoted to oblivion during the first two weeks. It's less fierce now, but they will tell you that's because it's implemented and they leave people to their crying game.
---
But when are these lasts blackout fans gonna at least realise blackout is maybe helping them, but not the game ?
---
You were spotted moving through 39P just before then. If he locked you up before your ship disappeared it is working as intended. Your problem is you were loitering in Delve. That makes you food one way or another if you go afk. Do not afk in delve. We are usually scanning for Marshy alts.
---
&gt;randomly and with no warning drop game changing patches on players
---
You must have never met Icefrog
---
... pot, kettle, color black anyone?
---
Luckily, dealing with bots is not the goal of these changes.
---
It's making nullsec risky that is the goal.
---
we need to bring this back I miss it XD Hauling was so much more fun when i was losing my isk as i earned it, gave me a reason to haul more, now I just have to much isk.... no I will not send you my isk.
---
sp00ky
---
There is no vaccine.        
---
Truth is that they can save the game by putting work into it and not by playing 1/0 "expansions" in the database.              
---
I stated this multiple times.       
---
EVE is big enough to host multiple game play styles.       
---
Like ... imagine yourself if few null regions in eve could be perma cyno jammed, disallowing even gating capitals or building them in such area.        
---
Regional effects, constellation level effects.        
---
All types of gameplay could be included and viable.         
---
Yet after getting almost 1bil in RL cash from us over the years all what we get from CCP is "CHAOS" with someone sitting at work station and playing with bit switches.          
---
Like WTF&gt;
---
Whats the mittani's rim taste like yonis?
---
Yes, it successfully killed nullsec outside of Delve and it makes subcap ratting a pain in the ass, even in Delve.     
---
It's just that this doesn't fix any of the problems with nullsec. Bots have adapted and newbies get the short straw.
---
How funny considering this subreddit is now dominated by the vocal elitepvping minority of the game.

But it's a review of the subreddit
---
You don't need *constant* iterations, you need *planned* iterations. Change for the sake of change, without direction, is just as likely to make things worse. - Not all iterations lead to a *better* system.
---
Welcome to the club my dudes,
---
Good job Pandas &lt;3 I only wish prosperity to you and your allies

Bait with Van next time
---
If he safe logged the ship should vanish when the client closes
---
Imagine trying to defend TEST against blobbing
---
EOH was great, shame it got culled with all the RMT trash
---
I’m surprised Test didn’t post this in one of their unbiased war updates.
---
I mean... flair checks out
---
Haha, I was recording it at night and this is the first time Im recording with mic....
---
Goonswarm we can teach/help new players, we are the largest alliance in the game, and we have experts on everything from shooting rocks to shooting titans.
---
Good. 2005 or thereabouts was probably the last time nullsec was mildly interesting and not a boring circlejerk of a couple bloated mega-groups. Maybe there's a correlation there? :P /s
---
Sarcasm aside, maybe it's better to have a healthier game ecosystem with less players that are more active, rather than multiboxing alt-farms and afk ping-warriors who only undock to drop capitals on ships so small they can't catch, just to deny fights.
---
The game not only survived just fine with 10-15k peak players during those years, but it also made enough money to fund development of the majority of current features and have profits leftover, paving the way for the 60k PCU counts everyone seems to miss.
---
The elephant in the room nobody in the "changes are bad" camp wants to acknowledge is that no matter what CCP does, you'll never see 60k PCU again until there is a reason for people in the sidelines to come fight you and create new rivalries, stories and conflicts. Because most of these players, new and old/returning (myself included) don't really give a fuck about being in a sov holding group, ever since the established groups and CCP have made null gradually safer and too boring over the years. It's just not worth the hassle playing and dealing with you guys in the long term.
---
It's much more fun to do something else for isk, then daytrip into null and farm some linemembers solo, in a small gang or even in a 100-ship roaming NPSI kitchen sink fleet until your ship blows up, than have to deal with nullsec in its current state full time.
---
In other words, if CCP doesn't change things around a little bit to inconvenience you and make it worthwhile for someone to challenge you, you guys will all be left playing by yourselves in your little corner of the map eventually, because you made yourselves too safe, too rich and too big over the years.
---
Plus, the majority of players live in empire space anyway and as long as they keep paying and playing, the game will probably make enough money to stay afloat even if the null blocs start bleeding members left and right. This is not necessarily bad either, because it will be like a "soft reset", making room for newer players and groups to try things out and maybe make their first steps into null, without having to align with any of the pre-existing entities.
---
E.g, a 400-player alliance today can't do much on its own, but in a hypothetical EvE where entities like Goonswarm, PH, Test, etc have shrunk down to a couple thousand members and their older bittervets have stopped playing (effectively sapping leadership, experience pool and the amount of capital pilots available), that same 400-player alliance could strike out on its own, cause some trouble and generate some content. Currently it's not worth the effort though.
---
So, TL;DR, either CCP makes it harder for you and gives the rest a reason to fight you, the content bringing in absent players in the process and raising the PCU, or they don't change anything and nobody bothers with you anymore in any meaningful sense. Looks like you're screwed either way.
---
You know people used to abuse that by hitting alt+F4 to save their supers from a gank, then CCP patched it so that you could keep the hull in space by locking it and tackling it so that it could not e-warp out. This mechanic has been in place for years. Purple Helmet Warriors from PL caught literally dozens of supers this way.
---
The way I see it this guy just got careless or complacent with ship probes in scan range and didn't realize his number was up.
---
Or a 20 kilo ferrous slug, that was fired by "eyeballing it"
---
Ohhh Noo!! All the null-sec crabs who contributed nothing to the game other than an inflated economy are leaving! How will we have massive 1% ti-di fights now?
---
Baited on a free titan?

Isn't that a spider?

/s or retarded?
---
Caught a hel in tribute today,  Yesterday it was mostly people mining in delve in some suprisingly expensive mining barges.  Before that was a larger fight with a loki fleet.  We've gotten plenty of fights just shooting at someone's jump bridge until they form.  We mostly fly nano so if they bring too much (multiple supers/battleships+significant ewar) we just move on.
---
Frt had more in their staging than test's fleet as they droped dreads  
---
I am shocked, so shocked
---
I hope someone got video of the drop and DDs.

That's not what a frig hole says.

What speed RAM do you have with the 2200g?
---
I hope it'll give them a morale boost to fight test sometime
---
It just happened and Vily, who writes those updates, is still in Iceland on the CSM summit. But grrr test so whatever.
---
imagine being this much of a salty retard
---
Christ what are the retards going to do to fuck WH over then ?
---
good bot
---
a few guys in comms were saying they recorded it all, hopefully videos go up
---
But is it only getting refilled ?
---
It is a start in solving a major issue: that of risk.
---
&gt; newbies get the short straw.
---
Nullsec isn't for newbies. Using them as scapegoats in this doesn't bolster your argument.
---
More can be done, definitely aspects that add risk in a manner that mitigates the super umbrella (to a degree. A coordinated group should have an advantage but not be totally insurmountable). The Cyno changes partially address this. Another could be resource limitations. This would affect densely populated space but not really effect relatively smaller groups. This would encourage sprawl.
---
Then after that, there could be increases to aspects of nullsec money making to give back some reward for braving the harsh new spaces to make it worthwhile.
---
But for a LONG time it has been WAY too profitable and WAY too easy.
---
Constantly planned iterations. Sure whatever.
---
Ignores really the point, but sure, clarification and all.
---
Every instance can be unique.
---
Bullying a bully doesn't make you not a bully.
---
And it still took them losing many titans before they realized they could use their own stupidity against the enemy.
---
I dont know what the people that left during the first drop did. Did they leave the game or just started doing something else? Might be Rorq pilots that stopped mining, remember seeing a lot of Rorqs being sold back then.
---
This isnt fair, TAPI isnt outnumber the enemy 3:1
---
Is ZKill in local or Eve time? If Eve time, that was from last night, not 6 hours ago.
---
'valued allies'
---
wait what, tutorials give sp? where do i start ?:)
---
You are so right lol. Have a upvote ;)
---
Oh I think most blame atleast the vocal majority on this sub that keeps shittalking and propping up bad decision making on CCPs behalf.
---
So, theres a lot you can do to improve your combat site runs:
---
1) if you're going to take a mobile tractor unit, drop it when you land. 
---
2a) those arch gisti are elite frigates. They will target your drones. You should recall your drones and save them
---
2b) Angel's are weak to explosive damage. Using  warrior 1s will net you better damage. 
---
3) Angel's deal mainly explosive damage with a little kinetic. That EM resistance amp isnt doing you any good and youd get better tank using explosive/kinetic hardeners than the 2x Invulnerability fields. 
---
4) How are you capping out running two Invulnerability fields? Train some cap skills?
---
5) Bring multiple ammo types. Waiting for the enemies to fly into uranium(?) range when you could be firing lead or iron rounds is wasted time. 
---
6) turrets have two factors to hitting: range and tracking. Any targets &lt; optimal range will have no hit penalties due to range. At range + falloff you have a 50% chance to hit due to range. Tracking is based on how fast your turret can keep sights on a moving target. Closer and faster enemies are harder to hit. That frigate that got within 10km of you was speed tanking you under the guns: your guns couldn't track. Need to fly away from the smaller ships and lower transversal velocity. 
---
Optional) Caldari rail guns are kinetic/thermal damage locked. Consider going to Caldari space to fight guristas which are weak to kinetic/thermal instead of Angel's who are weak to explosive (which a Moa cannot do). 
---
Anyone else have some tips?
---
Quality over Quantity :D
---
Even a broken clock is right twice a day
---
Its quite funny actually. It seems some have finally started to understand that shit is failing so instead of resorting to "its just bots" theyve started with "uhh you guys are toxic with your reasoning and the reason why the game is losing subscribers". And conveniently forgetting that this sub belongs to them and its been fking full on toxic for almost 2 months now thanks to their BS.
---
How would u recommend farming for PVP? I love pvping but it seems the act of doing it isnt very sustainable lol
---
&gt; If you can't find people to PvP in Black Rise I really don't know what to tell you
---
I DO find fights. That doesn't mean I can't want to find more.
---
Are you sure he would write a battle report about it and post it here? If he did though, I'm sure we'd get some guff about it not being a big deal, deflection, minimisation, etc. You know, not for propaganda, just for a good read isn't it?
---
Could always use the official game forum. Oh yeah CCP killed that off long ago with ISD.
---
I don't think anyone at TEST expected that gravy train to last forever.
---
Have u got a fit for this clean up duty job?
---
But I'M the main!
---
It's only necessary to defend territory in war, if it is of strategic importance. If you take a muddy, water-logged field and plant a flag in it, is it really a victory?
---
Oh i never knew safe logging didn't safely log you out I thought it logged you out.
---
I don't know if it's blackout. But CCP sold off the future of the game for a short term bump. Now all the people that used injectors have injected all they wanted, experienced all that came with. Now the game is a giant yawnfest for a lot of people who injected what would have taken years to skill up to the old way. Got a big payout quickly, nothing for the future.
---
Are the not meant to use the best ship for the job
---
I don't think you know what safe logging is.
---
If you add the ability for it to track purchases and sales of items in a kind of "Warehouse" view that would be amazing, even more so if you could then "manufacture" and have the consumed items value into the final product, and then track the transactions for the sale to see profit/loss.
---
Ingame dudes are fine from my experience, some salt chips excluded.
---
On reddit? We a bunch of toxic weirdos.
---
I guess this would be relevant if we hadn't killed all the ones before? It only took FRT to lose more than 3 titans out of sheer retardation to realise they can actually undock and do something about it. But grr test am i right fam?
---
Did this site solo
---
Sure, they definitely can.
---
But this is like the equivalent of an AAR where one dude bosons a destroyer on a gate.
---
Like the whole situation was one of "We've been totally incompetent so long, that we'll let the enemy think we too are incompetant again, and then drop literally everything on them. cause we're so great."
---
Because it's not. The solution is buy plex to sell then you can keep losing ships.
---
If you don't have a job or money is tight then your shit out of luck, and asking here is a mistake because its full of idiots who don't care about you or your struggle they just want you stuff and die.
---
But yeah your deff not the only one so many people just leaving the game now because of this shit.
---
The EVE community has some of the best people. This includes the best toxic assholes.
---
I call bullshit before proven the other way. People lie on the Internet all the time, "before they even materialize" anyone? Submit a ticket and let CCP judge.
---
Well ive got some cash, but would rather not spend it on plex since the conversion is so low. I would probably rather use it to keep my account subbed.
---
Im not leaving lol im actually quite new. Its just hard lol
---
Or maybe it just is you too soft?
---
Recently, CCP refused to reimburse a ship I lost because the ship didn't warp away automatically after I got disconnected. I would not hope for much.
---
&gt; Nullsec isn't for newbies. Using them as scapegoats in this doesn't bolster your argument.
---
That's your opinion. Every space is for newbies, if they decide they want to be there. I was a newbie in nullsec in 2003. Why would this be no longer a valid path? It's a sandbox after all.
---
because reddit posters have control over game design.
---
Every community has its winners and its weiners. Unfortunatly, the weiners speak up louder than the winners
---
Eve's community I find is really good. There are some people who create corporate atmospheres where people can get away with being a cunt but it's on you to find the right corp in that instance.   
---
Reddit sucks I think relative to the forums because it's super quick and easy to make an account. The dregs can create an account in seconds to whine or badmouth the community/game with little to no effort at all. Posts that are productive and positive in nature take time and some investment in part of the author, hence I would argue that Reddit is dominated by vitriol, simply due to the ease of access and the low time investment necessary to shitpost.
---
&gt;Ships that fit covert cloaks use covert cynos, that's the whole thing.
---
Blops can use covert cynos but can't fit cov ops cloak.
---
Astero/Stratios can use cov ops cloak but can't fit covert cyno.
---
It's hardly as clear cut as you imply.
---
But I'm being pedantic and I agree JFs shouldn't be able to jump to cov cynos.
---
imagine thinking like this. I feel sorry for your waifu anime body pillow.
---
Well, i LOVE it. however the mobile device heat up to a point that charging shuts down. I had a few laphdd swapping from fridge as cooler, after just a few small patches the phone was keept cooler and stable. with each update new "info cards" and or items comes in to game. There are Crusers, no ammo needed, game is simple to operate (after learningcurve). alot of features are ofc not enebled yet, and im having fun anyway.I test Playing from an SGalaxy S8 and are very impressed how much they actually inkluded in a Phone game. Thx EVE. :) Anyone Testing on newer devices? input??
---
Don't say that... Whenever someone mentions the possibility of new pirate hulls, I get all hopeful inside T.T
---
frat was bound to win one engagement.
---
&gt; Why would this be no longer a valid path? It's a sandbox after all.
---
Sure, it can be.
---
But saying "It'll be hard for newbies" isn't an argument.
---
It's not a space designed for them. Designing it for them defeats the purpose of the space entirely.
---
I agree with this, in game peoples toons are tied to anything they say so if they are toxic as fuck people can hunt them.
---
On here it's more anon, so they can bullshit lie and be as toxic as fuck without any repercussions. 
---
We should lock flairs behind an auth so if some one claims to he in gona, or test, or a wormhole btw they should prove it.
---
imagine falling for the obvious flairbait
---
It has happen to me twice to die after safelog in 3 years (yes i safelog a lot). 
---
It s not a pb of timer because you cant safelog with timer.
---
Just submit a ticket and you will have your ship back in less than 3 days. It has always work for me, so it should work for you too.
---
I know right?
---
All you need to do is lose a Ragnarok and a Vanquisher to convince your enemy that titans warping to that Astrahus is business as usual.
---
Now what is the next thing that will happen: More TEST dreadfleets being bated, FRT being baited on a TEST dreadfleet and losing supers to TEST supers?
---
I think that Astrahus has more stories waiting to happen.
---
You're right, frat should have countered with dreads.
---
Im sorry but I dont really get this. Today is not the same as 10-15 years ago. Those devs are gone and you somehow think the devs that are currently creating the issues are the ones that are gonna save it? That doesnt make sense.
---
We didnt create the current setup, CCP did. They wanted titans online so they gave us the Rorq against our wishes. It kickstarted a meta that is still ongoing after 3 years and thousands of negative posts about it by now. Fyi, this hasnt been fixed yet, if anything the Rorq has became the best ship around cause ratting went to shit.
---
A 400 player alliance havent been able to do anything for a long long time. You are pretending blocs didnt exist a couple of years ago. And the very reason why these alliances are fading away is simply because they are being overfarmed so they leave for places with security. You are putting a bit too much blame on one side.
---
And "content", ofc people are gonna love being massively OP in a game, thats what these changes have been about, giving the attackers massive advantages. You think its good for the game to make one side OP but guess what, the PCU is dropping a shitton faster than youre saying its going up. So Im guessing one side doesnt wanna sit there and get raped by something that clearly is unbalanced.
---
And all of this is based on "either accept really bad changes or let the game stagnate". You do get there is a third option in all of this right? Maybe, and Im gonna say something really strange now, just maybe dont fking make stupid changes that people are telling you will backfire and instead focus on changing the things people are saying will work? And by people I dont mean the instant gratification vocal majority of "elites" on this sub.
---
Maybe fix fozziesov, maybe tweak citadels, maybe fix the fucking scaleability on the Rorq after 3 fucking years so we can finally end this arms race thats so utterly shitty, maybe make an expansion that focuses on creating conflict instead of just chopping off pieces of the game thinking shit will magically lead to more players.
---
So Im sorry but no, you are blaming us for CCP not paying attention to the game and when they finally do its in the most shortsighted manor ever that only attracts a small group of the playerbase. The rest, who are more interested in the long term aspect are told to go fk themselves which they are currently doing. And buddy, those are the ones that kept the lights on.
---
imagine chestbeating about killing 3 titans when gotg managed to kill 4 snuff titans.
---
Toxic is not the right word. We have a very strong us vs them devide between players in eve. Us and them certanly dont get along but theres at least some reason and politics behind that.
---
How do you not see the fraternity pings?
---
A PR:s job isn't to make everyone like you, it's to promote the desirable view of the group. Inner hell probably want you to hate them. They just don't want you to think they paid some idiot to remove rigs.
---
Why do you assume its blackout? There has been many other changes that affect other people to. The recon triglavs and the loss of 2 Sansha incursions have really hurt the highsec community as well.
---
That statement is so true it hurts ....
---
Great vid blights! Although if you don't start using hotkeys for xlasb I'm gonna come down to lowsec and call you names in local.
---
Yes

i usually use something like this in lowsec. you can drop the nozzle rig with good navigation skills and still get &lt;2 sec align times. damage control for surviving low effort smartbomb camps. dual web/10mn to disengage in case you get tackled in scramweb range by a single target. probe launcher offline. if you discover something that might be worth checking out that isn´t at a celestial or beacon you can online it and investigate.  downsides are relatively the slow on grid speed and a relatively large signature so you´re not completely safe from tryhard low ping sebo gate camps.
---
I know the spin has some of you guys throwing your hats in cheer about the titan losses, but as far as I understand it's the work of a single lunatic who seems happy enough to throw dollar bills or ISK at the game like it means nothing to him. I wouldn't quite call it a strategic victory.
---
Ah yes, a true classic!
---
There is a visible difference in visual acuity between 60 and 144 or even 200htz.  While we on average can't physically see the difference past 30 frames per second, there is perceptible differences in system response in computers that can output those numbers consistently.  Do you NEED that for eve?  Probably not, but if you're going to get it anyway, there's no reason not to enjoy both clients at full detail and spinning ships in stations at glorious framerates.
---
2 vanquishers btw
---
There are a few of us in BUMS now.
---
Caps don't land in the sun if you kill the cyno....
---
How you can spin killing faction titans..? like wtf lmao?
---
&gt; Do you NEED that for eve? Probably not
---
No, it doesn't even really benefit anything EVE does. It just doesn't convey enough information through time to make this relevant at all.
---
Only one on that Astrahus though
---
When FRT find their nuts and want to super brawl we'll let u kno fam, you'll get the goon ping anyway
---
the team tribalism and gameplay tribalism make it toxic.
---
Eves toxicity is unique.
---
They are toxic towars your character, not you.
---
Alliance X hates the guts of Alliance Y and treat eachother like it, but in an eve meet they treat you as a person, not your character.
---
It's mostly pretty good.
---
There just is a lot of angry unproductive complaining about anything and everyone by certain vocal groups.
---
You mean TestCancerPleaseBlue isn't in TEST?????
---
Like a lot of other communities, there is a huge chunk of players that are helpful, funny and good for the community. And there is another chunk of players that basically it's just the opposite. But as I said, this just happens in all communities.
---
Maybe the ratio, based in my own experiences, it's aprox 80% / 20%
---
They were pretty independent when they were still in Molden Heath.
---
If you live in a muddy, water-logged field and someone kicks you out, did you lose?
---
Lies. I haven't received my SRP yet.
---
apologies:  2 titans, 1 super, 10 carriers, 14 dreads, 3 fax
---
Sad to see them join goons but they've been inactive for awhile so I'm not surprised. I suppose it gives the few active members they have left something to do while taking the burden off leadership to provide content. Its a sad state that most groups now aren't active enough to stand on their own and rather have content spoon fed to them in goons.
---
I'm not so sure... Do this Triglavians land on gates? I've personally never seen them camping gates up til now ..
---
I've left and come back multiple times. Each time I come back I find I play the game differently, and more casually. Absence definitely gives perspective, even if you stay when you come back.
---
The problem is that the Citadel/Lifeblood-Meta drove away nearly 50% of the living playerbase or even more (halved Login counts while at same time people created 150-Acc. SP-Farms or 50-Acc. Rorqual-Farms). The Citadel/Lifeblood-Meta catered the game towards people not even wanting to understand that current Delve for example is a monstrous abominantion of EvEs basic principle of risk vs. reward. It questions everything EVE was built on 13 years long before that. 
---
Now CCP is in the middle between people knowing nothing but hello-kitty-EVE screaming that blackout kills their game and unsub their afk-Farms and old bittervets that quit exactly because of that meta, now subbing back. Question is which side will prevail ?
---
I mean honestly, look at how we have to argue now. We have to beg CCP to stop making stupid changes and reverting the ones theyve already implemented instead of having a discussion with them about the things they actually should change.
---
Its genuinly ridiculous that we currently are in this position, that we cant even hope for CCP to actually make a good change and instead we have to resort to try and stop them from full on nuking the game.
---
No matter how this goes, the goodwill and faith people had towards CCP is more or less gone.
---
But what if it's a goon with a test alt that lives in a wormhole?
---
As already said if you ignore the tribalism &amp; scams, on individual level most eve players are kind, I remember venturing into PvP losing ship to opponent yet afterwards having civilised conversion about said engagement to receive x10 the value of my ship from complete stranger, something I learnt to do myself to new characters, I don't know any other game like this.
---
Same. I haven't played in years (2006 main) but the sub is so funny. I like to add that I quit because of CCP trying to be money grubbers instead of just working on making a good product. They crossed a line with injectors. The politics, memes, and BR's are still entertaining though, so here we are!
---
**Thanks dude learned a lot from all this info**. *I will try to make a better video in future.*  
---
yeah and about the damage types I know about it but I was being lazy to use other ships since they were far from the station i was in.   
---
Here is the Sheet for all the Damage types of NPCs  
---
[https://imgur.com/EXG0Ncq](https://imgur.com/EXG0Ncq)
---
Anyone got video of this? Hot damn.
---
&gt; It's not a space designed for them.
---
Again, your opinion. For years it was said by CCP and players that we should get people out of highsec and in to other areas. Finally, some years ago, Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde and Karmafleet successfully drew players out to nullsec and make it a livable place for anyone. Now it's suddenly no longer supposed to be a place for them.
---
Mining returns multiplicatively based on the number of accounts you use beyond a certain point.  This could mean multi-boxing, or organized mining ops within a corp for many people.
---
Not at all.
---
There's a general vibe of negativity and semi-tongue-in-cheek toxicity on r/eve, but it doesn't manifest in game. Even bittervets like me are helpful and not-shitty when we ocassionally are ingame.
---
They can. They warp between celestials so it's rare but possible.
---
Well, I've just got the one box, so multiboxing is likely not for me.
---
I'm going to go through all of the tutorial paths and see what really hits home. If nothing else, I can idle mine while doing other things for some chump change.
---
I get it
---
EVE community is great, EVE reddit is toxic
---
You know we haven't been blue with goons in months now right?
---
In fact I'm pretty sure some of our members were on a goon titan frag literally in delve only a few days ago.
---
You can also plop down a station and put up a cloning facility of your own anywhere in space.
---
&gt;I thought there are other areas and players as well
---
There used to be, but CCP just took the nerf bat to everything that isn't horde, goon or test space, so you can go play there or wander through the vast emptiness of nullsec and remember better days.
---
You really should have picked up on that.
---
Range is usually 50km from your ship, unless you are in a titan.
---
I'm sure test was dreadbombing for a gudfite.
---
it has so much support that thousands of people are not playing anymore.
---
I think most of this would have gladly forgiven them for finding ways to make more money...  if only the product wasn't neglected and suffering from glaring game play issues for over a decade.  I know being a dev is not nearly as easy as hindsight finger pointing, but people have been basically pointing out the same issues over and over again for years.   Most player solutions are shit, but some were really good, and even a lot of the shit ones were better then most of what CCP implemented in fits and starts.
---
The EVE community displays the best aspects of humans, while at the same time displaying the worst aspects of humans.
---
I’m not sure if your aware of when mittens suggested his goons should harass a person til he kills himself IRL. That happened at a meet up.
---
Correct.
---
Is there anything that doesn't go into But mittens with the wizard hat at fanfest?
---
Yup
---
only after they drop supers but better then nothing i blame OBS dont wanting to start b4 they dropped [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbwc8S0LUZA&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbwc8S0LUZA&amp;feature=youtu.be) FRT probs has a recording someone would of have to
---
&gt; that we should get people out of highsec and in to other areas.
---
Yes, as a funnel.
---
Not simply dump them off there are expect them to be able to do a lot.
---
Even in those groups areas, it isn't particularly hospitable to new players, and tends to make them more heavily dependent on others to make content for them as opposed to being capable of self-direction.
---
&gt; Now it's suddenly no longer supposed to be a place for them.
---
Hardly. The goal was never to push brand new players into nullsec, nor has nullsec ever been designed with super new players in mind.
---
You also kinda forgot to mention how that situation was resolved
---
* SRP'd
---
* Insured
---
* How about the vanq
---
* Outblobbed
---
are u kidding? i'm here just to whine
---
but just for you to know, it's the motorola moto x play, android 7.1.1
---
No, it still has an official forum and it is active.
---
I think CCP changed it recently that you can't warp into the sun any more.
---
Good idea!
---
Yup, ever since CCP made those huge changes to benefit huge nullblocs.
---
For someone who wants to move towards using hot keys do you have any suggestion of keybindings to use?
---
Fair call.
---
Not this thread, the one the devs started about the program you can run.  Goofball.
---
I will gladly share my opinion for the low low price of 1b ISK.
---
For a moment I thought you were talking about Heron with shitty lows...
---
You cannot safe log with combat timers
---
&gt; when are these lasts blackout fans gonna at least realise blackout is maybe helping them, but not the game ?
---
About the time that everyone else realizes that the downward trend started with all these changes that buffed nullsec pwoerblocs again and again and again.
---
Thanks for the drake last night ;)
---
i don't think they will downgrade the app just to run in older OS versions, as i said, i'm here just to whine, isn't this why reddit is used?
---
&gt;  stats show kills are down 
---
This isn't actually the case.
---
the MER showed that lost value in nullsec stayed mostly the same, despite the large drop in ratting income.
---
Lol, I am good with not getting boson'd on a gate tyvm.
---
Also, ratting in delve is down quite a bit too
---
80% helpful?
---
Sure?  And you never know with CCP.  If they applied logic to what they did, we wouldn't have anything to whine about.
---
Don\`t approach missions in EVE as in other games ... but think of them simply as a way to make ISK.
---
When u want to stop doing missions, u simple don\`t request a new one.
---
&gt; Alliance X hates the guts of Alliance Y and treat eachother like it
---
Ah, the good old times, where wars of Eve had true hatred to fuel them. Nowadays there are only friendly paintball matches with gfs on local. Sic transit gloria mundi.
---
Damn thats some good motivation guess I gotta now :) and cheers
---
Seems legit..
---
I am legit.
---
&gt; Using warrior 1s will net you better damage.
---
Unlikely in this case. The Gila recieves a kinetic and thermal damage bonus, AND warriors do way less damage to start with.
---
I don't think we have solid numbers on how great the damage hole is but I'd be surprised if it overcame that.
---
(though maybe it is a moa, in which case, he needs gila)
---
Always having fun when pvping man I just want to shot peeps or have them shoot me. either works :)
---
Toxicism does not only flow from elitism. There are a lot of people, including usually me, who just vomit around without any sign of elitism.
---
Don't forget a spy alt in PH too.
---
&gt; at least they live up to the "yeah I'm an asshole, so what?" mentality
---
Ya no.
---
&gt; farming goons in delve 
---
Sweet sweet child. Let me hit u with reality: you are a PET alliance!
---
That's c1 holes. The teal ones in the dev blog.
---
Remember when the word "toxic" meant something?
---
it rolls over to a bigger number? like 200 or 1000
---
That's better.
---
Not for long
---
From the warp in, you could still align to and burn to that position though.
---
but only if they are on grid when you initiate warp.
---
I'd be ok with 10-15k players... if CCP shrinks New Eden by 50-70%.
---
The game world thst supported 60k just fine is far too big for 15k, and you can't have too much space in a game this centered around conflict.
---
You will encounter neckbeards drinking mountain dew on a daily but there's also plenty of people who can be "toxic" in a role play way.
---
Turns out the game is full of bugs after all these years... what a surprise...

---
‘The game was just fine with 10-15k peak players’
---
Lol...that’s going to be the new chant on Reddit I expect if this trend keep us.  
---
That was a different time.  Look at the up going trend then.  People were actually excited about Eve and where it was going.  That is absolutely not what is going on now.  The data is echoing disengagement from the game.
---
Will see where we get ‘resistance’ to this trend.  Used to be about 30k, but I expect it will be at best 15-20k now....until the next change.
---
Well, as a Rookie i can say that others are very helpful and kind

EVE in game community can be toxic as well. Been on comms with utterly stupid racist fucks; call the fuckers out right away. Lots of homophobics in EVE as well. Hey it sometimes feels like RL.
---
This sounds really interesting and useful, please contact me on Discord: `Ionaru#3801`, so we can discuss the details.

If you are on the ball warp stabs are worse than nano/istabs for a &lt;2 second align, if you are not than warp stabs may save you against some threats.

One major counter to this build as you fit no web is going to be the opponents with AB and Web fitted. Found this out the hard way when getting kited by a AB/Web Cruiser. :(

Botting is a money making scheme. It's a job. The account is a tool.
---
A carpenter doesn't stop building when his hammer breaks. A mechanic doesn't stop fixing. A trucker doesn't stop hauling. Tools are replaced as quickly as possible to avoid lost income.
---
Your holding onto this "bots are gone" narrative beyond reason.
---
Does the fact that it was resolved detract anything from the fact that it happened?
---
Yeah but only 1% of the water coming out of the hose actually gets in the pool, the rest hit the lawn.
---
That's how bad EVE's new player retention is.
---
Depends how you play. If you PVP somebody who doesn't enjoy PVP, be prepared for a torrent of toxic abuse. If I had a nickel for every time a Highsec miner told me he hopes I die of cancer... 
---
It's not all of them. But it's a lot of them.
---
sent friend request.
---
The shadow fixed that maybe. In the past you could make BMs inside the sun.
---
The MER shows that null activity fell a lot more from Jan to Jul than highsec.
---
well, most TESTies said "GG", "Good bait", "Well played"  
---
Your story doesn't pay out, sorry
---
I do:

1-2-3-4-5
---
q-w-e-r-t
---
a-s-d
---
and shift + these keys overheats the module. I do it this way so it visually matches the rows of modules on the screen. I also tend to put modules in the same place, i.e. my microwarpdrive is bound to 1, scram/point to 2, web to 3, cap boosters on q etc
---
This doesn't seem to be a sun bookmark though, I don't think.

Bring back the old giant wardrobe in space B-movie look

Don't worry, buy our recycled AT skins, it'll fix it!

Mostly, it's that Caldari just has more pilots.

Like WAY more pilots.

Depends on how new, and what your resources are like.
---
Do you currently day trip? or extended expeditions?
---
Officer mod only dropped from world ark provide groud as far as I know
---
Let your kid play with samurai swords. What's the worst that could happen?
---
Oh, but they still fuck off every time something drops that could kill them.
---
&gt;No doubt that will be replaced today
---
to be fair youll have a hard time finding any loss that doesn't fit that category nowadays
---
The better ones scrape packets and know everything the client knows, which is quite a lot.
---
Bots aren't going away, people are.
---
Compared to some other mmos I find the eve player base to be reletively friendly and welcoming to new players actually.
---
It's all about finding the right Corp, there are a lot out there willing to mentor new players. Bearing in mind eve is a lot more team based than most other mmos.
---
I think there are some bit personalities and some bit egos in eve though but that's kinda all part of the eve experience. You can really have a lot of fun adding some RP spin to your play style, it's a very immersive game. But of course every game and every aspect of life in general has some a-holes and eve is no exception to that, but I wouldn't say they're any more numerous than average.
---
I think some people come into eve expecting they can solo pve and have everything handed to them on a silver platter like they do in certain other mmos, and when they realise the galaxy isn't a safe place and lose a ship or 2 because of the inevitable pvp they mistake that for 'the player base is toxic'. But they don't understand that pvp is a legitimate respectable profession in eve and the people blowing them up don't have any personal vendetta or toxic attitude towards them, they are just having fun doing what the game encourages them to do. If they were to actually chat to the pirate after they've been blown up and ask for some guidance, they might just find themselves being recruited.
---
So the whole toxic player base thing is a false perception probably perpetuated by people who played the game for 5 minutes, got blown up a few times, had a cry about it and never actually 'played' the game.
---
Good luck!
---
PERFECT analogy for what's happening to CCP and EVE!
---
Its literally the worst community of any game i have ever encountered.
---
Nice logo
---
Ah Gloria Mundi. Rex Mundi's sister wasn't it? I always wondered what happened to her and Barry the Time Traveling Brussel Sprout.

Lold
---
Forever Pirate is a really good old one.
---
You gotta also know, they might insult you as a member of XXX. But personally, most players are usually very nice. Even to enemies.
---
We often buy in and fully commit to the alliances agendas and propaganda, because it's more fun like that. But as gamers, we are often in the same boat. And most know that even fights are better for everyone (there are few exceptional ass\*\*\*). Even a griefing player sometimes pays you the cost of your ship, to make it up a little bit.
---
You are doing the correct thing, just keep it subbed. For isk try out exploration, it pays fairly well and very easy to get into. But making money of PvP is in general hard so you need a "profession". On the plus side most of the fun PvP is in smaller ships so you dont actually need tons of isk.
---
Bucky!!!!!!!
---
No u
---
This is all part of the eve experience in my opinion, the immersion of the game creates a lot of character role playing even without even trying. When we are logged into eve we are living that life and we 'become' that character, and let's be honest, New Eden is a ruthless place full of ruthless characters. It's not toxic in the way that it's personal.
---
Why would you be in a group that allows that on comms at all? Calling someone out does nothing. Not giving them a platform does.
---
makes amazing looking stars and wormholes, cant seem to manage to release racial skin sets that include jfs -_-
---
drat, that one person who did that one thing once had utterly ruined his entire point! the entire community must bear this albatross until the end of days
---
fuck you, fucking retard
---
Probably dual dead space rep, DC, enam, cap booster, dualprop and scram, and then armor rigs. Not hard to hit 400 mil if you bling both props and the scram, and it would allow you to escape from most gankers by just scrambling them and AB’ing out of scram range and then warping.
---
I'VE PLAYED BY THE RULES LONG ENOUGH!

---
You do realize the kill **count** and the kill ISK **value** are not the same thing?
---
Keep waving those PomPoms.
---
The problem is you have to either slow boat between cans, or accept that you will overshoot the can and wait for your ship to circle back. With an astero you just hit approach/keep at range/orbit, cycle mwd once, and hack as soon as you’re in range
---
New pirate drones when?
---
Geckos are 100mil now, would be nice to have an alternative introduced.

Jeezus!

---
shhhhh you just messed up their spin
---
Yep, and people ARE capable of changing. Unless apparently you have a hate boner towards them.
---
Well I live in a c4 wormhole with c2/c5 statics, so pvp isnt cheap here lol. Atm loving covert ops ships since i only just skilled into those. Going to be trying Tactical dessies with the hecate since I'm quite into hunting (The stratios is my next skill up, Ive got a fit just waiting on my skills to make sure it isnt wasted when i fly it).
---
Im guessing running the sites in my next door c2 is fine for isk? something like 50mil per hour or so. Running the c5s are great isk but its risky and requires my corp to be active so it really isnt solo content.
---
Would u think its worth it to go to high risk exploration space like Catch/Stain/Providence just to make a lot more isk quickly? Or would u stick to safer zones?
---
Also is Wormhole exploration consistent? It seems kinda dull and u dont find that many exploration sites lol.
---
I also read a bit about c13 site running in t3 dessies and u can blitz the sites super fast due to the Wolf Rayet effect? What do u think about that?
---
To be fair, some people would prefer a corporate culture with a high standard of accountability. I WANT to be called out if I mess up. I also therefore expect people to perform well in their roles in a fleet.
---
That being said, those corps shouldn't set people up for failure. Taking in a newbie to one of these corps would be a corp failing. 
---
I just don't see the issue with corps being different on these things. I think its a mistake to try and make other people ~~live~~ play as we do. I don't think that makes eve community toxic even if others do.
---
In fact, yes.
---
this comment deserves more points
---
They are, however, outnumbering you pretty heavily on Reddit
---
If you downvote the BR it never happened in the first place
---
True
---
I have never been targeted while safe logging but I am fairly sure that any action taken a ship will safe logging will cancel the timer and remain logged in.
---
I haven't play the game for 1 years (last time I really played was during X47 war and before that was catch war when test moved south) the last few days I consider un-subscribe my 5 eve account I kept sub all that time because I see anything good coming to eve soonTM and prefer invest that money into 5 wow account to do some multiboxing on that dead game..
---
People dont "stay" and keep playing eve because toxicity, scamming, and botting has always been heavy encouraged.  The heavily prevailant scamming and constant griefing no matter what it is you try to do is what drives everybody away.
---
This is true
---
But also: Fuck goons, I hope your drones die in a bombing run.
---
Oh look, someone who thinks they are an expert.
---
Eh, they're ok.
---
“safety” and “broken” is retarded to use as justifications they make no sense and mean nothing
---
People cause damage , people choose not to
---
I approve this fabulous bait tile/post.
---
You died at 2158 Eve time. Or about the time you said you safe logged. The only bug is your inability to tell time.
---
They are positively correlated though.
---
Do you have evidence that the number of kills is meaningfully down with the average kill value meaningfully increasing?
---
i guess the people who kept sucking his dick actually should, yeah.
---
I see this that one side cannot exist without other ... as EVE to exist need to have both sides active.          
---
Yep citadels screwed game extremely - but you will not solve those issues in a way CCP is currently doing it as it simply don't address the issues but create new ones.             
---
Look at this :          
---
* Sov. Linked to ADM -&gt; linked to player activity ... and ignoring the fact how much EVE is bleeding the game, current changes simply killed the activity.           
---
* Citadels -&gt; the bigger one the more expensive ... especially if you want to rig them. If you cannot put up defensive force bigger than attacker you will simply lose the structure. Rigged tatara is like 110bil now? or more?                
---
This is fine ... but NPC stations were hit so much that you need those structures to compete with people having access to structures.           
---
Better join a bigger group !         
---
But that is not all - **You can just spam them, and what is worst** you need to spam them ^(like WTF CCP)                  
---
(assuming your home area) You need to put up industrial backbone that cannot be summed up to a single structure - but you need to have multiple structures, not only to reduce cost a bit ^(rig prices) but also as some structures have roles that cannot be replaced.         
---
Simple T2 production setup (modules and ships) is like 4 structures.    
---
Now add on top of this moon mining **and refinery on each moon you kind of need to mine**         
---
Now on top of this include the most amazing CCP invention - industry index.            
---
The more you build - the higher it gets, well fine sounds logical ... but it is linked per system not a constellation, so if you just jump next door and put up some structures you can save a lot of isk on it.          
---
Now the best part. 
---
You have some structures, you have invested in them but you see that you can do more if you change your raitaru to azbel ... you cannot just install some upgrade, but you need to drop new structure and there is no reason to pull the old one, as the rigs cost more than the hull and you can't recover them.     
---
* Push for alts -&gt; i don't know if you have noticed, but most of the nerfs or changes over the time time could be negated by just adding 1 more alt. Like this happened so many times that you can hardly call it a coincidence, **including the cyno changes**.        
---
There is this CCP Raise? interview on TIS? where he says, that this will be not such issue as "just new alt in recon ..." just to "correct" himself just after it to "friend in recon".              
---
Like seriously how many times people asked CCP "make rorquals hard to multibox ?"       
---
Those things need to be fixed, like Christ CCP you created this issues and only you can solve them but it will not by 1/0 stuff in database.
---
He may be getting downvoted to hell, but he's right. You know what hasn't been iterated on? FW. It's in a horrible state, has been in that state for as long as I've played, and a number of it's mechanics have been made obsolete with no development in sight. It's to the point where people even joke about the devs not knowing it exists anymore.
---
We need more iteration. Flat out. We need changes to shake up the status-quo. Yes, as if one actually needs to state it, it should have planning. We're not stupid, obviously we don't mean constant, un-planned, random change without direction.
---
All stargates to High sec re-direct you to Stain.
---
The automod bot is currently a little broken and not is not updating the OP to show the modified discord link.
---
The correct discord link is: https://discord.gg/tWeMAek or you can use the perma link: animeistrash.org/eve
---
Unsubbing 10 rorq alts biomassing
---
but flex tape will fix it
---
It wasn't a bug, he can't tell time.
---
Seeing as how he died as he was safe logging, he won't be reimbursed. What he thinks was a bug is just him not understanding Eve time.
---
rip
---
Yes, I’m sure mittens will be personally responding to the next b4reps post on reddit. He truly has changed and become the model of caring.  Or Mebbe he is still the same dickhead
---
Title should read "Apparently no one can tell time and see OP is full of shit on timing of loss"
---
Awesome, thank you! Can I use this footage in a news video?
---
Actually invited by me liked this scamming and backstabbing aspect.     
---
Eve was always rough game, but CCP is pushing now to be very annoying one.              
---
I don't say that game mechanics that allow some things are good, for sure stuff that let you abuse some mechanics need to be fixed like the trade window.
---
mind if i take those alts? /s
---
Another possibility to consider is that someone logged in the character without your knowledge.
---
Yep. So incredibly hard to use Flash. Quit whining.
---
It didn't. OP doesn't understand Eve time.
---
It didn't. Look at time of loss on zKill. OP is full of shit on the 6 hours.
---
Outside of debating on what video is worthy or not, I figured I would speak on the dying part of the post. EVE Online certainly is going to face challenging times acquiring and retaining new and old players. MMORPG's in general have been in the decline. 
---
However, EVE Online should be able to survive as a studio on a mere 50,000 players if not a bit less without having to close up shop or have the new owner pull the plug. I say this having worked in the game industry for over 7 years on MMORPG's myself.
---
That being said, EVE Online, at least as far as the industry is concerned, has always operated as a niche game. It really was never meant to compete with World of Warcraft. I'm sure someone high in office would have loved to see 20 million players, but in reality, that was never going to happen.
---
EVE Online made it's success from targeting a low amount of players. It has thrived on tailoring a niche product to that fraction of the overall MMORPG market share. Why on earth would you think low player counts would kill a game that made it's success off low player numbers from day 1?
---
You died at 2158 Eve time. Or about 12 hours before you posted, not 6.
---
My shitty dell xps 15 from 9 years ago runs it fine.
---
Why don’t you send me that 1B isk and I’ll double it for you.
---
It is a Moa, he says at the beginning of the video. So yes warriors would fair better.
---
Which one?
---
Bwahha amazing!!
---
&gt; It just bottomed out at 12,100. Last week it was 1k more at the same time. The week before that it was 2k more. The week before that it was 3k more. 
---
So that means in about 10 weeks EVE will have 0 players left ? Well at least I can go mine like a champ even in blackout knowing nobody will touch me.
---
A test char that lives in a wormhole.. He should try and make a test wormhole corp!
---
Other games.  Maybe even RL if this AIDS continues.
---
Oh look, someone who thinks "safe log" is just logging out while safed
---
Took me so long to learn this.
---
Nullsec is for anybody IF they are willing to play on hard mode like everybody else, not the kind that require hand-holding and demand special treatment.
---
I couldn't hear a damn thing he was saying.
---
I was waiting for the Legion to show up.
---
Is it really disco dancing when you guys have been slowly grinding at it for months
---
I don't like nano stuff.         
---
I know it is fun to play ... but after like 6? years of doing it i prefer to commit now.        
---
Like honestly i have no pleasure ^(or time) in killing miners and ratters any more.    
---
Sure from time to time it is fun, but my hunting days ended when RL took over.              
---
Focusing on hunting big stuff when i have the time.          
---
Also my battleships are docked for a while, while fighting in those is fun ... you cannot do it any more.         
---
Not because of supers or titans but because power creep of new CCP ships.       
---
Like WTF CCP those fucking destroyers can outdps my battleship ... and the tank combined with signature is even more in favor of them.             
---
Some time ago it was my  2 battleships vs a guy in a t3d ... we could not kill each other, even with webs.              
---
He was running drugs + a-type reps i had grappler on him and a point ... none of us could break other ^(as he killed my drones fast enough)           
---
This was simply insane.
---
Ingame I've only met cool people.
---
In this fucking subreddit though..
---
I got the invite, but apparently my phone isn't compatible..
---
Have you tried running incursions with WTM and the like?
---
it can be a pretty good stable isk income., plex your account the way you have been, once thats achieved, do incursions with WTM for a little extra isk (and its nice doing somthing different for a change)
---
with the leftovers either pvp (start cheap) and anything left after that means next months plex.
---
im a titan player, with supers titans dreads, but yet, i have SO MUCH FUN in my 15mil battle heron fit in FW lowsec its unreal.
---
late us/early au ? 12 some odd hours a day?
---
The most funny is that CCP will notice this when people start logging in and it will be to late.          
---
It took years to build up current eve population.
---
Same. Will offer multiple exotic dancers if anyone has the apk.
---
sure  go ahead, its my youtube channel so just put evanchristo as source, she'll be right
---
Glad you enjoy the game and that you feel the need to post content.
---
But before you start putting up 'guides' it is probably a better idea to get better at the game. Take the advice from DeadEyeTucker and keep trying o7
---
Hey, you don’t rush the good stuff baby ;). They feeding faction ships over and over why would we rush this??  It’s one build, we’ll just take a few systems and a few more buildings before they manage to do that again. 
---
Building dies like 6.30 , we got everything replaced prob by 9.30 they hit at their strongest time against against a poorer time for eu, it is what it is and shows they have to blob with Titans :p to be effective love to see them do it eu prime time
---
Not in the slightest.
---
People these days are thin skinned bitches on the hunt to find something to be offended by
---
That's the thing with blackout and the cyno changes... it makes hunting ratters easier, but makes everything else way worse. And hunting ratters and miners is really boring.
---
Maybe let's focus on how terrible sov gameplay is and encouraging fleet fights...?
---
How much longer til the self-piloting VNI coffers are empty
---
You from Indy??
---
Yeah I don't get this either, after apex was kicked from tmb there really wasn't any good pvpers
---
its' available on APKpure
---
Nahh im from the region
---
It's available on APKpure for download.
---
Thanks man and will do
---
well. i mean, in one way, nullsec getting all this stuff going on, wormholes, blackout etc, maybe its not the place to teach new players unless your a well organised, well funded, well rounded group (think big null blocs like horde or brave)
---
maybe your meant to teach in lowsec, or in a group, inside a nullbloc. then branch out?
---
It's actually not too bad.
---
At least the core gameplay.
---
Information in the menus is hard to manage though (ends of item names being cut off, a meaningful market search, etc).
---
But the graphics look good and the gameplay is very EVE, but simplified a bit. Only up to battlecruisers though.
---
People that say this don't have the foresight to see what splitting up the already-small playerbase would do to this game.
---
No.
---
How do I find a b274 to camp?
---
i was having fun, and pretty glad i got shot at to see if id get one shot or not xD. i had skirmish links going not exactly helping your damage on everyone.
---
ive seen pheonix's one or 2 pop battlecruisers not kept away from your webs, or dudes who think they can tank but then learn. 
---
the other dreads can fit a single cap gun to apply better dps to battleship tanks. not sure the pheonix hull works with this strategy though.
---
CHAOS ERA IS HERE, NEVER LOGOFF
---
No
---
That's true, and why they would never do it. Player base aside though, I still think it would be cool lol.
---
Yes, exactly that.
---
My gf is from the region but she's hardcore Bears
---
And then what? EVE Classic?
---
It would split up the playerbase...whch isn't good.
---
additionally, the major groups would probably be able to more easily take over the whole galaxy without the resistance.
---
So it could be exciting for a short time, but than it would end up even worse than now.
---
A big issue EVE has is that out of game coordination is VERY impactful to the success of a group in game, and the big groups are REALLY good at this part. None of that goes away with a galaxy reset.
---
Is it also possible to inject a message to the local client that would make that cloaked ship appear?  Or is there missing data from TQ that would be needed to pull that off?
---
Thinking about preventing a form of “man in the middle” attack.
---
OP posted 9 hours ago + 6 hours = 15 hours ago from when you posted.... unless my brain is broken that looks vaguely correct
---
I mean if that muddy water log field connects to your strategic backline and all your production... then yea that's a rather important field.
---
Not really. You would still have the same problems you do todaybut now everyone has to start over. It would be a race to see who can build the first tech ii items and then the first capitals and you would have the same problem all over again.
---
Yeahh my wife is a bears fan.Makes for a good time lmfao Anytime she tries to talk shit i bring up Superbowl 41 and she shuts up pretty quick lmfao
---
Try doing DEDs while killing local crabs in the middle of nowhere. I find it very fun and it's surprisingly profitable, dedicated pve t3c alt in second window helps a lot but solo tengu/loki is fine.
---
Might be on the agenda for the CHAOS AGE
---
It's surprisingly hard to find a decent-sized PVP group that doesn't allow it.
---
Eve has some of the brightest, most passionate players I've ever encountered.  
---
That said, there is a very vocal (minority IMHO) that enjoy nothing more than to be contrarian and toxic.  
---
CCP could do 100% of everything right and they would still twist it into a negative.
---
Eventually yes, but it's that race that would be the fun part.
---
No. A new server would be filled with powergaming from the get go now that all the content has been mapped out. Pioneering was one of the great driving forces in eve whether it's coming up with a new niche doctrine, fit or such... or identifying valuable commodities and resources to control and farm. I don't think anyone would find it interesting; if eve was to create a new server, it'd have to be an entirely new galaxy and, arguably, an entirely new content path of different technologies to explore. It would also have to be constructed in such a way that it takes the already established large groups into account.
---
I.E: In the past, a developer mapped out the minimum time for content to progress so that the time it would take you to undock, warp to an asteroid, mine and back again meant they knew how long it would take for the first battleships, titans and such to appear in the game. Jet can mining was an unexpected emergent game mechanic that they kept in because it stimulated socialization and organisation. 
---
What you would need is a new undiscovered content plan otherwise it's just speedrunning to the highest meta of ships.
---
EVE Online:Classic  .  Never say never.
---
Hahaha I wouldn't go that far!
---
I'll give you two opinions for 1b!
---
my guess would be T3D's above ALL classes.
---
low sigs in prop mode,
---
high DPS (at least on my hecate there is)
---
as far as 'all classes' its completly fit dependant. and starting hull stats dependant. having a low sig is great, but not normally somthing to start your theory crafting from unless you plan to run HALOS and specificly want the 'best dps to sig size ratio' theres no 'in all classes answer to this'
---
Even EvE Vets are still learning, they just have less to learn :)
---
who lives in Providance? and do they shoot on site?
---
Fozzie mentioned the possibility at Toronto, but of course they would be a Cal/Min hybrid... Using armour. 
---
Why does CCP hate shields.
---
On Reddit? Yes. 
---
It's *far* nicer outside of Reddit but then again, what *isn't*?
---
but this is just your skills being applied to the ship on login?
---
It was fun to watch but beens we're always reliable for content. And not the dreks/leshaks kind of content
---
Scam! I bet one of them is fake.
---
With the triglavian recon and invasions and blackout, you get no miners, no prey , no hunters, and no company.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I’m the number one FC in NC., and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Goonwaffe, and I have over 3000 confirmed solo kills. I am trained in electronic warfare and I’m the top Falcon pilot in the entire NC. fleet. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before New Eden, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me in local? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spy alts throughout EVE and your alliance is being infiltrated right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your killboard. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I’m Elite, and my mother says so. Not only is this character extensively trained for all races, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Northern Coalition and I will use it to its full extent kick your miserable ass back to WoW, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

but yet i ran a ghost site in my loki (i was doing my first ever data hacking didnt realise it was a ghost site) died, got full reimbursement. 
---
so, id guess on your thing, something ws not quite right
---
Yes... It's a Stat called "kill count"
---
Re-starting old games / "classic" servers seem to be the rage nowadays (CoH, WoW), but EVE is NOT a themepark game, so there won't be as much nostalgia about seeing old zones or old missions like you have in other games.
---
Because EVE is a sandbox, another server would just be "here's another sand beach, rebuild your castles" (i.e. too much effort, and for what?).  A "classic" server would be "here's a new sand beach, and you can only use old, second-hand toy pails and shovels, go build your sand castles again".  Even more effort for no reason.
---
WoW and the other MMO's have moved away from HTFU, whereas EVE hasn't as much.
---
That said, given their current dev trends and "ideas" ("chaos"?), maybe they will set up a "classic" server, who knows.  May be the only way they see of getting rid of skill injectors, PLEX, capitals and supers, etc.
---
Are we not going to talk about the Nyx?
---
We aren't going to talk about the Nyx, are we?
---
Well I jumped into a TEST wormhole with a bigass battleship collapsed the hole behind me and instead of tracking me down and killing me they offered to let me run free through the only other wormhole in the system (even they had every right to kill me because I was in a juicy exploration ship). But I guess they decided to spare me because of my relative newness to the game.
---
missile application on frigs proberly took him a while to kill ya
---
You explore in battleships?
---
No, NPC Null stations are not the common place for industrialists and you cant do nyx and titans for the sov requeriment. NPC citadels same.
---
Myself use NPC Null in fountain but make a bunch of carriers and prcurers and they take very low space instead the minerals . By the way, i sometimes make Procurers in lowsec and null because use FEW space that the minerals.
---
Or no one would play it because they wasted year working for what they had
---
Don't suppose you have a link?
---
Apparently this guy didn't know that  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78794501/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78794501/)   
---
And yes, there are ways to counter the boson. Warping at pings, for example
---
Is this not what you wanted when you started spitting citadels everywhere you looked, and dropping super blobs on three guys in Moas?
---
No it fucking isn't.
---
I don't think they need to hunt for it very hard. Most of the time it falls into their lap.
---
Ohh... Well, I would need to level up my minmatar skills :(
---
Did he said what faction would they belong? What weapon type?
---
Armor isn't so bad.
---
I don't feel shields are so neglected, I mean Mordus Legion, Sansha Nation, Gurista pirates.. all are shield focused, are they not? O.o
---
SEVEN THOUSAND
---
I don't think an 'Eve Classic' with the original mechanics and original limited content would be very good. Eve has come too far to go back like that. I was just thinking keep all the new shit they've added but just force the players to start again from scratch. Maybe make it a server without injectors and plex would be nice, I'm definitely not a fan of there being an avenue to trade real money for isk or skill training.
---
Yeah, but you would have to do it over and over again to keep the race feeling.
---
We still have a race on TQ, all we need is some things for the guys running ahead to stumble over and maybe one or two shortcuts for others to catch up.

One of the iron riders guys was with us but the other wasn't so I split them because of that pod haha

---
My bad I'm in class and I'm speed typing on my phone lol
---
I would play a new eve. I have a super and multiple toons (unsubbed because the game is trash right now), but I could absolutely see me being drawn into a new world... maybe it's because I don't like the current iteration though.
---
EVE is one of the last bastions of people who think of themselves as really hardcore gamers. We're talking just complete gamergater, 'ironic' nazi with an ironic swastika tattoo, pepe-spamming douchebags. You know the kind. 
---
They do tend to poison the well for many people by and large. There aren't that many of them as far as actual portion of the population, but they are still prevalent, which makes many people's stay in any large corp offputting in the long run. Basically you settle in, people seem cool, then you realize that a couple of them or nazis or whatever flavour of human waste they want to call themselves this year. And the cycle repeats.
---
Most alliances and large corps don't have leadership that is willing to deal with them and make a stand against them, because remember, while not the majority of the population, they are still a big enough portion that it can adversely impact your numbers and resources. Not anymore, since EVE has become a post-scarcity environment as far as large blocs are concerned, but the inertia of just ignoring these people and hoping they aren't *too* loud is still there.
---
So in short, yeah, EVE community is generally very toxic and hostile towards women and minorities.
---
If you take EVE in terms of the sort of toxicity you get in League, the worst I've seen in-game or in voice comms is either groups of people hypocritically yelling in local about fleet comps and the Undock button, Mighty Beans, or a few really overly self-righteous FCs who were like "Everything except \[X\] is trash and you're trash for asking that question". However none of those things are people who pick Teemo so in-game everything's surprisingly peachy.
---
However in EVE you also get people who live purely to stab you in the back (scams, awoxing, CODE) and while those people are horrible people it's not toxicity in the same way.
---
Reddit and the forums however are wretched hives of scum and villainy where allllllll of the hostility and crying come out. This is where Rito Pls becomes ironic CCPls. (Although ironically, not as much of the 'Everything except \[X\] is trash' elitism.) Double-ironically, this is also where you're most likely to have friendly conversations with newer players about how to not die... so it's like, the most polarized toxic and antitoxic environment to operate in.
---
Lmao imagine "null security" space being dangerous for once
---
Some kind of 'semi apocalyptic event' out in null to shake things up and slow the bigger more well established alliances down would be nice lol.
---
....yeah...and where are your numbers for it?
---
Like you had a solid path of logic and a reasonable response, then you undermined it in the same breath.

Well, not the original mechanics, but maybe what they had "leading up to the peaks", so 2009, 2012.  There's a [list of expansions here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansions_of_Eve_Online), you can see when the sov. mechanics were changed, etc., and basically they may pick the version where the mechanics were the most popular with the playerbase.
---
But you have encountered them.
---
I wouldn't call it toxic. More...bitter. Rust...now that's a toxic community.
---
"Is the eve community toxic?"
---
Yes but we are toxic together God damn it
---
Could be a good idea. I don't know much about how sov works these days. I've only just came back after about 4 years break.

some ingame dudes are really toxic as fuck. example is one guy (many many years ago for this specific example, but these types of players still roam today) who can't figure out why people don't join his fleets anymore and his numbers just dwindled over time. He never got that calling people stupid or morons for doing action x with out saying the why, losing his cool over the smallest of shit, smearing another player because they made a mistake (in this case newbro used a wrong bomb type, the he told anybody and everybody that person was the worst at everything, that player was a newer player who had quit soon after others started to echo the smears), always thought his fits was the correct fit disregarding anybodies else's, and proceeded to claim other fits he liked as his own original ideas, and so much more, was toxic as fuck. I'm sure in his mind he was trying to help, thought he was in the right, but all he did was drove people away.
---
He used to get over 100 people in his fleets, but by the time he left, he was lucky to get even 10 people.
---
Very sad to see this go.  Having an easy dashboard I could check from a computer has been really handy, especially when I lose track of which characters are trained into DSTs or whatever.  I'm not looking forward to switching to a mobile phone for this type of data, but the world has moved on it seems.
---
Thanks for SkillQ and all your other community projects.  o7

you are literally the saltiest little child i had the displeasure of coming across on the internet. Holy mother of god, sucking that tiny china dick got you soooooo mad O_o
---
Of all the games, mmo or otherwise online like league, eve seemed to be among the better ones.  
---
Sure, you get the occasional salty or outright verbally abusive shithead, but at least from my personal experience, it didnt happen terribly often.  
---
If you especially consider that in eve, when you pvp, you lose your ship, people are way more chill than in games where you dont lose anything except maybe a few minutes of your time.  
---
Shouldve listened to comms in guild wars 2 world vs world sometimes, that crap was extremely hostile and you literally lose nothing and win nothing from that gamemode.
---
yea same - we hold the general belief that it's bad luck to kill signal cartel, and you will fall out of favor with Bob if you do.
---
One time I was on a fleet and there were a bunch of hostile kikis. I saw Grath Telkin and yelled over FC "Oh shit, Kikimora of Grath Telkin is primary, target is broadcasted!" and no one gave me any shit for it.

In a straight gay alliance my Apostles are named "sexual healing" or "Marvin Gay"

Is this really something that affects gameplay or are you just another troll?

So ... they removed jump mass limit and wormhole mass limit?

Can we enter with few hundred titans and shoot stuff?

Not wormholer btw.
---
'Toxic' is a buzzword. EVE has people in it just like any community anywhere, even outside of video games.
---
Reddit tends to lean left, so it's no surprise that it's toxic.
---
Tessa went and join back up with Origin
---
Nano stuff is fun but takes A LOT more player skill. Can't just hit orbit 500m and getting scrammed in wrong spot might kill your whole fleet. And finding players who actually know how to pvp is hard nowdays.

It's not limited by region.

They opened it up last Friday to every region.

that's copypasta, just to clarify.

So no change really.

Can you provide an actual argument
---
&gt;EVE community is generally very toxic and hostile towards women and minorities
---
Do you have any examples?
---
Those elitepvp dudes were the ones who created bulk of the content into the game. Without them this game would be about sitting on a belt and farming ore.
---
I can't believe blackout is still going. This is so fucking amazing.
---
Why am I getting pinged in  imperium channels to upvote this  thread?

Isn't that what brigading is?

Drones are good too! Eventually if you want to get into capitals you’ll be using fighters, which need the drone skills to operate. If you go into mining they will be your primary defense. 
---
For skills, focus on engineering and an armor (i am a shield nerd myself), and one weapon type and go to town.

how to get the code?
---
lol goons lol
---
PVP'ers are totally fine building their own ships and we don't need plexes to pay for our stuff. Sorry.
---
I the toxicity is in how that all plays out. I’m not an experienced combat pilot. I think with the way combat works in Eve I could be good at it but I’ve been a rock chewer/indy guy for the most part. If I get called on a fleet op on my combat toon, everyone already knows that he’s just been sitting in station skilling up. He may be in a good ship but I don’t know how y’all fly or even the best practice for PvP. If I screw up, tell me what to do to help correct the issue now. Then let’s talk about it later so I can sharpen my skills. Don’t drag me through the shit and tell me to delete my toon because I didn’t perform like an elite pilot doing something I never do. Expect me to perform well and coach me on how to be better. You won’t be able to shame me into being a better pilot, you’ll just have one less target for your enemies on your next sortie.
---
Not necessary... They just need to fix the game they already have... People will return in droves once the core is overhauled and fixed

&gt;There are numerous activities that raise your security standing.
---
&gt;Running missions against pirate factions (you gain security status from the high bounty rats).
---
&gt;Killing high bounty belt rats, a.k.a. belt ratting, in low and null security space (the larger the rat, the higher the increase).
---
&gt;Running Incursions (requires that you have at least aggressed the Sansha rats).
---

If we don't have those players then PVP players will earn more isk from building and mining their own resources. Optimal situation would be that everyone would contribute to the content creation and not just pvp players.

welcome to /r/eve
---
I like the idea of the New Eden passing through some time warp or something and all the systems being scrambled.
---
The problem with 'fixing' a game like eve, is one man's fix is another man's problem. No matter what they do with the game, a good portion of people will end up disagreeing with it. At least they have continued to release new content regularly. A complete overhaul would require a lot of developer resources and time to complete, at the expense of regular new content. Then they might release a full overhaul after investing all that development time in it and people probably still won't be happy. 
---
I think their major mistake was introducing the plex system and f2p, it drove a lot of players away, but they can never go back on it because since then having a f2p/plex system has probably been keeping the game afloat and returning enough cash to CCP to continue developing new content.
---
Hardly the same thing.

Frat pings like horde

My device also not compatible. Huawei Mate 20 Lite. Will try the apkpure link.

If its not RMT then it is using a credit card to help yourself look really stupid.
---
WH sites often have rats. It can be frustrating when your 10th site in a row is rat infested. Some people try to kite the rats away from the site, but that will just draw attention to you from anyone in the WH system.
---
Null is the place to get the best loot. I usually dive through random WHs until I find a null exit. It's not the best method, but completely avoids gate camps. I also get back to hi-sec same way.
---
Once in null you can check the site type (Rats column) using this page: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/region
---
You ideally want the Sanshas regions for best loot. The Drones are the worst.
---
I have got good loot before in low sec systems near to null. Having local makes exploring pretty much fool proof so you don't have to spam d-scan and constantly check the overview mid-hack. Could be ideal for a new explorer.
---
I don't think having Warp Core Stabilizers is really that useful. Align time is what you need to get away. Most people hunting explorers can insta-pop a frigate and have overpowered Warp Core Scramblers so you need to get away before they even lock you.
---
it's as of right now no longer correct.
---
Nope
---
Judging from the killmail it looks like he loaded rage HAMs so it should probably take around 6 hours to kill you.
---
Also protip OP use navy 400 charges in your cap booster.
---
It's exploring. You do actually have to go out and explore if you want to make isk. Nullsec and t1-3 wormholes have pirate data and relic sites with no enemies that you can hack. But you have to be willing to take a risk.     
---
When you first enter a wormhole, first BOOKMARK YOUR EXIT!!! immediately, them look up the class it is on Google (c4-6 are not for solo explorers as you need to defeat enemies to get to the loot cans). If it's c1-3 bounce around and make a safe spot or 2 if you can't cloak. Always have dscan window open and hit it often. Scan down Sig's. You can get lucky and pull hundreds of millions from a single wh.    
---
Same goes for null especially with the blackout. Try to make safe spots far from other stuff so you don't show on enemy dscan. If your Omega it only takes a few hours to skill into a prototype cloak and you can scan in complete safety from a safe spot and no one will know your there.     
---
If you really don't want to take any risks there's plenty of stuff to do in high sec (complexes, missions, trade).      
---
Join a small player Corp. They will help you get your bearings and you'll have fun group stuff to do and make friends. My Corp, we clear wormholes, do incursions, small gang roam, group mission chaining, mining (which I don't do since mining puts me to sleep), group mission chaining, etc. Everything in eve is more fun with a group of buddies bullshitting on voice comms.
---
That's insane. My phone only has 16GB of built-in storage and 6GB of that is available. But I've got a 32GB sdcard in there. Is there a way to put the resource data on the flash card?

I try to do missions for agents linked to trade hubs which will reduce your taxes when buying/selling in the hub.

Stop using this stupid fucking buzzword.
---
Why this dumb idea come up again and again and again? 
---
If you are bored in the current EVE universe, why do you think you would be happy with the new one after a week / month? 
---
EVE is one of the most time consuming game. Why do you think, that people who sank years into this game would run to start from zero?
---
Why do you think that CCP who is lack of developers / game designers right now, would have resources for a second server?
---
you need a code to login?
---
Bah! I don't have an activation code yet :(
---
It does. Apparently 99.99% of the time.

Ththe point is mainly that it only worked well because they have been so stupid so long.

I would say Eve's community is extremely passionate.  This leads to excellent highs and Marianas Trench level lows.  So yes, but not always and not necessarily even often.
---
Instead of making 8 comments saying the same thing with limited info, make it one comment that actually lays out your accusation.

Holy fuck you are stupid. He gave the timeframe in the OP. He posted around 1000 Eve time that his ship died 6 hours prior. His ship died at 2200, or 12 hours prior, which coincides with when he says he logged off.

make eve-online with procedurally generated  worlds,ships...give  all players only shuttle with fitted combat probes,they will have to find  starting ship  then use the starting ship to climb up  ladder untill  you achieve something... players would be searching for ships in group since   procedural generation they would get random t1 frig/dessie/cruiser/battlecruiser..  on scanner you would only see  "mysterious ship" "unknown entity" and when you warp in after succeful scan you will know what you found... the ships would have random t1/t2 or faction fits,since procedural generation you could hit jackpot  or dig your grave.  you could always   pick the   free ship with modules and stock them up and sell/give away as there would be no any trade hubs players would create one and starter 100bil would be eoungh , there would be abandoned citadels/engineer complex/refinery that   would  require  3 hacking sessions. 1 success hack triggers  48h  reinforcement timer.....when it passess you  go for second hack session if you success it you trigger  24hour timer and if you success third time you will be new owner of structure.. structures would be tied to  both players/corporations/alliances so evryone could have their own  but lets say  there would be only 2/2/2 per system to  conquer  once captured their normal  operation is enabled i.e   can be now shooted instead of hacking....
---
now lets  talk about   RNG  titans...no no  no.  we dont need titanogeddon or supergeddon.,.. titans and supercarriers should stay RARE unique ship than now,they should be  rewarded in  LP store,not buildable except faction titans. they could go lp+manufacturing...supercarriers   only manufacturing but things like vendetta only lp store.  NO RORQUALS but  capital mining barges that would  have only 4x more mining power in strip miners than max skilled/implanted exhumer... that cap mining barge could field 15-20 mining drones max skilled 32mining drones....orca/porpoise would be now able to use panic mode but shorter variant   that protect  for 1minute but module wont burn out,it will cool down within 5minutes....and new server should have one more option.. allow players to customize their ships mid-high-low-rig-subsystem slots  with special  modules that could change ship attributes
---
Amazing the amount of people who will just sit there instead of warping away lol
---
Im starting to feel like we may be blue.
---
Its pretty level on sisi
---
Found the toxic piece of shit.
---
pepeWTF
---
Oh look, someone else that can't tell time. The loss occurred just before 2200 Eve time. Now go back and do your math again.
---
imagine failing at basic math while tryharding this much.
---
i know you´re a KF bottom feeder, but come on man...
---
If during the process of safe logging you are targeted, the safe log fails.
---
There have been several fights over the past weeks where this didn't happen, the last one having been the one in Impass 4 days ago where the attackers stayed till test started headshotting FC's.
---
So you can't do the math either? He died at 2200 Eve time. He posted at around 1000 Eve time that he died 6 hours before, which is false.
---
Awwww I'm so sorry you experienced that. That must have been *awful*.
---
You shouldn't have had to go through that. Other people should change to accommodate your feelings!
---
We should totes get on twitter and "*aMpLiFy*".
---
This sub is only good for the occasional shit post and karma farm. Reddit is more addictive (and cheaper) than EVE gameplay.

I've never had someone attempt to dox me over any other video game, so I might be biased when I say unquestionably. Possibly as bad if not worse than League of Legends.

What happens when CCP inevitably breaks their portal app and doesn't fix it for 5 years?
---
Yes!

“It’s just like the real thing!”

Ooo, ooo, call me an "*iNcEl*" next!
---
All excellent ships, youre going to enjoy them. 
---
I honestly dont know anything of value when it comes to WHs so cant give u advice on that. But lots of places in NS are quite empty, especially since the blackout so its not that high risk. Think you can run sites in interceptors quite well actually and that lowers the risk significantly. Otherwise the cloaky explo ships also work great. Also check dotlan, lots of info on where people are actually doing things and its quite easy to see where people arent.
---
That was a fun fun. My Tristan got out with 27% hull then I managed to scram the osprey before the mjd

Have you seen the rest of this thread?

EDIT: nevermind, you apparently have. I didn't mean to trigger your feels over calling you toxic, dear snowflake.

And what makes you think that people dont already krab to fund pvp? I think you dont know what your talking about in the slightest.

---
Of course there is disengagement, what is supposed to be end-game content has become boring.
---
And that's not only on CCP, it's on the players too. CCP gave players certain tools and nudged them to a certain direction (willingly or not), but it's the players who min-maxed the hell out of it to make the supposedly "wild west" part of the game safer than the newbie starting regions.
---
I'm not saying the downward trend is not a problem. I just honestly believe there is no way out of this without breaking a few eggs and ruffling peoples' feathers along the way. So either they go on, business as usual, until they get the same outcome as the chinese server (all of nullsec belongs to a couple of groups, no conflict, people get bored and leave), or they have to make it harder for established groups, nerf some of your shiny toys and risk losing customers in the short term. They have to risk killing the game short-term, in order not to slowly kill it long-term, it's just that simple.
---
/u/Maria_Tokila

You say the current changes make a certain playstyle OP and it might be true, previous changes made another playstyle OP as well and it was also true (and still is to an extent, e.g. a dreadnought should not be able to kill frigates ffs, bring some subcap escort instead).
---
There's a thing in multiplayer games called cyclical imbalance. Different playstyles should be valid enough that players can use one to counter another, then use another one to counter that and so on.
---
If that is not the case, the developers have to buff and nerf different things in order to make it possible. Ideally, it should be necessary for the players to keep adjusting because it prevents powercreep, too much consolidation and boring, unchanging metas. (more details on the concept here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e31OSVZF77w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e31OSVZF77w) )
---
Watch that video, then take EvE as an example. This concept more or less works in subcapital ships (bigger = more EHP and DPS but less application and less speed, smaller = less EHP and DPS but better application and more speed to choose your engagements). But this ideal cycle of counters stops when you move into capital ships. So, it's clearly broken from a game design perspective and the developers have to create mechanics that players can use to form counters (which we don't really have many, apart from bombers and cloaky stuff).
---
As for your "players who are interested in the long term game" argument, well...that's the way YOU play the game. Good for you, but that doesn't somehow make you superior, nor does it mean CCP should cater to that playstyle exclusively. A lot of us don't play the same way. If the game only caters to one playstyle, it will also lose players. Why do you think most of my original group (including myself) quit the game back in 2006? I came back 12 years later and play casually nowadays, doing different things than i did back then, because the game has become diverse enough that there are different things to do. But if you make a single playstyle better than everything else or (even worse) the only viable playstyle, players like me will leave again. Will you also cry about the PCU then?
---
Ok, we are not that many, but neither are you if you think about it. I mean, let's be honest here, the whole "i'm unsubbing my accounts" blackmail is not really that threatening, because nullsec is like 20% of the playerbase (there was a report a few years ago, straight from CCP's own data) and not all of them will go (a lot are really invested in their history/corp/alliance/etc).
---
The majority of the remaining 80% is hisec ghosts who do mining, industry and missions, they make less profits in exchange for more safety/less risk and can keep going for years, paying CCP's bills. They like their monotonous playstyle just fine, they don't care about what happens in null, they don't care about big fights and making headlines in the gaming press, they don't get bored. They just like building stuff and amassing isk, chilling out with corpies after a day at work doing low-effort, low-profit stuff, and they'll keep playing forever. **They** are the ones that keep the lights on, not the guys who unsub their alt-farms at the slightest chance of a balance pass hitting their favorite toys.
---
So, long story short, i'm not just blaming you or CCP, the blame is on both of you, CCP and big blocs alike. Like i replied to the other guy, the game is fucked up enough that they may have to risk killing it through drastic changes in order to prevent it dying slowly in a few years. If you like the game and want to keep playing, talk to CCP (you do have bloc-voted CSMs, don't you?), propose some **balanced** changes and accept the fact that in order for the game to survive, some of your stuff is going to get nerfed in order not to kill the game through stagnation and boredom. Or keep arguing with a random stranger (me) on reddit, which accomplishes nothing really, lol.
---
P.S. Your points about citadels and Rorq scalability i agree with.
---
Your comment is the only one that mentions women.
---
EDIT: So you don't have any examples, then?
---
I don't think Russians come out of their mother's wombs being elite EVE pvp pilots. They all need to go to Russian elite EVE pvp pilot training program in kindergarten though. We always suspected it existed, but now it's confirmed. The Russians are training more.... Russians.
---
The killmail happened at 2158. OP posted he logged off 12 hours prior to posting at around 1000 Eve. It didn't take 6 hours.
---
I'll put it to you this way. If ccp continues doing what it's been doing for the last month in a half. I.E losing 1-3k players per week. Player counts will be in the triple digits by December 1st.
---
You are the thick one mate... He posted 10 hrs ago... That makes it 5 am'ish Eve... Loss happened at around 2200 eve... This makes it 7 hours (around 6 hours by OP's estimate). He states he logged out 12 hours earlier, thus 5pm eve...
---
He states it was nighttime so im guessing he's AUTZ... HE killed a venture in Delve at 1400 Eve, 8 hours before he died... Thus he logged out between 1600 eve and 1700 eve...
---
Obviously counting isn't your strong point
---
In it's current form, maybe they do.
---
If this was 2014 and Brave Newbies, I think I know who you are referring to. Hope he found something better than working for that company after his internship.
---
Ahaha it was in my spam folder
---
You sound pretty triggered by someone voicing their opinion on shitty racist "jokes." Do you need a safe space?
---
Most def. Goodwill takes a long time to earn.
---
I'll put it to you this way. IF ccp continues doing what it's been doing for the last month in a half. We will come back to play Eve again. This is great stuff. Hoping for more chaos changes to happen.
---
&gt;You have a different opinion than me, you must be TrIgGeReD
---
I mean..... they don't call it Rorquals online for nothing right?
---
Catch and Stain yes, Provi no.  Provi has newer players who are more likely to compete with you for sites.
---
When you're exploring, do a loop of systems and do more than one pass.  Your first pass finds all the useless combat and gas sites.  Your second pass is 98% data/relic sites, since you know all the other sigs.
---
I recommend doing data sites too, at least on your early passes.  Each data site you finish gives a chance for another relic site to spawn on your path.  For the same reason don't cherry pick.  I'd say you don't need a cargo scanner either.
---
No, they are graphics tips, only that.
---
When black out started, I put the axe on 5 new accounts I was spinning up. I also sent an email to ccp asking them to terminate all of the CC payment terms for the other 7 accounts paid in cash. I had two more that were plex. (mind you the week after I did this Falcon came out saying NO ONE was mass cancelling and it was all reddit - that's right where I knew it was smoke and mirrors).    
---
Last week the two plexed accounts dropped off. This week 4 more from CC drop off. I'll probably plex one account for another month to observe, however the last three on CC fall off in November and if things haven't changed markedly for the better - I'll cut it down to the main+titan+fax or just pull the plug entirely.
---
They join goon to not be turbofucked by us, so no they were not pet.
---
the one thing i dont like in it is the aura voice
---
Also no blackout in null on mobile lol
---
was a gud fite, pls keep visiting, dont forget to msg FCs for content brawls.
---
EVE is notorious for toxicity but its the exact opposite. I play a lot of other games and EVE is just about the best of them in this regard.
---
I've always krabbed to fund my pvp. I've just done it in a pvp fitted ship so I can defend myself. 
---
The cruel fact is that PVP players don't need PVE players if you don't contibute to content creation in any way. But PVE players need PVP players to defend them. Without PVP players to defend you, you would be in highsec belt mining ore and dying to code gankers.
---
For goon? Hey, goon has always be noob friendly and mass alliance :) how the hell you can tell that lol!!!
---
Not really.
---
I've met a few shitty people in my time, but mostly people have been cool. And even the shitty people I met seemed pretty cool when we met IRL.
---
I'd imagine the larger the group you play with, the higher the chance of finding a "bad apple".
---
Shitty people tend to stand out, due to a cognitive bias we have towards negative things (we notice negative things more than positive things, it's a survival mechanism). But they're also a minority.
---
I hope you enjoy being one of 500 people in the game for the month it takes before ccp shuts down due to server costs
---
It really doesn't take a lot of skill... that really just comes off as patting oneself on the back saying "I'm a good player".
---
Yeah sadly so many have quit and now it's just these whiners and rorqual bots left.
---
What do you imagine would happen?
---
The big blocs are big because they have robust out-of-game organization. They would bring that organization to the new server and dominate it in the same way they do TQ.
---
You see, most players aren't american and in our cultures what you consider to be a racial slur is nothing special, so it gets used a lot because it makes thin-skinned idiots who don't understand this get very angry, which is entertaining for everyone.
---
&gt;Awwww I'm so sorry you experienced that. That must have been awful.
---
yay caldari union day, still cant buy the caldari laundry day skin tho
---
Yeah if you just anchor up and let some other player fly your ship it might bet bit easier. That is what you are talking about right?
---
I mean, at least they aren't Blades of Grass
---
Posts like this would seem to indicate you are not a part of the quality portion.
---
MORE CHAOS!
---
So his times are off.  What's your point?
---
Also if you want people to listen, try not being an asshole.  Nobody gives a enough of a shit about your point to go do research.
---
What are you accusing him of?
---
This is very good post and should have been in its own thread.
---
I said what I meant. It doesn't need interpretation.
---
Yeah it can be. But BO was really worse for rorqual. Mining in t2 drone with a capital ship is bad!
---
He posted at 5am Eve time mate... Look at the age of the post, compare to evetime and.... Voila... 5am....
---
You're retarded
---
is EVE toxic?  no.
---
but that no is related to gaming culture vs those who aren't familiar with the culture.
---
gaming culture tends to be a bit more lighthearted and friendly, while sounding mean (cause we know people are rarely serious and so like to exaggerate ), this of coarse varies game to game as some games are less competitive or more "friendly(easy to play)"
---
to those outside of that culture (call em normies, or real lifers, or in case of WoW, outsiders), they see how we act an take it at face value. and so they think its toxic (they a bunch of space nazis!.......they dont understand why we think that term is funny)
---
couple that with today's culture of looking for stuff to get offended by.......and yeah.
---
now if you mean toxicity of bitter vets vs EVE's overall culture.  again, no. its not real toxcity.  its a mix of people pulling against nostalgia(call em old guard)  vs those who are satisfied right now, but will become bitter vets given enough time and experience.
---
could also look at competitive/dark souls style/iron man games.   vs forgiving "no loss penalty" games
---
(i answered a similar question on if game stores are sexist. the answer, no. its becoming part of the culture. vs trying to force a foreign EXISTING culture to match you.)
---
Second wave of invites went out today
---
Something, something, touched inappropriately by space Catholic ships
---
well yeah, because it puts us in jump range of their staging
---
Evict Inner Hell now plz thx
---
If you happen to like smallgang pvp this is great. No more blobs.
---
I had this happen once to my Loki. I had safe logged and then died about two hours later because the ship apparently didn’t actually despawn. I petitioned and got my ship + half fittings + implants back.
---
I just happened to play during the time when eve had 60k players peak and the game was brutal back then. You would have pissed your pants and cried to mommy.
---
I mean any game is subject to a certain crowd of dedicated elitists.  Compared to other MMO’s I’ve played I’ve experienced fewer of them in EVE than in games like wow within the last month of playing.
---
Overall its probably the best gaming community around that ive been part of. EVE is interesting compared to other MMOs because really its a game of direct competition so obviously we going to troll the shit out of each other and name call and all that shit that goes into competitive activity.
---
But at the end of the day we seemingly also can pause that and understand that we are all just nerds playing a space sim. Best evidence of this Ive experienced is live events such as meet ups or fanfest type shit where the logos we proudly wear come second to getting pissed drunk and having a good time.
---
No other community compares honestly.
---
Edit:
---
And yes there are some shit people...and you do need to have a bit of thicker skin to appreciate the community compared to shit like WoW or FF14 where everyone just holds hands and sing Kumbaya or w.e.
---
being this fucking dumb...jesus christ
---
Oh good. I'd love to see red alliance become a thing again. I hear insmother is a great place to take this time of year.
---
Oh also can we have 10 minute siege again I do miss that
---
A new BOB ?
---
It does feel like the real eve experience, just abriged. With the daily skill boosts, you can fly a cruiser relatively well in just 3-4 days.
---
Ships have a lot less slots for modules and a lot of things are still missing, but it's interesting.
---
If you like the full eve, you might like this.
---
If you don't like the full eve, you won't like this.
---
I started in 2005 so ok princess. I bet you have been in high sec that entire time.
---
The game was not more hardcore with scorpions with 7 stacked MWD's. The game was safer with assigned fighters and supercarriers poked outside pos shields. You dumb shit gibbon
---
You have to understand that a lot of Americans think it makes them "morally virtuous" to be extremely sensitive and ever-vigilant in regards to any trace of anything that could be construed as racism or sexism. Yes, lots of potential for entertainment.
---
nothing, dudes an idiot who can´t into clocks and basic maff.
---
&gt;almost everyone in eve  
---
Almost everyone in eve doesn't really care enough about them to hate them lol....
---
Got my invite too, this game seems to be more than I was expecting..
---
Guess you are illiterate as well.
---
Yeah looks like I need to take off the rest of the day at work to see what's up with this game :(
---
Im not a botter and im still loving Eve :)
---
Good. This was a problem. The dudes with twelve rorquals made so many people irrelevant.
---
YES! Eve classic with no titan / super and fax.
---
Perhaps those people were and still are irrelevant and they are just angry with that fact?
---
Honestly, not far off. Although I always got the impression that they had functional, non-terrible lives outside of the game.
---
More like they don't sit in a dozen rorquals for hours anymore.
---
Imagine CCP taking a balanced approach.
---
There is more than one way to be terrible, not only rascist jokes. And eve community excells at them all.
---
Pvp players absolutely need pve players. Do you understand how the market works? Or why pandemic legion is now F teir who cant field more than a few kikis for harassment? Without income you dont have srp, without srp you dont have pilots who want to risk anything interesting. So now you have every fleet being in dumb as shit jackdaws or trash bomber cancer fleets.
---
Im not saying things were good before this, in fact lots of shit was broken. But 2 wrongs dont make 1 right. 
---
I get the balance issue. But these changes dont actually fix any of those. What was broken yesterday is still broken today. I dont have a problem with adjustments, I do have a problem with short term thinking when it comes to balance.
---
Sure, you have a point. But for a gamedev long term is key. Its one thing that me and you have different playstyles but for CCP to start doing short term things is..
---
NS holds far more than 20%. Those numbers are from a period before the blocs became what they are now. I would say it easily holds +40% of the gamepop today which is the last number I heard from CCP, no source on it tho. But it makes sense considering how big the coalitions have become in comparison to before. And looking at how the PCU has fallen I would say its even higher than 40%.
---
So the threat isnt as unthreatening as you think. I dont condone that behaviour but Ive only seen a couple of those threats and honestly, people troll way too much so there is no actual way of knowing if people saying those things live in NS. So those should always be disregarded no matter what. But the PCU is dropping like a rock, that cant be ignored or explained away by "only bots".
---
And I dont wanna be that guy but honestly, if all the small gangs would vanish this very instant it wouldnt make much difference. They dont stand for the industry aspect, not the recruitment aspect, not the marketing one, not the majority of PvP. What do they do thats so awesome for the game? I mean honestly. 
---
Small "elite" gangs are basically leeches that live off the work of others just like gankers in HS are. Promoting that playstyle, like CCP has always done even though it most def hurts player retention, is one thing. But going so far as to neuter long term players to give massive advantages to them is really really dumb. And its showing.
---
Now Im not saying we should alienate small gangs, Im saying that if you dont work, you dont eat. Eve is supposed to be hardcore right? You try going into some other country and start killing their citizens willy nilly. How long u reckon before you get crushed? But hardcore in Eve only seems to go one way, easier for small gangs and harder for big gangs. In no other game would any dev even consider this, that people belonging to massive guilds would have issues with smaller ones. 
---
But here, due to CCP employees personal bias its considered as "gamebreaking" if they dont get more advantages. Thats bullshit. If small gangs want content then CCP should make an expansion that allows them to fight other small gangs, not nerf the defense networks that are kept in place by hundreds if not thousands of players costing trillions of isk and countless manhours. That gets rendered useless if 5 guys want to grief (sorry, get content) in your home. Its a joke man.
---
But it wasnt a big issue so fk it, it could have remained. But now its standard practice and people dont want it.
---
Dude, the CSM have presented balanced changes, even on the blackout, its been discussed for years over there. CCP has ignored them just like they ignored them on the implementation of the Rorq. Nobody has an issue with nerfs, NS has been nerfed atleast 5 times this year alone. Where was the ree? Nobody cared which is why most dont even know it happened. You are giving us far more shit than we deserve quite frankly. We are also players and we recognize most issues faster than others since we see them sooner. 
---
But we are being ignored. To the detriment of the game.
---
Since you cannot be tackled while in Bastion, being able to MJD in Bastion seems a bit overpowered.
---
&gt;Sarcasm aside, maybe it's better to have a healthier game ecosystem with less players that are more active
---
The people with a dozen rorquals won't like your post.  The people who did nothing but rat all day won't like your post.  The people who just *can't handle change* aren't gonna like your post.

This is gonna earn you a lot of downvotes.

Frigate roams, guarantee you're not gonna be hot-dropped cause no one has the skills for big ships (yet), having to pick what skills you're training "for effect", map that's rearranged with the empires around the edges and 0.0 in the middle...
---
Right now everyone hoards what they have / "what they worked for", and all the pixel-ISKs are preventing a lot of people from undocking.  Because you paid PLEX for them (either as a subscription or as actual PLEX), so they're not pixels to you.  And because of that, no "content" is worth the loss (undocking).
---
WoW gold, nobody gives a crap about it.  Yeah it's harder right now getting the silvers I need for a decent staff, yeah it'll be tough trying to put together the 100g I'll need for the horse... The chance to lose my billions ISK in EVE?  No fucking way, I'm unsubbing and keeping it, until the game "gets good" (never).
---
Yes, and then the eve client stays open. His client closed, so that didn't happen.
---
Oh ye most def. I have never seen this many Rorqs being sold (lots of firesales).
---
So that is what you meant.

Nobody wants carebears who just cry when the game isn’t FarmVille-in-space anyways, you guys are cancer to the development of this game and it’s community

People always say this like adapt or die is something players are forced to do.

In reality, players choose the third option, which is to just unsub.
---
I agree with your premise, but TEST is pretty good about it.
---
Obviously losing Vily or PGL today would be a huge blow, but the fact that we mentioned both of them is something on its own.  And lately they haven't been very active.  We would survive.
---
Losing DurrHurrDurr has hurt a ton, imo. 
---
TEST could lose any particular one or two people and recover.
---
Why do you cloak ingame and not here on reddit?  Go hide
---
Or perhaps some sort of doomsday event in High and Low sec and make all of those players move to null?
---
Reddit posters? Yes. Actual players? No.

I challenge your "several" statement and await your references to "several" engagements.

that’ll decrease the dinoposting for a few hours

Jump Gate icons.  I think I thought that the jump gate icons were set to the corp icon of whoever is sovereign in the destination system.  Not true?  Who sets these, are they automatic, etc?
---
That's the die part.
---
Or you know, maybe the changes people are saying are driving them away from the game might be it? Even if a lot of people are choosing wow classic over Eve, it wouldnt have happened if people were happy right? I mean you can always present ten million different reasons why people stop playing but in the end its just 1 thing, people found enjoyment elsewhere.
---
Thats literally how you lose players.
---
The in game community is generally pretty pleasant, but r/eve is where the salty bittervets rage against the game.  Flee from this subreddit while you still can.
---
Your interpretation is incorrect, but I think you knew that and are trying to make yourself feel better about being an elite player. Good for you. I encourage your desire to have self worth.

Alternative explanation:

someone else logged you in?

You have played since 2005 and still haven't learned anything? Bravo!

I still don't understand why CCP redesigned the hangars and didn't make them large enough to see the whole ship. Same for the supercap hangars.
---
So you want your little cloacky ship to be put in safe when you're not playing? Do you also want them to provide you easy kills? Just adapt or die
---
If you say so of course! Can you tell us some words of wisdom about virtual spaceships please.

As long as you have injectors and Plex it's a dead issue .

I don't know what you've been doing with t2 covops to get that experience but I've never overshot a can in any of the covops by approaching.
---
Will I have access to my hangar through Diablo Immortal??
---
Not a biased viewpoint at all
---
Looks like we found the care bear who wants change but is too afraid to undock and do anything to promote change
---
iOS doesn’t have picture in picture so you can’t even watch YouTubes to pass the time.
---
I don't have to listen to you.
---
that's a good one. 
---
hey guys come over here we found the comedian.
---
most of the content come from warring factions, territorial disputes, resource aquisition, etc. etc. I'm not going to spend much time elaborating b/c you're either trolling like you don't know this or just suffering from a stroke.
---
Just get rid of highsec? :p
---
nah, it's an important part in the natural order of things
---
No, it would be shit.
---
When can i get titans??
---
I always look for a corporation with new players with below 2 years playing experience for a more entertaining corporation.
---
So your evidence of botting is... what? People mining in Ventures and getting their Iterons ganked?
---
Botters paradise is a go once again.
---
The spin: that killing his faction titans means anything strategically, when he quite clearly is able to grab a new one.
---
&gt;The Centipede Caliphate is a small alliance with fun pilots.
---
Everyone who isn't pvping with tengus is a bot for these people
---
You didn't know? At least 99.09% of all active players in EVE are bots. It is known
---
Better they're doing unprofitable stuff in highsec than making real isk and impacting the game more in null.
---
Blackout made it harder for bots to function. And easier for players to hunt them.
---
Idk, I'm currently popping TCUs as I work (and reddit). GOTG is rolling over and barely contesting either structures or sov. 
---
Anyway, the best reason to fight is because it's fun!
---
Yeah, blackout made all the real players quit, only bots are left now. If anyone knows it's RoboBoy.
---
I wish chaos era would get rid of ur posting
---
Dont you have a phone?
---
Fastest way is to buy PLEX with IRL money and buy tags.
---
Other than that, look at the options in the link and decide which is the best combination of fast and fun for you. Lots of folks forget to have fun with what they're doing.
---
Aren’t augmented basically Rouge drone faction drones? The stuff to build them drops from elite drone rats iirc
---
Compared to other gaming groups? Yes. The things some in this community do to some people and to a lot of the CCP devs is downright abominable.
---
Nice flair bait. You can circle outward from a trade hub and look for wormholes, but you already knew that didn't you?
---
That's great. 
---
Tell the CCP security team, not us.
---
Baited on a free reply
---
How can NC help on this? Undock button must be highlighted
---
Ingame peeps are great for the most part. Join a good corp make some friends and have fun!  
---
r/eve is fucking SHIT tho bruh
---
*TLDR: If you accurately describe yourself for this situation, either you lied to get in or your recruiter didn't do his job.*
---
Right, but if you don't know what you're doing, maybe you don't belong in the corp in question. If you said "I don't know what I'm doing in combat ships" on the recruitment questionnaire, we'd point you to horde or some other corp that does recruit people who do not know what they're doing. Its not that we hate you, its just we don't think it will be a good time for anyone involved. Same for people who don't have our required doctrines or required alts. We don't hate them for it, we just encourage them to apply again when they meet the standards.
---
We're not trying to shame you into being a better pilot. If we call out a corp member, we're admonishing a person who knows better and has demonstrated in the past they know better. We've had people that get in before who don't know what they are doing. We then have a conversation about shaping up or shipping out. I know this because I was on the receiving end of one of these conversations. But choosing to ship out of shaping up doesn't mean we never speak again. We've had people ship out that still hang out and are friends, just in a different corp now. 
---
&gt; you’ll just have one less target for your enemies on your next sortie.
---
Thats a strange way to think of it. I'd be more worried about 1x less dps/logi/whatever. I'm not saying all corps should be like our corp. I am saying that people in my corp like being there, because they like being in a corp where the expectation is a high degree of proficiency and accountability. Our corp MOTD is "DON'T BE SHIT" in giant font (Hi Tyee). No one is hiding what the expectation is or surprised by it.
---
It makes me wonder if they're going to become an actual faction with agents, loyalty points, and all the rest. We've already got the Drone Mind that works for ORE in the Algintal constellation, so it's entirely possible for some of them to coexist peacefully with humans.
---
This also begs the question of what would happen to the people currently inhabiting the Drone Regions, since that's the most obvious place for them to hold their own sovereignty.
---
MWAHAHAHA
---
Good bait is good. Always nice to see content like this!
---
If you're on Android you should have the option to move apps to your sdcard
---
Idk what you do but iOS has picture in picture future, you just need YouTube premium, but I can watch twitch just fine on my iPad
---
Wtf do you have like an iPhone 4?
---
I agree
---
Kinda sad that null sec was safer than high sec for so long. Or else these risk averse groups would've never went to null.
---
 *Incompetent and Proud*  are sending masive invites too, using ESI in some manner I receive in my alts without corp, many invites of them and someone, 1/3 cant be reading in EVEclient, using ESI in fuzzwork to read, but look as strange and probably bots trying to hide with mass invites
---
Buy injectors for only $4.99!
---
Why would you want to play this is my question. If it truly is an abridged version of Eve it sounds like it'd be a little sad...
---
The idea I've heard CCP throw around (Affinity and Falcon mentioned this as well) is it would be The Seven, which is currently a missions-only faction that has very little lore around it (so they can expand it in whatever direction they need).
---
Also Angels are nominally shield tanked as well (though much like Minmatar they're pretty good switch-hitters). For those following along at home, armor tanked options are Blood Raiders, Serpentis, and SoE (Trigs are technically t1, not pirate), so it's a _pretty_ good split, if starting to lean slightly into armor.
---
Ah, the old Navy SEAL copypasta. A beloved shitposting classic.
---
TWO FUCKING DICTORS
---
ARMOR HACS
---
YOU ARE THE CANCER ROTTING THIS ALLIANCE
---
Atleast now they make 1/10 of the isk compared to super ratting
---
Not true I got an rattlesnake reimbursed, just not the modules that dropped
---
My god, the members of XXX are so bad. Members of YYY, our brave and reliable allies, are so much better.
---
Next month: I hate YYY, why can't we unblue those unreliable fuckups and burn their space?
---
The smiley should be indication enough I'm poking fun.
---
It should probably reformed so that botting in it isn't attractive by having more dynamic content, but yeah it's part of the game.
---
I'm sure CCP knows and the security team is working hard on designing Highsec Blackout™
---
Err... It was about time? I used to base just across Phoenix from these guys from last September to March of this year. I might have seen 2, maybe 3 of them in all that time. I do hope they make a comeback(if they were good to begin with, I genuinely don't know them) but this was waaay overdue. Disclaimer: I used to be in Bastion, not anymore, so lower the pitchforks.
---
Well, never give your ideas for free, someone might make tons of money from it. They must fix that alone
---
My Corp is small and we don’t presently have big ambitions that I’m aware of. Most of us are miners anyway, which is why my combat toon might get called to action. I was let in to my Corp because we’re relatively laid back. If I get called to fight, I may not do well. And it’s not because I lied or falsely represented myself. My main is an orca pilot. I guess my point is shaming a miner for not being an elite tier Loki pilot, or for not having 3 different logi BS in dock ready to roll.
---
what the fuck ccp
---
I spent 10 whole minutes coming up with George Costanza puns for ship names. 
---
👈👌
---
If you leave a red Corp for an npc Corp you are still Kill in Sight. You have to join a specifically neutral Corp in order to not get shot, and even then it’ll only protect you from Provibloc, not the other groups living in Provi
---
One of the best copypasta EVER in the 1ntern3tzz
---
Yeah, and we can't even ship spin supers. But they've also updated sun's and wormhole graphics for like a 3rd time now while planets and some ships remain untouched sooo I dunno. :)
---
isn't forcing the bots to mine in FUCKING VENTURES the best outcome reasonably possible?
---
they might make 4 mil a day
---
When I was a starry-eyed newbie in a hi-sec corp, I had a guy who used to buy all my shit, ratting loot, explo loot anything at all at jita sell. I had a dude who took me to wormholes and taught me the ropes of exploration. I died dozens of times while exploring in wormholes. The people who ganked me always were friendly afterward, one due taught me how to d-scan, others just gave advice or donations. One even tipped me 50mil for killing my poor little imicus. I was amazed at how these random people who I've never met before are being so nice to me. 
---
Fast forward a couple of years, having plexed multiple accounts through exploration I still carry on the tradition to train and help out newbean explorers. I also give a nice donation to any newbro that I kill in my exploring runs.
---
Asked this in the last week but did not have a reply figured I would put it in this week as well. Is Blops battleship use complete shit still or with blackout changes has it made a come back? If so what are the new types of set ups people are running? Thanks!
---
It's not safer; the risk/reward ratio is higher. Botters don't care if the bots get killed; they care about maximizing isk/hour
---
Anyone know how to get it on iphone?
---

Nice vid.

Where did you get the fit
---
:)
---
they don't need plex
---
What are the core issues in your POV?
---
If you didn't safe log and just use the normal log off then your timer can be extended by rats targeting you. Some rats will target you from 10000 km away and your ship will forever be stuck in place. 
---
This is just a theory and I'm not 100% sure that it actually happens.
---
I haven’t played in a long time but when I did I found it to be both the most welcoming and also most toxic at the same time. Was sort of this thing “of course we will help new players now fly this thing and set up your UI exactly how we want it. Oh you don’t want to fly that? Well it’s because your poor and a piece of shit new bro, it’s fine I’ll just give you a billion isk you fucking leech. There happy?”
---
from Costanza to Memesis 
---
nice
---
Dude, I don't know how much more blunt I can be about this. I Don't think I want to be in your corp, and I don't think you want to be in mine. This is fine, because we don't all need to be in the same corp. Don't call my friends toxic because we correct each other harshly when we fuck up. I've been saying this the whole time.
---
&gt; some people would prefer a corporate culture with a high standard of accountability.
---
&gt; I just don't see the issue with corps being different on these things. I think its a mistake to try and make other people play as we do. I don't think that makes eve community toxic even if others do.
---
&gt;we'd point you to horde or some other corp that does recruit people who do not know what they're doing.
---
&gt; I'm not saying all corps should be like our corp. I am saying that people in my corp like being there, because they like being in a corp where the expectation is a high degree of proficiency and accountability.
---
It's not toxic to correct people who know better. Its not the right environment for everyone, but that doesn't make it toxic. Conversations about "Maybe this was a bit too harsh, lets talk to ABC about his sabre alt" are fine, but that's not for an outsider tell us about. Have fun doing what you want with the sandbox. I'd just hope you could extend the same courtesy to me and my friends.
---
just imagine the k-space migration size once they figure out that wormholes are safer than all, I already see a few transitioning there
---
Oh wow really? My S/O has android and def doesn’t pay for YouTube and it’s a free option.
---
and guess who often played their parts in those
---
ooof you could preserve steaks a few months with that salt
---
Oh boy. Just checked my email and saw my code as well. FC, wut do?
---
We’re definitely not on the same page here because as I was trying to explain, if MY Corp called ME out on being a shit combat pilot, it’d be a bit fucked since I joined AS A MINER! I have a toon that CAN fly a decent combat ship but that’s not how I play. If your Corp has expectations on pilot skills for entry, then yes YOU should call your pilots out for not doing their jobs.
---
CCP puT blaCkout tO stoP bOTS. Think oF the lItTle GuyS.
---
That the Drekavac creates at Triglavian crusier wreck instead of the Battlecruiser wreck, LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE.

so basically "we didnt want those systems anyway"
---
Wait for real??

be me
---
go bot hunting in 2020
---
get blobbed by concord
---
f.reddit
---
What is eve echoes
---
You still need a key to get in though?
---
So actually we have around 20k people logged on, and these bot pilots are about 8k, maybe not all of them ative atm. Plus the bots remained in FW, and nullsec, we have around 10k real player, or less? A story of great success...
---
Would much rather face fuck you guys then leave. Rather than wait for 30 content pings and a 100 man ferox fleet.
---
I love most the part when they told that they want to step against too big coalitions and stuff, but all they did is forced the most people to join them if they want to survive there.
---
&gt; Tell the CCP security team, not us.
---
If you want CCP to do something about a problem you tell everyone else, not CCP. If it's public it jumps to the front of the queue, if its not public it gets added onto the 'do later after X project we're working on' pile.
---
I saw that was an item in game yesterday when someone posted about it in the noob help chat... apparently they're classified as livestock LOL
---
Capitals aren't the issue,  having 10000 of them is the issue.
---
Care Bear Stare!!! Warm up the heart of this fuddy duddy with our rainbow rays of happiness!

In Fairness to Beans they fought when we connected to them...

And they never ninja rolled away with some lame ass excuse...

It's like Frat and Co. Is finally starting to pull their heads out of their asses and learn from their mistakes
---
Yeh the tentacles are deffo not the best group in wh space but theres a zillion of them and that many gilas effin hurt. Would be a challenge for burning cross.
---
Worst case ontario they can always use armor rattlesnakes
---
Who cares if all the fucker did wad bot or ran many afk alts or covetors. I don't and I have a better experience without them, however adressing balance issues for niche playstyles by wiping them out and softening the game to hopefully retain 99% retarded newbies and turn it into a plexed theme park will not work well in this game as 99% of content creators will leave.
---
Laziness made themselves irrelevant
---
Can u guys share pictures and videos or is that all nda
---
Capitals ARE the issue.
---
Imagine they somehow limit capitals to only 50 in game.  Some sort of process where you can get one, if you "capture" it from the current owner.  What do you think will happen:  will they be end up spread out across the alliances, or will they all accumulate in the hands of ONE alliance?
---
They're like nukes.  50 nukes or 10,000 nukes, world still ends.  Everyone who can build them, desperately builds them.
---
it's almost as if some of them have even been recorded

and then we have this little thing that happened in fountain from earlier on the same day as the impass thing -

and ofc the impass one itself -  [https://zkillboard.com/related/30002605/201909011800/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30002605/201909011800/)     
---
   
---
there was more as i tried to limit it to ones where BB was involved ( with the exception of the second fountain one) but this should fit the bill for "serveral". If only reading zkill wasn't so hard, right?
---
Nah it's actually 19999 bots and you
---
I too can pull numbers out my ass
---
Yeah it would probably help to mention your corp at all, as reading your initial comment in reply to my comment, it appears to be complaining about all corps that criticize members.
---
&gt;I the toxicity is in how that all plays out. I’m not an experienced combat pilot.
---
&gt; You won’t be able to shame me into being a better pilot, you’ll just have one less target for your enemies on your next sortie.
---
It really reads like you're calling my corp toxic.
---
In other news, you need to talk to your corp, as either you or the other guy seems to be in the wrong corp.
---
Or Canada; applied Friday got my invite today!
---
Hell no, r/Eve is much better. On the official forums you have more internet tough guys than in a martial arts forum. Also, many people on official forums seem to have limited knowledge of the game, i.e. they blame Alphas in their Ventures for the mineral inflation. Since you cant downvote these people, so you have to read through tons of bad and wrong posts in every thread.
---
Not really. Maybe yes, for a week or so. It just gave a challenge to the bot programmers, and they have already solved it.
---
'EVE in my pocket': the last fucking thing my wife and kids want to hear.
---
good
---
Best they learn that lesson with something relatively cheap like an inflatable pool than something expensive later. I grew up playing with swords, crossbows, and bb guns, and learned many valuable lessons along the way.
---
I'm not certain about that. OP says he logged off 12 hours prior to the killmail then posted 6 hours after the killmail, which, since the kill is at 22:00 EVE, would put the logoff at 10:00 EVE. Isn't that before downtime? And you say OP killed a Venture 8 hours before dying. OP has to be way, way off about when he logged off.
---
You really think CCP can stop bots in their entirety when games with vastly higher budgets can't stop cheaters?
---
Calling out bots is good. Expecting the bot problem to disappear entirely is insane.
---
Totally agree, and the reason behind this proliferation is injectors.
---
All NDA
---
Underrated comment
---
lel got em
---
Ohhh I think I've blown up one or two of their pleasure hubs while running lv4s! xD
---
Let's just hope they have cool looking and powerful toys to offer in the future...
---
What I think non eve players will hate is how during combat it's still just dots and symbols on a grid. Flying with a close cam on your ship is next to impossible
---
Very nice story risk averse carebear
---
wow I have a family you know
---
no it didn't
---
I hope not. If was true and you logged with enough structure damage, you could be blown up as you logged in.
---
acceptance post #21
---
\&gt;Beans  
---
\&gt;Well-Trained enemy
---
what are you talking about my dude?
---
CCP's counter to that is make WH spawn rates higher. As if bots care how many WHs they roll.
---
is that too much a stretch from the typical screenshot of 10 rorquals in a belt?
---
Every meme we of a Corp should be expected to perform in the capacity they were hired for at the very least. In my case my main was the one hired, the alt brought along as an extra asset if it proved useful. In the end the point of the game is to be successful for yourself after all. If that success is defined by helping win a major combat op, then that’s where your performance should be focused. But if my Corp suddenly decided to go full combat and then decided that was a shit pilot because I didn’t have the skills they wanted, that sounds pretty toxic to me.
---
The Gila doesnt have a kin/thermal damage bonus for drones, only missiles. The Gila's only drone bonuses are for medium drones. It's free to use any drones as long as they're medium.
---
I don't really disagree with this post but I feel like it's context is trying to unravel my narrative here somehow
---
Not sure if I'm allowed to talk about it or not, divulging corp intel, etc.  Might have to ask there first, last time no response.  The TCU and IHUB thing makes sense though.
---
Personally, i am of the interest that the developers should pursue a vision, regardless of immediate or even mid-term losses because the vision produces balance long term. I've seen many many games, two in particular very similar to eve, where the developers knee-jerk in response to the community and both of them have failed drastically.
---
I'd personally wager its because of the extremely stale meta, null politics, citadels and super umbrellas over the blackout changes.
---
P sure this is a troll post.
---
Am a corp mate and was on field when you guys caught his mach. He 100% DC'd sadly :/ GF tho good target discipline. Look forward to shooting you guys in the future o7
---
I saw a guy in my corp use that fit..... To kill you..... Twice....
---
Unless plex cost a large part of their income it's not too important. If a super bot was making like 20b/month, and is now making 2b/month, that's a huge difference in how much RMT isk is going into the economy.
---
Edit: also the lack of political impacts (nullblocs carving out huge regions of space for suspiciously high-paying renters) is good. There'll always be cheaters but now they warp the game a lot less.
---
Got into the alpha today--
---
They could release the game today and it'd be playable/fun.
---
In-fact I hope they expidite and release early.  It's hella fun and it feels like EVE.
---
The controls are annoying, cause its mobile and I hope they can find a way to streamline some things.....It also seems to DESTROY battery life, but whatever..
---
I'm so ready for this.  Are you ready nerds?
---
Hahahaha, Armor hacs is classic!
---
Man thats not even a bad part of town lmao
---
"toxic" in this meaning isn't really a great concept. It's usually used to just discredit persons. If a person behaves bad then there are many words to properly call that out.
---
If you say what things you consider toxic (or you think others might consider toxic) we can go through those step by step :)
---
If you don't know the other two, you should look them up. First is a progod rage, third is a grath rage after losing a revenant.  Both are fantastic.
---
You know that alternating caps is really annoying right
---
Is it even worth installing.
---
bots make a fraction of what the do in highsec as they did in nullsec, like a tenth or less
---
highsec bots are also much easier to detect
---
Honestly that probably won’t change as far as battery life, it’s a 3D online game on phones, most laptops don’t even handle that too well
---
Why would I? I don't know your sexual situation. Calling someone an incel is being a toxic piece of shit just like defending people who spout racist and homophobic comments.
---
How many Rorquals before it's "botting"?
---
Meh
---
it's a little bit of both, bots are moving to highsec, real players (krabs) have quit, and bots are being discontinued.
---
it's all factors, and players who quit because of the removal of local are marginal and unneeded for the greater sandbox
---
bro what are you even talking about you autist
---
I also got it, but the game isn't in play store. Even joining from the download link it says "Element not found"
---
Hi, i hate you &lt;3
---
Basically: in game, all cool. Reddit, trash. The upside is that goes for pretty much every game, at least here we get good stories on occasion.
---
Under a super umbrella.
---
Sure its great if you like don't get time to PC game or travel often. But if your like live at your PC...just play the PC version xD
---
Yeah I've heard all 3. What makes armor hacs memorable for me is that I was in coms for it.
---
The interface is... Well, they did a decent job converting the pc version to mobile, because it's usable but still garbage in the way that only Eve's interface can be
---
They even made the overview familiar enough to not really need a tutorial on how to overview
---
The return of the wild Chuck, season 1, episode 1.
---
WHen you're in a fleet doing something like a citadel bash, why does the FC want a HIC bubble up around the fleet?
---
A valid point that doesn’t suit your narrative is still valid and correct. It has made it harder for bots to operate and easier for them to be caught. If you don’t admit that then you are clearly just upset over blackout and unwilling to discuss facts.
---
&gt;defending people who spout racist and homophobic comments
---
Oh I get it!
---
This is one of those things where if you call the other person a "Nazi/homophobe/whatever" or a "Nazi/homophobe/whatever sympathizer/defender", you get to call them all sorts of names and it's totally justifiable and not toxic.
---
Calm down conservative.
---
Bastion gives immunity to ewar but you can still get scrammed.
---
Looks like shit lmao
---
I think most of the game is turned off for this closed alpha test.  If you love eve give it a try it will all be very familiar.
---
yeah its a low graphics version of eve, my phone didn't run it particularly well either.
---
It's an online game.
---
Ah very well I stand corrected
---
Morgan Starlancer?
---
You defended groups that allow the remarks, even lying and saying good luck finding even a medium sized group that cracks down on it. 
---
Try that racist or homophobic shit on my comms and find yourself bounced from the largest Alliance in the game.
---
It prevents anyone warping directly into you.
---
Top is destination, bottom is current.
---
Maybe there's a problem with your narrative?
---
Kill a battleship in a system then go to the next system and do the same.
---
You get credit for the highest kill in a 15 minute window per system.
---
Tags only go to 0, not above.
---
Truth - otherwise the graphics are surprisingly good. 
---
The hardest part is I am going to want to play it on a larger screen hahaha.
---
Thank you!  Will be sending out some WarDecs to the scumbags in Metropolis.
---
That is MY region.
---
Where did you get an idea like that?
---
You get reimbursed if your loss was due to either a bug or another player abusing an exploit.
---
You're still stuck with the lossmail even if they used an exploit to get it, but at least you get your ship back.
---
Only Darwinism.
---
And reddit.
---
Indeed it is a sad state of affairs.
---
Inb4 "it's just bots leaving".
---
you guys dont care about bots in highsec you just want free skiff kills.
---
You forgot subscriptions are up, more players are logging in than ever, blackout got rid of the botters, reeee umbrella
---
&gt;Anyone else have some tips?
---
Get a proper overview? Fastest way is visit the ingame chat channel "Z-S Overview" and follow the instructions in the MotD.
---
Use the probe launcher window (alt + p) to find anoms and not the agency. Undock that window from the solar system map of course.
---
Have local open and set CODE to -10. If a red guy appears in local be more careful.
---
I would also have dscan open but in highsec of lower importance.
---
Yes, it is against TOS, so you will be banned if they find out. If you're willing to risk that if, then go ahead.
---
Read the EULA?
---
he was being facetious
---
its like buying the supermarket brand of cola vs the real thing :)
---
Spinning the Spinmaster 9000 in reverse is considered an exploit by some.
---
How could they find out? You making huge ISK transfers to accounts that already have a large amount? Would that set off alarms for them?
---
If you suddenly are giving out large quantities of isk, it looks kinda sus
---
No problem, you can sell as much isk to your heart's content!
---
Don't be mean to the cloaked cowards. 
---
They're already emotionally unstable
---
EVE's gameplay revolves around fucking other people over for asspats from zkill.
---
What kind of people do you EXPECT to play such a game?
---
I have done. I'm not trying to figure out if it's against ToS I'm trying to figure out if you could get away with it
---
It’s pretty good.
---
Very true
---
The corp I'm in has the accountability, if I fuck up (and I have) I'll be told I fucked up and what I should do next time to avoid fucking up. It's always in a positive way ("aww fuck, how did you even miss that tackle? I said tackle commit and you're literally our only tackle, so you should commit! Next time you should just go in a grab something when I say you should commit" (I thought some of our battleships on that roam would have fitted warp disruptors or scrams, they hadn't)
---
i mean they added those razbag trigs which are annoying and can kill afk people.
---
I'm autistic and I don't really understand your metaphor. Do you mean commenters are excessively detail-oriented and annoying? If so, then I get it. 100%.
---
&gt; but wormholes don't have bots right?! RIGHT?!
---
And here wormholers thought they wouldn't be ass-blasted by CCP anymore before the new year, lets bring wormhole blue income down to 10% drops. It's okay, its ruining the game to kill bots, it's unfair they get to *never* affect you or make a dent in the economy. Furthermore it appears bots love burner missions, lets bring production and income in line with the rest of the game. Still so many gameplay types to ruin before EVE is free of the bot menace and its playerbase.
---
Nice Tags !
---
no just on r/Eve
---
I prefer to work for cash rather than isk.
---
And one or two rorquals and a combat ship sounds like a lot more fun than a dozen rorquals.
---
Ask the many that are constantly being banned for it.
---
Apparently my Galaxy A50 (basically has all the specs of a flagship) is not compatible. Makes no sense.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Is this mainly aimed at stopping an interdictor from bubbling your fleet?

This has to be a troll or bait. Just... I just fractured my tail bone slipping off of the smooth brain.

Ever been evicted from high sec? Ever been told you can't because I make the rules? Hug that bear tightly.
---
Thanks fam
---
Unironically uses the term 'gamergater,' sees 'nazis' every which way they look, becomes defensive when asked for examples...now where have I seen this before?
---
No, it's actually better. An example from our neighborhood: GOTG's GWU bots can no longer rat and keep ADMs up from 24 hour a day forsaken rally point spinning, and GOTG is in the process of losing Fade as a result. That's a tangible political result in null of the bots moving to HS.
---
I'm a new player still in hs myself haven't had any1 try to kick me out yet
---
Great picture, keep it coming!
---
Before blackout you are fucking dumb if you lose a cap while ratting. Except awox.
---
Yeah everybody should be risk averse when you you play to print isk. You are here to make money to finance your playstyle not to lose money.
---
If you need to use a cap for pvp; you dont use your pve cap.
---
I see nothing wrong with Black Out for the entire game. 👍🏻
---
whose your in game character.  i'll ping it to CCP so they can give you an answer.
---
lol. dude when you register you accept NDA. and you post screenshots with nickname? 10iq gaming
---
You'll get banned eventually, that's guaranteed but considering how long it takes for CCP to ban, you'd probably get away with it for a couple of months then they would take the ISK away and ban  you along with the buyer(s)
---
Not to be confused with the Dick 101 class, facilitated by CODE. and PIRAT
---
Honest question why do nullsec alliance sabre fits already default to T1 cloak + guns rather than using gunless T2 in fleet fits. The T2 fit massively improves survivability and your ability to actually tackle stuff.
---
This is what I personally find to be the better fit https://i.imgur.com/HXUjArU.png
---
Also it's 3 large smartbombs (not 4 large smartbombs) to clear bubbles.
---
&gt;  like a tenth or less
---
A Ratting VNI makes like 40 an hour with Alpha skills. Even venture mining is well above 5 mil/hour.
---
If you're a new player, it's the best community i've come across.

They could restore Orcas to their pre-buff EHP that'd already help a little. The way Orcas are now is just disgusting and they might as well be immune to PvP :(

Shoot a bot in highsec and you get concordokken'd.

If you’re gonna go, go balls deep.

No is not as my experience they are hostiles against the enemys and  friendly with blues and people new to the game
---
Oh sorry. Can't know who everyone is.
---
If you have to ask stuff like this in a public forum YOU probably can´t tbh
---
sounds great just  send an app to one of the big wh entities like hakws we love rmt, isk selling scum lords destroying the game.
---
I dont think its particularly toxic, at least no more toxic than any other game, probably better than most. Eve is extremely competitive and when people compete they talk loads of shit. I'm fine with this.
---
Jealous. I want it available for the razer!
---
They did a very good job. It feels a lot more like EVE than I expected.
---
There's no portrait creation option, is there? Or did I miss it?
---
Now, if this could be connected to TQ so I don't have to start all over again, that would be amazing.
---
One worry: my phone gets pretty hot from running it (OnePlus 6, 8GB ram, Android 9). Is everyone's?
---
instead of a local blackout it's a Concord blackout
---
In eve the key is becoming a desirable target, such as wearing a specific tag or having something considered valuable. In highsec the only value most aggressive entities seem to find is the TTT keepstar and market pvp tradehubs which compete with the keepstar in caldari highsec.
---
It would appear the targets by and large are instead high value single targets such as transport vehicles, abyss runners and people who want to fly 500m+ hulls with potential bling.
---
Always!
---
[**OFC!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W7c8QghPxk) its one of the thing ccp early goes after.

---
So you say the astra is still isk positive?
---
&gt;You really think
---
No, he doesn't. It's big brain bill
---
Noted
---
Wormholes aren't exactly bottable though, even if someone were to write a script to run the site they'd still need to babysit their setup and find sites to run.
---
Essentially what would happen is that people from previous coalitions and alliances would just reseed and flood as fast as they could.

T2 extenders and T2 guns with a T1 cloak is cheaper, and it can shoot back. Some cap FC once explained to me that Sabres are basically ammo in big nullsec fights; they’re made to die. T2 guns and ammo can get you away from one or two frigates that might be trying to chase you. If things come down to the difference between T1 and T2 cloaks or the few thousand EHP from faction extenders, the 50 HACs that null blobs always bring erase it. 
---
Your fit looks better for camping wormholes and small-gang stuff. The ‘null fit’ is just optimized for nullsec economics and fleet dynamics.

just wait till you see a guy w/ "HLDGATE"

I herd something about being able to run the smaller highsec invasion sites solo or duo with marauders tanking, is this true? Are there any groups that do it?
---
now CODE. can finally do their thing, right?
---
That's not the point.
---
The APK can be installed regardless of their approved list, because that list only affects the play store listing.
---
Managed to go 78 jumps to my home system in Nullsec.
---
&gt; If things come down to the difference between T1 and T2 cloaks or the few thousand EHP from faction extenders, the 50 HACs that null blobs always bring erase it. 
---
The difference between the T1 and T2 cloak is absolutely huge and I've had people absolutely amazed at the fact that my sabre can actually tackle stuff. T2 means you can crash gate so much more reliably. As for the extenders, just T2 them and it should still fit, this is just the default fit I go to.
---
Also if two frigates attempt to chase a sabre of any sort you should be able to just leave lol
---
You put a what if scenario in, then based your "proof" that capitals are bad off that. Capitals have obvious weaknesses, but people wont engage them, or alliances will drop thousands of them. That is their issue.

You seemed to have forgotten the path of this conversation, let me refresh your memory:

Not only do these references fail to support anything you claim, the #4 reference supports the complete opposite argument you are trying to make. Notice the stuka fleets fucks off after they nuke a couple rorquals and the muninn response sets up to defend.

Maybe this expectation makes you the piece of shit.

Move somewhere else Provi won’t be safe when the cyno changes hit.
---
In app or at the install?
---
I would guess it's processor architecture.
---
But anyway, I've never heard of an app having. Hard coded device compatibility, so it's definitely your phone rejecting it, and not it rejecting your phone.
---
sure
---
Blops use is very fun if you do things right.  Bait is harder to dis concern, but your hunters have an easier time to set up.  Blackout is a big win for Blops.  That said, I think Blops will ALWAYS be a niche gameplay....maybe halo type gameplay for subcaps.
---
Fittings can be found if you look at Blops losses on zkillboard.com

lolllllllllllllllllll
---
The Space Hobos are a strong small skilled alliance.
---
We've gone from bots injecting isk into the economy, generating tax revenue for alliances and propping up ADMs to bots injecting some minerals and data site loot into the market in high sec. Seems ok.
---
Go to lowsec and kill battleship rats.  I think every 15 minutes your sec status will go up.
---
Way to completely dance around the entire arguement he made lol.
---
or the fact Fade is a shit region and no one wants to put in any effort to maintain it
---
And the last thing they *will* hear.
---
i can fly a venture wanna team up?
---
Yeah, it's a what-if scenario, so it's somewhat pointless to argue.  I just don't think CCP can implement an effective system where the concept of capitals can be separated from the number of capitals.  
---
In all other MMO's out there, everyone wants the "end game" gear, whatever form that may take.  If capitals are allowed, they will proliferate.   I don't think it's possible to separate "capitals" from the issue of having 10000 of them.
---
As far as "that's their issue", blame whatever alliance you want for "destroying EVE", it's not their game.  Every player can attempt to shit up a game, and it's valid gameplay.  CCP makes it possible to bot, they bot.  CCP makes it possible to scam, they scam.  CCP makes it possible to blob and blue donut, they fucking do.  
---
It's not their issue.
---
The internet facilitates toxic behavior. MMORPGs, social media, forums etc, are just the conduit through which the toxicity flows.
---
They went on strike
---
Don't even try to get people like this to see logic and sense, simply laugh and make some fun out of them then move on.
---
what narrative am I trying to push here?
---
Press F1.
---
You're conversing with the biggest whiner on reddit about the changes so don't expect much.
---
...ok, but memes is what?
---
Is that EVA ?
---
IDK didn't snuff just have a Titan fight the other day on deployment?
---
At least when I fuck my waifu body pillow it doesn't tell me no or call me a bitch and laugh at my small cock.
---
Yea there some interesting files.  
---
There have always been some files in the game for planetary space elevators.  It seems one was just updated recently.
---
If you get webbed, you die.  If you get scrammed, you die.   Being able to drive off light tackle is important in null sec.  Other than the small shit coming for you without fear.  
---
I have used them to kill small drag bubbles too.  I even go over it in the talk, though it's quite long.
---
corax buff anytime now
---
I’ve never had an issue crashing gate with the cheaper cloak, and one pulse for the MWD/Cloak trick gets you out of a bubble that’s on a gate at 0. 
---
I guess it comes down to what you want to pay for or what your alliance wants to SRP.
---
the majority of bots don't operate on local or shit people typically utilize, they read data produced by the game logs - the VNI nerf did much more damage to nullsec botting than a blackout did. All they do now is n+1 venture, iteron, and heron alpha alts
---
I have a hard time believing someone made a burner mission bot when i can barely do them :D
---
Hide goon propoganda. Ignore goon sock puppet posts.do not reply to goon posters
---
Yes, but *bots* didn't care about that and happily ratted it up, dumping money into GOTG's coffers. They were unable to do that any longer. It's a great thing that the larger group footprint has shrunk, since the bots don't allow it to artificially inflate ADMs and falsely create safe "empire" space.
---
Do people insure Titans and  Carriers? It's not like they expect to ever lose them
---
I was told I’m fine as long as I keep a Cyno Generator in my high slots. I have a Networking Sensory Yay so I can quickly kill any ships that might try to tackle me anyways. 
---
I’ve ratted in G-5 for weeks like this with no issues, I don’t see why I should move now. Maybe you’re just salty your VNI got nerfed and you can’t afford a carrier
---
you're literally talking out of your ass
---
all the do is add 9 alpha accounts, and no, highsec is almost as profitable as nullsec at this point
---
mlyp
---
CO REP YEEEEE BOI, nice tags
---
Sure but there is an issue here. Other games are not complex. Even the hardest games out there are rather easy and completely possible for a developer to understand. Eve is not, it requires tons of hours played and you actually have to test different things. Is it any wonder you think that the only thing that Eve devs are not allowed to do, be a part of NS in any real sense, is the one thing that keeps getting shat on? And the things that the CEO and for instance Falcon like are the things getting buffed?
---
So ye I agree, in other games. But Eve is not like other games. The lack of knowledge from the devs are rather apparent. And its a fine sentiment but let me ask you, if you wanna fix things according to a long term plan why would Hilmar say all of this started a couple of months earlier than the BO? That hardly strikes me as long term planning. And also, why would you begin with the worst parts of a long term change without making sure the rest is in place? If good changes were implemented first maybe nobody would have left?
---
Rather their current actions are knee-jerks in response to the community and thats why the game is rapidly failing atm, not the other way around. They thought they should please what is only a vocal minority.
---
I wont say it doesnt have anything to do with that but if you seriously believe that x gets changed and then we see y, the reaction, and that it most likely has to do with z and not x then I dunno what to say. The first weekend after the BO we saw a massive drop that got masked by login events starting only a couple of days after which upped the number and lasted until Wow classic got released. 
---
And then the numbers tanked again. Now sure, you can say its wow classic but Occams razor. The easy explanation is simply that the change was disliked which is proven by data (dotlan before and during BO in regards to activity and the initial drop) and that the login event did exactly what it was supposed to do, amp up logins. Then came the cyno change and people started losing hope all together and without masking it the numbers just started diving.
---
And heres why I agree to an extent on the last part. Shit is broken, people have been pissed about it for a while. But these changes only solidify that CCP has no clue what theyre doing and people just lost hope of the game ever being fixed. I did, I know many others who did.
---
So sure, what you say has merit, but its not applicable to our current situation. Its fairly simple, people that live in NS warned about all the ramifications that are becoming true every day this shit persists. We knew this simply because we know our home and we know when certain things are broken and the effects it will have on us. Ignoring the people a change is gonna hit the hardest is a really bad way of doing business.
---
Its honestly not harder than that.
---
You earned this upvote.
---
If he wanted to have an actual conversation about it, he could have done it without throwing shade in the first half of the sentence. :)
---
no thats an angel
---
a bot sophisticated enough to utilize a super is most likely going to be sophisticated enough to not require local - in summary the blackout barely affected super botting, those are still going
---
waaa
---
So those are gonna be the "Local enabling" structures that CCP is going to announce next Fanfest and that Nullbears are going to claim as the conquest of their "boicot" and reddit's whinning, despite the fact that CCP planned on doing this from the start? 
---
Looks great.

EVE CLASSIC CONFIRMED WE DID IT GAMERS
---
are you an actual dad to who the internet and games are still something of a novelty? because that'd explain the dumb "woah"
---
Eve Online forum posters are toxic.
---
Eve Redditers are toxic.
---
People in game are pretty nice.
---
I agree, code and pirat are so scary. 
---
They are the only reason I don't live in high sec.
---
So.. 200 accounts spread over three time zones is 65 accounts per time zone. Assume 2 accounts per person. So 32 people. Assume each person is a heavy gamer and plays 3-4 nights a week. Let's further assume they play 4 hours instead of just one or two. So that breaks down to 8 people in a system per given four hours. HOLY FUCK THAT'S INSANE!! HOW CAN THEY HANDLE THE DENSITY!!
---
Can't tell if joking but highsec blackout wouldn't do anything. You basically arent going to find a high sec system without neuts in it so the bots arent using local for when to dock like they were in null.
---
&gt; ~~Only~~ *Anyone but* Hilmar may save us 
---
FTFY
---
So true... I haven't played for 7-8 months or so and thinking back now "what the fuck did I waste my time on, this piece of trash!?"
---
More like “yeah, you’re mad that we exist, so what.” xd
---
I was hoping
---
The assumption here is that they cant just make 10 to replace the old one? Thats a very special kind of assumption tbh.
---
\*boycott  
---
also observation structures are dumb and solely for defenders benefit, local for all was a benefit to fights
---
Compared to the effort of summoning another abyssal, more asteroids or more havens whenever you want being forced to roll and judge the safety of holes (plus actually defend whatever hole you're living out of) is a huge leap.
---
Tree Fiddy this has something to do with the technology developed in aether war
---
How are you catching them easier in HS? I mean wtf dude.
---
You are one dumb motherfucker. Go back to faction warfare
---
 This will be like the fifth post-Eve game that CCP's tried to produce.    
---
In other words, yet another reason for CCP to ignore Eve.
---
Wasn't the test basically a flop?
---
Level 4s are infinitely spawnable and one of the easiest things in the game to bot?
---
Exploration is possible but only a few people do it because it's a massive pain to code a good explo bot?
---
There are people who have botted wormholes with barghests or rattles but it really isn't in the same league as mining or ratting bots as it isn't reliable fully afk income.
---
Eve can't possibly be more toxic than LOL, there are not as many people playing it, so LOL has a much bigger chance of having far more toxic people than Eve... the game is shit tho and not worth anyones time though... mr. new_player#54622
---
dying down to dangerous levels?  what did we fall below the popultion it had in the first 2 years?  no?  then we fine.
---
Wtf how is stating that it looks like bots have moved to high a narrative? How is pointing out that yeah that's probably about as good as realistically possible dismissing that?
---
Given the reaction everyone is having over ChAoS ErA, people might like that.
---
"Oh ye gods! It's a tradegy! He jumped! I only asked him a question to distract him, his favourite colour! I suggested mine was Green and... oh god..."
---
Wow, that takes me back.
---
Good fucking luck with that, it probably will be shit, even more shit than you can possibly imagine...
---
I'm glad you felt valued when I was taking a shit and had my phone in my hand. You are indeed worthy of one extra plop in the toilet.
---
Exactly
---
Being able to reliably cloak + mwd to gates / out of bubbles helps you not get scrammed and webbed?
---
&gt; SanshaLord (Sansha's Nation)
---
CCP is still more successful with Eve than your master is with his incursions.
---
&gt; is there anything that doesn't go into butt mittens
---
Is what I read.
---
Are you trying to say its not hard to make a bot thats smarter than you, Powers?
---
uhmm ok. Maybe its your style of play that makes you think that. I've played since 2005 and this is the most content I've ever had.
---
Plot twist it is Eve that receives an FPS section with the revival of WiS.
---
Omega Super Bot:  ~80-100m tick  
---
Assume 8h/d smart cycle bots, 6d/w.  3 * 8 * 6 * 4 * 100 = 57.6bn/mo  
---
Plex cost trivial, ~0.5 month capital startup cost.  
---
Alpha Hauler + Disco Bot:  ~1m/5min + Mission Isk  
---
A disco bot can pull 1 * 12 * 8 * 6 * 4 = ~2bn/mo  
---
Assume a hauler bot makes 5-10m/h  = 5 * 8 * 6 * 4 = ~1-2bn/mo  
---
So we have a ~3-4bn/mo alpha bot, in high sec, essentially immune to ganks or practically immune via time/cost.  This bot has effectively 0 startup cost, and probably has negative startup costs if you factor in all the SP deals available.  
---
An omega super bot, while making 20x the isk, has near infinite times more cost.  
---
The alpha bot is also way harder to detect unless you just assume anyone who does the activities are all bots too.  Since the alpha startup cost is almost 0, or negative, you can just shit them out to the limit of your hardware.
---
A brawling fleet can warp at 0 on you. It s better than not ;)
---
I’m well aware who he is haha.
---
My phone has mostly been my 5 year old's gaming rig for a long time.. shit is about to get ugly :/
---
Every 5 minute yes. 15 min is for isk tik ;)
---
I dont like pve. Reactions prevent me from needing to do it.
---
There are many machine learning bots that are smarter than all of the people posting on this subreddit.
---
At least the the grass gets watered. Doesn’t look like they have a sprinkler system.
---
I ain’t no expert in goonie things but they definitely was a time when they were pressuring inactive corps to widot into active ones and satellite alliances to widot into goonswarm. They would also refuse a lot of krab corps for lack of active members. They would take the krabs but not as a separate corp.
---
honestly if they would buff the tank on barges and nerf the tank/mining amount on orcas that would be swell. Why would you pick a barge that needs specialized crystals to mine more than a mining rigged orca, can't hold anything, and can die to less than 3 catalysts even when fully tank fit.
---
Edit: just ran the numbers again and at all 5 orcas literally mine as much as a well tanked procurer with t2 mining crystals and a single laser upgrade assuming both are running 4 mining drones and a single combat drone to kill rats. The orca is not an inferior mining choice, has 4.5x the ehp, has 15.5ishx the ore hold, and doesn't have to worry about making sure it's got the right crystals on hand for mining.
---
Honestly, reading the comments in this thread makes me sad. A majority on this sub have been saying bots are gone from the game, data is presented that even though it cannot be said prove bots has moved to HS atleast is making a rather good case. I find it very strange that several corps/alliances all popped up around the same time and filled up with players that fast to do what seems to be certain low level activities.
---
And now people are moving the goalposts about how they are making less isk which is better. Nevermind they can make more bots so they actually make the same in the end. And ofc nevermind the fact that botting was the worst thing in Eve for 2 months but now its suddenly accepted cause its in HS.
---
And never mind that the PCU is filled with these and have been since the beginning of the BO meaning 1: "Its just bots" is now officially a meme and 2: The actual drop is as we have been saying, much much worse.
---
Its just sad guys. Your level of delusion is genuinly sad.
---
shut up gon
---
&gt;I'm a new player
---
If bots keeping an ADM high was the only thing preventing you from doing your thing, you might want to reconsider your life.

Old school !
---
Ah yes an "action MMORPG," very different from all the MMORPGs without action
---
Wait fuck that's EVE
---
\--------------------------
---
**Edit: Oh no boys, it doesn't look good**
---
From the job listing for "Senior Combat Designer"
---
* The Senior Combat Designer will work with the rest of the development team in the creation and maintenance of core combat mechanics, **character abilities**, and combat itemisation
---
* Minimum 3+ years combat design experience on a shipped or live **online multiplayer shooter with both PVP and PVE experience**
---
* (From the "Desirable Skills" section) **Third-person shooter** combat design experience.
---
* Familiarity with the EVE
---
So there we go boys, a third person shooter EVE action MMORPG with character abilities
---
Occasionally datacores become good cash out items for FW LPs, the aren't the highest payout but the datacore market in Jita is very liquid so they're really easy to sell.
---
Like for amarr right now the High Energy Physics datacore can bring in around 600 ISK per LP but the Mechanical Engineering datacores would lose 472 isks per LP.
---
Meanwhile for the Gallente FW, they make 1220 ISK per LP on Electromagnetic Physics datacores... So that could be OK for a gallente to cash out. It's the most liquid item that is over 1200 ISKs/LP.
---
Oh boy nice
---
so not only do you move your goalposts from 
---
&gt;scurry off back into a small wormhole if a target puts up even the minimal resistance  
---
to "a superfleet isn't enough response" (or is it "a superfleet can't kill stukas"?),  
---
you also claim that a battle where a fleet literally went into to fight shit that shoots back somehow refutes the point that a doctrine is used to not just have to fuck off when theres any danger on field. Also Nightmares really aren't exactly bad at hitting small shit as long as it doesn't manage to get too close. Or are you next gonna call people cowards for knowing what positioning is?
---
also for the last one: what do you mean with "lol really?"? you can't blame anyone but tapi that they're too dumb to use their supers properly.  
---
and for the rest, obviously you cut losses if the enemy has a direct counter on field and the possibilities to outmaneuver or outgun them are exhausted. honestly i have no idea what point you're even trying to make at this point. "fighting people is cowardice if you refuse to feed into a direct counter"? I guess in your... 10 years? of playing you never FC'd a fleet.
---
honestly man im starting to have my doubts that you're just pretending.
---
hardpillstoswallow.jpg
---
Not wormholers btw
---
&gt;NetEase
---
Ew
---
If "my thing" is sleeping, then yes. Lower ADMs = a wider range of times when you can kill ihubs and TCUs. When you play USTZ and the area you're working to clear is set to CN TZ, the lower ADMs make a huge difference.
---
Edited.
---
And I guess that'll depend on how you can interact with them from both sides; if they give regular local it will be system wide and not alliance-only, would be completely retarded otherwise.
---
Sometimes you'll run into extremely salty and toxic players while flying, but in most corps you'll end up getting to know a bunch of nice people that will be willing to help you out. Like when I first started playing, I got [killed](https://zkillboard.com/kill/58024109/) by someone who then paid for my ship 10x over and spent 30 minutes giving me advice on how to improve. I took that experience to heart, and have found that most people are willing to help you if you just ask. That experience really shaped how I approach the game, and I'll pay for any new player's ship that I kill and convo them to tell them what they could improve in similar situations.
---
It could always be the first person shooter they were trying to do in house. Now maybe outsourcing for a real project manager?
---
Jesus, you’re a total unmitigated cunt!
---
As usual you must be commended on your input Maria tokila.
---
Don't know. I missed the Dust Era, but would love an Eve-based FPS honestly
---
Probably easier to catch as well. Lower ticks/mineral yield forces higher numbers of accounts being used and longer periods to use them.
---
Glassdoor has "must be familiar with EVE" and "must be familiar with PC and Console"
---
...they're going to release some bastardized version of an EVE Online and Dust 514 offspring for console and PC
---
s7 edge.
---
From what I've heard so far, Eve Echoes is actually quite decent. I haven't had a chance to play it yet since getting my code, but who knows, maybe this could be not shit as well?
---
Obligatory dig: Are you looking forward to having more CCP products to cry about?
---
Pretty sure that was done with the anticipation of having at least one other entity in the game capable of combating them at the time, but history has shown us this was not to be.
---
i dont get it, can someone explain?
---
It will work out this time.
---
OnePlus 5T isn't compatible either... It's a Chinese phone, come on!
---
CCP found a new side project to waste money and Hilmars efforts on, EVE is saved!
---
So I’m the piece of shit for thinking mittens was wrong for his actions. I think your idea of who has some mental illness is kinda fucked. Mebbe you might wanna consider getting some help and moving forward.
---
because not everyone is at home and able to play eve
---
His premise is wrong though, and is the foundation of the elite pvp mindset.
---
&gt;less players that are more active  
---
This is literally the definition of 'elite pvp'.
---
The same elite pvpers who will chose to spend time hunting afk ratting cruisers rather than fight eachother.
---
It is only in alpha testing but man they got it pretty good and the controls are pretty good on converting over from PC. The skill tree is the main thing that is different from the PC version, definitely will take some time to get used to.  It definitely eats hell of a lot of battery, a little under 30 minutes burned 10% of my battery on my pixel 2 xl.
---
Ive noticed that multiple pilot training are almost the same cost as a subscription if you are paying plex from in game.  Buy a MPT is more expensive than a sub if you are paying real $ in the CCP store(1).  And if you are buying them with ISK in game the MPT is much cheaper.
---
What is causing this price discrepancy?  Or the real question, where are people acquiring the MPTs from if selling them for ISK cheaper than subs makes sense?
---
(1) I actually misread the screen and bought one this way figuring it was for both other characters on an account.  Lesson learned, dont be me people.
---
Take it a step further, how much should CCP hurt the playerbase for each additional percent of bots squashed? 
---
Probably less than they have already. It's never been an issue worth ruining the game. When bots effect the game less negatively than CCP it's time to think real hard about future changes to avoid this.
---
The fact that you even think eve has an 'end game' makes me not want to read the rest of your post.
---
FC wut (do I) do?
---
If they could do that they probably would've made the 10 bots back when the botting was good. Running tons of VMs is hard; most botters are limited more by hardware than by in-game limitations.
---
Levels 4s were one of the hardest things to bot, since you had spatial triggers, entitiy triggers, site travel, site geometry, looting, system travel.  Keep in mind, at the time there was already Belt-Bots, Market-Bots, Hauling-Bots, the l4 mission bot was the last one to be made since it needed a database of mission data.
---
Exploration bots are quite common now, all that was needed was someone to build a logic tree for the 'game', but most of the tool-makers quit before the modern no-brain scanning system.  Realtime OCR has been possible for a decade.  CCP even made QOL changes to the probe system that allow full automation...
---
Mining bots are the thing that has the least incentive
---
This just shows how clueless you are.
---
Imagine all these bots still being active and the amount of online players is still only 15k
---
Its pretty neat, took a bit to find all the controls but this so far looks like a really good version
---
The amount of players logged in is the lowest it's been in a very long time.
---
&gt; Lower ticks/mineral yield forces higher numbers of accounts being used and longer periods to use them.
---
That's if you maintain the same; which you don't if you bot - because you're not botting EVE for profit - but to build your titan or afford your accounts. Just like you may have cut down your pilots as we all may have - the botters can as well. 
---
That is to say, you don't need to feed your daughter from botting - so you can just cut some subscriptions and slowly amass your net worth. There is no need to increase workload if you feel you're under the radar and doing well. It's a massive cut, but any isk that you didn't have to do jack shit for - when we all don't have much precious time to begin with.
---
"Large Scale PVP engagements"?
---
You mean ships that died to keepstar weapons?
---
Super ratting? Never owned a rorq huh
---
Also show me this super ratting bot. Sounds like a fairly tale for utterly complicated it is
---
no it means in large battles
---
I may add this post to the main OP
---
Read: Not necessarily and some people just stop botting because it may be deemed not worth it for several reasons.
---
Lots of players on a single area with real time gameplay and no TIDI.
---
They were testing the server software.
---
What the gameplay was like on client side was mostly meaningless. It was there just to lure players in.
---
It's a test. It's meant for testing.
---
Played for about 10 min, i'm at work and no charger so did not want my phone 100% dead.  it was really fun, warping and navigation feels like eve.  just need to figure out how to make isk..
---
the skill system for this looks a bit different.. but we will see how things play out
---
Aww, don't be like that, he just needs a good douching.
---
LOL
---
I was thinking like communication issues where they would respond but with unexpected results. Maybe you get shot by mistake or they do nothing and warp off or they could help.
---
All I was aware of is people not being able to get in and having issues. Not sure if that's part of the testing, or the information they were hoping to get from it wasn't able to be done due to issues
---
why do you assume they live there? they can already scan down data sites, why not wormholes to change wormhole systems?
---
Its nice that you had forgiveness in your heart, log-of-shit
---
You're reading OP's post wrong unfortunately. Let's take OP's timings as fixed... Killed at 2000. Logs in 6hours later at 0400, finds he was killed, posts on reddit at 0500. 12 hours prior to logging in was 1600...
---
it is alpha, this might be a feature in the full game?
---
you act like its just bots that are leaving nullsec when it's actually people leaving the game all together
---
Banderlogs has a ton of bots running burners all day long in pure blind out of 5ZXX
---
None yet, you just pick a generic portrait, at least i did not see a creation.  i assume thats because its an alpha
---
It was a joke and a reference to the Goon invasion of Tribute.
---
Shhh don't ruin the narrative
---
Um, most of CODE are botting on these alts...
---
Yeah, I got my Motorola Razr.  If it can run Doom, it should run Eve right?
---
RGR-JMPG
---
the economic recovery won't really start until they severely limit the ore site respawns and infinite combat anoms
---
Lmao no they weren't
---
I've been enjoying watching it since it began. It's been am exciting debacle and everything I said at the start of blackout is slowly coming true.
---
No I believe technically this is Epic's issue with their build optimizer.  In theory it would work as well as Unity's, but in reality it flags a ton of stuff as 'always pack'.  My understanding is this is due to certain high end phones being able to run almost full feature openGL, and so 'technically they should pack the entire engine.  
---
This is also why you often see odd hardware limitations or requirement for UE4 mobile apps, as the developer did not take the time to make a true proper mobile build and just used the default builtin mobile packer.  
---
IIRC people have experimented with super-portable UE4 instances under 1mb, but I could be remembering the size wrong here.
---
No, I'm sure some people have left nullsec or the game. I'm also 100% sure that none of the accounts that were ratting in Fade were actual humans. 
---
Also, what the hell's the problem here, anyway? I live in null in a small group with no umbrella, and while I might die a bit more often than pre-blackout, it's not \*much\* more often, and I can still manage to rat and mine and do explo just fine. Everyone in our corp uses their brain occasionally and doesn't rat completely alone; with a few on and active, you can protect yourself and your buddies reasonably well. Sometimes we get dropped by a group we can't handle, and oh well - it's almost like "don't undock what you can't afford to lose" means something now.
---
36 dreads vs  2 Titans 1 super 10 carrier 14 dreads and 3 fax.   Gonna say TEST is still ahead on this one.
---
Well, I'm going to assume you guys either missed their timezones or they refused to feed to your blob of Loki's
---
generic isometric twin stick shooter.
---
aka, a diablo clone?
---
This will go well
---
But you still immediately emergency warp if you force quit, so rats targeting you shouldn’t matter because you’re in a “safe” while the timer counts down.  If a rat has pointed you, that’s another story .
---
In the days when Therapists look like old PL on a battle report.
---
Dude who in this game actually wants fade. I'd sooner go to syndicate
---
k m8
---
I would fuck with Dust 2.0 if thats what this is.
---
Are you familiar with “the eve”?
---
Imagine thinking I'm actually Inner Hell. Beans were garbage and would undock like once a month, nothing of value was lost.
---
Is there even a tutorial? Mine just shat me into a station and didnt say a word.
---
I just have to know one thing, can you spin?
---
vOv just from personal experience I always got a fight
---
Killing tcu and ihub. The only thing missing from your post is citadel timer. Then you would have listed the actual problems that discourage war
---
But no, local and cynos are what killing the game 🙄
---
Google "eve online supercarrier bot" and see what turns up.
---
Read: The dudes not irredeemable and CCP reprimanded him,he lost character and face in this community and beyond. That can follow him based on the path he takes in life. Give it a rest.
---
Edit: The irony is the dude responding to bo_hunt obviously had a hate boner
---
It s still there. They want people to participate at minimum 2-5 strat op per month. But you can participate as newb like brave / ph / dreddit also i suppose.
---
You will find that people in EVE are made of harder, sterner stuff than your average MMO Player, and can take much more abuse and obscene language while other weak stomached players couldn't take even one second of it without dropping their monocle.
---
I got kicked from a FFXIV "guild" just for saying "ur gay pwned" in good fun, a very popular saying here in EVE in similar intent to a Rickroll. True story.
---
More whining. If you're too scared to use Flash, just don't comment and move on, coward.
---
Not near the satisfaction in ganking a bot vs a clueless new player so CODEdot is likely gonna leave them alone **OR** CODEdot is secretly running the highsec botting/rental ring /tinfoil
---
You can still cloak mwd with t1 cloak?
---
I saw I have an access code. Created a char. No Aura. That's not Eve!
---
No, no, no... remember... the lower login numbers are just bots leaving because of the blackout! All of those RMTers just got new jobs instead of moving to botting level 4 missions, level 5 missions, static plexes, the market, or faction warfare. Obviously.
---
Yes you can!
---
mcts are often acquired with discounts and/or as part of a pack
---
I mean you do have to cta for more fleets than usual if you're fighting 2 of the 3 biggest coalitions in the game
---
So far its quite good.
---
It's over 3x slower.
---
&gt;I haven't really played much...
---
Proceeds to go in depth about the state of the game
---
\^\^ this
---
Dumbass hordelings neg repping because using a clock is too damn hard man.
---
Once you have then figured out, most burner missions are actually extremely simple but you need to have a fairly specific ship/fit/implants depending on the mission.  
---
For a bot they are probably *easier* to code for, at least the agents and teams.    I've never ran a base so I can't speak to those.
---
For teams, for example...
---
Warp to mission.
---
Activate acceleration gate.
---
On landing, activate prop mods and tank/SBs/etc, orbit burner at whatever the safe distance is.
---
Load ammo for logi.
---
At appropriate range, target logi then burner.
---
At appropriate range, activate ewar and weapons.
---
Kill first logi, kill second logi.
---
Load burner ammo.
---
Kill burner.
---
Approach and loot.
---
Return to home or whatever.
---
It took "6 hours" because it turns out the OP was very bad at telling the difference between EVE time and his local clock.
---
Let's see how much money gets dumped into this 'unannounced' MMO before it too goes the way of World of Darkness.
---
This explains why orthrus are cheap as shit &gt;:(
---
Mittens hasn’t lost much, still in charge of his band of morons. Still doing his super douche antics. Seems like he is still being a general asshat. I’m over it,
---
Don't you also start mate... OP post timings check out. Don't make this political
---
I'll just stick to Escape from Tarkov thx.
---
Pretty interesting and thought out idea. I'm not entirely sure if it's better or worse than the current change CCP did, since a cyno lit by new list of ships can be blapped pretty quickly depending on what you have on grid, but it's definitely interesting
---
Mittens needs you to go back to sucking his cock.
---
&gt; Best they learn that lesson with something relatively cheap like an inflatable pool than something expensive later.
---
Or a younger sibling on their heels.
---
CCP please stop failing at this side projects. Fix Eve first then you can fail at another 5 projects again.
---
Jesus fucking christ. FUcking. Fuck. FUCK. FUCKA YOUUUUUUU
---
CCP can't even copy paste correct
---
NO G WORD!
---
&gt;all the do is add 9 alpha accounts
---
why didn't they do this before?
---
ah, the naive 'hardware is infinite' fallacy
---
&gt;ah, the naive 'hardware is infinite' fallacy
---
Orrrrrrrrr, you just make everything a hyper strat omega call to ultimate frog action op and the enemy never knows how to form.
---
When the hot games of 2019 are WoW Classic and MineCraft, maybe EvE had the right idea up until now
---
"Welcome to our 'ool'.    
---
 Notice there is no 'p' in it.    
---
 Let's keep it that way."
---
u/uwutranslator
---
My fingers have been crossed that these would eventually come. As we all know. Things to fight over is one of the major underlying issues with the current stagnation in null. These could be a step in the right direction. 
---
They should make them semi spamable, maybe more than a asshouse but less than a fort. But also make them relatively easy to kill with no timers, by a decent small/medium gang. 
---
If you want to keep local up your gonna have to keep putting them down as they are killed. 
---
A sink for resources, an objective for small gangs that is productive. Offers counter play all around. 
---
System ping: Com Beacon in system dickbutte-bj is being attacked. Form up and respond. No response? Op success for small gang. Local goes down. Are they just trolling or is it cover for bridging in a bigger fleet?
---
Or spent another 20 mil on your ship and get tackled by a t1 frigate and die.  Which has happened, many times.   Without guns, you lose options.  Even if you can travel cloaked faster.  Can usually burn back to gate with t1 anyway, that's not what kills me usually.  I almost never die while cloaked or burning back to gate.  It's usually on initial warp in or burn out.  I think the majority of kill mails back me up here too.  Not to mention that faction extenders can't support the weight of everyone.  
---
BTW, 4 large t2 is 1200 damage.  Probe is 1000 hp.   If they have faction, can be 3, but usually 4 is the number I say.
---
This is why when I FC'd we did not use the word jump for gates. We used "walrus" and it worked. Mostly.
---
Ah, I remember that. It was part of the most successful Eve update of the past, wasn't it?
---
one could only wish
---
Why are you getting tackled by T1 frigates on a sabre alt, why are you trying to solo stuff with a tackle alt? I don't get it?
---
&gt;Obligatory dig: Are you looking forward to having more CCP products to cry about?
---
he was happy to defend them pre blackout
---
really shows you how much consistency matters to him
---
'I WAS IN THE POOL!'
---
Slower how? Cloak reactivation? Velocity modifier?
---
Well most apps are 0.5-1GB these days.      
---
Larger apps like navigation software and 3d games can take up to 5-10 gigs.      
---
But also phones have higher resolution displays than most desktop monitors, hexa- and octocore CPU's, 4-8gb of RAM and 64-512GB of internal memory. Also Extendable by 512 additional gigs (SD card).      
---
So nothing out of the ordinary. Its time for the future, my friend.
---
I'm pretty sure that's a repost for a Combat Designer for project Nova. Either they still didn't find one or fired the last one.
---
Cloaked velocity, the T1 cloak slows you down to like 400m/s so you're almost completely relying on your inertia from before cloaking to get you back to the gate.
---
Neither of which are surprising
---
i cant tell if people in this sub are serious or not anymore
---
its a gundam
---
I use F1-F4 and if i need more than that I don't fly the ship. (sort of kidding). I'll use F5-F8 for other stuff that I use less (cap boosters, shield boosters, etc.)
---
It's in the video, but I know you won't watch it so not sure why we need to debate it.
---
It could also be looked at as a "local disabling structures". They seem to be faction based and not upwell consortium. This leads me to believe that these may already be put in place in low/high security systems by CCP. My guess is that people can come in and hack or blast them away to turn local off.
---
2:1
---
But a sabre alt should be like tackling and not approaching kestrels, gimping your fit to feed slightly less to kestrels is dumb
---
While nullseccers were fart sniffing themselves into a coma watching a rising MER destroy the economy at large, most wormholers have been practically begging CCP to nerf safe wormhole income and bring down blue loot income.
---
Spin harder.
---
But what will you do when you escape?
---
I'm not so sure CCP wants the players to have a hand in the design with blackout or Cynos.
---
isnt that the game with a smaller active playerbase than eve?
---
Large whales can't light cynos w/ the update. Solved the issue...
---
Not an issue for sabres. Would be an issue for bigger ships, but if you have 2 nanos in the lows I think you get like 3-4s align time, which, if you mwd cloak correctly, will set you at the 75% velocity or whatever to warp
---
The only benefit of t2 cloak is being able to lock things faster after decloaking
---
could just not give mining bonuses to non-mining ships like the orca and rorqual.
---
Do they have friendly fire enabled or whatever the hell it's called. If so go terrorize!
---
Black out my ass
---
It's not to cloak mwd into warp but rather to cloak + mwd around the grid without getting decloaked all the time.
---
PLSDOCK
---
Hmm, I think I like this idea better than the proposed cyno changes.
---
Sorry, you forgot your citations. Why not complain about rage rolling changing or something. Stop taking offense to the damn idea and identifying with a group. Take it less personal
---
with plex at the price they are, botting has never been as unprofitable as it is now - yet apparently now botting is a huge problem when it's pretty much the least viable it has ever been for trying to fund yourself via rmt.
---
every change that isn't just "ban the fucking bots" just makes the game shit for actual players who want to play.
---
FYI, these objects specifically are placeholders - there are parts of the actual, full models in SISI's files for a "comms station", "connection", and "space elevator", parts of which you can see as the "holograms" outside the constructions themselves in Jita on SISI.
---
Yeah it's pretty toxic in a lot of places, but also you can find not so toxic areas as well.
---
As I said, I explain in the video why.  It's you versus the world, man.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/78807927/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78807927/)  You still die with t2.  [https://zkillboard.com/item/11577/](https://zkillboard.com/item/11577/)  Not used by many sabres.
---
Just not as often because majority people use t1.   [https://zkillboard.com/item/11370/](https://zkillboard.com/item/11370/)
---
But keep tilting against those windmills, I'm sure you'll win soon.
---
&gt; Sounds like a fairly tale for utterly complicated it is
---
so all the supers that ccp teleport to high sec to publicly execute on GM week were all actually innocent?
---
My (vague) understanding is that most of the problems people reported -- trouble logging in, shitty interface, etc -- were incidental to what they were actually testing (how far can you push server load before lag kicks in).
---
There's probably still testing to be done, but there's a lot of data they can get even from that.
---
That would be fucking amazing tbh. Don't bring my hopes that high please...
---
Carrier, yes. Titan, most likely a no. They rarely die and the payout doesn’t warrant the isk needed for the insurance.
---
Good eye, dude.
---
It makes it extremely difficult to bomb the fleet. Since bombers have to warp practically on top of the fleet they will get dragged into the bubble and most likely caught.
---
Because everyone else uses T1 it's better?
---
F1, the answer is always F1
---
Black Desert Online just in the Eve Universe?
---
&gt; Also if two frigates attempt to chase a sabre of any sort you should be able to just leave lol
---
No you can't.
---

Thank god hilmar found a new side project to fail

THE RUMORS THAT HE WAS SHOCING THIS THROUGH BEFORE OCTOBER ARE TRUE ROFL
---
Small gang tackle Keres says no. Interceptors will also lock you and point you before you can warp off.
---
Having guns helps drive off frigates, watching you try and pretend that isn't a thing is hilarious though, all for a t2 cloak.
---
Hello Games x CCP
---
Destiny knock off
---
already cancelled
---
Project Nova?
---
So one of the things you're trying to say is that they've written bot programs so sophisticated that they can scan down data and gas sites and run them? Keep reaching man
---
It does seem that a lot of players are leaving null sec because the AFK/Bot ISK train is over. If the worst thing about this is they make shit amounts of ISK botting in high sec rather than milking null sec like a fat cow, then so be it. Still doesn't mean that Blackout was bad, it was a major step in the right direction. 
---
Chaos still winning. Get used to it scrub. No matter how much propaganda you guys post or vote brigading you try, you're never gonna meta this away.
---
You have to cloak + warp for ceptors but most T1 crap cannot lock you, and besides you're not catching a stiletto in a sabre. Are you seriously arguing that Horde has a better sabre fit than Hydra, Volta, Scourge, Darkside, Skill U, etc because of 1v1ing kestrels?
---
Low effort native advertising
---
Gotta have structures for that
---
I happened to find this on ArtStation while researching the Angel Cartel's ships. I know the concept drawings have been posted here before, but I don't think we've ever been shown how the artist came up with them, which is included in this link. I particularly like how he based their appearance on animal skulls, it makes them very distinctive.
---
A mobile game. It is EVE on a phone.
---
So bots are rolling WHs now?
---
Word. I’ve always had an issue with this statement. Null isn’t safe because of some mysterious reason. SOME regions of null are safe because the organizations who live there have made them safe. 
---
Yes, Delve is generally safe, but you can’t say the same about other areas of null. 
---
Imagine for a minute: what if other null groups had done similar and fortified their areas, built up huge armadas and we had these titanic clashes between massive empires, like the ones that supposedly put us in the news and on the map.  That would be pretty cool eh. 
---
Instead we get fucking whiners that are too elite to pve. “This is a PvP game! I don’t do krabbing...carebear”
---
And then they whine more when someone out paces them In legitimate areas of gameplay.
---
Really, bots can scan now? How exactly are they doing that? I would love to hear this
---
Still takes a person to run a bot any way you look at it. But agree bots probably aren't going anywhere soon.
---
Would think half the reason for the black out is to potentially drain the pockets of the "super rich" blocks, or at least force them to actively man the gates for intel. Not doing so means krab losses, cap or sub-cap. Or they'll just modify their bots to a different discovery system and go from there. Yet during that development stage, they have a choice to unsub or hope they can sustain the losses by those seeking "content".   
---
As far as newbros/players go, they lose a ship or two, they might as well unsub while waiting for someone to throw isk at them for replacements. If only because they have jack left to work with while training up to be otherwise "useful". We were all there once, and I find it amusing how many have forgotten those days.
---
The point is most of us want chaos changes that make things far more dangerous to krab. 
---
More random wormholes, like way more. Make it impossible to close your static (new static spawns either instantly or 30 secs after being rolled to not give krabs in your new static a heads up before you can scan), **scrams** to all wormhole rats in all classes. Fucking delete astrahaus farming or better yet get them to no damage cap reinf them like they did in kspace.
---
Bring on the chaos, one thing mittani cum garglers have right is that wormholes are unironically safter to rat in now than NS.
---
i'd be cool with destiny in the eve universe tbh
---
Exploration bots? How exactly are they able to navigate the scan interface?
---
The first big fight i got into with Horde was  in corms against Goons when they were hitting an NPC Sotiyo. I listened to "Flight of the Valkyries" the entire time it was awesome.
---
NCUNDOCK
---
Yes, but I wasn’t thinking of only bots.
---
Super ratting was turbo simple just tedious, that equals  complicated don't ya know?
---
I think this might cause the same problem that the present changes are likely going to cause.  While in a purely hunter v prey scenario, the situation you described sounds more engaging, capital fleet v capital fleet fights would become more about who takes grid first.
---
I was actually kind of amazed how good it looked. Like as in EVE-running-running-on-a-half-decent-laptop good.
---
You can't restart the game to get a level playing field because the true advantage in eve is the player organizations more than the in-game assets.
---
You're the only one bringing up kestrels bud, and those guys use throw away alts as dictor pilots where they're not really paying that much attention to that account, dictors are often considered "fire and forget" in most instances.
---
YOU asked why 0.0 groups fit differently, and the answer is directly "because they operate differently".  
---
Pro tip bud, just because one of the groups you consider "elite" uses a specific fit for what they do, doesn't mean that same fit will work for what other groups do, OR that that fit is even that great.  Its just exactly what that particular group needs to serve its purpose.
---
So how does fitting a t2 cloak make it inferior for nullsec? Do you guys not have the ability to afford 3m cloaks?
---
OP5 here, can't wait
---
I'll explain again, because you're doing the 'But someone is wrong on the internet!'  Even though I explain in the video.  But then again, the video isn't for you, I guess.  This is just 6 years of just flying dictors as pretty much my only ship.  I even gave a talk at Eve Vegas, which you also won't watch, talking about how great they are. :v  
---
Faction hardeners cannot hold up the load if everyone uses them.  Period.  That is enough.  
---
It's another 20 mil minimum, even if prices remain the same.  I lost 10 last month.  The last thing I want to be thinking about is 'but this is the expensive fit one!', I want something that is just going to go do what the FC says to do.  And expect to get paid around 80 mil back for doing so, so who cares, it's the FC's money.  
---
Not everyone has perfect skills.  Most of Horde doesn't, for instance.  Not everyone can even fit with the fit I recommend and have to use the faction extenders.  CPU is short all around.  
---
I love a scram because it gives me options.  And scramming people as they escape is awesome.  Good luck fitting a scram on yours with an additional CPU on it.  Doing combat scramming is something that I do, regularly, while the fleet reps me.  A sabre can tank it if a retribution isn't there.  
---
T2 guns give you barrage, which you need to have a chance to drive off any of the long point inties.  And even that is dicey.  T1 guns, you have zero chance.  
---
You give up a ton to be able to 'burn back to gate'.  I'm almost never losing them to that situation.  Like almost ever.  I cannot remember the last time that at t2 cloak would have helped.  In this video, I even blow a double cloak and still get back to gate no problem.  
---
Reducing the delay on the targeting, sure, that might help, but at what a price of 30 CPU in a short CPU ship.  
---
Your build: buy in jita at 108.4 mil, 9.3k efhp, 38.2 ehp/s, scan res 412 mm, 119 m/s cloaked, 10s reactivation time, 279 signature mwding, scan res 412 mm, 133 dps, better range  
---
(I used same ammo as mine, assumed the core probe launcher is offline to fit.)  
---
My build: buy in jita at 88.6 mil, 8.84k efhp, 35.8 ehp/s, scan res 344 mm, 47.4 m/s cloaked, 15s reactiviation time, 316 signature mwding, scan res 344 mm, 149 dps, worse range  
---
* in summary, the good stuff for your improved fit:
---
* 5.2% more buffer
---
* 6.7% more peak recharge
---
* More DPS range (honestly good)
---
* 19.7% more scan res
---
* 251% faster cloaked
---
* 12% smaller
---
* 100% more ship scanner and optional probe launcher  
---
* The bad stuff:
---
* 22.3% more expensive
---
* 11% more dps (meh who cares)
---
* 100% less scraming
---
* If people buy it in bulk, the faction extender market fails to hold the load of the most popular ship to lose in the entire goddamn game, and all of them use two of them.  
---
So yes, I lost 10 last month.   Your t2 cloak would have saved 0 of them because lol who loses ships burning back to gate anymore.  And because it's 22.3% more expensive, that's what similar to 2 extra ones I have to pay for.  But hey, maybe I would have been able to use that 20% scan res to tackle something oh wait I can't fit a scram.  But hey, at least I could help out those LP farmers in high sec as they struggle.  And it's not like I'm struggling for money, far from it.  But why? it wouldn't have helped, and only hurt.  And I would have missed a lot of hunting targets because i couldn't scram them.  
---
On the 30th, a massive peak of 2,682 faction hardeners were sold in jita.  Low points were 332 on the 22nd.  Last month, 157 sabres were lost a day.  You're talking about 314 faction hardeners lost per day if you're saying everyone should go to t2.  The peak is most likely just trading mechanics too.  It has been demonstrated that you cannot just throw away faction equipment and expect the market not react.  
---
And again, I demonstrate in the video why you need the scram.  If you care to watch it.  But you won't because you're convinced you're right because EFT warrioring.

Why on earth they chose dread/carrier/titan instead of carrier/super/titan is beyond me.

But it's not even on TQ. Joke's on you.
---
World online twerking competitions is in development right now using sensors and accelerometers for the kind of pelvic rhythms so complex they require fourier analysis.  Last month someone literally compressed a lumbar disk.
---
Darwinism at work.
---
Site scanning bots have been a thing for a long time but judging by your illogical misinformed grr nullsec post I can only assume you have never been in 0.0 to observe them.
---
Ergan? Is that you?
---
NPC space in drones confirmed?
---
Obviously these need to be cracked down on. It's still better for the game that bot accounts are collecting small amounts of minerals in high sec rather than printing large amounts of isk in null, though.
---
You're going to need to provide some decent evidence for your claim that running data sites in wormholes is bot activity.
---
The fleet dictors want guns bud, the t2 cloak does NOTHING for a fleet dictor.
---
Why are you making this rocket science?  Your original post starts with 
---
&gt;Honest question why do nullsec alliance sabre fits already default to T1 cloak + guns
---
But judging from your responses to people you really didn't want to know, you just want people to fit like you want, which obviously doesn't work for them and its frustrating you.
---
One guy has even broken it down with bullet points and zkill links and you still refuse to wrap your brain around the idea that people use what works best for them.
---
Damn, he got you there.  
---
Please note, I'm no longer in PL, but the 'update flair' option has been limited and I'm reluctant to give up my eve name. :)  Now in horde, so yes, 3 million cloaks are too expensive.
---
That is just a balancing act of numbers - range of effect vs effect on a fight.  But yes, this would have an effect on cap vs cap fights, but only in that you can't jump in ships within the range.  So the complexity of the fight goes up.  Do you want to block yourself from pulling in reinforcements while protecting yourself from the enemy cynoing in on top of you?  What if you get someone in the other fleet to cyno-block their own fleet?  Can you get a gaggle of interceptors to warp to zero, drop these on the enemy fleet to disrupt their entry into the battle?
---
All of these are chaotic factors that are introduced via player agency.  It is *NOT* imposed by developer fiat.
---
It is the difference between tactics and environment.  One promotes tactical decision making, the trade off necessary to manage the fight.  The other is just a factor of the landscape and affects everyone equally without the ability for players to truly effect.
---
Lol, another failure incoming
---
&gt;Gila ratting wasn't affected since they now mine in ventures and do highsec data sites in Herons
---
OP with some pristine logic. Show me on the doll where the blackout touched you.

The thing I like about Angels (and Sansha, I think Blood Raiders as well) is that they have actual unique designs for each hull.

Its even worse, he's convinced he's right because its what he sees the "elite" groups doing without actually understanding whats going on.

Co springs most of us.

I got a better solution. Remove cynos from the game entirely. Make all the going supers have to gate everywhere.

it's a space D8

Try asking ccp

You forget that an alpha VNI bot could get 15 mil ticks with no startup cost so almost 10 bil/month.

I dunno, they could have picked FoxLethal...

then add 9 alphas in nullsec VNIs for 10x more isk dumbass

Would I be able to run ded solo in a T3 dessie? (hecate)

Good, now CODE. can actually do what they claim to stand for. Go bump ventures.

Bad-at-their-job hunters whined and got the blackout, but no one else can whine and get something?

I could go the provi to hunt those newer players. I find hunting a lot of fun xD
---
So T2 cloak doesn't work for you because you don't have the skills for it?
---
Old news
---
These have been around for how many years now?
---
If someone bitches about the left being toxic, it's logical to assume they're coming from the right.  If someone bitches about the right, it's logical to assume that they're coming from the left side of the aisle.
---
As you've described it, there just seem to be a lot of ways in which one could disrupt the enemy from getting in effectively.  And while grid control should be an advantage, I think things like this might push that advantage over the edge.
---
That all said, this idea is far better and more 'chaotic' than this force recon limited idea that CCP is pushing.
---
I'm not saying Eve is dying but CCP is beating a dead horse on the Eve world. Maybe just once branch out and diversify.
---
If wormholers wanted to krab safely they would join Goons. People live in wormholes for the fights
---
Yup, that's why I play it at work.
---
Does the damage to energy crystals affect how the weapon performs? Tracking? Damage? Falloff? Range?
---
Hi. Im returning EVE player and would like to know few things if possible. Hope this is proper topic, instead of creating new one.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
As a heads up:  
---
- I was member of small (80 ppl) corp operating in wormhole (c2-c5)  
---
- mostly did ganks/camps etc  
---
- Coming back to eve after 3 years of absence (hence would like to learn the ropes again)  
---
- I know that most money lies in ns/wh, yet till i learn how to not be a debris, i would like to check what hisec has to offer  
---
- My "main" is shaped mostly toward L4 security missions (that means 11m sp, cruise t2, drones t2 (light, med, sentry. Heavy en route to t2), Rattlesnake - not much but it's mine :P)  
---
In those "boundaries" I will ask below questions :P  
---
so my noob questions are as follows:  
---
- Is there any activity in hisec which would yield enough isk to buy plex/omega, if yes, what is is and what timeframe are we talking about (20hrs of doing said activity? 40? 50? etc). I know that it costs like 10 euros and for now Im paying for omega like that, yet i would like to ask if there's option in EVE to play and earn enough to pay for omega with isk (in reasonable amount of time. not like doing L1's from now till eternity).  
---
- I have secondary account or alts (so 3 total) I did loooong time ago (up to 3.5m sp max), but they were skilled in "ancient times" (2009-2011) so the skill choices may resemble early days of my play (and errors of it). So is it better to transfer all assets to my main, remove accounts, and create new ones now properly or to skill them up to be occassional sp farms as alphas (so like quarterly drain of a large injector?)  
---
- Follow up question to above. What alts should i have or what alts it would be good to have? Those I have are "industry/PI" alt (said 3,5m sp. Yet most of industry is in boundaries of alpha clone, and PI is bound to omega, so I cannot use it, and I would like to refrain from paying for 2 omegas atm). The other is explo (1.5m (mostly drones, scanning)) and final is mining (2,3m (mining barge, resource processing))  
---
- What activities small team can partake in? Im playing with 1-2 friends (so 3 total), and currently we're doing L4 missions. Is there anything else reasonably safe, and entertaining for such small amount of ppl?  
---
If you arrived here, thanks for reading this small text wall, if you answered to my questions, thanks :)
---
Go back in for more loot!

---
Ahh im up in foco, most of the guys i know are south denver
---
&gt; How about instead of just killing local, you create a way for players to make local if they want?
---
Because then nullblobs just put local back in all their ratting systems and nothing was gained.
---
Oh no.... :(
---
Is there a way to select the plane in which the ship will orbit something?
---
I'm dissapointed to be honest. They dumbed the... wrong things down I guess, to my feeling atleast.  
---
Skills are not intuitive, there are also so many modules and shiptypes around that the market becomes a mess.  
---
Although not implemented yet, its clear they kept the special shiptypes, as in all of them. On a screen that already reduces most of the action to pinsize, having to mess around with interdictors and all seems like a soul crushing exercise in patience.  
---
No part of it in itself is bad really. And its great in a way that they translated the complexity of EVE to a mobile platform, in large part atleast.  
---
I just don't think a game as complex as EVE: Echoes is longterm enjoyable on mobile. Everything feels cluttered interface wise.
---
CCP helping to make nullblocks even richer, tut tut.
---
&gt; What do you think, how much difference it have when it have to watch the overview instead of the local list? Yeah, a little less secure.
---
It's massively less secure because local tells you exactly who is logged on in the system right now. Watching overview on a gate tells you nothing about people logging off in system, jumping in through a wormhole, getting bridged in and so on, and if you miss someone you don't get to see it in local.
---
If watching overview on a scout was really as good as local then nullblobbers wouldn't be complaining about losing local, would they?
---
"Maybe you get shot by mistake"  
---
Too easily exploited. It would just start the era of ganking with rookie ships.
---
Last time that happened Test revoked our docking access halfway through the fight. I don’t think there were any feroxes in the TTT but we had been using it to resupply on ammo and cap boosters. I’d guess that during any serious fight test would just remove docking permissions from everyone not part of otec 2.0 or whatever it’s called
---
That's better, fits all the needs.  Not going to lie.  
---
But BRB, doing nothing.
---
pretty sure the carrier became the zarmazd
---
This man has never done Drugs.
---
I think it is an inconsistent resolution issue, stemming from how many years the game's been around for and what gets considered "good enough for now" versus "we should really do this better right now"; and from that, when the ships were most recently revised. The Caldari probably have gotten hit the most by this, because of how gonk asymmetrical so many of their old hull models were. (Like if you want massive asymmetry go back to the Gallente you literally fought a war over this)
---
4 mil x 1000 bots is still good isk
---
How is it "to easy to exploit" if you don't know what's going to happen?. And to top that off it doesn't stop any rational player from fighting back.
---
I hear people claim botting in a lot of things. I've only ever confirmed a handful.
---
You are my hero
---
That does appear to be the case, doesn't it... although let me fix the statement to be more accurate:
---
&gt;I'm not so sure ~~CCP~~ *Hilmar* wants ~~the players~~ *actual developers* to have a hand in the design with blackout or Cynos.
---
What system do you live in?
---
Oh boy, Silent Company. I actually know this. My old corporation with the people that got me into the game hopped through being a goon pet to ChaosTheory corp to Sorts meatshield alliance. When ChaosTheory left we quit them and went to highsec to reconsolidate and figure out what we wanted to do. CEO decided to recruit a bunch of noobs to act as an education corp and feed to various other groups. Me and some guys from the original corp left for other corps and currently recruit from within Silent Company. 
---
The Russian involvement is entirely Ikarus being approached and told "hey we have Russian noobs, can we merge infrastructure for buyback and shit". Passed the post along!
---
[https://i.imgur.com/Macmzop.png](https://i.imgur.com/Macmzop.png)  
---
works better, is cheaper, has t2 scram, slightly less tank, but improved to solve a problem I don't have.
---
Three features:
---
1. White and gold plating, means it must be an Amarrian ship
---
2. Ludicrously tall; the only two ludicrously tall (and very short-length) Amarr hulls are the Oracle and the Apostle, and this thing is way too thick to be an Oracle
---
3. Those two little black dome features on the left wing. The Apostle is the only hull in the entire game to have those pairs of little domes on its wings
---
Granted, in order to know the third one, you would need to have spent some time looking at ships in EVE and appreciating their artistic design; but that's not really that bad of a thing to do, there's some really good looking ships in EVE (and the Apostle is one of them).
---
Until it's confirmed, I'm not going to believe claims of bots actually scanning down and running data and relic sites. That seems extremely sophisticated for a number of reasons.
---
Flair checks out
---
Nah it's possible, if you paid attention to Intel channels at the right times you'd notice the same names. Trying to hunt them would let you find their suspicious behavior.
---
Tbf, the current change also gives a huge advantage to defenders.
---
I mean just don't die and you won't need isk.
---
Part of this is engagement profile, part of it is just getting better at avoiding and getting the fights in way's you want them rather than letting your opponent dictate the fight, now really PVP doesn't take that much isk especially as you get better at it, you can generally fix the rest of the income needs with running PI on all your character slots ( ideally in a location that is somewhat good for PI ).
---
\&gt;unironically quoting shield recharge rate
---
At this point they have a lot more reasons then "just local" to quit over. The cyno change does nothing but add another level of tediousness to the game. Local was a snap decision that didn't achieve the goal of getting rid of bots nearly as well as they thought it would, the drifters event was a shit show, putting triglavian shit in highsec wasn't a bad idea until they put it in the way of new players just trying to do the opening mission arc repeatedly. All of this being a symptoms of Hilmar's sudden decision that only he can save eve by making as many random unannounced changes as possible as fast as he possibly can. When the CEO of a company suddenly decides to start telling his devs how to make the game work that he himself doesn't understand it sends a signal to players that things are only going to get worse until he stops doing that, and he's talking like that's not going to happen every time he gives an interview which just adds to the problem.
---
Why would a botter only run X highsec venture bots, when they could have run X+1 vni bots before?
---
Man you are fucking salty that your group is being exposed for the dumbasses they are lmfao
---
u/Harvey_Skywarker we need more sabres for the ammo tab ;)
---
oh, i see now
---
REEEEEEE MUH BLACKOUT MUST NOT BE TOUCHED REEEE
---
I can see running some scripts to automate certain behaviors alongside player interactions, but completely automating exploration seems highly sophisticated.
---
Re:
---
1,2,3. You know what happens when you assume?
---
4.Why wouldn’t have they n+1’d already to the extent possible, when botting revenue streams where better?
---
5.What is your point? 
---
6.If that where true I would see a wave of docking myrmidons when roaming null now instead of VNIs.

7.Yeah null is kind of empty, but so much of the activity previously was bots. Player-player content is easier to find when you don’t have to sift through player-bot content. And yes, ADMs are dropping without bot support (look at the Frat-TEST warzone), and yes I’d rather see a bot in a venture than a VNI or above.
---
8.Long live the Blackout!
---
How can you be so fucking stupid? You read what I wrote and quite literally came up with something I never discussed.  Did your mom try the bleach based cure for autism?
---
I've bene thinking about pi. But it's so complicated and I'm not even sure how to start... (we have some planet sin out wormhole system).
---
But I can't see the whole ship when it's docked, who cares if I know what ship it is?
---
EVE looter shooter. Calling it.
---
Those aren't actually that sophisticated
---
By "I haven't play the game for 1 year" I mean : "I did not spend 18h+ per day playing eve, using any free time to grind into this wonderful game, ready every god damn forum/reddit post to learn more about what's going on in eve within the last year" (and that's sad, I want to play eve but nothing motivate me to play it anymore)
---
Yeah I thought it was hard to believe too at first, but back in my GOTG days there was a few names that kept showing up. The people that hunted them swore up and down they were a bot, something about catching it in a site and the guy not doing anything.
---
Key-binding shortcuts
---
So you think T1 cloak is better than T2 cloak?
---
...
---
Yeah because you could totally feasibly hunt a Rorqual under an umbrella before blackout. :eyeroll:
---
What if they swapped high-sec for null. Then everyone would be on top of each other via jump ranges.
---
cHaOs!
---
The way I came out ahead on Somer was just whoring promo blinks as much as possible. I only played small regular blinks when necessary to be eligible for promos, and I never liquidated winnings into more credit, because that didn't give promo tokens. I always took the ship, sold it, and deposited isk as necessary. It wasn't gangbusters, it was like a free few hundred mil/week, but I do remember winning a carrier in a promo blink.
---
Bad bot

two days worth for skill urself (rip)

Because they are failing to understand the reasons people grouped up in the first place. They built the atmosphere they wanted, certain groups used the rules within that original atmosphere to become the top dogs and proceeded to shit all over most of the player base for close to 10 years, towards the end of that time the groups getting rolled decided to get together and make sure it never happened to them again. CCP is now attempting to shake the table and go back to that original atmosphere without realizing that will never work. The people that formed those large groups now know what they can do, they understand that staying together allows them to operate on a scale no one else can match. So the more CCP tries to force them to stop the more they will consolidate into larger and larger groups to prevent the changes damaging them or just outright quitting when they get tired of the devs targeting their playstyle. This is quite literally how you kill a game's player base, because sooner or later the people getting tired of being constantly targeted pick up their credit card and decide to go pay someone else to play their game. This isn't 2009 anymore, there are plenty of viable space combat and sim games to compete with CCP and we are coming up on the Fall/Winter game release cycle , this is the worst possible time to be incentivising your players to take a break from Eve.

I would guess that high-end Abyssal sites could garner enough isk to plex. This guide talks a bit about them, fits, isk/hr, etc...

Rookie ship cost nothing, any chance that target would be concorded instead = profit.
---
Honestly I was kind of surprised. I went in thinking it was going to be a very different kind of game but it is actually a pretty fun distilled eve experience. UI is alright though it took me a while to figure out how to get skills into my skill queue. I think a big problem with it is that even knowing all the terminology the UI was rather dense. However, I can see this solidifying into a good game rather well.
---
Side question. Is it possible to form a corp? I saw there were fleets but I didn't see an option to form a corp so me and other mates can fly around.
---
Hahahahaha you and your group are the same motherfuckers that sperg our about how nullsec players enjoy mindlessly killing structures, but now you juxtapose to enjoying structure killmails? Gtfo lmao
---
Why is it questionable?
---
Within hours Jita wasn't the trade hub, the tutorial hash you ship spin as the very first thing it teaches.
---
Overall it's showing some promise. The skills are condensed and tech levels determine what shios/modules you can use. 
---
Think "mastery of 3 lvl2 skills promotes you to lvl 3 technology."   
---
Then you need to master x lvl3 skills to unlock lvl4 technology.    
---
Etc.
---
Hey thanks for sharing this. I know from experience that solo wh life can be really fun and challenging. It’s good to have stories like this out there to inspire people to try it and make their own content.
---
lmao i've been part of sico for nearly 5 years now, can confirm I'm not a botter. Get more evidence pls thx. Been there since the first 50 dudes :p
---
Yeah, I imagine doing anything 18h+ a day would burn you out - even with Meth.  
---
Balance is key.
---
&gt;That whole group, SEADC in particular, something has always been off/shady. I've spoken to their CEO/alliance head a number of times and something's not right about them. Frat and frat pet alliances have let these guys into winter co a number of times. 90%+ of of them are inactive. they spam the sh*t out of everyone (as mentioned) then give the newer players an awful experience and they quit the game. It's too bad and hurts all of us. If there were more honest groups out there to help newbros I think we'd have much better player retention (and providing CCP gets out of their own way).
---
Feeder training/highsec corp for a few different corps. They have several fcs and will throw ships at lowsec and nullsec, teach newbs the ropes of fleets, do bomber drops in Delve. 
---
It's my old corp before I got tired of the noobs and joined with some wormholers. None of us or them pretend to be anything cool or great or good at the game.
---
By a lot. Those 36 dreads don't pay one titan.
---
It shouldn't need a new module, the existing inhib should shut down active cynos in its range. And it should be smaller, cheaper and re-scoopable like an MTU or a deployable bubble.
---
However, since CCP apparently want to do low effort changes and that's actually a feature, it's better to have cynos nerfed than not.
---
... The same way they fly supercarriers
---
Dumbass
---
Because VNI bots are more noticeable and easier to detect, plus overhead of maintaining VNI stock from deaths could potentially result in logistics and cash reserve issues.
---
It is just under the average eve players lose in the month of August.
---
Didn't want to have someone make me think I was missing a 'feature'.
---
Why make it harder to krab though? That just means there are less mindless targets to kill... I just don’t understand this logic at all.
---
Said no one ever
---
Like your write up, you basically described what I do as well, solo c5 life fits how much I can play.  Everyone but me left so just kept rolling.  Live in J(redacted).
---
**A R T**
---
They weren't actually active botters, but ones already banned.
---
Who knows what they were actually botting in, CCP probably just grabbed the most expensive ship they owned.
---
Teaching kids that it is ok to scamm others?
---
Completely different mechanics....dumbass
---
Oh so not a companion app to Eve Online, but a mobile spinoff in same setting?
---
Not the best choice, as you will be limited to 3/10 and 4/10, but sure. Check out the [list](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites#DED_rated_complexes) of deds here.
---
T1 cloaked ships don't get caught either.  T2 doesn't help that much for what we do.  We need maximum tank for optimal price.  This was the solution we came up with.  It has worked well for a very long time.  Dropping 13% of our tank to solve a problem we don't have isn't very helpful.  
---
If a fleet is on you, you want maximum tank.   Honestly, we're more likely to put a DCU if we're doing the smaller shields.  
---
Either way, time to let it go.
---
well if they want to dramastically change the economy the ability of killing npc structure and get some loot probably gonna have a massive impact  
---
dunno if it's for the better or worse Tapirium probably gonna invade HS just like pandafam or share the cake idk but that certainly gonna change everything
---
Isnt that what inner hell does...
---
That’s it? Can I get an actual response? Some discourse here bud?
---
Too long, didn't read.
---
How big is your epeen?
---
CantStandYa
---
They most certainly had the right idea and they still have.  
---
Unlike WOW and MC, they have a bad product though.
---
Why do you think T1 cloak is better?
---
No? I kind of like everything I've ever done in this game. I don't see the appeal of showing up in a fleet that's so big that the defender can't possibly fight it, but I have zero issues with sov or structure fights (or roaming or ls plex fights or WH brawls or ganking or etc.).
---
stop teasing us plz!
---
A Smokescreen covert ops cloak allowed for any ship to warp while cloaked in the era of targeted doomsdays? That actually existed on TQ?
---
Nah no local is a good thing but they seriously need to implement a constalation/region "sov ihub"  or any other "objective" roamers can attack and get their content that way, hunt some VNI and other shit isn't fun anyway
---
Nah, I might change my mind. You never know
---
I too have been apart of SEADC in one form or another for 3 years. If there is bots here, they suck at it. Was SEADC before starting my own Corp in low sec. We take SEADC bros and yeet into poorly planned engagements for the lulz. We are E L I T E.
---
Hello this is a great write-up and very informative for someone like me with no knowledge of wormhole space. I only have one question.
---
&gt; More like “yeah, you’re mad that we exist, so what.” xd
---
ya no
---
The Mittani was angry that day, my friends.
---
So if it is "bots" in null sec make multiple threads a day on reddit.
---
If it is bots in high sec stfu dont say shit on reddit and tell ccp got it.
---
Pm me on jabber
---
My 10 year old daughter has already been banned on roblox for scamming,not sure if i should be proud or not lmfao
---
neither were they necessarily banned for botting, some people there didn't get banned for botting.
---
Here we go again!
---
So why didn´t they make/run more bots in null?
---
I bet the number of bots didn´t significantly change. If they had the hardware to run X amount of bots, they sure as hell ran X amount of bots. Now they came to HS where their activity is way more obvious then it was in some random deep null pockets.
---
This is a good change in my point of view. 
---
Let´s be honest, blackout affected your risk/reward in null, and you don´t like it, now you are looking for some arguments that would lead to the end of blackout.
---
Regarding PCU, let´s wait and see how it turns out over a longer period. PCU doesn´t show us the amount of Omega Accounts. And people claiming to have unsubbed X amount of accounts is not hard facts/data. 
---
And what the hell does "A majority" mean? Using that term just shows that you made up that claim. Show me "a" majority which claimed that bots are gone from the game now. There might have been a few people who claimed that.
---
But yeah let´s call other people who don´t agree with you delusional! :)
---
Yup, that's exactly what I'm saying.  Which is definitely a component of why I don't like the present change.
---
You can say alot about pl at this state in  their life but people will probably remember them until the server get shut down.
---
Oh hey a Coloradan!
---
Bots will just not have structures in their alliance so it doesnt affect bots just legitimate players. If I understand correctly high sec is intended to be a safer space for players to experiment with some of the mechanics and or watch their imaginary space dollars go up very slowly. A high sec blackout would basically turn high sec into npc null for citadel owning corps as long as people are willing to pay for wardecs
---
Edit: but without the increased rewards of npc null.
---
o7
---
Make benign shit seem grandiose? Yea
---
In op's defense they _are_ expecting a ban, so that might be a life lesson
---
Doesn't greater society and Capitalism already support that?
---
Yes, I lost a chremoas to those pesky beam algoses. Please reimburse
---
Attack me personally since you have nothing to respond. Classic
---
Ah ok. Well I don't have the skills or isk to afford losing a 500mil-1bil shop in combat lol. So I guess that might have to do
---
then that's just, like, your playstyle man
---
lmao.
---
Blackout 2.0: just pull the fucking plug already.
---
It feels like eve. If it was on PC I would propably play it/test it a lot more then I am. It just doesn't feel like a mobile game at all. Maybe on Emulators it could be good idk....
---
The eve equlivent of a safeword. Gotta love it.
---
There is also tutorial it teaches you how to spin your ship; then ends. The alpha is only playable by existing eve players otherwise you have 0 guidance. 
---
Goto the encounters screen, pick a mission and go do it. They range from 1 to 30 jumps away, currently no way to sort, so check first.
---
Or go mine
---
tbh, most of the supported smartphones have hardware that would classify as a decent laptop
---
Is anyone actually surprised by this type of thing? If there is any kind of marketable item there will be farmers.
---
no that's two s-stilettos
---
way to give yourself up as someone who has absolutely no experience hunting rorquals lmao they were dying an average 10+ a day pre-blackout
---
Hopefully, it'll be a PC first game. And with good VR support.
---
Seems to be right on point.
---
\*sigh\*
---
&gt; *Criticizes OP about logic and makes a rape-therapy meme joke.*

Is this for real?

This has to be satire, yes?
---
I decided to stay -because- my boat was popped in my first hour, not despite of it.
---
You misspelt Excavators. 
---
1000s of Super Pilots are no problem, if there are only a few supers to be piloted by them.
---
People in game are great, r/Eve is a wasteland of memes and shitposts.
---
No. Sadly
---
Nope. Just like your shiphull doesn´t get affected by damage (unless it hits 0%).
---
Do we jump?
---
Should we jump now?
---
Is it time to jump?
---
FC? Wut do?
---
I'll have you know we are pretty good at thrusting our pelves.
---
Also if you open the overview one of the options has a celestial signatures, that will show ore belts and pirate bases
---
Yes - trading (sky is the limit, but you need seed money), incursions (80m/hr = 25 hours), abyssal (5-250m/hr , realistic for you 80m/hr = 25 hours), scamming, PI, and missions 
---
Keep them - with alphas, consider 5m to be the new base xp since you can train up to that free
---
PI helps with isk but is painfully boring. Cap alt eventually. Trading alts are good if you do regional trading. Industry but I know nothing about that. Support for pvp (bubbles, boosh, etc). But you don’t really need alts for the style you want to start with. 
---
Try 2-3 man frigate abyssal sites. It’s probably the best isk for high sec atm besides scamming or trading. And you can slowly progress. And it’s not as boring as missions. 
---
Since I took the time to answer this, do me (and yourself) a favor and try some pvp too. Buy some cheap ships and go on a roam with your friends. I’ll even FC for you if you give it a shot. IGN: Fisher Kel
---
&gt;I imagine doing anything 18h+ a day would burn you out
---
WoW kept me interested for years before it let me down with WoD, eve let kept me interested for years before they made the area where  big coalition fight each other small gang friendly (until you cry about blackout, I'm talking about citadel/fozzie)
---
No. Not at all. Unless the damage is 100%
---
[hrnnnnnggg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pXfHLUlZf4)
---
I’ve heard this too, but I’ve also seen them die. Do it at your own risk... maybe start w no bastion to test tank. Also, if groups did it, it wouldn’t be solo...
---
Check zkill for losses from trig rats outside of abyssal space. That will show you fits that don’t work.
---
Apparently exploration bots exist, which is pretty impressive.
---
Blops wasn’t shit before blackout, just niche. It’s now less shit and less niche, but still niche.
---
&gt; And I dont wanna be that guy but honestly, if all the small gangs would vanish this very instant it wouldnt make much difference.
---
It would kill of one of the playergroups with one of the highest amounts of accounts per person and the highest engagement ratings (in terms of economics) per player.
---
&gt;  What do they do thats so awesome for the game?
---
They´re pretty much the only place left for people that favour initiative and skill based PvP content and are historically a breading ground for future large scale content creators. Many FCs have started as small scalers and solo PvPers. Back in the day these environments were generated partly by null alliances going at each others throats and diverse and vibrant null politics. Even plenty of small scale people were flying with null alliances or were skirmishing under their banners. But since the null empires became such snuggly and artificial constructs and (super)caps became the be all end all of PvP many of them moved on to fight these alliances or quit the game because of constant neglectance of anything that would further support their playstyle by CCP (lowsec, NPC null, FW space, subcap viability). 
---
Most of them would probably be pretty happy with not having to travel 40 jumps into nullsec before tackling an afk VNI in the hopes that someone fucks up so they get a fight. I remember times where you could roam through low or NPC null and get a fight for 5-10 people around every corner. 
---
That´s why many of them went to WH space to actually keep that playstyle somewhat viable by cycling through regions of space instead of having to roam for hours. 
---
Another factor here are the aggressive recruitment campaigns of large null blocs that dragged a lot of new players into dependency and careers with onedimensional skillsets, reducing the amount of fresh blood needed for more self-sufficient playstyles. 
---
The sad turth is there is little left to fight for these guys besides large nullblocs that will ofc drop the hammer on anything that moves into their vicinity, hence forcing them into kitey bullshit or cloaky cancer while having to run 90% of the time when shit actually goes down. 
---
 Under these circumstances quotes like 
---
&gt; Promoting that playstyle, like CCP has always done
---
are obviously complete and utter nonsense. Small to Medscale content has been eating shit for at least 6-7 years now. Starting with things like the removal of static plexes in lowsec, over making capitals viable anti-subcap platforms to utterly neglecting lowsec and NPC space as the breading grounds for small scale content and changes that made ubiqitous small scale in null pretty much non existent besides some entry system gate camp fuckery.
---
&gt; Im saying that if you dont work, you dont eat
---
Now that´s the thing that causes the most animosities because even though the combined efforts of every small gang group could never reach the combined efforts of a nullsec power house the effort on a personal level to maintain that playstyle is a magnitude higher than that of the average nullbloc member. Being a grunt is as easy and carefree as it gets. 
---
You say: Why should a a bunch of tryhards be able to kill me when i want to rat for an hour. The combined effort of 1000s of players should make this impossible. 
---
They say: Why should that lazy cunt that does jack shit on his own be immune to me killing him when i myself invest countless hours to even find that dude and then some to actually have something to fight him with? 
---
&gt; Eve is supposed to be hardcore right?
---
There is actually little else that is more hardcore than self-reliant solo/small scale PvP, especially on a dedicated and competitive level without PLEX injection. That´s why these people burn out like firecrackers on a regular basis. I love that playstyle but i can never comit to it for longer periods before taking breaks in more chill environments. 
---
&gt; If small gangs want content then CCP should make an expansion that allows them to fight other small gangs, not nerf the defense networks that are kept in place by hundreds if not thousands of players costing trillions of isk and countless manhours.
---
Correct. On the other hand what do you need those defense networks for because there is literally noone left to challenge them in the current state of null and with the current PvP meta. 
---
&gt; But here, due to CCP employees personal bias its considered as "gamebreaking" if they dont get more advantages.
---
Anything CCP has done was the complete opposite in the past half decade. That´s why you now have to deal with the remains of a starved out, highly skilled group of PvPers that is used to fighting asymetrical engagements, frothing at the mouth like rabid dogs. And frothing at the mouth they are. Because in their eyes (directly and indirectly) the large null blocs are at least jointly responsible for the desolate state of the game anywhere outside of their spheres of influence. While they could have done that in any point in time in the past -with or without blackout- there was no need for them to do so. 
---
That´s another thing that hasn´t reached a lot of the players in their large nullsec filter bubbles yet: The game has become a barren wasteland even compared to just 1 or 2 years ago where the player drain really kicked in and people who were not interested in the nullbloc playstyle started leaving in droves. In many places it´s already way below what i would consider critical mass or salvagable while you still think everything was gucci before the blackout. It wasn´t. Not at all. People were saying this for years. But they got told to adapt or die and that eve was dying since 2003 by at that point i time the minority that were nullbloc players. I too remember the 20% statistic. Why do you think has it risen to 40% when the player numbers have been in constant decline for years? It´s not growth, i can tell you that much. Now think about that the majority of players still lives in highsec. That should give you a rough idea about the state of the game outside of Goon-,Test-, or GoTG-space.
---
Ownership of space isn’t intel. There are easy public sources for that.
---
I'll be opening a betting pool for how long until this is canceled, buy in early!
---
Great job putting this up, love to hear the passion of an energetic solo pilot.
---
Couple learning opportunities for you:
---
* Modules have escalating (almost exponential iirc) heat damage as the rack retains heat while you overheat your mods constantly, and because modules that are OH propagate damage through the rack. While you heat, look at the three gauges above your cap but below your shield/armor/structure. Those bars are the heat retention/level in your respective h/m/l racks. The higher that gauge, the greater the heat damage your modules are taking. This is why you could be at like 80-85% heat damage taking 7% damage per cycle on a module, and then it suddenly breaks on the next cycle. I've snapped mods from as low as 70% heat on the next cycle, so you need to watch not just the damage, but the rate of damage and how much of an inferno you've turned your rack into. This is especially important on your stabber fit, as you are always needing to heat your ASB, so quitting heat earlier rather than later is safer. Getting your Thermodynamics skill up has a SIGNIFICANT effect, so consider bringing that skill to 5 as a higher priority.
---
* If you look closely at the damage notifications you have coming up through the centre of your screen, you'll see that each damage notification also tells you what afflicted that damage. So for example, while fighting the omen and punisher, you said you werent sure what weapons were on the punisher and that it could be ac's. If you looked at the notifications, you'd have seen that he was using Dual Light Pulses, and therefore confirmed he was laser fit. This would also have been significant during the Vexor fight, as you would have seen damage notifications from Ogre heavy drones, confirming he was doing the 2/2/1 drone layout.
---
* For your lowsec AB fit, consider a nanofiber or meta TE if you have the cpu for it. Overdrives only give you benefit in top speed, which while on paper is a nice idea, is less useful than say a nanofiber. The agility and mass reduction on a nano means you'll be able to dictate range and transversal more quickly, as well as allowing you to react to say like ammo changes from your opponent. It also can let you be more efficient when you do start manual piloting (:P), as you can shift your vector more quickly, thus exerting greater control on the engagement.
---
* Concerning getting under cruiser guns, for lasers you absolutely want to try to get under their guns rather than dictate at range. They have pretty terrible tracking, even when webbing their target. So if you had gone for a say 500-1000m close orbit on the Omens, you'd have seen a definite mitigation of their damage. For the Rupture, getting closer under guns is generally a better option if theyre using 425s, and maybe 220s. Use the damage notifications in your videos to review that decision on those fights, and check them during fights in the future. :)
---
* During your stabber fight, when a fight is so pinned on cap warfare such as that, consider not using specific mods if they wont make a significant difference. Considering that you're basically mirror fit, by turning off your ab you would have conserved significant cap comparatively, without impacting your dps in the fight (because you two are identical). If you do so, and someone starts to flee or say swap to barrage and move to 9km, just turn your own AB on. In that fight, it would have meant the difference between both of you capping out, and instead you'd have won the cap war.
---
* In most fights, except frigate fights, I tend to choose to be more zoomed out than zoomed in. This lets me see more of whats developing around me, and more immediately notice changes in my enemy's movements. However while brawling and trying to setup your dictation, being zoomed in is important. Another idea is to instead 'look at' your opponents ship to see how they are trying to manuever and simply react with hot keys and manual piloting.
---
* As others have said, get on them hot keys. I use the standard F1-12 keys as the client's default, and just changed how to reach my mid/lows with different combinations of [key]-F1-12. My hand doesnt move as much, and its a motion i am used to, so I can react pretty quickly. You can also preset keys to turn heat on and off not just the rack, but individual modules. With this you can preheat easier, and instantly stop your heat rather than needing to mouse over it. You can set drone hot keys as well, and I just drag drop them into space to deploy them.
---
Good luck out there though, and maybe someday we'll spar :D
---
You join a real wormhole Corp, then check pathfinder for one someone else mapped. ;)
---
Oh I was thinking Sansha not trig
---
Thanks, guys, is there a specific ship that is better for solo? I heard Sin was the best, however, I am really close to having decent skills for a Redeemer.  Thanks again!
---
any faction capital that is stuck on grid due to module (siege/triage/nsa) will be shit because you're gonna get tackled and be primary.
---
the point of the factional capital is to dick swing and provide dank content, nothing more.
---
how is a VNI bot more noticeable and easier to detect than any other bot?
---
K. 
---
*drops carrier on a random hecate*
---
Daytripping WH bots? Great, they can run C1 or C2 sites, which make no money, or C3 sites and make some money but be at risk of getting ganked by the inhabitants/people in the chain/other people dipping their toe in.
---
The good money in WHs is C5/6 space, and they rarely ever open directly to highsec.  A bot (with 2-3 accounts realistically to run a C5 without some ridiculous and inefficient rattlesnake fit) probing its way aimlessly into high class WH space, running sites, then probing its way out without dying so frequently as to offset the potential gains would be a sight to behold.  I’ll believe in daytripping bots when I see evidence for them. Wormholer btw.
---
What’s the name of the subreddit where they misunderstand /r/eve post titles?
---
I knew it was you before reading the username. I love your videos, and I really liked the one where you scammed that provi ceo for fake spy names. You've got moves.
---
This comment is really on point. I joined null a couple months back and watching your videos I decided my goal was to stop mining for ISK and find a group to do PvP with. I'm having a hard time finding a small group though. Being totally ignorant, I wanted to leave hi sec really bad and I joined a big bloc and now I'm in an alliance where most people don't interact or even know each other. This isn't where I want to be. 
---
How do I escape, John? Where to? 
---
By the way, can't wait for your next video
---
I think your mother dropped your stupid ass on your head when you were young
---
You really need to find PVE that is doable to sustain the PVP you want to do. The unfortunate reality is that Eve has a cost to it, both in-game and out.
---
IF you do PVP to fund PVP, your PVP will suffer. Unless, of course, you get really lucky in doing PVP.
---
The only real option for profitable PVP is baiting BLOPs/Cap drops or just regular ganks while doing a PVE activity in LS/NS. This lets you PVE and also bait out some PVP. However, that's not perfect and you could realistically go days without getting a bite.
---
Frigate PVP is easy to fund with Exploration in NS/LS/C1-3.
---
Get lucky with that for a while and you can fund higher level PVP.
---
Cruiser PVP is possible as well, even BC, depending.

If you want to PVP and gank people in a blingy T3, you really need a steady income source like WHs or NS/LS ratting.
---
The only way to really fund PVP with hardly any PVE, is to Market PVP and corner a part of the market that makes bank for you. You need Trade skills on a Trade Alt, but don't have to manufacture or mine a thing. Just buy low and sell high, move things between stations/regions.
---
This is boring and I don't do it, but can be more passive. Upkeep on orders and management can be tedious however.
---
I PVE to fund PVP, because at least that is actively shooting things and I enjoy that part of the game. PI is a passive source and really good in WHs, if you want to go that route.
---
I have not been in NS in over a decade, so maybe someone from there can weigh-in. For my part, I would suggest using WHs to make ISK in a WH Corp, find PVP which is abundant, and utilize PI across several characters.
---
So, Planetside 3?  SOE/DBG can rest easy.
---
It's a few. They'll be gone before you know it as well
---
*laughs in Komodo*
---
On average,about how long do you play in a given day?
---
Why are you telling me your cupsize? 
---
Maybe try r/aBraThatFits if you need a new manzierre.
---
Is it connected to the real Eve? Or is this some extra universe with no meaning for us?
---
*It feels like the very first time*
---
I laughed far too hard at my office desk for comfort... Bravo...
---
Honestly, it was just great to see you and jeffraider and a bunch of people out in Space again having fun in kikis.

---
Not complicated at all, just tedious.
---
Wormholes would look better if they were bigger.
---
I don't insure anything unless I'm very sure it'll die the next time it undocks.
---
Dwarf fortress at least allows you to pause lol
---
been there done that
---
Like most other simulators?
---
Only if you wrongly assume the premise that people can't criticize people on their side of the aisle.
---
Yea, while everybody else is bitching up a storm, we are loving it
---
Maybe this will be part of system control for FW that will make control relevant again.  Not docking in NPC stations is not a big deal.
---
Null is safe because you and 20,000 other dudes can fight together to protect yourselves
---
Wohmoles are safe because you can fucking live in them solo
---
lol You asked for examples, you must be TrIgGeReD, sNoWfLaKe.
---
I bet if you look, theres at least one goon thread a day about the blackout
---
System please. 
---
Jk thanks for the cool write up
---
Wheeeelllll ahoy there, you're not alone in the north! Now you'll have to watch for idiots waving wildly at you
---
dont jump in to a black hole...you will never see him again
---
Haha good to know! Join the eve 303 discord or pm me if you would like to grab drinks or something
---
Key words: "(Angel Capital ships) aren't being planned for any time soon"
---
Probably not a life lesson, my kids already have alts. Their prepared for the banhammer.
---
Eve is failcascading. Who cares. They can’t even pay to keep their local chat online
---
On the bright side, you will travel insanely fast and scan bonus is helpful.
---
Omaha!
---
Indeed it is. Although, it may also be chaos.
---
I'd say it's in the smaller end of full 3d mobile games. Dragalia/Azur Lane/Kings Raid/Shadowverse/Fire emblem heroes/Pubg are all well over 2 gigs and that's just on my phone off the top of my head. Pretty sure ragnarock m is over 5gb. Shits huge these days.
---
&lt;dusts off Sega Genesis&gt;
---
I signed up, but I have an iPhone 5. Can I get an F?
---
Ok doomchinchilla, just because u apparently still don’t understand the rorqual changes doesn’t mean u need to come over here and start crying about the end of Eve and how no one is going to play eve. Just shut up and go back to your spreadsheets.
---
Sorry about that
---
Yuge
---
It’ll be alright somehow. *nervous sweats* we’ll still manage to mine our spod
---
Total lies from Putin Pets.
---
The truth is this eviction was paid for by someone the beans had evicted.   He paid 40b to TownsFolk to unfit all the stations and he paid 120B to InnerHell for the eviction.   
---
Kara Korbrey is a lie machine, or as they say in russia "If you don't deceive, you can't sell" Мочи перхоти
---
It also helps to learn how not to get scammed yourself and lets them grasp the metagame. Beats teaching kids to be holy paladins imo.
