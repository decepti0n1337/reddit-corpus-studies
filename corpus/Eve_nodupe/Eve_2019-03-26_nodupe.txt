haha horde should just keep the pirat dec mutual and do this all the time
---
link your pirat/marmite main
---
How much do you pay me for not evicting you ?
---
yea? its your highest offer right now bucko
---
Thanks. It’s always annoying when I click on an older twitch link and it takes me somewhere completely unrelated 
---
The low-karma anon heckles from the peanut gallery? Painting all of us with the same brush won't get you very far. INIT. in particular seem to have a raging hate boner for PIRAT. My personal affinity stems from being a highsec ganker and a follower of James 315.
---
Beautiful post.

haha beautiful pic
---
I love the new Attrributes tab layout, so much nicer than the grid key + value list.
---
Nicely done! Congrats! 
---
Your ship color compliments the corpse quite nicely.
---
You may not be an expert PVPer but I can tell you're an experienced photographer. That's some damn good staging!
---
Congrats, you've just made every rorq switch to regular mining drones and even less risk of loss, ccp should hire you.
---
You also should, just once, set a ping in the middle of a star. Pretty awesome scenery.
---
&gt;30 titans
---
Your first problem is doing anything in lowsec near snuff.
---
I watched a few dreads and carriers from FW fighting on station yesterday and snuff came and dropped like 10 titans. 
---
I had it happen once. Fortunately I wasn't scrammed yet and managed to get out (partly because the Strat screwed up and decloaked too soon).
---
They fixed that bug :(
---
It'll take them what, two hours to reprogram their bots to do this perfectly every time? Meanwhile the non-botting players will be punished by more cancerous gameplay.
---
First kill in an Astero?
---
Pilot Cragcrag, you are a bold one.
---
Well shoot. Chat still doesn't work but #FixingTheImportantStuff
---
I can see using it so you don’t have to worry about those campers in solo asteros, or other stratioses. 
---
Very tempting, I only live down the road
---
Well I have to thank Horde for protecting the undock from pirates cause now I can finally move shit there without a bunch of people stroking themselves over killing another hauler.
---
nice work
---
As mentioned few groups bump into then  the. 
---
We (hidden baguette) eat shit on their set up (we are in a c4 so we could not get caps through it,
---
Then couple days later Nobody In local find them and managed to get those guys down after a 2h fight with 3 dread on their side (the nag tanked 20m damage) 
---
So when they found them again no wonder they batphone to secure the kill :)
---
elite_pvper_wants_to_know_your_location.meme
---
in fairness, when we started they were busy dicking over test supers
---
hahahahahahahahaha
---
Legit, you can't bring capitals or bhaals so you're forced to grind through them with raw dps. Because the tank on triage is so fucking absurd you're forced to bring 80+ dps. It's shitty, but that's game mechanics. 
---
I replied to someone else's comment about your kill board. Then *you* sperg at me about  the greater issues at hand. I didn't even say you were bad at PvP, just mediocre at solo from a KB standpoint. You're getting hot over nothing, especially since this comment thread **wasn't about the content of your post.**
---
Had a great fight! My first capital fight since I've returned to the game. You blapped my alt sabre near the end. And his pod got away with 5% structure lol.
---
Note: Don't be a noob, when you're flying a sabre keep transversal up or else the nag with 1-shot you. Your video showed that you even had transversal sorted so you usually blapped stuff pretty quick, so this helped me a lot :)
---
2:00 tbh, glad I started at 1:44 tho &lt;3
---
PR like this makes me wanting to join Inner Hell. Keep up the good work boys !!!
---
Just my 2 cents:
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1. The Ram-jag is definitely a little too powerful. I think nerfing powergrid is not the way to go since it causes issues for solo and small gang fits. I think the way to go is to increase the sig and decrease the speed. Now I'm slightly biased here since I fly mostly small gang and solo and I also have a die hard love for the Harbinger which is essentially turbocucked as soon as a ram jag is on field.
---
2. Having a limit on ancillary booster should **not** be done as you need 2 in order to have a decent 'active tank' and this is essentially a requirement as regular t2 boosters are completely useless. Armor tanks are quite effective with dual t2 reps but shields have no reasonable cheap active tank options, it's either dual ancil or deadspace. If you want a limit, you need to buff t2 boosters.
---
Basketball shorts are really comfy on a basketball court and while enjoying the game vicariously at home. Not a problem with those at all.
---
I also imagine it would be possible to have a pod-couture, that which is worn inside the pod. Another thing CCP could sell as a non-pay-to-win option.
---
For practical purposes, I really would go into the pod naked. You’re in the liquid, it’s the right temperature. Having a pair of trunks on would become really uncomfortable after a while, or so I imagine.
---
As far as I know PI is completely off limits to Alphas.
---
How much kool-aid did you drink to think hk didn't live there 
---
Not hot just saying it's irrelevant.
---
Hek V-Moon 1. That’s where it’s happening. Thanks for everyone who helped. 
---
It’s at Hek V moon 1. And it’s still happening
---
Nothing. Not everything I posted was a bad thing.
---
I mean it's not like Horde has 72 times more pilots that Pirat.
---
Is this in the launcher or in the browser? If it's the browser, try a different one. If it's the launcher, try disabling 2FA temporarily. 
---
Its in the browser. I tried using IE instead of Firefox Nightly, but the same problem came up. Thanks for your help though!
---
Yet I t’s still possible for Snuff to lose an ISK war against a small number of people, when those people are flying bling-ish dreads and know what they’re doing. (I’m talking about Plex Me Now, which looks to be only two or three people...?) https://br.inyour.space/?s=45346&amp;b=8523360&amp;e=90&amp;t=yDvvve
---
maybe dont decc them?
---
great vid, where is the music from?
---
How many other corpse traders out there are there? I thought it was just me
---
yes pls, do they have any need for a no-skill-deadbeat then it be great for me
---
Really? I read that Alphas get a single planet, albeit its super limited since you cant upgrade the command base
---
Thank you! ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
---
Perhaps the "forgot password" link. Although it's not working for me right now.
---
I thought of trying that out earlier but got worried it would flag me for something. Ill try it out. Thanks so much!
---
Brings a Fax... whines about small gang traditions.  SMH.  Good fight dude but no need to be salty.
---
Interesting if true. I can't speak to your subjective "worth it" question but I will say your earning potential from a single non-upgraded planet would be miniscule.
---
Pirat doesn't have broad support among Goons. Some support Pirat, others don't. Most don't care.
---
I don't think any of the Goon CSM representatives support Pirat, if that matters.
---
Well that sucks. Guess I'll put even more ISK into station trading
---
It'll start the [account recovery](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/204217361-Account-Recovery) process. Failing that you can email support@eveonline.com. Good luck!
---
You think your shitpost encourages the Chinese.people to overthrow their government? I would say it's quite the opposite. It's people like you that provoke nationalism within the Chinese community
---
Did you just use a pedophile apologist as a stand in for Pirat with that analogy? 
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

---
However, that Jag can't kill what it is tackling
---
No doubt great piloting but am i the only one that things dreads should not be that oppresive towards subcaps? 
---
It's just a tackle fit Jaguar
---
This is already an absurd amount of effort to do especially with multiple Rorqs, and since mobile depots are personal, that means they need to be either anchored by the Rorq flying back and forth over the small distance or being positioned by a ship ahead of time and positioning the Rorq for every cluster of rocks.
---
Especially with the tank and panic duration nerfs which bring them much more vulnerability, it seems like something that's okay to me to let be that as a reward for that amount of preparation and sacrifice of time actually mining.
---
Demanding even more when the nerf hasn't even dropped really just feels like whining on the part of people who simply wish for big loot and easy ganks without rising to the challenge of having hard targets to kill.
---
It'd be fun if you could get them to rage quit the game.
---
damn dude, this is really cool thanks so much!
---
The top one means you haven't trained any levels.  The bottom one means you trained 5 levels.
---
Yeah so it is possible to hunt these beasts with considerable effort put in. I am actually an opponent of the constant nerfs against Rorquals and supers because I think there are ways to kill them. 
---
Go forth, my wormbro. 
---
Go forth and *wreck their shit.*
---
And while we are at it please remove shields and armor from Rorquals as well so even the dumbest idiot can kill them with his 5 isk shit fit ship
---
I miss durr...
---
&gt;Demanding even more when the nerf hasn't even dropped really just feels like whining on the part of people who simply wish for big loot and easy ganks without rising to the challenge of having even moderately hard targets to kill.
---
Surely the upstanding elite dvd citizens of r/eve would never do such a thing. 
---
World War Pee
---
It's not pvp lol, if it is it's pvp, than it's pvp for cucks. It's honestly sad that they enjoy that shit. I look forward to CCP continuing to fuck their playstyle into oblivion.  
---
Congrats and well done.
---
You guys keep "suggesting" things...meanwhile in Iceland, CCP couldn't even be assed to designate a block of time to even just TALK about LS/FW at the CSM Summit. 
---
What is it gonna take for you guy to realize they have abandoned you? Talk with your wallets already...
---
Maybe the fact that people have 8-10 rorqs is the problem?.. 
---
I'm returning to see how things are, I'm honestly wondering why they haven't tried to make it cross platform yet onto Android. Dedicated PC players are being replaced by more mobile users. 
---
i did indeed bro, in the sense that it's something everyone already agrees they hate, a non-issue brought up just to incite a circle jerk confirmation bias session
---
Seems numbers were pretty even, why didn't LSH reship to something brawly. Seems dumb to engage in an inferior sniping comp.
---
Seriously?
---
Just carry a small mining ship with the Wetu's in your cargo-hold and eject from the rorqual to anchor your wetu's. Ez.
---
Also, what system you mining in bro? I could use some boosts &amp; friends. 
---
&gt; they enjoy that shit
---
Here's a little hint, just like everyone else in this game. Salty players fuel them, not the content itself. 
---
Being a predictable little salty cuckold makes mining the salt that much easier. 
---
Yes.
---
Moons do not work that way, you gotta move. 
---
He's pointing to the awfully wrong spacing between the squares and the different sized dots mate.
---
Do it! 
---
Been playing eve on and off since 2012. I too got my first real solo kill in an Astero (killed a heron too). Dude put a 100 mill bounty on me and then I proceeded to give him tips and recruited him into my alliance. Eve is cool 
---
The first of many I'm sure! Congrats and stay off my lawn!
---
It's a fleet composition centered around a small number of Ewar focused battleships, a Vindicator with super-strength webs, with optional Bhaalgorn attached for added cap pressure. It's basically one of the few situations where you can be this oppressive against subcaps with just a pair of dreads, and there are still a lot of ways to play around it. It just so happens to be that blap dread comps like this are very effective against the initial heavy armor comp that Of Sound Mind brought. 
---
No
---
Dock up, go to the market button. Search afterburner, buy it and fit it on the ship fitting screen.
---
God the music in this video is absolutely perfect. Does anybody know what these songs are called?
---
Sweet so I find a cheap one nearby and make an offer for market price?
---
I'd also check the redeem items window. Click the Hamburger Menu (The 3 horizontal lines upper left of screen) &gt;&gt;&gt; Inventory &gt;&gt;&gt; Redeem Items and see if maybe it had a tutorial to reclaim an afterburner when in station.
---
yes, if you are near a major trade hub, or a rookie system they will be on market
---
muninns btw
---
Hmm zero items to redeem.
---
Scroll to the bottom youll first see them on the right side on the russian side. the ?'s are where the ship should be
---
I'm nothing if not stubborn. 
---
No, we dont need to farther nerf armor caps with another useless low slot module. 
---
Still haven’t got a solo kill yet, either I die first or I let them escape because I forget that I have drones in a drone ship.
---
As shown by the now-removed feature of walking-in-stations, capsuleers do not spend 100% of their time in their pods. I'd imagine even that far in the future our tribe of hairless apes would mostly not have shaken their want to wear clothing, so swim trunks make sense if someone were to spot you entering/exiting your pod.
---
That sheet is 🔥 
---
&gt; Do you think it makes sense to simply limit them as a max as 1 per ship instead?
---
don't you fucking dare touch my gimmick dual ASB fits
---
just remove the jaguar's rep bonus and some other things
---
Weren’t you just arrested?
---
yeah saw it was reping him lol and many more just  was a lot of dps on the field
---
I may be down for that. Probably on the later side of the night. 
---
Code is worse. Pff
---
It’s definitely something I want to try, maybe I wil this coming weekend when I hopefully have a bit more saved from just doing some basic mission running and getting my skills up, I’ll take a look at some skill paths to to train up to get me better prepared for this. Thanks!
---
1. You’re the elite of the elite
---
2. That means you get to have your personal decanter facility at the location where the ship is docked
---
3. No ship is so small that you couldn’t have what then passes for a suitcase along for the ride
---
4. When entering the pod you’re in the chamber where the pod is stored [it looked different in CQ, I know], you disrobe, store your clothes in your suit case and connect to the ship’s control features in the pod
---
The decanter room, ideally, would have food and drink waiting for the pilot, as well as a shower. While the rest of the crew handle’s the ship’s systems, the pilot decants and prepares to go through the rest of their day. In fantastic luxury, of course.
---
"manage to keep tackle"
---
Ya, it's pretty insane you all kept tackle as long as you did while bat phoning.
---
cause oh noes they might lose fights?
---
As i remember  noone from TEST leave  yes was impresive how detail  the trap was set but hey nice one  please do it again another time 
---
Niiiice ill be there
---
Pathfinder isn't maintained that often from what I've heard. I recently started using Tripwire and it is well maintained.
---
Why don't you just fly around until you see a bunch of miners and ask to join them?
---
I still do not understand how tf can medium arty had enough tracking to hit them.  
---
  
---
and noone using Weapon Disruption Burst projector. Some on them + web projektor and many of the stay tackled and dead probably
---
Pretty sure your starting ship is fitted with an afterburner.
---
What? 99% of pirat kills are just ganks... you cant loose fights if the only thing you do is not fighting.
---
And bringing up the argument "they have more numbers than us" is just retarded if you are the guy that declared war in the first place. This just to be able to get ganks out of it...
---
No, when you pod someone, his corpse will be in space.
---
If there was a corpse in cargo, it will drop in wreck.
---
Was half expecting the potato mode sun.
---
taking risks is the game, this is the best income source that isn't braindead ratting or mining. grab a cheap gila for t3 and work up from there
---
Man swooping in on that first kill is so damned good! This is awesome, well done mate. 
---
*Note: all structures currently reinforced
---
"Low karma anon." Because it's all about the karma, isn't it?
---
Plus it's annoying as fuck having to take the trunks off the corpses to dress them again for my dinner parties on my yacht. Think about that!
---
That mechanic was obnoxious
---
There are some cheaper fits (ex: passive Gila is around 300m with t2 fit) and you can pay this back pretty quickly so even if that happens, you are ahead.
---
I have only lost one ship to DC and it was bad office wifi, but have run 300+ sites by now. Can confirm I am well ahead of my investment.
---
It does feel bad when it happens but the risk is worth it IMO.
---
There are a ton of gotchas when it comes to deploying Pathfinder, a few missing dependencies that aren't documented...
---
A destroyer or frigate that can fit one single large weapon, be it projectile, hybrid or the like, a real glass cannon with a long reload time and single shot. Kinda like strapping a cannon to a jeep
---
LOL Eve's N+1 problem strikes again.
---
Jita IV - Caldari Business Tribunal Information Center is a natural instant-undock.  Shouldn’t be an issue getting out of jita using that.
---
I can't see anyone with more than a single rorqual bothering to do this, ever. The ones with a single rorqual? They won't bother with the effort after the first 10 times.
---
Thanks friend
---
I swear it is not, I have looked everywhere, no afterburner. I made the account a long time ago and then never played, then came back and started in the tutorial after quite some time, do you think that might have bugged it?
---
So serious...
---
Last time we did this, it was in Kalevala and it was more than three times that many ihubs that died, not to mention all of the aborted moon fracks, dead jump gates and general salting of the land that occurred.
---
Or use a neutral alt to warp yourself to an insta-undock bookmark. 
---
It's time to fly on a zipline!
---
I forgot to upgrade my clone and was in space at downtime before a patch.
---
RIP
---
I think I get what you’re going for... but your analogy sucks... is someone like that bait for rage?... yes... but specifically because of the impact they have on lives. EVE may be virtual, but the ccp data seemed to show a “shocking” impact to the csm on newbies from these groups. So your analogy in most of our minds only reinforces why we should continue to rage against these groups... cause would you at some point go “you know, I think pedophiles have taken enough of a bad rep, let’s chill” I hope the answers no.
---
Woo congrats bro! This is not meaningless in anyway. Nice kill and hope you can keep the tend going! Good luck bro!
---
&gt; I made the account a long time ago and then never played
---
Assuming you're in a Rookie ship? If you are just repackage and assemble the ship, if you've upgraded to another ship that won't work.
---
Way back when in the long ago beginner ships did not have an afterburner.
---
You have parties the scope and breadth of which I had no clue.
---
If there is a miner autistic enough to spend 20 minutes arranging his depots this way each time he repositions, let him.
---
Just using Stratios won't make you immune to solo Asteros. And it absolutely won't make you immune to other Stratioses. You have to know how to fly properly. And if you do - why don't use Astero instead? It's faster.

I really enjoyed the Grand Prix event. It gave me HUNDREDS of new dinner guests. I had many a soul providing me information on the best spot to invite new guests. My yacht was bustling with activity during those halcyon days. 
---
Now I'm doomed to stalking PF gates and the guests seem much less willing to sit at my dinner table. 
---
They spam fireworks and other things to lag out your loading time, in doing so getting free kills. Not an exploit though. Obviously. 
---
Mobile depots shouldn't even have timers.  Like wtf they are cheap little things that shouldn't be considered a building.

As a rule, nubs don't make money station trading regardless of capital. More complete answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b2re83/fun_in_stations/eiuogg5/). Perhaps you're the exception and if so, don't reveal your secret.

I just recently returned from a long break.

I want to branch out a little and get into some mining. What is the best options? Not really looking for entry level, and not really want to look at a rorq quite yet. 
---
Could also just dock into a station in your pod, you'll get a new ship
---
A lot of people just dish it out with us and have a good fight. We lost plenty. Won plenty too. Occasionally there are titans, but not that often. Some just like to complain and whine more than they like to fight. Each to their own, I guess.
---
Its not a war until somebody deploys their entire super fleet.

AWOX IS OK SO LONG AS IT'S FUNNY
---
As the other person said asking a subreddit dedicated to a game if you should play it is likely to be pretty skewed towards yes. If you want to play it then play it. 
---
For corps look at the official forums and the recruitment section there. Corps will list out what they are all about. 
---
Avoid most corps who claim to do everything (exceptions are probably the mega corps). Do your research on the corp too. How many active members they have, how active they are on zkillboard, what ships they are flying and if that matches what they say they are all about, if their active times match your usual play hours and so on and so on. 
---
R/evejobs is fine but realistically it’s the same few corps that post there and you’ll get a much bigger list of options on the forums. Even better is meeting people in game and finding people you enjoy playing with but that’s harder to do. 
---
its funny first time I started playing the game I got blapped in high sec by code. Talk about wake up call
---
Observe them for names, then once they dock convo them from an alt with some detective sounding name/title and enquire how they came in posession of a body found in their ship's cargo by the station' customs...
---
Please don’t take it as criticism. I was trying to counter the narrative of “Snuff just drops titans.” Losing a fight is okay. Bob knows I’ve lost plenty.
---
I know that. =)

There is a 30m caracal fit that can run t3 electricals. Run them until you get a proving conduit, it leads to a pvp arena. Sometimes you won't get someone and you get great loot or you will get another person, who you will most likely be able to out kite and get them to pay you a ransom to save their expensive ship.
---
Pfft you call that awoxing, those are rookie numbers
---
Nah
---
kill guth
---
small if not big.
---
In which case this provides incentive for those who do not have 8-10 rorqs, but only one or two to mine with and the autism to support them.

---
Nice, My first kill was a Rookie ship who was flagged suspect.
---
A disclaimer that I am not a botter.
---
This is actually fairly hard from a botting perspective, if I had to guess. Firstly, because anoms do not repeat grids with any meaningful frequency, to get bot positioning on those you'll have to have some sort of 3D spatial awareness around rocks to get positioned successfully, and you'll also have to deal with the randomness of the actual placement, and bouncing/reanchoring, etc. I tested this at some point and I believe depots can anchor randomly at one of 8 points at the corners of the bounding box of your ship; with 1 depot it doesn't matter, but it definitely does if you're trying to anchor 2 of them nearly exactly 5000m apart. You'll have to have the Rorq pilot come in in a small-model frig with 2 depots, find a 5km line segment clear of obstacles, and bookmark at the beginning, end, and midpoint, and also possibly do a distance check between the depots to see if the range is within tolerance. The "finding a line segment clear of obstacles" and "fly along it" is trivial for human pilots but it's super hard for a run of the mill bot. It also might take a long time which will kill the overall mining efficiency of the Rorq.
---
It's far easier just to program it to light a cyno, have the bot ping caps, and be in an alliance with instant super response. There are alternative strategies that would be both efficient and easier too, like going 3/2 on mining drones, or just having barge/venture bots. Especially as barge mining begins to eclipse Rorqual mining efficiency, I do think a lot more mining botters who read the writing on the wall will turn to stuff like clusters of Hulks, possibly with 1 cheap t2 mining drone booster Rorq at most.
---
There are some bots that do currently tasks like anchoring depots on gates (like the MOONPIRE bot) and anchor MTUs, but I think they generally rely on just going to a series of pre-made bookmarks or simple stuff like zero on site warpin. I don't see that strategy of static bookmarks being usable outside actual static asteroid belts. I think moon rock extractions are also sufficiently random enough in rock placement that it wouldn't work either.
---
Not saying it's impossible or that nobody will do it, but it definitely sounds cancerous to bots too.
---
Chat works where I play. 
---
J_Hemphill for CSM!
---
/u/Tack122 already pointed out that moons don't work that way, but here is the reasons why:
---
* The rocks are not very large, especially compared to stuff like spod in Colossals
---
* The rocks are spread out over a pretty big disc
---
* The rocks are semirandomly positioned and actually can move for a good couple hours
---
* The ore is incompressible
---
Because of this, there is more Rorqual movement required on moons than ice belts, ore anoms, and any decently dense asteroid belts.
---
remove by scooping to cargo - even better way :\^)

I hate being told what to do...Take my upvote !
---
I know you're probably being sardonic but just in case you aren't or there are some genuine spod brains reading, that's a good way to get your Rorq stolen.
---
I have not Rorq mined in a while and I only did so briefly, with 1 Rorq, because I had no other ways to fund PLEX with only a few play hours a week. I've since sold it off. I'm more often on the Rorq-killing side and I understand how boring that content feels well enough.

maybe raise the LP for capturing a plex cause they are far more difficult and you can't do them with a venture / atron some shit without dying

&gt; if the previous posts about his ban were true

&gt;if

how do you know they were?

ccp pls make rorquals have 10k ehp so my nano gang can kill it
---
You dont seem like a very happy person, would you like to talk about it friend? Im here for you
---
Do you know how the word "if" works?
---
I remember my first solo kill which was actually just this year despite me hanging around for a longer time already. I had more adrenaline in me than for my last job interview or final exam. I decloaked way too early and targeted and scrammed a Relic Site Container by accident at first. I was SO nervous... and also didn't manage to get his pod after the kill because i forgot to scram him for like 2 seconds because I had a retard brain lag deluxe.
---
I had flown in many fleets, and a lot of them had been fun and exciting, but solo killing the first guy was an incredible experience and I was hyped for another 30 minutes and needed to make a tea and cook something to get down to earth... lol
---
Never ever forget that feeling and excitement you had, it's something special. It tells you how beautiful this game can be behind all these countless grinding hours and complex cascades of investment.
---
Marshy's been back for a while, but what I watched yesterday was moving alts one-by-one not broadcasting. 
---
I always thought it would be funny to roll up in a cheap ship and just light a cyno in a random hostile system for the lols, nobody coming through the cyno, just a random guy lighting a cyno in a system to make people nervous.
---
Exactly this, I've said this myself for a long time.
---
The Rorq would honestly be good enough without the highest mining yield in the game. With their boost and actual tank they are strong enough as siege Orcas to be the core of a mining fleet. They were already a promising content generator for fleets and they've been a major driver of conflict since their current conception.
---
Excavs were a mistake that promoted capital proliferation and created a crazy choke on the market for both excavs and injectors that required new entrants to pay a high entrance cost just to compete with established miners, and drove the optimal solution to be a herd of Rorquals and nothing else. Ore prices were already doomed once mining became viable as a isk-making activity on par with ratting but excavs didn't help. They also weren't thought out well enough as the whole mobile depot thing has shown, and solutions like volume changes are just band-aid. Excavs have also just promoted an expectation of reward that have caused so much salt and whining on both sides of the fight when previously just getting the fight or a guaranteed capital kill was already a good enough improvement over the stagnant lack of nullsec content.

I can't export fits any more and get an error message if I try.
---
The previous posts about the bans indicate the ban was a temp ban (30 days), not a permanent one.
---
Why do you care so much that you made a reddit thread about it...
---
Any one got a bomb?
---
Feel free to try? Content is content kiddo.
---
Not likely. :) Nor true
---
There was no ban. 
---
&gt; What this tells me is that the GMs either need to find out how the ban has been circumvented, or a few GMs themselves need to be reviewed.   
---
Sounds like the words of someone who knows what "if" means.
---
I still remember my first kill and the shakes after. Good for you bud! 
---
Perhaps you're right. I've heard rumor that bots have some pretty unholy abilities because they aren't double-clicking in space, they can have the ability to read the coordinates of objects on grid and move on precise vectors. Maybe CCP frustrated that - I'm not a botter nor an bot author. That's just what I recall being whispered about some years ago.
---
But by Bob, I hope you're right.
---
They could not dock fast enough?
---
There wasn't? I know you two are fairly close so I'll trust that, Olmeca.
---
Just saying even if the ban did happen it wouldn't have been a lie for him to be back.
---
That kind of sucks though, I would hope that at least the policy were enforced regardless. Cheating for whatever reason diminishes the value of gameplay.
---
Such epicness ! Most fights i took part last for less than 2min, must be amazing when its that long ! 
---
Great video !
---
You'd need a few more than A bomb.
---
The fleet ball mechanics is one if the things I hate most about Eve, but I suppose there isn't an easy bumpless solution to the problem.
---
A content creator is back. The horror (*weeps in Carebear*)
---
There was no ban. He went to a vacation for 4 days. People hyped about his absence. Then hyped more when he came back. This was months ago. We killed stuff since then in delve. He got a new contract now so is moving ATM.
---
There is no cheating. He is saving 5 minutes every day by broadcast logging in which is legal by CCP. He left it on and had an accident on chat which didnt affect the game at all. But the Goon smear campaign was so strong even neutral parties are assuming some kind of chat. Ignoring that there is literally no game activity for an afk camper like him to use broadcasting with. 
---
At any rate, there being so much talk yet no punishment about it should tell you something.
---
Yeah that type that reads the coordinates, that's the kind reading memory from the game itself and is pretty advanced though decently common.
---
Obviously any screen reading bots are pretty much boned right out of the gate because 3D is really hard without a brain to process the screen picture or lots of very clever camera movement and image recognition at which point it's really not worth it.
---
The memory type that can read coordinates still has a chance, but screwups are bound to happen on occasion with closely spaced rocks and it also wont be a cakewalk to write.
---
No one will steal a rorqual that would be rude
---
Kill the rats. "Oh good I need the sec status" 
---
Don't worry Loro, that's what we're here for
---
I think that happens if you jettison? Not sure
---
Well Testicals better BR % than snuff! 
---
Not to mention all the shit they had on KS that did/could not respond lol.
---
Agreed. They are very effective against literally any subcap that gets within vindi web range. And with webs/neuts on that bhaal going out to 50km or so, he was very dangerous even to cerbs that strayed too close (bhaal would web/neut, vindi would dive, dreads would blap). At the time I felt kind of bad withdrawing our heavy armor and coming back with kitey stuff, but now that I've gotten to reflect on it I'm pretty happy with that call. We would have just kept feeding armor otherwise. 
---
Yup, i will when I get home!

Looks like the hel pilot was kinda short on budget when fitting🤔
---
your posting is what's wrong with /r/Eve
---
Was waiting for this to be posted ever since i saw the kills.
---
Sounds like a good buff for marauders ccplz
---
12 minutes, can I get a time stamp? 
---
Olmeca, I know you two got your own case, but when you argue like this it's really hard to be convincing to a neutral party. It's not that goons are canvassing so hard, it's that a lot of what you two say genuinely shoots yourself in the foot in the court of public opinion.
---
Like recriminating Rorqs--yes, it is known at least some broadcast and that is also bad, but it doesn't in any way provide exoneration for mar5hy and really makes you sound less convincing. To a neutral party, it's not one or the other, it's ban them both.
---
So is the "no ban therefore," argument, since the faith in CCP's investigation or lack of bias has been undermined for a long time. I mean you would say CCP is either blind or biased to Rorq multiboxers, wouldn't you? There's no reason why the selfsame arguments haven't applied in mar5hy's case, at least to the layman. If instead there is evidence that CCP noticed and passed at least some sort of OK judgment that would help your point a lot. Like a GM swinging by and saying it's OK but making sure to clarify the limitations that other input broadcasts aren't allowed.
---
To a neutral party, no punishment could mean mar5hy is innocent. However it could also mean CCP overlooked things. Claiming a ban to quiet public opinion when in fact no ban has happened--that certainly doesn't improve mar5hy's trustworthiness. Hence why this post exists at all. (Did he actually claim such a thing?)
---
The wording of your posts about goon bias on the sub have also really undermined credibility for your cause. I understand how you must have felt, but I think that ended up hurting more than it helped.
---
In the meantime there are things like the batch chat, and more poignant evidence like the death of a batch of Trolleones which possibly indicates that mar5hy uses broadcasts to cloak his chars on login. The evidence is overwhelmingly against you, it seems. It's possible of course that this is a goon op--maybe they scanned a bunch of trolleones during logoff and one day sprung them all with that claim. It's possible a GM gave him an OK and mar5hy feels he can't share it because of the policy. But to neutral parties, an overwhelming amount of evidence has been presented against you and only ill-formulated arguments have come as a reply.
---
I realize neutral opinion doesn't matter to the actual case which is with CCP, and I don't know if you two care at all. I think you do otherwise it doesn't make sense to try in the first place. Having a good reputation will help your other enterprises, probably, whatever. I choose not to pick a side in this debate without seeing for myself--but I hope this is insightful to you as to why neutral parties are swayed towards the goon narrative over yours, and how to improve that response in the future.
---
There was nothing solid to back up the ban, only some goon krabs yelling out loud in reddit
---
We got him
---
In order for players to interact with anything FW whatsoever, CCP need to fic FW itself first and bring it back to the living.
---
Not a bad proposal though. If they ever bother to touch that caps transit space
---
My first legit kill was a pirate slasher in Mateber in late 2005.  He’d gone AFK at a planet while flashy, I nailed him with a dual 150 Thorax
---
These kinds of corps have always been around, since the beginning of wardecs in Eve.
---
They’ve exclusively been manned by absolute trash players who are only in this for a shiny killboard that they loudly pretend comes from standing up to the big bad null blobs.
---
But in practice they camp trade hubs in shiny gangs with a scout on every single gate, neutral logi on standby and a ball shriveling averseness to any kind of actual fight. 
---
They’ll stomp gangs of new players and actually link people to those fights when called out for literally only ganking lone players.
---
Fuck them, their entire playstyle, and fuck anyone who accepts a former PIRAT member into their corp after the new wardec changes hopefully ruin their little shitler operation.
---
Well, they want to still play the game. Even very dense people will understand what that means - bigger FW LS entities go to live elsewhere.

This worked, or maybe it was repackaging the ship, but either way when i got a new on it had an afterburner pre-installed. Must have been a bug since they updated the tutorial missions and starting ship.

---
Well...
---
worstplayerever doesn't make the vids, he just posts them here for lussy lou
---
nyes
---
*adjusts monocle
---
Why is olmecas argument poor though, he literally said things as they are/were without inserting emotions or opinions.
---
Marshy accidently typed in chat with broadcasting on, shock and awe what a cheater, he can spam local better than anyone else.....1
---
&gt; I just joined a wormhole Corp, and am thinking about training a Bhaalgorn. Are they still useful in the current meta
---
this is a question you should ask your corp, not reddit. if your corp uses bhaalgorns, they are useful to train into. if your corp does not use them, they are not useful
---
Well sniped
---
&gt; at some point piloting skill becomes more important then that extra 5% falloff.
---
piloting skill is the more important thing, but having piloting skill *and* that extra 5% falloff makes you that much stronger
---
you really cant, if you are unable to even click on it to see where it is :)
---
Was he wearing a wizard hat?
---
I believe my first kill was one of the galente T2 frigs. I was a noob in a brutix. Myself and a few fellow noobs had been wardecd and were without guidance, so obviously we were completely overwhelmed by the whole thing.
---
I think this was the only kill we got but it was amazing. 
---
useless dumbass
---
You certainly won't become a better person if you rely on reddit for life advice.
---
You don't understand EVE
---
Starting to feel a little bad for them tbh
---
You'll be going places, keep it up!
---
send him all your isks and biomass
---
It's not that he's saying something that's false. It's that the way he's saying it is unconvincing, the structure of his argument.
---
Suppose your neighbor is accused of being a puppy kicker. (He is not.)
---
He tells you "I don't kick puppies and the fact that I haven't been arrested should tell you something. Besides, what about the Chinese, when those people who have a festival for eating dogs?"
---
He could be very well telling the truth and be someone who is gentle and loving to all animals. In fact all of those statements could be factually correct. But you can see why that defense is... problematic? Extremely unconvincing?
---
This is the literally same structure that Olmeca has forwarded for two of his points. I don't say that Olmeca is wrong, but I do think he should really change how he says that if he wishes to be convincing.
---

---
You can be your own CEO of your own corp in our alliance bro - put as much isk in your wallet as you need.
---
Nonsense. Of course you can.
---
well everyone else has answered the first question so it is my turn to be furry lore trash, yaaay
---
the empires are mandated by concord to share all technological breakthroughs they make. the jove were part of concord when this became a thing, but the extent of their investment on the matter remains unclear.
---
the jove were going extinct long before the incident, and it is now clear that the final iteration of their empire is dead for good. the few thousand remaining jove are speculated to have migrated outside new eden. the society of  conscious thought has inherited the jovian directorate's position and functions, but it doesn't have any jove in its ranks.
---
At fanfest?
---
Is it because you're not in NC.?
---
True
---
now you going to make a post each time you kill a 300m ship?
---
I'm the past when I've lost a ship with corpses in they appeared in space around the wreck. Was a long time ago.
---
When is what players see ingame evidence lol.
---
Ccp are the ones with logs
---
Ccp are the only one that have evidence
---
Fuck off with your theories, and let the people that have this as their work do it
---
Bro, after 15th thread on this topic why are you wasting my time with this wall of text. I quickly skimmed it out of respect.
---
I mention Rorquals at every instance because those are the ones I interact with daily, and they are in Goons. If there was 15 threads about Mar5hy then I should get to mention them here and there to discourage people from using it. FWIW I thank whenever a multiboxer scoops gradually, and I think there is a great reduction in Rorq broadcasting.
---
The death of a batch could equally mean he logged stuff on (he logs in increments of 10), went to get a coffee, and forgot to cloak manually (imagine doing that 10 times each login).
---
At the end of the day conclusive evidence will be unavailable to anyone but CCP. So what do we do if we want to get past at "defending my own space cult" attitude and zoom in the objective truth? 
---
I think it all boils down to this question: Does this person plays in a style which broadcasting is extemely handy and game-affecting (CCP's own criterion)?
---
The answer is no. He is an afk camper. Each of his chars are in a different system. The best he could do is cloaking by broadcast. Which, if you leave behind the perspective emerging from zealous affiliations, itself isn't a huge deal tbh. He saves 5 min each day by logging in. Say he does 5 more by cloaking. Not at all as big a deal as someone saving excavators, or bombing fleets via broadcasting, or freighter ganking etc.
---
I think this alone closes this case.
---
/r/all Bait :) I like it
---
Is that the title of one of the vidéos ?
---
It looks like you have read two olmeca posts were he mentioned rorqs and marshy and just went with the assumption that thats the only argument he uses.
---
Also, if a guy were accused of kicking puppies, and the police did an investigation on it. and he didn't get some form of punishment, then he is clean
---
I suggest chemical restraint + amputation below head

I'm not spinning some theory or trying to imply something. I haven't even really followed your space drama. I was looking at your reply and you were complaining about how even neutral parties tend to assume the goons are right. I was only pointing out the ways your reply right there said things in a way that would turn people *away* from your case even if you were telling the truth.
---
I don't care what happens as long as CCP doesn't do anything ridiculous and it doesn't appear to have done so.
---
Does attacking an MTU in highsec get you concorded or given suspect/criminal/limited engagement timers?
---
&gt; subbed accounts have the advantage
---
if anything, not subbed accounts have the disadvantage, because they are supposed to be subbed. the number differences are usually offset by where you and your opponent sit on the rock-paper-scissors spectrum, and mirror matchups are rare enough as they are.
---
Not an option.

---
Alternatively, if you culturally condition a hundred reddit warriors to constantly shit on 2 people, neutrals who see those posts will be more likely to dislike those 2 people as well and discredit their arguments. 
---
I have read this reply and know he uses others I have no interest in digging up because they are irrelevant to the point. I am pointing out, not a truthfulness argument, but that the structure of this reply as an example of a possible reason why so many are assuming the goon narrative. A neutral party who casually follows this and doesn't really invest time will find a less questionable argument from the goon side and may side with them.
---
Mar5hy has caught a lot of shit that way. So perhaps cleaning up the points and presenting them in a less questionable way will help to settle opinions better, which I believe is something that is helpful.
---
Like saying that CCP has investigated and cleared him, that has a lot more weight than saying there was no wrongdoing because there was no punishment. You have just provided an example yourself there, see, of how it could have been worded better.
---
Wtf. Where is there a wharf in Nebraska??  Wish I could go /: 
---
if the rorq is no longer a viable mining ship, then it either needs to lose the core (or make the cycle something like 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes), or drop down in build cost by about half.

And you’re supposed to be in HK?

What you are gonna see  in the future is all hi sec war dec corps joining up. There will be one main alliance - probably Pirat. Then the F1 heroes from null will move into hi sec - beat Pirat and bring peace to all of Eve.

I’m not judging, you’re free to do as you please, you ARE after all one of New Eden’s elite. Maybe, and this is just conjecture on my part, not everybody at the table enjoys sharing it with corpses. I know it’s one of those obnoxious and offensive prejudices people have, some just can’t get over themselves.
---
I hope your next party is a wonderful success!
---
Alts, tbh it is easier this way. 
---
Actually piloting your ship for a minute every now and then to protect ~60% of its value is an "absurd amount of effort"?
---
The problem with making rorqs more vulnerable is that there's still little incentive to hunt them other than for the sake of it. Excavators having a chance to drop would address that.
---
When you make a post on reddit because you have killed 3 ship ...

we tackled the naglefar while bashing a poco. We knew it was a trap and expected some fleet in back up, not 2 more cap and one vindi ^^
---
we bring 3 guardian first (+1 later) and the the dps isn't managable AT ALL (logi speaking)
---
We manage to kill the vindi thanks to a good boosh but we suffered heavy losses and decide to stop feeding.

Awsome fight although in the wrong side. I have never seen so much corpmates dieing under my reps T_T

Great Vid ! I hope this will motivate more people to come to live, fight and die in WH space.

See you for the round 2 !
---
Taking the shortest path between two systems.
---
You're not wrong.
---
Nah.
---
Don't be a dumbo, put some tank on your ships and keep mind of the EHP/value of what you're transporting and you're very unlikely to get killed by CODE.
---
PIRAT however are like that kid hurting puppies and cats, they only target the helpless and weak. The only solution for this is a lifetime of assrape in prison, however we do not have an EvE equilavent of this sadly.

Remember: Always laugh at and taunt PIRAT, regularly remind that they're bottom feeders.

So long as your not auto piloting and flying something relietevly fast you will be fine. You should be wearing that flashy red icon with pride.

Then you are moving and you can take even battleship as facpo webs.     
---
Sorry but doing something dumb just to regret it soon after is something in pure EVE spirit. 
---
I m sure some people will mine with 3 exca and 2 t2. Not sure people being able to multibox 2+ rorq will do it your things it s too much time. a rorq solo, yeah why not.

Hey, guys, I'm curious what CCP has done in the last 3 years? Everything I can find about eve's game state is from 3 years ago..

You still have much to learn about senseless and unfair killing. Enjoy it and take it to the extreme end of overkill.

https://zkillboard.com/kill/75884887/
---
When I know I should, I take a travel ceptor and, yeah, you're right, I like it when security announces my presence.  My issue is when you're flying something big and slow like a battleship or a freighter, take gate, see security warn you that they're coming to kill you and now there's nothing you can do about it because you weren't paying attention to the fact that you were -1.0 BEFORE the roam last night.
---
very nice, must see this more often :)

Jesus, mods are def biased if they delete posts concerning goonies

Well in autopilot you can choose option - avoid higsec.       
---
Never mined in a rorq, but had to test this on sissi :D
---
Around 2 minutes for the setup (with AB/MWD on rorq maybe faster)..
---
* Drop 1st depot
---
* Keep at range 5k
---
* Drop 2nd depot (maybe earlier possible than with 5k range)
---
* keep at range 2.4k on the first depot
---
* stop ship early, so it will float in range
---
Maybe something for the alliances which bother about the \~2b isk or where no super umbrella will save the rorqual.
---
i've been saying the same for months.
---
i'm all for the indy command ships to have a respectable yield - but there's no fucking way they should be out-mining mining ships. even more so when doing so completely obsoletes the need for mining links, on a ship that has way more ore capacity than you can shake a stick at.
---
the rorqual just does EVERY aspect of mining better than any other ship, all on 1 hull. it needs to suck at something - and since we already have dedicated mining ships, yield should be that thing... which is easily achieved by just removing excavators.
---
This is so sad Aura play despacito
---
I, uh.... I’m not a smart man.. 
---
Is it the insta locking tornadoes which cost them about 115mil? What ship could be used to gank the tornadoes? Is there not a bunch of people who gank the gankers? I'm new, just wondered.
---
Gratz - Kind of reminded me of my first - The adrenaline rush is awesome.

Wow this is a big achievement I remember when I got my first jump freighter I spent a lot of time mining in high security space in my Hulk (F*ck goons) and finally got one and joined red frog hauling to move peoples assets around the galaxy but people didnt tell me that i actually needed a character with a cnyosural field theory skillbook to use a cynosural field to jump my jump freighter to and when i finally got one and got a friend to light me a cynosural but he didnt know how to light a cynosural field and i ended up bouncing off the station like what happens when someone in code bumps you (F*ck code and goons) and i ended up dying

Don't lose it to a super on the undock of a station.

First time I dropped on an Astero, in a bomber, was terrifying.  I could tell it was taking too long, and I was gonna die soon.  Then he scrammed the can and set his drones on it.

Well, according to p-hub statistics going about on the intertenz, the animated Japanese, err, shows are the most popular ones in Russia... so, yes.

Probably ever since the rorq rework yes. It’s used in drone mining yield rigs.

and way more bots, than players!

Congratulations!

I’ve been playing a few months and don’t have a solo kill yet, I imagine I’ll feel the same as you when it finally does happen.

Finally, would you mind sharing your fit?

We are .... ballger
---
bots can't handle this and you have to set all 20 rorqs manually , that's a lot of works  instead of no work at all

I'll form... the head.

This remind me my story this an time I bumped into Mach code ganker guy and he made my ship not warp and I expoloden I qhit 6 year after

Something being a low enough amount of work while being profitable enough to justify multiboxing 20 of them might be a problem in and of itself. :thinking:

Init had a political reason to drop Test with us?.. O__o
---
I'm confused... always thought they are just happy to drop their bombers on anyone, especially if that anyone is shot by us. And as far as I am aware, we don't need any reason, political or not, to drop onto someone...
---
Was there really a political reason, or is it yet another of those goons spins to seem involved in things they had nothing to do with?..
---
Idc if it's a 3mil 300mil or 3bil ship if its PIRAT a smile doth appear
---
Well as we live in a society if innocent untill proven guilty, id say regardless of the argument one should not judge unless authorities (in this case ccp) has made a call which they have and it was innocent. So more discussion is kinda pointless ;)
---
just get rid of sec status. it doesn't add anything to the game, it's just a punishment for having fun if you live in highsec
---
If there only was a fleet command that allowed you to warp fleet/squad members simultaneously, that would be great. Then we finally wouldn't have to input broadcast .....

the weird question ,- have they ever been in AT? i prob know the answer but still

Thank you for your touching story Jamal!
---
Coming from your homicidal little Corp, this is quite fitting. &lt;3
---
&gt;Once we did this we were able to keep them tackled, but couldn't apply enough DPS or neuts to break anything they had on field, which is when we hit the batphone button.    
---
That, for me is the shameful part.   
---
I get it, you got counterpicked, nothing you could do with your size, skills and mass for me that would've been a good opportunity to gf and move on. Instead you felt your jimmies rustled and decided to batphone basically all of the non-russian j-space to basically blob a handful of caps. Other, more skillful options (like spearfishing, idk, first thing that comes to mind) were not available it seems.   
---
The moral high-ground here goes to the ruskies in my opinion (doubled by their clear show of sportmanship by deciding to siege green and keep the fight going when they could left) and this was a shameless gank that I don't see anyone in this thread owning to. 
---
I remember when you got your first jump freighter too!

Alrighty then... So CCP is gonna magically know how to repo/fix your issue, right got it.

I didn't say it wasn't.  It was OP in his video who seemed to think we should have just been trying to nano him...

How has the removal of sugar from iron bru effected your life?

Man what is it with eve players enjoying some of the worst music ever conceived...
---
If you got a titan tackled and you know nothing more is coming from their side and you're in a 5 man group, would you back off, as you know you yourself couldn't kill it? Or would you basically get everyone there that you know to see that thing go down?
---
And Lussy Lou posted the video, not Sound of Mind or anyone of the involved groups, so he showed it everyone.
---
What 30 man-comp would you take in subcaps to take out 2 nags, an apostle, bhaalgorn and vindi, if you have no planning time but you have to react immediately, which means you have to have your stuff ready from the start.
---
Usually Lussy Lou wins basically every fight he starts in w-space. There are numerous videos about it, that a batphone results in 100+ ppl appearing, is probably just because he batphoned in multiple directions and didn't expect everyone would come. Usually it is maybe 1 group that has the manpower, time and the connection at that particular time. Even though all the groups involved are usually hungry for kills, nobody was waiting for a batphone signal from any of the other groups, it just fitted the circumstances so basically everyone joined in and it resulted in the fight you saw. :)
---
Umm.. For people with 40 Rorqs this wont help.. But an alt in a nestor sitting next to you.. Even has MJD..
---
It was disastrous for the first few weeks, but then I realised I could just pour a couple spoonfuls in and we’re back on top !!!

This is meaningful. This is worth commenting on. Well done.

👏👏 Good effort team 👏👏
---
I know 0 lore but i always like hearing the tid bits like this
---
Fuckin congratz! Space truck away.
---
A nyx gets five total launch bays, meaning it can never have more than five groups of fighters out. It can launch five groups of lights, 2 groups of space superiority fighters, 2 groups of support fighters, 3 groups.of heavies or any mix of those types of fighters.
---
Each group of (dps, not ss or support) gets two weapon systems, typically a gun and a missile. Because he has dps fighters in all of his launch tubes he can activate 10 weapons.
---
He's volleying as hard as he is because a nyx gets a ton of damage and jfs don't get a lot of ehp
---
Test distances itswlf from its pets so far they have a seperate ping system for them voltron pings 
---
You should be hauling with a neut-corp alt.
---
Where is the guy from PIRAT to brag about his ketogenic diet, large penis, and many attractive females that definitely find him attractive?
---
look at his lock ons, he's getting like 20 icons of missiles - is this just a graphics bug? when I use them on a nid on SiSI i only see 3

Super carrier alpha, Nyx with 4 DDA.

Look at pretty much every renter region, delve and frt space.

KWG are notorious aswell
---
This is so much better, Thank you so much for all your hard work  :)
---
Wow you should post this story to the Eve Facebook page, I bet they’ll love it
---
He's mashing his keys.
---
Down sides is its just really hard to do for ccp. So youll see lets say alot of bans in delve of bots. But because its so dense it really doesnt mean anything but if you take drone regions its so far and in between you still dont get any info. We already kniw where we have a rough times with bots are. If you have a renter area you have bots. So us big alliances dont go to renter areas to report the bits. Test Frt Goons Nc Skillu ect cant constant patrol and report suspected botters. So we dont get enough reports. People who make these bots its pretty damn hard to notice if someone is botting or not. 
---
I feel the heat map is a great idea but the way ccp deals with bots atm, its nothing but a far off dream of killing bots.
---
Omist is a big one and i think branch is swarming aswell
---
I wish someone had told me this. Be carefull OP super can oneshot a JF if you're not careful.
---
Sansha ships were armor tanked at one point, they got reworked into shield tanking ab ships, but slave set bonuses were never changed.
---
Came here expecting SNUFF to drop TEST again...make it happen boys
---
Gratz!  They are a lot of fun.  
---
Just remember that EVERYONE wants to kill you if you screw up, so fly it with caution and always have several escape cynos at the ready.  
---
Man, even undocking requires a monumental amount of effort. 
---
You seem to have forgotten about all the high sec regions too.
---
bro if you think GOTG, NCdot, Horde, and TEST don't have bots mixed in with their members as well I have sad news for you.
---
Dat ass!
---
So does the Society have any Jovian technology, or what exactly did it take over?
---
And where would I go to learn more on this? The chronicles seem like they’d tell an interesting story if read in the correct order, since at least some seem to interconnect, but alone they are either boring or confusing

If fax+dreads combo is OP u could def your home system easily. ;DD
---
PIRAT and their ilk are the reason a perfectly funxtional wardec system is getting nerfed into the ground. They managed to remove all the fun from the mechanic all for the sake of their precious kill boards. 
---
After 13 years of eve online, I am finally very sorry for you. 
---
grr goons... I have no idea what they have to do with you hulk mining in high-sec though. You do know we do not control, despite Mar5meca's claims, all of eve outside of empire space, right? 
---
A Nyx can have more fighters than a Nid.
---
We assumed that for years.
---
Agreed but, the current “kitey” meta makes that problematic outside of gate camps.

Down voted, eh? Fuck, EVE is filled with some right wing racist and homophobic douches. I expect more from the player base than I probably should I suppose.

everyone has bots everywhere, even highsec.
---
Just looked that up. Very interesting!!! Honestly just that one vid(plus the amount of value in ISK the guy I was watching found in one hack) peaked my interest in exploration. This may be something I try tonight, propbablu just the profession trainer to start while I train up some skills.

See https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/issues/445
---
Tldr: its chance based and theres no good way of representing this info, regardless of what EFT shows
---
To then import in to the fitting window, it's a basic feature of the program. I know copy/paste is also possible but when you use it for multiple characters or accounts it's annoying.

I read this as "please make eve fit my game style because I'm super important."
---
thumbsup hh brothur
---
I would also be down for a player maintained map for current bots. 
---
Including stuff like:
---
How confident are you those guys are botting?
---
What are they using for botting (fitting/ships)?
---
What they use for saving up (pos/citadel/cloak)?
---
What time they usually are active?
---
Also including names/corps/alliances
---
I wouldnt go as far as publicly sharing their timers though.
---
To answer your first question - if I got a titan tackled that I can't handle with my gang of 5 I would batphone. For two dreads and a fax that you can't handle in your 30+ fleet I don't think the comparison is valid.   
---
Lussy Lou posted the video also to show the lack of sportsmanship here, imo. The whole narration is geared towards that - "we hero-stayed for the fight, the others brute-forced their kills"   
---
The time to plan was there as they surely had time and mass to refit. They refitted to a shitty countercomp that still didn't have what it took to disrupt the setup. When they couldn't, instead of giving a good ol fashion "GF dude, that's a nasty comp", they batphoned everyone and their mom the fact that all came about proved beneficial in the end because it seems even the amassed powers of 2-3 corps weren't enough until HK came about :P   
---
as for your question - the lynchpin of that setup were the battleships - if a 30 man fleet of capable pilots focuses on removing/incapacitating them, I believe it were possible. As I said - booshing them to hell, dampening, ecm were all valid things to try before straight up calling 70 more people :P  
---
And, as I said - I don't disprove the outcome, after all in eve everything is fair game - i'm just a bit disappointed to see the effort in coming up with a legit counter being replaced with an effort (if it can be called) to batphone as many people as possible which resulted in me watching a gank instead of a fight. :P   
---
For once, a not crap post.. good pic also.. grats :)
---
Everyone in highsec is a bot or bot-aspirant.
---
If you made a pentagram out of Rokhs and chanted a few lines from Clarion Call 4 (I recommend just screaming what the fuck a few times) they say you can call in an RnK pipebomb on your fleet within the next four jumps. 
---
Thanks man, yeah it's a fun way to fly the Slasher.

Nice. I had one once the. Lost it to stupidity ☹️
---
But did you fuel the stations in your hole? :P

---
let's not get ahead of ourselves here, though - having 400 bombers alpha your fax is not comparable to what happened in this battle. 
---
It warms my heart to see that our old fun propaganda site is flickering back to life, and that Jules is still up to his old tricks. *Almost* tempts me to come back.
---
... and Soter laughs!
---
those 13mil tech 1 stabbers are a beauty, talk about value for your isk!
---
Bugger it. I'm  yorkshire seems rude not to attend
---
Well, as a SOV owner, you are responsible to what happens in your space (quote CCP Burger, Evesterdam 2019). So if you can't police your renting empire, drop the SOV or face consequences. I'm pretty sure CCP can come up with measures to hurt the SOV owners for confirmed botting cases. Thinking of changed respawn rates, system indexes, penalties on SOV/upgrade bills, upkeep costs, TCU destruction. 
---
If you have SOV, you have to manage it. If you don't, it will hurt and hopefully you'll lose it to a group that does police it. 
---
Would be a shame if something happened to it...
---
You may be good at eve but your logic sucks. If there's enough dps to break one fax there's enough dps to break every fax. They can't rep each other. Plus there was around 3000 goons in rage by the end lmao. 
---
u/NazAlGhul this man clearly has clearly broken goon law and must be reprimanded.
---
Annnd it’s gone 
---
Unless they detached the diamond rats from the old color code to circumvent problems woth changing their color.
---
That sounds like eve code to me, at least. 
---
Congratzs!   
---
Make sure you are smart about how you fly it.
---
I DID IT WITH A PH ALT
---
Congrats 
---
That's the spirit 
---
Oh, really? We're responsible for policing our members in space? Are we getting a slice of CCP's security budget, then?
---
That's pretty much refried bullshit. Players aren't going to volunteer to do CCP's job for them.

It's impressive they can at all. I have bots that run my various work activities and they are very adept at switching things up. I know I could seem like a active player if I really set my mind to it. it's almost irresponsible not to run armies of bots for everything :)

Pretty hard pressed to find a moment in the last year you guys undocked

Only problem I see is we get to know how effective CCP is at removing bots
---
This is like the first time you get in a fleet and you get a titan bridge.
---
Everyone spams "DON'T FUCKING BUMP THE TITAN I SWEAR TO GOD". You just say to yourself "I'm not a noob, I won't bump the Titan lol who does he think I am".
---
And then you bump the fucking Titan because you turned off your MWD too late.
---
I just want to be able to use a Pilgrim. Is that too much to ask?
---
it cant if you never undock
---
I've been gone for a minute? You guys coming back to lowsec? Of so, hello from GMVA
---
Well done! Now remember that if you jump to a lowsec station and there is a cyno nearby be ready to hit space and dock immediately... Also never jump to a freeport. :D 
---
What happens when you bump a Titan? What is even needed to make them move them since they're so massive (I assume)?
---
Sorry to hear man. Props for trying. You did good on our invasion POS the first time.
---
Dirty blobbitses of the big groups 
---
OH BOY

When you mash the button, it will look like that in the UI. It still will only be firing the max of 5 missile volleys (one per fighter).

---
Don't judge me.  So I lost a Gila, get off my back, jesus.
---
Just have a carrier next to you and drop excavtors in fleet hanger and either warp off or jump to cyno :P if you are mining in a rorq you can build carriers in no time.
---
Ho that was you lol. Yeah the best part is that I tried to unanchor the last raitaru to save it. 30mins before its unanchor i decide to go through our static HS to go buy something with my heron... the heron made the hole colapse. And I had no other toons inside ! Great success (Borat voice). So if someone goes by the wh there is a free raitaru

Today I woke up. Took my Scythe Fleet issue with 220mm Autocannons out for a spin. Suddenly, DANGER. My ship was blasting red as it was being hit my horrible enemies. It was just NPCs and i warped off gate. I was relieved I was still alive. But wait, I land in bubble! Omen Navy Issue over there, oh no! My ship going red once again, I put a web and scram on him as i overheat my microwarpdrive to get out of his point range and warp, ufff that was close.
---
I decide to reship to Orthrus, missile boat. FUCK YE. I undock and warp to the same gate, I get right ontop of him with 20km scram and I feel like a badass. Sure I was a true dick for reshipping into a better boat but hey, I blown him up with a merlin whoring on him at the end.

---
INIT renters in their buffer space of Pure Blind bot pretty consistently
---
Nope, CCP will add more good looking ships instead. Tip nighthawk, eos etc.

No where in my comment did I say anything along the lines of “but what about those guys!”
---
ELI5 : Gank looting.
---
i understand a bunch of Thalos or Purifiers shoot a freighter, and then someone come with a transport ship and loots the wreck. 
---
But how/why that transport ship doesnt go suspect as soon as it loots the wreck ?
---
thanks !
---
ccp has been nailing it with these trig skins
---
hope they add/revise some for the other ships, instead of just having shitty monochrome off-green skins
---
Rorqual hating propaganda.....
---
And a command that made all people in your fleet orbit you...
---
You wouldn't download a rorqual, would you?
---
I agree, but how do you stop blasters from encroaching on ACs, if you give them extra falloff...
---
Be sure to make multiple safes and make sure you make a bunch of cyno alts and be absolutely sure you put the cyno in the right location. 
---
I thought you had to be at least thirty five to use ellipses all the time...
---
Since its so fast already have you played with speed/sig tanking?
---
*ctrlv intensifies*
---
They're very easily moved when bumped by a BS using its MWD, or even BC-sized ships. 
---
Since fleets often warp a bit far from them (to prevent anyone from bumping into them, ironically), some people just gun at them using MWDs.
---
If you bump a Titan, it fucks up their alignment, and they take a long time to stop (as you can imagine considering their size). 
---
Worst case scenario, it can end up wayyyy off of a safe spot, someone cloaked spots it and it's hotdrop o'clock.
---
It was a huge deal back when Titans were protected by POS bubbles since they could be bumped off the bubble quite easily (making them vulnerable).
---
I'm not playing anymore so I don't know if it's the same with the tethering mechanic, but I'm guessin bumping a Titan off a station/tether isn't particularly a good idea either lol
---
All of my JFs were bought in an era when you could by a Rhea for less than 1.8 bil ISK (less than 500 PLEX atm)...
---
i mean we do have a BoT alliance
---
There were dozens of innocent exotic dancers, male on board.  You should feel ashamed
---
I have for sure, 125s, MSE, Neut, and get a nice tight orbit while you neut them out. I will probably also do a video of some of the fights I got flying it that way.
---
weird, all delve/frt botter I heard getting kick for botting end up in RMT or somewhere in the next (wasn't frt who kick RR for botting ?)
---
Or we could nerf the capitals + few offending subcaps, rather than buff 100 ships and throw the existing balance to the wind.
---
Beer is Primary 
---
Couple that with a line-of-sight mechanic and youve changed fleet pvp forever
---
That's when you refit your 30 subs to damps in the mids and bring 2 web lokis to just completely disable both subs (Bhaal+Vindi)...
---
Considering they had 2 hours of time while batphoning, they would have had these 2 hours overthinking their strat and refitting accordingly.

I hope for you she was a trap. Else we're gonna have a little explanation in the cave...
---
...aaaaaand it's gone.

"Russians"
---
Cylon ship \^\^
---
anything running top speed MWD at the Titan is sketchy. We go out in eagles and people get mad if you get too close
---
I think that the bots would be happy to provide a map for you of their competition 
---
What a pity that I'll miss this by a few days. Gonna be in the area visiting family over Easter, but I'll have already left by the time this happens.
---
&gt;!Death to Amarr; long live the Minmatar Nation.!&lt;
---
That's a shame dude.
---
Amarr Victor! 
---
The problem for most new people is getting there. So many gatecamps otw in. I hear syndicate is good and heading through PF system is a good way to go...
---
There used to be a player owned station in the middle of stain that is a free port open to all and mostly friendly. I wouldn't get caught outside, but you can sell your shit there too at a slightly lower price.
---
weebs out
---
That used to be an option?! 
---
Would only help vs. Stuka/Goku as they anchor, vs. casual BB-Fleet 
---
f.e. it wont help as they spread out to individual orbits and aligns.
---
Also John Caffeine of R'n'K has left the game years ago, so sklled pilot is missing ;-P
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/[region name here]#npc24
---
Nope, I'm right there with you. 
---
that's the one from evesterdam, right?
---
looks like the lost heroes or whatever it is for the rifter/typhoon.
---
so i completely agree, it's a damn nice looking skin.
---
Always always assume it's armed and plan  According to that assumption. 
---
and this what anime+mmo makes with your brain , kids.
---
Now to the next patient
---
I'm still not understanding the use case. Are you exporting the fit to XML file then importing into the EVE client? 
---
If so, you can use the EVE SSO &gt; Export Fitting option. Is this what you're talking about when you say it's annoying for multiple characters / accounts? What makes this window difficult to use, specifically?
---
If that's not what you mean, then are you exporting then re-importing back into pyfa? In which case, why?
---
I'm more looking for your workflow as it relates to these exported files. I don't mean to interrogate, but /u/FluorescentFlux and I are actively trying to source the use cases for this export, since we're thinking about removing it (xml format is old and we think barely used, and there's better ways to move data around usually). 
---
so the maps just going to be fully red then
---
Please dont encourage jean
---
Well, I mean, you WERE afk off gate. That's kinda asking to get pew pewed isn't it?
---
that memorial is epic
---
1) What is the average time you all play eve a day.  2 hrs, 4 hrs, 8 hrs (get a life) etc.
---
2) Anyone that is over, and lets be generous her, 8 hrs a day is probably a bot.
---
3) Ban them for a day.
---
is this damage control for what happened yesterday or a bad attempt at making test seem good at eve?
---
The game is whatever you want it to be. Some people make things, some blow things up, some trade items, and many provide support for those activities.
---
Read wikis and join "help" chat for the basic info, then find out about getting into a newbie friendly corp to see what you'd like to explore
---
Is it possible to get data of avg no. of active unique sessions per system? Or any other metric, perhaps number of jumps or any indication of people in space from any source?
---
That with monthly eco report, we can make rough correlations where there is most likely to be botting happening
---
It'll be an indicator at best. At worst, we'll know where the Krabs are having it the easiest and we can all go gank and roam there. It's a win win.
---
Allegedly blackmailing some corporation for a couple 10's of millions of dollars.  Also, what's it like being the lawyer for a stripper/porn star?
---
I had to poop 😄 Didn't feel I was in danger at that range. But in retrospect I should have just warped to a safe
---
Hi friendo.
---
Don't worry about 'understanding' the game in a few days, a few weeks, or a few months. Just do a bit at a time- and enjoy yourself. Do the tutorial agents- all of them IMO. They will give you a really basic understanding of simple stuff (and provide you with some items, and a few ships.)
---
While you're doing that, or traveling- I would spend time looking at this:
---
https://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post_img/eve-career-chart.jpg
---
That will give you some idea of what you can accomplish in eve. Of course, that's not all encompassing- but it should give you a good start.
---
If you find something that sparks your interest, or just want a more interactive, look around youtube.
---
Take your time, don't rush into things- and don't expect to understand everything at once. It's a process really, and can be overwhelming if you let it get that way. Small steps :) Stay away from 'newbie' corporations for now- until you get your feet underneath you. I would also suggest staying away from mining!
---
pwned 
---
I highly recommend joining a new player corp. ("Corporations" is just the space word for guilds/clans.) They're a fantastic way to learn about what all the game offers and find something you enjoy doing.  Check out some of the options in the Corportation window.
---
Dotlan is having a few issues right now, but if you want to spot bots, you want to use the #npc24 filter on the various null regions, primarily looking for renters. Look for the medium-ish activity areas, the high ones are usually supers/multiple carriers/etc.
---
For example:
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Tenal/E-72A3#npc24
---
That constellation is a likely candidate for bots. Check the systems from T-K1 to 3-QY and you can spot it. Medium-ish ratting numbers spread over many hours with near-perfect consistency over 48h. The Ranger Regiment areas near Branch have some bots too, but there are actual players mixed in there with them.
---
You can do the same in Wicked Creek: 
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Wicked_Creek/0FC-ZX#npc24
---
Some interesting systems around there.
---
Of course, nothing about this is foolproof and some are just people multi-boxing VNIs legitimately, but there are sadly a lot of areas in EVE that are completely infested with bots.
---
Actually, that ship probably has less stuff on it than a capsuleer ship. Allow me to explain.
---
According to the lore, a capsuleer controls his ship through nervous impulses, and he can arguably be called the brain of the ship. Everything we see when playing the game is info the capsuleer has access to.
---
If we take a look at that screen up there, we can sort of guess what's on there. Starting on the left, there's labeled buttons for menus, what could be heatmaps of the local area, the circles are sonar/radar view of the surroundings (something a capsuleer always has). In the middle area there seems to be 8 gauges thruster output power and 2 circles for fuel capacity maybe. There's a live chat with 4 buttons above (hang up, transfer on another screen, etc..) Below the gauges there's a bunch of health bars, for the different parts of the ship. Below the chat is a list of locations on the ship you can call. In the middle at the bottom is a keyboard to give commands to the ship. Top right is an overview, and below it is a map or the local area.
---
Most of that info (and much more) is something your capsuleer processes every second in game, and as a player you can also process D-Scan, a market and fitting window as well as your cargo pretty easily. On top of that, a ship has 10+ modules equipped, something not shown here.
---
This was my thesis on why this UI is alright if your nerves are not directly connected to your ship, and why capsuleer are badasses.
---
TL;DR: I waste 10 minutes writing something for no damn reason.
---
so is it really hard to understand the game. cause i dont usally play games alot i play simple games like bf4 gtav which are very simple just gun and run. but this game is by far the hardest one lol
---
I can't remember being in Deklein last night, but that's mainly because night and day have blurred into one, sleep is irregular and the only thing that is real any more is Drakes.
---
as a capsuler, I only see F1
---
Come fly in wormhole space ;)
---
Check the bottom of the page for contact details my dude
---
Excellent job, bravo
---
It's hard to understand every facet of eve. However, it's not hard to understand a small portion of it. Inside that small portion, you can always 'run and gun' do quick shit, and fully understand it. It's just a small part of the larger whole. many people make the mistake of trying to understand the 'whole thing' and then get overwhelmed. Specialize, and if you keep playing you'll eventually specialize into more things- giving you a larger understanding. 
---
always aim to have a spy in the corp you bash :p
---
Correction, Eve just got you! Enjoy! 
---
&gt;Completely clueless and need help
---
Same here. I'm about 7 years in now.
---
so what im i even looking at?. is this the different jobs or activites i can specialise in ? 
---
In theory when your fleet FC warps the fleet, your capsuleer responds to it, aligns the ship perfectly and warps to the exact coordinates. Give your little guy in the capsule some credit.
---
7 years . oh come on
---
You have to consider that "two dreads and a fax" is basically the most you can bring to a WH fight without using multiple holes. So it is the closest equivalent to a titan in k-space (the single biggest ship you can bring).
---
After living in w-space for about 8 years, I can ensure you that most groups in here will give you a fair fight. They'll not blob you to death. They might even reship and bring a weaker comp only to get a good fight out of it.
---
Sure that might not be true for everyone or for every fight but calling them out because they badphoned for this isn't the full picture. Most of the time you won't even get a connection in time. Like Tyrion said already this is not a typical outcome.
---
&gt;he bought ze dip
---
true.. but still, the fact that you need to have 20leshaks alone just to break a single fax is a joke.
---
as much as i like lussys vids, a setup like this just asks to get blobbed sooner or later.
---
Hey CCP! Yo I know lowsec and fw space are broken/dead but instead of fixing that can u make no colors better...
---
you underestimate autism level of eve players
---
Hi, read the legend- as it will explain the flowchart. It is a flowchart of some of the example 'things' you can do within eve. It's not all encompassing, but will give you a great starting point. Once you find something that grabs your interest, use that as a search term in youtube / google and dig a bit deeper.
---
Not really a bug, but they added the afterburner to the starter ship, when they added the new starting "event"
---
okay quick thing. what do i choose as an empire to explore??? quick?. does it matter at all what faction i choose?
---
As some already said, join a Corp. If you have totally no clue yet what you can do or want in this game i would personally suggest EVE University for the beginning, they have Campuses for High,Low,Null and Wormholes. If you already now you want to live in Null any of the Big Blocs can be a good start.
---
When you found what you like, find a specialized Corp over /r/evejobs or forum/ig/contacts and do what you like.
---
Most important, ask questions.
---
does choosing empire to explore matter at all. which one is the best to pick
---
That's why I don't fly one even though I have all the skills maxed out.  Too much anxiety.  I've finally worked up the balls to welp 100mil+ ships, but not a JF.  I'll get there eventually...
---
Yeah there's no way anything like that could be abused
---
I thought TRI was renting from NC and not INIT
---
T H I C C
---
Eve is one of those games that you are always learning something new.
---
FC, I prefer my thumb up my nostril, what do?
---
nope, you can inevitably train whatever you want, regardless of the empire you choose
---
Well technically 10, but I didn't play much until about 7 years ago because I didn't have a PC that could run Eve acceptably.
---
Lasker you have Reddit???? I love your channel, I watch your dread fights over and over! 
---
Nice. I'll already be in DC on Saturday, probably will stop by.
---
Nope, empire doesn't matter- unless you're really into lore / roleplaying. Choosing an empire lets you fly their frigate faster- but that's it. Literally, i chose my character based on how cool it looks :) It doesn't stop you from doing anything in game.
---
I'm sorry you didn't choose a Rhea or an ark.
---
I do have reddit. Thank you very much, I am glad you enjoy!
---
I played for about 13 years and I still don't understand all of Eve.
---
gr8, another carebear turned risk-averse-pvper. just what the game needs...
---
I
---
So a relatively new-player wanting to learn PvP is bad?
---
Got a link? Pretty sure that isn't me. My life is far from that exciting.
---
First thing I would say is dont get discouraged. 99.99% of players in this game have been completely lost at some point, so your not alone and everybody can relate to your struggles.
---
As others have mentioned do some homework on the type of activities you can do. Pick something that sounds interesting at start gearing your skill queue towards that goal.
---
Dont be afraid to try something once and realise you dont like it. You will probably go through multiple phases of trial and error until you find somthing you enjoy doing.
---
*said w/mustache* We work hard. We play hard.
---
*everybody dance now!...*
---
Variety?
---
If you think they're OP, start using them yourself then.
---
They just changed the size so you can’t save them all.  That’s probably good enough at this point.
---
The rorq is losing almost 50% of its active tank in April and a couple minutes off of PANIC. These are loot pinatas waiting to happen. Your cap umbrella has to be ready to go to even have a hope of saving it against a competent fleet.
---
Also, squeeze mining Rokh between the Venture and the Barge.
---
It can also lead to the titan spinning and bumping the rest of the fleet away from it, which could fuck up the attempt to bridge if jumping directly into combat.
---
Tried. Too low ehp :(
---
Uhh yeah. Don't go over the highsec highway during rush hour. It gets ya killed. 
---
What makes you think there aren't bots in real life also? You think that is air you are breathing? You could be a floating bot in a vat and you wouldn't even know it because of how clear the super-simulation that reality is.
---
But you are paying for that exceptionalism. Its at least 5 bil for the drones and 2+ bil for the hull. You are in 7 bil and that is without the fit which usually have deadspace modules on them for defense. Why does no one ever consider this? Your Rorqual costs a little more than half of a supercarrier and the one bil drones can be killed easier than a frigate.
---
AKA PIRAT.
---
Directly adressing our lord and master? How rude!
---
Weebs fuck off. 
---
I was actually looking into that, and it looks soooo fun. I wouldn't know where to start or what ship to fly though
---
I honestly have no frame of reference for why a lot of you seem to dislike the guy who got killed while undocking. Regardless, the sheer amount of salt in this thread (from one person getting killed) makes it obvious he's upset the majority of you.
---
I'd imagine most of you read comments about the guy, or hear things in game about him, then choose to hop aboard the screech train as soon as it's convenient for you. I don't give a shit what you might say about RMTs or his personality. This group think shit happens in so many games, and its bothersome that most of you probably just enjoy the drama. 
---
That's the point.  He is able to shoot at CODE ships, which he enjoys doing.  He thinks of it as a race between him and CONCORD to score the kill.
---
Pornmaker welcomes you
---
so you think children should be assraped for life, nice opinion bro, i am sure it is not you who should be locked up
---
I lost mine to a super on undock because I picked up my coffee after starting align so did not redock in time. 
---
Don't drink and jump.
---
It’s a well known fact that the more ISK you lose, the better you are. Buy as much plex as possible, load it all into a single T1 hauler, and fly it around Jita until it gets blown up. 
---

Word is when you fit that thing with full tank it's unkillable in highsec and you can just autopilot everywhere.

clear report of pirat running away from a fight, evidence that all they do is piss on a stream of velators undocking from jita 4.4
---
your conclusions are firmly grounded in reality ***and not in salt over losing something expensive to them like a dumbass*** ***one time***, to be certain
---
ps link the lossmail plz
---
Next step is finding a ratting vexor with his mtu out leaving and timing it just right to jump in and warp to his mtu to catch him.  Would recommend you use something a little more sturdy than the astero for this but that is great fun and takes some talent and a little luck.
---
You can always load new fighters. 
---
This is really awful, please delete it.
---
I loved the absent heroes one on rifter.
---
Not sure where they come from, apart from getting them on the market obviously.
---
Live in Lincoln these days, since I can't make the London one anymore may as well. 
---
&gt;What 30 man-comp would you take in subcaps to take out 2 nags, an apostle, bhaalgorn and vindi, if you have no planning time but you have to react immediately, which means you have to have your stuff ready from the start.
---
1 rook and 1 bifrost and 1 dps ship and a few logi ships
---
Would be rude not too. More of us here than I thought there would be. 
---
Congrats on the kill!  Nothing like the feeling of adrenaline coming out of your ears. Cloaky hunting is a fun stalking game.  I have been doing it for a few years and still enjoy it.

I didn't know VIRUS were INIT renters, thanks for letting me know
---
I'm not dissing them for what they are - they're cool guys and I've flown with them on at least one occasion - I'm just stating I expected more skilled play and all I witnessed was a batphone, when - as stated somewhere in the comments here - there were other, more interesting ways to deal with the comp, especially since they had no reinforcements coming up. I guess you can agree with that, right? 
---
See you next year in Jita 🤤
---
So it's a type of snake?
---
As a dinobrain and your sworn enemy, well done! PIRAT can go fuck themselves. Fucking GOP-STOP and their botting Nyxes in KWG. The day I might respect them is the day that PIRAT leadership is getting banned. 
---
I think you can cargo scan it to see if it has fighters in its hold
---
ITS COMIN RIGHT AT US!!!!
---
Yeah you are responsible, it's kind of legit when making tons of money by renting space. Put a blue alt in your renting lands and be a responsible landlord, when you find some botting corp, don't cash in and kick them asap. (I don't know how GSF handle these cases though)
---

---
Sir, you wound me ~~a bit like CONCORD~~
---
Every now and then when im back from a break from eve-online, every time i go out solo, i get that shakes, doesn't matter what your target is or what you are flying.
---
I love it, one of the reasons i absolutely love this game.
---
keep up the good work, keep killing!
---
the damp/ecm + webs or a skilled boosher wing would've done the trick too. Sometimes you get the hard counter and that's that - you're outplayed. Unless you light the batsignal. 
---
&gt; Oh, really? We're responsible for policing our members in space? Are we getting a slice of CCP's security budget, then?
---
You know what.  I'll police everybody.  Just give me the rights to ban people.   And while you are at it , give me one of those sweet Polaris ships and the skills to go with it. And you know , I'll be really busy policing people, so won't be able to go to work , so how about you pay my salary.
---
&gt;and the police did an investigation on it. and he didn't get some form of punishment, then he is clean
---
OJ Simpson would like a word with you.  
---
Not really. They're just (one of) the worst abusers of a fairly atrocious system. There's been plenty of other highsec elite "pvp" alliances before, and they've all basically made it their mission to depopulate highsec of new players. There's a reason why new player alliances tend to all live in nullsec/lowsec and it's not because of the sweet mechanics of highsec wardecs.
---
tactical
---
tactile is of or relating to touch

I d love indie-hulls in pirate-versions. Revamped for combat and plundering

wtf lol.... i guess i need to login my scout now :P

Nah, you need the gsm to be unbannable
---
Only cowards run from a mistake.
---
No such thing as overkill 
---
yeah, it was a 3am typo. 
---
yeah thats the point of this post, to show that you can save them all if you realy try, even after ccp changeing the size of them to make it so you cant save them all in 1 depo
---
but like alot of ppl have pointed out almoste noone will use 2 depos to do it
---
Welcome to the club, if you want to talk JF shop im happy to help.
---
We aren't making any money by renting space. We don't even have an operational renter organization yet. And even when we do, we're explicitly cutting the price to the bone in an attempt to force all the other rental organizations out of business. Or, at least, impact their bottom line.
---
And even if we did have, say, eleven regions being rented out, we *still* wouldn't be responsible for it. The whole idea is just silly.
---
"Every renter region"
---
How does that not include gotg, panfam and legacy?
---
Well its a good thing he picked the anshar, that one has a chance to survive... my nomad... not so much.
---
I always thought sec status penalties should be for high sec only.  
---
&gt; Just don't make me move to Dublin or London
---
This shit ain't no joke. Somewhat unrelated, but when CCP was doing their third party dev roundtable and pimped their open position for their API team, their list of technologies was identical, word for word, for what I do at work right now. However, I know that they would want me to relocate, so no dice. This is 2019, the internet exists, working remotely is a thing.
---
Nope
---
&gt;That's when you refit your 30 subs to damps in the mids and bring 2 web lokis to just completely disable both subs (Bhaal+Vindi)...
---
It does not work like that my dude. First, there is a thing called stacking penalties, so refitting 30 subcaps to damps is not much better than refitting just 3 of them. Second, even with multiple bonused Lachesis damps (either range or scanres)  you can't damp the battleships hard enough to take them out of this fight. You are on to something though when you suggested e-war, keep working on the problem.
---
They could engage FRT and even beat them, based on the huge number of supers/titans they have to work with. But it would involve Vily or Progod risking TEST supers/titans. Progod might manage to snitch the keys while mom and dad weren't watching, but it would probably be a disaster. Vily simply won't, because he still has the same risk averse mentality that he had when he was FCing goons years ago. 
---
It helps to explain why he (Vily) got so salty when SNUFF killed a single TEST titan, because he believes he's owed risk free supercap content, regardless of any reality on the ground. (SNUFF being neutral to TEST for example)
---
I look forward to CCP clarifying how any other player is responsible for other players cheating.
---
hear, hear! ccp + csm please take note the players have had enough of this nonconsensual PVP. it not only makes the victims but also the aggressor feel bad. you need to implement a method of explicitly giving consent to PVP either that or give players a bubble spell so they can hearthstone back to the inn safely if someone tries to bully them
---
Ah, I was waiting for the "that's not real communism!" argument.
---
It's 100% irrelevant what your naive and infantile mind believe real communism to be. What it has evolved into several times in history is the standard, and those countries (Russia, China, various south american and asian countries) hold the record by orders of magnitude on slaughtering their own populace.
---
We were attempting to jump off the battleships.  They had a scram chain between them and the Damnation, which made it very hard to do so.  We managed to jam out the chain a few times, and eventually did kill the Vidicator by jumping it off.
---
In our first encounter with them they were actually scramming the Vindi with one of the caps, which limited their range but made it impossible to jump off.
---
Your comment downvoted as requested!
---
Fair point 
---
SoCT took over the remaining Jove corporations and the Jovian Directorate seat in the CONCORD Inner Circle. They have access to at least some of their technology, and they are the guys who give out Gnosises, Praxises and the sort. Skill injectors were also lorewise introduced by SoCT afaik.
---
[The EVE lore site](https://fiction.eveonline.com/tags/jove) has a number of informative texts on Jove alongside many other things, and the chronicle Inheritance tells about the whole succession deal.  As someone moderately interested in lore, it was a bit of a tiresome read, but I did enjoy it. IIrc it is followed up by Sine Wave Alpha and Sine Wave Omega.
---
So you are claiming they don’t have any bots?
---
yeah. or just removed since this game is way too safe anyway
---
gj
---
Well, if alliances don't want to police their renting space, they shouldn't be asking any isk to people who want to live there don't you think? If you rent these lands, you're accountable for what happen there, there's some logic behind the quote from ccp imo.
---
anshar sucks

No where in my comment did I say anything along the lines of “they don’t have any bots?”

---
Whatever you plan on using it for test on sisi first, even simple things like cyno placement on structures. Its a lot to lose especially when you have cargo on board as well
---
Nope, not even a little. That's dumb reasoning. CCP already takes care of the money angle by negwalleting the corporation that gets the ratting taxes from a botter anyways.
---
Ok so first off welcome to eve! I am a habitual new player (keep coming back trying to remain hooked)
---
First piece advice i can give you is take it slow, like real slow. Dont look at a big shiny ship and say i want to fly that next week. You will regret it i promise you.
---
Reading through some of your responses to comments has been you "understanding" the game. Believe these people when they say they have been playing for YEARS and dont understand all of the game. Some people dont even touch some of the aspects of the game for the years they play. Again take it slow, learn what you like in the game or get an idea of what you want to do.
---
Take risks, in the end the ship your flying at basically any point your gonna lose, its just a simple fact. But there is an importent rule when playing eve, and thats dont fly what you cannot afford to replace. Live by this rule, in your ship fitting screen on the bottom left it will say the total value of your rig. If you dont have this much or more in your wallet, dont undock, and if you do undock and lose it, learn from your mistake.
---
Again im still very new and learn something new every time i try to play and really hoping i can stick around, find a new player corp willing to help you learn. But mostly just play the game, take it slow and you will learn how deep you can get into this.
---
Feel free to message me in game. My name in game is Argona Momaki
---
Goons is an entire corp full of bots, if I'm remembering right.
---
So basically all of eve will be one big red spot?
---
You should send him an in game mail.
---
You calling my dad a coward? You’re absolutely right

1v1 is kinda fun but it's too bad SP plays a big role in it, and when you add expensive implants on top of that it really becomes is a find a "lower SP/isk player" or fly a counter to their fit. Fuck ups are common but a day of fights ease them away quickly.
---
god bless

Not responsible for the cheating, but responsible for the activities taking place in your sovereign space. You as owner should be motivated to govern, with positive or negative stimulants. If you don't want that responsibility, don't take sovereignty.
---
Lol I get it
---
You are one of the nullbloc elitists who qualifies his PvP. The wardec corps don't need to respond to your request for an honor brawl to prove themselves. They've already got what they want. There's no shame in going after low-hanging fruit. 
---
If you've met some of EVE's highsec residents you'll find they're desperately in need of some percussive education about how EVE works. They've got weird ideas about e.honor, are disingenuous and passive-aggressive, feel entitled to safety and are quick to claim victimhood. We should be grateful that highsec PvPers exist to apply a boot to the ass and remind them that this is EVE. Remember, they're improving your recruiting pool.
---
Ok so you are implying they do have bots?
---
Ironically there play style is like the least harmed by the wardec rework of all the highsec pvp play styles. 
---
In high sec ? 
---
Yep, and where did those botters find the isk to pay their rent? Does this payment get erased as well when ccp finds out about a botting corp? (Honest question)
---
Fuck you for telling me what to do. 
---
U suck.

Isn’t the corporation window really buggy? I had bad experience with it when I first started. I think he’s better off visiting the evejobs subreddit

The most fun I have in eve is just trying to see what I can get away with risk-wise. Trying to figure out how to do things with a restricted skillset or budget is as much fun as with max skills and unlimited money. Just don't forget that, and if you're doing something that isn't fun, do something else. :)

The truth is, you don't have an idea what you are talking about, in your own words, both on the gaming and metagaming, but you've posted a wall of nonsense about moral high grounds and whatever. 
---
Since you get a passing grade for effort, I will help you a bit with the substance. 
---
Spearfishing: how do you think some of the battleships were killed to start with? Also, their subcaps maintain a scram chain, so they can't be booshed most of the time unless something else happens. Check the battle report.
---
Moral ground: in this game when ships are in space and baiting in their system, they get killed one way or another. The ruskies dudes stayed on grid because they had nowhere to go, could not log off, could not dock to a structure, nor warp to a POS. One Damnation ran away, it was not a big deal so people did not bother to chase.

---
I don't know why you're posting 1 BR to a fleet fight as an argument against what this group does the other 99% of their time logged into the game.  
---
My opinion on PIRAT and other wardec based corps is formed from playing this game for 15 goddamn years and dealing with like 50 different versions of their corp.   
---
The only salt here is how salty I am over the wardec corp playstyle literally being bad for Eve Online in the long run; it literally repels new players. Like the CCP stats showed, these corps' members almost always stop logging in when these bottomfeeders activate their 500th active wardec on their shitty highsec mission running corp.
---
Dude's more of a CODE fanboy than anything else.
---
K so I have to ask....were you actually mad at the bat phone blob or was it just sarcasm 
---
In this case I think SP plays a big roll because I am turning the fight into a raw stats contest, in a hull that is not really designed to do that. Far more often fights get settled on player skill rather than character skill. 
---
I do fly with people from time to time, although I find it's often harder to get good fights (less duo pairs roaming around then solo).
---
I am really glad you enjoy the content!
---
Its always easy to reflect on misakes afterwards, the adrenaline rush of some engagements causes the brain to turn off and mistakes to happen. (why did i fly directly at a muninn fleet in my crow to get a critical tackle on a boosher instead of spirialing... rip).
---
Plus, it was a voltron fleet, alot of newbro's who don't have alot of experience.
---
Test finally starts turning the tables on winterco. Good to see they're putting up a fight. 
---
Hey, welcome to the family!
---
Yeah, this game is super hard to figure out at first, but the pay off (when you do figure it out) is worth the effort.
---
First things first, you control your ship and interact with stuff by clicking in space or by using the right click menu on items in your overview (the big built in spreadsheet on the right side of your screen). 
---
The default overview is total shit, ask someone in the new player help channel to get you a link to "Z-S Overview" or the "Sarashawa Overview". You can use those to make your overview easier to read, which will make it a lot easier to understand.
---
Make sure to do the starter missions, and when you're done with those I suggest also doing the Sisters of Eve "Bloodstained Stars" missions too (you can find a walk through on google). This missions will teach you a ton about the core mechanics, so don't skip them. 
---
After that go find a new player friendly corp to join. Brand Newbros, Eve Uni, Brave, Karmafleet, etc. Eve is a game best played with other people, especially when they're also learning the mechanics with you. 
---
It's easy to get into, yes. Standings don't matter as much wne you live in lowsec (where faction warfare is conducted). Check out these guise, newbros welcome:

PIRAT *is* a highsec carebear corp.  They're more risk adverse than your average mission runner.

True lol

Try eve o preview too

Look its fit
---
What? Get gud.  Literally one of the few skills left that shows the good hunters from the chaffe.
---
It makes it so they no longer melted anything nearby, it still takes 30-40k DPS minimum to break one of those caps.  We had three dreads on them the previous time and it still took 2 hours to kill them.  It simply takes more damage to break a well fit cap in w-space than most corps can bring on their own, and even those that can need a max CTA level form up.
---
Would I prefer we had killed them alone? Sure. Is our slack AAR channel filled with ideas on what to do better next time? Absolutely. Are we going to drop tackle and just wave in local for the next random PvP cap we find if we grab one and can't take it alone? No.
---
Well apparently you dont remember very well at all or you are a cute newbie.

To be fair, it did have a bunch of big hairy eyes

It's so weird.  I'm pretty damn sure you're speaking english, I recognized every word you said, yet somehow I dont have a god damned clue what you're talking about.

No, PIRAT is a PvP corp. #33 alltime rank according to zkill.

Carebears say stuff like:

&gt; Even in video games, virtual aggression is harmful, and corrupts those who partake.
---
Definitely made the right call to win the fight imo. as fun as it was watching 5 guys take on a heavy armor fleet I get why you did what you did. Good on you 
---
Okok well then i give you credit, it's not that much of a problem if every isk generated with botting goes to the trashcan
---
If I had to guess, now that alpha clones can't do level 4 missions anymore, I'd imagine that they have been lowered somewhat.
---
That or they simply PLEX the accounts now?
---
MY SPOD! *snipping of crab claws*

Definitely.  Some ships really get a disproportionate amount of skins, and the Sansha ships are certainly among the most overdue.

Keeping my fingers crossed that something comes out of them factoring heavily into this new Triglavian whatever that's on the horizon.

*Evil laughter*

Shit I've never been killed by any high sec gankers, I couldn't imagine that it'd be that big of a deal. If they think they are "mining salt" from players that's pretty sad and shows how worthelss their existence is! It's sad really. It's just nice CCP is going to fuck up their playstyle sooner than later lol
---
Absolutely, I wish this became the new meta because I wanna attempt some rorqual heists.

I'm not worried about who you think I am and you're dead wrong if you think me or anyone with a brain cares about the spacetrash that swarm into goons' masterful fully automated luxury gay space communism model. They will firmly shake themselves out of goons and into the nearest ~~trash can~~ renter corp the moment it seems a war isn't going our way.  
---
The wardec corp playstyle is an ancient abuse of a shitty wardec system that was never fixed. It's partly responsible for Eve's bad player retention, and that really sucks for all of us.   
---
Your opinion on highsec PVPers is spot-on though but can they please go through the wringer in some other way than some corp with \_more active wardecs than members\_ forever stomping their lone noobs and dumbos in Jita and Amarr through a wardec that can't be ended or resolved?

I would suggest the starter missions to get a feel for the interface.   Some of the material is dated but there are a lot of YouTube videos. Those helped me a lot.   And join a Corp that’s friendly to new people.   Also when you do don’t be surprised or offended if they ask you a lot of questions.    You might be a spy after all.

Awesome this may be exactly what I’m looking for!! Is this a Corp that you are involved in?

FW is a really good way to get into PvP! Lowsec FW is where solo/small gang warfare thrives. You can fit up a cheap t1 frigate/destroyer/cruiser and go find a fight within minutes. A huge bonus if you don’t find a fight - you can sit inside the complexes running down a timer, and at the end of the timer if you don’t get a fight you get LP! 
---
As for finding groups - the militia chat + running around the warzone. Pick which faction you’re interested in and get right into it and you’ll find people to fly with pretty quickly. FW is the one place where you’ll end up in a lot of random fleets just by running into other people in your faction doing the same thing you’re doing. Also the fleet finder - look for militia fleets! 
---
You should add your in game name to your post.
---
Eve as a whole is oddly kind to it's new pilots. We'll blow your ship up, but as long as you don't respond with hate and discontent you'll probably get some tips on why you died/how to avoid it, and sometimes enough ISK to cover your loss.
---
Nicely explained 
---
Another alt Transfers the loot in the fleet Hangar of a dst. The other alt becomes suspect but Not the pilot of the transport Shop. If this still works..
---
oh for sure, just at a lower rate per capita than the main ones.  jealous krabs  will steam any fellow krab they think is botting and competing for resources.
---
and... it’s gone.
---
and? some stupid fit with capital drone mining augmentor
---
OP do not become friends with this guy he is a hi-sec(high security) ganker and he will betray you!
---
edit: wait nvm it’s Jamal he ain’t bumping shit
---
Just look at the mer and see where most botting occurs. It's like a map that's(still) published monthly
---
The correct line is "there is no dominix" my dude.
---
If you a brand new, I would look into exploration ships. A lot of groups will take you as a day 1 pilot if you are willing to scan. It is kind of grunt work, but its also an important skill for living in wormholes, and you can run relic sites in it to make very good money for a beginner. As you train up, t3 cruisers are generally the workhorse of most WH groups, so I would look at those for long term goals. (Loki/Legion/Tengu/Proteus, in approximate order of their demand)
---
Grats on the JF, sorry for your loss on not picking the sexiest ship in Eve, the Ark. Also, JF's will change your life.

Once their cap comp trickled in and set up on grid it was 100% committed. Maybe they could have jumped one cap out and collapse the hole behind it, but it would have gotten tackled on the other side.
---
They could also release a list of all banned in-game names so we could verify if they are actually doing shit.
---
Mainly cause the heat map would have like 3 tiny spots. 
---
Ccp makes a token effort to stop botting. 
---
Want proof? Find a bot and report it. Come back days/weeks/months later and the bot will still be cruising along.
---
Lowsec FW is where solo/small gang warfare use to thrive.

So by “dense” you are saying they have a lot more than one would think?

The fact that PIRAT was able to abuse less educated players for so long is probably CCP's greatest fuckup.  
---
They've literally lost thousands of subscribers whom, given more time to learn, would still be playing.  When i first started our corp purposely retreated to a hisec pocket to evade that kind of bullshit.

So for every new member it was our responsibility to teach people how to get there safely and avoid the main sources of grief.

They wouldn't need hundred of active wardecs if it weren't for the lame mechanics enabling wardec evasion. In ancient history dissolving your corp and re-forming *sans* 'dec was an exploit, but even then you could freely drop corp and wait out the war. Now every corp has a war-immune mirror corp for shelter. Gotta cast a wide net to catch anything.
---
It's fine to disagree with the mechanics. I take issue with this thread's theme of hating the player instead of the game. PIRAT today, CODE. tomorrow, Goons next week. We're all in this together.
---
Am also curious, did the nerf to require aggressors to maintain a structure not make it possible to end these wars?

So you're using the XML export to import it into your fittings within eve.
---
Much easier way of doing that. Make sure you link your eve character to pyfa if you haven't already via the EVE SSO menu. Once you do, you will be able to open a fit, go to EVE SSO &gt; export fitting, and select the character to export to. When you do this, the fit will automatically show up in the eve client under your fittings.

Figure that’s maybe 15x15cm, so 0.0225 of a cubic meter of spod? At 10bln for 0.0225, you’re looking at 444bln ISK per cubic meter? I haven’t checked Jita prices in a while, but I feel like I can probably get a better deal than that.

who cares about winning the isk war by barely 1b and still losing the field, if you think losing the isk war is what makes people not want to engage snuff i got a bridge to sell ya
---
This is indeed wrong but i take a look and change this soon
---
But is he wrong? As a new player I also wanted to learn how to pvp and everyone suggested FW, it seems that most of those people haven’t been there in a while.
---
First I tried to find an active FW Corp, that was unsuccessful. I decided to join the militia and roam around a bit, did that for about 2 days and managed to get into about 5 fights.  LP bots just warping off or a bunch of people just docked up in each system.
---
Nullsec seems way easier to find a fight tbh from my personal experience at least.

There may be some systems during certain times of the day that are active but I wouldn't expect much 1v1
---
It’s imitating a rorq fit
---
Clearly that's why they considered disengaging?
---
Using warp core stabs turns this comp into some kind of MJDing battleship. If you play safe vs it - it gets out. If you risk and go in to keep it in place - you can get scrammed, grappled, neuted and feed something.
---
So imo it's worth to have WCS so you can warp around just to force opposing fleet to think that you can get out, even if you actually cannot. But still it's open qiestion if they could or couldn't. 
---
no idea, haven't looked at it myself in a while! I know CCP did some revamps to it at some point here, though. but yeah, there are other ways to find a corp as well!
---
Possibly during your time yeah sure, but around black rise at least I didn’t find much content honestly.
---
But thanks for the idea though, my home is not far away from bleak lands so I’ll pass by to check it out :)

Whether a wardec corp has 50 or 500 wardecs isn't the point here and I'm not even gonna pretend to know all the ways highsec people use to avoid being bullied by these corps.    
---
PIRAT are the current face of their playstyle and it's very apparent that they neither get or deserve any respect ingame, due to how they choose to play the game. And you got the wrong guy to try the "today us, tomorrow you" line on, what with goons being *almost* as universally hated.  
---
We'll have to see how the war HQ change affects wardec corps because this game ruining shitshow has gone enough long enough and the nerf sledgehammer is long overdue.
---
There are plenty of times I’ve fought and lost the field and still considered it a win. So yes this is yet another reason for folks to engage snuff.

It used to be really great place to learn basics in pvp and finding veteran pvp players to teach you tricks. Currently not sure. It's kinda lacking any "end game" content so you might have hard time finding the actually good pilots there. It's just endless novice plexes and extremely grindy system capture mechanics. Even more grindy than sov wanding without much benefits.

It assumes your ship is spinning and every time you are facing directly at the target the weapon fires. Thus by taking the number of radians in a circle and dividing it by your rate of fire in rad/s you get the number of seconds in between shots.

Possibly nobody would like it indeed. But there's more stuff people don't like in a game like EVE. Especially established bittervets...

Concern/question: The 'Item Damage' row doesn't give a clear interpretation of how badly damaged the various enemies really are (in the case of things like the Leshaks and the Drifter Battleships, all of which spawn critically damaged). Is there any way to get around this?
---
Concern/question 2: For the Sleeper ships who use missiles, what do the various 1%/2% "Bonus" rows represent?  
---
Inconsistency: Various NPCs seem to have either 0% resists on their Structure, or 100% resists on their Structure. It should probably be 0% for most of them, maybe there's a floating point oddity somewhere?

Order thing: The Blastneedle Tessella is split apart from the other three (with the four EWar ones in between). To that point it might be preferable to push the four EWar Tessellas over to the right, so that the order goes \_\_\_\_needle Tessella, \_\_\_\_lance Tessella, \[EWAR\] Tessella

Ah,  oh... I'm not a rorq specialist :/
---
Me either. But it’s ok bud 
---
I was thinking 'den of stinking evil' from baldurs gate
---
Late replys for the win xD
---
Just know the loot is super inconsistent. Some cans will barely be worth 100K ISK and some can be close to billions apparently
---
god I wish I could fit one of those up my ass
---
Good, if you kill all docked players you receive 1 SP.
---
1DQ
---
The best way I've seen EVE described is that it's more of a hobby than just a game. I would put it in the same league as classic tabeltop games that are considered hobbies, like MtG or Warhammer, than with most video games.
---
&gt; But is he wrong? As a new player I also wanted to learn how to pvp and everyone suggested FW, it seems that most of those people haven’t been there in a while.
---
Sadly, not wrong. Black Rise was still an extremely active area solo/small-gang pvp up until about six months ago. Then the largest, most-active Caldari alliances quit. I suspect due to the combination of GalMill being dominant for too long and the presence of Snuff being too oppressive. Shortly after the major GalMil alliances having nobody to shoot also left the warzone. 
---
I think the warzone has rebounded just a little, Saltfarmers joined Caldari FW and along with others are slowly pushing back the warzone. On the GalMil side GMVA stuck it out and is still active, it feels like with at least a few FW groups left to shoot at some of the smaller pirate groups have returned for the good fights... Still it's a lot harder to find fights than it once was.
---
HIEETA 😂
---
I wish fleet formations were a thing in this game.  
---
Formations like:  
---
\- An X shape formation (vertical or horizontal, whichever you want).  
---
\- A rectangular shaped wall formation (like a \[=======\] facing the enemy).  
---
\- A sphere shaped formation (similar to how we already get into while in fleet warp).  
---
If anyone's played Star Trek: Armada 2 (or 1), then you know what I'm talking about.  
---
Oh well.
---
weeeeeeeeeeb
---
&gt; One single ding alert when passing -2.0 would allow a single point in which a player can make a concious decision to continue their glorious criminal behavior or take action to fix it. If they lose their ship after that, they were warned. 
---
*ding*
---
Here's your alert. Use it wisely.
---
Hi, the day will kick off at 14:00 in The Square Sail, Brayford Wharf, LN1 1YW. There is no car parking at most of the city centre bars. I have checked the city council parking ([https://www.lincoln.gov.uk/resident/parking-transport-and-travel/parking/motorhome-parking/](https://www.lincoln.gov.uk/resident/parking-transport-and-travel/parking/motorhome-parking/)) and they don't allow you to sleep in your camper overnight. Hartsholme Country Park has camper van facilities and is a short bus / taxi journey from the city centre, this might be your best bet. 
---
Hehehe very nice
---
I'd relocate to Iceland for an economist position (if they even had one, or hell, even doing what Ghost does now) only if I got a COLA along with my salary.
---
NUT
---
Follow the tutorial.  Do all of it.  Do the career tutorials, too.
---
When I started, there were no tutorials!  I was unceremoniously dumped into space near an asteroid with an orbiting red '+', and I'm still here iver 10 years later.
---
Eve University has a daunting application process, but is highly recommended.
---
I've also heard nothing but praise for Brand Newbros.
---
fun story, i was in the corp that forat started Templis Calsf bqck then. dunno what they are up to now a days though
---
Golden rules. 
---
1. Its probably a scam.                
---
           
---
2. You lose everything in the ship when you die, don’t undock in things you cant afford/cope with losing.               
---
             
---
3. If you’re enjoying it then you are doing it right if you’re not, try something else its a big game.           
---
               
---
4. Don’t be afraid to  ask questions.             
---
              
---
5. If you’re about to try something new where it going wrong will cost you most of your net worth, consider firing up the test server and get some free experience (everything is 100isk on the test server)
---
Rakanishu!
---
hi im girl. but yeah thanks anyways this game looks very hard to understand 
---
Lol @ hk calling out anyone for anything every 
---
On both accounts, same advert https://imgur.com/gallery/zT4kO8C
---
Report the ad, they don't pick what ads you get to see.
---
you should stop searching for ISK sellers
---
im still doing the research investigation mission and traveling around and killing other enemy ships. im getting good coins and loyality points but i dont know what to do with them.  where can i find the missions that show me the core mechanics because so far all missions is about blowing shit up
---
That’s not how ads work. 
---
You do realise the reason these appear is because you search for/browse these rmt sites?
---
where is eve university?. what is it?  where can i find the tutorials. i only find missions and currently doing research investigators one. but i dont think thats a tutorial because all im doing is just fighting 
---
Is that the fabled Goon cum crystal? 
---
Do exploration instead. It’s on your own time. Cheaper to get into. And you don’t have to listen to people speech out on coms. 
---
if i dont waant to lose items is their way to store them before undocking. + i dont have anything to lose my inventory is just empty 
---
But can I rent a C6?
---
Shut up rock
---
Most of the incursion communities have specific fits they are looking for noobs to fly. Once you pick which community you want to fly with you can check their website or in-game channel for the fits they want. 
---
&gt; you can spot it. Medium-ish ratting numb
---
I wonder if it would be possible (without refreshing every hour) to het hourly NPC kills over a day or week period. That would be a damned nice filter.
---
god damnit now i have to quit eve and play D2
---
im still flying a starter ship. i dont know how do you lose stuff. btw what are the things do you even lose? just your ship, because my inventory is always empty what do you usaully fill it??. 
---
also where is the store?, how do i upgrade my ship or buy new weapons or a new spaceship
---
Just leave it in the station hanger 
---
You should probably spending some time looking into how websites serve up advertisements because you try to throw around accusations. Zkillboard is simply tying into an Ad platform that's serving up their own content based on your browsing history. Zkillboard has very little involvement with the type of advertisements much less specific ads. Report the ad and move on. Don't try to make drama where their isn't any.
---
is their an ingame vc?
---
i want to have star wars type of shit :3
---
I think [this](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/12/21/closeted-gay-guy-cant-understand-why-he-sees-really-gay-targeted-ads-on-facebook/) might be relevant.
---
I take the health of the game into consideration.
---
&gt;You already have a cyno jam system, use it.
---
The fact is that people drop carriers on cruisers. Where is the cyno jam system when that happens?
---
Jita
---
whats station hanger? also when you logout does your spaceship disappear ??
---
&gt; 8 hrs a day is probably a bot.
---
I know real people who absolutely seem to be online 12+ hours a day.
---
That would be exactly what Im looking for, thank you!! Im over in MA
---
wait so i choosed a school and now im trapped in the same solar system ??? 
---
The only way I could see this working without giving the FC control of all ships in the fleet would be a button simillar to aproach but instead of aproaching the FC it would aproach a point in the formation. I don't realy see a point in getting this into the game besides novilty.
---
Just mix it with heroin and inject like a normal person, jeez.
---
You're as stupid as a bag of hair. You clearly have no idea how ads work.
---
Outrageous! Truly, truly outrageous...
---
Oh boy. 
---
From their Wiki:
---
"**What is EVE University**
---
	
---
EVE University is a corporation in EVE Online and a member of the Ivy League Alliance. We are a neutral, non-profit training corporation in New Eden. Founded in March of 2004 by Morning Maniac, EVE University continues to take new pilots and train them in all aspects of EVE Online.
---
As well as the UniWiki, EVE University runs classes on various subjects, the majority of which are open to the public both live and in our Class Library. Our calendar has details of our upcoming classes and other events.
---
EVE University accepts applications from anyone, regardless of SP, who wants to learn more about EVE Online. We are also interested to hear from those who would like to teach or provide content for our members. See our page on [Applying to EVE University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University).
---
By becoming a member you gain access to our members-only resources, which include our Mentor Program, Corporation Hangars, Skillbook Reimbursement and +3 Implants Program. As a member you are also eligible to join our Campuses, through which you can experience life in high sec, low sec, null sec and wormholes, as well as incursions, Project Solitude and our mining campus."
---
With the amount of latitude we get in playing this game, I think abuse is the wrong word. If erroneous bot accusations lead to large alliances fail cascading, we'd still be entertained.
---
It's not abuse... It's content.
---
?
---
So you have the potential to lose everything you take out in space, the ship itself, gear on the ship, items in the ship. But these questions regarding where to buy and upgrade your ship are answered in the tutorials which you should be doing or have done. I promise if you just logged in and are “winging it” your gonna be in for a rough time.
---
Jitaa 
---
🙏🎊Congratulations 👉you👈 played🎮🎻 yourself 😫💯🙏

I'M SO EXCITED!!!

---
If you are doing the mission chain that started when you first spawned into the game I would finish that as that is the intro mission.  After that F11 will bring up the help menu and there should be a link there for the career agent missions.  These will introduce many of the core mechanics for fighting, exploration, industry, and markets.
---
cant find tutorial 
---
Ok so different reasons why people are mixed about FW but still good to know.
---
Google is currating ads for you based on your relevant search history.
---
Maybe stop searching RMT sites 
---
No.  There are stargates to move between systems.
---
Assumed there'd be a picture of me..
---
Dodged a bullet on that one I guess
---
Aura should start you on the tutorial on your first login.
---
I think you start in a pod, and she leads you to your ship, and other advtures after that.
---
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGzfw9JVwAAsf7D.jpg
---
Blessed pornmaker 
---
But the domi got no luvs...
---
Aura should have popped up a message box right when you logged on for the first time. I’m not sure how to get her back if you closed it but you can go to a space station in your system(should be in the overview box on the right side of your screen) and in there go to the agency tab and there will be some basic missions that will walk you through general gameplay. If your still having trouble maybe start a whole new character so Aura pops up and you follow her tutorial.
---
Fraternity did not kick RR for botting. lol RR left over other disagreements. There's no larger botting entity then frat.
---
That looks like one of WTM fits and yes it works fine. 
---
It's not the best of ships though and i highly recommend you upgrade to a Vindicator as soon as you can.
---
p.s. Train up your capskills asap that thing is a cap hungry beast.
---
Zhita
---
You are innocent until proven guilty. 
---
I’ve played for 6 months maybe and I still have no idea what I’m doing lol
---
That's a big stretch thinning as you know full well Frat places ratting bots in the rental program so Frat proper won't be accused/dinged for having ratting bots.
---
It's one thing to claim ignorance and say oh we don't police it. However, you do know because I have shown you while I ran that rental program. I have personally discussed it with you on comms who is directing the botting, where it is happening, and how the whole thing works. Stop playing dumb.
---
Not necessarily. If ur in space then ur ship doesn’t instantly disappear so... yeah, preferably don’t log-off in space
---
More like REEEEEEEEEEEEETAH
---
You clearly don't understand how ads work.
---
Zkill sells advertisemt space to the likes of google and other internet-ad companies who have nothing to do with EVE.
---
The ad-company then compares what it thinks your interests are (It does that by tracking your IP adres/using cookies on the sites you visit and the searches you did on search-engines) with possible ads it can show. It calculates for each ad how likely it thinks you are going to click it and then shows that ad.
---
It shows up for you because a computer/AI-who has no real concept of what EVE is- thinks that you are interested in buying isk.
---
Maybe you visited isk selling sites before?
---
system?
---
I get the same ads all the time
---
I managed to get a shit ton of exploration loot out of nullsec- somehow managed to escape a gatecamp lol
---
Lol nice bait
---
If you are in the ship you e warp to a spot in space and chill for a few mins before being removed from space. People can scan you down using combat probes so best to safe log whereby your ship is removed from space after 30 seconds                
---
In either case when you log in you warp back to roughly the spot you were in when you logged out
---
You shouldn't need to hit space because you shouldn't be warping before you're aligned.
---
True, will have to get over not knowing.  
---
Yeah I tried but only shows modules fit and any scripts.  
---
10 years of having renters, never had a single negwallet applied to either PL or NCdot so one of the core belief the collected whole of EVE believes is wrong.
---
Either PL and NCdots rental programs are bot free, or CCP doesn't neg wallet rental landlords after finding their bots in rental corps.  
---
13 trillion a year during its height, every penny accounted for (one of our old accounting reports was even an article on TMC.com because of its absurd level of accounting detail) and never a single negative wallet transaction from a CCP GM.
---
I’ll up the ante- 15 million or... a generous offer of a free eviction ;)
---
I see two ways: 
---
Let FC set fleet formation, and then give players a button that toggles free flight vs. "put me in the set formation"  
---
You enter formation upon fleet warp, much like how you currently shift into a ball, so you just enter the battlefield in a set formation.    
---
For the former, it would basically be a replacement for FCs yelling "Keep me at range X," or "Orbit me X" 
---
For the latter, the server basically does a calculation of "FC has set formation, there are 115 ships in fleet, they are arranged like this for a fleet of that formation of that size, whichever ship is closest to each point in the formation floats there while in warp."  I imagine this would potentially be turned off in high Ti-Di situations.
---
And there's only one guy in there who does omni damage. Rest do Kinetic and a few rare ones do Thermal.
---
Someone's been touched in a sensitive spot :)
---
Those are very good rules :)
---
You are very welcome! If you want to start a playthrough I'm down lol
---
If you enable cheating in any competition, you're ejected from that competition, this isn't some new fad or strange crazy idea.
---
Eve is a competition.
---
Now, you wont be, because lol CCP, but again, if you enable cheaters, in any competition, or any other scenario at all, you're punished and or ejected. 
---
Lets try not to play the wounded warrior who passes off all responsibility, you as well as any alliance that exists in 0.0 bear responsibility for allowing the cheating to go on, and you should be punished for it.
---
obviously yeeta
---
it's going to look so great instawarping off sites
---
only if you have clam chowder
---
I would love to have been watching a split screen view of what the pair of you were doing at the time. Screaming and mashing random buttons I'd guess?
---
hoarders woke up
---
*Wooosh*
---
You can only launch 3 lights 
---
Officially they left Black Rise [last August](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/98pf9j/templis_calsf_announces_they_are_leaving_black/) looking at their killboard it looks like a lot of them move out to Providence? They're still in Caldari militia and I see some CALSF guys out and about in the war zone but not as many as I used to.
---
It can be, for sure! It really does make a massive difference to have someone walk you through at least the basics. Most folks in eve are very friendly to new players, so don't ever be afraid to ask questions. Also, joining a corporation will get you in to dedicated channels where people are much more likely to see and answer your questions :)
---
Really hope you stick around, this game is tough but definitely worth it!
---
That is not entirely correct. Yes the Ads are focused on your interests but its more likely he sees these adds as they are under the same keyword "eve" or something like that than the website. 
---
Beacons are loss mail generators
---
##WHAT AM I GONNA DO??
---
Yeah, it's a good question. I've scoured the killmails and don't see any warp core stabs anywhere, so they definitely weren't carrying them. Honestly I think they were probably in it to either win, or die trying. As they pointed out in the video they had one or two points where they could have warped out and only lost one cap, but chose not to. 
---
The flip side is that potanumaumau is correct as well - they didn't have a citadel/pos in system, so they didn't particularly have anywhere to safe up, and we would occasionally tag each ship with a few missiles to prevent logoffs. We had combat scanners and sabres ready, and I was actually sort of hoping during the earlier stages of the fight that they would do that and separate their fleet up a bit, as it would have been easier to deal with that comp if it were split into two separate groups. 
---
My overall interpretation though is what he said in the video - they were in it until the end, whether that was until we retreated fully, or until we finally managed to kill them. And having 100 subcaps on grid sure made for a great Alamo-style ending to that video. This is basically how I see end of that fight: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcGQkfc6O8I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcGQkfc6O8I)
---
I feel like you are kind of overlooking all of the play of the game. In chess white goes first, but it's not a game about going first. Yes their are strong and weaker hulls, better and worse fits, more specialized fits, SP, implants, drugs, and all of those things matter, but you also have to fly your ship. 
---
People load the wrong ammo, burn out mods, fly in the wrong way, get to confident and engage too much, fail to leave when things go against them, etc. etc.
---
Yes, it was called rage lmao 
---
True, moving around nullsec you'll at least get a response out of poking ratters and miners.
---
&gt; whats station hanger?
---
All structures that you can dock your ship in have player hangars.
---
They may also have corporate hangars, if you belong to a player corp.
---
I like to merge the ship hangar and player hangar.  Their is a checkbox on the ESC &gt; General settings page (I think).
---
Your inventory is accessible from the [Neocom](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NeoCom), the bar of icons on the left of the screen.  There are two relevant buttons: 
---
* [Item hangar](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/e/e7/Itemhangar.png) shows current hangar.     
---
* [Personal Assets](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/images/9/92/Assets.png) shows all hangars everywhere.    
---
The salt you guys generate about this Marshy guy is hard to get a perfect refine on. I'm working on the skill but rank V is really a long train for this crazy nullsec-only salt ore.
---
It is! I started a calmil corp and we eventually merged into this group. Pannio is EUTZ heavy, but plenty of USTZ as well. And a couple AUTZ guise!
---
Amarr/min is now the place for fights since the active gal/Cal alliances have moved out of Black Rise
---
If nobody gets your joke/reference, maybe it's not funny/relevant
---
Minsc and Boo stand ready!
---
I'm new to politics, but I think Salt Farmers are Germans in Calmil yes, and CMC is probably Conglomerate or something. They sorta died out or are doing something else, and this corp is a spiritual successor, yeah
---
anddddd it's gone
---
CCP Ghost is painfully full of shit. I would hate to be in the same room with him. My ego is big, too and needs space.
---
YEETA
---
at least they finally removed the utter dogshit NPE he designed with his big brain
---
Be better for players to report it on a player built website and it generates a heat map
---
IChooseYou has dumped 580k of hoarded PLEX into the market at once .... just saying

Can you just search instead of asking a question that gets asked and answered almost every day? If you can't pull that off you should just go back to WoW or whatever. EVE isn't for everyone.
---
He's just memeing about you having a hard time in this game because you're a girl. Truth is, not all alliances are full of weird edgelords that will make you uncomfortable on comms (communication program you use to speak with your corporation, mostly Discord or TS).
---
Unrelated, but mentoring is an actual thing in the game. When I first started there was this veteran of the game that was bored and spent almost all his gaming time teaching me about the space we lived in (wormholes). But even if you don't find a sugar daddy like I did, most people in every corp are happy to teach newbies
---
was thinking the same .. left disappointed
---
Getting ready to roll a hole 4 Mega's on standby, Domi shows up in the static.  I'm the scout watching him.. come right into our hole and parks at zero.    Bait right?  I dunno.  Broke local, nice guy just bored and looking for a fight..  Sounds shady AF.  Warp to the far end of the static, yep... There it is.  Planet X, moon 4.  Half a dozen caracal navy, 3 sabres, 2 loki's, tengus.. DSCAN was pretty much full.     
---
Called him out and he's like "those aren't my guys".. I'm like dude, All the ships are tagged with the same symbol, you're all in the same corp, I'm literally on grid with them right now with a scout.    
---
He fesses up.  I end up joining their discord, jumping in a strat and running with them for a few hours.  Got a loki kill...
---
Wormhole people aren't nearly the bastards you think they are (although I was waiting to get blapped the whole time I was in their fleet).
---
You miss out on a lot of comedy ...
---
While your comment is not very nicely phrased, I'd like to +1 your sentiment: If you can just google the answer in 5 seconds, there's not much point in making a Reddit post about it.
---
I think you talk about the Damaged value of a ship that spawns like a leshak, there is only this value so you can just take this away from the HP from Shield HP as example.
---
For question 2, i added the damage a missile does but the bonuses and from where they come from is not inside the data i got from esi, so i am not sure if this is % or just a factor.
---
3) Copy Paste error on resists is fixed now.
---
4) not important...
---
I’m pretty new to the game- what t1 item is so profitable? I can only dream of billions of ISK
---
There's literally a sticky thread for stupid questions.
---
Oh, so you're in init then?  They're the only one's sensitive about rage...
---
fuuuuuu once I did not join because sleep (5am is bad time for eutz) and they got so juicy :-X  
---
You're not guilty until proven guilty.  
---
Let's not pretend to be innocent.  
---
Use your house key like a civilized person.
---
It doesn't go to the trashcan. The isk the botter corp paid as "rent" the alliance keeps. The ratting taxes or isk that went to the individual botting corp is all that gets neg-walleted. The proceeds still go to the alliance running the rental program. Further many alliances use this as a way to launder RMT and directly place bots in the rental program. They buy the isk and the  'renter' deposits the purchased amount into the executor corp as "rent"
---
Most stupid questions can't be easily answered by one Google search. This one can. It's not worthy of the Sticky.
---
You are exactly correct. The botting corp gets banned or neg-walleted but there is no penalty to the rental alliance.
---
Profitable, yes. But not very profitable. Go mining as an alpha, you will make thousands and thousands of isk.
---
He said he was going for cigarettes.
---
LOL
---
Well yeah, that’s why I’m asking more so about Industry, since it seems like a much better passive income to do on the side
---
&gt; also where is the store?, how do i upgrade my ship or buy new weapons or a new spaceship
---
There is a market icon on the Neocom (the bar of icons on the left).
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NeoCom#Business
---
Make sure to sort sell orders (top) from lowest on top, and buy orders (bottom) from highest on top.
---
Beware of where stuff is located when you buy it!  It will not be transported to your current location!
---
Note that orders with a duration over 90 days are NPC orders, and tend to be the best price.  All other orders are from other players.
---
There are major market hubs where players tend to gather.  From largest to smallest:
---
*  The Forge:  Jita IV - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant    
---
*  Domain:  Amarr VIII (Oris) - Emperor Family Academy    
---
* Heimatar:  Rens VI - Moon 8 - Brutor Tribe Treasury    
---
* Sinq Laison: Dodixie IX - Moon 20 - Federation Navy Assembly Plant    
---
* Metropolis:   Hek VIII - Moon 12 - Boundless Creation Factory

Jita prices are the benchmark for all of Eve.

---
dʒiːtə
---
I really appreciate your commitment to this valuable third-party tool.
---
They reposition some place else in system, the attackers reposition as well, no problem. No big deal.  In fact, it is more risk for the defenders to refit in combat, extract from the current grid, and reposition. At any rate, this comp was not made to disengage. It either kills or dies.
---
lol, nice straight up lies.
---
nO mY sEnSe oF huMoR iS bIg bRaIn
---
What a horrible answer.  
---
As an alpha, it’s designed not to make lots of isk. Can you do it, yes. But tbh, the isk you make either ways is minuscule.
---
&gt;If you have a renter area you have bots
---
We run a rental program my dude. When you kick people they get rid of sp and put it in other characters.
---
Known corps that were kicked from other rental empires wont get back in a renter area unless an oversight was made.
---
I dont blame any of renter recruiters in most blocs.  
---
HAY GUYS ISNT POOP FUNNY WHEN IT COMES OUT YOUR BUTT?! LOL ALSO FARTS HAHAHAHA
---
2-3 nano Avatars with a few Apostles is the meta these days.
---
HECON dropped militia.
---
 Wow this is a big achievement I remember when I got my first jump freighter I spent a lot of time mining in high security space in my Hulk (F#ck goons) and finally got one and joined red frog hauling to move peoples assets around the galaxy but people didnt tell me that i actually needed a character with a cnyosural field theory skillbook to use a cynosural field to jump my jump freighter to and when i finally got one and got a friend to light me a cynosural but he didnt know how to light a cynosural field and i ended up bouncing off the station like what happens when someone in code bumps you (F#ck code and goons) and i ended up dying 
---
So you know how you know i know you're dumb?  I didn't say that none joined, I said one of the bedrock beliefs of eve people are wrong, either theres no botters, or ccp doesn't do to wallets what we all think they do.
---
But you jumped on it like i said there were no botters because you're too fucking stupid to read the written word. 
---
Thanks for showing everybody you're a god damned retard.
---
god this is too much to handle. i have to addmit that i dident understand 90% of what you said. anyways i think ive been in the same system for hour and not able to get out of it. how do i get to the other system like  
---
* The Forge: Jita IV - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant or the one you said above .
---
ahow to exactly upgrade the ship. someone told me alt h and opens weird UI that shows my ship hp and armor but doesnt show the upgrade power 
---
Good video. I died right at the begining from a earlier fight 
---
Your comp is no joke and we were certain we would take losses but it was worth ago to learn.
---
We got a lesson and you got kills lol. Gf from stranger danger 
---
What about the droid attack on the wookies?
---
Yea i stayed hands off, i couldn't tell you who got charged what for what or why, I literally never wanted anything to do with that as my personality doesn't do well "giving the customer what he wants". 
---
I just know we were explicitly concerned about getting hit for it so we frequently filed a petition concerning the monthly money to get the company on the record as to the money being legit ours and legal.

---
Congratulations! The shuddering fear when you jump and warp them around await you. Enjoy your life of alts checking systems around you, checking killboards, and making ISK.
---
There's two sides to this right. Given that I've never botted, I don't rat or mine; I cannot, personally, tell the difference between a multi boxer and a bot. I do know botting is rampant in rental programs. Especially frats. However, when I was a rental manager I had no CCP provided tools to do any actual verification or real policing. I think the best solution would be for CCP to engage the rental managers and give some of the tools they use to catch bots as well as an incentive to do so. I think CCP should also measure the manager's participation in this program so they know where to look at the non-participants.
---
Congrats. You have bigger balls then me. Some dudes in game search out and kill freighters for the hell of it. Good Luck keep your d scan up and practice with ur alt on sisi first before trying any thing.

&gt; does choosing empire to explore matter at all. which one is the best to pick
---
There are only two soft 'limitations' in Eve:
---
* Standing    
---
* Security   
---
If your standing is -5 or lower with the faction that controls the hisec system, the NPC faction police for the system will attack you.
---
If your security is -5 or lower, you are an outlaw, and are kill-on-sight everywhere in hisec by players.  There are also travel restrictions to some high-security systems (I think 0.8 and higher).
---
You lose standing by destroying NPC ships and structures belonging to player factions (structures are worse), or by completing storyline missions offered by storyline agents.
---
You lose security by being 'naughty' in the eyes of CONCORD, which isn't possible to do when your safety is set to green.  Killing other players in hisec is one example.
---
&gt;10 years of having renters, never had a single negwallet applied to either PL or NCdot 
---
This is the part that is a lie, CCP dosent tell you why they neg wallet you, and you sure as shit arent an org that large without it happening.
---
&gt; Why does no one ever consider this?
---
because if you remove excavators, you remove the cost - so it's a self solving problem.
---
Where's the T1 love!?
---
*MWDs off with my Quafe Vexor*
---
Where are your pvp adventures?
---
Soooooo not responsible for other people cheating, just responsible for other people cheating if they are nearby. Got it. Ok. Still totally fucking retarded.
---
That's gone.
---
Ok then you're extra dumb, CCP never neg wallet hit PL over a decade of me being in leadership.  The wallet was visible to every Admin in the alliance, it had a dedicated monitoring page for all to see constantly, complete with a full log of any and all expenses from the wallet.  
---
So if the wallet never went negative at all, then its easy to assume they never gave us a negative wallet over a botter.
---
Son if you want out of the hole, put down the shovel.  If you want to spend the afternoon looking dumber and dumber I'm happy to oblige you, however you're just making yourself look worse with each post.
---
You mean you won't fly marauders in a kitchen sink fleet for shits and giggles?
---
So you say, without any rational reason why we should be punished for other people cheating. It's so stupid if I wasnt on the internet I would be shocked at how stupid this narrative is. Shame on you.
---
Dude... Not cool.
---
absent heroes was from really short sale for chinese new year, back in feburary

report the ad? to what end? it's not illegal, offensive, or otherwise against google's terms of use
---
Took the words right out of my mouth

To be fair I'm at 14 years and I don't know what's going on. I checked out after the last war in 2015 and went back into deep low sec. Apparently Command destroyers are a thing now :P
---
*cries in Gallente*
---
I mean i guess if you ignore half my post theres no rational reason given.  Its so stupid, that if i wasn't on the internet I would be shocked at how stupid you must be to ignore half a post because it doesn't suit your narrative.  Shame on you.
---
Tip:  mouse-over and right-click EVERYTHING.
---
Eve has a silly amount of drop-down context menus to do stuff.
---
You can also left-click and hold in space to get the radial menu.
---
Mostly a ton of feroxes hitting approach or keep at range on the FC, who is in that ship at the front. I’m not too good at recognizing Osprey variants, especially with skins, but I think that is an Osprey Navy Issue. The long thin ships around the sides are jackdaws, which probably got bumped away from the ball because they have less mass
---
We could make a better case for a slight buff in tracking to keep the logical separation from ACs.
---
We would still have blasters quite short ranged but not so gimp’d on tracking anything smaller than a super 🤣
---
you really needed that kevin guy from shark tank for the image.   This is a let down.
---
who drove -a- into the ground?
---
oh yea maka and that PEEEKAYYY queer
---
Depends, should be upcoming just had a few streams of FW pvp. Them's were some learning experiences.
---
Mine went out of some beer.
---
"Negwallet" doesn't mean "eliminates all of the money in the wallet and then takes some extra money away to make the wallet itself go into the negatives as a punitive" it means "generates a negative wallet transaction because of a GM, which isn't subject to the normal bounds checking for that sort of thing and could make it go negative, but doesn't if the amount of money the GM took is less than the wallet had." After forex, for example, I got negwalleted, but didn't end up with a negative wallet, because I had most of my forex wealth still in assets rather than liquid isk. As a large alliance with a lot of money (at the time,) I hardly believe that any GM negwalleting would have drawn the books dry. 
---
Apples and oranges. Don't compare them.
---
Fair enough. I'd like to see the Deimos get almost Vaga levels of speed.
---
Well, that gets into the other half of the reason not to -- CCP doesn't pay very well. :V They rely on the star factor of the position to compensate for a certain amount of remuneration. This works on a lot of people, but not people with my kind of work experience.
---
You need to mine everything manually. The athanor only serves to generate the ore field by pulling rocks, and to give bonuses to reactions.
---
Are you suggesting that GM neg wallet hits don't generate a log in the wallet right now?
---
Because they 100% do, and when you have a simple thing to aggregate out wallet transactions (which as a money many yourself you obviously do) are you also suggesting that a GM entry in your expenses wouldn't pull a flag, that you'd just not notice it happening?
---
Because it seems you're insinuating that we might have gotten one and didn't notice, I just need to make sure everybody is drinking the same coffee this morning and actually are entirely full of shit on this fine afternoon.
---
MMORPG = many men online role-playing girls.
---
True real-life females are uncommon in Eve, but no less valued.
---
Example:  Mynxee runs [Signal Cartel](https://www.eve-scout.com/signal-cartel/), the premier corp for solo explorers.
---
No you absolutely compare them, EvE is a competition and a game, and there isn't a competition or a game on earth where cheating by teammates on your team doesn't directly result in consequences for your entire team.
---
:nut:
---
Not gonna lie, I expected a 500 pound person.
---
Imagine giving up your home system without a fight and oh wait you don't have to lmao 
---
Any update? :)
---
Retribution is pretty great. Fit it like a slicer.
---
Got mine out for 4.15 give or take. 
---
Still, knowing I could've got it for 4.6...
---
What reason would you have to pay special attention to GM transfers here? At the scale of alliance-level finance, the transfers are too small and too infrequent to significantly queer the books. It's not like I have a report labeled "CCP THREAT INDEX" that specifically pulls negwallets. 
---
1. Report the ad to the site
---
2. Might actually wanna follow it and report it to CCP security and where you found it. They may track it down and contact the ad provider and have a better chance of getting through then you do. 
---
3. Use some sort of ad-blocker, some sort of a tracking blocker and something that disables RTC at least on your browser. Also Firefox with NoScript is the bomb.
---
4. Check your browser settings, disable 3rd party cookies, trackers and all that shit, also, might want to browse in incognito or private mode, this will help you avoid all sorts of nasty shit you may run into, not just Eve RMT stuff.
---
Can't look up now, but there was a duder last year that swtup some eve meets in Salem at some game cafe. Timing never worked for me though.  
---
I know a couple other nerds in and around Boston, so we exist ;)
---
It really all needs to be redone. There is a good reason for example why some ships are primarily used in fleet doctrines while others are not on the PvP end, just like there are good reasons why some ships are used so much in PvE while others fall behind, though in my mind from balance standpoint PvE is easier to deal with because you can simply adjust the NPCs instead of messing with player ships in many cases.
---
As far as sub caps themselves go, there are some obviously underused ships for too many situations, and they need to be brought closer to the line. Not saying they should all be homogenized as that kills diversity, just closer from where they are now.
---
 
---
... no? If Johnny Sportsman of the Cleveland Steamers gets caught juicing, Thomas Ballwrangler doesn't get punished. This is a dumb comparison.
---
There are lots of ways to do the same thing in Eve.  Find some you like.
---
At the top-left of the screen there should be a magnifying-glass search icon.  You can click that icon and enter 'Jita' into the search box.
---
You can also do the same search from the People and Places.
---
You can also type the name 'Jita' into the chat window at the bottom left, then press 'CTRL A' to highlight it, the right-click it and select 'system' (I think ... I do it without thinking).  Then right-click the newly created link, and set destination to it.
---
If you click on the column header of your overview for icons, it will sort it.  You can sort it so stargates appear on top.  If you have set a route, the next stargate on your route will appear at the top in yellow.  [Usually sorting overview by range is most useful, so be familiar with changing the sort order of anything that is displayed in columns and rows.]
---
Advice: in eve bigger != better. Cheap but angry T1 dessie like Catalyst can easily beat the crap out of a T1 battleship if the BS pilot is stupid enough.
---
Also: beware of scam. Always remember that your 'friends' will be the first to empty your hangar and loot your corpse
---
I'm not quite sure which word is the verb
---
Cleveland? Cleveland does not cheat. At least, according to his royal beardness.
---
If I told you, you and others would flood the market, and it would no longer be so profitable ;)

You are going to have to do some thinking, and market research on your own.

---
He’s part of a Corp that is literally known for war deccing highsec alliances, particularly ones that are home to newer players, and shooting them on undock. What the fuck are you on about?
---
no lets not waste our time on this petty crying.

---

---
Why does the title remind me of George Takei from Dragon Ball Z abridged?
---
Delve is goons, anime is cartoons 
---
Heavy Beam Zealot is underestimated but actually really good in small gang. Fits a lot of damage/range in a small package and has a decent tank+ADCU and is kind of fast (plus getting 10% more range in next patch with beam buff). The drone bay lets you keep some pocket sand ECM drones to throw at the inevitable ramjag/ceptor you run across to make a break for it (assuming you're anti-tackle doesn't kill them first).
---
Nomen is alright, but with ramjags being so common, its kind of lost its spot in being anti-tackle. Better to use an RLML ship or use a retribution for anti-tackle and have something else to shoot jags with.
---
Harbinger is getting a buff next patch (more PG), so what you could do before, you can do better now. 
---
Fleet Harbinger is pretty much the same
---
Sac isn't really a good option for small gang. You have some super niche fits like 100mn sac that can solo tank a carrier, but its not really worth it. Its 1 of several HACs that could use some attention. Its not bad, just doesn't really feel like it has a solid focus.
---
Maller is fine, again, not really small gang orientated, unless you're baiting. For solo, its still fun.
---
Absolution is the same. Lots of potential, but 3 mid BC is still a questionable choice. Fine for certain applications, small gang isn't one of them unless you're using it as a dedicated link ship to supplement a gang for capital killing. Though damnation is probably better for that.
---
Or the folks who live there live in multiple timezones.
---
A capsuleer while within capsule should be naked
---
But since this picture didn't arouse any primal part of my instinct, this isn't a capsule
---
Probably because you don't know the difference between a bot and a player.
---
Can’t walk around all day being a victim and offended. Just find ways to repeatedly haze him in game.
---
The internet was better two decades ago when Neanderthals like you couldn’t figure out how to access it. OP raises very valid points. 
---
get fucked and go cry in a non binary corner
---
How about we not pretend to be the entire student body of UC Berkley?
---
PvE does not equal botting. Aspirant? Maybe, but James has no power in Delve.
---
Times have changed and hypocrisy is not really acceptable anymore.  Plus if Eve is to become a more sustainable business concern, it needs to attract more than the rare hardened woman or visible minority from English speaking countries for example.          
---
I keep logs on a chat channel, the only way to do so is to be online, therefore after downtime each day (just before going to bed) I log that character in, and it stays logged in continuously. It is most definitely not a bot, but according to you, it should be reported as such. You are an idiot.
---
Each JF has one positive thing going for it - besides regional isotopes:

Nomad: Uses the least fuel to jump.

---
Ark: Looks really nice.

You could have been more polite about it.   I agree with the fact that this question didn’t require a post but the post didn’t require your toxic and asshole attitude either.

The BR for the fight in the video has a good old HK-style sabre feed at the bottom.  All told, we probably lost on the order of 50 of them.  (or at the very least 50 T2 destroyers; I was looking at it last night.)

Do you even know what bigotry means?
---

Tip:  You can right-click the Necom (bar with icons on the left), and lock or unlock it, then re-arrange the icons on it by dragging-and-dropping them, or even remove them by dragging them off the bar and dropping them.  You can also drag icons from the Necom menu and drop them onto the bar, for faster access to the stuff you use most.
---
Why not just exclude ventures from entering a plex ? Its supposed to be a mining / indy frigate, not for combat oriented stuff. Yes it will put a small dent by limiting some actual peoples creativeness, but it would be the far lesser of the evils.

Dont tell anyone who your JF toon(s) are!

The things on the edge of the blob are jackdaws in sharpshooter mode.  (You can tell by the long spindle with spines pointing out to the sides, almost like the sketch of a radio receiver.)  The blob itself is so jumbled I can't make sense of the polygons.

i do really wonder if people like you just go from one project to another to looking for things to get offended by.
---
Only one question for you, do you actually play EVE? 
---
Five years in game i'm yet to see a player who would post something like this and most people i encountered in those 5 years are really far from being dramma queens. 
---
There was one in NH a few years back
---
Check out a frigate called a Slasher. It kinda looks like an x-wing. It's very affordable so you could likely hop right into one. If you need help, send me a message in game (Legbeard Catfood) and I'll fit a pile of them for you to go play around in

Eve Online is more about people and relationships than spaceships.
---
"The best ship is friendship!"
---
The two most valuable things in Eve are friendship and trust.
---
 Bigotry:   
---
 "A bigot is a person who is intolerant of opinions, lifestyles, or  identities differing from his or her own, and bigotry is the  corresponding state of mind. Bigot is often used to describe a person who is obstinately devoted to prejudices even when  these views are challenged or proven to be false or not universally  applicable or acceptable."

Can't the Ark reach the highest tank out of all of them if fitted with Type-A adaptives and a full slave set?

---
These days, the more you give in to Political Correctness. The harder you try to make everyone happy. The more some people will get offended by something other people agreed with.
---
If you're the type of person who gets offended by words, you're gonna be really offended when someone ganks your shit. Maybe Eve isn't the game for you. The only "safe spaces" are docked inside a station. 
---

---
To be honest part of what makes eve great is that its a bastion against american hypersensitivity movements. 
---
The way to defeat racism is to shine a cleansing bright light on it and education. What you are doing is neither, its pushing it out of sight and out of mind where it can fester and gain strength.
---
Is nothing else going on in eve for this to still be relevant? Everything on both sides are already replaced 
---
We have lots of skins. Can we have AT back.
---
Don't call us Pandemic Horde. We are botting in Supers and Titans.
---
It still works but it's dumb and messes with my fun saying.
---
That said, an Anshar with Slaves and Bulkheads has more tank than an Ark with Slaves and A-Type Nano Platings. So technically the saying is "The Anshar has the most tank" but that's less informative.
---
https://i.imgur.com/AXv6HIi.gif

Considering the fight is only two days old, I'd say yes its still relevant. Though, it has been a rather slow couple weeks in New Eden.

If Johnny Sportsman of the Cleveland Steamers gets caught juicing and the management of the Steamers knew Johnny was cheating the team gets punished.  Thomas, as an innocent team member has to endure the punishment levied on his team for harboring a cheater.
---
Hey, you sound offended by just about anything. Thankfully, the internet being online- you can just, you know turn the computer off if what you're seeing on it makes you feel bad.
---
That's what I think you should do- turn off the computer, go pick up a nice picture book and don't come back.

Google does allow some leeway for website owners to restrict ads shown on their platform. I don’t know the specifics of the reporting process, but RMT ads could be disallowed given the right parameters.

Fair enough. Feels like a bit ago already somehow.

mate have you ever played another game?

literally any fps has worse than than i've ever seen in eve.

oh, I'm sorry man I thought this was serious, usually you don't write so much 
---
When you run a rental scheme in a game where people bot and you're potentially on the hook for their stupidity you sort the columns by the player name for red entries and search for "GM" literally every month.
---
You then petition the entire months income, every month, directly to CCP and as for an all clear before dumping it into the main wallet.
---
Not sure you guys are ready to run renters from the sounds of things querns.
---
This doesn't look lithe The Mittani at all :( ...

I would probably stop playing EVE if they decided to pander to every offended person.  This is kind of the reason I play, to get away from all the PC bull-crap out there.  There maybe someone's name in-game that offends me, but I would get more offended by the people crying about it.  
---
This, right there, *that* is what I had in mind when I said they needed to create non pay-to-win content that people would want to own.
---
If I can get that, I’ll fuckng spend money to own that skin and I’ll fly a Vexor-class ship again!
---
Goddamn that’s pretty.
---
Oh wow, you found Google lol.
---
But if you carefully read the definition, you will find that if neither party is willing to tolerate the opinions, lifestyles, or identities of the other person, they are BOTH bigots.
---
time flies when you are busy blowing space pixels up ;)

It never really hurts to invest in passive income if you have the capital. It may not make you super space-rich quickly, but done right doing multiple passive sources can really add to your wallet over time. 
---
&gt; Not typically meant as derogatory, as American "Indians" came to be admired during the latter period of common usage.

Even the top definition of your urban dictionary source claims it's not derogatory.

Or not logging in for besides rage pings

A surprisingly good reply, but in essence, that means the map is just a high-effort mode of shit posting.
---
Your race and such only affects:
---
* what you look like (and some clothing options - Amarr get hoodies)
---
* the starting NPC school corp
---
* the default NPC corp (where you automatically get put when you are not in a player corp)
---
* the default free Corvette ship you are given when you dock in a NPC station that you don't have any ships in the ship hangar
---
* some basic skills for piloting the Corvette
---
Beyond that, you can train to pilot any ship in Eve, travel anywhere, and choose to work (do missions) for any player faction ... or even work for a pirate faction!
---
Even if you have fallen to the bottom of the standing or security level hole, both of those are repairable.
---
i.e. If you make the Gallente hate you, you can always make them tolerate and even love you later.  It may take some effort, but it is do-able.
---
I personally work for Amarr and Caldari, so the Minmatar (opponents of Amarr) and Gallente (opponents of Caldari) are not thrilled with my choice, but I keep my standing good with both Minmatar and Gallente (by working for Sisters of Eve), so I can freely travel anywhere in hisec without complication.
---
why cant you wrap when you shoot ?? 
---
that actually has nothing to do with what PIRAT does.
---
they don't camp jita 4.4, in fact i am told that is explicitly prohibited in their internal rules, and they have wardecced any group that does camp the 4.4 undock to remove them.
---
they do not randomly wardec new player corps. they dec null groups, they dec groups flying freighters/JFs, they dec for contracts, and they dec groups that seem like they might put up a good fight.
---
Thanks.
---
I just like it when I have control over what happens with files etc, and not having to import all my chars into Pyfa. Being able to export it as a "stand alone" file and "storing" them in the EVE fitting folder,  which can then be imported by any client I want, when I want it, without having to fire up Pyfa again.
---
And that's how things work today in Eve. If an individual player is caught botting, he gets banned and his corporation gets negwalleted an amount equal to his tax revenue. 
---
To torture this metaphor even more, what you're suggesting is that the owners of the arena where the Cleveland Steamers do ballsports be punished for providing the arena in which players may be tempted to take ball shrinker juice in the first place.
---
how do i heal my armor, unlike shield it doesnt repair on its own
---
no, it isn't unfortunately
---
there are hypersensitive groups in Eve. they should be purged 
---
I hear your thread title in George Takei's voice. 
---
Biggest things you’ll need to do are find a good market to move into, set up transportation of materials, and set up a system for production. There are a lot of things in Eve to build so it’ll take quite a bit of initial research. One thing that can help a bit is joining a group that has a few markets/structures in its influence that you can sell to or use for more efficient manufacturing/research.

What do you think might make people stop posting like this? Should I shoot a carebear stare rainbow up their asses? I’m not your mommy. 
---
Literally none of the groups they dec care. They’ll never get fights because they hardly ever venture from highsec. Most of the groups that they dec live so far away that it’s not even worth the time for them to fly out and shoot at them. Meanwhile, P I R A T just sits in highsec and shoots the new players in these null alliances that don’t know any better. You’re also talking out of your ass about the 4.4 rule or they just don’t care, because I just opened zkillboard and can see multiple kills that happened on 4.4 that are still on the front page. 
---
Athanors do not collect anything (materials or isk) manually. You can set up the athanor to record who mines what and how much and use that information to bill people. Though, you need to collect that money yourself.

My dad used to say to me: Bulls get fed, bears get fed, ~~pigs~~krabs get slaughtered. 
---
No, that would be the case if there were only people in other alliances cheating in Goon space, however since there are actual Goonswarm members who bot (Or PL, or NCdot, or Darkness, or TEST) you equation doesn't add up because these cheaters are directly connected to the alliance in question.
---
You're trying to shake the responsibility of knowingly housing the cheaters and nothing you say will relieve you of that.  Every 0.0 alliance is guilty of the same thing, "i just work here its not my fault", but it is, because you have more power than the corp leadership of the botters corp.
---
"If you're botting, we'll boot your whole corp" goes a lot farther to motivate some spineless CEO's to better police their corp, the burden ultimately falls on the shoulders of the highest shot caller in the group.  
---
If you're a solo corp, then yes, your CEO is responsible, if you're part of an alliance, the buck stops at the top floor.
---
After being a member of the Discord, I now entirely understand.
---
As a "1st nation" person, I think I can say without any reservation (hah) that this thread is dumber than shit.
---
Did you forget that we ran renters for years? We somehow managed to handle things fine despite not having this sort of shit in place. What part of "the amounts involved are too small and the action too infrequent" did I fail to convey? It's not like CCP freezes all of your assets when they do a bot investigation. They limit the damage to the individual or corporation of bad actors in question. If you end up with a few trillion ISK in hock for a while because of a miscommunication or a GM misunderstanding a particular set of transactions, it's not going to be a big deal. It's just not enough ISK to warrant that kind of micromanagement.

&gt; so is it really hard to understand the game.
---
There are many 'games' in Eve, and many ways to play!
---
Your first challenge is to find stuff you like doing, then learn more about them.
---
It is possible to play Eve and never undock.  Some people do that (market trading, and industry).  Some people even play without logging-in (leaders and diplomats).
---
Recently, a player by the name of Katia Sae, completed [her 'game'](https://kotaku.com/eve-online-player-is-the-first-to-visit-every-star-syst-1833582152) by travelling to every system in Eve, 7805 of them.  It was a game she created for herself.
---
As intended! 
---
what you'll find if you actually look into it is that most wars on new bro corps are declared by very small isolated groups of griefers, not the larger merc alliances like pirat/marmite.
---
those guys have no interest in spending 50million to maybe shoot a frigate. they bash and defend structures. they take contracts. and between ops they hunt for valuable targets around trade hubs.
---
it's a totally incorrect perception that these groups go around deccing new player corps.
---
Thanks for the update. Good news about the Harbinger. Great looking ship. I'll take a look at this and see what I can come up with!
---

The only JF I've had an encounter with is one that was at war with us. It exploded. RIP that man's 3 bil.
---
&gt; Is it worth it?
---
Like the guy said below, the answers here are skewed toward yes. The game does have a fairly decent “Free” (Alpha) portion to it now, so you can just log in and try out some this stuff again for yourself and see if you want more. 
---
quiet and full of miners, don't know what is more sad       
---
Oh dear...
---
Using either of your numbers, lets assume it's gleaming spod. I see one unit of 16m3 of gleaming spod selling for 4000 isk in Jita right now. 
---
4000 isk per 16m3 spod = 250 isk per m3 
---
250 isk per m3 * 0.003375 m3 spod = 0.84 isk
---
250 isk per m3 * 0.0225 m3 spod = 5.625 isk
---
Blowing shit up is one of the core mechanics of Eve ;-)
---
Missions are handed out from the Agency feature, which you can find in the hamburger menu on the top left corner of your screen. For the second mission I mentioned Eve Uni put out a good walk through guide. It was written before the Agency was introduced, so you might need to start certain parts from the instead of what the guide says, but you'll figure it out.

For all you mentioning bombs, I was in this fleet and what you don't see is that 1.5km in front of this ball are couple of booshers just waiting for bombers to decloak.

Hey you're 100 % right
---
They're definitely being hypocrites.
---
I'm just of the opinion that you should be allowed to be offensive in the game.

Funny, I was cloaky camping some russian botters and despite them repeatedly saying downright horrible things to me for weeks, I say "Crimea River" once and a GM PM's me a warning.

Yes but the game itself does not bend to bow to them.

Quit answering “post like this”.  Ignore it.  Or what I’d suggest is to politely point them to the search box instead of the post button.  
---
you fninish the game by exploring??. also how does the market work, do you make ton of cash using it 
---
I feel like optimally playing your fit (a frigate one in 1v1 at least) isn't that hard to reach. What I meant is that it's way closer to a counter game where you probably already lost or won once you're both on grid and in tackle range, mostly decided by the distance between the two (can cheat a bit with speed). Thing is, there's not much you can do if you don't have the range control except killing it before it gets out of range of your tackle.
---
The skill is more around catching something you can kill, unsual fits helps baiting people but you know once they warp in on you they're dead
---
Although the "ball" that forms when stationary is horrendous, when properly anchored and moving, fleets form a line which almost barely resembles how fleets moves in real naval warfare pre-radio era
---
Fleets would travel single or double file in big snake-like rows, with messages from the fleet commander being relayed ship to ship by flag men
---
A message from the FC might take multiple MINUTES to make it to the entire fleet. So in other words, things were way more efficient in World War 1 than in a standard Goon mainfleet
---
My wife still doesn't believe me!

What's the isk/usd at these days? Ping u/bobmon

No hats allowed in the galley. It's meant to honor the wounded/dead. When the ships medical is full, they start putting people in the galley (where people eat) because it's the next cleanest place on the ship.
---
Spai! lol
---
You may note the "heavy" i'm not speaking especially about crowded ratting systems of big alliances nerds...
---
Wow.  Well I'm impressed on so many levels.
---
I just got lynched for trying to point out, very likely poorly, that though women may be a minority in Eve, their impact on Eve has not been.
---
Depends what your looking for, if small then jackdaws are really good but as you said not t1, moas are pretty good. Ferox are a strong fleet ship but would require decent numbers. Hurricanes are a bit over looked but can be very good. Medium neuts and AC or arty, can be both shield or armor tanked.
---
That was a good read, great article.
---
Look at that, I had no idea, thanks for the answer.
---
They can, they see stuff on the backend that we can't, as in the inputs being put in to the servers.
---
Which would give the same results as a system with a few bots running.
---
Since you clearly pointed to the thread in which the subject is being discussed, how about you continue the debate there?

---
There is no way to 'win' Eve (though an Eve meme disagrees), just as there is no single way to play it.
---
Eve is a sandbox, meaning you are given some basic tools (a pail and a shovel), then it is up to you to decide how to entertain yourself.
---
You may decide to build sandcastles, knock-over the sandcastles of others, steal the pails &amp; shovels of others, teach people how to use the pail and shovel, make angels in the sand, throw sand at people, manufacture pails and shovels, mine and sell sand, etc.
---
How you play the game can differ from everyone else.
---
Welcome to the sandbox!
---
jackdaws are rather safe, but not the best all round
---
Cormorants are fast, cheap, reliable, and pack a bunch with ok range.
---
Feroxes are your best go to mainline ship right now.   though depending on what wormhole your in, this can changes based on hole bonuses.
---
smaller groups might find hurricanes or caracals a bit more ideal.  and an Orthrus is always a nice scram ship to benefit a fleet. though it costs a bit.
---
In the old cannon and canvas days ships did not even have infirmaries.  The ships surgeon and his orderlies would treat the wounded on the mess galley tables because it was the only place they had available.  And yes because the galley was the cleanest place on the ship.
---
We would prefer Test Alliance to please ignore Snuffed Out's presence in esoteria.
---
awwwwwww
---
its about fitting into the group. not making the group change to fit you.
---
sadly so many outsiders, many female, don't realize this.  and those who do, usually have been involved since a young age.
---
heck most tomboys in the 90s are into tech nowadays. cause we grew up in that kind of group. =)
---
&gt; how does the market work, do you make ton of cash using it 
---
There are a few basics:
---
* harvest raw materials and sell them
---
or
---
* buy low and sell higher
---
You can add value to something:
---
* manufacturing
---
* transportation (hauling) [location, location, location]
---

Hello, Experienced logistics dude here. Just wanted to chime in (if someone hasn't already said it), the number one reason this trick works is that a pilot undocks, selects the gate in the overview and clicks jump. A wild nyx appears. Pilot panics and frantically clicks dock. This doesn't work as your shop is "in warp", even if you aren't aligned and up to speed. The safe (or as close to safe you as can get to in Eve) procedure is as follows,
---
1. Undock
---
2. Select the appropriate gate (hopefully hisec unless you're insane)
---
3. Click align
---
4. Hover your mouse over the Dock button until you are both, up to warp velocity, pointed straight at the gate. If uncomfortable for any reason, Dock it up
---
5. If you are fully aligned and good to go, warp and spam jump.
---
Happy hauling o7
---
I mean, I got probably a few hundred million ISK I could invest... I just dunno what to invest in
---
Still not sure if these skins are really cool or just ugly
---
It's not pretty hard, it's impossible. The entire idea is irrational and nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to go after large alliances from another angle. Look look! They're cheating because the cheaters are in their space! We cant beat them militarily because they're cheating! Dumb.
---
Don't join a corp unless you are ready to get ganked pretty much anywhere.
---
The joke here is that Stitch Kaneland is kil2 aka CCP Rise
---
I know you said not a T1, but use a T1 alpha/arty-damage Thrasher fit.  A bunch of those on field would fry anything in one shot if everyone is coordinated enough.  I love surprising the crap out of pilots with multiple thrashers.    
---
&gt;A surprisingly good reply
---
Not sure how to take that. ;)
---
&gt; just a high-effort mode of shit posting.
---
A little more than just shit-posting. If there are systems with the sort of consistent hour by hour activity, it might actually lead to some more botter deaths. Lots of systems have dedicated clacking crabs with high NPC counts but do the NPCs die at 4% of the total per hour, hour by hour? 
---
A lack of peaks and valleys in the chart would (to me) indicate it's being done automatically or some sorry soul is chaining himself to his computer every day and might need our intervention.

Do it for his sake, Malc. He needs you.

Grab a cheap pvp ship and choose a direction until you find good times.

If you dont like big fleets, there's always more small scale entities out there its specialized in small scale engagements, and more guerrilla warfare.

Get yourself in an alliance and start making juta rounds....80 to 100 mil flat rate or 600 isk per m3.

FUCK GOONS....we are the anti gank squadron....
---
Do you enjoy it?
---
If so, then carry-on.
---
If not, then try something else.
---
This is the answer, they are probably higs rigged or doing something to help them stay near the wreck so that they are alinged when they scoop it and can immediately warp to a tether
---
I suppose I do kinda enjoy industry- the problem is that I’m not really sure on how to make a decent profit
---
The venture is still better, you just need a hauler for jet-canning more often

So, I forgot about my sec status, and took my shiny brand new 2bil T3 cruiser to highsec to pick up a module.  I knew I made a mistake as soon as I was pointed by the police and fried.  I did LOL at myself, and learned a valuable lesson that day.  
---
Two days later I forgot about that incident and needed a module for my new T3 Cruiser I just bought.  I went to highsec again and lost that ship.  I'm pretty sure I was LOL'ed by everyone in my corp, and all their alt's corps, and all their buddies.   
---
Do level one missions until you figure out how to fit and use ships.
---
Explore the market and info everything.
---
If you only focus on profit, it will really decrease your play options, and reduce your game enjoyment.
---
Now, 'decent' is a relative term.
---
Example:  I can earn over 1b a month profit with 10 manufacturing slots producing T1 items.  I consider that decent.
---
It isn't just about ISK for me, it is also about time, effort, and enjoyment.  I don't really enjoy building T2 and T3, but I have when the reward was sufficient (what that amount is can vary with my mood).
---
I have a friend that spews-out T2 with tons of alts, and is immensely rich compared to me, but I just can't function at that scale.  It wouldn't be fun for me.

Also, they close the ticket because they aren't going to discuss investigations into another player with you. Its not a micro-aggression, its company policy.  Grow up.
---
Seems like there's quite a few of us nerds in NE. ;)
---
I was pondering joining up with you all too. Limited in time zone. I’ll try and find you for a roam.
---
That puts us at just under 10k unique players online right now using an avg of 3 alts per person
---
Yes I know that many people don't use/have alts but those that do pump the numbers a bit 
---
The average used was based on some napkin math using my coalition comms to gage how many alts our people tend to have online at once
---
I'm a bit of a newborn but I'm in the area, maybe down
---
Remember, if you get podded, you are back in k-space so you don't want some cheap throwaway ships like corms.
---
Important is also the class and the effect (if it has one).
---
Now that would work but give people even less opertunity to fuck up. You'd be suprised how many people fuck up anchoring and die due to it so if the FC only had to press a button and ppl would move that would make it even easier to not fuck up in a fleet which is why I am against such a solution. Sure it would save FCs a headache (and sometimes I'd love to have such a button and no the button that lets everyone orbit you sucks) but yeah not a good Idea in my books.
---
In FW, is running level 4 missions in a stealth bomber against Amarr (so for Minmatar), and blitzing the targets still a viable isk faucet?
---
And I say Minmatar because Amarr NPC e-war is tracking disruption, which a torpedo slinging stealth bomber just laughs off.
---
Goons need a new alliance logo.
---
Finally skins that don't look like copy paste jobs
---
The answer heavily depends on the number of pilots you have as well as what the effect of your WH is. It also depends on what you are responding to. A home defence fleet will usually be a different comp then the fleet you use to save a tackled orca or rattlesnake. Prophecies with auguror support can be effective in a brawling scenarios, vexos/VNIs can be effective as well. Caracles plus ospreys or scythes are a good faster doctrine if you want to go shield instead of armor.  If you don't mind getting away from T1 then gilas are an effective doctrine that don't require a lot of input from anyone flying one, and may of your WH pilots can probably fly one anyways for ratting purposes. If you only have 2-3 guys, then a neut geddon plus a couple of cruisers will ruin the day of a small hunting gang of T3s and strats. To make a long answer short though: it depends.
---
Good to know, always preferred Cal ships so probably stick with them for the most part atleast early on.

perhaps..... stop boating yourself......go peper yourself. i agree that this idea is good but would give not minute delay but 5minute un  unupgraded system.  upgrading system by one level decreases local delay by minut,at level 5  instant local.

---
my line of thinking was basically inverted - at 0 you have perfect intel, but as the pirates get detected more as you upgrade PDA levels, they feel pressured and start acting out and sabotaging your sensors, delaying local. this makes it a choice between ticks or safety

stay long enough, it doesn't stay that way.
---
I mean, yeah this too :D ON the odd chance you have hit "warp" instead of "align" though. Thus far i have only once had any issue which was when a cruiser decloaked and tried to bump me as I landed on the out gate. 
---
Now if only top side turret hardpoints remained closed, as in warp, on all vexor variant models except the guardian vexor (the only one with 6 turrets and the reason for this travesty) yeahhh that would be great. CCPLS.
---
i'm sure the art team would host a fantastic AT.
---
You do realize that corps without structures cannot be wardec'd.
---
Since krabs need to maintain infrastructure why not simply allow attackers, through isk and risk, the ability to potentially effect local by maintaining/deploying a siege structure with damage cap that must be removed to restore local. This is fleets, content, risk, potential isk sink and offers attackers an additional option.
---
Short deploy time with a build/isk cost that although appreciable, wouldn't be prohibitively expensive for groups to utilize. 
---
what are both talking about.
---
I love it but I feel like gallente gets all the love for skins while minmatar gets matte colors
---
Right now no but I'll take a look in about an hour and a half when I get home from work. 
---
please excuse me while i go back to making isk outside of null sec so it becomes a barren wasteland once again.
---
Ty thanks for the info 
---
To each their own, there are definitely pluses and minuses to both. While exploration is definitely cheaper to get into, my personal experience is that the isk return on exploration can vary wildly, and is ultimately much lower on average than the solid, steady stream of incursion isk. 
---
And beyond just the money, there are actually a lot of good core fleet fundamentals that you can learn in incursion fleets that translate well to pvp fleets later. Things like broadcasting, anchoring, fleet comes discipline. Basic stuff, but stuff you may totally miss out on if you’re new and stick to more solo stuff. 
---
As much as I like this idea. (Other than 1 minute being a bit too long) If this goes through, people can just park alts on gates. Yeah, it's more effort on their end, but with the same amount of safety. 
---
BR?
---
how do you build stuff. i heard you can build a gigantic space stations???. how do you buy low sell high? is it like stock market ?? 
---
and about transportation what is exactly it 
---
So you're arguing with a customer who points out a topic and demonstrates that with a simple string / keyword search there are names that cold be considered offensive / borderline.. and that's your best idea of the day... argue..

Falcon you've admitted yourself that CCP do not have automation in place for security (smile and wave to the botters out there for that tid bid btw)  and i'm guessing that is likely to apply this kind of policy enforcement. The report button has also consistently demonstrated NO feedback loop so to assert we're supposed to just blind / faith trust the option? .... i mean you do realise that the community by in large has zero trust with CCP in anything the say or do given the climate at the moment.
---
I'm still just shocked that a CCP employee just argues and shits all over a customer as the go to response for maturity.
---
No wonder this game isn't growing... 
---
what do you mean by making angels in sand??. ALSO I THINK I GOT YOUR POINT thanks

Okay, I see- got any t1 stuff that would be good to produce? Would Nanite Repair Paste be a good choice?

There are modules to repair shield, armor, and hull.
---
You want a shield booster (if your ship was designed to shield tank).
---
Look at the number of mid-slots and low-slots:
---
* mid &gt; low : shield tank
---
* low &gt; mid : armor tank
---
* mid = low : can be either, but usually shield tank because damage enhancing modules are low-slots, and it leaves more room for them
---
Beware that shield boosters use a lot of capacitor energy, and don't repair very much, but cycle very fast compared to the others, and repair at the start of the cycle (armor repair is more energy efficient, but slower, and repairs at the end).
---
You can also pay ISK to repair when docked.  See the icons on the right when docked.  All Upwell structures have repair facilities, but not all NPC stations do.
---
You can also repair by 'tethering' to any Upwell structure you can dock at.  Basically just warp to the structure and don't dock, and your will be tethered; after a few seconds you will start to be repaired.
---
Good to know you're not upset about it.
---
A change like this would not result in nullsec becoming abandoned, currently anyone competent can rat with near 100% safety. EVE is about risk, want the best ticks? There should be some risk in that. Highsec is less profitable because there is less risk, although some areas of null are probably more safe than hisec, CONCORD doesn't have 50 titans to defend you with.
---
Here you go, it really is what they say on the tin; a JB kill and that’s about it lol.

are you like 70 and don't know how the internet works or are you just retarded?
---
&gt; EVE is about risk, want the best ticks? There should be some risk in that.
---
yeh, and when it's good income, i'll do it. carrier ratting is barely better than high sec incursions last time i checked. and you want to increase the risk for something that isn't even that good to begin with?
---
yeah, like i said - excuse me while i go and get more income for less risk and hassle and effort elsewhere.
---
"All damage on Mr Rive"
---
I wonder where Marines gravitate to in the Eve sandbox?
---
Are highsec incursions still a thing? Ran with TVP a while ago and their HQ fleets seem to be dead...

---
I like the idea, it gives krabs the option of safety/vs ticks. Although I think 1 min per level is far too long. A competent hunter can get on top of you in less than 40 seconds. Reducing it to 5 seconds per level would probably still give sufficient risk, giving hunters 25 seconds in level 5 systems. 
---
Paste is a PI product if I remember correctly. I dont think alphas can do PI. 
---
What do you mean when you say "got mine out"? Someone took your sell order?
---
sounds like some one is upset that they've got nothing to smug about.
---
I can buy PI stuff tho
---
good to know you still try to pretend INIT can do anything on their own
---
Sold it all, yeah.

There's no doubt it's a small but rabid fanbase keeping CCP's lights on. That's why every newbro matters.
---
Dunno dude, I fragged 120 of your guys like an hour and a half before this with a quarter of your numbers. 
---
I think EVE in TYOOL 2019 has set a certain threshhold for the smugposting; if you've killed less than 30ish Billion you should probably just keep it to yourself for your spankbank.
---
mine? i don't have any dudes.

True. Ive been back in the game for 2 weeks now so Im a little rusty.

I came back this week lol
---
EVE is very hard to get into and most people dislike it, so player retention is minimal. The players know that the game can't survive without new people, so they do their best to help them out as much as possible in the start.

EVE Pro Tip: you **will** lose your ship at some point. It is going to happen. It happens to everybody. You *do not* get your ship back. Everything in it, on it and maybe your pod goes *poof*. And that’s it. You can cry about that, like some people do, or you can chalk it up to experience and get a new ship. If you can do that without melting down [which the guy[s] who blew up your pod is/are going to love more than anything (so don’t do it), you’re going to be just fine. It’s not pleasant, it’s not the end of the universe. You will find, over time, that you’re one of us. Whether you like that idea or not, by that time won’t matter ;-)

WTM is going strong, I just joined a wh Corp and did a few incursions with them to get some isk, and it’s over 100 mil/hr not counting lp,

To be fair, I’ve been doing incursion logi with my volume turned down to 0 and I can still manage fine. For dps it’s a bit more complicated and you probably need to listen to commands, but for logi it’s extremely straightforward

Read and start out with the different T1 frigate fits. A 5-10m frigate will teach you just as much as a 50m, so go cheap in the beginning until you have the basics down.

Just be aware that you'll often be fighting older players with perfect skills, expensive implants and drugs often, even in T1 frigs.

1. Frat has never kicked a corp from frat rental for botting even when I report flat out that x corp is a botting corp. In fact, Noraus doesn't even kick corps he knows were banned for botting.
---
2. I have no clue what KWG corp you're referring to as I have never accepted a corp from KWG into my alliance and dothan bears that out. You're trying to obfuscate the issue here with your bs. The issue I and others have mentioned isn't knowing in advance whether a corp being brought into the rental alliance. The issue being discussed is keeping ones that are known bots in the rental alliance.
---
3. It goes a step further with fraternity. Noraus specifically places botter corps in the rental alliance to launder the generated Isk and protect frat proper from CCP penalties

For cheap and basic T1s Thrashers, Cormorants, for support Ferox or "gasp" Drake. If you're looking also for an effective sideline role, a T1 Celestis can be fitted with double or even triple dampeners and can damp targets while sitting at 120-150km out depending on how its fit and can be used to great effect, but this is more of a tactical support role and does take some practice to use effectively.

In defence of my fellow pilot I want to point out that EVE nerds are in a class of their own. Ben Croshaw ‘Yahtzee” said that EVE nerds are to nerds what nerds are to normal people. It adds a bit of an extra hurdle to find ones place.
---
We have female pilots. I have met quite a number at Fanfest. They are all my kind of people: hardcore geeks and nerds and I love every one of them. In EVE women are rare. Because it’s not really that accessible an environment, even to gamers who like to believe they’re good at other games.
---
EVE is not like other games. It really is not.
---
I always love to see women join our ranks because female gamers, in my experience, make the place so much better. We need the female perspective, it is invaluable to the experience.
---
/u/TauCabalander is right that females in EVE are uncommon, but that’s not to say they are not welcome. They very much are. Please don’t shoot him down, he does list some good examples.
---

---
But women are a [vibrant part](https://imgur.com/qbCEqjB) of the community and it’s a blessing to have them. Also [they are awesome](https://imgur.com/nB9JhPK) in [more ways than one](https://imgur.com/aaOIXbZ) and some of them like [Sindel Pellion](https://imgur.com/LQSn2eh) have a fantastic talent at singing.
---
I love women in EVE. There can’t be enough of them. You should engage us, ask questions and not take any of our bullshit because, when you are treated like any other pilot as you should be, there’s going to be a great deal of that :-). It’s all part of the fun.
---
Be welcome. Don’t shoot us down, we’re happy to count you among us.

The fact that TNT is in the Imperium and Iron Armada is coalition free alone makes this statement ridicolous. TNT is a comparably weak coalition member (compared to other members of its coaltiion) whileas Iron Armada are only "on friendly terms" with Goons and otherwise do their own thing and are their own lords.
---
Unspoken is in a coalition, although they created it themselves, are the leading force and don't have as much and as powerful diplomatic relationships as TNT have.
---
Short: TNT can always rely on Goons BY DEFAULT. Iron Armada and Unspoken can't rely on anybody BY DEFAULT. They might ask others for help and others might come, but none of them has a big daddy that wants to save them automatically.
---
Just to make clear: this is not about strength, sympathy or anything, this is about (layers of) independence and neutrality.

I didn't have anything specific in mind when I wrote that.  Just another random activity that's possible in a sandbox.
---
Basically a solo non-conflict activity, where you leave your mark on the environment behind.
---
Like leading a corp, or being the first one to visit every system in Eve, or maintaining an Eve graveyard (yes, that does exist), or sky-writing, or ... 
---
- gather resources + a blue print. Combine the resources and the blue print, hey presto, in a few minutes / days / weeks / it creates an end product. Bigger things take longer [as in: actual earth days]
---
- You can build gigantic space stations. If you want to do that: go right ahead, somebody will be able to use your talents and skills.
---
- You buy something for a low price and sell it at a higher price. Or you blow up their ship and sell the stuff that falls out of the hold [what we call: the loot fairy]. Any price you get for that is selling high because you didn’t pay for it :-).
---
- It is not like a stock market because you’re not buying shares, it’s like a commodities market, you buy/sell actual products.
---
- Transportation is what it sounds like: a product [widget] needs to be brought from A to B, both being star systems. Depending on what it is, you need: a scout that flies fast with high-value / low mass goods like blue prints. Industrials for modules/weapons, a ship carrier to ferry fitted ships [there’s a way to ship them compacted but then they can’t be fitted], or use freighters for when you need to haul large amounts of ore/minerals.
---
Thanks. Good to see The Initiative taking the initiative.

Hadn't expected them back after the Hakonen deployment debacle.

My entire Air Force flight did the same, that’s how I got hooked.

My dear, this rabbit hole is deep and it branches off in wild and unexpected directions ;-).

Don’t try to understand all of it in one go. It is an actual universe where there are tens of different things to do. In each one the details and nuances matter. It matters what you do where, who you do it with and how.

You've actually built new titans to replace these ones, and bought or made new dreads? I though Titan builds took a bit longer than that?
---
Or by "already replaced" you just mean "our alliance has a lot of krabs?"
---
I guess when you spend all of your working life in a super regimented organisation you probably don't want that in your leisure time too.
---
A way to resolve conflict is to declare war. You used to be able to declare war on everybody. This is extremely problematic if your outfit is just 5 guys who just want to dick around in space and the assailant is 50 guys who know what they are doing with nothing better to do.
---
So, they changed that. If you’re a corporation without space assets [you can have your own station] then you can’t be ‘war decced’ in our parlance, because you don’t have the assets to sustain a war and they don’t want to frighten away people who can’t defend themselves because they don’t have resources to defend their territory.
---
NER is Panfam affiliated. Don’t hold you’re breath.

I dont get why people feel the need to run to reddit for shit like this. Leave this to the people running fleets and actually representing the alliance. When it comes to celebrating peanuts im more than happy to leave that to panfam.

How about you cut your nails first. Probably have all kinds of doodoo under that long ass pinky nail.

This is an underrated/underupvoted comment!

Thank you for explaining why it should be upvoted, we may have missed it otherwise.

You sound like you had some bad luck then. There's no shortage of fights and active corps
---
Damn, you’re right. Maybe this is why my teachers always said my problem solving was too two dimensional.
---
This is actually a pretty good idea, though I think 1 minute per level is too much. 15 seconds maybe. Plus you shouldn't appear in local at all (in any system, even HS) until you break gate cloak.
---
I wonder why bottom-feeding welfare pieces of shit feel the need to continue to live vicariously through video games instead of accomplishing a single thing with their lives so their parents do have to make excuses for them at every family event in public, but here you are *clap*

We had an FC back in like 2007-8(ish) who made himself famous in my then-corp (not even sure in what alliance, but he was not in the corp), by trying to play EvE like that...
---
Not only he sounded like a badly played sergeant out of a B-rated movie, his brilliant tactics included things akin but not limited to:
---
"Listen, men! We will form a wedge, with me leading the thrust, and we will drive that wedge into the enemy fleet, cutting them in half and driving them further apart as we proceed. Follow me!"
---
He was absolutely brilliant. Hadn't won a single fight, ever. What a legend. 
---
For years later, when one of us would see his character logging in or out of the game (in contacts) we would stop whatever we were doing and say his name on comms, adding "is on / off"...

I was trying to make the point, probably very poorly, that though women may be the minority in Eve, their impact on Eve hasn't been small.  So I named a few that came to mind (Lady Scarlet is another one, though she has many detractors, they tend not to have achieved a similar position of importance in Eve).
---
I had a logistics fleet mentor that was a woman.  We all breathed a collective sigh of relief whenever she joined a fleet.  I remember well the day when she wasn't feeling well, and named me to lead the fleet's logistics wing.  That was an honour.

I wanted to encourage women in Eve, not disparage.

I apologize for doing a bad job at it.

She chose to play and finish the game her way. Which was to travel the entire Eve universe. The game is huge beyond belief you are trying to grasp to much at 1 time. Its a great game I started in 2006.

Take for example [their CEO claiming that CCP should force wormholers to use porpoises for rolling](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aipf5u/was_there_anything_implemented_to_replace_hic/eepmbry/?context=0). Anyone with this attitude doesn't deserve a place in wormhole space.

Unfortunately on Tuesday someone pointed out that the system was in fact a Pulsar, rendering our Archon eviction doctrine completely useless. We began moving our carriers out of system last night. By 2026 we should be fully extracted and ready to hit our next target.

So this is where people play EVE these days.

Hey that's mean :(

Or just bring a fleet in through it. You can get a lot of T3Cs and a command ship or two and all the bubblers/command dessies etc you want through a crit hole.
---
Wtf can't you just turn off the pulsar for a bit?

Have you checked your hangars recently?

Hope you have alot of 3200 boosters for me.

&gt; Ark: Looks really nice.

I don't know ... to me the Providence &amp; Ark look like capsized ships that my OCD wants to right.

This is a small change that would help a lot. Another would be to give suspect timers to neutrals that slide into plexes (or a similar change).  Players shouldn't take security standing hits from participating in FW.
