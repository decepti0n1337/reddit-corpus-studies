Do you really think bot cannot click buttons ?
---
Maybe I missed something, but what makes this different from then usual presentations they have at events?
---
Good job dude.
---
Look at frig abyssal sites. Designed for 3 players to enter, after a week people figured out to multi box hawks in them.
---
Poor short dino arms
---
Sssssh, don’t tell everybody, we are this close to infiltrating TEST to a level only before seen by the Judge or Haargoth. If you’d only keep quiet for a few more weeks the plan would create a power surge not seen before in EVE!
---
Dunk in CSM? Yikes, nice dude but the last thing CSM needs is more nullblobber representation.
---
Made me chuckle
---
He is right... "And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!"
---
Didn't you get kicked from PH?
---
&gt;They obviously are incapable of handling bots.
---

---
They are not incapable, simply unwilling, if one person can ban hundreds in a 3 month period an actual team designated to eliminating bots and supporting peligro could be expected to make reasonable progress on the issue. The problem is CCP just doesn't give a fuck, because that would cost them money not make them money And trying to point out to CCP that removing illicit RMT and botters would drive people to buy more plex legitimately seems to be a waste of time.
---
can confirm haha
---
Yeah VNI hunting is honestly part of the problem. 
---
Too many people endorse it by making it a pasttime which is just an excuse for CCP to leave botters in the game.
---
PvP people not bots. Bot hunting is just pve.
---
You should probably join the bombers bar discord and ask there: [https://discordapp.com/invite/54gHzMR](https://discordapp.com/invite/54gHzMR)
---
Another good idea would be to join the Bombers Bar ingame chat channel, fittings are listed there too.
---
Thank you!
---
Is infected mushroom! I had to use 2 songs! I just had to!

Even cruisers?

The the difference between a low SP pilot and a high SP one is mostly level 5
---
Uncanny valley.
---
it is not! iam playing with main and my two other alt ratting in VNI, so reds can still go and get KM from my VNI alts, after all these nerf why should I even log in my alt?
---
Yeah all that I've found is needed for just solo spaming t3s till my alts have the skills needed to start running t5s solo
---
Fits please?
---
i will fly it if it is needed,  There are many different forms of Ewar out there than just using a target painter.  
---
Personally my favorites are jams or a web ship.  There are also various fits for counter support such as neutboats.  
---
Yeah i perfer ewar, its each to approach your FC and F1 but there a bigger sense of usefulness when you have more utility to bring to the table.

The issue is CCP still haven't solved the bumping issues with caps jumping through cynos, so you aren't going to see a collision effect until they sort that out and its been an issue since caps were introduced.
---
I thought I'd fucked something up while messing with ESI in excel
---
only if you were POS bowling to knock ships outside the shields.
---
Join the ingame channel "Bombers Bar". The MOTD (all the text at the top) will have a link to fittings. If you get a little lost, don't be afraid to ask in the channel for help
---
Yes I second this. Please don't fly around all by yourself. If you're reading this and are new... Convo the other miners in belts with you, ask a corp PvP gang in system if you can fleet with them or join in somehow.
---
BIG one: After a good fight (where you felt like you did at least one thing right and didn't die in 10 seconds or less) message your opponent(s) about it. Most of the time you won't regret it. Some of the time you won't get an answer. Very slim chance you will be berated or put down or enticed into a scam.
---
That guys pants. Good lord
---
Back when I was in Yulai Federation I ended up getting friendly with another guy. He wanted to leave the null games behind and go into WH space, and we half-heartedly planned out a wormhole corp. I ended up leaving NLDF and eventually EVE and we kinda parted ways.       
---
Fast-forward to like three months ago and I'm roaming with The Mighty Beans. We get dropped and fucked up (because TMB are trash) and I send a friendly EVE-Mail to the guy who had blown up my Merlin. Apparently he posted it somewhere and my old friend messaged me in-game and we got back in contact. He ended up convincing me to join MCAV, which is nice.       
---
Still the only friend I have in EVE, because I suck at making friends.

Umm, there is a Cruise to Alaska on the 30th and an EvE Meet on the 29th in Seattle at the Crab Pot.

---
Can confirm, we're holding Sapporo hostage... he doesn't know it yet.
---
So this one was cool, we were playing around an Orthrus, warping back and forward between objects on grid, until I landed close enough to tackle. My 15 mil Thrasher did die, but not before secondary tackle landed and fleet blapped his 900m ship. https://zkillboard.com/kill/54980337/ I got about 200m of the loot.  
---
Well this one is pretty self explanatory https://zkillboard.com/kill/74270586/ but this time I got nearly all of the loot.  
---
Can't be bothered to find more killmails, but yes indeed holding someone until it's dead is super exciting, plus tacklers often get monetary rewards since you're closest to the wrecks.
---
Thank you! I will look as soon as Im in game
---
There is scouting and CovertOps... Flying ahead of the fleet and seeing what's coming at them.  Ask you corp if they need "eyes".  You don't have to shoot to  support the fleet.  I have my main that I fly with the fleet but the FCs were always glad I brought my CovertOps Alts.  And sneaking though a bubbled gate camp while dictors are buzzing by trying to uncloak you can get  your adrenaline going.
---
Your leaks are bad : The bastion is living in fountain in sone system, not their renters everywhere.
---
your mind would explode
---
That also could be plausible used ship.
---
a narrative we like to keep
---
Or u can fit polarized hecate get more dmg less isk. K bye.
---
Running Havens = Ishtar
---
Running Hubs = Domi
---
Barring abyssal mods on the Domi ofc
---
At 55b, what's the time to break even?
---
Go logi. Theres only 4 ships you need to train (8 if you want to add the logi frigates as well). Everyone loves you for keeping their shiny ships alive and you do not need to skill a new doctrine every other month. The only downside is that you do not end up on killmails.
---
What’s with the weird bpc icon?
---
Exooki is pretty much a null guy he runs in that crowd
---
Adapted to the current meta what it all about. Grayscale space aids is a-testament to that.
---
Take salvage bookmarks for example. The wrecks expire after 2 hours, so putting them in a folder with 2 hour or 3 hours expiration would be great.
---
Im more leaning towards he is going to be CONSTANTLY whining at arguing during CSM meetings to the point that nothing gets discussed at all because the CSM meetings consist of Olmeca Gold Screeching and Whining because of his unhealthy obsession with hating anyone in nullsec and CCP will just remove him for bad conduct so that actual discussion can occur in the CSM.
---
But hey, thats just a theory.
---
351. Idk if I can match the lint so have a whole extra isk
---
Well and countless other alliances
---
This is the most amazing change ever.
---
you just fit mjd and some neuts on hi slots and domi never get effectively tackled by inties.   
---
RIP for null hunters, they just get a much less targets
---
1 million isk.
---
The VNI is now no better at rating the the Vexor
---
Being able to change either long/short range at top would be nice
---
Wouldn't that also nerf drone ships against ecm?
---
He has skill in an extremely narrow, specific, niche form of gameplay.
---
it's a Guristas Komodo Blueprint Armored Cache
---
Yea there's more work, but you can't build ships with ISK only.
---
But now you have to load up all your alts bots with ammo.
---
Agree.
---
Just meaning to add the "what else does this effect" factor.
---
Have a great weekend!
---
Like three years ago, yeah.
---
Orcas are coffins in nullsec
---
People figured Hawks out before they were even released
---
The Navy caracal being bad is just a meme at this point. I can't remember a single time when I thought or heard "a navy caracal would be good here" in my 4 years of playing eve.
---
I'm more fearful of what they're going to do because of this data.
---
Had the same issues, 6 days, enjoy netflix...
---
What is CCP changing about tether? Are you completely immune to bumping or something?
---
Also, wasn’t it the original intention that bumping a ship off tether would be impossible, but then they never got around to implementing that?
---
You misspelled Magnate for content lol.

Ichi made space ghosts great again.

[CSM Voting Audit Log](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/resources/auditLog14.txt)

How does this work? I understand the basics: Election winners over a threshold have the excess votes transferred downticket and the candidate with the least points is eliminated each round. I'm moreso wondering about the specifics: Can someone explain the math behind it?
---
Long time listener, first time caller.  Why is it that the Kronos ritual is full of media savvy members?  There is Blood and Jokastis all over YouTube, and Fayral with his outstanding streaming.  Does this perhaps help with piloting, or have an added benefit beyond fame?  I will hang up to listen to your answer.
---
Fair enough.
---
Sad that you've become so salty. Hope the game picks up for you.
---
Afrais
---
jesus what happened to you man
---
On the only hand, you're right.
---
On the other hand, drone auto aggro is the only reason I beat 8 people solo in the greatest EVE Online gank video ever made.

So I'm torn.
---
Yeah, that would be especially nice.

I had played for quite a few years without making a single lasting friend. Bored with life in Provi I, on a whim, applied with KarmaFleet. 
---
Due to my job, I was not able to go on a lot of fleets, but saw what the corp did for new players and was happy with how things were going.  I was always looking for a way to help out the new players, as that, along with shitposting on Reddit, are what really makes me happy with Eve.  I saw an ad on the forums to join the KF recruitment team, and happily applied, not even sure if I would be accepted. I wanted to join because I had been having connection issues and would lose synch with server during fleets. But the recruitment job if I lost connection there was no issue.
---
I GOT IN! I was happy and started processing apps.
---
It was there that I met Toni Delancor, and later many others. But Toni, well, Toni had a different way of doing things, and we clicked. He was promoted through the ranks (he was an officer when I joined) and eventually ended up becoming a full director in KF (along with another Alliance level Spacejob).
---
When I first got my tickets to Vegas last year I was super nervous about going. I hung out with leadership in Slack, but that was just a chat room.  Now I was going to actually meet these guys.  Toni went out of his way to make sure that I had a great time at Vegas, making sure I got introduced to all the folks I had been talking to in Slack, and meeting a bunch of other people along the way.
---
Toni has a bad reputation among many for being an asshole. It isn't that he is an asshole, he just sees the rules and applies them, and doesn't like to be lied to. And he isn't scared to call be out for stupidity. Just like me. That is why Toni is my friend.

MUH KB
---
Met someone in a renter corp of GSF many months ago.
---
Teamed up ratting because it was too crowded one evening.
---
We went different ways since then but still talk eve a lot on discord. My only eve buddy.
---
Grinding and getting rich in isk is satisfying at the start. But when you have all your toys its the pvp that keeps you around. 
---
Besides, if you learn how wars and pvp are fought you can make big isk by supplying doctrine ships. Preferably those ships that blow up often.
---
Only on the first shot. After that, not until they finish firing, since they reload and require manually reactivating. It's kind of silly.
---
AFK ratting is ok though. AFK ships are free kills floating in space and still take some actual work to run in bulk. It's botting that's a problem, and drone aggro has nothing to do with botting.
---
So it has the bpc and?
---
The vni changes will result in more variety of ratting ships, im totally fine with that.
---
Has it ever been different? EVE has always been a game with seriously low retention of new players, not sure if that shows anything alarming to be honest.
---
More importantly, how do those numbers look for eve over time?
---
Not really, with some speed rig/nav a gila can get the mediums to stay on top of an ass frig and it's lights out from there
---
Can anyone translate this into english?
---
Daily quests.
---
literally just automatically decycle the gun and queue up the ammo change when you change ammo mid cycle
---
Blops BS I mean
---
Every T3 has a special storage receptacle for lube. Didn't ya know?
---
&gt; ECM was essentially removed from the game
---
As a giant fan of ECM this really pisses me off. I think it would be fine to rework the ECM system where it breaks a percentage of your locked targets and reduces your max number of locked targets rather than turning off your ability to lock. 
---
This would make ECM less overbearing in one-on-one or small gang situations but still preserve the lock-breaking mechanic. As it stands, the "taunt" mechanic is really just not very fun or useful for the ECM pilot unless they have a deathwish.
---
Welcome to EVE.
---
Unless you want to pay through the nose, you must now spend days, weeks or months of real-world time training skills to unlock different parts of the game.
---
I'm really not surprised. They refuse to slay the sacred cow which is arenas and quick gratification.
---
Give every new player access to an unlimited supply of fitted ships that are constrained to within a given system or pocket of deadspace, and let them fly, die, shoot at other people, and all the fun stuff, complete with the necessary base skills already injected and trained in their head.
---
I'd rather see new players die over and over in combat with actual other players than sit warping from station to station for a week.
---
The problem with EVE is, without direct player-on-player interaction, it's just so damn repetitive. I' not surprised the dropout rate is so high.
---
whatever goons tell him...
---
...Hilmar says he wants to make null sec dangerous and less stagnant, but you spent the last six months perfecting mooring and getting sigs to be visible from anywhere in the agency...
---
My coolest story, well, I have a few, but here is one. Firstly, someone reports a barghest, a faction battleship, in our home system. So, I warp over to the gate where it’s reported and see a slasher burning over to it as fast as it can. Then the slasher gets close, and scrams the barghest. I’m about 70km off so I start burning in with my mwd heated, and I manage to get tackle right as the slasher goes down. Turns out that was a abyssal/faction fit barghest worth maybe 5-10 bil. Dead because someone 30 days into Eve, flying a 1 mil ship, got scram on him.
---
Great stuff in the keynote, really looking forward to all the stuff. Nice qol features, more variety in null ratting ships will also be nice, and... Nice pants bro
---
Lol, I thought my ballot would be unique,

but someone other actually voted just like me :)

Lmao TAPI trying to save face "LOOTSCRIPTZ"

People who post long sarcastic messages written half in CAPS do sound a bit salty, yes.

But if you're actually feeling great and just have a spergy posting style, then great news.

Less tedious = better

Its not reducing the challenge at all, its merely communicating information better to the user. Its a great thing allround.
---
hard to feel for the guy after he took it like a girl.... he did not fight back at all and really allowed himself to be a joke. Hope he reads this and finds some balls
---
Every single big battle against the goons I've been in they have outnumbered us, what are you on about lmao
---
lmao at this post is this guy serious?
---
I don't have any friends in EVE.
---
wat do?
---
As much as I am able to process the fact that ppl in game are not in any way an actual boss or superior or anything like that... I still get a bit nervous about hopping on discord or on the phone to chat with anyone who is at my "level" or above in command/responsibilities.
---
I dunno why. I do public speaking all the time. I'm a handsome-enough 6'1" tall white dude with dark features and muscles. People listen to me and respect me and I'm used to it.
---
But it remains, I still get a bit of a weird. Feeling like I'm calling a client or a superior for work, less like a video game.
---
Just remember, it's all a game. We're all doing it to have some fun and stimulation. It's not real.
---
It's not real...? Haha
---
Current VNI with my skills has 467 dps with my skills, new VNI will have 540 dps with void and hella good tracking and a big tank bonus. Gonna be nice abusing it before they realize.
---
i think it just opens into the blueprint
---
i would assume so an interceptor can't just fly by and steal it (they're 20km3)
---
I find I have few for all the years playing as well.
---
But then again, I went to a high school with over 2,000 people and I barely made any friends there too.
---
Friends are special. Hang onto them if they're good and true ones.
---
Well there's currently two types of triglavian content, both fit in the PvE category. 
---
The first one we call abyssal sites - they are essentially instanced dungeons you can run with either a single T1 or T2 cruisers, or up to three frigates. The income is very good, comparable to capital ratting, and you can do them anywhere you like, including hisec. However, running the higher level sites can take extremely expensive setups and they're by no means easy. They are purely PvE in that no other players can enter the dungeon with you. However, your dungeon entrance is visible in normal space, and players could decide to camp it and wait for you to come out. 
---
The other type is called Triglavian invasions, and they are very similar to incursions - it is group-based content that occurs almost exclusively in HS. I can't speak too much regarding profitability.
---
He is a twat though, whatever Merkelchen said.
---
Yeah I ran it and with max skills, 3x Heavy Neutron Blaster II w/Void M, 5x Tech 2 Gallente drones (2H/2M/1L), and 3x DDA II gets you 765dps.
---
That's certainly a possibility. When you read the patch notes from previous CSM's is sounds like they discuss a topic, everyone gives there two cents and they move on to the next item CCP has on their list. I'm wondering how well olmeca wanting to read a 5 page thesis on every single topic is going to go over.
---
We would need to see the rate of old users leaving. I have my suspicions it's a scary-high rate.
---
Its not NDA that Sion though i directed the reddit hive mind to get angry at sion after the whole r/eve is not a community and you better not miss if you come after the community posting. This was way back.
---
For the juicy stuff wait a while
---
And other nice places like the Gallente Pleasure Hub.
---
Thank you Olmeca!
---
Be a great CSM, and advocate for the good of eve, always!

---
Didn't know Tom Brady played Eve.
---
I was in the support frigate fleet.
---
Shit was fun as fuck. Also my first ever red pen too!
---
Just like the widow and nighthawk
---
I don't think this Google thing will catch on.  Metacrawler is better.
---
It could be kept how it is, but drones could take a way longer response time to attack, maybe 20 seconds.
---
The click fest that eve already is, is very annoying.
---
Keep how it is, but with a MUCH LONGER response time for drones.
---
So, those who are not botting or AFK ratting wont be fucked.
---
Myrm can't pull the same ticks as a vni, a domi with 3x inertial stabs, shield boosters, 4 dda's and 3 hyperspatial 1's can pull nearly the same ticks as the old vni
---
fax? (since you already have a carrier/dread pilot)
---
Next time, save a screenshot of the barcode or the code itself, and/or use a better app that has backups, like authy.
---
Hit up bosbmind in game. You won't regret it!
---
4 dda's 3 inertial stabs, 3 hyperspatial rigs + shield boosters 100mn and resist mods as needed. You can get sub 8s align time and 3.14 au/s, basically a big vni with slightly less tracking
---
Spam local in ice belt systems LOL
---
50/50 chances between making a space friend or being offered a scam/pyramid scheme
---
That's a completely different point, but yeah, that's probably a really scary number to look at.
---
it is pure nerf, new VNI get same DPS as just Vexor on drones.
---
This is a pointless argument. Bots lock manually and can for sure press F manually, neither removing drone aggression nor nerfing VNIs is going to be a solution to botting.
---
AFK ratting is not affected as well, people just have to scale up to a gila or an ishtar or a myrm or a million other solutions.
---
Unless CCP comes up with a genius method of detecting input broadcasting of all sorts, this problem is not going away.
---
I was a loner for quite some time when I first joined Eve. I joined Eve University and spent some time moving about their campuses learning what the game had to offer. I'd settled into their nullsec campus in Syndicate and was flying around in my Tristan killing the belt rats one night when my insomnia was kicking up. I was bored and put a post on Facebook that I was playing Eve. To my surprise, an old mate of mine who I played Star Wars Galaxies with 5 years previous who I hadn't spoken with in years messaged me with his IGN.
---
By the end of that week I'd moved most of my stuff up to Jita and moved to Catch with my explo Proteus and set up home. Sods law my Corp mothballed after 6 weeks. I'd been introduced to this group of folks who welcomed this nullsec newbie with open arms who decided to join a Corp in Razor, then part of the CFC living in Tenal. Catch to Tenal ain't exactly next door either. I contracted these guys everything I owned to put into their carriers which they gratefully hauled all the way up north for me.
---
I joined Gladiators of Rage, the Corp I am still in today. This group of now close friends we've all been in this Corp the same amount of time which has seen us move from Tenal to Syndicate to Fountain to Deklein to Immensea to Querious to Fountain again. They supported me becoming a Fleet Commander - albeit retired now (Parenthood and Self-Employment put a real dent in my game time!) and especially for the couple of years I inherited CEO of the Corp.
---
Thanks to this great group of friends I've been through a lot with and I'm looking forward to the long overdue meetup at Fanfest!
---
yeah but tripling the cost of the most commonly used ship for max ticks is nice
---
Lol, true actually
---
So I  logged of in 2014 with two ratting Domi's in my hanger and I log on in 2019 to hear... You need to switch to ratting Domi's.... Okay this will be easy!
---
my null peashooter shoots further than your void peashooter
---
Are you actually concerned about the fact that pilots don’t need to work hard to make very minimal amounts of isk.... this post is retarded
---
They are closely linked for the game's health. Based on the declining user counts recorded by eve offline over the past years, it can reasonably be implied that the number of established people leaving in each period, is significantly higher than those being retrained.
---
If you can train him to do your RL,  you're golden.

---
The "Are you not entertained" patch. My god how far we have fallen
---
Yep, gf all round.
---
no i'm not fucking a bit salty, i'm next level salt at how deceived i have been about looking up to noco/pathetic legion for so long and then actually seeing you lot 'in action', both from the other side and in my stint in horde, and seeing a generally weak attitude to fighting for what you've worked for. then finding out that you miserable lot were basically really just the snuffed out supercap blobbers in min/amarr wz and the few of ya'll in black rise flying bling TD/cruisers/bs were just the anomalies in your coalition, not standard bearers as they appeared to be. also fuck your economic model. i am, however, taking extreme delight in tearing all your shit down with goons rn.
---
Congrats man. I knew you'd make it. They called me a meme candidate too, but I got the 4th highest vote count! Cheers and remember to keep it real.
---
Congratulations Olmeca! You deserve this win.   
---
Please keep FW in mind. We're dying out here lol.
---
If you really want to do nullsec solo, get to npc space and grind up rep to do burner missions. If you want to mine in null (big isk compared to high) you really do need to join an existing corp. Even if your whole gaming clan moves over, im not sure starting your own corp is the best vourse of action as you will miss out on the learning opportunities that arize from having a bunch of vets in your corp.
---
My advice, say fuck it, join nullsec, and if your group moves over to eve, you can at least help them with the experiences you have gained from null.
---
Null is scary at first, but once it clicks you never want to go back to hisec.
---
there's one thing i will always be serious about: fuck snuffed.
---
Apparently people are not entertained at all if 90% of them are leaving within a week.
---
In EVE people say adapt or die. What makes you think it's any different for the game itself?
---
3 Ships I would strongly advise training into and buying before moving to nullsec ... Interceptor, T3 Cruiser &amp; Cloaky Hauler (which specific one don't matter).
---
Not as much as you would think tbh, a 500mn mwd really helps.
---
I was there man, shit was unreal.
---
another PI alt so you can maybe do P3 or P4.
---
You gotta assume the Magnate is a trap right?
---
That lowsec is dead is a meme about as valid as Eve is dead. It's not as big as it was, of course, and is currently concentrated around a few FW systems, but you can regularly get fights.
---
Another point about nullsec. If you're in a nullsec alliance, try FCing instead of F1 monkeying around. It is much more involved since you have to know how to maneuver your fleet around, find another fleet to engage and a lot of other skills.
---
So glad you made it man. Went with you over the boiler plate Brave candidate list. You had me when you said you were pro explosions. Now go get us some more!
---
What we have here is data that has no context or explanation of boundaries.
---
So for instance, we have no idea how many unique users these numbers reference. Is this just a couple people rolling new seed alts for every corner of WH space? Is this a popular RMT site rolling throw aways to deliver products?
---
We don't know why they left. Half of the drop off could be CCP bans for all we know.
---
We don't know how these numbers compare to say a random week in 2006, or 2012. Are we retaining players at a lower or higher rate? 
---
We don't even know the definition of retention. Since your character never "dies" unless doomheim, and you can log in as Alpha, this data is virtually worthless.
---
Don't even get me started on the Corax. That thing is useless.
---
Since CCP had officially killed hisec mission running (along with 50% of subscribed carebear), your statement is true since the only place people print isk is from nullsec and people really don't care how isk inflate anymore.
---
New copy-pasta for the biography of an alt, thanks for the effort of typing all this. :)

I’m surprised the goon fleet didn’t keep shooting their own structure tbh
---
༼ つ ◕‿◕ ༽つ HAPPY BIRTHDAY! ༼ つ ◕‿◕ ༽つ
---
Jesus Christ, just dock up or approach a spot in space you brain-dead assholes.   
---
If you can't do the bare minimum to stay alive you're fair game.
---
OP is actually the victim in this video. He's angry about it being posted and wants it removed from YouTube, as well as wanting havoc kicked from test.
---
If you check his post history a few months ago he got banned for botting not long after being featured as the victim in another YouTube video. That was probably a coincidence but now he's paranoid and doesn't want CCP's attention brought to his ratting activities I guess.
---
Is that a volcano under the sheets or are you excited?
---
Both have traffic, too.
---
Carrier Ratting is still a thing.  You just lose more fighters because it is harder to keep them constantly moving even with the right hotkeys and celestial orbits.
---
Battleship and Cruisers tend to get targeted first so drones are a lot safer in regard.
---
Then they are part of the problem.
---
They will do that into gilas! another great low skill afk ratter
---
"with more organization" generally means they are not independent.
---
Flair checks out
---
Void their range!
---
Nullify their insurance!
---
Congratulations man. Personally I think you're a pretty ideal candidate for this CSM because you are more than aware of the biggest problems nullsec and the game in general are facing, as well having an obvious grasp on gameplay mechanics and creative problem solving
---
You mean the ishtar right
---
There wasn't really much TIDI. 
---
Was a really fun fight, let's do it again!
---
Good thing it doesnt matter because CCP, but at least the members represent the cancer of the game. So we can expect nothing (as usual) or more cancer. If the game dies faster, we win faster.
---
one artificially inserts ISK to the game, inflating the currency and the other is doing the opposite due to taxes.
---
ECM is alive and well. You cant target the ship.
---
wrong; one generates isk from nothing (bounties) and the other generates isk from another player (sales). This is a massive difference.
---
Do you have any proof what so ever of your claims?
---
Napkin math says you save around 2m per run of 10 in increased ME and no invention. So if you run it nonstop, probably about 10 years.
---
Dumb. But what problem is it trying to fix?
---
Dude how the fuck are you so wholesome.   Your either a very dangerous person or the humblest sole in eve.  o7  congrats man.
---
There was a gif of a Domi with spinners.
---
I am unable to find it, but it was a thing.
---
They could have baked in to show DPS and range as well and this would have been perfect.
---
Way to half arse it, CCP :(
---
One creates money out of thin air, the other creates ships. No real difference
---
Yey. I voted for you line many others after seeing the whaler doc. I share your vision
---
Love the video but are anyone elses eyes bleeding now?
---
What did I miss? what happened to VNI? It's my favourite ship!
---
Why not just make rats shoot drones that are killing them, instead of ignoring them. It seems to work for WH ratting well enough that you can't AFK it.
---
CJ you really don't know shit just be quiet.
---
Tactical feed just like yours. We were sacrificing ourselves for the one we find that doesn't end up on zkb.
---
Immune for x seconds after jumping?
---
We make up a huge chunk of the player base and believe it or not, we want the game to get better, not see stupid shit like gold ammo.
---
!#we are the 0.0000001%
---
It *was* pooting out the front end of a projector at EVE North or whatever that con is called.
---
I had your back. Next time try harder :D
---
Tbh the possibility of semi-afk ratting is on of the allures of Eve for me. Set up my VNI/Domi/whatever on one screen, do some actual work on the other. Once site is finished, do what I have to do to set up the next one, then go back to work. Respond to neuts if I need to. Gets me more than enough to fund my weekend pvp, while not interrupting my workflow during the week. The isk/hr is trash compared to, say carrier/super ratting, but that's the price of not being fully attent.
---
I think a lot of people are more or less in the same boat. If CCP wants to disrupt non-botting (semi-)AFK ratting, I don't understand why, because the isk/hr is so trash I doubt it has a real impact in the game. Not to mention that there is a better chance of catching this kind of ratter if attention slips for long enough, which judging by the number of times I've just left my VNI orbitting an empty site for like 10mins is quite frequent.
---
If instead they want to disrupt botting, this doesn't seem like the right place to start.
---
and by the time you know what ammo you need the targets ever closer or to far away.
---
and where does the money for the ships come from?
---
do they count people that made a toon, loaded up a skill queue on an alt account and then didn't touch it for a long time? That could explain a lot of the 1st day  drop off... though it's still alarming.
---
Shame they considered that an exploit, it was such clever emergent gameplay
---
Are they spinning up a new Project Discovery thing?
---
Thinking I had an aggro timer and not jumping the gate I was literally bumping.
---
I did not have an aggro timer.
---
I died.
---
Thanks for a great fight Panfam!
---
VNIs going from being the ratters being ganked in anoms to being the ones ganking ratters in anoms.
---
Yeah lol, plus it got better at blitzing highsec DED cause you go in active tanked, blasters ripping things apart, drones cleaning up.
---
Some people collect BPO's just to own them
---
I had that issue and they had solved it within 4hrs of submitting my ticket
---
Matterall pretty much dropped his slimmer chances in to a vat of radiactive chemicals when he waffled on the gold ammo question.
---
It has the exact same damage with a better tank and more application in scram+web range to frigates now in PVP, and it's probably better for solo Abyss PVE. It only really got nerfed in the way that people use it for low input ratting.
---
Do you mean goons will now be dropping titans to save their ratting domis? GG
---
Now you can fly a VNI without the stigma of being called a krabber.
---
The market is actually the closest thing this game has to "normal" gameplay. Every MMO let's you play the market to make money.
---
The "Normal" gameplay in this game is actually an extremely narrow, specific niche form of gameplay.
---
Wrong he's already won
---
Nice, thank you I requested Reload changes on their forums. \^\^
---
Absolutely nobody will blacklist you for joining one of the big null bloc hordes and then leaving to go play with your clan when they decide to start a corp.  Well, at least, if they judge you, you should look deeper into that.  (TBF, the reverse is somewhat true as well: people *will* ask you questions about that, but they'll ask you questions about everything.)  The point here is that some of the big groups like Karmafleet or Pandemic Horde have approximately no input screening.  The assumption is that everyone is compromised, and things are compartmentalized appropriately.  (Oddly enough, I get the impression that Brave Newbies might actually be more selective, these days, but I also haven't lived in null in several years.)  This will give you a good security blanket while you learn about the realities of living in null.  They also tend to impart basic knowledge pretty freely because it's in their interest to retain people.
---
Another alternative is to go talk to E-Uni (EVE University).  They have a nullsec campus, along with their hisec, lowsec, and wormhole campuses.  They also, importantly, are particularly interested in educating people.  Sometimes they retain people, but they also are clear-eyed about being a stepping stone.  https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Campuses
---
Once your clan figures out what they want to do, you can then go back to them with greater understanding and hopefully help them be more successful than they would be otherwise.
---
Removing AFK drone ratting means more people will just use bots.  No one wants to manually spam click for 20 M per tick.
---
We need eve to look cool during actual combat. More cinematics and stuff like a complete overhaul of the overview. Ship analyzer should be built in button on every ship which will give an augmented reality kind of overlay showing weapon types and other features when you look at a ship from a distance.
---
I suspect the reason auto-aggro is such an issue is because most rat's AIs are still as dumb as a bag of socks. Upgrade the rat AIs to variants of CCP's latest AIs and I think you'd be surprised at the up-scale in challenge.
---
Did you use the [account recovery form](https://secure.eveonline.com/forgotpassword.aspx) to submit your request?  If not, you might do that.
---
Doesn’t matter got content
---
Haha dude you clearly have not interacted with this guy in game at all. He's a 180 degree reflection of his reddit posts. I've never seen a more vitriolic or hateful person in all my time playing EVE, and I'm not talking about anything he actually does in game (excavator stealing, etc). I mean his hour long rants in local where he comes completely unhinged. You can probably find some screencaps people have collected. The guy is legitimately fucking insane.
---
What are the odds eve is around in 10 years?
---
Plus it can fit a cyno. ;)
---
Hyperspatial rigs, mate.
---
Ratting bounties or blue loot, that’s where pretty much all isk comes from
---
FINALLY.  A content meme
---
Ecm was removed? Say hi to that falcon jamming you from 70k. I guess lock him while your damped?
---
Makes me wonder how the capacitor mod strengthening is gonna go, dual rep C3 ratting VNIs?
---
It was goons, the FC did have to tell certain special dudes to stop shooting it.
---
You may be right, but Hilmar specifically said on a TIS interview that he intended to make the game a lot less safe.
---
Hilmar has an idea for a new game.
---
It sounds like you're being sarcastic? But...
---
This is the final result. Next year, hopefully!
---
Don't think that's the issue here.
---
The majority of those new players that quit before day 7 didn't do so because they got blown up in highsec due to suicide ganking. Also the areas where they usually stay during that time period have rules that prohibit griefing.
---
So i think CCP is right on the money as to why the majority of those players quit, the game just didn't look appealing during those first few days, and the UI was too complex for people to understand.
---
Yeah I wonder, my current single rep active armor one can blitz Serpentis Watch which has 1550 raw dps in the second pocket.

Regardless,  the csm does not function like that the ccp have ideas, present it to the csm as a focus group,  they offer suggestions to improve change or shut-down the idea while offering incite on why it's not a 'i want x to change ' and ccp does so
---
They said in the presentation that those numbers do not include alts.
---
They need an actual storyline, with voice acting and such, nothing huge of course, but something to keep those players in the game long enough for them to find a group to join with.
---
Saving a spot for feedback.
---
Nah they’ll just go back to using myrms
---
Create a spy and get some revenge.
---
&gt;Nerfing ships commonly used by botters is the ultimate surrender by CCP. They obviously are incapable of handling bots.
---
Yeah, they won't be able to prevent botting. Instead of working on an anti-cheat, they will just nerf whatever most botters use. So we will probably see changes to drones, more anomaly nerfs and the removal of local.
---
At some point botters would just switch to abyssal or back to mission running bots.
---
Some people here don't even understand that botting has nothing to do with afk ratting. A bot does not afk rat, it actively targets webbing/pointing frigates and could also clear those anomalies with non-drone ships if needed.
---
If there were no goons, there would be no olmeca. Relax dude.
---
Yeah that first day. Looks like people made an account and then forgot about it.
---
Kind of ironic coming from some some random karmafleet pubbie
---
Drone auto aggression must go. maybe make a high slot module people have to use to give drone auto aggression but nerfs drone damage output to similar levels as auto-targetting missiles?
---
After so many hours of rage rolling with no content, the first thing that pops up on scan is getting tackled, trap or not.

Its a shitty t2 bpo. But a collector might buy it. Best of luck.

Widow was great for hunting caps, jam drones into oblivion.

I guess Toni is your version of Nidia Masters, lol

1v1 ECM isnt overbearing. It's useless

So... 0 isk for 0 risk under a super umbrella?

Does that 2nd pocket have 1550 dps in it? I sig tank my Astero when i go in there so i didn't realize it was that much.
---
Yeah but that's standing still with no resists lol. [Stats](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/site_view.php?id=171)
---
hahahahahahahahaha
---
If you don't plan on afk ratting then get into abyssal sites instead.
---
We need to talk about what the word thriving means
---
Let’s see, current player numbers are smaller then normal summer in NA, and that’s after the Chinese server got added to us. I’m sure all the “Reeeeeee, eve is dying” is completely unwarranted.
---
Whats your strat for making isk? I've been mining pyroxene and saving up but it's slow work at 700k isk a haul.
---
Nah man, can’t make a stork without a corax
---
Provide proof?
---
Thats fucking right...  ive never interacted with olmeca hence why i said "he could be a dangerous person".
---
Wouldn't be the first time
---
I played for a few years never finding people I really enjoyed flying with, then saw an ad for zap blap mining co. My hours were a bit weird, but there were always great guys to talk to and hang around. Two of the directors were fantastic guys (Zillian and Baldoo). 
---
They taught me a ton about playing eve. More than anything they taught me that real life always trumps the game. I left the corp quite some time ago and I’ve let most of my accounts lapse. We still get together and talk from time to time, I miss playing those guys. I know that when my life gets a little simpler I’ll always have friends to come back to and to lean on.
---
cool great to hear! post your griffin navy issue km since changes.
---
I don't play anymore, but it would be nice if that fancy fighter UI and control scheme got used in more of the game (why the fuck did they put so much work into a gameplay mechanic, very few people by percentage will even use? Then again, that's describing basically anything capital sized in this game). "Fighter-like" drones would meet all your noted requirements. It would also be more interesting gameplay, I guess?
---
You could still have some degree of separation if you want fighters to continue to feel different to drones. Less weapons and functionality, but cheaper and easier to spam? Drones probably don't need torpedo launchers or short-range warp. They can probably continue to use the bandwidth mechanic to maintain the same flexibility, while keeping the static fighter tubes away from drones.
---
Stop botting then :D
---
Dude, who cares? It's not like this isn't just going to be business as usual anyway.
---
If *you* understood how it worked chori wouldn't steal your shit constantly.
---
What has that got to do with this? Olmeca gold should be able to exist without goons getting triggered because they fear the way of the krab might be weakened by his mere presence within the CSM.
---
\&gt;People want feature parity with POSes.  
---
\&gt;People complain about tethering on POS replacements when its 98% the same as sitting in a bubble  
---
Like come the fuck on. Yeah, you can get bowled out, which is an exploit. You can also have the access list fucked with on a structure.
---
You mean the ship that shouldnt exist as is because it was designed after it was well known that ECM was a problem?
---
Balance is more important and if CCP is too retarded to make a couple of changes, fuck that ship.
---
I honestly can say I have no clue who that is. Sorry.
---
Since I am not the person talking about ways to reduce either (I think both are terrible for the game btw), I'm not the one to ask. Maybe ask the OP.
---
pls be a dread
---
&gt; Nah they’ll just go back to using myrms
---
...which also have cynos on the fits.
---
exactly, hence ratting has fundamentally different effect to the economy than industry and mining
---
Not really.  Just start orbiting the next target when you are one shot away from the current
---
I made a few friends in Estonia of all places, went and visited them and enjoyed 2 euro beers at the pub in Tartu, after I went to fanfest, I went to fanfest like 3 times in Iceland, and had a great time every time, tho not many still play eve much if at all, I do try to keep in touch with people.
---
One day I'll make the trip to New Orleans tho and try to catch up with Oldma, and smash some crawdads and other southern foods.
---
what if you as a player had the option to grind certain necessary skills in game? I feel like new players are most put off by training time ( I certainly was for a long time). What if you could, in a way similar to the current NPE, train all of your big 14 skills and maybe your racial frigate to V throughout ingame tasks/epic arcs?
---
An [Astero](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75889832/) once popped up on scan.
---
Rather hilariously it wound up unironically becoming content when we saw [the pod kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75889841/)
---
More importantly when will that Yan guy start making videos?

\+1 for effort
---
I don't have to leave the compare tool window pinned anymore! ?
---
That would be like 4 of my alts, 2 that I forgot the password on, one Jita alt I’m too lasy to use, and one I made for Init’s alpha ferox army when I was with them.
---
Yep he got nerve pretty hard
---
you are an idiot
---
if you can get a pos password you can steal the titan. 
---
you can also bowl the titan out. a corpmate with access can steal the titan. POSes are not a good enough option.
---
I met the legendary Quickswipe Collier. He took me under his wing when I was but a newbro and expanded my knowledge of high risk looting and scamming/corporation infiltration. It was a great fucking time.
---
Okay thanks, that may have to do with memorization of the sites.  I seem to lose 1 fighter on certain triggers. Overall you don't see rats targeting drones in most rat sites unlike targeting fighters in carrier ratting.  They tend to attack the ship using drones which calls back on NPC mechanics.
---
I recommend watching few youtube pvp guides. Try to find ones that are fairly recent and have lots of views so the content is good.
---
Few good channels:  [https://www.youtube.com/user/ChessurSB](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChessurSB)

That's hot
---
it wasn't an exploit till someone did it to BoB
---
lmao chori, the guy who's in this thread complaining about loot script makes me wonder one thing.
---
Was he the FC of the fleet you robbed? hahahaha
---
See, if you assume every ratter/miner that is awake is a bot, then of course you see bots everywhere. But telling an awake person from a bot is hard. So alliances assume people are real until proven otherwise.
---
A PH director who takes pretty much zero BS from anyone. Lots of people say he’s an asshole but as long as you don’t do anything to deserve it then he won’t go off on you, and in a Corp as big as ours you need people making sure that everyone follows the rules.
---
Was yes
---
It's hard for you and you are projecting.
---
you seem bitter, like a bitter baby mama or ex girlfriend that got shunned by th guy, stop your crying. youre not a teenaged girl, (although you may be by the way youre crying all over this thread) so stop acting like one. arent you in your mid 20s?

Stages of Player Retention 
---
First week:  
---
"Oh I think I signed up for this game" &gt; doesn't bother to actually play the game  
---
"Wtf how do i play this game?" &gt; quit  
---
"Oh the game is not the action-ish kind like Ace Combat or Star Fox or Galaxy on Fire." &gt; quit  
---
"Alright I need to buy sub to unlock stuff, screw that." &gt; quit  
---
"Dang I need to buy skill injectors or wait for months to unlock that bad ass ship." &gt; quit
---
Later:  
---
"I fucked up, lost everything I saved up, guess that's it." &gt; quit  
---
"PVP is fun but I'm scared of losing the hard-earned money I made with 1-2m sp on high sec" &gt; quit  
---
"I'm here for PVE not PVP" &gt; mine or rat for weeks then quit
---
It's whack a mole now. Fix one thing, a half dozen more pop up.
---
Go take a lap.
---
My idea is stupid as all of my ideas, but I would do away with all combat sites and replace with local pirates mini-incursions. System-wide, instead of constellation-wide. I don't know how many of them or how quickly they would last each, but Guristas incursions, Blood Raiders incursions, Serpentis incursions would be interesting in my stupid opinion.
---
I have been a member of Fweddit since, essentially, the beginning of my EVE adventure. I'm probably going on near four or five years now. There are many people in fweddit that I consider close online friends. 
---
I love you csaw, friendrer, Shy, Niv, Cas. &lt;3
---
Half the reason i don't use projectile is right here.
---
I suppose the 15,000 bans they gave out is them unwilling to solve the problem. It isn't possible to solve the problem when someone can just make a new account and go back to bot farming with an alpha clone. The botter loses literally nothing and CCP gains literally nothing. Had the VNI been omega only, there wouldn't be nearly as many bots. 
---
Not to mention, that's not even the real issue. The real issue is that there's no difference between a bot in a VNI and a real player multi-boxing 10 VNIs. The reason there's both been no effective ideas from the players on how to fix the botting issue that wouldn't also ruin the game for half the real player-base AND no effective response from CCP is because.... wait for it.... there ISN'T ONE. 
---
I don't know how it is that this entire community can pretend they have an imaginary PHD because they play EVE, but aren't smart enough to realize that no matter what CCP does to the game, EVE is just too easy to bot. 
---
Oooooh just make drones not auto agro, that'll fix it! - No, all that does is end AFK farming, which is a good thing, but it wouldn't do anything for bots. What? Do we live in an imaginary world where you think it's impossible for a bot to be programmed to click a target and press "F".
---
People need to start separating botting and AFK farming. Both are real issues, but the solutions are completely different; arguably nonexistent for the former.
---
-50 drone bandwidth
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c3sg75/vexor_navy_issue_revamp/
---
Overall a nice little buff to most non-ratting VNIs, but a death-blow to the 100MN AFK ratter fit.
---
Should be the manta when it comes to anythin CCP says.
---
Don't forget you can do the same with a wreck in between waves
---
Bots are thriving at least.
---
I suggest you find a different Corp.. If you force yourself into a role you wont enjoy this game wont remain fun for very long,  if you want to mine find a diff Corp that mines
---
depends , do you have another character that can run missions or do you need to start from scratch ? if starting form scratch use dotland , find a corp that has enough lvl 4 locators to your liking , then run missions for that corp that has a "generic storyline" lvl agent in the same system and the corp standing will increase quickly
---
All jokes aside, he's the one I'm actually shocked about. Is his only claim to fame stealing excavators? His system is genius, but he'd be a weird player representation for the game.
---
The Scimitar is the best part.
---
Perfectly stupid, as all CCP mechanics should be
---
To be fair when dont we have to tell specials to "dont shoot the cididel you moron or your primary "
---
no mentioned of me donating 10b to your corp :(
---
WORLD ARK FIGHT! YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENS!
---
Yeah, for about a minute, which is how long it takes for a new meta to be developed and adopted by literally everyone. 
---
I guarantee that the moment CCP announced the change, every alliance in the game was working on the VNI's replacement.
---
Holy shit you understood that...
---
Pretty much that. You buy in the place where the stuff is cheap and sell where it is in demand. Most regions have roughly the same prices inside them, with some exceptions like Forge where you can move stuff to Jita and back from it for a reasonable profit (though Jita is highly populated and, as a result,  dangerous). I moved stuff between Placid and the other region that is neighboring Dodixie. The stuff I traded had a massive difference in price between regions, so the overall this was quite profitable, even accounting lost hauler.
---
I just realized I used the "Heavy Beam Laser" and not its larger cousin. I revise my estimate to be sometime after hell freezes over.
---
 &gt;Is it even POSSIBLE to escape in a ship such as a Hecate?
---
Not if the garmur pilot doesn't make mistakes. Assuming you're blaster fit, you're pretty much the prime target for a garmur.
---
I believe he is an IT executive for a TV network.
---
Slingshotting doesn't always work, and the garmur is great in eve because of it's braindead ability to kite SUPER far away, and apply damage at said range.
---
There are two methods mainly of slingshotting:
---
1) To slingshot into scram/web range of the ship kiting you, allowing you to kill it, or...
---
2) To slingshot away from the ship kiting you, causing him to drop point and allow you to warp off.
---
Both of these methods are done by initially burning against the direction you want to go (In the case of #1, burning away from the ship, and in the case of #2, burning into the ship), and then quickly, doing a 180 and burning as fast as possible in the direction you want to go. There are countermeasures another pilot can take, and if he is manually piloting and good he can pretty much negate most, if not all of a slingshot.
---
If you're trying to pull off #2, on your exit burn try and burn directly to a celestial and spam warp out.
---
It shouldn't need to be said, but overheating modules will help you, whether it's your MWD, your tackle mods, or whatever.
---
This being said, solo pvp is a meme and most matchups are set in stone, and once you gain a baseline proficiency with a ship it's nigh impossible to lose engagements in your favor.
---
这对你没有帮助 &lt; hopefully google got it somewhat right
---
No one is dumb enough to pay 55b for that. Do you even make money building those? Because I don't think you make money building those. My offer is 100m.
---
It just seems like it would either have a very minimal effect or eliminate drones as viable system entirely for PVE purposes.
---
Ooops
---
As a lot of people have mentioned, you should join an established group. When moving the nullsec I would generally advise to liquidate all of your assets, then hop into a travel interceptor (immune to warp disruption bubbles). Then simply use that alliance's logistics services to move assets to your staging location, or simply buy new ships. Trying to move all of your stuff to nullsec by yourself is a good way to lose all of your shit.
---
Another option if you want is to go to Providence and fly in that region as a neutral. The inhabitants of Providence will not engage you unless you give reason to shoot you. Though I would still not recommend doing this because everyone else uses Providence as a hunting ground AND there is a fariy decent conflict/war going on there now. 
---
Also as a general note of advice, I would start getting into pvp like asap. The more you know how to hunt and fight the better you are able to defend your vulnerable ships (miners). Plus pvp is a lot more fun and engaging than mining.
---
I took a Heron bait the other day, it was a fight on a hi-sec hole so there was a way out for me, as I was on the hole, and they where a bit further out.
---
To be fair, orcas in highsec are not worth killing no matter the numbers,  its easily one of the 'safest' highsec ships
---
Very bad
---
no hate just facts
---
Okay, that's what I was doing, and made about 50 attempts to do so over the 20 minutes with no luck, shoulda turned repper off and saved myself 20 minutes.
---
But as a thought experiment, lets assume he's human (to be honest I'm not certain garmur pilots count) and thus can make mistakes.
---
Assuming we're all flying non a horizontal plane, with my target celestial on +ve X axis, at which point in his orbit should I attempt to fly to -ve X and then back to +ve X? 
---
Also in response to your last point, I killed this pilot in a prior engagement so he got his Garmur and came back and 3rd partied me while i fought someone else. I am NEVER fighting this ship intentionally, they always just turn up.
---
Nice I will add this to my commute
---
If you haven't seen his mini documentary [The Whaler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb9HR5ij_-w) you should really check it out. He's done more than just steal excavators, but even if that's all it was, he bascially created the method by which a small group of subcaps can slow down rorquals.  He know the game well, and he's great at devising methods to achieve what he wants, which many people think will mean that he'll be able to identify and help solve problems in the game that larger entities (i.e. Imperium) benefit from. I think there are a lot of people who think he's going to singlehandedly "fix" the game, but I hope that he'll serve as some fresh blood and a different approach to make it better at the very least.
---
This war is getting good, gonna pop some popcorn and be in a few PanFam fleets.
---
Lol afk farming of the toughest pvp content in the game
---
Do you really want to warp to 15km away from a gate again?
---
Would be totally way too much to fix the fucking rats or spawn rate. /s
---
I agree but it is silly that they have let this loophole go unchecked for so long. Really makes no sense to nerf a navy ship basically into the tech 1 version
---
You zig when they zag.
---
All they have to do is add one stais tower to the damn thing with a 100km range and it’s solved
---
&gt;Assuming we're all flying on a horizontal plane, with my target celestial on +ve X axis, at which point in his orbit should I attempt to fly to -ve X and then back to +ve X?
---
You're thinking too hard, if you want you can do the vector math yourself on this one, but in general https://i.imgur.com/bdCc9sm.png
---
You are going to win and lose the majority of your solo pvp fights in eve depending solely on your engagement profile. Slingshotting is a last ditch effort to try and eek out a win and only works in specific cases when. All you can do is try and hope they're retarded, fit retarded, or you're in the dozen or so engagements that it works.
---
Wow, angry.
---
Keep a 50mn anti kite fit in your cargo. When you see a Garmur refit to it. Get caught on purpose. Wait a bit without prop on till he gets comfortable, then approach him at 10km/s laughing heretically.
---
Looks like we should buy some rattlesnakes tonight price should inflate on those pretty fast
---
Yeah and get blapped by a Vexor.
---
Don't blame me.   I voted for Kotos
---
Slingshot can't be used when the other ship has superior agility or range dictation ability.
---
Bots don’t care on drone aggro
---
I get what you're saying, but I'd may as well try, I had plenty of time to give it a go.
---
When your so scarred your fingers are literally shacking.
---
it also fixes botting, because CCP tracks bots via two methods
---
1) input tracking
---
2) active time slots
---
for #1, VNI botting has a good 15 inputs an hour, and it's nigh impossible to get a definitive pattern based off of that
---
for #2, the only bots they catch are the ones going 12+ hours a day for more than 4 hours a week. They flag people who do this, and manually investigate it a couple times a month.
---
 And how much cheaper do you suppose it will get? Even a Damavik is around 55m right now and that an awful lot for a frigate.
---
... you've just injected a half dozen VNI alts, the day before they announce the death of the VNI.
---
I just play on Steam because I like having my accounts together. I think I do have sense but prove me wrong if I do not.
---

---
"B-but I'm a friend of the Mittani!"
---
 The best thing to do is ignore those sites. You're pretty much gank bait doing wormhole combat sites solo, and the isk is rather bad for the investment. Relic sites are the way to go for sure.
---
Base SP should be 2M or have all Magic 14 trained to lvl4.
---
Who the fuck is iron armada?
---
Yeah, Vily is not a goon candidate, no sir! 
---
Test is an independent alliance and they have free shots to prove it!
---
He's not a goon. That's his bias.
---
 Your fit isn't that bad. You're probably making a piloting mistake. What is killing you?
---
&gt;I get what you're saying, but I'd may as well try, I had plenty of time to give it a go.
---
I never at any point, didn't say "don't try".
---
I'm simply saying it doesn't always work, so you should manage your expectations.
---
Pretty stupid theory, but thanks for sharing it.
---
Lmao
---
No. Approach won't save you from bumping. And docking is not always an option. Bumping needs to be changed because it has *no viable counter*.  
---

---
Good to see you there Olmeca. i can't agree more with your message that CSM providing a unified message to CCP is of utmost importance and to rise above partisanship and work with ALL other CSM partners for betterment of the game.
---
&gt; UI was too complex
---
because the default layout is ass. biblical levels of ass. actually absurd how much work they put into the new player experience without making the default ui usable.
---
I voted for you to piss other people off, dont let me down.
---
"For some use cases [Titan bridging] starbase forcefields are 'safer' than an Upwell Tether."  
---
"Mooring would be a new optional tether state."  
---
"Pilots would be able to choose to 'Moor' much like they can choose to safe log"  
---
"While moored you are prevented from leaving tether range"  
---
Also: https://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/67008/1/Mooring_550.jpg
---
Technically you already are immune on session changes, which is why you don't bounce instantly.
---
Yeah its wild, but im really digging that bifrost. Haha
---
The real hero
---
My expectation is death. Any non-zero chance of survival is an improvement.
---
You dont see a problem with yet another fucking bullshit mechanic that keeps people safer?
---
I can't tell if this is a joke or not.
---
EVE is too fucking safe, thats one of the reasons why we're where we are, Tether needs to be outright removed, not adding a second version that stops you from being bumped off.
---
&gt;What did you do for Lowsec\\FW as CSM? stop pretending to be a expert. you suck at this game and we all hate you.
---
You've basically described pvp there.
---
Congrats Olmeca Gold, may the wind be in your favor.
---
I'm honestly surprised the VNI nerf took this long.  They previously nerfed lots of ratting metas including the Gila and the Isk-shtar.  The beat goes on.
---
I know it was an example but please don't go as low as 3 shared folders.  
---
As a wormholer my corp has 12 folders and I know groups with more.
---
I think this is a good idea, but only if CCP makes it so those skills cannot be extracted.
---
Goons are allowed to get triggered. It's all part of them vs us mentally.
---
How many tricks did you turn to afford that skin???
---
?
---
OK... Who doesn't have one, honestly? I feel like every bitter-vet out there only plays the game for the friends they made along the way. Certainly not for the game itself. I still have contact with a few of my old gang even now, 12 years in the game, some won EvE long ago, but still in touch via facebook, some - even active today. No longer in the same corp with any of them, but we still our old corp recruitment channel as a hang-out between all of us, whenever we are on. Or whenever someone comes back for another spell and hey, there we all still are. 
---
My not so usual story I already wrote at least twice. 
---
My first PvP losses were in Nalvula, northern low-sec. Lost a Caracal to Japanese pirates living there back in 2007,  Mugen Industry. That Caracal was like a third of all ISK I had at the time. I think I was trying to do a mission there, got caught on a gate... then got a new one, another third of all my ISK, and a couple of days leter went to lows again, to hunt for belt-rats I think, got cought in a belt. After the second caracal blown up by the same guys - one of them links in local "guide to how to survive in low-sec". I read it. That was the last time I had lost anything I was not prepared to lose since then. Years in lows and null, multiple wars won and lost, countless engagements. The lesons I had learned from those guys and that link - gave the solid foundation for my EvE.
---
A couple of years later, when I was part of the IRC/ED vs RA&amp;Co war, I saw that very same guy who gave me the link - in our fleet. I was in a logi, he broadcasted for reps, I thought I recognised the name, clicked on him - Mugen Industry, who at the time joined ED for fun and giggles. Convoed him after the battle, thanked him for the guide. He was surprised, but highly amuzed. He quit eve a year later. KB suggests he came back three years after that for a couple of years more, but his last kill is from 2014, so it seems that he had finally won EvE for good.
---
Hey I'm actually jealous I didn't think of it first. I could have bought me a Tesla with that cash.
---
Are they tracking accounts or characters or IP addresses? My first toon (Karmic Ozzie, RIP) I biomassed, don't remember why. My current toon used to be a hauler alt and I started running missions with that one to kill time and build SP. My 3rd I biomassed because I didn't really like the name. (And lost 5m SP.) I wonder what they do track as far as what counts? I'm still playing but have used a few different accounts to get everything where I want. I think giving a new player a lot more info about racial ships, weapons, etc might help some.
---
 Basically make the learning curve more of a mountain instead of a cliff. It can still be steep, but as it stands now it can be very discouraging for new players. And please change the default UI and overview, because the defaults suck. (Giant thanks to JohnnyPew for a brilliant UI layout that I shamelessly copied and the z-s overview that I used to modify and make my own.)
---
Perhaps you should've tried harder, tbh.
---
In Dunk we trust 7o
---
Exactly everyone will just move to an ishtar
---
I think that they're trying to fix the Ns ratting but they're not really helping us by doing that they're making it become more of a super cup game now they're going to make us get the carriers just to go ratting
---
Honestly even a custom UI is too complex for a new player.
---
What CCP needs to figure it out is how to filter the UI to what a new player actually needs to look at an pay attention to, and ignore what isn't important.
---
Too many ways to distract and confuse the player in the UI during the first few days.
---
But again tackling the UI issue won't be enough. Too many new players quit the game at the beginning not only because they found the game too complicated, but also because they found it boring and not interesting enough.
---
And I honestly think that the only way to achieve that cool factor to get people hooked on the game is to provide them with a short cinematic story at the beginning. With more voice acting and such.
---
In fact i'd like to see the numbers from CCP about the new player retention from before they introduced that tutorial with the voice acting (the one where your character was in some kind of battlefield between the navy and the drifters) And what happen immediately after that. 
---
Maybe i'm wrong and that did literally nothing, but when i first played through that section i was really impressed with it, and i think my experience when i started the game (back in 2013, i quit in the second day only to come back a week later) probably would have been quite different had I played through a sequence like the one that they introduced.
---
They could do that, but it doesnt really matter. They need to fix the spawn rates before the game dies even more.
---
buy glamor 75% drug and do the data centre missions for a chosen faction. ez clap, you have a locator now.
---
If a bot only warps to a site and finishes it...then leaves...how is that profitable if he doesn't take the look IE faction mode if they drop?. Just seems like a waste of time to me.
---
That's the Eve spirit!
---
Depends on the cruiser, but yes
---
Hey, fair enough and I hope he has a successful csm run. I mean, he personally stole my excavators and I couldn't even get mad considering how well he executed it within the few seconds I wasn't looking.
---
&gt; i quit in the second day only to come back a week later
---
It was the same for me, but my second (final) try was like 10 months later.
---
I agree with your point about cinematics and showing off the 'cool' of Eve. This is why, I think, the "This is EVE" trailer was so good, because it showed off the cool that this game can be.
---
Against a Garmur, yes. Just being realistic.
---
Against anything else I'm very happy to go down in a ball of fire.
---
They were fairly specific, it's new accounts and new characters on this account
---
Stop looking for a pacifier to comfort yourself with--even if you pretend 90% of these accounts are basically bots just to make yourself feel better, that still means 9 out of the 10 new players you bring in quit within 3 months
---
They need to scrap CSM, and bring back ISD but with better oversight. Player retention would go the fucking moon.
---
Yeah, with me i started the game and then quit due to getting lost in the game and bored, then the battle of Asakai happened, got hyped up about the game again, so decided to give it a real shot at it and reinstalled it.
---
I ended up spending a fuckton of money flying to Norway from Washington State and fastboating some Fjords to hang out with my eve bro and his family. Get to know their culture. Eat food drink beer. It was fucking awesome and I will never regret it.
---
There is so much isk already in the system that you wouldn't feel that for years.
---
Well you can’t extract until you have 5m SP anyways which is the cap for alphas too
---
Also, RIP armor bait VNIs
---
As long as he's not as bad as mitts - he's good.
---
well dude ecm drones still exist and are still entirely broken, and still entirely countered by the same 'just fit a smartbomb' mechanic as they always have been, so i don't think CCP has achieved too much with the ecm changes and it needs a bigger rethink.
---
Grats to the wormhole guy that got elected!  Big surprise
---
&gt; Cladistic proving of Ancient Domain Commences

It's "Cladistic proving in the Ancient Domains commences."
---
I started playing the first week of release in 2013... and I'm still here. How many of those first weekend are still around?
---
What the fuck this is retarded
---
That is dumb. People vote based on a video they liked. How is he accountable for their actions? Would Arnie be accountable for the crimes of some violent LA thugs who voted for him because they liked him in terminator?
---
Speak for yourself. I really enjoyed VNI ratting. 1 account, paid attention, didnt afk. It was soothing after a long day in a way that mining or rattlesnake ratting is not for me.
---
I doubt this will do much to bots who will just hop in a gila or ishtar. "But Yhorm, those are much more expensive/make less." Bots do not give a shit about this. They can still warp to a safe or citadel right away, or easily scale up numbers/switch to mining, and if they dont they make so much money anyway that loss is barely a factor. The gilas might make 200 million less per day per account.
---
The only person this really hurts is the 3 or 4 month old player who is looking for a decent way to make a little more cash because their skirmish FC keeps whelping caracals.
---
Imagine, instead, doing something about the actual bot behavior of instant safe warping, intel bots networks, market bots, etc.
---
Well, i did, and he was off my ticket. :)
---
The not wanting to be a team player and work with the other candidates was the second blunder for me.
---
Sometimes you just can't win no matter what you do, you need to pick your fights(when possible).
---
Good job MEAN glad to see gentlemanly slugfests.
---
which makes sense since one super can print 10-30x what a VNI could ever hope for, with basically no regard for anything except getting a fleet hot dropped on it. 
---
VNIs can be killed with a solo cloaky hunter. Whatever replaces them can too.
---
Getting rid of AFK ratting is very important, but so is nerfing the top end of ratting.
---
ECM is indeed broken, but the game has so many issues I think one ship that was deliberately designed to use an overpowered mechanic isnt a big deal.
---
10 years later — show a slide when it’s done
---
I have never picked fights with Garmurs, they just come and 3rd party my engagements.
---
In what way?
---
Congratulations ccp, you've turned the vni into a vexor with one less gun and a rep bonus.  Thanks for that.
---
70% of Eve accounts are bots.
---
I don't know of the general CSM dudes, but the goon line members are not going to pull any punches with you if you make even the tiniest mistake, but i think you know that.
---
The reason you won was because you had a semblance of an organized candidacy with a clear message. After voting, some of the ppl (who are malcotents ... like myself) might have a semblance of buyer's remorse or might expect too much (since many don't know CSM is more of a focus group); compounding this, a lot of nullseccers (imperium mostly here) will pounce on the tiniest mistake to push an anti-you (and by extension, us) narrative ... so don't give them an opening . Might want to consider talking in local/eve channels in canned phrases.
---
Realistically the most that we can do is to show that we are a bloc just as trong as them, that we also pay for the game, and push for some changes that are less work on CCP's part (since they will probably go for less work but better impact stuff).
---
For that i think you need to work with the community to keep the momentum going, and with other ppl (including CSM) to push for ideas that will make EVE a better place, a place where there is more conflict.
---
I think the present (non)war in the north is a good example of how stale nullsec has become with these massive powerblocs, NCPL won't engage because they don't have the numbers and the new fortress delve is too strong to take down in the abscene of it's supercap defenders.
---
whoosh
---
Orthrus &gt; all.
---
If you are willing to drop 1b in the fit and stick to 3-4/10, it's by far the best ship.
---
wrong
---
sounds like a great mechanic to stop 300 caps coming through one cyno, forcing you to spread them out and or risk damage committing a huge cap force at once.
---
literally exactly what eve needs.
---
Fly something kitey yourself if it's becoming too much of an annoyance.
---
i met this eve player named "Australian Excellence" he was a pleb miner, and over the next 4 months I crafted him into a weapon to smite miners and subhumans in highsec.
---
Idk, I don’t 100% agree or like him or his opinion.
---
but he looks like he is autistic enough to get my trust that he will DO SOMETHING.
---
I voted for some lowsec and wh guys in last CSM but even with suitonia there was no change that made me very disappointed. (he had good opinion, but maybe GSM was too heavy?)
---
I don’t think there is more guy like olmeca, he is enough to get my bet on his autism.
---
A 3-4 month account can make more ISK/hr doing a lot of other things. 
---
AFK vni ratting is abused by older players running half a dozen of them while watching netflix. He doesnt care if one dies because it pays for itself in an hour of ratting. 
---
The other drone ships are actually expensive enough that its not sustainable if you loose them repeatedly
---
no u are
---
A witty joke, one entirely unique and never heard before.
---
Lol this is part of the reason eve is broken. Al those reps from major power blocks.
---
Was on an eve break, will come back next week, just saw your video and espite beibg very good what you say is important.
---
Mega empire are too big and eve not enough dangerous.
---
Keep the good work
---
Yep.
---
Not a great selection

I worked for Vile Rat.
---
You're the type of person who always kills the joke, aren't you?
---
VNIs arent even the most popular botter ship. Botters don't care what the ship is. 
---
This only hurts people that use alpha clone VNIs.
---
Renting involves paying rent. A renter is someone who rents, who pays rent. 
---
Iron doesn't pay rent. We don't fleet with Imperium. Good diplomatic efforts by our leadership let us maintain our sov we took from The Culture and others we evicted from Fountain. That is a lot more valuable than Rote's salty shit posting :)
---
Well you did a good job, I am going to get one of these for a phoenix!
---
goon f1 n+1 monkey btw
---
Because bumping stuff of citadels, especially supers and titans, is a risky and rewarding activity requiring a certain level of skill and game knowledge
---
This change buffs citadels (wtf lol) and makes owning a super/titan even safer.
---
If that’s not a retarded change idk what is
---
Can this be abused by giving people access and fuck up their grid with a ton of bookmarks?
---
Lost a 10b isk jump freighter because I was too stupid to verify I could actually dock at the structure I was cynoing to...compounded with the fact that I didn’t have an emergency cyno close enough to GTFO once the Loki locked me down.
---
Not really. If you're in a subcap the super fleet is more like concord... They will punish your attackers but they probably won't prevent your loss...
---
I'm sure CCP has the data, but I would expect that VNI ratting generates less isk then say, carrier/super rating, L5 missions and incursions... So the deflation would be very minor...
---
&gt;wait that means i dont have to have a print out on my wall of crystal ranges?
---
I still wish for something like radial menu when you hold your LMB on guns and menu with different charges appear
---
[laughs in imperial commissar]
---
&gt; It's also work
---
Not a lot of work if you control your own smtp server with a reasonably isp-ish sounding domain record.
---
Have you tried NOICE?
---
It had some down time last week too.
---
Can you clarify what risk is involved in bumping supers off of citadels? Because a couple of cheap Lifs is not "risky". Nor, for that matter, do I see any specific skill or knowledge required, beyond click target, click approach, click mwd. (Which I'll grant is hard for some people lol.)  
---
Besides, only keepstars are equal to or better than a pos for bridging, and that means ccp has to implement *some* kind of mechanic to enable bridging from smaller citadels before they can remove poses.
---
You're retarded.
---
Phat booty bump
---
Why would new players ever leave the pocket where they can fly anything with zero risk, just so they can actually not fly those ships and loose a lot of money when they inevitably blow up? It's not about the retention on paper. It's about how many people are actually interested in the game. Which has always been low. Adding features that in no way represent what the game is only retains players we don't want or need.
---
congratz!!
---
No? What's that? I am not finding anything on Google.
---
When supers cost 10.5bn for a hull it’s proportionately very risky considering your chance of success is relatively low.
---
Are you kidding there’s so much more that goes into hunting and bumping supers and titans off tether than “click target, click approach, click mwd”, in fact that’s not even in the right order?
---
It is possible to bridge from astras and shit in mostly safety, in fact non-risk averse people bridge at safes in enemy space all the time. Why the fuck must a titan be 100% safe and only “risked” in a 1000v1000 DD tidi fest?
---
That all?
---
A grade trash love it keep posting.
---
and you can't build ship with minerals only either.
---
So what ?
---
Literally so many people can be complete nutcase cockbags in game and be productive and put-together IRL.
---
 Lmfao. I've seen it a million times. Idk how you haven't.
---
to use ratting dominix !!
---
No u
---
daily quests are back on the menu, boys.
---
&gt;Even cruisers?
---
you can make the math of  40 000 \* speed/ 500 / sigradius to get the effective tracking a cruiser needs to have to deal 40% of its damage.
---
Literally
---
It is only possible to bridge from astras "safely" if you have a bail out fleet available. It is not *mechanically* safe like poses and keepstars are, and that is the important distinction. "Non-risk adverse" people are only that way because their titan is srped and they have backup.
---
we are not here to share positions in order to reach a common agreement. We are here to sperg on how the game is bad and we are better than the game designers.
---
Lol exactly it’s hard to get ahead in eve right now as a newish player. This won’t help
---
#nopoors
---
so you are saying that the rats give a variable amount of isk in their bounty, or that the roids give a fixed amount of isk, or that the gain of isk is immediate when mining.
---
Very interesting, do you have any proof of that ?
---
whats wrong with judge? i read through the some of the available minutes of CSM and he seemed pretty good?
---
So everybody is going to get Gilas or Ishtars now?
---
I feel like we have been there before but good change
---
*Ahem*  
---
Fuck goons.  
---
That is all.
---
Loot all button took 10 years to implement
---
I think if you use an alt, with 75%, it's less than an hour.
---
Honestly trying to fix the income problem will never really work. You are just handicapping new players against older players since they already have near limitless isk. 
---
The only feasible fix to inflation is hard isk income nerfs coupled with really good isk sinks to get it out of the system. Which eve really goes to have.
---
I thought the POS Bowling exploit was waayyy later cuz logged out supers were getting punted out and murdered by Machs
---
You clearly are full of spodbrain.
---
No u.
---
I've made quite a few good friends. I was changing corps and was chilling in a null bloc recruitment channel and I had a back and forth with a few guys. 
---
I decided to make my own channel for us and invited them. I made a discord and we all went on fleets together. 
---
Most of us got in to the Corp we were applying for and continued to go on fleets, mine together, etc. Some have dropped off, switched corps, etc. but I still have some great friends. 
---
Even now I still reach out to newbros who have joined the alliance and are out mining in a venture. I give them boosts and let them compress on my rorqual. Most join my channel and make friends with me or the others. It just warms my heart to bring you nerds together.
---
I've even had someone message me while we were out mining and say he was really thankful I invited him and that he got such great friends to play eve with.
---
Also you can use lower level locators but it takes longer to get the location.  Level 4 ones email you in about 4 mins.
---
You can also ask for a locate in the locates are us channel
---
Xenuria is what happens when you take the Mittani seriously.
---
9 other people with my exact weird ass ballot. You 9 people are weird.
---
My first attempt to paint something I printed.  "Sanctuary" skin.  Pretty rough, but I learned a lot.
---
I was about to call out the other weirdo with my exact same ballot, then I remember that was just my second account. Yikes.
---
So for dps it's kinda cool seeing the HP of target drop and die. In a bigger fleet it's not as much fun, you mostly try to get on kills with so much dps on field. Approach or follow FC and F1. 
---
Kiting is more work. Takes a decent understanding of eve IMO. Can be dps or tackle, its easy to make mistakes but in a gang it is a bit more forgiving. 
---
I like being useful. Logi and some ewar is really enjoyable for me. It takes some skill as you want to keep the friendly ships between you and the enemy but is more forgiving for maneuvering. 
---
I personally like the feeling of freedom (America and all)  I'm not required to anchor up with ewar and logi most of the time and can make my own decisions which is the most rewarding feeling. Boosts are a cool role if its needed but is another longer train item. 
---
As others said if your Corp can't accept an indy wing which is important, try to find something in the PvP side to help with or find a good indy Corp.
---
Alphas won't!
---
exactly what i was thinking...
---
Do it in an ishtar; you can fit and fly pretty much the same way
---
I sincerely doubt you will be able to present any of your thoughts in a respectful and coherent manner in a room full of adults.
---
lol no but ok
---
lets make the game more safe for titans and supers good idea fucking nullbear
---
Plan on selling these? How many hours did it take to print and paint?

my NPE is i had a blast with the tutorial agents and i kept seeing this level 1 security quest and i started it as soon as i finished tutorial and there were like 12 ships waiting and i warped out? now do i even log in? no clue what to do next

https://noice.catdock.org/ it's basically a NEAT fork with ESI.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
X% of all NPC bounties reduced across the board, and now, that amount is added as an NPC bounty to the player, placed by the opposing NPC faction for flavor. That bounty can be collected by players who -- fuck nvm exploitable/farmable. Lol 
---
But seriously, something like that could and should be done in such a way that, at worst, it creates an inconvenience to people who want to loophole it while not netring them positive, but sometimes people get isk off a botter who isnt scripted to dump his NPC bounties/botmaster cant be arsed to do it on all 8 accounts more than once a week.
---
We keep bridging fleets onto blue forts in tribute and people just start shooting. Like every time. It's amazing.
---
Why not modify the anoms instead of ruining the best pvp cruiser platform for drone focused pilots? 
---
So the primary drone cruiser gets a new turret it doesn't need, a rep bonus it only needs because this change forces it into blaster range to apply any real damage, and has the one thing that made it special removed...  
---
The exeq navy is hands down a better blaster boat and fills the roll this vni is trying to fill albeit without the rep bonus it actually does need or the cap to run them.
---
Perhaps adjusting the anomalies to eat drones like sleepers would be a better and simpler solution?
---
The vni is, and always has been about drones and drone damage.  It was supposed to be exactly as strong as it is.  You want to stop the afk/bot ratting?  
---
CHANGE THE GOD DAMNED ANOMS!
---
Make drone agro an actual thing.
---
Add some element of randomness.
---
Add an assload of webbing frigates that can exceed 100mn vni speeds.
---
Nobody is bitching about the vni in pvp.  That should indicate that the ship itself is not a problem as it is.  Fix the actual problem instead.
---
Having the ability of safely storing and moving supers is among the worst things recently happening to the game. It dramatically increased mindless super capital numbers in blob fights. Keepstars should have plain never made it into the game or should have been limited to one per region.
---
RIP VNI POS bash fleets...
---
And if you take skill injectors out like a lot of people keep suggesting day 7 - 90 would be much worse as well
---
This is what you get with goons running the CSM...
---
Blizzard proved if you drip feed tiny inconsequential rewards the players may not love you but the MAUs will be up.
---
I seem to be going against the grain on this, but I don't see the issue with optional small daily missions/quests which can be done at the players' discretion. I'm open to being wrong on this but the idea of daily quests in EVE doesn't seem too bad to me.
---
Look, if you force yourself into a role you don't want, you will get burned out and you won't enjoy the game. I'd advise finding a different corp if you feel you can't do what you really want to do.
---
That being said, when it comes to combat, tackling can be pretty fun, as it's taking a usually small ship and moving really quickly to intercept and lock down an enemy in place so the rest of the fleet can do its thing and finish them off. It can be pretty exciting to be that guy. I'd suggest trying it out.
---
If you find that you don't like combat, but that's all your corp focuses on, I heavily reccomend finding a corp that suits your desires more. Lots of newbies make that mistake and burnout. This is a sandbox, do what you want! Don't let others lock you down.
---
Fly safe, and good luck
---
There's a few regions/TZ that I won't fuck with VNIs around gates anymore. I've been burned. I have a few names on a list that if you check their KB, they're like the hero VNI that comes and dunks on solo frig/kiki/cruisers.
---
The other thing is that you can safe dreads in a C5/6 without having to use a fort. There's implications in WHs to this.
---
The POS mechanics being removed/changed really affects us the most. Bringing a POS to evict a WH or dropping one as a cheaper alternative to a fortizar.
---
what if this is not a dread.... what if it is a ship bigger than the world ark?
---
Thinking inside a box won’t “solve” the actual problem, player retention states could be going down or up but if overall eve player based is on a he decline CCP has to do something about it. Whether it involves adding some sort of gladiator mode or creating a contained training ground with small roaming fleets and access to basic skill. With this you could incentivize new/old FC’s to come to these locations and show new players how awesome the game is and talk about their experiences. 
---
Anything but the boring ass missions I had to start out with would have been much more fun an attractive to a new player. My case was fairly unique since I’d played one of the games DUST 514 (dead FPS) and experiences and heard about some of the aspects of the Eve universe. And am fairly good at finding and knowing which groups I want to be playing with.
---
I have been dreaming of this as well... a BLOPS ship would be so much fun
---
Suitonia is not a lobbyist, as far as i understand he provided feedback/suggestions when CCP needed them, and did not push his own agenda hard.
---
found the independet voter!
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pti8ug/csm-14-has-been-elected
---
&gt;There is an important call out that I would like to make. We have identified a single vote that has been cast on a character outside of the CSM 14 ballot.
---
Yeah this is a buff in my opinion. Utility high and armor repair bonus with 6 low slots? Can't wait for the x-type solo guise to brag about how good they are with some youtube videos. I'm probably just envious of their cash on hand lmao
---
Have you been around the last time they tried this?
---
People who couldnt simply warp to a gate or belt to find some npcs to kill (i.e. wh residents), were pretty mad about it.
---
In eve there is this notion that makes optional stuff mandatory to get...same goes for login rewards, sp/h in training (aparently if someone gets constant perfect remap training with +5s, that has to be the norm for everyone) - things in eve are rarely perceived as optional if they concern sp.
---
So why haven't they used them in the first place? hah
---
This isn't the first year a non-ballot candidate received a vote
---
Fun fact: early game drone skills allowed you to boost the number of drones you could fly, so there were domis with 22 drones out at one point.
---
i love the ol' battle heron. its always such a suprise once you see it start fighting back. Purely made by the content gods.
---
"Hero tackle" stories make very good memories.
---
This time I was with brave, we make a small roam to teach newbros (I am a newbro).
---
There is a confessor 40km from the gate . Our FC says "he is a streamer, he comes here because it's fun to farm newbros". I hear "I want him NOW". We go, three tacklers, with angle as of not to get easy alphaed, in a triangle formation so he can't burn sideway. I am not locked, one of us three is, and needs to disengage as he is taking damage. I OL my MWD, request to orbit 500, start locking. 
---
My MWD is almost burnt when I reach scram range. I apply scram and web.
---
I scream in the mic "I GOT HIM ! SCRAMMED !! WARP ME" and press a ten or so X in fleet chat.
---
I start taking damage, cut the mwd, I know I will not survive, may as welll start shooting him.
---
I receive a KM… but I notice my fleet mate all warped to me and he is tackled for good.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/56199772/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56199772/)
---
After that I warp off (though my capsule was empty) and the KM drops in fleet chat.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/56199782/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56199782/)
---
I get paid 10M as of the hero tackle.  The FC tell us to look at local, as this guy is salty. Too bad my game logs stop from 2017 .
---
He forgot to use the boosh
---
Always thought it was strange that a cruiser could use heavy drones which imo should be for BB/BC.
---
When I was farming as a newbro, dominixes were an easy target for bombers. Also getting cruiser to V is faster than getting BS to V. Also required more skills, eg in cap, armor repair, while VNI requires only skills in afterburner, drones, cruiser.
---
Now I don't who this "they" is, so I can't answer such a stupidly formulated question.
---
Damn, it's a shame the Judge didn't get in. He's a good CSM member. However big congrats to everyone involved. Nice to see Brave on the board too.
---
Don't lm at work and now l have to go to the toilet to fap ....
---
Yeah it is. You run the smaller sites such as forsaken rally points and forlorn hubs as it mentions in the document.
---
That's fair, and tying SP rewards to dailies does seem a little unfair. Though by the same token it could be a benefit by giving active players a leg up over inactive ones. So there's arguments to be had there.
---
But I genuinely don't understand the aversion to dailies in general.
---
:O YOU GOT ME!
---
so first you have 2 game accounts (at max 3 characters per account)
---
That means you should have one char in each in Jita to sell SP (and trade if you want  but … meh.) Also one can be neutral alt, and one corped alt, but not sure if useful.
---
That means you have 2 more alts per account. I think EACH of them should do PI. correct P2 installation only requires logistic once every week, and needs to relaunch heads every 3 days or so.
---
Such an installation scales exactly with the number of toons you have. The sad thing is, you need to have a way to move there fast (I think inty is good) and a ship here (epithal) - also a logistic service.
---
I think you can also do P3 but I'm not sure if it's really worth more than not doing it. When I did my formula I compared the worth of P4 to the worth of P2, after BB, for the same activity, and it was definitely better but I needed like 14 planets doing P2 to feed one P4 planet. And actually P2-P4 needed more activity (because the raw consumption in m³/h is higher so I need to bring more resources but the repositories are limited)
---
Now on each Toon that is not combat-oriented, have the skills for cyno. just for convenience. Cyno V is sweet. Also inty, to be able to move fast.
---
Then if you have access to a research facility, get your research skills to V. adv industry, adv research, can't remember all but it takes circa 3 months to be able to have 9 industry jobs with maximum speed. Also use the 2 research implants (20M each), they give -3% time of research and when the research is in months it's definitely worth it.
---
Of course the 2 jita alts should also have those implants and those skills (though PI is useless on them), if they are blued in the alliance they can be contracted bpos to research (it's a pain in the but to not be able to have shared stash with alts though)
---
Don’t even need instalock, the spool up is 5 seconds even with max skill, right?
---
Yes, but short daily missions can be run on 2-3 characters with minimal issue. If it's just a single mission taking ~30 mins and awarding ~10-25k SP then that doesn't seem like too much of an issue. It only gets punishing to the players with dozens or hundreds of accounts, which are the players you want to punish with diminishing returns.      
---
Put another way, people are willing to go to the effort of running multiple accounts for the express purpose of fiddling with PI, something that will take about the same amount of effort per character as a single mission a day.
---
Official alliance ballots are some bullshit tbh
---
no.
---
Rats give ISK out of no where; CONCORD (NPCs) send cash directly to the player's wallets, thus "generating" ISK out of thin air, increasing the total amount of ISK in EVE online. Blue loot from sleepers does this too.
---
Roids on the other hand, if no-one will buy them or their materials, are entirely worthless - their value comes solely from what others will pay (usually for use in manufacturing).  Thus they do not actually insert any money into the economy - they merely facilitate the exchange of already existing currency.
---
However, since every market deal outside of immediate sell orders (AFAIK) involves taxes, it actually *removes* ISK from circulation since those taxes return to CONCORD or the market brokers or whatever.
---
This is the same for industry. Player A took X materials and made Y product, but if noone will buy the product, Player A is out both the time it took and the materials it took.
---
that's an important and agreeable caveat.
---
30 Minutes on multiple characters every day to get the sp. That is the whole playsession for most players..if you have one or two hours for the game every day, do you really want to spend that on "mandatory" content to "catch up" or "not Fall behind" on sp?
---
We have told new players for years that implants are important, that a full skillq is important...what kind of image of the game does that give to a new player? Just do your daily 30 minute mission and feel bad for every day you missed
---
&gt; Why do you even care how many Accounts someone has as long as they stick to the rules
---
Because that guy who you think was solo has 3-4 backup characters and i'm by myself for real.
---
But afaik i've experienced this directly. I've got a dozen alts in wow right, i liked being  able to hit the blingtron 5000 daily quest because it could drop mounts right? People with 150+ alts complaining endlessly ruined it for me they made it so that its once per day per account. 
---
For me this kind of thing would be a significant positive for my main and alpha alt account. And people who compulsively run dozens of characters shouldn't be allowed to ruin things for those of us who don't sperg so hard.
---
just here to continue collecting salty goon tears
---
WH rep disagree ?
---
15,000 bans over years, with 10,000 new accounts being made every month. That's not even a drop in the bucket.
---
&gt;no.
---
yes, that's what you are saying when you say I am wrong . I \*literally\* said that ore needs more works to be get \*actual\*  ISK. 
---
Please stop systematic answers and read what I wrote.
---
triglavian mining barge please with 8 entropic strip miners to mine whole belt in minute
---
didn't he get the memo that bluetral doesn't mean blue?
---
I fly garmurs with a 45km point and a 5km/s speed and i die all the time. You fly the wrong kind of ships. If you want to solo pvp you pretty much have to fly a ship that has the ability to disengage at will (aka kiters). Otherwise you will get ganged up.
---
make mining praxises  in there now please
---
Just wow...thats a different level of envy...
---
You are aware that people who have that many accounts would not be the ones to really complain? They have those chars for completely different reasons.
---
I run 8 Accounts for production and i sure as hell wouldnt care about it.
---
This.. I remember flying fitted 20-25 million isk BC's.. Fitted frigs were maybe 2-3 million.. Last time I played a BC was in the 70 million isk range fitted.
---
And a nergal won’t?

I once had a severe  nap attack running a combat site in a gila, when I woke up five minutes later all the rats were dead.

---
Rolling C1 Wh’s
---
You lost a fight...to a bot?  
---
Are you ok, chief?
---
Cruisers can hit an AB frigate unless the cruiser is arty fit or something. But any decent fit pvp cruiser will either have web or neuts, and webbed up you can’t speed tank, and neuted out you can’t speed tank or shoot. 
---
Anything bigger than a cruiser might have trouble hitting, but again, scram/web/neuts will be enough to fix that real quick
---
I was never a null sec guy was always in low.. When you guys say super ratting you mean they are running anoms right?
---
Eve is dead what game lul
---
Well time to buy some potatoes. I will armor tank them and cyno up when i get tackled. That will be fun for the umbrella.
---
Should have made the first one function so we'd be interested.
---
Surviving at least... Call me an optimist :P
---
He doesn't need proof hes the fucking mittani he knows this this game works!
---
What about daily PvP rewards then? But I guess that could be taken advantage of with alts.
---
Unless it's based on isk destroyed. And as long as the goal is more isk than the reward, then maybe it can work?
---
5.5m so meaning you need more than an alpha after extracting to extract.
---
Its not as formulaic as isk/hr. Vni ratting is easy, moderate money, not to mention no fighting allied explorer bots who cherry pick cans. Older players can do it in ishtars and rattlesnakes, bots can do it in whatever they want because they can replace losses easily when their programs fail. This only really sucks for the newer players.
---
I have cancer now  
---
This is why you should never browse r/eve from newest first guys
---
WH man likey
---
Carry one of:
---
- mobile mjd unit
---
- depot + stabs
---
- depot + rail fit (these really do fuck garmur up) 
---
- depot + some overprop fit (preferably 10mn as his 20km scram will stop it)
---
Sure &gt;I&lt; can, but the kind of player who is still training into t1 battleship doctrines and getting his feet under him can't afford the skillpoints OR isk.
---
People a lot smarter and more in-tune with the meta have realized that no, it's not that good.  
---
Thank you, try again later.
---
Yup..that is the issue. I am not saying that there can never be a decent implementation of such rewards..but this is eve afterall so you really need to be careful how you design it as people will abuse them if possible
---
I think that's Dunk
---
I'm hating my own idea. but for new blood it might be necessary. CCP should make pre build T1 ships and give them to the player for level 1 and 2 missions or add a recommended missile/gun fit to those low tier missions. So the player knows what he needs to look for. Like min 20 dps maybe show a prebuild they can buy in that station. They did it for skills why not for stations with missions in them.    
---
Also they should also make a brawl instance where they can brawl  1v1, 3v3 and everyone gets the same free ship and make it rotate. So people can get a feel for a ship and can see how other people do it without putting their isk on the line . And if they like it they got some fits they can buy and more importantly get a feel for what might be missing in those prebuilds so people want to invest the time to learn the fitting system. That NPE is better than what we had but it doesn't explain why something is what it is. Like check the ship hull for bonuses. I had to tell cute noobies to look at that to get an idea on what weapons platform their ship was based.  
---
This is all to get the player hooked so they want to learn. atm eve is just a giant rtfm game and sadly the current generation of gamers is used to instantly get what they want. And CCP is still a company so they need money to keep the lights on and give us free expansions
---
Please no. I hate the fighter controls. That's why i still rat in vnis and not in a carrier or super.
---
As someone who admires the ships of Eve Online, I admire this creation.
---
He’s not wrong
---
If they were serious about solving the problem of bots while not having the manpower to go after it all the time, they would outsource it to the players by delaying local chat so that hunters could actually find and land on the targets before they warp off. Even a minute of delay is huge. Instead with this change bots are just going to side-grade to a dominix and they can still warp off before hostiles land on them. Heck, the better botting programs will probably just add a functionality so that the bots fire the VNI's guns. This solves nothing.
---
True. If they remove drone auto agression i go from afk ratter to botter. But only the 4 or 8 sites i usually do. No need to let the bot run 24/7
---
Ever set your PI to use 24 hour cycles?
---
Try it, and see what you think.
---
Congratulations. I hope that seeing how the sausage is made doesn't disillusion you too much.
---
That's actually what I do normally, and it works fine for me. I spend maybe 30mins a day checking up on all my alts' PI and then go about my business.
---
I love heavy neut/medium neut structure tank domi for constellation defense.
---
I say constellation bc fitting it like that doesnt allow for many precious 3200s.
---
Just to clarify here, are you concerned about *actual* AFK ratting or "AFK" (wink wink) ratting?
---
Wonderfull !
---
Yes, but that primarily negatively impacts players with multiple accounts and provides much-needed diminishing returns for these accounts. This is not going to negatively impact a new player with 1-3 accounts, for whom this serves as a fun way to get some bonus SP every day in exchange for 30-90mins of missioning.
---
There should be an attribute that tells you how many units of ore are needed in order to refine it, in the show info tab of the ore.
---
So the drama is coming to CSM
---
ok i'll bite. Could you please share with us the unenlightened what's the biggest problem nullsec and the game in general are facing?
---
There was a VNI problem before Alphas.
---
I guess you mean alphas as in alts of vets
---
plex :D
---
Considering SP trains in real time, your subscription is literally just buying sp. Even more so now that it is a tradeable commodity. 
---
And so lets you do stuff, so anything that gives you so is almost definitely mandatory.
---
My version of that was to have a starting system or handful of them, death has no consequences, everyone is new, you can fight, practise, do the tutorials and after X amount of time you get moved to real EVE.
---
Nothing carries across or out, no ISK, no ships, no kill mails.
---
I tried this game 3 times before i stayed. First time in 2011. Only login once on the first day for a couple of hours. Second time at the start of 2014. Mined with a venture for a week in highsec. Third time at the end of 2014. I started with a trial account again and joined a player corp for the first time. They flew lvl 4 missions every 2 weeks and every other week they mined with boost and hauling. I wanted to participate and had a goal to work towards. Supscribed the next day for a year. The game alone did not make me stay.
---
Didn't realize slot position mattered.  Think I put most the wh, small gang pvpers on my ballot.  Glad a whaler got on the board.  Good luck.  And don't let them make anything Safer in highsec either.
---
What they should do is for pride month give us a crystal that shoots all the laser ammo types at random so you can have amarr ships shooting lasers.
---
Everxthing can fit a cyno. The question is does a shield speed tank vni sirvive long enough for something to jump to you.
---
You are still turning the game into mandatory missionrunning for new players especially. 30 Minutes might be all that people can spend on the game per day...and even if they can spend more, you are forcing people into doing Missions if they find those fun or not, if they want the sp. That is so fundamentaly against the core ideas of eve...
---
To refine any ore like Jaspet you need 100 units or 1 unit of compressed ore (which is 100 units squished down in mass).  The yield shown on show details is what you would get from 100% yield of 100 units.  No one has 100% yield.  Your reprocessing rate is shown in the reprocessing window.  It depends on your skills per ore and what kind of structure you are using and how it is rigged.
---
I mean it is still pretty strong if you are blobbing someone and there is no way for them to get the ECM boat
---
Won't they then just be put off by the next 'necessary' skills (like T2 guns or Drones V or whatever)? You already get quite a good amount of free skills compared to the old days.
---
i'm saying there is a fundamental difference between the two in that one literally generates isk while the other just moves it. Both have the net result of increasing isk in the player's wallet but in very different ways. 
---
That is the REAL difference between the two. The fact that you need to refine them and that's another step just goes into the isk/hour calculation, it's part of mining.
---
I don't see the problem. It's been like this from day one. Eve is basically a Darwinian experiment masqurading as a video game.
---
Ccp has made many player supported changes that was supposed to bring in loads of new players but didn't.
---
 They never will, eve players and sci fi fans don't like to understand this but space ship games never generate huge followings.  Add some orks and shit and the flood gates would open.
---
Funny enough, I'm a battletech fan and I see the same thing. People find out how small the fan base is and have all these ideas that are aimed at broadening the appeal. The various owners of battletech tried all that, giant robotic tanks are like space ships, cool and all but not something that will ever have a huge fandom.
---
they will, definitely, but there are some skills that are so core and generic that they're like potty training - fittings, capacitor, maneuvering. The rest are "bonuses" - new guns, new ships. I'm not entirely against letting players grind into most T1 ships and maybe even frig and cruiser sized T2 weapons but that might be too much.
---
Because i want to enjoy it casually in spite of those who want to hardcore sperg over it?
---
I kinda disagreed with you at first, but then I remember how you start the tutorial being talked to by your commander and aura for awhile, they took you out and show you the fleet etc. And then you finish that part, and the rest of the game is eve sounds and clicking, immediately detached.. Yeah they should add more voice acting.
---
If your accounts are linked to the same email address then they will probably count you as being one player
---
The poor thing was barebones probe/data/relic fit, it died really fast then the Strat and Legion uncloaked.
---
I really messed up launching my drones, I was on the hole so I wanted to drop sentries, but I kept launching light drones, the damage really picked up so I splashed the hole to hi-sec.
---
I try to convo the exploration pilots in Asteros and T1s and answer their questions of how and why they died, link some WH tips and a few mill ISK.
---
Yeah right, they should also start scripting like chori lmao
---
As a WH resident I (And many of my corpmates) had no issue with finding and killing an NPC when they originally trialed it. I don't get why so many people were upset about it. 🤷‍♀️

---
I had a simular reaction to the VNI thread here,  the OP isnt interested about fixing botting,  he just thinks his playstyle is the best,  so we should all be actively playing all the fucking time..  next thing we cant install industry jobs anymore.
---
What he fails to understand is that by this afk ratting style he is effectively killing his own pool of fish.   Meaning Tuskers,  would love to snatch vni kills,  and many times over they are successfull,   but the moment everyone has to actively click..  We will be in warp, before these guys land.   Killing their own playstyle.

---
Huge fucking thanks for posting this! It's cool to see quickly whats up .
---
Why rat in a sub in 0.0?
---
Noone is preventing you from playing the game casually just because they play it with more accounts
---
What is wrong with the overlay system? :O
---
It sorts by range ?!
---
How so?
---
Is it a problem to make fights under the supercap umbrella?
---
Mining you have to warp to the structure and drop your ore every so often. Ratting you have to warp between havens. Not sure how fast cargo fills up on miners, and it obviously depends which one you’re using, but it’s not that different
---
There is a problem with people dropping caps/blops on small gang/solo.
---
If no one will sell stuff for isk, then isk is also worthless. We could just go to a barter only economy, just using trade contracts. Would be interesting, to say the least
---
Default overview NEEDS to be changed. Would benefit from CCP working with players on this, and the popular overview packs to create a new "default" overview that helped keep things clearer. Still remember doing small PVP stuff at fanfest and just hating the default overview.
---
Good shit 👌
---
I actually said this earlier. 
---
Also, great reference there!
---
Just saying someone has to make stuff, and it can be weeks to build, move, put on market, sell, and get ROI.
---
It’s a bit of a delayed gratification thing, but, someone needs to mine, manage PI, get NPC loot, grind missions for BPCs, ect.
---
A lot of people have to do a lot of stuff so you can use multibuy from the fitting window at Jita, don’t think of everything as isk/hr.
---
Domis can fit heavy neuts and MJD. They’re easier to catch but much harder to kill. 
---
On the other hand, this makes the roaming Lokis with 20km webs a lot less useful, which is nice, those are too powerful right now.
---
They could've done that before they nerfed it the previous go round.
---
&gt; That is the REAL difference between the two. The fact that you need to refine them and that's another step just goes into the isk/hour calculation, it's part of mining.
---
what is "REAL" difference ? If there are two differences why one of them is not real ?
---
I did not talk about refine. I was talking about isk generation, and said that you need another step to transform the ore into ISK - that is, trade with other players, NOT refine.
---
I voted for him with 2 accounts.
---
Lol, glad he won though

VNI typically is very tight on fitting and can’t work in a cyno without severely gimping the fit. A myrm or domi can
---
Dude, I neither like you, or can stand your posting. At all. You're arrogant and feel the need to reply to simple questions with a book of text to show that you're smarter than everyone else. 
---
That said, I did vote for you because if we TL;DR your walls of text, they make sense to me, and are usually accurate (aside from everything being a Goon conspiracy against you) and I know many Shoot First guys voted for you as well.
---
You don't get it. 
---
You CAN'T build from minerals only.
---
ISK generation and mineral generation are both needed to make ships. If your argument relies on the fact that one is needed, the other is not, then you are actually wrong.
---
Yes
---
Would be okay for me to remove the afk ratting *runs out of r/eve screaming // redditors with pitchforks chasing me are seen in the background*
---
And your CSM by an NDA!
---
There is. In the top header of the industry window it says how many.
---
&gt;EvE´s PvE is fun only if it is challenging and unpredictable.
---
No. Eve isn't WoW. 
---
I have fun doing repetitive sites semi-AFK in a VNI because I'm on ts/discord chatting to corp members and doing actual IRL work on my second screen.
---
The fact that this is possible is part of the allure of Eve for me and many others. Very few other games are IRL-compatible in this way.
---
This is a great idea! Someone links Dopa pls.
---
I know most people inject straight to capitals but (outside of delve) there are in fact still people who need to make money and cannot yet fly a carrier...
---
Tbh, tapi just needs a C4 with C3/C5 statics for you guys to go rat in. Easier to protect the subs and better money
---
Ur elite sweetie
---
Says the dude who sends most of his time investigating every little bit of EVE. Damn dude, you must see some shit
---
Please. This is reddit. No one here actually plays EVE, that would take precious time away from posting.
---
But why
---
That's fair, and I can agree that giving out SP for dailies might not be the best way to do things. But I don't see why giving a bit of ISK or some LP would be a bad option.
---
He killed the awesome war between CO2 and Test! Fuck that guy for killing content!
---
I wish there were printed models for sale. Sisters line especially.
---
The numbers given are the base yield for 100 units of ore (or 1 unit of Compressed ore). This yield is then modified by things such as structure type and rigs, capsuleer skill, etc.
---
If you're new enough to be asking this question, my advice is to sell your ore on the market, as you're going to get more from the raw ore than you would from the refined products.
---
As i said in another location...i am not saying that there is no good way to ever introduce such content...just that within eve it is difficult to balance something like this. Make it worthwile, but not too much so that it turns mandatory and prevent players from gaming the system.
---
All the better! It gives the ratter a chance to fight back, so long as he isn't truly afk. I'm all for giving people toolsto fight back.
---
That's what I've been doing so far, and learning the market as a whole, but I figured there's a chance something might be more expensive after refined.
---
ITT: Null bloc 1083 insults null blocks 1037 and nobody can figure out which narrative they should be spinning
---
I can get behind that.
---
So I assume we agree that dailies as a concept are not *inherently* bad, that there is a good way to do them within the context of EVE, and that maybe SP is not the best reward for them?
---
&gt; once a new meta emerges
---
Thanatos.
---
#noPoors
---
You can add to this whole NC and tose 30 PL guys that still play.
---
I just vomited. Did you just seriously say you were the WH CSM?
---
Unless you've trained your base refining skills to V and your ore-specific mining skills to at least III, the answer is usually going to be "no". Remember that the price is set by people with perfect skills and max-level implants.
---
This isn't meant to discourage you from training refining skills, having a refining alt is a very nice convenience and a decent ISK-maker if you know how, but just as a warning that if you jump into the market intending to buy a bunch of ore and refine it you may be disappointed with your results.
---
WTB physical copy of EVE.

---
congrats dude,  i don't understand enough about eve, but to me it looks like everything you're saying is 200IQ
---
Why not nerf the anomalies somehow instead? I will miss my 5 sentry VNI for high-sec exploration :'( They just keep nerfing ships, that are abused for one thing, killing it for other things in the process.
---
I'm looking for more. :D
---
This here is the reality. I too have only one account, and now loosing my decent giaranteed income. Shame that ive invested so much time/skillpoints only to see the finish line being moved further away from me.
---
The old (prior to the last buff it got) VNI was actually reasonable; had 100mbit and 5 (bonused iirc) turrets.  Now it's outright shittier than a T1 Vexor.
---
Did you just call We Form V0lta a null bloc? xD
---
That's not my point and fuck you for downvoting me for engaging with you.
---
My point is that systems never get implemented or get removed because turbo spergs with dozens of accounts meaning i can't have them.
---
You don't need a cheat sheet for jams, you just colour match your jam with the background of the ship portrait that you're targeting
---
Why should EVE be safe in the first place?
---
If newbies are being forced to do certain things or get certain skills they are in the wrong place
---
Why would you use a myrm over an Ishtar? The ticks would be way less right?
---
Within the 10% that stick around, how many are alt accounts... That makes tbis figure even worse....
---
Well it seems you guys do like 90% of your stuff in bulk so it’s easy to assume
---
Well the soe epic arc is the first thing to revamp.
---
As a new player, when an agent ask me to go on a 23j trip, for sure I quit.
---
They need to allow players to start the soe epic arc in their home constellation.
---
After that they should include a new low level faction epic arc equiparable to a l3s mission.
---
...
---
Rework Drones, ffs. We have the technology to control fighters, why not do the same for drones.
---
Ishtar. You only need HAC 1 for heavy drones.
---
Dude. I haven't played in a few years now, but this campaign video and associated story at least brought me back to /r/EVE for now. Wish I had a vote to give you, but I'm glad you didn't need it. Honestly, you deserve a fucking victory lap around the systems full of maddies, baddies, and the inner circlejerk hives belonging to TEST and GS. 
---
Also, to remain humble about it all is exceedingly rare. Especially so in a toxic environment like this funeral parlor sub. If I were you I'd be a huge immature cunt about it and relish in how many fucking souls I took during my revenge campaign.
---
That's the old NPE. New one is the same old boring clicking.
---
Well done!
---
Long Story Short [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5fzot8/fatal_market_misclick_for_50_mil_cambion/) happened. I don't play the game at the moment, i just meme around and lurk on reddit and my alliances discord for when they start playing stellaris again.
---
Rip the glorious sandbox dream... We're going to Disneyland boys and girls...
---
He killed an entire war of content, a lot of people who don't sit in Jabberlon 5 think that was a crying shame.
---
To slingshot yourself out of disruptor range you must manually pilot your ship into the path of their orbit forcing the ship enemy ship to readjust. You then head in the direction that is opposite their velocity vector so that they have the greatest momentum change to overcome to catch up to you.
---
https://ibb.co/PhMm4NV
---
I am not the one downvoting you. Not my style, sorry that someone is doing that, but it sure as hell isnt me
---
It's the most sensible new afk ship.
---
Low SP requirements, very strong. Unlike a Dominix, where you'll need Heavy Drones (again), plus the much higher multiplier BS skill.
---
Use 2, spidertank them, lows &amp; mids max gank.
---
Safespot in system and cloak?
---
Please keep your hands and feet inside the cart at all times.
---
great work man, can i haz?
---
No actually new players are using injections
---
What happened?
---
Oh!  I'm glad to see you do that!  
---
I thought i was one of the few, i always reimburse newbros after I force SD them.  Then it leads into the game of 100Q. I don't mind it, best way to learn is to die.
---
Doesn't include alts.
---
It will always be PI for me
---
And what is the problem with afk ratting?
---
Gotta stop sucking up to the noob trash and focus on retaining players who are leaving en masse imo
---
How do you plan on enforcing banning a group of players voting in an organised fashion for the candidate(s) of their choice?
---
Which is why Vily was elected.
---
Yeah, I was like "this looks better"
---
Good thing it is a room full of Goons, then.
---
Thats why i switch to a domi. Now i need someone to tackle me.
---
Would have loved to see a video about it. :D
---
PVP rewards would be dank, but this also pretty cool
---
I wish the EVE store sold anything half this cool
---
Thanks for the advice, I'll stick to raw ore then
---
There is a CSM discord:  [https://discordapp.com/invite/28pUwuc](https://discordapp.com/invite/28pUwuc)
---
Iirc it's because all of the shit has to be written to their servers' database and then pushed back to your client - they don't do any of the credits, gold, xp, battlecount, etc. stats client-side to prevent foul play due to the ease with which the client is moddable
---
Cyno alt, pi alt, research alt, production alt, skill farm alt. You can even combine these.
---
No more bookmark cleaning days?
---
goons would not want the vni to be nerfed
---
Be Brave :)
---
So its short dragon now?
---
The good thing about not being on killmails is they don't have any way to check whether you are logi, logi because you have to, pro logi or the logi logi look up to.
---
Known few who tried EVE who thought it was space-sim. They thought they would pilot the space ship with joystick....
---
Rats shouldn't instantly all switch to the capsuleer warping in to help them...
---
Congrats
---
But also blops are dropped on ratting ships very often as well.
---
Do more of what you find fun.
---
One of the great discoveries of Brave was that Hero Tackle is hard and needs a lot of player skill, and if you want to throw a bunch of willing-but-bad-for-now noobs at the enemy they are better off in ewar.
---
Therefore, I'd suggest flying a Griffin ecm frigate. The basic way to fly it is 'stay 50km away, and warp off if yellowboxed. If not yellowboxed, target the most expensive enemy and jam them'.
---
If you don't know who the most expensive enemy is, lock the ship types you can't recognise. They are probably expensive.
---
If you find this fun, do more of it.
---
If you dont, then take the tackle ship, learn how to 'spiral in' (if you dont spiral in, you die, and that's no fun) and then tackle them.
---
If you have ever enjoyed playing a healer in any other MMO, then skip all this and ask your leadership 'Do we run armor or shield ?', and then train appropriately for logi.
---
RIP anyone who trained a Gallente alpha as an actual character.  Can't use one of their main T2 medium weapon systems, weewoo.
---
I dont know where the vni fitting is tight.
---
 100mn. Drone nav. Omni. LSE
---
4 DDA 2 tracking Enhancer 
---
Easy space for a cyno. But lighting it is where the problems start.
---
This is top class CCP.  Hilmar probably thinks its the most brilliant idea since sliced bread.
---
Why tho?
---
A long time ago in the North, me and a FC were doing target painter experiments against what BL were using at the time.
---
A single painting frig increased fleet damage by fourteen percent.
---
Just something to think about.
---
I have "Gemini" release on CD. Its the 0.9 version that went gold.
---
As subcaps go, an all-gank Vindicator is still the king of guristas/serpentis ratting, IMO, and there's an argument to be made for the polarized Nightmare (with 2 imp navy smartbombs) in EM/TH space. The rattle is a great ship, but folks look at the flat DPS figure and fail to take in account application and missile/drone travel time.
---
does the market transactions tab in your character's wallet only go back a certain amount of time?  If so, is there a way to check your market history for longer than what the wallet shows?  I'm trying to verify a few items for all the inventory i've ever bought of certain items, but some of my math doesn't seem to be adding up with the tools ingame.
---
Bingo. Afk ratters can be killed. Botting vni's can't. That's the biggest difference. Even if a person is afk ratting on 10 accounts, you can kill all the ships before the person notices. Bots will just dock up and wait.
---
You were on FRT's ballot too ^^ (it was basically edited panfam ballot)
---
People already bot in Ravens and other such ships. The point is that they're still substantially easier to catch.
---
All images, concepts, and names are property of CPP Games. inb4 u get sued by CCP for incorrectly typing their name...
---
yeah
---
nein
---
Already memed a couple of weeks ago
---
The ONI is different because it is a weaker bonus that only applies to different ammo than the main bonus; you can't get more than 2 effective bonuses at once.
---
video link? + timestamp if possible
---
Congrats, dude. For the love of god, do not fuck it up.
---
ok.
---
You were on FRT's ballot too (edited panfams ballot)
---
l just hope you don't start down the path of nerfing rorqs now you am in
---
Great way to make legit players leave, why haven't CCP thought of it before!
---
There are belt sites, just not the regular ones, all of them need to be scanned.
---
how big of a nerf is it really? you cant afk speed tank with heavies anymore but you get more turret damage and i assume that adding turrets will cancel out the damage loss of using mediums instead of heavies. 
---
you just cant afk anymore
---
\^this \^
---
m³ is usefull because that's what your mining yield is in.
---
Bloody newbro cost a fortune especialky when your drunk and add a few to many zeros...
---
Wow, touche. As i can see goons have 3 of the 10 seats only. You also must not know much or anything about goons at all if you mistake them for kids, which would be your insinuation.
---
The main content is pvp. The game must be balanced for that.
---
What a dull life. Just habitation? Dont forget bowling, theaters, schools, hospitals, bars, restaurants. People need more than a home for comfort.
---
I have no frands. I afk rat to feed my skill injector addiction.
---
it does matter to some people though, some people's issues are important to some people. i think at least they should've at least rejigged that ship's stats by now as things stand its entirely useless.
---
Congrats on being able to do nothing!
---
Garmur is trash n troll ship. Stop flying 8kmh projection fits and step up your gameplay.
---
Lmfao Stitch lost
---
Been playing 12 years, congrats, this is the most retarded and unfeasible mechanic i have ever heard. Kudos
---
Mostly I got them for free.  I think I only bought the original copy and the Collectors Edition.  The rest were gifts or freebies from various places.
---
I like collecting things.  I have a whole box of EVE stuff under my bed.
---
pressing f for my afk vni alpha. now i dont feel bad about only remembering to log in like once a month to train
---

---
You're missing the point.
---
In sales, your opportunity to make a pitch usually ends when a person walks out the door. Once they're gone, they're gone, and your ability to influence them has ended, maybe, if you're lucky, they took a brochure of some kind, but that's about it.
---
Your attitude is one of "good riddance" which is entirely the wrong attitude to take.  The emphasis should be on keeping them in for as long as possible, because every additional hour they're in the platform, is an hour they're being exposed to at least *some* of the game, and that means you have an opportunity to encourage them to try more parts of it.
---
When a person is learning to play poker, or play a sport, they don't immediately start playing for large amounts of cash, or join the national team. They use substitutes instead, worthless tokens, or join a low level team and play friendly matches where the consequences of failure are not that high.
---
Over time, they may become better, want to challenge themselves more, maybe play a pro game, or join a higher tier team.
---
But that's never going to happen if they quit after the first game because they used up their resources.
---
Yes, so nerfing cynos would hurt the pvp, and make ratting safer.
---
Yeah, kids would imply they aren't sub-human, so good point.
---
&gt;"Non-risk adverse" people are only that way because their titan is srped and they have backup.
---
This would be a risk averse person, as there is no risk in your use-case. I'm fairly certain most alliances don't SRP hyperspatial ragnaroks caught bridging in hostile space. Additionally once the bridge is up you are 100% vulnerable for its duration, and "in enemy space" implies outside of your own umbrella and inside the enemy's, good luck with your "backup"
---
this will make the keres much more power than it is
---
Im not opposed to fixing the GNI. It could probably be done in less than 10 minutes, but this is CCP we are talking about.
---
You should check Makoto Priano presentation about all Triglavian so far, it starts around 05:08 and it lasts for 20 minutes
---
[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/442644023?filter=archives&amp;sort=time)
---
We don't fully understand their motives for doing so. But i'd imagine it has something to do with capsuleers going into abyssal deadspace and stealing their shit. Or maybe not and they left that shit there for us to take *cue x files theme*
---
Drones, as a weapon system, should have never been in the game.
---
 - They make no logical sense as a concept(submarines don't launch smaller submarines to attack ships)
---
 - They have no fitting requirements, use no cap, use no ammo
---
 - They pretty much completely ignore EWAR
---
 - They are the only weapon system that has all three sizes simultaneously - a large turret fit Battleship will have trouble hitting smaller ships, but droneboats can simply launch smaller drones and remain just as effective
---
 - Sentry drones lmao
---
 - Auto-aggro and assigning drones are beyond broken
---
 - They have unknown, but likely *gigantic* impact on game performance, since they basically multiply the amount of "ships" in any battle by 3-5
---
If Aryth knew shit, he would have told the rest of goon highcommand not to go into drone regions and cause havoc since that chaos contributed to excavator drones being 1bil/unit for a long time which in turn made Olmeca rich by using hard working goon citizens as fuel
---
I don't think they'll remove him.  I think he'll just be a constant distraction and work to discredit the CSM as a whole.
---
Why is picture of text
---
But why?? Why only w-space doesn't have belt?? Wormhole ores are same as null sec ores. wtf ccp
---
They invade because they can
---
Printing that Modell with a resin printer would be great.
---
Imagine if Eve had the Modells with the guns/lasers that you could buy like Warhammer 40k Modells!
---
Just Turn your fitting in to a modell!
---
besides isn't wormhole space more dangerous than null since it doesn't show up locals?
---
I hope that at least by the end of his CSM term Olmeca will be cured from his *goon-centrism*. Man is too obsessed by goons.
---
they only attack the nearest ship. as the closest ship changes the previous damaged ship can repair and the new fresh ship takes hits
---
also auto targeting missiles do really low damage and dont have great range.
---
&gt;Undock while at War?
---
This is going to save soooooo many newbs
---
can alphas fly an ishtar?
---
whats wrong with afk ratting? What we really need is smarter drones, who would focus on small ships first, also not fail to focus fire, also not fail to actually atrart attacking
---
You were more fun when you weren't a blatant goon mouthpiece.
---
Could anyone link where does this screenshot come from? I could find it in the upcoming changes or news thread.
---
Skills that everyone must have, that new players can easily get, and which cannot be extracted...
---
...sounds like "remove magic 14" to me
---
Domis are actually quite a lot harder for a solo hunter to kill, as not only are they a decent chunk tankier (so they can fit cyno and realistically be saved), but also can fit MJD so the standard Lokis, Strats, etc will be putting themselves at significant risk.
---
U R THE 1%
---
Has he committed too much to the troll life or...
---
It has no real bearing on hunting ratters as you could just get counter cynoed. This is what the umbrella is for, is it not?
---
Having a 5 minute delay would make it safer for you to go for that ratter.
---
arbitrary CCP decision
---
Highsec was always this way
---
If you call "doing stupid shit" "consent"
---
It seems to me like wormholes are safer if you careful enough, as you can warp to the hole and out the system the moment you detect any scan probs, so people would only get a vague readings from the first few scans.
---
&gt; Eve is basically a Darwinian experiment masqurading as a video game.
---
DAE EVERYONE VERSUS EVERYONE??/1/1/11
---
Maybe
---
They should also make autopilot go to 0.  The pros of this change greatly outweigh the cons.
---
It probably doesn't even make ganks more difficult overall.  Sure, you don't get that 10km drift, but the use of autopilot by all players would skyrocket, creating other opportunities.
---
You also massively disgruntle your existing consumer base if you change the product into something they don't like. Which is a bad tradeoff if you can't gurantee that there will be more people coming than leaving because of it. Which CCP can't. 
---
The fact of the matter is that EVE is not a game for everyone. Which is percisely what it's players like about it. Someone who would not otherwise play EVE won't suddenly start because of a fancy deathmatch arena. Loss and it's permanancy are *the* centerpiece of EVE, and it's not possible to retain a player that can't cope with that fact. EVE's new player retention counts have always been abysmal because of this. Now add to that the fact that the emergent gameplay EVE is infamous for, is on it's way out due to rorq and capital spam aswell as shitty citadel and sov mechanics, and you have a recepie for disaster. Which is exactly what is currently happening. And as long as these problems are not fixed, the playercounts, of both old and new, will dwindle. No sales pitch or newbi accomodation can save EVE from burned out players due to shitty mechanics.
---
So it's a standard Vexor now?
---
fact that 3 of them are from same alliance just shows that the system doesn't work, you could put a limit on it 1 per alliance but goons would find a way round it no doubt. Good to see Olmeca got in think comments appealed to most people on view of game and at least plays and has some up to dat knowledge of the game. I just hope this CSM can bring more changes to the game working alongside CCP like last years did some good changes small steps in a right direction but not far enough in my view. Would have liked to seen somebody there from low sec group to push that aspect as it is in need of help.
---
Cos sleepers with rorqs is too scary to contemplate
---
X% of all NPC bounties are placed as player bounties on the people who have killed you in the last 5 years. equally distributed.
---
^^^^^^where ^^^^^^X ^^^^^^= ^^^^^^100
---
&gt; You also massively disgruntle your existing consumer base if you change the product into something they don't like.
---
Which just shows that those players who quit because of it are self-entitled egotists who think their views at the only ones that count. They are willing to martyr the entire game to support their cause.
---
No-one at all, anywhere, at any time, in any situation, has suggested forcing players to use battle-arena and learning environments. 
---
If they don't want to use it, don't. For everyone else, they'll be getting far more content and enjoying their game time far more than the guy multiboxing 20 rorqs then F1 spamming in a fleet where no-one notices if they die.
---
&gt;CCP is just deliberately playing upon the "Russian Aggression" crap from our world?
---
what?
---
I agree, I'd rather tether be completely removed from the game.
---
I was there :)
---
Wouldn't surprise me if the former is very much the reason. All the interaction with these Extra-New-Eden areas so far amounts to capsuleers venturing in and stealing the property of something likely very ancient and very not keen on strangers taking their stuff.
---
Right, the 7 - 90 days ones are in order to get to a point you can actually fly cool stuff.
---
unknown space = unmapped belts
---
scanners discover belts from time to time
---
&gt; you just cant afk anymore
---
That’s the nerf, AFK ratting is the main use case of the VNI for about 70% of people.
---
No this will be when Aryth will make Olmeca leaq something that will get him and Gobbins banned.
---
after thinking more about this change what im seeing is that if you want to afk youre going to have to pay for omega to use an ishtar. i dont know how that will affect bots.
---
I think CCP is pretty harsh on people selling stuff; although I’m sure there is a workaround
---
Back in 2016 when the first Keepstars started dying, CCP gave us a estimate on how many people were in a Keepstar: 132 million.
---
I can't find the source anymore tho.
---
i never thought i would ask this on reddit.... can i see your box?
---
Thanks! That is pretty damn comprehensive!
---
Bit rich coming from goons latest ringpiece.
---
Lapping up the goon spin I see. Like I seem to ask this question a lot at the minute but if you were ncpl what would you do. Undock all out stuff, lose it all, watch most of their members just quit the game, realise that majority of those guys pay to play and watch Eve die because they aren't getting enough subs anymore and the entirety of null sec is now blue to each other?
---
I was in the PH Tackle Fleet and it was fun :)
---
How do they know that?
---
Because he said so at the presentation.
---
Same, then I load antimatter.
---
except that logic is nil since when 'asteroid belts' in regular space respawn that's a different belt as CCP has said decades ago
---
I really wished the SoS of eve ships came out sooner
---
blaster with antimatter and dual web (or grappler) can work pretty well ... if you manage to get to your target.
---
well  there used to be asteroid belts in wormhole space at early times had them but  they ere quickly removed
---
Than you, gonna print that o7
---
It actually has one niche use: it's the cheapest ship that can fit 7 (8 ?) festival launchers.
---
Tell that chris roberts.
---
Nothing, it's that godddamn menu that pops up every time I go to lock whoever is tackling me and move my mouse 3 microns too low, and then I have to wait for, what In PvP engagements seems like eternity, for it to fuck off.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/UqiJ7lh
---
Its mostly trinkets and bits and bobs. Fanfest memorabilia, stuff I got while working at CCP, random bits of faf (I have business cards from like 40 different alliances and websites somewhere too).
---
Not sure what math / details you're looking for. You can check the Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_system) on the Wright system, that is used for the CSM election. CCP also provides their implementation (in Python) in the zip [file](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/aws/community/CSM14Results.7z) they publish with the CSM results.
---
I think he means in the old system.
---
I too remember my first beer.
---
Damn, son. Which Disneyland did you go to where you're rewarded for slaying countless actors?
---
I assume this is a PvP related question and small targets mean "frigates"
---
Blasters will track small targets in close range given you have the enemy hard tackled (a scram and a grappler should be sufficient), even though ab frigates might still be able to mitigate the damage.
---
Rail guns will not track small targets that are close to you unless both you and them are completely stationary. 
---
In order for rail guns to start applying you need sufficient range AND to have the target hard tackled (scram web)
---
You can start attempting to hit small stuff at 50+ km, but you need to match transversal with the target. An untackled AB frigate at 50km will still mitigate most of the rail gun damage with ease. 
---
You should be looking at 80+ km range if you want to try consistently applying to small targets, and even at those ranges matching transversal is important for decent application.
---
At any rate, railguns will not track MWDing frigs at ANY range provided they have enough transversal. The target absolutely needs to be hard tackled by someone else.
---
And where is your player interaction in other mmo games? You just grind to max level there.
---
Just market is as *Brothers of Eve*
---
Could you upload the stand model and link it somewhere please. Looks really nice
---
Damn, Lootfairy said very yes on that one! Good job on a great kill!
---
&gt; Or CCP is just deliberately playing upon the "Russian Aggression" crap from our world?
---
Holy shit you are dumb.
---
Holy shit you are a spodbrain.
---
Nice collection !
---
Well, we'd have to ask Blizzard and their 3 million+ subscribers how many join guilds and go on things like raids and PVP together.
---
They just felt like fucking shit up.
---
ha-ha-ha :D
---
you need to understand how tracking works.
---
Then decide on a quantity of EHP the small frigate has, as well as distance, speed, etc. and hat gives you the probability to volley the moskito off the field.
---
Then check that probability with a tracking computer.
---
wormhole space is very safe as you can't cyno shit in.
---
What's the plan for if gank cata showed up?
---
Congrats dude. Don't fuck it up pls :)
---
Wait, are Ratting Domis a thing again?
---
Only if Wargaming tells CCP how to make a working chat.
---
i'm not sure about that, I think the trip is kind of cute. You just gotta wrap it up, maybe extend the arc so it starts in your constellation but it takes you throughout nice landmarks, like your local trade hub, or cool in space beacons, to give players a little "sight seeing" tour, to get them hooked. The best way to get a player to like eve is to show them what eve is, and how rich the universe is both in playerbase and design.
---
Combat sites don't need to be scanned down either.
---
because your argument was "one takes more time than others to get the full reward", to which I say yeah but you can just lop that into "isk per hour".
---
The *fundamental* difference between the two is where the "ISK" in the isk per hour comes from
---
Looks like a fun fight. You do still get that sort of fight occasionally
---
Tbf, we fear it so much we almost put olmeca on our vote list
---
And people often camp that hole if they see you in system, so unless you can warp to a citadel in system (or at the very least safe + cloak), people will catch you.
---
Did they forget why so many people AFK rat? I can only speak for myself but, while I haven't done any ratting in ages, I think I'd rather unsub and go play a something fun rather than feeling forces to be active during the snooze-fest that is PvE/ratting in this game..
---
the fuck?
---
 #NotOurStainGuy
---
that's a pretty valid point actually.
---
However you have to remember a lot of stuff comes from NPC sell orders (t1 bps, other stuff that are core to the economy) so it does have some inherent value. 
---
However the two are still fundamentally different, the value would need to come from somewhere, at which point whichever generation method that is (i.e value from manufacturing turning mats into equipment) will become the "money faucet".
---
Ultimately that's a good point though, i'll think about it
---
Well, if there are two holes, then you're either pursued or done for, but if there are more, I suppose, you have a chance to get away, unless there are people on your way next system.
---
A good thing, daily/weekly "quest" is more usefull for newplayer than a skill injector but if CCP can prevent those "bonus SP" being extract and sell that would be better, that way they can even double the reward for -10/20m... SP   
---
of course like long ago the bittervet will whine about that cause they can't do them with their 20accounts+ but hey it's not for you, you don't need that anyway
---
I had the original Eve box, but recently threw it away. However, I kept the manual and framed it in my office.
---
Oï !
---
The new Agency window have a part reserved for Escalations, however it’s locked behind the "Unavailable" red screen if you don’t have any Escalations up. You can still use it to track where you got an Escalation, which one it is and how far away it is from you.
---
just stop your bullshiting "fundamental" AKA "real" already. 
---
My argument was about 
---
\&gt; What’s the difference between getting isk from bounties and selling rocks for isk
---
In both cases, you get isks. Nobody cares where it comes from. 
---
The fundamental difference, is that one is variable, and the other is not ; and one is delayed by up to 20 min, the other by the time you sell your shit.
---
AFK ratting is a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself...
---
So firstly, good luck and I hope you have fun.
---
C3s are good for small groups or solo because of the ease of running sites and the easy K space exit. 
---
When looking for a hole, given what you said, you should.
---
- find an unoccupied, whilst you could certain of evict some one, I feel like there are plenty of empty C3s out there for you.
---
- choose the static that suits you. NS will be quieter but can tend to be  pain with logistics, HS the complete opposite, you will get easy access to trade hubs and naturally you will get more day trippers.
---
- you've mentioned PI, She are great sources for PI. So check the planet's in a hole, and make sure it suits your PI ability and care factor. Don't go for a perfect PI hole, because they'll most likely be taken, but don't settled for one that doesn't suit your setup.
---
-WH effects aren't for every one. They do make PvP easier, if they support you setup (Like most Eve PvE it's usually shield-drone setups that are favoured for ratting, others certainly exist).
---
That all said, eve is much much better with friends and if you can, you will.enjoy it much more if you go in with buds or join an established WH corp.
---
Sell them for ISK
---
Thanks mate, is there a way to find holes or it's literally get out there and start scanning?
---
I do know that you silly goose. It's just hard to quickly plan optimal routes when you have 10 escalations. The previous Agency had them all visually on a map.
---
*Later:
---
"I fucked up, lost everything I saved up, guess that's it." &gt; quit
---
"PVP is fun but I'm scared of losing the hard-earned money I made with 1-2m sp in high sec" &gt; quit
---
"I'm here for PVE not PVP" &gt; mine or rat for weeks then quit*
---
To be fair, those top two lines would never have survived anyway back in ye olde times when EvE actually punished you for fucking up.
---
The third line is on CCP, gotta keep the sheep happy so the wolves have something to prey on. No sheep = no wolves.
---
I think weekly missions would be better. Perhaps a list of several and you get to choose up to 3, but only one per day.
---
Depends on how autistic you want to be.
---
If you're looking for a specific hole, I'd personally pay wingspan or eve scout.
---
If you're looking for a class of hole you could find a hole with that static and roll it until you find one you like.
---
Of you could move a scanner I to thera and just refresh eve-scout.com and and what holes exist there.
---
Or give you're looking for a c3. Grab probes, go to a quiet piece of space in the sec status you desire for your static and start scanning.
---
I'm sure all the nullsec krabs are getting ready to move in then. Most cyno usage is defensive anyways so it nerfs defense. Way fewer caps in wormholes too, so lighting a cyno would usually mean that nobody can come to your help. A lot of wormhole chains are pretty short anyways, so helping a tackled friend is usually 2-3 jumps away.
---
The safest you can do for wormhole ratting is to do it in your own hole, after collapsing all non-static wormholes, and keeping cloaky alts on the wormholes at all times (and obviously, someone watching those cloaky alts). Most people don't live in their "farmhole" though because farmholes are not the best content providers (most corps are in C2 for access to kspace and wormholes, or C5 for access to other wormhole corps. C5 are good for farming, but not as good as C6).
---
If someone has preseeded the system, or prescanned it if it's in the wormhole chain (it will have been in any competent corp), someone can come in with a cloaky tackle and there's nothing you can do to detect it.
---
Quantity over quality
---
How do you know it was a bot and not just a normal player?
---
damn you got me
---
Pretty sure it was in a video in the state of world war bee (ktherwise called the casino war.) I may take a look and post it. But yeah I remember 13million +
---
How long till it crashes this time?
---
How long is the model, mate?
---
It can´t be used when the difference in speed and agility between the two engaging ships is too big.
---
For example an AB frig can´t really escape a garmur, no matter how hard you try solely due to how much faster the garmur is.
---
But MWD frig vs MWD frig slingshotting out/in is entirely possible even if you are slower than the other guy.
---
congrats. even I voted for you, I didn’t thought you will made it.
---
But here comes happy surprise. I hope EVE changes a lot.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/wlXefdW.png](https://i.imgur.com/wlXefdW.png)  ccp finally giving me the attention I deserve
---
He assumed 60% of the space is habitation though.
---
This sounds like you were flying a garbage dualrep ab incursus. Do yourself a favour and reprocess all of them.
---
You can´t really catch a competent properly fit Garmur simply due to him being able to scram you off at 18+km, long before you scram him. Blinged Daredevils have a decent chance of catching it, but Garmurs won´t fight them.
---
But most Garmurs pilots are garbage, so you can try to pop them in, say, an MWD firetail.
---
Or if you want to shame them just use a Rifter.

remove all ISK faucets. let that version of eve run for a year or two. there is plenty of ISK already in the system. 
---
if the system ever grinds to a halt as the ISK sinks suck too much ISK out of the system, its a simple switch to turn the faucets back on.
---
I think you inspired many people (including myself) to vote for the first time. So happy your in, do your best.

I have the vague recollection that it was declared an exploit after PL or NC. did it to somebody in Stain? Loong after BoB itself had disbanded.

Why, exactly? While I am sure he means well, not only will his hate boner for GSF cloud his judgement, but his ideas are, well, not feasible, and are not very good to start with.

So, I just reinstalled for the first time in many years. Hoping to try some exploration on an alpha clone. Logged in, was in the character creation screen, then got "cluster shutdown".  Does this happen often, on a schedule, or just a weekly reset?
---
Also, I am a casual, mostly solo player...  Can I be successful in exploration with minimal ratting if I play solo?
---
Thx
---
Super unpopular opinion here but the eve pvp experience outside of the eve playerbase generally looks shitty and probably is shitty for most people.
---
Take 2 games on opposite ends of the spectrum: eve and world of war ships.
---
In eve the most correctly fit ship that can hit the opponent has a massive advantage.
---
In wows, ships of same class are still very close in capability even of you fuck up the modules. Also in wows a small destroyer can eliminate a much larger and more powerful ship, and also in wows said larger ships have a mostly broken at this time secondary weapon mechanic to keep ships off them at close range.
---
For the people who like eve's pvp and have it figured out none of this is a problem. For people looking for some reasonable entertainment in ship pvp just coming to eve it's a nightmare. The mechanics are complicated are finding an evenly matched fight is even harder.
---
I mined for a Nyx,  but at the end realised that the parts are in the wrong Sotyio. I had to ask my corpmates yo bridge a bunch of T1 freighters around,  also my ceo put in the job, cause I'm not on the list of trusted builders.   
---
Nyx Police SKIN  is mandatory.
---
oh shit here we go again
---
Hey, I remember having a conversation with you like month ago before the changes. And looks like I was correct in my predictions. Though didn't anticipate ccp to mess up the mechanics this badly. You started to throw insults after losing argument back then.
---
My suggestion, treat it like "warp-to" and "keep at range," etc. You have a small list of reasonable presets, but you also have a field where you can just type in the number of hours and set that as your personal default.
---
remove them as well then. how anyone thinks you could balance RNG lockdown mechanics so that they scale in an open world XvY scneario is fucking beyond me. that shit is for arena style play with overseeable outcomes. just another display of CCPs hilarious cluelessness when it comes to game development.

Nergal is only viable in an AF gang with Deacon/Thalia support for a fast roaming gang. It has really good resists and a decent buffet tank so it will hold up well with reps. If you can catch a big target to ramp up your guns on it is pretty good and has a niche over using other AFs. However this won’t happen until/if the price drops to a similar level to that of other assault frigs.
---
For small gang/solo it is garbage and purely for memes.
---
Ho wait CCP release the fact a shitons of people leave first week. Ask why .
---
can you stop jerking off about that one time you actually killed something that shot back like 5 years ago?

looks good, is it one piece or more assembled?

More bots will be in game to support other bots using Ishtars.
---
In hold system it was easy for a very little group to own for himself enar all R64 of LS and a majority of 0.0 without be there to exploit they.
---
Now they can't beacause they need people to mine. So little entity could have better chance to own an interesting moon.

So the situation is better than the old situation.

But harder to go for that ratter.

outside of risking ~75m on a pointless endeavor, why wouldn't you run low level rats in a dramiel?
---
sometimes it's nice to feel cute when you're looking at spreadsheets online
---
The problem is that once you've done the NPE, which is actually quite good now, and the career agents, which are ok though could use an update, you're given mining, level 1 missions and lots of invites from terrible HS corps, or nullblobs.
---
The SOE epic arc is pretty good, perhaps the NPE ought to lead directly into that. Most players are going to expect a quest system on rails for a bit longer than the NPE, and while Eve is (and should remain) a sandbox, having a longer set of missions available which have a bit of storyline about them would keep people questing for longer and allow them to get hooked.
---
The other thing is that ship fitting is quite intimidating. Although Resource Wars didn't do it very well, the idea of showing some sample fits for different purposes is good. I would suggest that every new player gets sample fits saved in their personal fittings for one or two T1 frigates, their T1 dessie and T1 combat and logistics cruiser, with notes about the principles of fitting in the description. Now, you can have a big argument about what those fits should be, but anything non-retarded would be fine.

tell you what i'd do if i was still phorde is i'd not allow easy wins by 15 harpies. exactly how i didn't allow easy wins in TKE for goons.

showing up even if just to slow an attacker down is actually more commendable than doing nothing and running.

Assembled.  Ship is 8 pieces, but stand is solid.  I printed the soe logo.

I was tanking him for about 30 minutes, sending drones out one at a time, and on the tick I send the drones out he would change orbits further out and immediately focus the drone. I tried to use that to slingshot him, but when you say autoloss...

Thanks, I'm assuming I'll understand the Undock the sooner I get into the game.

i searched my C3 with Lowsec Static  in Lowsec Regions, scanned a few systems until i found a whole that i wanted. Stayed there for a Week to see if someone has logged out hunting alts in and checked KB daily.
---
After that i started to Anchor my Citadels. Be aware that rolling holes Solo is a pain in the Ass if you get a few Holes.

But its still worth the Experience, i learned a lot in there.

This awesome, thanks

Ahh, thanks

But why when they just get blobbed every time they undock. Doesn't make it fun for them so I can completely understand why they just don't bother anymore
---
You kinda run the risk if you sit a dread outside of an Astrahus my dude. Maybe plan better. This is EVE. You're not safe.
---
No, it won't. you've got a smaller sig, better resists, an ADC that's basically 15s of immunity, better range, more speed... so no.
---
Once a day at 11am eve time or 7am eastern us. If you are in the us and observe daylight savings, downtime changes by an hour accordingly.

---
A fix would be to scale the bounty payments down the bigger the ship that you use is... Use a vni 18mil ticks. Use an ishtar, 15mil ticks. Use a carrier, 10mil ticks. Use a super, 5mil ticks...
---
This would make super botting a thing of the past imho

Before "solving" AFK ratting you should first make the case why AFK ratting is a problem in need of fixing.

Id assume that keepstars in null would only reach a fraction of that capacity due to the associated dangers. However the perimeter keepstar might have the most population seeing how it's in hisec and people will have plenty of time to evacuate
---
I'm sure that if you removed the magic 14, a magic 9 or something would replace them. Just like how learning skills uses to be first-trains to "do things right" and then after their removal other stuff was. Etc.
---
C3-HS is literal Cancer to roll if you get a shit static, 5bil mass with only Battleships sucks, especially for a solo player.
---
i use an Azbel because i had one lying around, the industry thing works also if you want to save some isk.
---
I started cheap until i felt save enough in J-Space, cheap ship fits etc... nlw i bling out my PVE Ships to fasten things up a little bit. 
---
i recommend a Legion for the Combat Anomalies (the green ones) - makes a lot of fun and is faster in my opinion than Tengu and Rattlesnake/Gila.

---
\- You can play on a connection speed like that but some things like massive fleet fights or Jita will cause issues, but it'll work.
---
\- Yes sure, these days EVE is easier to get in to than ever and given that EVE is a sandbox and thus you define your own "end game" and goals it won't limit you at all. Also, there's none of the "you weren't playing back then so you missed out on x gear type".
---
\- you accrue hit points over time, whether you're logged in or not. That means you can't power level, no point in grinding like mad or you miss out because RL got in the way. EVE has no levels, and while gear (ships and modules) help it's mostly about knowledge and experience. You can buy skill points, you can buy isk to buy gear, but you can't buy knowledge so there's NO point in trying to rush ahead. So take your time and focus on advancing you as a player, less so on your character.
---
\- technically no but skill points don't in any way define being ahead, first of all you have to specialise so if you focus on, say, interceptors, then you maxed out your skills after a year or so, meaning that someone who played for 15 years can't be any better than you having "just" played for 1 year. 
---
More importantly, as stated earlier, it's about knowledge and experience and let's be honest: most players are fcking terrible, lazy and uninformed. That means that an eager player who WANTS to get ahead and puts in the effort for that, CAN. And *that* means he'll be ahead of players who couldn't be bothered, even if they played for years.
---
Does it have a built in fan?
---
Same thing happened to me, but in an Apocalypse full fit for L4s . Been playing less than 6 months at the time, that one stung.
---
No, everyone will just use Domis
---
You aren't speed tanking a Domi. Look for new Meta to be Myrmidon and for those who want to bling running Isktars.
---
Last I checked, Omleca is a girl with great ideas to unfuck this game. She is one of the few who’s for pvp. hopefully she can end this stagnant game style and make it more of the terrifying game it use to be.
---
If you want to be low energy then a C3-LS can be pretty good, C3-HS really sucks if you get a shit exit (it takes some 50 minutes to solo roll), C3-NS is good if you want access to PVP but can be hard to get back if you get rolled out or podded out.
---
If you can find an unoccupied one (or one only occupied by a 1-man corp who you can evict) then a C2-C3/HS is the best for solo/small corps, you get a HS exit with the C2 that's less cancer to roll (30 mins or so to roll) and you have access to the C3 for ratting or finding PVP, the C3 can also provide a backup entryway if you get rolled/podded out.

Connection is probably fine, eve is not huge bandwidth eater, but only testing will tell.
---
Joining is now easier than ever. All major sides in null conflict have newbro program, so you can literally join what most peple consider endgame on day 1.
---
Leveling is and always was based on time - you select skills in game that you want to improve and they are slowly getting there. Now we also have mechanic where you can buy skillpoints (injectors) for ingame currency from other players who extracted their skills into this item, but I wouldn't worry about those for a while as they are expensive.
---
You can definitely "catch up". It may be difficult to have same number of skillpoints as some other people, but you really don't need to. This is not like leveling character in wow - big portion of skills are affecting only specific groups of ships, meaning unless you are currently sitting in them, those skillpoints give you no advantage over others. The way combat in eve is also lessens the importance of having perfect vs good skills - often you can get away with having skills at IV instead of V just fine, especially in larger fights.
---
Tbh this 'NCPL shit' it is getting bit boring now.        
---
Need to find something new to post about.
---
If the VNI gets nerfed, people will just move on to Gilas. Some have already used them for quite a while.
---
It is easier to go for that ratter as you now have more accurate intel. You know (with some exceptions) that what you see is what there is.
---
&gt; \- technically no but skill points don't in any way define being ahead, first of all you have to specialise so if you focus on, say, interceptors then you maxed out your skills after a year or so. Meaning that someone who played for 15 years can't be any better than you having "just" played for 1 year. 
---
Honestly one of my goals within- Hopefully the first year would be to make enough to Isk (and this is if I'm remembering things correctly)- But the goal for me would be to be successful enough to use Isk to buy membership each month. 
---
And honestly, some of these wars just seem fucking epic- I miss doing epic shit with epic people in MMO's.

Looking for a new afk ship so i can play other games.

That's pretty big, cool. You used the defaul model, no thickness modifications?

Just get rid of autopilot function imo
---
I got a feeling from your replies that it will be total waste of time. But I predicted that wardeccer side will start to lose more ships because of these changes and they are forced to try to defend the citadels.
---
 **Can I run Eve on a 2 MB Connection?** 
---
Yes. That should not be a point of concern. As long as it is a stable connection a large bandwith is not needed.
---
 
---
**Is there any point in joining now-a-days?** 
---
Yes. My main got created around 1 year ago and I can enjoy alot of stuff in the game.
---
I am certainly not in the same position as a dude who started like a decade ago, but I am having fun and that is the main reason for playing a game after all, right?
---
 **What type of leveling experience is it?**
---
There are no levels, but that is something you probably already know. Eve is based on a skill system. You can only equip or use stuff if you have the required skillset for it. You start with some basic skills and advance further down the list of " must train" skills over time.
---
I can recommend you the website of Eve University. There is a list of the "[Magic 14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14)" skills every player should have. That's where you should start.
---
 **Can I ever \*actually\* catch up?** 
---
You can buy so called skill injectors. They will grant you a certain amount of skill points which you then can apply to your skills and therefor "level" them up.
---
Those injectors are expensive - especially for new players... but they exist. 
---
The amount of skillpoints which you get out of those injectors [will decrease](https://puu.sh/DJGP9/9e9e17166b.png) with the total amount of skillpoints already on your character.
---
So basically you can catch up to a certain point IF you want to invest the IG currency or RL money needed to buy those suckers.  This however is NOT needed. You can even have fun with low SP characters. 
---
**TIPS:**
---
* If you want to start playing the game, use a referal link. That will grant your new character a total of 750k SP, which is quite alot to start with. This is [mine](https://www.eveonline.com/de/signup/?invc=54c117a6-9954-4042-8d0f-26e5fba0caaa) ... you can use it if you really want to, but I'd prefer it if you find someone in your timezone who will invest some time and actually help you out ingame afterwards. 
---
* Do not get frustrated if you die early on. Making mistakes is normal in eve and loosing some ships just is a part of this experience. If you get killed by a player, do not be afraid of mailing them a message and ask them about what you did wrong. There will certainly be shitheads, who will trashtalk you or simply not reply at all, but I believe most of the Eve community is quite nice to newbros and you might learn a couple of things this way.
---
* Try to join a group. Think about what you enjoy in a game. Is it PvP? PvE? Crafting? All of it together? Do you enjoy raids or being solo? Make yourself clear what your favored playstyle would be and ask questions here on reddit or even ingame about certain groups that do this kind of content on a daily basis. Join that group and try to learn stuff.
---
* Do NOT be afraid of leaving any group. Expand your horizon of knowledge... sticking with some people might not be a good idea. Look around and ask yourself if you are happy with the current sitation you are in. If not: change it.

ENJOY! :)

You're welcome to go hunt them, as they're fairly common already.
---
It's a running gag that some folks can't find the undock button with the accusation of being risk-adverse.
---
Who says it needs to be speedtanked?
---
Should be tilted towards the other direction.
---
wot is trash
---
I like your creativity. :)
---
what about people using ASIC miners these days ?
---
Longer answer: And the bots will keep botting while legit players get screwed.
---
I never AFK ratted in a VNI. Always at the helm, shooting the shit on fleet comms, watching intel channels, shooting the shit in fleet chat. Was just something relaxing to do for awhile between exploration runs and pvp.
---
&gt; But the goal for me would be to be successful enough to use Isk to buy membership each month. 
---
Don't set this as your goal. In my honest opinion paying with ISK for gametime feels really bad. 
---
If you are new and figures like 2.5b are still alot for you, paying that much on a monthly basis makes you feel like your character isn't progressing. Your skillpoints might go up over time, but if your wallet is constantly hovering just a bit over zero you will most likely feel unhappy about the situation.
---
I'd advise you to set your goal to something like "after 1 year I want to be in a position to start paying my gametime with ISK". Play the game without worrying if you can afford the upcoming month with your precious ISKies and rather invest the time you would put into grinding your gametime into stuff that will teach you how to get better at whatever you are doing ingame.
---
Y'all are just pissed that a someone who wants to shake up the constant buffs to ns is finally on the csm. I for one welcome someone who isn't going to sit quietly while null becomes even safer for the null bears.
---
Sorry this answer is a little late... i didnt read reddit for a while :D
---
boosh ravens can very much be countered by smaller fleets. 20 good pilot with the right ships can derail a fleet easily.
---
No?
---
The fact this idiot got elected is the main reason why I don't play eve anymore. 
---
The Trump of the CSM.
---
Same here. We put Stitch as our #1 guy hoping he would get in but i feel like he didnt have enough exposure by podcasts and stuff to make it happen. At least our #2 ExookiZ made it on instead so im ok with it.
---
[well....](https://imgur.com/a/wPpXzym)
---
Only took them 2 years.
---
Yet the process of actually attacking them is much much much much harder
---
Drone auto aggression is useful for mining ships when dealing with rats.
---
What the fuck is an nsa?
---
exooki is not THAT much of a surprise if you know that INIT voted for Stitch as #1 and ExookiZ as #2 which means he got most of the init votes since stitch didnt make it.
---
I liked it but only recognized nc and horde logos. Who are the other players?
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Ah yes the good ol' defensive wh cyno
---
Why does one have the Atari logo on it? Was eve published by them?
---
Simply put a Myrmidon is a better return on investment because they insure so well and are stupid cheap.
---
&gt;But the goal for me would be to be successful enough to use Isk to buy membership each month.
---
As per other poster: I'd not focus on that too early, if even at all. You're fine to remain Alpha for quite a while till you have a decent idea of all the options you really have (way more than you might think you have, trust me), from all those options you found your own niche and play style. And if that requires or simply works better with omega then go for it.
---
Thing is that you can work hard and you can work smart. If you remain semi-clueless then your only option is to work hard and THEN trying plex your account just makes the game in to a job and leaves you broke every month. If you found something you enjoy doing (and it's not super lazy afk gameplay, otherwise I'd probably pay shit) and choose to get GOOD at it you'll work smart, and then it's a lot easier to make good amounts of cash.
---
For instance, my chill/pve alt does combat exploration in high sec, on average I make 400-800 mil a day with it (I do play a lot though). And with that sort of income it would be super easy to plex the account. But I make that amount of cash because I know what I'm doing and have the experience to do it well. Would some alpha use a slightly less capable ship for it (I use an Ishtar) with decent but slightly less experience you could make some 200 mil a day with it, realistically. Still heaps of money and it doesn't even require omega so you could stay alpha, have good income, and do just fine.

Both Mango and Frat had Olmeca on their bloc lists btw.

X-Files the new Russian uber alliance was the "male" dance, see also  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bj9sxa/xfiles\_left\_tapi\_and\_found\_most\_powerful\_top1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bj9sxa/xfiles_left_tapi_and_found_most_powerful_top1/)

Briefly.
---
lol ok yeah
---
 *National Security Agency*
---
They already have f2p and sold out to another company what else is there?
---
&gt;and they are forced to try to defend the citadels.
---
they aren't, they did it for fun
---
source: i was there
---
Need a tldr and a reee section
---
Here's some variety for you
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77440446/
---
Yeah like I said didn’t expect ccp to drop the ball that hard again. 
---
Anyway: made you undock and try to fight. There was no reason for defenders to do anything before. Now there is - even more so when it gets fixed.
---
that want what you were implying originally now was it?  
---
So now let me get this right; you would want to get together 15 people to kill one proteus?  
---
seems like a bit much tbh
---
This is a very roundabout way of asking for limiting force projection
---
&gt;Anyway: made you undock and try to fight. There was no reason for defenders to do anything before. Now there is - even more so when it gets fixed.
---
still no reason- other than they want to
---
they did it because they wanted to, not because they had to
---
Bot man bad.
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Just for you:
---
Tl;dr Ban the bots and fine their corporations/alliances for 2x amount of taxes earned fron bots.
---
&gt;No viable counter
---
&gt;Links an example of bumping failure
---
I have no words
---
The absolute minimum is a covert ops cloak but you’re gonna want to do some damage to get in on the kills. 
---
Like the others said check out the fits in the in game chat channel. Bear in mind that there are different types of fleets which require different fits, for example later today we have a Stuka fleet which needs a different fit to the armada fleets.
---
&gt; If the rent corporation balance goes into negative and they wont pay their debt within a month, it gets transferred to an alliance they were in at the moment of bans.
---
what if they're in a separate rental alliance?
---
We cyno tanked now bois
---
r/theydidthemonstermath

r/themonstermath
---
What about trigs or jobs ships?
---
So whats this mean the vni is getting only 4 heavy slots? Or none at all? If vni ratting gets ruined you can count me and my subs out of the game cause thats literally all i have left to do now is krab while i skill into the pvp ships i want to use...
---
so the change wouldn't really affect you much then, just change hull and keep doing what you're doing.
---
Lmao nah, hope you lose next year too tbh
---
There is no need for thickness modifications, anything can be a dildo if you're brave enough
---
The game won’t give you an option to reprocess stacks of raw ore under 100 quantity.  The new player orientation also tell you this
---
New player here if they nerf my vni im legit saying fuck this game and going back to scam citizen and planetslide 2
---
It hurts because it's true.
---
ok, just wantto say thank you and give you a quick update. First ninja loot, it paid up well :D 
---
https://i.imgur.com/tdfsFHh.png
---
The best part ? I did not even notice it was the rattlesnake that just died to the trig until I checked the cargo :D I thought it was a trig wreck.I even had the luxury to salvage it :D
---
Great thank you. Are the triglavian ships better than the T2 logi? They seem quite powerful with the damage and neut bonus.
---
Thank you I will check out the fits.
---
It's what I was planning to do, just don't know which ship to go with between Gila, Domi and Myrm.
---
Being at the right place at the right moment, but I'm happy I could help you !
---
That's an easy half a bil you made there, congratulations =)
---
Have some fun harvesting the tears of the BBabies, god speed! 
---
*I'm taking 50% on that loot, thank you (joke)*
---
Judging by that guy's killboard, he has more money than sense.
---
You still don't get it. Before the was rarely situations where the defenders could have done anything. Now there is a clear objective each time you declare a war.
---
You gained more from this. You got a whole new gameplay style out of it. You now have lots of new content you get out of these wars every week. And once you figure out how to spread the wars to different HQ's, who to wardec and when + what kind of fleetcomps work best for defending citadels you will have the upper hand again. But you will also lose more ships and assets while doing it because now the defenders are more organized.
---
Which would be an awesome desired outcome.
---
What about my praxis with one of each weapon type fitted
---
Why with only BS?
---
Can't roll a C3 with a carrier and BCs down have even less mass so take **way** more runs.
---
This though did cross my mind. Perhapf after 2 month of no paying the rental alliance get forcefully dissolved and everyone in the game gets a message about it? Regulation not through money, but through shame.
---
you can have the scourge heavy missiles :d
---
They aren't on the cheat sheet, you just need to memorize those, like your times tables...
---
fick
---
Well, ISK is ISK !
---
(can I have the blue stuff pls)

it was a sarcastic comment

Can you tl;dr that now please

---
Come, join us, jump in, it’s the only way to be sure.
---
Ban, fine.
---
It's ishtars by the looks of it... Check Saturday's volumes
---
Very nice work. By comparison, by the way, the estimated carrying capacity of Earth is 22 billion.
---
Tl;dr reeeeee
---
CcP already removes that money, usually making wallets negative. As to your idea, you are putting (and CcP already is) the onus on an alliance to police every member in fear of being "neq-walleted".
---
On the surface this sounds good, but is it? These players that are now responsible, are not given tools beyond the ESI to do so. Grinding through raw data is a job we are paying CCP for and not alliance members (paying players).
---
As far as exploits, join an alliance and start botting to weaponize the fines. Take the isk to the space laundromat (jita).
---
Perfect thanks.
---
&gt; A slow ship with a horrible align time.

Networked Sensor Array.
---
are you stupid?
---
That is amazing!
---
&gt; You still don't get it. Before there was rarely situations where the defenders could have done anything. Now there is a clear objective each time you declare a war.
---
and when the novelty wears off and no one attacks war HQs, or if they continue and the defenders just use 600m throwaway structures- what really changes?
---
people will just win trade on the staging keepstar undock.
---
&gt; So, when an botting account gets banned, CCP should fine its corporation.
---
no
---
Yes, but is cheaper and you can insure it. Ticks might be less, but for people using a lot of VNI alts it will probably be better.
---
He took a look at the mechanics, developed a niche gameplay and then built it into a large scale campaign against the most powerful alliance in Eve.  Not many randoms in this game could manage that.  I'll take someone with the skills and ability to develop that "niche form of gameplay" over someone who doesn't understand the game at all...
---
I don't have a problem with Aryth.
---
Thanks for the link mate :)
---
Ahh you got me. I may not ever recover from such a savage burn.
---
I will, however, remember this post and laugh the next time someone complains about their roaming gang getting dropped in delve. (since 7 to 1 odds is acceptable by your metrics)
---
Have a great day!
---
let's not get carried away, shall we ? :D
---
&gt;The other drone ships are actually expensive enough that its not sustainable if you loose them repeatedly
---
False.  Myrms pay for themselves in fewer ticks than a VNI
---
Who? You mean the guy who had to crowd fund a space game because no major publisher would consider a sci to game on that scale?
---
I mean, thats kind od the point.  Look at tv, how many current Sci fi and spaceship shows do you see compared to things like fantasy shows , super hero shows and cop shows etc etc.  Or look at any of the general earnings studies that compare what mystery or political thriller writers make compared to sci to writers.
---
Aa sci fi fans we tend to grossly overestimate the appeal of our favorite genre. Its why sci fi fans are constantly dismayed at how quickly and easily sci fi shows get cancelled when all this other crap on tv gets 4-6 seaaons on average.
---
Face it, we're weird lol.
---
Newplayer here. Paid for 23m sp on one toon and paid for 5m sp on another. If i had to wait for all of that id have quit on day one. It is now day 14. And i will not be logging in anymore especially after the vni nerf. Having to boringly rat was already going to male me quit but now that theyve decided to take that away from me after i put all that money into it. Ive decided to cut my losses im done with this overrated boring ass screen saver good luck eve. Im going back to scam citizen with its bugs at least they take my money and allow me to attempt to actually dog fight.
---
&gt;Can I run Eve on a 2 MB Connection?
---
Yes, although there are some activities that may suffer slightly.
---
&gt;Is there any point in joining now-a-days?
---
Arguable, as the game is in a pretty bad rut due to CCP's incompetence. Some large groups have unitedly quit the game altogether due to CCP's before a mentioned incompetence, but as a new player you might enjoy it?
---
&gt;What type of leveling experience is it?
---
Passive. The biggest progression in eve in unironically your personal progression of understanding the game. Learning the game is progression, as skills can all be bought, and don't necessarily get you to where you want to go.
---
&gt;Can I ever *actually* catch up? 
---
If I started eve right now, with my knowledge, with nothing, it wouldn't effect me too much. This isn't because I hardly play any more, but my personal knowledge of the game can carry me to my current level in a month.
---
Please, Darkness are a valuable member of the blue donut.
---
How easy is it supposed to be?
---
CCP really does remove corporation money after banning bots? First time I hear of it.
---
r/itwasagraveyardgraph
---
You're less than a one day train to being able to AFK in a more affordable Dominix.
---
Well, the weapons and stuff like that have Modells, let's take a scale for example 1:1000. Perfect for ships, allmost every ship. And they/ you make the Modell and 3d print it with every weapon type that you have. Better said you print the weapons. It kinda depends on you what you want.
---
I actively fit ships for haven running on sisi when it's pick hour on TQ. I have found a sweet stratios that gives about 40mil tickets and it costs about 140mil to fit. It's nearly invisible on the site and I almost always spawn a dread. My theory is that the sites escalate much more often when rats have a hard time applying damage to you and when you deal a significant amount of damage.
---
Yeah, that might happen. But if the mechanics get fixed then that 2 week immunity and guaranteed killmail is often worth it.
---
"we want the game to get better"
---
Lmfao
---
Based on what little I know about you. I would work hard to control your mindset going into these meetings and remain calm. 
---
I mean - that might be an unfair thing for me to say, but I believe your passion and excitability has gotten you into trouble in the past. 
---
I'm routing for you. Dealing with a organized company, there needs to be a professionalism and a calm behind your passion for you to get the results we all desire. 
---
Good luck in those meeting rooms bud, you're our voice now. 
---
cheers,
---
I think we will, some people paying attention to local will go for Ishtars, others for Gilas, and we'll probably see a lot of Myrms and Domis aswell, being used without much care because they are just so easy to replace.
---
This is a nice post but it makes a little bit too many assumptions for my taste. You use a strange mix of mathematics from pixel-size and real-world numbers, and that is why your number is most likely way off.   
---
Even with very high density and every planet populated, operating one Keepstar only would drown the population of entire constellations if not regions. Nobody would construct such a monstrosity... because it could not be run at all. 
---
It is more likely, that the real number is around or even less than 1billion and that it's not 60% of habitable space, but rather ship hangars (titans are big), technical equipment and simply storage (don't forget how big the markets on some of those are...). And why would you need 100b people anyways?
---
Eve is not dead
---
Because (some of) the type of people running vnis are running them because they can truly AFK.  The losses are built into their profits.  VNIs pay themselves off after ~7 ticks.  After 7 AFK ticks, you don't care if you lose it.  Ishtars are closer to 14 (numbers might be a bit off, as this analysis was done some time ago, but general point stands).  Are you confident that you can go max AFK and not lose your Ishtar in 14 ticks?  Then it might be worth it.  
---
On the other hand, sure the Myrm makes less than a VNI, but it pays for itself in 4-5 ticks.  If you're just running a bunch of AFK accounts, that starts to look tempting.  It's also a lot quicker/cheaper to spool up a set of AFK Myrm pilots.  vOv
---
Love the content. Keep it coming.
---
why wont NC feed to our 3x titan numbers?
---
fucking dumb cunt
---
So your suggestion is to make non botters pay for the crimes of botters and that will fix botting, I can see why you don't work in CCP security.
---
You are aware that test does not have a condi ticker, right?
---
Logging out is not a viable, ingame counter to bumping, and is not always possible (i.e. freighter bumping). All ingame mechanics should have ingame counter mechanics.
---
I disagree. The magic 14 literally affect everything. Everything outside of that is choice, but you can't do anything meaningful without those skills, since they have such a big impact (5% PG, etc.) and everyone is expected to have them
---
Wtf?
---
Can't bridge cloaked.
---
Will probably go Gila since I'm a low SP character. Possibly go Domi when I get my SP up higher.
---
how many of those 10k get invited to an alliance/corp within the first day?
---
the only addition I need to the launcher is a button to launch a char
---
Thanks!
---
So say you run an alliance of a thousand people. Who spends hours running ESI queries and collating that data?  Who then follows up and watches those players for botting? How many hours a week does this person spend his lesure time policing botting for the company he pays? It is not just "not ideal" it's ludicrous.
---
I see two ways to combat them at the moment. One is dense populations so players who use the space (and do not want to share it with bots) will report them. The other is CcP investing in a learning AI that can monitor the cluster, report behaviors to the security team, and learn as new tricks are implemented by not programmers.
---
I can't fathom this. _Only_ four accounts. Where are you six Titan accounts, supers, etc. I'm in shock. I need a line of fine ground Spodumain. 🤒
---
Things did happen. Until things stop happening my point stands.
---
Eyyy today's your lucky day https://github.com/Kyle-Cerniglia/EvE-3D-Printing/tree/master/ships
---
Who said that?
---
So you want to be able to drop on a ratter and if you cant, you consider it too difficult to kill that ratter?
---
To keep the game interesting. 
---
Remember that, above all else, Eve is a game, and games should be fun. Different people will have different ideas of what is "fun", but without a certain degree of mechanical safety, people's "fun" will be hindered.  
---
Asset safety is a good example. For all the complaining about it, it provides a level of mechanical safety to assets that prevents someone quitting because they lost all their stuff.
---
You apparantly can't search for that in the search field. 
---
Find a random killmail of the ship/region you would like to lookup and click on the linked stuff in the mail itself.
---
Same here when trying last night (Saturday US)
---
this is after an attempt to 'streamline' :D
---
Was that actually their ballot header?  There were only about 500 Stitch -&gt; ExookieZ direct vote transfers when Stitch got eliminated, which means they were likely the bulk of them.
---
I like your style
---
Oh no it's a lot of trouble
---
What are the odds exactly? I mean, people can definitely catch a wh by looking on warp direction, but
---
1) How can they be certain about alignment? My only guess is the shift of the ship's signature on dscan.
---
2) If the ship has decent warp speed you'll need specifically fitted counter to outrun the target. Or there are some other tricks I am not aware off.
---
3) Does it have any connections to the wh exploration routine, like scanning all sites and holes down, before engaging the target?
---
Please stop with these suggestion posts, nobody likes them and almost all the idea's are bad.
---
The Cost of Jumping: Adding random stats to ship hulls won't work because as soon as you repackage the ship everything gets lost and your change will be useless.
---
Rorquals: The panic already shields barges when they are in the same fleet and can already function as a transport ship using their ship maintenance bay.
---
You can remove the ability to use drones but there have been better suggestions like make it a fighter mechanic so people will need to actively use them.
---
Citadels: Just make them easier to kill, reduce the timers and remove damage caps.
---
Damage and Repair Curves: why N+1 is a legit strategy and you should be able to headshot people, picking the right people to alpha can decide the fight, do you alpha dps or logi, FC headshot? have backups.
---
"Why deploy 500 to bash a Citadel when only 250 are effective?"
---
This is already the case with the current damage cap system.
---
Skill Injector Curve: Already the case, the more skillpoints you have the less you get from injectors.
---
Skill Injector Addiction: This just punishes players without isk/ people who only have one account it won't stop people who are injecting alts as they probably won't care about the debuff and will just wait it out.
---
Contracted Bounties: Not that bad, anything is better than what we have now.
---
Finite Resources: The idea of limited resources can work but if you base it on one alliance then you punish region where different alliances live together, tweaking anom respawn rates is a much better way to do this.
---
Empire Sprawl Penalties: We just got ACL for jump bridges and you already want to take them away? If you base anything on the size of an alliance or corp people will start to make holding corps to not be affected by the debuffs.
---
There already is a cost to owning more sov, its called the "sovereignty bill".
---
Region Depletion: So first you invest in a region, put structures down wait for the indexes to go up so you can actually use the space effectively and then you need to move?
---
Gate Events: buildable/destroyable gates would be great but as you said to disruptive, people will just make their nice farm system with one gate bubbles, maybe tie the new invasions into this, temp disable gates or something like that.
---
End Coalitions: You can't end coalitions, people will always group together, if you can't set them blue the FC's will just look at the ticker and not target call them. Or they will just merge into one big alliance with lots of corps like goonswarm.
---
Remove nullification: why, there needs to be a way to escape bubble caps.
---
That explains so much about him.
---
Given that poses are still ingame, it won't make the game safer for titans and supers, since no small group would risk their titan bridging from an astra when an undeniably mechanically superior option exists. 
---
Besides, this was *always* part of the plan. New structures must provide *all* of the functionality of the old structures. This is simply one of the last functions on the list.
---
For everybody asking about buying these, remember that you can use services like 3D Hubs to order 3D printed parts.
---
Oh Evictus sad noises
---
The liquor
---
I always use NSA on my super. 
---
Il be just fine in delve.
---
He’s a great CSM member.
---
I usually put him as my number one spot.
---
See, but all of those representatives have extensive game knowledge that they can offer to CCP like a sounding board.
---
I’m not in GSF, but after listening to all of the CSM interviews that TiS and Jintaan did, I knew that the people that I voted for are interested in keeping the game alive and healthy.
---
You gotta vote for *people*, not for Alliance tags.
---
I like citadels but that mooring bit is way too over the top for safety.  Its a change nobody asked for and is utterly unnecessary.  Pls dont do.
---
I bet you didn’t listen to any of their interviews on Talking in Stations
---
You really didn’t listen to any of their interviews, huh?
---
Because if you had, you wouldn’t sound so ignorant right now.
---
It was very similar to this when I was on the CSM 5-6 years ago
---
This has been about par for the course for most of EVE's life.   Hell even I quit in under 14 days the first two times I tried it.
---
Perhaps "risk / risk-adverse" isn't the best name for it, but everyone is somewhere on that spectrum at all times as its a variant of " don't fly what you can't afford to lose".
---
Specifically, willingness to accept risk is based on the ease with which the potential loss can be replaced.  
---
For example, I can easily replace a destroyer if it blows up, so I'm willing to risk losing it for other gains, such as pvp, pve, or defending someone.  
---
A battleship, by contrast, would be more difficult to replace, so I am more cautious with them.
---
How much risk someone is willing to accept is based, therefore, on how long it would take to replace the loss. If someone has 20 rorqs in deep null with super support, they aren't going to care if they lose one of their titans. Conversely, if someone has the only titan in their entire alliance, and had to buy it and sneak it into their own territory, then they are going to be much more careful with it *because of the difficulty in replacing the loss*
---
Aye its a shitter.
---
&gt;You are not wrong, edited and replaced google drive link with my new YouTube channel :)
---
When in doubt, shoot thermal

Why would you want to fix afk ratting? Afk players and broken bots are basically all you can tackle (and pray for a response) or kill roaming
---
I think that's a guns thing, since thermal usually has high DPS. With missiles all the DPS is the same, so I try to go straight for the hole
---
Kinda hard to plan when there is no ingame counter play.  
---
Also, 90 bil is a lot to some people, and thats not including the other costs involved, especially if you can't build them locally.
---
Professional do nothing
---
TIL I'm 75% of the 4 voters who just used your ballot because it looked good enough and couldn't be arsed to research. Now go show the kneelers who's boss!
---
Lmao at one point he starts repping the trig rats when he applied his drones.
---
Can’t say I haven’t done that but it hurts to see.
---
Yeah there's no way I was voting for a nullblobber, so no I didn't.
---
What did they say, they are all going to change the blobby capital proliferation home defense mechanics?
---
Not arguing one way or the other, but that sounds like collective punishment.  (My impression is that collective punishment generally either causes everyone to be at each others' throats *or* close ranks so that nobody gets reported.)

stain voted for u with all our reliks...hope u gona change something,good luck mate
---
just because a thing happened, doesn't mean it's optimal or going to continue to happen
---
Each shared folder can then have subfolders, which will replace the current folders within corp bookmarks. Those subfolders don't need a low limit (and have no limit at all so far in the prototype). So you could have a single shared folder for your corp, which has 12 subfolders, and then use the other  shared folders for other purposes.

Eve is still dying.

Earth at our current level of tech and urbanization*

If we were to completely urbanize Earth, akin to this keepstar, we could fit trillions of people on the surface.

lol
---
By the way I posted a little video you FW fans might find amusing.

Not overselling - it's basically a clip from Bjorn Bee's stream sandwiched in between a beg/end transition slide.   However what he says about our activities is just perfect....

---
Just have people who are AFK ratting complete a captcha to keep ratting.
---
Your posting
---
gonna have to pay for omega, gonna be a longer SP time to be as effective, and getting caught is signifigantly more expensive.
---
I'm in the same situation. I played eve in a very Comptitiv PvP group. The way I played it is no more possible. A bit of eve on the phone during a midday break sounds like fun though.
---
soo, setup a heavy botting corp, join enemy renting alliance, bot down hard, have your enemies get punished?
---
Good point. Carrying capacity is determined by consumption of resources versus existing supply, which could easily be altered by advancement in recycling, importing resources from space, etc.
---
Olmeca's alt reddit account probably ^
---
Me too, man. Me too.
---
whats the fit, if l may ask ?
---
... okay.
---
Aki itself no, thankfully it isn't camped. Nearby is fighty in eutz.
---
ECM is alive and well, Ecm drones were on me and i couldnt get within range of the guy to target him. Seems like you are just upset that you have to target and kill the rats. Suggestion, run drones and let them do the work. Stop complaining.
---
That's a lot of work for me to resub too. Chance are it won't happen.
---
stop telling people to go to null blocs you idiots
---
this is why people leave the game. because they don't learn how to play it their way and have fun their way
---
op don't listen to anyone telling you to go to brave/karmafleet/horde, if you want to join the blob you'll find it out for yourself. I'll recommend Eve University, since they aren't trying to suck taxes out of you and you can learn the parts of the game you find interesting
---
If you want to be 100% safe, dock.
---
Not in fleet, dude derped. Purple arrow, friendly militia.
---
It's our space and they want it now.
---
Why not? It removes the only thing liable to die in their space while ratting.
---
No. There's no comparable ship (imo) that an alpha can fly to do the same type of near afk drone ratting that they could do in a VNI. The closest to is a Myrm, which is just worse in almost every way than a VNI was.
---
They even bot the downvotes.
---
can Myrms be piloted by Alphas? I quit like...not even a month after the alpha update so I havn't looked into it. Debating getting back in
---
Or just delay local and fix everything
---
If your fit and piloting is so shit you get caught by a heavy drone in a keres, you deserve to die in a fire.
---
The argument in favor is that you are effective drastically out of proportion to the cost of your ship and the amount of SP you have.  It's an incredible force multiplier.
---
The argument against, as you noted, is that frigates are pretty flimsy.  You need a lot of player skill (as distinct from SP) to do it well under fire.  Tackling well is *really* hard, and it also requires a certain amount of luck.  I'm really bad at it, but I have corpmates who aren't, and sometimes they look like wizards.
---
It's probably more forgiving to start with cruisers.  They're versatile, they move relatively quickly, T1 cruisers with T2 fittings cost on the order of 10-20M, and they can do everything from heavy tackle to line DPS depending on how you build them and the needs of the fleet that you're in.
---
They kind of try to do that sometimes. Problem is that the drones end up killing the rats first.
---
This just makes drone boats a nearly non-viable PvE option no? It doesn't fix the problem just swings it from one extreme (Drone boats being by far and away the best) to another.
---

---
There are many more from the past too
---
And ofc I dont know the politics here or in the past, I have a real life. I do know the only way to get a decent change levied is through the CSM.  
---
Try naming something the CSM has accomplished or helped implement that was beneficial into the game?
---
should have nerfed the Power so the 100Mb AB wont fit  besides the Drones bandwidth.
---
&gt; Goal  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Have smaller fleets attacking each other and targets. Why deploy 500 to bash a Citadel when only 250 are effective? Deploy 250 to another objective or to support the first 250 by closing down gates or starting a second timer.  
---
&gt;Why drop 20 titans to alpha another titan when only 10 are effective and you are putting an additional 10 are risk for nothing?
---
You do not deploy additional forces to be more effective. You deploy them to make sure the force you are deploying is safe
---
what role does he play in the imperium?
---
&gt;*great* grandchildren 
---
ftfy
---
Question why nester . Who even uses nester 🤣
---
Compare the Cost of the Gila to the VNI, and then see how agile both are.
---
The Gila will make a great ratting ship, but it will bring NS to the higher risk for the reward it gives.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76985231/
---
&gt; Jump Bridges, Cyno Bridges and Titan Bridges are not gates. They are jury rigged solutions built by what are essentially outlaw fiefdoms, as such, much like a dirt road shortcut versus a highway, it will beat the hell out of your suspension, rattle your brain around and eventually your engine will fall out of the chassis if you use them frequently enough and at their built in high speeds.
---
Good job on starting your screed with complete nonsense. Imagine thinking the latest flagship products from Upwell are the equivalent of dirt roads. 
---
I stopped reading after this paragraph as the rest is bound to be just as bad.
---
Don't accept a heavy botting corp into your alliance.
---
Same. PoS shields were a work around because you couldn’t dock. You can dock now. That said, there’d need to be a replacement for large pos super storage, or Keepstars will be mandatory for any alliance to have a super fleet and that’s an INSANE barrier to meet.
---
It's already totally different because no neutral logistics. It is already 1000x better.
---
The version I heard was that Some Russians held their mouse wierd and it looked like a crab, which turned into an insult to people that pve so much they get fucked up joints.
---
Some people want to get in on the action. No one said anything about forcing.
---
Can you imagine the shitstorm and autistic screeching that would follow?
---
Yeah, CCP wont take that risk.
---
Boil em mash em stick em in a stew
---
Not all vni is [bots, and you](https://bots.you/) may just crash a bunch of newbies, which gets a nail in this dying eve coffin.gj.
---
Not even used in  Gallente FW .  Its ok Maybe it will Push the the Navy Brutix BPs more on the market.  Since the Burtix is more of a PVP ship.
---
It’s not the game it’s YOUR SHITTY ATTITUDE 
---
lmao /r/evelets blown the fuck out
---
Unfortunately yep. Imagine being that angry about having to actually play the game.
---
Who makes money of this game and who's game is it??? Right CCP. Why should we as players, do the work for CCP's security team? I hope for ccp this game is profitable and there for the should want to invest in keeping the game fair (as fair as possible within the game mechanics) and safe.
---
Hardly.
---
My point is ismply that the cynos timer hurts hunters more than it hurts the defense.
---
The target of the change isn't bottling, it's afk infinitely scalable income, which, regardless of your personal story/playstyle is terribad for the game on several levels.
---
First of all, vnis are impossible to catch. Second, they have better DPS than the battleship that serves the same role because of all the low slots you can use when speed tanking. Third, they're ridiculously strong as far as cruisers go. Now couple that with the fact that each generates 60m per hour with no attention required and bam, people start to multibox them like crazy and all you see wherever you go is vnis.
---
Bots get dealt with in much more sophisticated ways, as evidenced by the banwaves we see every now and then. Not to say CCP shouldn't do more about them, but it's a different problem with different solutions.
---
As for what you can do, you can either switch to a dominix, with the only difference being the range you warp to in sites and the align time being longer, or find one of the fits that make double the money or more but require attention, and do that for much less time. Not to mention, there's other more effective ways of making isk other than spinning around forsaken hubs.
---
Besides, I'm sure you hate when all you see is ratting vnis when you go roaming on your weekend. Slashing the vni's afk ticks by 40% was a great call.
---
If this is true you’d think ccp would be a bit more worried about long term players quitting
---
Depends how it's implemented really. 
---
At the moment, PVE sites have very limited scripting in them, it's almost always identical spawns, maybe a little bit of randomisation and the odd faction spawn. This technology is very outdated and much better tech already exists (incursions, FOBs, sleepers etc).
---
If you've been AFK drone boating and using heavies to just blap cruiser after cruiser, react by throwing in increasing numbers of elite frigs in each spawn. 
---
Still fairly easy to blap by switching out to some lights with good speed and tracking, but you have to actually make a decision to do so, you can't just put the client into the background and let drone agro do the job for you.

You and fuzzy Steve had my vote, congratulations
---
Watch this: https://youtu.be/sZA8RmQNzes and you can see how flying tackle well takes a lot of skill and is pretty intense.
---
You might be right but I’m pretty sure no new player makes it to null sec in their first few weeks/months . And keeping them playing in a that time and allowing even ~20% of them to give null sec alliances a try is pretty important for the growth or life of the game. And I know that retaining long term player is for the most part better than new ones since they’ve been contributing to revenue, but either way they have to do something.
---
And my cheap ass was living in a 20m² Captains Appartement for years. I think i got screwed over.
---
Because the other 40% is housing supers
---
You think bots cant press f and target?
---
What large groups unitedly quit?
---
I don't mind (and possibly agree with) this as a balance pass on VNIs specifically, they always felt out of place with their ability to field 5 heavies and fit 100MN as a T1 cruiser. I just hope it's not the vanguard of a bunch of nerfs aimed at removing this playstyle altogether.
---
Look at the guy who got like 300mil?
---
Supers can barely hit 10x a vni's income actually if both are at max skill. Meanwhile, a super takes more than 10x the training time, and costs... several hundred times what a fitted vmi does. And also scrams itself whenever it uses the NSA and takes some 30-40 seconds to align.
---
Have you tried putting the region id in the url like you do for advanced searching?
---
Damn ya F1 monkeys ..

Come to Kinakka and lets 1v1 at the sun please .
---
What's tribute?
---
So it’s not just me. I was looking for WH activity while spelunking and it wouldn’t find them. I was on Firefox so I’m guessing it’s zKill
---
Honest question: Why?
---
sure but it's more annoying than just killing some npc in a belt/anom and that way wormhole playerscan do their quest
---
Wait, when did BCs cost 25 mil with the fit? The lowest I remember was just under 20m for the cheap hulls, and another 20 for the complete t2 fit.
---
Mate, those are groups. Every group there has no less than 10 accounts in it.
---
Hmmm, so he only discusses goons and only whales in their space because he hates all of null blocs equally?  That's too funny.
---
Not saying its not good money, but the point remains that for a space game it had to happen that way, where as game companies and publishers are willing to risk their own money on more popular genres woth needing crowd funding schemes.
---
Star Citizen proves the point, sci fi isnt as popular and thus profitable as sci fi fans like to think it is.  In Eve's case that means that no matter what you do it will only ever attract so many people.
---
Skill urself
---
Yup.  Download from the GitHub link and scaled down 15%.  Sliced up in to 8 printable parts.  I’ll get the stls up on thingiverse today.
---
Youd need to be in site for like over an hour to align out of drone control range lmao
---
/u/squizz might know
---
And it was found that Brisc Rubal did, in fact, NOT violate any rules. In fact, he never was removed for RMT, but for an accusation of an NDA breach.
---
Most of the changes to the NPE are due to input from the CSM. The recent changes to faxes was based off of their input. There are two for starters.
---
Wow, that's a whole lot of nonsense, how long did you spend on it?
---
You do know those ads are based on YOUR Google searches?
---
The only reason you are seeing it is because Google knows enough about you to think you might like EVE but not enough to know you already play EVE
---
New to Eve? Yes, I only started playing in 2010.
---
afaik he had to rewrite part of the search because something went poof during an update.
---
No, but it appears you are.
---
So in 9 years you've failed to learn some basic piloting and what items do?
---
For reference. A United state Nimitz class aircraft carrier can house 6000 people. By ccps estimations a frigate is just a bit smaller than an aircraft carrier. This thing could easily hold 300b people without trying.
---
You forget how fucking big space is. Also how much crew these ships have. Supercapitals have crews of hundreds of thousands if not millions. Those people have family's too, they would probobly all live on the keep star since they sure as shit arent living in a military vessel. 
---
As for importing food. Literally 1 harvest planet in the region is usually more than enough to sustain a region and any halfway competent space empire is going to have multiple planets purely devoted to food growing to feed other planets and stations.
---
Water recycling is easy enough shit we do it on our modern day aircraft carriers.
---
Let's not forget the logistics of people you need to run this station. You need docking people who guide the ships in. You need repairman who operate machinery you need repairman who fix that machinery. You need engineers, doctors, scientists. All those people have family's who likely live on the station.
---
You also have people responsible for upkeepong the station which is fucking massive btw. They have family's too. Janitors schools for all these family's children. Teachers, more doctors for children.
---
We haven't even gone into entertainment for these billions of people.
---
Because it still scrolls down for a while ....
---
Most of KarmaFleet has gotten their Supers from ratting with Myrms and VNIs. 
---
You know, the largest Super Fleet by corp in game.
---
But sure, I'll let you wax poetic on using an easily catchable battleship that costs a ton more than a Battleship.
---
Jeebus fuck he loses a lot of shiny shit.
---
Wormholers use them all the time.
---
I meant why that many accounts?
---
[here is that data fitted in R /ggplot2](http://imgur.com/gallery/jj16ThL)

At 100 m/s you would be over 60km away in 10 minutes.  I meam, math isn't THAT hard.
---
Oh, I know what they do. I also know that running a Domi is not coat effective compared to other methods. Quit being dumb.
---
Imagine whaling in the region with most whales, he must be dumb
---
Nimitz class accomodation is utter misery though.
---
This isn't rimworld we're playing
---
That's not at all what you said, quit being dumb.
---
Maybe just fucking move out of the way? That's a hard counter right there.
---
I've recruited about half a dozen various folk I've shot at whilst hunting and camping. A lot of good humans and the first friends I've really made in Eve. In fact most of the pilots I'm space friends with are those I've shot at or vice versa.
---
He only uses examples from a singular region when trying to make his points. That DOES show a bias. Maybe if your hate boner wasn't so apparent you could see it as well.
---
How does this compare to other MMOs?
---
Yep.  Alphas can train Battlecruisers to 4.  I think the only thing an alpha can't use on a typical Myrm ratter is a micro jump drive, which isn't necessary, just nice.
---
This was literally promisef when citadel were announced.
---
Umm, citadels didn't exist at the time of wwb.
---
Qh right right. It was on co2s first keepstar death. Shortly thereafter
---
It isn't cost effective. Biggest reason is because it is too easy to catch. Now, please, shut up and let the adults talk.
---
Also, does this mean he is moving to Branch? Them leading the MER and all.
---
Especially if your doing it afk or running lots of alphas. Just adjust the drone like you said and continue on. Ticks may suffer but it’s afk anyway so it doesn’t matter.
---
Sure if you wanna fatigue your super fleet saving domis go ahead. Just means fewer people jumping in to save rorqs and ratting caps/supers.
---
Hyperspatial Hel of course
---
If you light a cyno with that fit the rats will kill you. 
---
If you fit for active armor or active shield, there is no way to tank a haven, deal optimal dps, and have a cyno
---
CCP more hats please
---
Well then you would have to shoot more than one target at a time or guard the gates.
---
Shot at a t1 frigate in highsec with a 900m artillery sleipnir, and got concorded.

I forgot where I was and had my safety off. xD

I’m just wondering if domi bots will be able to tell when they’re tackled and will either neut a tackler off or mjd away
---
I do now :)
---
In video game development parlance a whale is a person who pays far more than the average. Ironic they ( I use they as gender neutral singular, per. SJWs) hate what we call whales in game while being one of another type.
---
But the system doesn't really contribute to alliance income, so how can a new alliance get financed?
---
there is a problem with this and a reason they don't do it, and the reason why is really fucking scary and shocking.
---
&gt; The Cost of Jumping: Adding random stats to ship hulls won't work because as soon as you repackage the ship everything gets lost and your change will be useless.

Can't repackage damaged modules.

&gt; Gate Events:

NPC only

For capital pilots theres a little know "Jump Navigation Window" thats by default NOT keybound for some strange reason.  It is quite possible one of the most useful things available to a capital pilot, and should probably be mentioned somewhere as it displays all available jump points currently in range to the pilot when opened.
---
Uploaded everything to Thingiverse.  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3709250](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3709250).  All parts and stand are there.  Feel free to hit me up in game "Dr DeWitt" or DM on reddit for any questions. 
---
I think cap stable dual rep VNIs would've worked
---
there is a limit?
---
I mean, they are no WiNGSPAN Delivery Services.
---
Personal hangar sections like we have for corp hangars and hangars that work with access lists.
---
So long, they're nerfing it.  Fuck off and don't let the door hit you on the way out, if you can't adapt to change this game isn't for you.
---
I can tell you exactly what will happen and how it will happen without any risk of The Plan~ being jeopardized. Reddit has unwittingly flexed it's voting potential to put Olmeca Gold onto the CSM. There is a reason Olmeca Gold didn't appear on any Imperium ballots. We couldn't allow for any indication that we actually wanted him on the CSM. Not even to our line members, it had to be you; reddit that put him there...
---
Reddit puts Olmeca on the CSM with the hopes that he will be something other than an embarrassment. The scandals that surface involving gobbins and olmeca will further deincentivise the [/r/eve](https://www.reddit.com/r/eve) crowd from participation in CSM. Reddit voter turnout will see an all time low, paving the way for an even more powerful GoonSwarm voting bloc. This will have ripple effects causing a sharp drop in viable non-bloc candidates and a sharp increase in NPC candidates designed to split up the vote for the benefit of The Imperium. A member of the northern side of this war will change sides and help The Imperium. The unchecked proliferation of un-used citadels will continue to be zealously addressed by the real heroes of EvE Online. The Imperium.
---
All of this will happen and there isn't a damn thing any of you can do about it. Even if a small percentage of you are self aware enough to accept what is happening, it's already too late. The election is over and no amount of information control will halt the downfall of reddit voter turnout.
---
The past 3 years I have canvased here knowing full well that you would never willingly accept The Key~ to your shackles even if presented to you. The ultimate argument inoculation, the ultimate dead agenting of an enemy group. It's too late, there is nothing you can do. I have already won.
---
"The best"
---
True multi language support is seems as well hehe.
---
Made out of our enemies
---
I know keepstars are huge, but with the number of titans that can fit in a keepstar I'd imagine 99% of a keepstar is for housing supers in planck generators.
---
My 200km tengu sniper fit would disagree. At around 180km I have been able to pop MWDing frigs with rails more than once if I managed to kill them before they clear the bubble.
---
oh no, not your subs....
---
I'll take the bait. Spill your beans.
---
You can’t get a cap stable dual rep VNI without gimping the fit. Unless you mean losing the prop mod, in which case even dual rep isn’t going to be enough to keep you alive, the rats will kill you
---
Because it's a cool design and no one ever gets to see them.  Their either not used or cloaked.
---
I thought the alliance just dissolved. Not that they all quit.
---
Also that's one group, not plural.
---
Exactly this. He definitely follows Mittens around at conventions.
---
im asking the same question
---
This. Most PvE in EVE is horrible. The more i can do passivly, the better.
---
So, my pimped out Punisher won’t be able to do Triglavian PvE?
---
It’s a waste of time. But if it makes you happy then go for it, Dramiel is a cool ship
---
Naw. 3 of the 4 accounts are in groups as per the icons. That's the main launcher, not the setting menu for groups. Unsure if you're confused or goof'n
---
You won't believe what these guys had to do to be able to fit more ino their hangars!
---
:D more than anything this new content is logi training
---
Whow there...thought Goons said PanFam/NC. dont undock.
---
This.
---
Not to mention things like defense, infrastructure, transit, and all that hangar space.
---
Bad math is bad on bad assumptions.
---
You keep items outside of containers?
---
"They don't represent any real influence in the current inflation state." 
---
50% of the bounty faucet is made with carriers according to CCP ...
---
L5 missions and Incursions have rather big portion of their reward in LP, which is an isk sink, not a faucet.
---
It probably doesn't entirely even out the bounties.
---
But even assuming they rewarded ISK only, the total players doing those are a magnitude fewer than nullsec anomalie runners.      
---
And at least for incursions the number of players able to run them is somewhat capped.     
---
And if lvl 5 missions became that much more desireable suddenly, that might at least vitalize lowsec.
---
EVE is not easy, it has a steep learning curve and that's the beauty of the game. I wasn't talking about any changes in gameplay, just some improvement in the visual aspect of combat which falls quite short of modern standards. 
---
Show a typical eve pvp video to someone who has never seen eve and he'll get bored af. We make up for this by adding narration, background stories, and voice comms but the video by itself is totally uninteresting.
---
other groups have quit in the last 2 years.
---
you understand what was meant.
---
sometimes i use my old canadian passport to wipe my ass, makes my visas page look better
---
A friend of mine is suggesting I join his Corp, which I’d like to do, but he’s mentioned that I need to travel to where they are first before joining, so I don’t get killed. 
---
I’m wondering - if I join their Corp, can I still go back to Sehmy VII and do all the stuff I’ve been doing in my first two weeks of Eve (security missions and mine). Or, do I need to take all my stuff, including ships, with me when I join the Corp (which is in nullsec, btw)
---
Thanks for your help, y’all!
---
no, you deploy double the force needed to raise the bar for your enemy to contest you.
---
there is a very different mindset about fighting when you are in a proper war than when you want fun fleets and fights where the fight itself is the objective.
---
My sides :cripes:
---
I kind of worked around that Issue, see my edits.
---
If moderation would like, you could alter the title to something like "fixed - kind of.."
---
thanks again!
---
1000 unique item stacks
---
You re elite sweetie.
---
Fit please. Are you shooting lasers and sentries from over a 100km?
---
Same reaction here! lol
---
I mean maybe if you fit overdrives.
---
Also assuming 100k+ drone control range and you are aligning to the opposite side of a site, you are well past the time it should take to kill the site.
---
An hour may be a bit of an exaggeration.
---
Congratulations
---
Lol I think goon high command and Aryth have more pressing matters to worry about
---
It's not like the domi's will be orbiting the havens, just stay pre-aligned to a citadel and align to the next anom when you finishing off the last wave. Plus they fit a mjd making them all the more difficult to catch.
---
I have the same issue.  Zkillboard's autocomplete seems to be buggy.
---
You can never have enough Logi training.
---
Wingspan is the only torpedo delivery service I trust.
---
you forgot to mention BOT, who is the cup that they toss up
---
I think the limit should be raised to at least 10 mil
---
Now now... Just imagine if CCP is planning to have a Triglavian invasions in Jita of all places! LOL
---
Now, just imagine for a moment that they actually plan to have a major event around it where the Triglavians wanting to do on us a killing blow go straight to the hub station and fucking kill it! 
---
The sheer amount of salt... The hate would be paupable!
---
Ill second this. Flying tackle, bubble, or scout is a ton of fun. Ive been playing since 2009 and I still prefer this play style.
---
Newbies don’t instawarp upon seeing a name pop up in local.   They usually take a few seconds to recognize the change, pull drones and warp to their citadel.
---
Maybe you should go listen to the interviews.
---
Different candidates spoke about their areas of expertise and how they would be able to bring their knowledge to the CSM
---
We're all surprised by this turn of events.
---
You have a much better tank and can fit a Cyno without any compromises.
---
Assuming you don't just warp off when neuts enter system, you're better equipped to murder a lone tackle or survive until help arrives while you light the Bat Signal.
---
I feel like the Killing of a ratting ship has its rewards, however in a small gang setting the response to having that ship tackled and the locals trying to fight back is what is desired from a small gang group. in my opinion VNI kills are just Meh...
---
I agree with everything but the resin part.  Resin is shit.
---
Yes they did, we anchored them in Saranen while we were there completely voluntarily.
---
who
---
u mean fly with volta und bb flag
---
&gt;no u
---
It's kind of a foregone conclusion now, but my thought was more so actions speak louder than words. 
---
Dunk runs a huge null blob corps, that's what he's about. There's nothing wrong with that, it's a sandbox game - but it won't get my vote no matter what he might say.
---
Switch to a gla or Ishtar, problem solved.
---
and cat ears.
---
skillu directors sold the renter alliance
---
&gt;some of the big groups like Karmafleet ..... have approximately no input screening.
---
just LOL.
---
You don't think he'd be in horde, test or frat  space if any of those entities played like goons?
---
Well this was before we had small/med rigs, so you had to use large rigs on any hull. Due to large rigs being pricey almost no one rigged their ships.
---
I forget which ship I ran then, it was either a small gun dual rep Myrm or the Harbi but 25 mil was a lot to me then.
---
Hopefully corrected now.
---
I disagree with this. They are DRONES. They are meant to either auto aggression or be passive.  This should not be changed.
---
ah thx
---
&gt; Also, 90 bil is a lot to some people,
---
so don't fly what you can't afford to replace.
---
Make it an ion fan for extra coolness (and energy inefficiency, fuck that shit)
---
Running out of time, tank seems fine.  I've noticed I'm missing a few missile skills on that alt, I'm training them now.
---
They made a goddamn video about it.
---
Check the current list of starting skills and compare it to what you have, if there's a bunch of stuff at 3-4 that you don't even have at one, particularly fitting skills it might be better to restart with the referral bonus and such.
---
shart dragon
---
People will adapt faster than the bots, simply getting them to land on a bubble is the hard part.
---
You can relearn the game without wasting a month of training, you will be majorly handicapping yourself.
---
Only if he's not missing a bunch of level 3-4 fitting skills that you start with now, that's a month of training right there probably.
---
yes I noticed this too, you used to be able to in the past
---
So much this.
---
Evejobs for recruitment
---
CCP reduced the VNI's drone bandwidth. It can no longer use 5 heavies.
---
Because everyone believes you're a day 1 player that spent a bunch of money injecting in to a well knowing botting/afk site running ship ....... Nice try.
---
New players cannot afford the 1 billion isk for skill injectors. It's months before a new player makes their first billion.
---
Because you're a prime target for them in a hecate.
---
Imagine getting flair-baited that hard in 2k19
---
Yikes.
---
You should go listen to his interview.
---
I’ve met him in game several times throughout my Eve career and he’s a pretty knowledgeable and chill guy.
---
I’m personally happy that he’s on the CSM, because I know he’ll represent our player base well.
---
And do keep in mind that not everyone starts the game and skips straight to nullsec. I started in high, went to low, and then eventually went to null.
---
Hey any chance of getting advanced search of some sort in the future? Would love to be able to search by like X ship in X location in the last X weeks.
---
New meta will be myrm, domi, gila, rattler. All with cynos fitted. Id put money on it. Gila maybe no cyno but the rest will if the pilot is smart. Its about time that abomination got nerfed into the ground. VNIs and gilas are to strong. Gilas you at least pay for the performance.
---
Yeah I'm sure he's a cool dude, just different playstyles is all. 
---
You convinced me, I'll listen to the damn interview haha.
---
Keepstars are packed to the brim with titans. No room for citizens.
---
&gt; you would want to get together 15 people to kill one proteus
---
That's how you deal with pirat. 
---
Give them a easy target that won't drop shit and then just deny them content with tornados. It's actually really satisfying to fleet warp, land in sync, and then ruin someone's day. 
---
&gt;that wasn't what you were implying
---
And that's exactly what I was implying earlier. At least to people who know what tornados are used for. "Nobody" actually sits and fights in them. It's always gate camps, structure camps, and warping in to blap one target and leave.
---
I would perceive that as a benefit. It doesn't scale as well with a lot of alts like so many things in this game do. If you want the SP you have to actually play on that character. Players in this game are so used to just grabbing another alt and the rewards instantly multiplying
---
Your welcome for that useful feature. I recommended it to one of the dudes that manages the launcher. It was fun troubleshooting the bugs it originally caused.
---
It evens the playing field so that players that only play with 1 account don't have to have a bunch of alts to maximize it. They get the maximum reward for the same amount of effort. If players that have 20 alts want it on every player then that's on them to get it. Why is everything HTFU except when they want to whine about it?
---
for the first one it feel like a "wormhole" or a gate you can enter abyssal fleet ? or maybe a new "triglavian region" ? would be interesting
---
How would i live without this kind of nerd stuff
---
&lt;3
---
Is that legal?
---
It's a bonus. If you miss a day then it's no different than what you're getting now
---
No? I don't think many people give fair fights, hence the 4v1. If you play EVE for 'fair' fights, I think you are playing the wrong game.
---
inb4 PLEX prices drop because less VNI bots
---
It has a steep learning curve for sure. Not sure how good that is neccesarily.
---
Visuals are nice. Problem is most people are zoomed out during combat and it's all missed
---
Also waiting for when ishtars become relevant again
---
I S H T A R S  P L S
---
How do? I’ve done some projects with my work’s resin printer and the resolution is great.
---
more dangerous eve for other people*  
---
most of the people screaming about how safe eve is for people flying caps/supers are the ones flying 50m isk ships with cloaks, living in an npc station that can never be destroyed
---
Be prepped for a rude awakening in the CSM room lol
---
I mean there can only be one Iron Armada.
---
Listen to the interviews for those who made it on.  I am personally very satisfied with the new CSM.
---
Make sure you're some distance from the site marker, pre align to a structure away from said marker, and when a red enters local hit your MJD and start acceleratin. If the red enters your site you'll just have to hit warp as you wave from a distance.
---
Dang, this almost makes me feel bad for killing stations.  I imagine that the population of at risk targets such as keepstars and other strategic stations would have a reduced population, though.
---
Sounds like maybe people need to get a fucking grip and not sperg out about trying to reward new players that probably play with a single account.  Just because it will take them forever to run missions on 20 alts to get all the SP and they'll fucking break down mentally if they don't do it doesn't mean it shouldn't be done to help new players get skilled in to ships faster. Small amounts of SP like that are vastly more useful for new players training in to lower level skills than 100 mil SP players anyways.
---
I'm aware, I'm just replying to your point about picking fights.
---
Exactly. It's going to make way more difference to a new player than an older player, but they're still bitching about having to log in their 20 alts because they don't want to miss out on any SP. It's really fucking sad and just shows why this community is shit.
---
There are many, many ships that can run anoms without coming close to dieing. The point of the VNI is that it can run it fully AFK, and that's only possible with drones. So any replacement will have to be a drone boat. There are still fits possible for an AFK drone boat, but I don't believe one with the same effectiveness and cost/yield ratio as the VNI.
---
Not sure, I mostly fly assfrigs and covops, but simulation tells me the standard t2 fleet cane is 75m right now.
---
They put it into a 20,000 m3 container to prevent an frigate from scooping it up. All it has in the container is the BPC.
---
Brutal. Love it.
---
Chance, yes. 
---
Doing it? Search is hard, so maybe.
---
I already knew the context from talking with some havoc peeps on discord after his last post so it was a lot easier to figure it out.
---
Cool, just thought I'd ask, you guys do great work as is, keep it up 🙂
---
I'm guessing this will be for new players only.
---
Eve has always made itself special by its risk. The more you take risk out of the game, the closer the game actually becomes the "excel in space" it is often made out to be by those that don't play it.
---
i am going to trust a little in the community and think that most alliances with botters dont actually know they are botters,
---
Oh you mean actually people will be escalating fights now? Sounds fun to me.
---
I would make a new one and go through the tutorials and career agents.
---
Ah, I found the guy that never used a micro jump drive to moonwalk out ratting battleship 😀
---
So you are saying you want CCP to the game easy for to kill ratter?
---
it looks like it has to , because the space is a rough and dangerous place)
---
Nope. You will see more active armor tanked VNIs with 4 damage mods using the mixed drone set up (2 heavies, 2 mediums, 1 light) still afking like crazy.
---
Afk ratters want the cheap afk part and don't care as much about ticks.
---
Dumbest post of 2019 right here, jesus christ.
---
Patterns of player action should raise  a suspect flag... People who get suspect flags should have a simple puzzle/captcha type interaction thrown at them. Fail the captcha or not even attempt it and ship speed is dropped to zero. To allow ship to accelerate again player must interact with a randomly generated button.
---
Bots will die, players will be able to carry on almost uninhibited.
---
This is just one of many solutions that are possible, we just need the smart people at CCP to actually try implementing something and tweaking it.
---
Botbrain.
---
And we would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids.
---
Meh no surprise here... 
---
Same collection of corps and alliances... 
---
This will NOT change the game for the better. In fact it is almost a pointless $ sink on CCP's part.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*

Damn! Almost got away with it all but this shining beacon of light and justice decided to post all the evidence to reddit.
---
I’ve worked with and painted thousands of models.  Metal, various resins and plastic.  From a painting perspective, over time resin models are likely to have paint flake off.  
---
They are also more susceptible to temperature changes - ie: being in a warm car for transport or left in a non-temperature controller setting.  
---
From a pure durability setting they are more likely to have small parts break off.  Also if you need to file parts I hope you have a well ventilated area along with a mask.  
---
At this point I refuse to work with it regardless of vendor.
---
I only mentioned like 1/100000 of all the jobs that would be required to keep a station like this operational. Were probobly talking a skeleton crew of tens of billions. And full capacity at 300b.
---
Throwback to the time LUMIO EN TILAVINE solo bashed citadels in gallente drone ships which were not a VNI
---
Nah
---
Personally I believe bots are easily detected and CCP will seldomly come out with new ban numbers to show they are doing something, but truth is bots are easily remade and back out in space doing their thing. 
---
I'm sorry but the only way to prevent this is to install in-game mechanics that can only be done but a human. Figure that out and game over for bots.

Not bad, could have sanded it a bit more but still very nice, have an updoot

I’ve run into this problem once, when handling eviction loot at over 1000 different stacks. Could not repackage items or repair them until I had split my loot across multiple characters, and once that was done I had roughly 600 stacks that I could move and manage.
---
Yeah. If they really wanted to keep it somewhat like it is, just have it go to 0 in hisec, but let it stay at 10km in low/null.
---
I think you need a mii character to use the miiverse
---
if alliance are to bad to taxe they're miner in one or other way. Maybe it'sz leadership alliance level problem.

Start again, now you get a lot of new skills and the tutorial is alright, you won't be losing much tbh.

It's better for the small guy who's only been playing a year or two with one or two accounts.

Sion had some IRL problems when it came to ego and video games, but I'm sure you know about it well enough.
---
Now how about adding bookmarks to overview?  I would like to not fumble around trying to right click in space to use my bookmarks please.
---
Not necessarily true. People (myself included) had a lot of fun playing DayZ and the like when there was no mechanical safety; the safest thing you could do was put your stuff in a tent somewhere and hope nobody found it. If they did, oh well.
---
Many survival games like Rust still have that aspect - your base got raided while you weren't online? Oh well. RIP.
---
That's fun to a lot of people, and adding mechanical safety - like asset safety - can take away from the experience. It'd be really disappointing to, say, forcefully dismantle a Rust base and then not get the targets' stuff. It'd also lose its sense of risk for the defenders - there wouldn't be any real consequences to losing other than having to move and rebuild the base. You'd still have your material progress.
---
I don't actually know how asset safety works in EVE - won EVE for a bit, missed that update - but it sounds like something like that.
---
I don't know very many people that roll around with +5s in their head unless they're just parked in a station training, so I guess those people are falling behind and they should be up in arms about it
---
That has almost nothing to do with your claim. 
---
Yes people are leaving.  No there are not coordinated walkouts.
---
Except that bps list how many units of minerals you need not the m3.  But since this is spreadsheets in space, I have a sheet that tells me how many units of each mineral I get based on my personal yield rates.  
---
But it’s still my go to website for info
---
Living in the hole you intend to run sites in works for a low effort lifestyle, but those sites don't spawn that quickly. I would probably set up in a C2 (C3/HS), you get the same HS exit and you can roll the C3 until you find one you like. Rolling C2-C3 holes is quick with two characters; rolling C3-HS ones is not.
---
10 bit integer.

You want me to thank you for something you didn’t do, and I didn’t ask you to do, or not do it anyway ?

People are weird.

Galaxy brain stuff right there.

You can't really slingshot out of a Garmur's point if the Garmur pilot doesn't make a mistake.
---
Look at the market price of compressed to uncompressed.   It doesn’t cost anything to compress and usually is slight more isk when sold.  Not always though so check your markets or evemarketer
---
Have you run the damage numbers on that cause I have and even with 6 damage mods, perfect skills, and the drone mix you listed you can't top 600dps and that requires augmented gallente drones. T2 gallente drones get you 543dps.
---
Time to add this to the list. You know the one.
---
VNI nerfed(?)
---
75 Drone Bandwidth now instead of 125 (3 ~~5~~ Heavies)

But they buffed some other stuff to keep it viable for pvp maybe

---
To use google to search for a page on a specific website, include site:address in your search criteria. For example:
---
site:zkillboard.com gnosis ship
---
Are you using minmitar drones?
---
suitonia anyone JFing VNIs was doing it wrong.  You can fit 100+ VNI bpcs in a travel ceptor or the same JF with other big things and use local minerals.
---
The VNI will be able to field 3 heavy drones.
---
Damn son, you made an account just to post this moronic shit? That's a whole new level of stupid right there.
---
You also can't extract alpha skills...
---
your idea was launched :D
---
ONLY FOUR?
---
Fun fact: robots are better at CAPTCHAs than humans are.
---
proudly super casual
---
&gt; That was pretty far from an actual fight.
---
&gt;If you play EVE for 'fair' fights, I think you are playing the wrong game.
---
Alright.
---
fit a cyno, pack some drugs and drop your standing fleet onto whatever catches you, Domi is and has been for some time better than the VNI
---
You're not *wrong*, but... Why would this even need  to be a thing? CCP needs to look at what made people play it back in 2004 and what made them play in 2011-2014. And what caused the big drop afterwards.
---
(since ccp can't possibly know this, i'll tell you boys - get rid of the upwell garbage, reintroduce starbase-mechanics, make territorial conquest necessary again and, for real this time, make moving capital ships a goddamn hassle so that you can't traverse the goddamn galaxy with your 500 titans at the click of a button)

---
Sion almost single handedly ruined my time on CSM near the end there.
---
I think you're missing the point. It's not that FW players fly the VNI, but that they buy VNI BPCs with Gallente LP.
---
Reason number 8 is the real shocker.
---
Null-blocs really value new players, both for immediate benefit and the long term gain. New players are the lifeblood of all the null-blocs, and they know it. Null-blocs are the best choice for any new player; excellent tutoring and multiple excellent low sp sources of income that fits any playstyle and rl-schedule. That is why people keep recommending it.
---
It wont fix nothing. 
---
You still can use ishtar gila arma domi for drone ratting afk.
---
Why the hell afk ratting is bad? Pve in this game is just horrible... i totally understand as i do afk ratting and mining myself.
---
Making isk in this game is just so boring, this need to change before nerfing a ship. 
---
Also vni was a good pvp Cr.
---
CCP please hire
---
I imagine the central section is mostly given over to docking and related ship services, and then the two giant towers either side are for habitation and living and all the amenities that go with that.
---
That was awesome.  Still laughing.
---
Here's what we do...
---
- Triglavians need to go and Invade the big boys space. They need to wreck house with big angry wandering fleets, trashing Capitals and Citadels left and right. Sure, the big boys will be able to fend them off for a time, seeing as they have THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS of Capitals to spare. But they will eventually get worn down.
---
- At the same time, we need to completely revamp things like Mining and Incursions and stuff like that. We need to completely RUIN any chance of successfully running bots and farming your way into wealth.
---
- - Get rid of Excavators for the Rorq, and put it back to being a big fat Foreman ship that compresses stuff, instead of a solo AFK mining machine. Or seeing as we have other Foreman ships, and Citadels can do Compression... scrap the Rorqs altogether. They're obsolete, just like POS.
---
- - Start adding in AOE shrapnel damage to more rocks besides Mercoxit. That way people who rely solely on Mining Drones... can't anymore. No more AFK Orcas either.
---
- - Start adding stupid little minigames to all these monotonous activities. Like having to manipulate mining laser frequencies to make sure you extract the minerals from the ore, instead of just filling your hold with useless rock debris. Or having to surf a Hacking-ish maze in order to find the minerals hidden among the useless rock.
---
Just with these couple steps, we could seriously weed out all the economic bloat that is driving inflation to ridiculous levels. There used to be a time when seeing (A) Capital ship was an impressive sight. When they were compared to the Death Star, a legendary weapon of galactic destruction. Now we've got thousands hanging out in a fleet just bumping into each other. The Empire has replaced all those TIE Fighters and Speeder Bikes, and now everyone gets their own Death Star.
---
If we cut down on the whaling, then when a shiny new T2 frigate hits the market, it won't start out at 100 Billion ISK and people still buy them just to say they were the first.
---
I seem to remember them flip flopping on that one as individual devs called it different ways before the official listing as an exploit.
---
How long does it take for an alpha to hit the 5 million skillpoints cap?
---
Walking in stations!
---
Do you inject them in your ass muscles like steroids or do you vein them like a junkie? Which gets you peak SP? Asking for frenz....
---
Maybe fly with bombers bar if you want your fleet mates to follow you back to your wormhole and try to evict you. I'm only speaking from experience no big deal.
---
Or being able to sort by range with either optimal or falloff distance
---
I like that we're a small carebear indy corp with friendly fire enabled. Well, for now anyways.
---
Every time we get bored, off we go to shoot at stuff and other players. Or if someone goes afk on Sunday a.m. mining ops I can just shoot them instead of being like "dude are you still there?" every 10 mins on discord.
---
Welcome to Eve! It is very recommended that you join a corp since the game is, at it's core, a social game. Depending on how big his corp is, you can probably leave your ships in hisec and just go to nullsec. Corps that focus on newbros often just give out ships and skillbooks since what you are flying early on is actually very cheap to a veteran player. 
---
Also, while security missions and mining can be fun early on, it is more profitable to do it in nullsec, so it's probably a good move to exit hisec. Don't hesitate to eventually try out other spaces too (lowsec and wh)!
---
The sheer amount of player wrecks and loots!! Mmmm I'm down
---
And then everyone will be expected to have something else. Removing skills isn't a good way to go. Part of skilling up is the time you spend learning the game.
---
yeah dude barra rmt'd so much he got bored of rmt'ing and quit xd
---
Thats not how this works. Without those skills literally no ship is where it needs to be. They are fundamental skills absolutely required to be able to pilot a ship at a functional level.
---
There are *zero* other skills that have that effect on every single ship, thats why we dont have a magic 20 or magic 50.
---
You say, 
---
&gt;We need to completely RUIN any chance of successfully running bots and farming your way into wealth.
---
Then you give suggestions that would do absolutely nothing to stop that, Its like you don't even know explo is botted let alone barge mining.
---
&gt; Just with these couple steps
---
We could achieve nothing, YAY \o/.
---
&gt;No there are not coordinated walkouts.
---
i guess you're already forgetting what happened 4 posts ago
---
i'm done responding to your stupidity
---
Umm, what?
---
If you have to play a minigame while you're mining, or else your ship just fills up with useless rock... How would you bot that?
---
If you can't just send out Mining Drones and let them chew away at the asteroids, b/c the rock fragments will kill them before they get a full load ready to deliver... How would you bot that?
---
&gt; How would you bot that?
---
The same way you bot explo or anything else? You get it to read whats on the screen/in the logs and input changes appropriately?
---
Are you confusing bots with basic macros?
---
Show me some Project Discovery bots, or some Hacking maze bots...
---
It wasn't an actual fight and I didn't expect it to be.
---
We usually just self destruct. Never thought to panic. Will try next time!
---
👍
---
Congrats...i know ive posted that you will break NDA affer being locked in with all the gsf guys but i hope you can bring back content with just a few against super umbrellas
---
Make dread bombs great again.
---
6 months
---
The leadership not wanting to continue != coordinated walkout.
---
But ok same.
---
Steam has only benefits to it, please prove me wrong
---
It can, if you team up with two more friends in frigates!
---
eviction loot is a fucking nightmare
---
I'm certain you're confusing bots with simple macros now.
---
https://github.com/mjfinzel/HPA-Project-Discovery-Bot
---
I'm not linking you to explo and wormhole bots as those are in more dodgy places and would probably get me a ban for linking but you are allowed to use google yourself.
---
To actually answer your question: the reason they want you to get out of HS before joining their corp is most likely because they are war-decced. That means some other corp has declared war on them and they can legally shoot each other in HS. So if you join immediately, there will be other HS players that can shoot at you, and your new corp can't help you or protect you from all the way in nullsec. 
---
So while you can still do HS activities after joining, you might run into your enemies and HS and get shot. So if you insist on doing that, make sure to stay out of highly populated hubs like Jita or Amarr, instead try to find some quiet pocket where you can do your stuff in peace. But I agree with the other dude, you won't have a lot of reason to come back to HS once you join them.
---
You only Light a cyno if Support like a Fax jumps to you.

&gt;Search is hard
---
Preach. How is the current search implemented, if you don't mind sharing?
---
Using Redis. An update a week ago screwed up the redis search so I had to rewrite it a bit which was causing some of the latest search issues.
---
Yes, there are better methods but they aren't simple nor quick to implement. :(
---
But if it does, it'll be that much more impressive
---
pity you can't do some real mind trading
---
Unless you have support ready the second you light the cyno, you'll be dead before it gets there, even if there's just an assfrig attacking you
---
Amazing. Thanks
---
What is an actual fight then? You might be playing the wrong game.
---
I'm all for eliminating bots, but we should leave afk ratters / afk loot/content alone. Removing drone auto aggress will be a minor nuisance for regular players. Bots will simply script drone aggression and keep hitting.

i need a 3d printer......

Sell u mine for $800

Does that include the 750k skillpoints when using an invite link?
---
No, go away.

Why is his face red like he's been exposed to 3.6 roentgens
---
We are doomed!
---
while on the subject of docking, and as you are new: select your favorites stations, double clic in space in its direction to "hug it" , you shall be inside the ring of lights surrounding it. Then create a bookmark there. Whenever you want to dock t the station, warp to the bookmark instead and then dock. Boum, you just made and instadock bookmark
---
The reason is, if you warp to the station directly, you may not land on docking range, and so are vulnerable while approching it. So warp to uour bookmark instead
---
Yeah cut the bandwidth but buffed the pg/cpu, added a 3rd hardpoint, reduced mass, buffed align, replaced the hull bonuses with the combined bonuses of both the Brutix and Myrmidon but with the addition of 10% tracking per level on both the drones and medium hybrids.
---
If he does are you going to scream at him and tell him he's literally the cancer rotting the game?
---
yes please
---
&gt; There wasn't really much TIDI. 
---
aye lmao I hit tidi 7 jumps out when I was burning there
---
you said coordinated walk out, not me
---
but your stream is offline.
---
Ofcourse. Never Light the cyno befor your fleet is rdy.
---
The much harder Part is to slow down to Light the cyno and dont die
---
Hey man, he wrote 52 pages of nullsec theory and presented it to CCP. He's clearly **very** important!
---
They might at some point
---
That's pretty damn cool
---
Mooring was the original intent anyway.
---
I'm not saying that caps and supers don't have balance issues that need to be addressed. I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy of people, including olmeca, claiming that eve needs to be more dangerous, while doing the least dangerous things in the game with the most inexpensive ships in the game.
---
Fleet took the bait and got roughed up so everyone is reshaping and such
---
why do you assume he's talking about aryth? there's been plenty of goons to choose from in the csm mate
---
I'm flexible, for the right amount of money i'll scream just about anything you want at you.
---
Yeah he lives on a yacht now
---
Combat interceptors are no longer nullified.
---
A friend of mine was developing a game and a few of us joined in to help. It was a pretty cool procedurally generated sci fi world so I went and scraped the scripts for every star trek TOS and TNG episode and fed them into a bunch of markov bots and created the longest running star trek episode ever. It ran for a few years and it was fascinating to watch if you were a bit wrong, otherwise it made no sense. When players pissed me off I would teleport them into the star trek studio room and watch them go insane.
---
I also created a bucket of shit to put annoying players in. It was basically a bucket of shit and it said "you are in a bucket of shit" if you did anything at all. The bucket of shit that sat on the floor of my ship and did nothing was better than all of the stupid amateur game dev threads on here.
---
I just returned after a break and was wondering if the Epic Arcs are still repeatable. I was going to do the SoE arc and the agent says "I would like to remind you that you have previously completed this epic arc and for you to embark on it once again I would have to erase all memory of the arc from your mind. Are you sure you would like to start this journey once again and lose all history of this arc?"
---
Does this just reset the arc or does it drop faction gains etc from previous completions? The wording just seems shady as fuck.
---
&gt; He won't change the status quo...
---
...because making their own changes is not what CSM can realistically do, being honest.
---
Not talking CCP out of something that will bring benefits to some party is something CSM definitely can do.
---
Would you say that a 4v1 structure bash was an actual fight? Not that I'm complaining, both sides said they had fun and it's exactly what I was expecting.
---
is it more dangerous to your ship to roam around in hostile space and kick the hornet's nest, or is it more dangerous to use an expensive loot pinata to gather more resources but have a full response at your back in case things go wrong?
---
danger is relative.
---
You can use http://mossworks.xyz/zkillsearch/
---
Probably not all you wanted but it's something.
---
Man that was a bit ago.
---
"Some large groups unitedly quit the game altogether" implies that. Don't be obtuse.
---
Actually, the "core" section houses supers and vessels of all sorts. This calculation assumes only the "spire" sections are used for habitation.
---
Mate why
---
That's what the other 40% of the space in the spires not given over to habitation is used for. ;)
---
Yeah, that's how I calculated it.
---
In TV it's not popularity that hurts scifi, it's costs. Special effects are expensive. High Fantasy has the same issues... save 6/8 seasons of one particular show that had a very conservative FX budget for the genre. 2 Actors talking on screen is much cheaper than dragons or spaceships flying around. This is slowly changing as FX gets better and cheaper, to the point audiences accept it even if it's not the best possible.   
---
When you look at the fan bases, spending, and target demos for advertisers.... we're not weird, we're just expensive.
---
MMOs and gaming in general the opposite... special effects are basically sunk costs and 2 actual actors voice acting a cut scene is insanely expensive in terms of development money and effort. Most space MMOs have failed because of cashflow and development troubles... but that's just as true for most MMOs and even most single-A gaming efforts (not AAA not Indie, CCP sized).   
---
No major publisher right now is backing MMOs beyond hedge investments, that's why they're all on kickstarter projects now. Much less one helmed by a burnout who was almost a decade removed from the industry, had never worked on an MMO, and failed to deliver on his last grand vision.
---
&gt;I also think you don't calculate how much of a Keepstar is given up to pure hangar space. You can dock a fleet of supercapitals in it after all ...
---
I do, actually. If you read the full post I assume that only the "spire" sections are given over to civilian habitation and that the "core" section is used for vessel docking and management.
---
I think you overestimate how long a shield VNI can survive
---
YW!
---
That idea just makes too much sense for CCP to do it. I'd love something like that, managing PI across 5 toons would be so much easier than it is.
---
That's a good assumption, though at the same time there's a Scope video which says that despite the dangers of citadel life tons of people leave planets to live in citadels because of the comparatively luxurious lifestyle.
---
Whatever arbitrary number CCP makes up. It's is a fucking video game.
---
In a 64-bit environment there should be no functional limits to the amount of stuff you can have in a hangar.
---
Floating on the tears of his enemies
---
things add up. Rigs, ships, ammo, loot, whatever random stuff they give away. Just dont sell things for a bit.
---
I've actually done the numbers and gotten a little over a trillion with modern experimental aeroponics, assuming everyone lives in arcologies with the density of Singapore and everyone eats nutrient paste. This also assumes we only use the land area of Earth, BTW.
---
So we definitely have room for a few more on the planet.
---
Yeh, bummer you didn't make it, I'm just surprised I made it till round 13....
---
See you on the ballot next time
---
-Zap
---
Isn't that what OP already said...
---
😏
---
*Wii Sports golf Woaaah Intensifies*
---
Speaking of trays, watch Star Wars Canteen
---
&gt;Even with very high density and every planet populated, operating one Keepstar only would drown the population of entire constellations if not regions.
---
Not necessarily true. There's a lot of habitable planets in New Eden and there's been a lot of time for population growth. Assuming a steady 1% population growth rate, just under our current world population growth rate, and that New Eden started with a population of \~100Mn \~2500 years ago (based off [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZPCiqBLPM8) which says that there were "thousands" of years between the EVE Gate collapse and the current time in New Eden), the population of New Eden would be \~635,966,817,964,860,000. That's over 2.3Mn Keepstars worth assuming the high estimate of Keepstar population, or over 6.4Mn Keepstars assuming the low estimate.
---
Space is big. Really big.
---
This is trash even by the incredibly low standards of goon shitposts.
---
Give it up dude. Your make-believe is not convincing anyone.
---
1: Planck generators
---
2: If you actually read my post you'd understand that the assumption used in this model was that the "core" section of the Keepstar was used for docking and support facilities with only the comparatively small "spire" sections used for habitation.
---
Not to mention that it's likely most if not all of the population is evacuated during the period of the hull timer, when it's clear the station is likely to fall.
---
Evacuating 98+Bn people in a few days is a herculean task, to be sure, but likely relatively achievable given the state of EVE tech. It's likely some of those billions could hitch a ride on Capsuleer vessels evacuating items from the station.
---
Yeah, but it bears repeating because a surprising number of people didn't get it.
---
Well, I'd be more than happy to see your numbers. ;)
---
I lost my Eagle in high sec after tring to shoot a NCDOT scout. My fleetmate laughed at me quite a bit.
---
He pvps spaceships to death before convoing an fc and telling them ferox numbers. Not cool.
---
Oh on the way there tidi was pretty hilarious. i was talking about the fight itself in system. I should have clarified.
---
Lol...high sec is scary.
---
Those 2bil+ every month will eat away at your fun in no time flat. Approach this as a subscription game, at least for a year.
---
Extract 10m sp and sell it
---
It's the button you push when you're tired of carrier ratting and just want somebody to put you out of your misery.
---
I agree. But maybe I'm an optimist that thinks discussion improves general understanding of the game. And that 1 good suggestion is worth going through 100 terrible ones.
---
Yep this is probably the best one, spend under 1b for 2 extractors and get over 2b back in the injectors.
---
Also increase corp hangars.
---
Burma-shave!
---
Or just sell stuff. I never run close to that. Ammo, drone stacks, minerals, ore, junk mods turn to minerals
---
And a "switch character" option next to "log out".
---
To be fair, if you're running into the limit you're probably already using station containers to organise it.
---
Also personal hangar sections that you can share between characters with custom access lists.
---
I more curious how many people are going to die to a new VNI baiting in a sanctum.
---
Olmeca, is that you?
---
I feel like that's a compliment.
---
Either extract or use her as an alt.
---
Its nice to see people having fun :)  
---
Keep up the good fighting!
---
\*its not real\* hahhaa haa?
---
Oh boy do i know the feeling.
---
Here is your happy story.
---
It was a dark and gloomy wormhole entrance and while i was cloaked a uncloaked Proteus  was pretending to be afk. I took a swig of what ever Minmatar moonshine i bought in Hek and decided to take the bait after i made sure my alt and buddy were close.
---
I uncloak my mighty stratios and go to town on the proteus, and promptly i am scrammed, neuted the works.
---
*Aha i say! i knew you were a trap and i uncloak my alt!*
---
***The proteus pilot also uncloaks his alt.***
---
*Of course i planned for such a thing and counter with my friend*
---
You get the point, we counter-counter each other three times until we reach a stalemate because we have to little dps and to much reps.
---
Negotiations ensue.. and its relatively ok we are 45 minutes casually switching damage and trying to jam the other in a vain effort to make some head way. 
---
Until we see a Vargur on scan... and both parties say something like ''gg you won''. Clearly its a third party and we decided to gang together to what became a quite fun fight.
---
We ended up friends and flew together until i won eve and then the other guy as well. Still miss the dude sometimes.
---
 The best friendships are made at scram point.
---
Damn I could make several billion from that. Thanks!
---
SergalJerk is still a thing?
---
Isn't that that furry corp?
---
Looking into this whole thematic again I come to the conclusion that I was terribly lazy back then and just rolled with phased plasm cause I didn't want to jeopardize my chances of survival with all the odd fits in FW, and decided to fight with a slight handicap against everything. 
---
Not sure if retarded or genius.
---
So only a bit under ½ of EVE actives.
---
Haha nope
---
Yeah, I thought that was weird. So many people in the comments talking about how you didn't account for docking area and infrastructure when you stated it pretty clearly in you post that you assumed the core was all of that.
---
&gt;Terra
---
Maybe that's the secret of the Drifters...
---
Well, this certainly *looks* like English.
---
I sense a salty Russkie.
---
False.
---
Glad Olmeca made it, gratz dude!
---
I use Evanova Android.
---
I don't care about Reddit points.
---
I wouldn't call small scale pvp in Delve "the least dangerous thing in the game"... but then again, I'm not an idiot v0v
---
I did what I was supposed too and to great effect. The CSM was reformed by my graceful palms. Now it's time for an /r/eve reformation!
---
Nope.  Sorry, that's just xenuria.
---
yes, and it matters a lot when yo do  invention.
---
Use that character as an alt. Being Caldari having a Stork or Flycatcher will be handy, or having that character fly a Buzzard if you're a wormhole dweller/diver. 15m SP is pretty legit, I would keep that character, and worst case scenario you can always just train some PI skills or something passive and just keep that toon on the backburner, and say in the future you want to set up a character for something, well badabing badaboom, you've got one.
---
At least 7.
---
You and your friends aren't going to do a god damn thing, because all of you are too chicken shit to put your dicks on the table. Your leadership gets piss shivers every time Mittani so much as coughs. You can't wrap your mind around the fact that goons are doing this game a great service and an even greater one to NCPL by finger banging their reset button.
---
Gecko's are bitches...
---
Money can be exchanged for goods and services!
---
I was living in citadels in jspace during wwb..
---
Reddit puts Olmeca on the CSM with the hopes that he will be something other than an embarrassment. The scandals that surface involving gobbins and olmeca will further deincentivise the /r/eve crowd from participation in CSM. Reddit voter turnout will see an all time low, paving the way for an even more powerful GoonSwarm voting bloc. This will have ripple effects causing a sharp drop in viable non-bloc candidates and a sharp increase in NPC candidates designed to split up the vote for the benefit of The Imperium. A member of the northern side of this war will change sides and help The Imperium. The unchecked proliferation of un-used citadels will continue to be zealously addressed by the real heroes of EvE Online. The Imperium.
---
Oh totally. But having to keep putting stuff in cans to repackage mods, or pulling stuff out to use multifit is a pita.
---
If you look at who is on it is 3 from the Imperium, which is the same for the last few years.  It is about what we can get  on with single transferrable.  So on or off our ballot he got on through his hard work.  Reddit doesnt get credit for getting him on, he does.  Congrats for him he deserves it, while I dont agree with a lot of his opinions varied opinions are valuable.
---
Yeah, this card game honestly sparked my interest in the game. GenCon was giving away swag bags and each one had like a starter and a booster. Which gave 30 day codes. My GF at the time went with me and snagged maybe 30-40 of these boosters and starters.
---
I still have all these cards somewhere.
---
i just checked and mines doing the same thing.
---
add the popups when you hover over skills or skillbooks to that also
---
I'll take that bet.
---
RemindMe! 10 months "collect free isk"
---
My client is way less stable than it was 3 months or a year ago. At times unplayable
---
Just check the raptors in-game description
---
It's the launcher doing it. It seems to CPU spike whenever information changes on it since it's browser based and pulls in data from CCP to display in browser readable format.
---
You probably want to use a retribution instead of a punisher but it can do them
---
I'm pleased you got there.
---
Although, I don't agree with some of the things you say. I do think you'll make an active effort in trying to change the game for the better. 
---
However, the goon hubris has to stop as you are part of a team

Unless you're part of a major null bloc. In which case, you play awox/boot roulette.
---
We argued in your original AMA about what issues J space had and I believe in you man. Just please talk with J space corps. Get with comp, get with tiny, get with brax, get with the ehfkae leadership. We're a small community so it's possible. 
---
Ask us what we need and bounce your own ideas off of us. We're totally down to help.
---
each stack is also limited to 2^32 - 1.  (slightly over 2 billion units.)
---
I messed up and said client, not launcher. Made a new post.
---
All you need is about 350 dps to break npc battleships. At around 450 you can still get decent 14 to 16 mil isk per tick
---
Dps doesn't matter on an afk drone ratter. Cheapness and afkability does.
---
Not sure why you're trashing on Evictus. I can apply to test tomorrow and join, while the opposite isn't necessary true.
---
Smaller doesn't and will never mean less interesting
---
Ive used EvePanda and Eve Droid, also the CCP app over my time
---
The launcher is essentially a browser, which setting by default has hardware acceleration disabled so it will use CPU.
---
It spikes CPU everytime something changes as it pulls data from CCP in browser readable format and displays it (which causes CPU spike from rending it).
---
I just set the launcher to Low priority after I open EVE. Another option could be to enable hardware acceleration from the settings.
---
Get ready for the training wheels so you learn what CSM is really is then your interview
---
Same, can recomend it.
---
A Mexican standoff in space! I love it!
---
How would i go about catching tech 2 haulers in nullsec? i see them flying around a lot but I'm not sure what the usual tactic is for catching them.
---
[Average EVE player taking on a newbro apprentice](https://i.imgur.com/1MS3rbY.jpg)
---
[Globby taking on a newbro apprentice](https://imgur.com/gallery/CrNA0tr)
---
Instead you should join a tiny dead end lowsec corp and get curb stomped by bigger groups until you quit!
---
Enabling hardware acceleration seems to have fix it, now my gpu spikes up instead which is much better. Its still strange to me that it pulls data so frequently and has to re-render every time, even if there's no change... But who knows
---
My step dad and me would play th3 card game for hrs. Must have bought 10 boxes back in the day. Had wished they kept it going.
---
Nice meme.
---
It seems to be the first box to the right of the account list that switches between different items and has like 4-5 items it goes through in a repeating loop.
---
I wish there was an option to disable it from auto switching constantly...could help stop the spikes.
---
Ewww mac
---
Ooo that's prettiful
---
1) I'll work closely with Exookiz. S any worked-out idea you relay to him on the table will have my support and be on my agenda as well. I imagine he'll do the same when we go for proposals to make null more dangerous. We'll have to work together anyway on proposals like few shattered wormholes with heavy capital access (30m) in and out of null.
---
2) My discord will have a wormhole section if you want to relay ideas directly to me.
---
3) If wh opinion leaders have an uncluttered channel for discussion I'm willing to join and follow. Just invite.
---
I hope that's not a picture of him. You could land an erebus on that shit
---
Most eve thing ever
---
Oh you're totally right! A simple "Low Performance Mode" option in settings to disable the fancy transition would be nice, but whatever
---
The fact that multifit doesn't include items in containers is the biggest BS.
---
TLDR - Imps brought in long range cruisers only to figure out they couldn't stand toe to toe with long range BS. Finally figured out how to use transversal. 
---
Init Cynoed in 35 dreads to blap 7 caps
---
Not to mention all the crew on supers and Titans that need a place to stay when it's docked.
---
Would probably take CCP like 4 years to implement it. :^)
---
...couldn't it just pull all the slides once on initial launcher start and then just cycle through them automatically?
---
I think you have wrong ideas about what the CSM does. Voting, for one thing.
---
It does, but if you don't enable hardware rendering in the settings, it uses your CPU to render the fading transition between the 2 images. That task is much better suited for your GPU. That's whats spiking the CPU. If it just instantly switched between the two images it would take next to no CPU.
---
Admittedly, the system is heavily biased toward people who vote over the whine on Reddit demographics.
---
I use Neocom II, and highly recommend it. You can’t affect much of the game from the app other than saving fits and sending eve mails, but it tracks basically everything that you have going on in game
---
Growing tired of 4 pages suggestion posts. Keep your fantasies to yourself.
---
"Hey there newbro, I see you barely just finished the default lvl 1 agents, wanna join a friendly corp?"
---
Shortly later...
---
"Hey we're doing a WH fleet, come along newbro, yeah sure you can bring that shiny new shit fit T1 cruiser it'll be fun"
---
30 minutes later 
---
"You're in your pod an lost in WH space? It's cool just go back to station, reship, and come find us again"

That's how I won EVE as a noob a few years back. It was an interesting week.

You're making shit up and making yourself look silly.

You were first on my vote list. Followed by other small gang and wormhole people. I did not vote what my alliance was telling me I should vote on because that's just stupid. 
---
People should vote for themselves and not follow some alliance bullshit.
---
*it must be entirely impossible.*
---
Yeah, we all fight zoomed out because that's the only way you can actually fight anything that can put up a challenge. We need more visuals while zoomed out, like overlays and augmented reality. Anything like a 'combat mode' which completely changes the UI and the ship HUD and looks cooler. 
---
You see, if we can stream/record an awesome combat sequence that looks meaningful and interactive then we'll be able to draw a huge crowd to eve.
---
I hope op gets podded
---
Once I had real income, I came back to try this game again knowing that I can skip endless hours of grinding by throwing a couple bucks in.
---
I injected SP for the essential PVP skills after spending some time actually doing some research, and I've had more fun on this sub than I ever had on all my previous ones combined.
---
But yeah, imagine spending a day's work on a char just to slowly grind back that investment over the next few weeks lmao
---
You’re welcome btw
---
Just launch eve and close he launcher....
---
I second this. Probably hands down best EVE app
---
You'll need dps, webs, a dictor, and a fast decloaking frigate.
---
The best would be a battlecruiser for dps, a daredevil for decloaking and webs, and any dictor. Have a scout, preferabley one blue to the hauler, figure out where it is going, and set up your group on the other side of a gate. When it jumps through, bubble immeadiately and keep bubbling. When it decloaks, have the daredevil approach it at max speed, and then when it cloaks the daredevil needs to keep going the same way to decloak it. As soon as its decloaked the daredevil needs to land scram and web, and the battlecruiser should kill it pretty quickly.
---
It's more and less.
---
If someone pre scanned your system then there isnt much you can do unless you're spamming dscan, but sometimes a fast tackler can get you. 
---
Otherwise it's decently safe because they have to probe you down and you'll 100% see that. If you have a mass of green sites you're also really safe outside of a lucky d scan. If there're only 3 or 4 sites and they're spread out then you're fucked.
---
I would really like this extended to all skills honestly. My biggest gripe with eve is having to afk for a month to do the next cool thing
---
TBF, I don't follow this closely anymore, but I remembered the original announcement being "We'll take anyone!"  Maybe I mixed it up with Horde at the start?

Didn't even check flair. Just smelled spodbrain.

This is absolutely hilarious
---
They roam around in polarized bombers, kill 1 target then bail when a fleet comes along and call themselves the best, meanwhile Imperium roam around in titans, lay waste to entire regions, never run away even from a fight they can't win and polarize entire gaming communities against them.

Those are just fact, though.

I'm sure there are some like that, but I find it hard to believe an average player that actually plays the game has problems earning billions after a month into the game. From personal experience in my first 3 months last year

ships are ammo. dont get to attached to them, they all will die eventually.

some of the best pvpers have hundreds if not thousands of ship losses

Skills are the money maker.

You mean Mar5hy's personal army? No, thanks.

Just curious. The goons mantra is to make the game as unfun as they can for their enemies. Why should the north fight goons if that's what they want. 
---
I realize there's a bunch of holes in that argument, but it's a genuine question.

I've never heard someone don't know what to do with an alt in EVE

You will lose hundreds! And have a blast while doing so!

Well it's fun because everyone on coms loses their shit if you actually find them content. I remember flying with some big null alliance back in like 2012 or 2013. Waz tackling in my rifter and got point long enough for the gang to catch up and a big fight was had. 
---
People cheered in coms, fight was finished, rifter died, and then tons of nerds sent me a few million isk. 
---
Knowing your personal impact on a fight is the reward.
---
A nestor microphone would be cool
---
if your ship is nullified (and not higgs rigged), nothing stops you
---
Minecraft, (vanilla at least, though there are multiplayer mods), is the same way, but there is a key element of the design to DayZ and the like that I think you might not be considering. While there is no mechanical safety of assets, nothing is that hard to get, and you can always try and raid someone else.  
---
In other words: easy come, easy go.
---
The problem with this design, is that the game is extremely shallow. 
---
Eve has a great deal of depth to it, and part of that depth is the slow accumulation of assets and wealth over a long period of time. Losing a week's worth of stuff because you got raided? Meh. Losing 5 years worth of stuff? Not so much.
---
I not even by the wildest stretch of the imagination can the horde of zombie bees can count as, "best."

* Best pilots - no.
---
For Linux the easiest way to install and play is by using steam. simply install it from there and you should be good to go
---
No, getting ahead as a new player is literally easier than it's ever been. It wasn't so long ago that null alliances spat at newbies. Nowadays you can have access to null within a day of creating a character. Not only, but information on how to make isk is more accessible than it has ever been. A VNI is on the low end of isk-making for all but the freshest characters. Hell, a 1 week old character can make better isk than that with exploration or gas huffing, and if you've got the skills to fly a proper VNI, you could be making a tooooon more isk just by daytripping to WH space.
---
Long winded post ahead, but I feel like this requires an in depth explanation. The way it was set up last time, the easiest way to finish the mission was to camp out in a newbie system and go shoot a rat at an infinite spawn starter mission. Everybody can do it almost instantly in a newbie ship, regardless of your skills. From there, it gets progressively harder to "just find a rat" the farther you go from highsec. As you venture into low, null, and wormholes, it gets more and more time consuming and risky to go and do your daily.  
---
So who cares, you might ask. It's optional. Why not just forget about it if it's too much hassle? The problem with that is while the activity is optional, the structure of it and the effect that it has on players isn't. Here's what I mean. I remember running the isk/hr numbers of the old dailies and they came out to be something like 2b/hr if you did it in easy mode, including log-in time, *3 years ago*. Granted you could only do like 30 seconds of this super ratting a day, but calculated over time, the reward was extremely good for the effort you put in. But that was only true if you park your butt in the part of space where nothing ever happens the rest of the time.  
---
Keep this in mind while we consider some other facts of EVE. Firstly, this is a game where your fun isn't guaranteed. You put in the effort to go wormhole diving, it could end up in a bust, or you could have a fight you'd remember for years, but a lot of the time there's no real way to tell ahead of time. Same for roams or any other kind of self directed adventure. Secondly, SP is an enabler of fun. Training skills is boring as fuck, but the more you have of it, the better your character tends to perform, and the more options you'll have in what you can do well. Among other things, this increases your odds of having a better time on your adventure.  
---
Taken together, CCP introducing dailies in the way they did has just created an unavoidable opportunity cost equation where one didn't exist before. You can choose how you react to it, but you as a player will still have to face it. And that is, do I go easy mode ratting *now* to rack up SP for minimal effort, thereby increasing my chances of having a good time later while freeing myself up to go have fun now in Eurotrucker Simulator, or do I forego this easy SP now and actually go on an adventure, and risk it coming up a bust while *also* losing my daily bonuses? Every time you're on a strat-op getting blue balled, or wormhole diving and coming up empty, or trying to get a good fight in FW and wondering what you're doing with your life, every time you spend the effort to try and actually make things happen in this game and come up short, that little unfulfilled daily reminder is rubbing salt in the wound, telling you that you could have just sat out this nonsense in highsec and gotten a nice little bundle of SP for doing nothing. But if you actually did that, you're end up endlessly deferring taking part in the activities that are actually rewarding and make you more engaged with the game.  
---
So that's what's wrong with dailies. They end up forcing players to pit their potential current enjoyment against their potential future enjoyment. And no matter which way they choose, there's *always* an opportunity cost involved. Players simply can't have it both ways and go on a grand adventure while also shooting insta-rats in highsec. A log in reward is one thing. Everyone has to log in to play the game anyway, but doing any kind of activity reward in a game where many players can't or don't want to do that activity is shooting yourself in the foot. You're forcing your customers to contemplate min-maxing behavior, which you created, that will either promote disengagement with your product. or resentment against your design decisions. There's no good reason for any company to do that.

Oh not again

new players can make much better money ratting in a battleship. But that requires looking at the screen, huh

I honestly didn’t think I was gonna like this game but reading all the war stories and betrayal ones sparked my interest. It’s far more interesting to play the game and experience it than to just read about it.

Switch to a domi. It's that easy. Or, you know, do what I do and find a better way to make isk. Drone ratting is poverty isk.

If you're fuckin paying any attention at all it works. Try actually playing the video game, it's more fun that way.

The only problem is that it's an alpha, so can't be dual boxed. Without that restriction I would have totally gone for bait drake.

Or you know CCP could made smart design decisions that don't set off their customer base of autistic nerds. Playing the hand you're dealt and not the hand you want is as true for companies as it is for gamers. In an ideal fairy tale world, all your customers might be zen enough to not give a shit about free SP, but those 20 account running turbo autists pay the bills and keep the game populated, so why piss them off unnecessarily?

Lmfao this comment hahaha
---
Also just a heads up, we are currently at war with like a dozen alliances and corporations at the moment one of which being Goonswarm Federation (largest alliance in the game currently).
---
We're also at war with a few highsec and lowsec groups too.
---
1. Never get attached to ships. They will be destroyed \[not *if, when*\]. People lose ships all the time, it’s as mundane as breathing. There’s precisely nothing special about losing ships. Get a new one, carry on.
---
2. Never complain about losing ships, there’s no point.
---
3. Never get angry, sad and tell the people who blew up your boat. They WANT that. Tears are the biggest prize.
---
4. If you can’t replace the boat, don’t fly the boat
---
5. Flying the boat without having the skills to properly fit the boat is pointless. Don’t do it.
---
6. NEVER pay CODE a single goddamn ISK.
---
7. You do EVE your way. Don’t let anyone dictate a play style.
---
8. When your boat gets popped, you know their name. Take down their name. Remember their name when you have the right skills and ships next time you meet.
---
9. You already know you can ask for help.
---
10. If you need actual moral support, the real kind, find the broadcastforreps channel and ask help. You will get help, you’re not alone. Seek help first \[this one is 100% totally serious\].
---
11. Have fun. Never forget to have fun.
---
Lumio pbuh
---
Bit out of context. They just want to make your game unfun.
---
Got it. Guess everyone was correct in saying I’m going to be losing a lot of ships then lol
---
If you find EVE, and many people don’t, it’s one of the best experiences in gaming today.
---
yes
---
And none of those things can be done with an alpha clone.
---
If you’re wanting the express lane to FW just join a corp in the faction you want. You’ll get standings after that from kills &amp; missions.
---
Isn't that against the EULA?
---
The only thing I can say to that is HTFU and learn to cater to whiney bitches if you want their money.
---
Stomping sleepers is a fleet is fun.
---
Why you so bad mods?

Run the sisters of eve epic arc once. Finish with the faction you want to raise standing with. Done.

Stick around, man. We have [industrial levels of fun](https://imgur.com/8eE2xnh).

Hit and run is the very point of bombers. They are not designed to fight huge nullblob response fleets. We dont do kitchen sink welp fleets, if we started to welp our bomber fleets for no reason people wouldnt come to them anymore.

This is disgusting.  They warp in, activate bomb and cloak up before they even materialize.  Litteraly.  There is just no time to do anything else.  Like how is this supposed to be fair.  Meanwhile Fozzie is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.

I do play the game, thank you. Once you are bumped you lose the ability to maneuver, and even if you started moving the moment you saw a bumper, you wouldn't be able to move out of the way in time.

Thank you very much ✊🏼✊🏼. It’s comments like this that are making me love the game.
---
Thanks homie 🙏🏼

Thank you!!!!

Yeah I find this quite useful for PI management on the go

Fortuantly, in this instance no risk is being removed, as having some kind of bump immunity when tethered was always the design intention.

Fun fact about me: I took a computer class in high school to be CISCO certified and was most likely told that but spent the entire time playing flash games and cheating off people.
---
Clever bubbles, cloaked combat scans, planets, structures.
---
If we jump in and can't combat you down in a site because you warped off we will know what direction you warped in using d scan and some other methods. If it's not to a planet Sig or structure, you warped either to a safe or a WH which we will scan down in seconds.
---
Also we can tell what your up to by d scanning wreaks and looking for mobile tractor units. 
---
There are many many very fast methods to catch ratters. A seasoned WH vet will find you within seconds using very fast tackle ships.
---
warp vni to site orbit collidable launch drones.
---
???
---
So if all I have to do is log in all my accounts to get it, which can be done with a single click and then log right back out, then it's ok, but if I have to actually play the game and accomplish something then it's a shit idea?  Then you blame CCP because of this perceived loss of an inconsequential amount of SP because YOU don't want to do the activity. 
---
This will be mainly beneficial to new players and help them skill up quicker. It will take a longer time to make a noticeable difference for older players. As much as Eve players talk about wanting to help get new players in to the game and retain them you would think they would applaud any ideas that could help with that, yet you stupid fucks shoot down any idea that you feel you couldn't completely maximize without putting in more time. 
---
I've never met a more whiney bunch of fucking crybabies in my whole life, yet to hear Eve players talk about themselves they are the most intellectual and hard-nosed MMO players on the planet. I suppose it's HTFU until something hurts your sensitive ass little feelings huh?
---
Extract and use the money for Plex. Slow burn your character for free time.
---
Good try
---
his ideas are very good
---
Rudy may have to dig it out from under his pog collection
---
It's no worries! You can get replacements for most ships. :)
---
Also there are plenty of people to help out and plenty of fleets to join that have a newbean wing to help newbies.
---
The best solution, and also one that would ruin game at a fundamental level is end the player market outside player structures. CCP would then set prices on all/seed things everywhere. Isk would work in CCP's favor as they set pricing. Avalabilty goes up, and players play. At the same time this would end eve as we know it.
---
Give it Giggsy till the end of the season.
---
Yea actual afk ratters are not a problem, they are taking a risk of losing their ship if enemies come through.  My VNI died just the other day because a gang came into system while I was taking a dump.  Also drone auto-aggression doesn't work as well as you think,  against serpentis rats I have to check my drones every couple of minutes to make sure they're attacking because even with an auto-targeter and a close orbit they stop fighting the rats almost every wave.
---
Relatively minimum afk income where you're actually risking a ship being afk IS NOT a problem.
---
Botters that instantly dock up 10 gilas or VNIs systemwide the second a neut enters local and thus generate afk income en masse with 100% safety are the problem.  I know we've all seen it.  5-10 characters with obvious alt names in a system, multiple VNIs gone to a structure within 10 seconds of you entering local.  It's cancer.  Drones auto-aggressing and blapping some bad that tries to solo-tackle my VNI with an AF while I'm in the bathroom isn't the issue.  15-20m afk ticks aren't a problem until you scale it up to multiple characters and automate it.
---
have you tried a mobile micro jump drive? 
---
You can carry one in your cargo. Deploy it in that situation and then jump 100km. If you select the 100km that is on the opposite side of the garmur pointing you - depending on your ship you might get away.

---
Bounties, I don’t see why the anom rats don’t drop all their value in tags or salvage like sleepers do. This type of ratting is wasteful as well.
---
Then you have to kill and salvage in one ship, bookmark and come back, or have a alt or corpmate do it. If would add a few extra steps, probably bad for bots as well.
---
It doesn't matter what stats you quote at me. Obviously they are being abused
---
Heavy missiles can be heavy or rapid heavy
---
Depends on what you do with your main, what other alts you have, your playstyle...
---
Bad ship design.  ECM-bonused brawl frigate is a dumb idea.  Under the old system it was just an instant win for 1v1, now it's useless.  But as others have said ecm boats in small gangs that can jam you from range while their buddies tackle you are pretty cancer.  Most fits can't do shit but die against Griffin 50k off while scrammed.
---
On the off chance this isn't bait: It sounds like you have a serious gaming addiction. Unsub some accounts, get a job, and get therapy.
---
We have no context here, people are freaking out needlessly.
---
Notice how EVE North had the slide about player retention being a problem? I would hazard a guess this is part of a solution to that. Creating an incentive for new players to get engaged with the PVE of the game by rewarding them with instant gratification in the form of SP. I think something a lot of veteran players tend to forget is how irritating it is to start this game on a fresh character. All those skills that go towards fittings, resistances (shield/armor), navigation, perfecting your missiles/gunnery/drones, and so on. It's a slog, it's boring, and that is why such a small percentage of players stick with EVE after a few weeks.
---
I know what you're thinking. Grrrr I had to fly a t1 rifter for a month until I could fly the next upgrade, so and so forth. I've been there and I would rather new players be given some SP for completing tasks that at the same time help them become self sufficient as these rewards seem to facilitate NPE towards.
---
If we want this game to continue well into its second decade, we need new players to try it out, and STICK with. Let's clam down.
---
I can't find it but there was a screenshot posted a while back of CCP Guard taking action against a player when he was a GM for bumping a player to keep them from warping. This was like ages ago though and it seems they reversed course on it and haven't looked back for a while
---
That's a clever username, btw.
---
No offence but I don’t want to have to engage in the shitty ass PvE EVE has to offer just to not fall behind. If it was something that was actually fun, I’d be more open to it.

To give the elite small gang boys killmails, but apparently afk killmails give less sense of accomplishment than someone who is at their keyboard while tackled by a loki and a keres.

Apparently they don't realize that they will never kill a non-afk subcap ratter, because local exists.

Eh the damage and ehp on the rats is quite heavy, and they web/scram at a site that anyone entering system can instantly warp to.  I prefer not to sit there for 10-15 minutes with something below 1000 DPS.

I generally use a 1600 DPS rattlesnake, more mobile than a carrier and clears them almost as fast + extremely tanky so a solo hunter landing on you is a nonissue.

Warriors are the fastest of the drones too making your tracking even more important.

I actually have a pretty healthy little meta going with my friends with this game. We've got something like 8-10 decks that are -relatively- balanced.

Is there a way to tell if it's turned on?

Yes, I enabled all the boxes, but the client never seems to have downloaded anything, and I see no difference.

---
Mining bitcoins.
---
Has it not always been like that?
---
Its not
---
hail has a tracking penalty
---
&gt; I do, actually. If you read the full post I assume that only the "spire" sections are given over to civilian habitation and that the "core" section is used for vessel docking and management.
---
Ah, yeah. :) I meant that I didn't think that you were miscalculating it as in lowballing it. For the Keepstar to have shipyards and supercapital and capital-sized docking, the core has to pretty much only be that. Which means the spires has to be given up to everything else, not just habitation. All commercial, support (power, life support, industry and so on) and agricultural zones has to be stuffed in there as well.
---
Nope, if you are nullified you land where you aim and can take off from inside the bubble as well.
---
Its like the bubble isnt there at all for you.
---
That Hawk is like:  
---
"COME ON, YOU SONS OF BITCHES, DO YOU WANT TO LIVE FOREVER???!!!!!!??!!!!!!"
---
Could you also accomplish this by using a drag bubble trap (this not needing a dictor and maybe not a frigate?) the dumber pilots will try warping directly to gates, where cargo containers or your own ship can decloak them.
---
I think this is a shitpost, if it’s not, then only thing I gotta ask is if you are putting in 40 hrs just to PLEX several accounts, why the hell are you only running anoms for isk?
---
There are other things you could do with that many accounts, focusing on just ratting for isk is just the most basic lazy thing you could do.
---
As for PvP, get in ship, fly to other ships, shoot them, die, get gud.
---
&gt;So if all I have to do is log in all my accounts to get it, which can be done with a single click and then log right back out, then it's ok, but if I have to actually play the game and accomplish something then it's a shit idea?  
---
Log in rewards are mostly okay because they encourage players to *log in*. What they do past that point isn't an issue, since the goal should be to get more players logged in. This is a sandbox game after all. Structured play shouldn't be the design goal. If players just log right out again, then at least they poked their head in the game when they wouldn't have otherwise. It builds player engagement and attachment to the game by at least reminding them to stick with it and pick it up again when they have the time and inclination.  
---
&gt;but if I have to actually play the game and accomplish something then it's a shit idea?  
---
That's precisely the issue here. A structured daily activity that can be done *most easily* in the part of space where nothing happens encourages players to *go to the place where nothing happens*. If players were getting rewarded for seeking out "this is EVE" level fights, that would be different. But that's not what's going on here. This is the game telling players if you park your ass at the place where nothing happens, your odds of getting a "this is EVE" level fight *in the future* goes up, which is flaming pants on head retarded. You can't expect to build a system that encourages unhealthy player behavior and then throw a fit when players feel resentful for being pushed to take part in that unhealthy behavior. I mean you could, that's CCP for you, but they really should be smarter than this after they tried it the last time.
---
Well EVE does have Planck Generators which are used for compressing down items such as ships, modules, ammunition, etc. So it's conceivable that the docking space is bigger on the inside while the residential spires are kept normal scale due to the cost of keeping Planck generators running where it isn't strictly necessary.        
---
You could also model the spires as more spare and use the 40% leftover space for industry instead of recreation. Do bear in mind that the lower estimate provided assumes agricultural areas stuffed in the spires already, as part of the 60% of space devoted to habitation.
---
Alphas can't use T2 anything else so it makes sense
---
&gt; So essentially Alphas who have trained Medium Drones V will lose what was a ~15+ Day train and not get their SP back.
---
Uh no, if they go back to Omega they'll have access to the omega portion of the skill. That's how the entire system works.
