Quits game to remove EVE from IRL

Oh well... should've seen teminal stage serenity, literally more than 80% of online were bots, shouldn't be surprised some bot over there seeped in here after serenity closed down.

---
wow it's krabtarded
---
I'm going to let you in on a secret, though
---
Greed is your problem, not spawn rates
---
Several sites other than rock havens and ring sanctums offer perfectly viable income, a low truesec at index 5 can easily support half a dozen or more carrier/super ratters and below like -0.8/0.9 over a dozen
---
Density prematurely becomes an issue when everyone is a braindead krabtard who refuses to run anything other than the rock haven respawn
---
I think it would very much be in your interest to unsub and see if you can find something else to do which provides a path to pulling your head out of your ass, because it's fairly well assured Eve is not the only area of your life that suffers from how far up there you've got it buried
---
I didn't even know about this. That was an interesting read.
---
So CCP has been down this road before and were forced to dial back. Good. Hopefully they won't dial it up again and instead find out how to keep the game alive and well, as it is.
---
You can make everything in your game become perfect with three button presses, but if a player starts the game up, is confused, and has to go look up what three buttons to press to fix the game so they can use it, they are much less likely to hang around.
---
Comparing to a lot of other games out there, I think we should consider ourselves lucky it's not worse.
---
Though I don't really see a problem with PLEX. You don't have to buy it, you can just pay the subscription fee, if you want. If you make enough in-game money you can use it to keep your omega state, which many players do. What's the harm in that?

BTW, may I have some of your stuff, you can contract it in game to Foxstar Damaskeenus?
---
Just replying to your risk averse comment.
---
Things like plex itself isn't there for greed's sake, its there for necessities sake. If you are or not allowed to buy isk with cash people still want to do it for some reason. So if you don't offer them a legitimate outlet they will turn to illegitimate outlets encouraging even more botting and account compromises to feed them with their ill gotten isk.
---
Do you have to use a new line for every sentence?   You can take basic English composition courses at your local community college.  
---
They may have anoms to spare, but they're going to have to split up and spread out that cap umbrella.
---
If you don't think that's effective at reducing the oppressiveness of cap umbrellas, look at how many Supers get whacked in Fountain
---
Hey man this one is too high effort to get yourself banned to quit EVE. Try easier things like rmt.

Oh wait...

The joys of multiboxing more than a dozen rorquals.
---
Scamming new players in highsec.
---
Yes and no. so the name I'd chosen for my old main had some bad memories attached to it (was a handle I used during a really bad part of my life that i'd rather forget) so when I came back for "one last stab at eve" I decided to create a new main, was sitting at around 50 or 60m SP scattered all over the place, so I extracted everything I could (having to sell a bunch of SP along the way to keep paying for more extractors) and injected them into a new character.  
---
Ended up with around 20m SP, all put into combat skills for ships cruiser sized and below, and about 1b liquid. so not "quite" brand new, but pretty damn close except that I could fly ships from a few more races than a brand new player would have been able to.  
---
3 years later, longest break i've taken was 2 weeks to recharge after being in various campaigns for a good year or so. now run 25 accounts, and just injected my first titan skillbook today, so i'd say starting over worked pretty damn well for me.
---
The feels when wormhole ore sites have also been affected by this. Prior to this patch we had 3-4 different ore Anoms spawning in the local WH. Nowadays we're lucky to see even one during the WEEK!   
---
Give me my rocks back, without the Spod I am nuffin!

No homo man.

This right here.

russian btw.

So, you can actually travel anywhere within a system in Elite seamlessly. Same as Star Citizen. It's the transition to other systems that requires a loading screen. When Star Citizen eventually adds a second star system, the same will be true.

Seems like OP‚Äôs alliance is gonna get...Vastly Outnumbered.

Cap has been trying to lure new players forever, and those efforts hit overdrive in 2012.

 https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-12-05-as-eve-online-retribution-expansion-launches-ccp-reveals-master-plan-to-make-its-famously-impenetrable-mmo-accessible
---
Of course it did work and marked the start of the decline of EVE, a game that had up till then resisted rhe decline other moms were experiencing.
---
Trying to change a thing that is already good in order to get more people to consume it usually ends in disaster.  See NEW COKE.
---
Cap should have gone the route of reinforcing the games strengths rather that watering it down in hope of new players.
---
this is him officially requesting ccp to add the feature. all the years of people suggesting it before have gone unanswered because they were not official requests
---
the drone battleship has a web, about 13-14km in range so try to orbit slightly outside of that.
---
Isn‚Äôt that the same thing?
---
Eve is the only game that can get my heart pounding
---
inb4 alliance spam. 
---
I wish someone had written a Jita chat bot that learns what people say over time.

I am 95% sure it will inevitably say something about ISK doubling after a while
---
He owns a mac. 
---
You must be new to the internet
---
Never said anything about risk averse, You have to risk something to smash into a wall, my comment was they don't do it successfully. 
---
You guys still exist?
---
How?
---
1. You make them cheap enough that cheap entities can afford them. They're now so cheap they will have no noticeable effect on the economy. Depending on what the NPCs actually do (like troll bash structures), it will either be spammed and be a constant nuissance, or not be used at all.
---
2. Price it so that it's fairly expensive for medium sized alliances. This hurts the little guy as they can't afford it anymore. The larger (richer) the alliance, the less an impact price has. This would be an indirect nerf to small alliance, which imo is exactly what we need MORE of.
---
3. Make it a large investment even for large alliances/coalitions
---
With that isk, you can probably batphone other guys, or just use your massive numbers to achieve whatever the NPCs were supposed to do. The ability will rarely, if ever, be used.
---
Idk man, I don't see how it would be an effective isk sink.
---

---
Hello fellow marketeer.
---
I read (almost) all of this thread and it gave me cancer. By the end of it they started to tell to each other that the other one is literally eaten shit. Don't thank me for saving your time and brain health.
---
Yeah every minute not ratting is a lot of lost isk, only "looting" I do is drop an my on sites that had faction rat or dread spawn. That I safe spot and collect when I'm done
---
You're quite welcome! It's good to hear I've helped or inspired someone to have more fun in Eve!
---
&lt;3
---
No.
---
Rich faggot quits game 
---
Dont let the door hit you on the way out
---
this is the weirdest way to advertise that you would like to sell some AT ships
---
One way ingame is to open the Map (F10, or button on the left menu). In the top left corner, the second option is 'color by'. Select 'security status' and zoom out. Anything yellow is 0.5, anything orange -&gt; red is 0.4 -&gt; 0.0. 
---
You can also color by other things to help determine how active it is, like ships destroyed in the last 24 hours and pilots active in the last 30 minutes. If you highlight over a dot, it'll show you the system name and how many jumps away it is.
---
You weren't around last year were you?
---
If you open your directional scanner (Alt + D) you can see what is around you. It's max range is about 14AU, and people use this scanner to find you. If they see a mining ship on directional scan, they'll narrow down which belt you are in and find you and blow you up.
---
If you find an asteroid belt that is 14AU away from the stargates, it'll require the hunter to come a lot closer to you at first to narrow down where you are, and if you aren't on immediate scan range they may move on to the next system.
---
You should use the directional scanner as well to check if new ships are popping up near by.
---
Remember fighting you in the Tama pipe pre-Black Rise and Fleet Warfare circa 07-08. You made me want to fly Battleships and I flew Maelstroms exclusively for like two years. Enjoy life o7.
---
What if their was a small chance that ratting sites would suddenly escalate to levels that would kill a VNI
---
So if you where AFK ratting eventually a dreadnought would spawn and since you weren‚Äôt paying attention you would lose your ship.
---
You don't know how businesses get money do you?  They get it from selling things.  CCPs business is subscriptions and PLEX.  That is it.  There is nothing else they make money from.  
---
No business stays in business by promoting free content while ignoring the paying customers.  
---
Sorry that you are too stupid to understand.
---
How do you know. If I really want to jump into eve and either have made a ton of isk  or am willing to spend real money, shouldn‚Äôt I be allowed to skip skill training
---
That is because you have posted idiotic comments throughout the thread.  Post smarter things, I am not forced to insult you.  
---
Not a single one of the ideas you have brought forth in this entire thread is good, or even mediocre.  They are all 100% terrible.  That is indicative of someone who should probably not be on the internet, but should instead be at school learning basic problem solving skills.
---
A solid counter? No.
---
I think I just had a seizure.
---
You can still stick around and do things like Abyssals if you just need to timebox. I have young kids as well, and the 20 minute timers help me ensure I can do a run or two and accomplish something in even a short session. You can dabble in the PVP too if you want to throw some blingy ships around!
---
Either way, fly safe and take care of that new family of yours. o7
---
What a waste of ships. At least give them out to randomers to have some fun in and lose hysterically in a ball of fire. Doesn't even have to be me,just give them out to people who will use them instead of sitting in a hanger to rot...
---
Good luck in real life though. 
---
The person with zero knowledge how game business works is definitely you.  You have not, in our entire dialog, shown that you have a clue about the business side of anything, much less the video gaming industry.  The F2P model that you are pushing is how companies go out of business.

Can this be a skin?
---
I mean, I wouldn't buy it, but like an April fools skin
---
Just don't rep them then.  You don't need to pod in LS unless you are trying to pad your KB like a tryhard anyway.
---
Anom respawns for havens have been.increased to an average of 15 minutes with a 3 minute variance (+/- 3). 
---
Rarity of sanctums increased as well. Even in a -1.0 system the number of sanctums dropped and respawn increased inline with the havens.
---
Again, you're completely clueless. Eve is not a proper F2P game. It's a half-assed F2P/subscription game that doesn't know what it wants to be.
---
Right now, it's stuck in the middle, making everybody unhappy, including ignorant vets like you that have zero idea how businesses work.
---
officially downvoted

Worf did it better.

I request this idea two times and still nothing happen :-/

How do you know that I can speak Russian?

CCPlease, let this man/girl fly thru Jovian space and give him/her max level achievement in your new activity tracker thingy. thx
---
For some time the Minnie fw Corp TRIAD actually did this internally as far as I know. Not sure if they still do. 
---
This is an extremely big yikes.
---
How would that work for anything longer than 3 the three short lines that you've shown?
---
\&gt;Ship Creator: XXXVOREMEDADDYUWU69X
---
yeah i can see this going well
---
i noticed this too, been broken for about 2 weeks now. I just use 'set destination' to quick find where something is instead
---
unless he do it in 1-2% of hull  i think mtu should be not launchable while in pvp timers
---
I'd imagine that from an internal perspective, unassembled ships and items aren't stored as *instances* of those items but rather as a simple *count* of items.
---
That is. Imagine having 10 unassembled Rifter hulls. Within the database, you would be said to have a 10 assemblies left for item XYZ (the Rifter's item number). Not 10 individual items, yet, but rather the ability to generate 10 of them. - Now imagine if you assemble one. The database would then say you have 9 assemblies left, but also an *instance* of the item with it's own ID number. Each assembled *instance* of a hull can have individual properties assigned to it (fittings, rigs, names, cargo, etc...) but until it's assembled it only exists as a raw count of hulls you could potentially assemble. - If you then Repackage the Rifter, the *instance* is destroyed and the assembly count for the Rifter at that station is increased by 1.
---
Which is what would make your idea problematic. The hulls don't actually exist as individual items until assembled, so they wouldn't be able to have individual properties like it's creator's name assigned. The hulls would have to remain assembled forever, or the property would be lost.
---
That sounds terrible. Just off the top of my head. If I saw someone making a lot of ships I'd wonder how/where/when and crash their party. I'm sure more creative people can think of ways to ruin people's day once they find out who is doing what. 
---
Haha I mean you already get doses of something similar with who you buy things from, who kills you, who you kill, silly ship names, so forth and so on.
---
Exactly these examples proof how retarded and ignorant you are. A properly-designed free to play game will NEVER EVER give you the feeling you're a second-rate player that's utterly handicapped like Eve does.
---
That's just incredibly consumer-unfriendly amateur marketing. But you wouldn't know that because you don't know shit about marketing.
---
Google "greentext" and get learnt
---
Perhaps something noting where (what system) and when a ship was built, rather than the name of the builder. 
---
Aye, thou doth speak truly, for the effects of gravity are indimishable, yet thou must understand that the man would not fall in the direction of "down", but float backwards, for he has not the velocity as the spaceship.
---
all these entitled millenials downvoting you have an upvote
---
Don't most of the ships get manufactured in ridiculous volumes in nullsec?
---
Thanks for the 2017 Christmas Gift :)
---
someone  do this on capital ship and post results
---
who beat PL in 2018 :(
---
How many donations will RvB take to assist Horde in taking out TESTs Perimeter Keepstar? Casino money wants to know.
---
correct
---
furthermore, storing each item as an instance rather than the way it's likely currently done - i.e as a count - would require more resources and be less efficient
---
I mean you could do the same thing by just finding miners and watching them for a few days. Following haulers, getting their locations through npcs. So on and so forth. Dont get me wrong I get what you're saying but I see no difference from just buying one ship then looking to see who sells it and tracking down their production line that way. Some people have a designated market toon that live in trade hubs in npc corps to combat that. I'm sure manufacturers would do the same.
---
o7         
---
I wouldn't be surprised if CCP brings back the AT in another form, or allows another type of tournament to flourish.
---
Terrorising new players trying out mining, trading and exploring seems like the best way to keep the player base dwindling.
---
Problem:  "Duurr,  imma pirate doh, ammi right hur hur"
---
Be CCP, have game that survives off being an unforgiving niche, see see casual MMOs and wow clones die all around you for years, decided the best thing you can do is undermine core aspects of said game and start chipping away at what made it a successful niche to try and appeal to a casual audience, be surprised the game is losing players and stagnating. In the future when game dies blame it on a lack of an audience and acknowledge none of you mistakes, sign up with RIOT.
---
So just like an achievement system?
---
get close to karybdis
---
get far from bethnic
---
yes i was, it was one of the best ui changes ccp ever did but everybody on reddit are retarded babies with parkinsons
---
INCREASED RESPAWN TIME!!
---
I have 3 rorq pilots and ive grown to hate mining for isk, its really boring.
---
Cloaky campers and small gangs hunting excavators helped to fuel that hate so I started ratting.
---
Now something tells me im gonna hate ratting when every decent system has 6-8 supers in it.
---
The good news is the regions with the most true sec systems just turned into promising targets for warmongers who wanna expand or relocate for growth, meaning war content.
---
Very true. At least for me eve is alive. Can't get enough of the big wars and politics involved. 
---
I respectfully disagree with you on this one, sir
---
I have just given you an entire list of games that do the exact same model as Eve Online.  I am sorry that you don't understand at all.  It is clear to everyone around that you are an idiot, so I shall disengage because some people, such as yourself, will never understand economics or game design.
---
Good day.

Best wishes on your next journey.  7o

Too much like a job. The whole everyone is a spy thing kind of gets on my nerves as well. If you want to try the game  I would recommend Pandemic Horde as your first corp. .  They have some really good players and they give you the best chance at Plexing your account imho. 
---
NSA
---
I mean, it wasn't empty or unneeded, but I also understand that having Chutlain on your border in 2019 is essentially sending your children to a school that promotes anti-vax stuff. You're not really sure you can trust what's going on down there.
---
I miss u friend
---
Compared to a chinese MMO? Sure.
---
Compared to a Western MMO? Not really. Injectors have changed the game A LOT. I don't think there's any western MMO that has been as P2W as plex and injectors, not one I can think of. Even none MMOs like GTA aren't that bad :P
---
Last time I came back into the game after a break was jsut before skill injectors went live. I came back for that, to strip my indy / mining characters and pump the skills elsewhere to do stuff I actually enjoyed. And I brought a long time friend with me a couple months later after I re-established myself.
---
What I noticed is that its not necessarily the NPE and the brand new player issues, I mean, sure, those are definetly there, but the larger thing that makes them leave is when they come to a realization of what metagaming in Eve is like. Multi accounts required, multi everything, and activities that are just craptastic such as VNI ratting, Rorq mining, etc. Poeple want to play to actually play, not AFK in multiple windows and go do laundry or watch netflix or play another game.
---
If whatever it is you are doing in Eve is so horrible that you jsut have to go play another game while doing it, then that is a gigantic issue in itself. Guys like him come in, give it a shot, then realize how much shit it is and basically stop logging on because they don't see the point of running Eve in background while they play other games. And he was actually pretty typical, I have seen quite a lot of people like him.
---
Matter of opinion.  
---
  
---
And honestly it's really not that much money if you seriously play the game. The simple reality is that online multiplayer games cost money to run and cost even more if you want them actively staffed and to see updates, bug fixes, etc.
---
:words:
---
Cool. I will check this out when I get home. If I find a good place to mine how do I find somewhere I can dock to with the ore to compress it? The logistics are baffling. 
---
Solution: make a new eden again. Open a portal. On the other side of the portal, you restart from scratch. Then make system in old eden slowly disappear, until there are only something like a small collection of system.
---
It will force everyone to FINALLY fight it out with all they have. It will give new player and old player the FUN of building again. The thrill of the race to success.
---
A slow and fun genesis. 
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
FRIENDDDD do you like, still play Eve: Online?
---
Fun Fact: You are my reddit friend so you showed up red when you commented, and for a hot second I thought you were a mod/admin
---
Also: MISS YOU TOO VERY (X2) MUCH 
---
rupee was a scammer and a rmt-er, not an elite market baron
---
You gave me a list that confirms you don't know shit about proper F2P. Go try Apex Legends and maybe then you'll understand the difference between F2P tagged-on and F2P build from the ground up. 
---
Bye Felicia
---
See you in a few months. Fortunately, this post won't be as visible.
---
&gt; been a wild leap to predict they would be nerfed further.
---
especially with them saying "we'll do this again"
---
Those juicy snake pods gotta die somehow.
---
i just bought  thanatos in  system decon i would like to know who built it and who moved it to decon ebfore i bought it how to find orginal owner of that ship?
---
There are still lots of things other games have that CCP has not really explored:
---
* Selling character slots or other account-based convenience
---
* Selling name changes or corp name changes (which were available for sale on the Chinese server)
---
* Selling visual tweaks like unique warp effects, unique cloak effects, unique cyno effects, etc
---
* Selling premium avatar portrait items like special backgrounds, animated portraits, etc
---
* Further monetizing the Alpha/Omega system into Beta/Gamma/Delta clones to capture Alpha players who can't afford Omega but would be willing to pay some tier in between free and $15 a month
---
you can know if he was online by lipstick traces on your ship joystick in cockpit.
---
But I just really enjoy podding people. 
---
well I dunno my southern bell grandma always said
---
"Mo' Money, Mo' Probbems"
---
Yes, I too enjoy waiting the full year or so until you get 15-20M SP and can fly some subcap stuff (1-2 racial cruisers/BCs and down) semi-competitively. Good way to retain new players.
---
BLINK, MOTHERFUCKER!
---
Trade actually contributes a lot.
---
First of all, economics. Without trade and reselling, stuff doesn't move. Particularly in a game like EVE with a localized inventory system, market gaming and hauling provide essential connections that unify the universal economy and in many cases makes activity like fleet combat possible and viable.
---
But I assume you're just talking about station traders and the 0.01 isk game. Even then, yes: trade is absolutely essential. Traders taking advantage of margins and seeding markets set and negotiate prices in a free economy. If there is any competition, they drive prices as a whole to be fair--that is, accurately value the item to match supply and demand.
---
It doesn't produce anything of value directly, but the overall effect of trade is to generate relatively fair prices and high availability for commodities.
---
Exactly why you lose insurance/ kill marks when repackaging also
---

ftfy
---
Oh so you think that the people with a dozen rorquals are their disposal should be the only one allowed to fly ships then? Aren't they already super rich already?
---
Not sure for alpha but Nom ratting is pretty easy as and decent enough isk
---
I whelped my wallet because i knew for sure I‚Äôd never come back. 
---
That worked out well
---
They have high alpha and good speed but their tracking is arty tracking which is shit.
---
AB and TD are your friends. If their fleet isnt well coordinated you can even use ADCs to improve trade. Something like Ishtars works pretty well.
---
hey jin
---
i know we love to give you guys shit but let it be known that we appreciate our beloved csms and ccps. thanks for working hard at making this game what it is.
---
I played solo for the first 7 or so months, mostly market pvp and missions.
---
Unless you want to get into role play and the associated lore Eve really doesn't have much of an overarching story that affects players everyday lives.
---
The PvE experience isn't good. I still do missions, and rotate through the same 15-18 scenarios and shoot the same bad guys. Others have filled you in on Abyssal space, I don't have any experience with that
---
My current Corp is focused on exploration, and therefore the vast majority of our pilots are flying solo near 100% of the time.
---
I've never been required to do any Corp ops or anything like that either. It's very nice.
---
No good packs I'm aware of but the price of plex in game keeps rising so your in luck. I'm in test and we are always flying something fun. 
---
Fewer
---
Also, am Stannis.
---
LOL, kinda like this...[https://zkillboard.com/kill/75632486/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75632486/)
---
As mentioned, the biggest problem is that ships are usually sold packaged.  Server side, it's difficult to code since it changes identity once packaged.
---
Lol what a scrub, he undocked his ship.
---
It's ok falcon. You'll be ok.
---
Oh very nice, we absolutely need that!
---
Also counter of shots for every weapon! Crucial information!
---
Logistics reps should make a permanent mark on ship! We should know who tried their best to keep your ship alive! Sooo needed!
---
And top damager to the hull too! We should know his name, how we live without this info?!
---
RIP super builds who smuggle ships out of the region against the wishes of their masters.
---
Easy fix. Make it a generic entity in the DB. then give that entity its properties, like what ship it is. What state its in (packaged or not), who did what kind of interaction on it, etc. Not hard. 
---
Can we also get a report bot button
---
A valid tactic.
---
Once an item is packaged and stacked, it loses all identities other than packaged item XYZ.  An item cannot be stacked with differing properties, think laser Crystals.  
---
That's just coding.  Let alone what if you had a stack of 200 catas.  How would you identify the single one made by pilot xxxdeathpussyxxx
---
RIP anti-Imperium mouthpiece
---
They did this for abyssal items. If you want to be a maker of personalized stuff that has your name on it forever, get into that racket.
---
Thanks. Is karybdis dps sugnificantly lower outside 50km? 
---
How come this is a good strategy?
---
You can also color it by 'has stations' or something like that, or you can right click on the system and view it's info to see what stations are there and what services they offer.
---
I have a few times orbited at like 5km. Does he only use it sometimes!
---
nobody cares who made a ship because literally anyone can make one. pile of minerals, blueprint, bam you get a ship.
---
who you buy things from is also irrelevant to 98% of people, except for market PVPers who might track their competition. If that info got removed I don't think it would really change anything.
---

I found that his cannon doesnt track outside of 50km, as in he straight up misses you.
---
the galaxy plex packs are p good deals but one time only, if youve already bought them for your account then it wont help you 
---
Date of creation would be nice too. Imagine if the apocalypse in my hangar is over a decade old.
---
Also why you have to sell a fitted ship on contract but can repackage to sell on market. Metadata is lost when you package. Same with BPCs. Research and runs are metadata, and can't be sold over the market.
---
This might clarify things:   
---
An Astronomical Unit (or AU) is a measure of distance, it's 150 million kilometers, or the average distance from the Earth to the Sun.  
---
D-Scan has a max-range of 14.3 AU. 
---
Streamfleet shooting streamfleet... Wooo!! Hahaha that is awesome, I was sad to have missed most of this but it sounds like it was a damn good time. More streamfleet fleets - let's do this!

AAR: Tonight the Sultan of Syndicate struck back from behind the keyboard of Life is Feudal and reinforced the Astrahaus of the KORAM and Siberian dogs.  Hydex, led his men into battle by logging into PFP and declaring it clear of NSH capitals who may be jerking off to pictures of Admiral Wheeler's boobs.  Luckily they were not.  At that point, M0AB and associates dropped 2 Archons on the best the bad guys could muster, a few VNIs, an Armageddon, and a rattlesnake.   Of course the bad guys could not compete and jumped into high sex.  Perhaps to bat-phone their Russian overlords.  More likely, to not feed to the overpowering knowledge of the Sultan of Syndicate, still busy leading his Life is Feudal guild in building a very large wall.
---
The good-guys capitals and sub-capitals then reinforced the Russian menace's Astrahaus to remind them who is in charge.  For one reason or another the bad guys saw a moment of weakness when the capitals withdrew their fighters.  They suddenly warped to 0 on the sub-caps, and began feeding to HydeX's amazing intel??

Not just MMOs, but games in general. There are many mobile games that are borderline predatory. This is happening in the MMO space as well, it's just happened earlier in the Asian market. Western players have pushed back against it, but it will happen. I maintain CCP is being retrained. And don't get me wrong, I'm onboard with less monetisation of the game I love.
---
I'm genuinely curious though, because I don't understand why people are so against it, but could you (or anyone else) explain the crux of why you hate skill injectors?
---
The way I see it, a player joins the game and doesn't want to grind. I totally understand that feeling. This person has money to spend and would rather jump into the game a little faster. They buy skill injectors and "level up" to 5M SP. Good start, get into the game, fly some decent ships. Many games do this. Whether this is "pay to win" really depends on your definition of "winning". This definition is different to every player and they find that for themselves. I don't have much experience with pvp, but it's my understanding that in EVE, combat is so detailed and deep that you have to *learn* it. It's not like many other games where you just get a dreadnought and you instantly win, you also have to know how to use said dreadnought. Industry and trading are the same, and these I do have experience with. 
---
And we didn't fuck up the extract this time :)
---
Lets throw it on the blockchain. ID ships as they are created by people in factories. Store them in a creator wallet. Use AWS QLDB. Reference the item when they look at the ship and do the call with lambda. 
---
It's one thing to adapt to a hard game, it another to adapt to getting more titans dropped on you than you have rl dudes in corp. You adapt by leaving, first the grid, then just not roaming in multiple regions, than you stop playing. 
---
Good bye "the DHB". You might still hate me but I do not hate you. For the better or worse, you are part of my eve history and my life. Good luck with your IRL endeavours.
---
Oh, and those kids crying around the corner about your uniques, they look pathetic. o7
---
I don't see any problems in introducing personalised stuff. I've bought a couple of expensive SKINs off the market because who could resist a bright red Charon! I don't buy clothing because I don't think it matters, but I understand why people do. If it makes CCP more money, then why not? It doesn't ruin the game one bit.
---
Why call it a quest tho?
---
Like, unless there is a story involved than it shouldn't be a 'quest'. More like a... contract, or a challenge. No story than it's not a quest.
---
A stack of [whatever] would be its own entity linking by keyid to a lookup table of child entities. Which in turn would either contain another lookup table for something else, or the entity's properties. Very modular. 
---
Fair enough.  Not hating.  But this would require a huge investment of resources when the game is already in maintenance mode and needing a lot of other fixes at the moment.
---
Being "packaged" is nothing more than a togglable state for the item. 
---
I think you should never post ever again
---
What‚Äôs wrong with my idea?
---
Woah, easy on the toxicity there bud.
---
It's a sandbox game where you can do anything. Recommend you forget about how you have played other games and just go for it. You don't have to be afraid of getting ganked or being part of stuff because it's just a game. It's not real life. Try to find a group that you want to be part of. The game gets better when you play it outside your comfort zone.
---
Yes. Hence likely not to happen. I always assume these kinds of ideas are simply academic discussions. 
---
what do you think this is? the eveo forums?

PLEX faaaaaaaaar pre-ceded being able to play for free. 2 week trials are what you used to get.

Long relational links are not very good for heavy transactional use. You need to keep the referential integrities, its alot of extra overhead.

That means a stack of 200 catalists are 200 rows and not 1 row.

Horrible idea or amazing shit post. 
---
I think the biggest thing wrong with it is that it has already been implemented something like 10 years ago in the form of officer spawns, officers were buffed like 8 years ago, then 2-3 years ago the class of similar mechanics which already exist was expanded further with the faction capital and supercapital spawns
---
Oh and tackle was added to rats
---
The problem with the theory that you can just "Solve AFK" is that you are a retard in the first place to believe that people are sitting there AFK enough to get owned

How dare anyone sit there and PVE then warp off when I show up in my purpose built VNI ganker

Adaptives can be left on all the time. The difference between the two Hobgoblin types is only, that integrated drones have overall better stats than T1, though it doesn't make a huge difference in this case.

Let me tell you about toxic:
---
One time, in 1DQ, this fuckboi and his fuckboi friendo we‚Äôre trying to bump me - an apostle - off the keepstar. This fuckboi and his fuckboi friendo knew I was there to protect the homelands on a cynos notice, but they didn‚Äôt care. All they cared about is their fuckboi giggles and fuckboi pranks, fuckboi‚Äôing all around the keepstar all fuckboish like. Then I was all ‚Äúyou know what? Fuck these fuckbois I quit for the night.‚Äù So I did. The fuckbois has no one to fuckboi with anymore.
---
Iirc those fuckbois were... oh wait it was you and judge...
---
Do you not believe in drone groups?
---
You could do anything if you felt like it, might ruin your game though :P It hardly feels like they are holding back. When aurum came out they even considering selling "gold" ammo that would do more damage. They've done quite a lot of bad already, saying they've been light on it is a disservice to how much they've p2wed eve already.

---
At least for ships larger or smaller than battleships there's a way to possibly know by the rigs. I've got a few large rigged frigates, destroyers, cruisers, and battlecruisers floating around. That change happened ~9 years ago, so those ships are at least 9 years old.

&gt; What causes the autism is the shadiness of it.
---
Have you been around here for a patch before? Doesn't matter what it is, there's autism. And if it negatively impacts nullseccers, there's LOTS of autism.
---
The shadiness, while unliked (though obviously for a good reason, the less people understand the mechanics the harder it is to game them), barely registers compared to the standard "oh no you nerfed by playstyle *reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee*.
---
Remember the times when we just had belt ratting and good DED sites to make ISK.  You dont know your born nowadays...
---
Tbh a lot of systems dont get used because they either dont have the upgrades installed or people are still obsessed with ratting in high sec status systems.  
---
You'll just have to upgrade more systems and use them.
---
dude, be real. /r/eve is all horrible ideas disguised as amazing shitposts.
---
Every jump you take

Every drone you make

Every dread' you break

I'll be watching you.
---
What ended up happening with this?
---
That is quick~ right after da kill. Video is out
---
Depends on what you consider massive volume. You can fit about 35 cruisers in a JF, so moving a ridiculous volume of cruisers to market in HS from NS may or may not compete with what local producers in HS can produce due to fuel costs and opportunity costs. 
---
I have a feeling that most of the ships you see sold in HS were manufactured there. I think that the monthly economic report supports that.
---
What is more likely the case is that the ore is imported and refined in high sec for high sec production as you can move much larger quantities of minerals in the form of compressed ore than you can in the form of items. Eg, 350k m3 of compressed spod has a mineral value of nearly 5b isk, 350k m3 of cruisers has a value of about 240m. 
---
See you around, friend. Come buy for a visit once in a while! o7
---
What is  Anoikis ?
---
The classic BL definitely got their krab on
---
Ganking the endless unscouted gilas running Guristas missions out of K3JR was an old pastime of mine and taking sov in Fountain basically tore them apart
---
Also moon mining was basically krabbing with dreads until rather recently and pretty much every "relevant" NPC null / low org was to some degree a social club for moonkrabs specializing in the high-ends that were too annoying for the major null alliances to defend, BL was certainly no exception
---
I gotcha 
---
This was my experience when I had my first 100+ person fleet fight in low or null...either I got popped despite my best efforts or we routed them (aka warpoffs, kill stragglers).
---
I wish I got into EWAR or DPS instead of buying like 30 Atrons
---
You can't keep existing players forever. Apparently a small number will play for decades, but most people eventually get bored by even the best game. I think EVE was as good as it ever had been when I left. After 7 years, I just had enough of it and moved on.
---
I guess you could, though less interesting in some regards, have "who **assembled** this hull" as a property. Not particularly useful for regular small ships you buy disassembled anyway, but for bigger ships that aren't generally repackaged that often (Titans etc.), that could be cool. 
---

What he needs is not help, but a termination notice.
---
Technical nightmare.  Repackaged ships are a different item than an assembled ship, so making it retain unique information would be a pain in the ass and require the entire inventory system to be recoded.

The added test space is renting space in feyth which was previously rented to KWG but they didn‚Äôt pay the rent so yeah...

But the Judge doesn't care about your vote. He's got a vote plan with GSF that guarantees him a seat on the CSM.
---
No point in trying to argue with reddit sperglords.
---
Everyone with dotlan can see that it belonged to KWG which rented the region from us...
---
Reminds me of my first blop, where our bridger was reluctant because we weren't worthy enough...
---
I don't disagree. Was even thinking that as I typed it out. As I said earlier - it seemed like only an academic discussion. Unnecessary overhead for not enough payof. 
---
You are after http://miningop.com/evetimezone/?name=&amp;type=character&amp;killboard=zkill when it is not returning an API fail
---
It actually amuses me how contextless that discussion gets sometimes
---
You have one side that's earned probably the bulk of their alliance level incomes over the last decade from renting over half of sov null by system count to bots and RMTers, without shame and literally under the tickers [BOT] and [RMT], also they're still doing it
---
Then you tune into the shit-flinging on r/eve, and a lot of it is grr china bots grr goon bots, often from the very same dudes whose entire reality is like an infinite cascade of boulders rolling into an infinite subdivision of glass houses, and it's like... what?
---
I need all features rushed out before theyre tested though. Broken chat is the best change to the game in years.
---
Although I do wonder if it might be worth doing if they attached a plex price to it. say 50 plex or something to put a makers mark on an item which creates it as a unique database item, even if repackaged.  
---
obviously it wouldn't be worth doing for frigates or anything. but I might be willing to splurge the extra plex to put my stamp on every super/titan I sell. especially if you would get a lossmail notification if that ship ever dies, hell if it came with the notification I might even be willing to do it on some smaller ships just out of curiosity to see exactly where that particular ship ended up.
---
I will happily do the stood abyssal thingy nonsense, when they let me use the normal camera in there... 
---
A decent system can't support 6-8 supers. You'll see many more systems with supers as they spread out to try and negate the increased respawn timers.
---
why cant CCP have players write the lore as the game progresses? getting to know the "old days of eve" is almost an archiological progress where you real old derelict forum archives (scripts of old if you may) and watch crusty 144~240p videos (cave paintings) to piece together old eve    
---
CCP does not need a team of writers for lore, they need bookkeepers and archiologists to archive the happenings of 2003~now 
---
That's the way Eve used to be mate. Maybe we should go back to that way and stop pandering to the instant gratification-daddy's credit-brigade and stop inflation in the same hit?
---
umm.... wut
---
Now if you restricted super fax reps, you dont have any wh/carrier/dread problems. Basically you eliminate a lot of problems in the beginning. Titans can still be gangsters, supers can still wreak subs (battleships) but they arent immortal anymore in every medium alliance. Also why not deal with price?? Carrier is cheaper than poor fit marauder :| Suicide dread - 2b. Maybe increase cost to produce? Anyhow - supers not getting reps would be very much interesting
---
You fight with them not moving and drop sentrys?
---
You cannot assign them and you need to both lock and shoot with the rattle AND the drones, meaning tons of time to broadcast for reps.
---
That shit gets turned off pronto as soon as i reinstall. 
---
That's actually a good idea.
---
Oh so hard to press f1+f at a target, such individual piloting....
---
Also if you have time to broadcast with anything its going to be a rattle...
---
Thanks bro !silver
---
Love the story.
---
&gt;drops carrier on ~~Frigate~~ Egg
---
Flair checks out
---
I guess people would only bother with faction caps. Otherwise why would you increase your manufacturing costs? People wouldn't pay more for a ship with some random industry alt name on it. 
---
I don't think I have to address every single EVE player, this is basicly impossible... I would already be happy to address only the "FUN &gt; ISK" group.
---
Tri barely killed fcon with pl and NC helping them, and then lost their keepstar to DRF. Skills killed DRF.
---
What does "I seen" mean?
---
I was lead to believe that GigX was handling this problem, no?
---
thats actually a good point. Why no story? I think Quest is the better word to describe it, because new or even PVP inexperienced players would rather deter a challenge. Don't you think too?
---
I agree, ewar frigs like maulus or crucifier can shut down enemy support or disrupt their dps ships, and with their long range they can sit comfortably at 70-80k away and are also much easier to skill into than a decent ceptor. 
---
I'm really surprised we were able to do it. Hate it if the dude had an emergency but it's the game he plays. Best of luck on afking on a structure again 
---
And how do you plan to do that, is the question? It's a fair question you've been asked, but you're not addressing it.
---
How would one post a quest and know it won't be sniped by an alt-killer?
---
Thats why I figured adding a lossmail notification as well, and the relatively low plex price. 50 plex might be too high, maybe 10 plex or something would be better, just trying to think of a number that would be low enough that its not a "huge" deal to add it to a ship, but still high enough to be worth the extra database load.
---
wouldn't be something i'd do to increase the price, would just be something for my personal gratification, so would come out of my profit margins. 
---
Would be nice if the ship icons showed skins too if they had any at the time of the killmail
---
I feel like you might get better engagement if you make the rewards from a short and accessible quest, only accessible through many hours of grinding for materials, which cannot be obtained from a single region or a single activity... Maybe a blueprint that needs several hours of mining and explo to compete... 
---
Not really IMO. If the challenges were also shown with recommendations (like maybe based on average SP?) then players would be able to tell if something might be within their abilities or not; which would give some motivation to go through with it.
---
Just think quest implies that there is a plot of some sort. 
---
People would kill their alts to get the achievements which would make it completely meaningless. Eve being a truly open sandbox game has its negative sides. 
---
Because of the nature of the game the only true content can only come from other players. The more content creators there are the more fun Eve becomes. For me Eve circa 2013 was the pinnacle of fun. Huge amount of different cool content creators were playing the game and there was tons of stuff to do.
---
Trying to create content with these bounty styled mechanics won't work. Not in Eve at least.
---
Pretty sure they had a regular INIT. host on Xander's show. As well as a member of Zebra Corp which if memory serves correctly the site was originally named after (before Zebra Corp joined goons). I remember them as being pretty neutral overall.
---
By saying that players are the problem proves that u have no idea about the gaming industry. There is not players problem or isk faucet problem the problem is that ISK made by players are not a direct income of CCP. Among all gaming industry companies trying to monezie every player activity wich brings shitty unfinished games to the market. Nerfing supers, nerfing T3s, nerfing anomalies, nerfing faxes and basically making game less fun will not increase player base and make the game more competetive overall. 
---
I do a lot pvp i do super ratting i do roqual mining im buying PLEX sometimes for real currency and how come this change make me to like this game more if i have to spend more time on grinding unchanged anomalies that are not suitable for carriers. If they want to rebalance crabbing ccp shoud introduce new anomalies. I remeber the last nerf of supers - they announced it like 3d before releasing a patch not consulting it with players and after a shit storm on forums they nerfed it a bit less they planned - that‚Äôs not how you make game better. And the prove is unchanged player base for years.
---
First place i think you can't 100% prevent Alt-Killing in PVP. My first thought is not to accept Killmails from new Chars and the creation of a function to recognize players who kill the same characters over and over again. It could also be made more difficult by a special quest design "Fly to Delve in a Mining Barge and Kill 2 Goons" as an example, so you'd need an alt inside Goonswarm.
---
fix for afk ratting is freaking simple: npc without autoaggro
---
This calls for a space court
---
fuck off
---
Damn ... you know what this means? 
---
I would agree if the system sec status had nothing to do with quality and the number of sites. This mechanics makes players gather in most profitable systems and by further cutting anoms respawn rate won‚Äôt change it. The system sec status shoud me moderet and depend on player activities not a constant valuse. 3 havens in one system is not enough for one super to sustain respawnig and im not planning to switch for ex  to forlorn hubs from obvious reasons. So increasing frustration is not making game better and more competetive especially when you see around afk ratters all over the pockets.
---
&gt;"pvp at least once without an alt's"  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"do not carry ECM drones"
---
hardest challenge  right there
---
With the added consequence that the item can only be traded through direct trade or contracts. Afaik they wanted to add a better system to sort through abysal items but as so often that never happened. CCPls.
---
Surprised nobody dropped supers on you.
---
yeah what a RETARD he basically LOST the fight because he spent time pvping instead of BUILDING AN INDUSTRIAL BASE by MINING MORE 
---
The plex price can scale with size
---
You want either another mach fleet or nightmares, or rattle fleet
---
You can also take ab gilas and td frigs, you nwed enough dps to break the logi tho

That damage is already done, only thing you'd do is to fuck newer players. Nerfs to rorqs and capitals in general is a better solution.

Looks like he is 100km off the structure but still tethered...

if you're on a single account, don't waste your time doing stupid green anoms. You're better off running scannable combat sites or running escalations. Brave's public wiki has some fits and guides for Angel space: https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/dojo/wiki/ded-sites#ded_site_guides

Rorquals aren't the problem. Excavators are.
---
Just remove the ability for drones to auto agress. Your idea is fucking dumb and doesn't solve the issue at all.
---
I discussed this already with Katherinesilens before. There are mechaniks that will probably work but you can't 100% prevent this type of player. You can be sure, i won't support this and do everything to make it as hard as possible :)
---
1 Plex would be worth the database load. Question is, would they be willing to dabble in spaghetti for something that would be used by 0.00001% of players? Probably not, there‚Äôs plenty of places to spend CCP resources. 
---
The subtle art of CCP Whispering is a dying art, but there are some who can still decypher the arcane script from the 'Notes of Patch'
---
Flair checks out. 
---
Fcon absolutely crumbled, and that was with legacy and the Imperium and the DRF all dogpiling on that shit. Sov didn't instantly go, but the coalition's will to live did. Also Skill Urself fought DCU more.
---
Supported.
---
Really hope it's at least a slightly more secure process.
---
i agree . CCP needs to pay attention to that . its been very very long time 
---
Supported. 
---
How many Devs have to leave CCP due to your pure pressure, until you give up, Stain Guy?
---
This is even worse than the whole boot.ini fiasco!
---
Sums up my thoughts perfectly.
---
 
---
So sad to see Eve lose that edge it used to have. It was what set it apart from the rest of the market.
---
Finally get to see just how old that drake cache is
---
fgvhbjhknj wat?!
---
)))
---
Holy shit
---
I disagree, the only change capitals need is to slow down fighters.
---
As I said today rorquals made possible to everyone something that in past required tons of accounts, industrial production and serious mining.
---
The real problem about rorquals is the number of characters able to fly them, which is insane because of skill injectors.
---
Reduce the number or rorq pilots and mineral prices will raise to a normal level. Capital prices too.
---
Reduce the number of capital pilots and roaming will be easier, rorq defense more challenging and in the same time you will reduce isk inflation and insane botting revenues.
---
I'm not saying it's easy, the way I suggested is unpopular and will make a lot of people complain and whine, but with injectors the game is fucked up, CCP knows that and every experienced player knows that.
---
"The damage is already done and we can't turn back" is a bullshit, we only need the will to do what's need to be done... 
---
most eve players allready know how greedy ccp is just look up moncal gate 
---
Firstly just do havens tick rate is better.  Rock havens .
---
VNI really otherwise invest in a niddy.  
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

You should start a petition.

Wormhole space.

Imagine losing to banderlogs...

VNI or Ishtar can get 15m-18m\~ ticks  
---
Rattlesnake can get about 25m ticks  
---
Nidhoggur can get about 50m ticks  
---
Clone soldiers in 0.1-0.2 can be a steady income and can be easily run as alpha.
---
Sorry, skill injectors are fucking this game up bigtime. 
---
I never said git gud at all. I'm terrible and have been playing for a while. If you need to sit around for a year before you undock, maybe you should stop trying to be gud at everything and just focus on one thing? You've also just negated your argument against skill injectors when you say credit cards aren't how to win. Credit cards buy injectors which, in your opinion, allow a level playing field. 
---
Either you want skill injectors or you don't. Maybe you should make your mind up.
---
PS, it's too late to nerf rorqs and caps - everyone that wants them has them and nerfing them won't make them go away.
---
"Not on rails" means I Need to take some time to figure out what I want to do in the game.
---
I'm not really a Person to use comms either.
---
As for picking up a Group; so far I would watch them but stay away from them.
---
Holy Moly, I hadn't realised how close to completion you were on this! 
---
Congratulations Signaleer! 
---
Init fittings have come a long way in 2 years, then :D
---
Free HG slaves for everybody, too!
---
Yes, I get it. 
---
And I actually did work together with other Players in other games successfully and while having fun. Yet, I still feel better most of the time playing on my own.
---
I guess its "adapt or die" in a way... Its not like we don't have any blogs, news channels, twitch talk shows, podcasts about EVE. We have quite a lot of those actually. I'm not too familiar with CZ affairs and what they have been writing, but if the author says he is basically the only active writer left and they had a hard time recruiting more writers, that kinda shows that there are some other issues there, because we see other active sources growing (e.g. TIS, NER), which means that there are active people out there willing to do these kinds of things...
---
Maybe people are less interested in reading, but more interested in podcasts? I don't know.
---
There are a lot of combat sites that are pants and only a few relatively worth doing. In highsec your first choices would be DED-rated 3/10 and 4/10, followed by maybe Refuges (to get 4/10 escalations) and Dens (to get 5/10 escalations). Unrated drone complexes (Desolate Site, Chemical Yard) can be also decent for a chance of Sentient drops and astero chips (45M a pop). 
---
The real money starts in lowsec. Come visit sunny Khanid.
---
Stain does not have a LS gate to it as it does not border LS, simple as that , its the same w/ impass, esoteria and detorid to mention a few http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map
---
I could get behind this 
---
For the most part, Cosmo manages to describe it in his section near the start. The older players who wrote for us had already said their part and the new players didn't know who we were. We certainly had a lot of podcasts, but losing that "star power" over time meant less and less big names to look forward to reading.
---
You're right that there were some other issues, though. Niden pretty much disappeared for example. With him gone we were without the editor in chief and without some of the drive that kept people writing. Cosmo stepped into his shoes but over time sorta tapered off as did the content. I kind of ran things towards the end, but by that point we only had a few remaining writers putting pieces out.
---
How is that possible if you can stack them? Which one off the stack is used when you assemble one?
---
Im torn on this. On one hand I want it so that stain people can roam the greener pastures of lowsec and leave stain empty and deprived of content. On the other hand /r/eve deserves your posting, and what would you post about after that?
---
What would be a good ship and fit to work up to, to do level 3 security missions?
---
Right now the only engaging PvE is Abyss and to an extent burners. Burners are old and solved content, but one mistake and your ships a gonner, ships are still being lost on them plenty. L4s etc. are ok **if** and only if you are still underskilled. Once you hit level 5 skills its easy peasy. But, then again L4 income is fairly balanced per time invested at least cause it's not exactly great.
---
I think they should give all anoms Abyss style AI, spawns, etc. Instead of rooms just have waves with some loot can at the end of each wave with like a minute in between spawns. Have each wave go up in difficulty, this way lower skileld players can just warp out after a couple waves while someone more advanced would stay. 
---
Also switching income from bounties to lootcans, kinda like overseers thingies etc., enables better and more loot can shenanigans, more content.
---
Wholeheartedly agree, if these changes are good for the economy im totally cool with it
---
Hehe, I miss being out in NullSec making more money and playing properly, but Imma wait for summer before I get hooked on space cocaine again... But what kind of places would I look for those sites, is it just that lower security systems = better sites? 
---
Yeah, so its also a bit an issue with the brand name and image - vets know it very well, newer people not so much. Sadly the number of vets who remember the old days are decreasing, sooo does the popularity of a site. Eventually you have to change with the times or you might end up as "remember that old page we used to have years ago, where vets talked about the good old days?"
---
The population of EVE changes, its a normal process and in order for newer people to know what is CZ and also like it, you have to eventually change up some things. Yes, that might include sacrificing some of the original concept...
---
Don‚Äôt ride the coattails of my good comment for your shitty spam. 
---
They need to do a lot of stuff with them. Make the gameplay engaging, spread them out over much wider area, gating won't work cause same multiboxers and botters will just come in their own personal fleets so it will solve nothing except keep regular people out.
---
Denied. 
---
Yes buff bots that's a good boy.
---
[there is already a lowsec gate to stain](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/Toustain) 
---
That's better than my rookie fail first outing in lowsec. Warped to gate to chase, they were just sitting at the gate, light em up, die to gate guns... Forgot gate guns still shoot in low. 
---
If you get your gate, will you delete your reddit account and stop using r/eve?
---
Sounds like a personal problem if you will stick your nose up to other anoms.

Go live in lowsec then, or syndicate
---
Yep, I definitely wanted to find that solution. I tried for a while to get people writing again and bring things back, but it's a labour of love that needs a team. Part of why I stopped properly trying after a while was because I knew that if I got too invested on my own then the performance of the site would affect my mental health. I get too attached to how well things are going and probably would have blamed myself for every minute that went by without an article :P
---
Last I checked Kestrels were like 2 mil each and still did relativley well. You can pimp one out for like 12 mil kitey fit.
---
Nah he still wants to know your location
---
did you mean "the navy issue" ?
---
Did relatively well against what? Because almost everything that comes through GE- would alpha a kestrel right off grid.
---
I believe one or both of them have said before they have the notifications turned off, I hope I'm wrong however and this get's the attention it actually deserves
---
I disagree greatly. Caps and Supers need to all be put on the balance line, get rid of the cliff while limiting injectors from working on cap skills and their direct requirements.
---
Maybe if we all pitch in and buy new hamsters and ship them to ccp‚Äôs door. Maybe that‚Äôs the way to get some QoL improvements done
---
have you read it ? Does it engage you to pay CCP and let them have access to all your private life ? No.
---
If you can read, you'll understand that EULA is safe for your privacy, as long as you do not put personnal or illegal stuff into the game.
---
supported
---
This applies to some regions, that still have a gate:
---
Saminer =&gt; 9.946 ly =&gt; T-NNJZ no gate
---
Konora =&gt; 13 ly =&gt; N-RAEL =&gt; gate
---
Paala =&gt; 16 ly =&gt; LXQ2-T =&gt; gate
---
Keberz =&gt; 23 ly =&gt; HED-GP =&gt; gate
---
So, like, in Anarchy Online?  
---
While this sounds cool, I suspect the Eve engine with make those items unstackable 
---
You guys are rude. His face looks friendly, funny. i like it.
---
I bet noone of you got the ballz to present an EvePulse, just for the lulz reddit will make of your face.
---
Valid if you don't respect your enemy
---
Machariel Fleets are typically arty fit, and like all large Fleets, FCs generally call a Primaty in order to Alpha said target to oblivion. Artillary excel at Alphaing.
---
With the new changes to ECM the jammed target can only lock and fire at the person targeting them.
---
If, for example, you have a fleet of 25 machs vs 25 of these arty scorpions, and (hypothetically) each of those scorpions successfully jammed a mach 1:1,
---
Then the enemy fleet would not be able to alpha anything, but the scorpions still could.
---
Problem solved, I'd say.
---
Maybe send the info over when the sale is made. The code knows who bought and who sold the item. 
---
headshotting in some random fun fight is meh. headshotting for a strategic objective is a valid tactic.
---
Title is lies, there was more than bumping involved in this kill. Was hoping CCP had secretly enabled death-by-firey-orb and this was a video of someone punting a super into a star.
---
Yes you right if your objective is to remove or evict a fleet/corp/alli.
---
Personnaly i never headshot when it is consented fight from both side.
---
I call that "respect" but in the world of blob alliances, that word don't exist i guess
---
lol
---
Won't be the only hole hurting after that fight. 
---
how come no one has built a ans anus anisub anisubliex, meh you know what i mean one of the player built gate pairs?
---
I am fine with all of that but the last point.
---
But do you win more when you plex more? If you're still bad at the game all that plex value will just be on someone else's killmail.
---
Could somebody explain this to me? I‚Äôm kinda new around here, but I‚Äôve seen this stainguy nag about gates quite often... 
---
Don't mind the eve snowflakes 
---
~~By lucky coincidence~~

&gt; By lucky CSM leaks

FTFY friend.

cant monetise it as easily
---
Director
---
Thanks, lets see if itll be roasted gula tonight
---
They redeployed to Fountain to defend some sov timers, a few days ago.
---
If CCP did such a bad job retaining existing players then why is this game full of dudes that have played the game for like 7+ years and manages to stay afloat for basically forever?
---
Implants have nothing to do with ships my dude
---
I can't believe you've done this.
---
Thats probably the greatest accomplishment in EVE.
---
No. If the gate is added, your quality shortlisting will stop. That's one reason against it already.
---
im pretty sure a standing ovation at fanfest 17 was a pretty good reason to impliment logi on KM    
---
also you cant monetize holo banners on caps? just make it a "skin accessory" the more you pay, the more banners and bling 
---
People only need to VNI rat and shit because of the meme that eve is free. You spend most of your time VNI ratting to avoid paying for the game, but if you do pay and leave the shitty null sec power blocs, VNI ratting is unnecessary and enjoyment shoots up dramatically.
---
&gt;2 carriers on field  
---
&gt;plus more subcaps  
---
&gt;still a 60/40 BR   
---
im suprised TNT is still alive 
---
because it requires ihub ownership
---
Yeah, let's not use the "official" means that we have to bring up requests for new features. Let's write "official" in reddit because that should do it.  
---
\-- Logic
---
probably didnt have mumble keys setup properly to speak up to fc channel
---
OP suggested it like maybe a half-hour ago, not years.
---
CCP need to connect the east with the west, the south with the north, as a sphere universe, it would be really more fun.
---
It's cool to have more opensource tools. Keep it up ! 
---
but what about Venal?
---
In before CCP puts it up on the ccplease site with never or some unrealistically long date
---
I'm not 100% convinced, mainly because I don't see the relevance of the Stain region. Could you maybe elaborate on this and provide a more in-depth analysis why you think it would be beneficial to build a lowsec gate connection? After all, this requires a lot of money and resources to do and I'm sure that most of that could be invested into other regions as well, which are in dire need of infrastructure and overall gate maintenance.
---
Haha that's entirely possible, but less funny than Seddow just ignoring him.
---
Official request to not do this to piss off Stain guy
---
Your posts are bad, people who like your posts are bad and there will never be a lowsec gate to Stain.
---
How I can get a list or otherwise know which systems in a region are cyno jammed?
---
Does Dotlan have any function to automatically avoid those systems without inserting them one by one?
---
A battle cruiser, like a myrmidon or a brutix.
---
Eh why not, you've gone on and on about this for so long I think you deserve it. 
---
Stainguy is the elite shitposter, has been begging for a lowsec gate to stain since the collapse of the eve gate. His nagging and shitposting escalates to such a level, that the devs in fact did make a lowsec gate to stain, except it is just not tangible/visible in the game. I think is was mentioned in some comment by stainguy.
---
No
---
Ohhhh right, explains the name ‚Äústainguy‚Äù just realized lol. 
---
So the devs actually got annoyed and trolled him by making an invisible gate?
---
Switch to PvP on the weekends!
---
Stain is a nullsec region in the South that is only accessible via nullsec - Period Basis, Esoteria and Catch to be exact. StainGuy wants there to be a lowsec gate to Stain and talks quite a bit about it
---
It won't be attacked straight away, but bet on getting a war sec at some point. For a solo player, it really probably isn't that viable because if it us attacked, you're either 1) gunna loose it or 2) pay some merc Corp an exuberant amount of isk to defend it and lose isk in the process. 
---
Further, you need to realize that logistics if keeping it fueled. If you decide you wanna make all your own fuel blocks, thats all you're going tobhave time to do with 1 character; chase pi and mine ice. 
---
Don't think for a minute that station defenses will save you. Especially on something medium or smaller. Even, if you had something big enough to field fighters, they can be pretty easily defanged. 
---
So, if you wanna spend the isk to get it started correctly, get it deployed, and spend half your time making fuel for something that can be pretty easily destroyed, go for it. If not, find some chill guys in null who already have infrastructure set up, and go make some real isk, with less risk. 
---
I bet the problem is not keeping info of a packed ship, but the problem is what happens afterwards - unnecessary strain on the systems to store/retrieve all that info.
---
Falcon is very happy and remains by his own will; just the other day Falcon mentioned, of his own volition, how he was free to leave at any time.
---
Wow that's impressive ! Never knew about that.
---
CCP should reward her (him?).
---
But please, PLEASE Signal Cartel ! Stop droping cans in our system. I'm getting bored of destroying them.
---
I think it would be cool, but tbh a "ship builder" is just someone who puts the parts together, that might as well just been purchased at a cheap price - so what exactly did that guy do to earn the right to put his name on a ship when everything else down the supply chain was provided by hard working people?
---
Also: in a corp, one dude could be just pressing that one button but contribute zero to the entire process, while others who have collected resources, built all the parts, did the research, etc. are not mentioned at all? Kind of unfair imho.
---
I think what would be a lot more adequate would be just the corp name. That way, everyone get's the honors who is part of that entity. It would be more realistic as well, e.g. products have company/manufacturer names on them not single person's names.
---
That would be a compromise I could live with, even though it does not include all the suppliers of all the parts - because I think that would make it much more interesting and potentially increase interest in certain products if parts of them (or all of it) comes from a certain corp. And that way, the contribution of small corps that specialized in certain industries would also be recognized properly.
---
you forgot this every 3 lines

What, you have a PhD in Spaghetti Coding?
---
Stargates don't grow on trees. We don't have the budget i tell ya! we need to cut Stargates! BUILD A WALL AROUND STAIN
---
Might as well go all the way and make it a high sec gate to stain.
---
The sec status of where you open them has no impact on the loot tables.
---
Alphas can run up to T4 filaments
---
Comparing C1 WH content to T1 Abyssal loot tables was setting up for a bad time :)
---
The dream: being able to copy those notes between alts...
---
I think highsec gankers would love that
---
My advice would be fly a heron to deep sansha space for a night, be careful, hack all safe relic sites and come back with 1,5b to buy omega. If you don't feel comfortable for so long do 3 Trips a 500m, this should still be doable in one night.

As someone who lives next door to Stain...no. Do not want. There is enough content coming from there into our space.

you mean your 652nd official request? Right, got it.
---
I see, but is there a specific reason why this is so important to him? I‚Äôve never seen nobody else complain about that lol
---
The bar exam doesn't have a "Call a goon" option dipshit. Try again with that retarded logic lmao. 
---
&gt; But no one outside of your autistic echo chamber falls for it. So keep on responding to people you know you're not fooling in the off chance one of your minions comes across it so they'll keep on pressing f1 :)
---
Except than for goon they will rent period basis. So it wont be for the goon kraab.
---
It's pretty much a meme at this point
---
In this case, this is evidence of a wall actually working. It doesn't stop his shitposting unfortunately.
---
Yes you did a great job bringing your own ideas to the table! Well contributed!
---
and you think they haven't blocked you by now. You poor summer child.
---
thank Bob for this
---
make jita low sec instead 
---
I hope there is a lowsec gate to stain in the future just to show you up ;)
---
it would take down about 73% of all shitposting on r/Eve 
---
FC wat do?
---
Right. Because buffing every other form of pve instead of just nerfing anoms makes sense.
---
no there has to be an equal number of shitholes to balance the map
---
please god no, not you too.
---
Oh god, what a can of worms that would open up... It'd be awesome.
---
Calm down corpmate üòä just rolling with the winds
---
I disagree with your assessment of the capital meta.
---
As far as having to put forward your own ideas.  This is wrong.  You do not have to have your own ideas to see a bad one.  It is like the "Green New Deal", I don't have to have my own climate proposal to know that it is utter shit.
---
So yes, please come back when you have a touch bit of knowledge on the capital meta subject and are not just willy-nilly making really dumb comments.
---
Faxes only repping subcaps?  Dumbest idea ever.  You specifically state that you don't want capitals to be able to apply to subcaps, then have a capital apply to a subcap.  
---
Your attempts to have capitals be shoehorned into a certain role, given their price, is asinine.  Should my Hel be able to smoke the shit out of your 250mil ISK fleet?  You are damn straight it should.
---
Now, before you falsely claim that they are overpowered and the only way to kill them is with other capitals, that is wrong.  Subcaps kill capitals and supercapitals, and have far fewer ISK on the field while doing so.
---
Yes, i fell fir her officer mod scam back in 2011...i didnt know about volume buy order trades and lost my very 1st billion isk that i grinded for in pve
---
you need to define ''alive'' tho
---
I endorse this product and or service. Anyone dumb enough to afk on a structure in a super deserves to lose it.
---
o7
---
&gt;So I'm running an Alpha account at the moment - generally to see just how much I can make.  
---
&gt;I thought I would try these Abyssal sites - yes I'm late to the party but had heard tales of good loot.  
---
&gt;So just ran a lowest level Calm Exotic site, which I must admit I did not realise how bad the drone aggro was.  
---
&gt;All in all I got 2.5 million of loot and pretty much lost that in drones and repairs.  
---
&gt;Now as an Alpha - in a lower time space I can run a C1 wormhole site and make 10-15 million without fail.  
---
&gt;So what is the point of these Abyssal sites - are they pretty much gated to Omega accounts only? ie Not worth it as an Alpha?  
---
&gt;TBH if my experience for the calm sites is the norm then that makes it worse isk per hour than mining in a venture in Hisec - lol
---
Tier 1 and 2 Abyss sites are for very new players. Also, if you lose drones in Abyss that is 100% on you and your lack of drone management skills.
---
As an alpha, but an alpha using daily injectors with 20 mil SP, you can train up a Gila or Phantasm for T3 Abyss. Some minor bling required, specifically faction DPS mods, prop mod, and maybe a C-Type module or two, to make up for lower level of skills that are capped at 4s instead of 5s, and specialization skill caps for Alphas.
---
T3s will get you around 40 mil per hour, this is of course assuming you don't run just the expensive filaments (exotic, gamma) and actually learn mechanics etc. Stop losing your drones. 
---
You can even do T3s in a VNI, but that requires more bling, can get really expensive. Also to give you some perspective, I haven't lost a drone in Abyss in over 3 months. I've lost two ships though, lost a Sac in a T5 Dark and a Gila in a T4 when I got a socket closed and disconnected. Didn't make it back in time and subsequent 2 rooms had battleships in them, didn't make the timer cause of the disconnect.
---
&gt; wardec exploits
---
Been away for a while, but from the email I just got it looks like it has nothing to do with exploits, and just protects people from pvp?
---
Could just be that the FC was communicating/have lot of chatter on global or command, where FC's voice lowers the volume of line members automatically. Happens more often than people think.
---
^(Or maybe the line member could fucking ask the question instead of saying "FC". Or just use fleet chat to sperg.)
---
Why do you feel the need to insult someone, if you don't even have ideas or anything to contribute of your own? That makes mine better by default, because even a bad idea can lead to positive discussion, although perhaps not with you, since you apparently default to insults rather than discussion. 
---
At least you've finally put some effort into a single post, after about 6-8 posts purely insulting me, while downvoting as well (learn your rediquette, downvotes are for offtopic posts, such as your insults). But tbh it's a bit late - I'm kinda done taking insults every post from you, so I'll just block and move on.
---
As if the afk-vni's are really the big problem on the isk-making-scale, it's more the super/titan ratting but believe the vnis are the big problem...
---
Just use Abyss AI, change cosmetics, maybe ship types will be different. Use some EWAR like occasional web + paint, scram, neuts. Or jsut pop one of those cruise missile towers that shoot up to 160+ km, if a VNI is AFK it will get blown away, if not it can come in and take it out instead. Many things can be done.
---
Any changes?
---
do highsec incursions
---
I had an idea over a decade ago that industrial corps should be able to modify their BPOs to produce more unique versions of items/ships. I think this was pre-rig times though, but the idea of a builder corp's logo on ships always stuck with me as quite nice extra bit of fluff for people to investigate/be proud of/laugh at.. etc.
---
Along with a storefront for industrial corps to push their unique/preferred designs it definitely would have added elements of reputation for industrial corps. \[FYI: the contract system was originally touted by CCP devs as a possible method for corp stores but this sadly never got developed any further - like many decent ideas probably for the required coding and difficulty to integrate it properly as you suggested\].
---
Awww, I must have struck a nerve.  
---
Here is a reddiquette tip for you.  Don't come in here with dumb ideas and expect to not get called out on them. 
---
Sure i spend 10min fly arround the grid to pick up loot.. Over and over again the same stupid solution.. Why we dont just patch anoms out of the game? Would at least have the same effect... 
---
this is a good post
---
A new donut place opened up in my town. I don't really like sweet things that much, but the signage on the front of the store had a really delicious looking croissant sandwich, so I think I'll drop by at some point to check it out.
---
Eve mail and wait. Worked for one buddy now we‚Äôre back  running around together
---
Exactly. Afk VNI ratters are nothing compared to bot super ratters. 
---
Yeah, gating them is a great idea, especially since that makes one more warp before you can catch the ship that's in the anom.
---
Afk ratting does not need to be fixed. Botting carriers, supers and Rorquals does.
---
Elo decided to bot as well?
---
If I ever start streaming EVE again this is becoming an emote. 
---
This is the biggest issue imho. Unless there is a better solution to avoid such exploits, any change is just wasted effort.
---
I'm no expert in databases but if it were SQL for example I would have thought they could add a column to any item tables with "corp\_ID" which corresponds to the unique ID when you create a new corp, without too much trouble.
---
But perhaps yeah that would add too many entries in the tables where previously "repackaged" only takes up one entry - I dunno. Worth an ask though.
---
Yeah coz hard wires don't exist
---
The amount of isk from ratting has decreased significantly, and will probably continue to lower with the incoming changes. Which is good.
---
The total amount of isk in the game has lowered by about 50T, which could be related to bans. Sadly it's still increasing pretty strongly for some reason.
---
Yeah, at this point I'm just hoping he is on a vacation.
---
yet here you crow about a medium pos. op success.
---
Yeah took about a month. I wish you good luck 
---
It can't be done. Long range webs were added to stop people doing it.
---
The thing about Eve is if you‚Äôre not enjoying one specific thing, you could switch gears and do something else. There is no barrier to entry besides skills (in-game skills and actual capabilities) which is the same for most games. Once you find something you enjoy or something you‚Äôre good at, you could exploit that in so many ways. 
---
I'd recommend the Drake, escpecially if you are a rather unexperienced pilot. It features a great tank and doesn't require the active management of Cap. Basicly: Lock, Shoot, Warp &amp; Mission complete.
---
It will be able to complete even harder L3 Missions with relative ease (with some higher skills even L4s, this can be teadious though).
---
As already requested the Myrmidon works as well (don't like the Brutix much for missions tbh), it can fly massive DPS with just Drones at a great range, this requires some decent skills in the Drone Field though, also a passive tank is harder to achieve- I'd say if you have decent skills in that field you can give it a shot.
---
Some L3s can also be run with Cruisers if you feel brave and have good skills and an advanced understanding of sigtanking/speedtanking, though I'd not recommend it for starters.
---
For the Drake a downgraded version of the Drake I posted before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aycexi/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_march_07/ei3p7ll/?context=3) can be used. (all of T2 changed to Meta 4 if you don't have the skills)

---
I want a mechanic like concord to protect all pink star placed structures. Some things are just too pretty and should never get blown up. :)
---
Imho, there should not be any rewards except bragging rights.
---
The prospect of getting something exciting to do would be sufficient for people who are really looking forward to  it, and the no-reward thing would drive 'cheaters' away. You can always award 'fame' points for every accomplishments, for e-penis bragging rights. Basically the World of Warcraft Achievements system! 
---
I would also not go for "Kill X of alliance Y", otherwise you will soon end-up in Null politics and that is not what you want. I would even go as far as remove that option from the user created quests. 
---
My 2 cents to the piece, 
---
* Daily quests are a proven system, same mission offered to everyone at the same time.
---
* Leaderboards, each completed quests granting a certain number of 'Fame Points' (Monthly top, yearly top, etc etc).
---
* I really dig the idea, if people are willing, of having 'PVP tutorial' quests, giving a fit, explanations and a goal to drive beginners into PVP.
---
* Allow users to either browse quests by ship type, activity type, region, etc etc.
---
* Quest randomizer, you press a button and are given a quest to complete (give extra fame points if you complete the random quest).
---
* Events can be a thing: A set of 12 feats to be achieved, first one to complete them gets fame points
---
* Have a quest asking for someone to take a low-sec gate to Stain, or any eqster egg like that will help with the popularity :D
---
Keep us posted if you move forward with that, I would really be interested to try it out!
---
Quick, put it on /r/photoshopbattles
---
those are some pretty foul smelling winds.
---
Replying to bookmark for later. 
---
Thanks for the update, big ben.
---
Have you ever looked at the MER? Lifetime isk jn eve is unceasing by 10% a month. What‚Äôs going to make people quit is the realization that their hard work is meaningless. 
---
Erm, rats use Ewar already.
---
INIT should just move a dread cache to [TCAG-3](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/TCAG-3). It is one jump from being able to drop on most of Esoteria if they want to kill come Test supers/rorquals. 
---
1.5b in one night?
---
Well I do relics and datas in a C1 at the moment and even with blue loot from killing sleepers first I get 12 to 15 mil a site.
---
Still, I'll give it a look - think I still might have a clone out there somewhere.
---
Good point! That combined with a properly set up EC makes hauling hulls instead of ore a bit useless
---
You cannot have those in NPC areas also ranges are to big.     
---
The only route from lowsec to Stain is  Saminer =&gt; 9.946 ly =&gt; T-NNJZ and JF have max range of 10LY, while player made gate is 5LY. 
---
Some of us have 80m+ sp on our mains so can't inject as we only get 150k so per injector, for people like me who strive to train everything they are a god send.
---
Yeah, the math for them really splits after you get 80m SP
---
Loyalty Points plus ISK? for a squad of NPC random EAFs to come be a nuisance. but yeah would get abused and require too many mechanics/dev time to reduce abuse and also be viable.
---
I actually thought this the other day as a way of stopping/reducing supercap proliferation but the tears from people losing superblobs to a player spawned NPC superblob counter would put Iceland underwater.
---
Nah. Frat's just getting more western PvPers so the bots can run 24/7.
---
I don't know especially that some reddit mod decided to hide this thread. 
---
Good info.
---
Yep, did'nt research enough before trying and hence knew nothing about the random clouds of drone cancer, coupled with the aggro. did not realise using a drone boat in these meant constantly micro managing the drones.
---
was trying to get a decent cheap alpha fir at first to get comfy with these things so tried a Vexor and a thorax. Not lost one yet but both were too slow really. Think the Vexor might have been easier but it did ger easier sites.
---
Was looking at trying a Caracal next and get used to it and  build some isk up before going Navy or Hacs.
---
I can see me getting quite into this - different ships for different sites etc, thing is being old and bitter I've sunk isk into lots of projects in game like this - only for CCP to hit them with a nerf bat usually just before they start paying out lol.
---
Do you have a fit recommendation? I have a good amount of drone skills skilled up already. Currently at Drones V. From the looks of it I could use it in 6 hours. 
---
I Wish I knew.
---
Contact Igaze in game with your request and we'll see what we can work out!
---
If you cannot beat them? Join them!              
---
^bots
---
As long as I can keep my 30 vnis. üòä
---
That's a lot of sunk isk in one month. Sounds like bans. Could there be anything else significant attributable to it?
---
Whatever, gotta pay the bills right? 
---
No money for a gate. But enough cash to build a spherical wall around stain 
---
A few very rich players being considered inactive 
---
It is fun if the reward is as nice as the risk took.
---
But if you want to know my opinion :
---
Wormhole space is the quest i love. Everyday is a new one, with new objective and new risks.
---
The only thing to do is scanning, you can find pve, hunting areas for expected or unexpected pvp, abandoned/lootable structures or defended systemes.
---
Just make a capital escalation for every null sec annom just like in wormhole space. Ans the npc that Will spwan Will dry out scram Web your super and apply 5k dps on it having 1,5 m ehp, even resist and no bounty on it. 
---
Came here to share this, but you got it covered thoroughly Radio :) 
---
It's a question that has popped up at fanfest a few times over the years, and the explanation you gave paraphrases pretty much exactly what they said.
---
We like to note that this thing seen in the background while he made this totally free-willed statement has been a microphone and not a Walther PPK.
---
How much $ were FRT's CEO paid to ELO?
---
Well, that depends how many HP a roid would have...
---
Did they nerf highsec incursions and Rorq mining, too? Because being mad about anoms is so 2010.
---
CZ's articles were arguably some of the most well -thought out and documented sources of applicable game mechanics reference PvP and FW that I have ever read.
---
Like most sites, I didn't have a hand in most of the articles, but the very structure of the articles and the research processes involved were consistently well-planned and well stated.
---
Don't forget about the reinforced Astra!
---
What the fuck did you actually just type. This must be a bot.
---
Evil thoughts in my sleep-deprived brain: Make special ammo that "poisons" roids, making them stay there but be worthless yieldwise. PPL needa mine them anyways if they wanna flip the cluster...
---
Looks like a lot of sarcasm meters are broken. Have an up for the chuckle.
---
Lmao Elo can you be more pathetic? 
---
I'd love to see them release the per capita and per type of faucet data. Something tells me that (at least on per capita) anoms aren't a big issue.
---
The change won't affect me much as I can make more in an hour doing explo about 75% of the time and still get similar isk per hour when rng is treating me badly.
---
Seddow is the fc that lost a titan and tried to get it reimbursed by CCP by lying right? 
---
Things we have been asking for:
---
Ship attributes from birth to death
---
Things you get:
---
Ship balances
---
??? structures 
---
more spod
---
Alex Jones is informed!
---
Well all that coke will get paid by itself 
---
One opened in my town but i never got the time to go check it out and then it closed :(
---
Sounds impossible to do. If only there were a way to put data in sort of a base. Like a data-base. Where you could hold the attribute of an entity. It could even hold data if it were packed or assembled. Maybe the client would just read the assembled attribute and count the total and display that. Nahhh but thats impossible. That technology doesn't exits.
---
&gt; Test added entire new regions to their sov a couple of weeks back
---
I can't rat or explore there, so it's not like having them helps ratting isk generation.
---
INIT deployment really making an impact!
---
This is a great idea, it would give new Bros a sort of guide that they could learn from. This could evolve with the player as they gain more and more skill points. Which would keep it from getting boring because there would always be some goal or cool mission to shoot for. I think if it became widely known it would greatly increase solo and small gang pvp and the amount of players participating in pvp.
---
I had an egg and bacon sandwich from a petrol station. It was surprisingly not terrible and expensive. I expect to die soon from petrol station sandwich related complications.
---
Wasn't Elo unironically trying to run for CSM for like 3 days in a row campaigning against Delve bots? 
---
Giant :thinking: is due. 
---
If you can't beat the bots join them?
---
replying to remind you you have a bookmark here :\^)
---
Took you 12 hours
---
he realised botters can vote too
---
Delve mining at 11.1 trillion and rstting bounties at 11.8 trillion. Good amount of decrease compared to previous months and a massive drop from the all time highs reached last year. Could mean that the anomaly respawn time nerfs are having an affect. 
---
So what do we call this now, Black Fraternity? Frat Legion? Black Winter Legion?
---
Thanks to all that attended the viking funeral in Lantorn, throwing ships in and letting them explode.
---
That's fair enough, but would the scorps even be capable of getting their Arties to shot to the range the Machs would be, or even close enough of the damage to alpha the Machs? I guess getting them to retreat is just as much a win as killing them though.
---
When did the anom effects took Place?
---
probably because of "Millions of ORE mined every day" is kind of CCP statement which way this game is going?
---
Perhaps you'll become smarter and stronger?
---
Well, since it's a corp joining an alliance, I think just Fraternity would be perfectly accurate.
---
super is doing one anom around 3-5mins if am not mistaken, topping tick around 160mio, I bet you can't get 150m every 20min from explo, you can be lucky, but not constantly.
---
I build all my own ships so that the‚Äôir free
---
If I have an Omega account now with 10M SP and I let it lapse in to an Alpha state, how do I know what SPs will remain for use within the 5M SP limit?
---
Yeah but then he'll have to kill the worms to see if its him or the worms his crush loves.
---
I tried Burger King for the first time. I am not impressed.
---
6 months of botting and rmt and they hire BL?
---
Besides, who does even repackage capitals anyway?
---
Frack Legion
---
Any skill (or skill level) not locked behind Omega will still be available to use even if you lapse into Alpha.
---
To the best of my understanding, the limit isn't imposed on the SP count, but the level available on specific skills. It's just coincidental that those skills happen to total approx. 5M. What will happen in fact is that you won't lose only any SP, you'll only be unable to "use" the skills you've train beyond those available to an Alpha. Once you re-PLEX/SUB, they will unlock again. 
---
I'd like a Skin Falcon Face for my Rorqual!  Ccp please.
---
You‚Äôre as special as they come. What makes them safer to move now than before? This is what happens when noobs sit in end game ships. No understanding what so ever and they think their is a sure ‚Äúsafe‚Äù way to move a super. IDGAF what you do. Go end up on snuff killboard so i can laugh harder than ever.
---
P.S, if people are losing JF as safe as they are. What makes you think you can move a super even safer? If you don‚Äôt understand what i mean by this or the ‚Äúwhat makes them safer now than before‚Äù comment than stfu caz your noob AF.
---
I think I lost my last exhumer back then in Querious when I ve been a brandnew null-bro with no clue at all. srsly, if you catch an exhumer in some halfway srs null-group you know you found the guy who runs afk, or just passed out. As long as ppl just read their fokking intel-channels and act accordingly you ll never catch a humer. Yeaaaah, with the rare exception you coming through a WH and find one directly in system AND manage to find and tackle it before he reacts to neuts in local.  
---
Just accept that a well-fitted/flown Rorqual under the protection of a fast-forming defense-fleet is no valid target for a small gang. It just isnt. Like, dunno, a smartbombing battleship is no target for 5 brawling-frigs or a milkshake is no good drink for a lactose-intollerant.  
---
I guess the target of choice for small gangs these days is VNIs. Rather easy to kill, often running full-AFK and there is just craploads of them. Or other ratting-boats up to BSes. Or Orcas/Porpses eveeeentually, though to those applies what applies to exhumers: You dont catch them if they know what they re doing or you re very lucky.
---
You gotta sleep sometimes 
---
The diplos would never allow it
---
I've been thinking about the same thing too for a while. Include builder and a serial code unique for each ship. Make them easily exportable from buildlist somehow and add it to killboards. Then make a service so you can track the destruction of said serial numbers.
---
Think how cool it would be when someone steals a super/titan and it dies in the future, and it can be tracked back to the theft. Or see who builds all the botting supers. ;) Endless amounts of fun.
---
The only sucky part is the whole stacking/repackaging which doesn't really easily allow it without a (major?) code overhaul. It's probably still doable. Maybe only add it to capital ships and remove stacking from them.
---
I for one, would love to see who built my (capital) ships. CCPlease...
---
You can do solo.
---
At the moment me and 2 others own a station so it's not required to be part of a big group.
---
Plenty of people play mostly solo but you do have to be aware of other players. Most of the people in an exploration channel I'm in play mostly solo and just chat to others doing solo activity.
---
That said it's better if you and a couple others work towards a goal together. 
---
Hypocrisy
---
op shares super kill vid but not the kn reee  
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75632719/ 
---
&gt;then use the Tech 2 variants that are relatively free. You have choice.
---
You have no idea what you re talking about, right?
---
Too bad it's deleted now.
---
I think unassembled ships are generic items, much like NPC commodities, special edition items, etc. They just have a name, a volume and a couple more attributes, and can be sold. Assembled ships have stats, fitting, HP, etc. 
---
That would explain why modules need to be "assembled", because they are generic items when not assembled, and ships can only fit modules, not generic items.
---
As eve was originally coded in a language that uses object oriented programming (python), that would make the most sense.
---
What can I say? I hate botters.
---
Scorpion jam range exceeds the machariel falloff range. They have similar optimal ranges. The scorpion fleet could alpha machs faster than individual machs could kill individual scorpions.
---
just remove local
---
it's called risk versus reward
---
no risk
---
no reward
---
&gt; Question is, would they be willing to dabble in spaghetti for something that would be used by 0.00001% of players?
---
This is CCP we are talking about here, they probably would. 
---
&gt;Shit takes time mate.
---
yes, the 6 balance changes that have taken place over the last 2 years
---
But people die if they are killed :(
---
Isn't it possible ratters swapped to running Trig sites to account for the drop?
---
Crack Legion
---
But I died 
---
Fc was tho 
---
I don‚Äôt remember if I was in command comms for this
---
Why did it take 15 minutes to change a diaper 
---
each day from 11.00 to 11.15.
---
Well it depends how long your night is, maybe I exaggerated a bit. Lets say 2 nights. Still the profit in empty sansha space is huge.
---
The price of minerals has dropped significanty, the volume of mined ore is probalby the same or even higher.
---
BL is a content driven alliance. They want to be on the front lines of the developing battlefield which is obvious to anyone watching legacy v frt. 
---
There was already one in Dec and the next one should hit tomorrow
---
Brack Region
---
Carefully planned staged fight, freemasons chemtrails and all organised using coded messages hidden in fortune cookies... Some pilots are just bad or panic for too long, nearly killed a sabre in a velator yesterday that way.. Guessing he de-agressed hoping to reach the gate 
---
There were also plenty of Goons working for CZ besides HVAC. 
---
And what make stealth bombers bombs deal damage to them to? So a bomb can take oit a whole asteroid? A bit stronk then wouldnt it be?.
---
I can see a way this is fair to both sides. 
---
I'm a bit ashamed to admit it, but one of my favorite breakfast sandwiches comes from a petrol station. The biscuit it's on is amazing. I am probably infested with a colony of worms by now, but I don't care. It's really tasty.
---
Okay sweetie. If you aren't tapi line member 9592 you must move at downtime, once per day, and never use your super.
---
Thank you for your wisdom.
---
As for why jfs die, that's easy. People are bad at this game. And that's okay. I'm not judging you. 
---
Hi bud! Is it still in m-o?
---
LMFAO you moving or using the super? Make up your mind? If you‚Äôre using then either you have people or going solo. Solo gg, if your moving then obviously you have a desto. You use when you get to your desto. Why do you have to be so retarded? What‚Äôs with you people these days? 
---
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
---
You have our dicks in hand. Our cynos are ready.
---
&gt;  you can be lucky, but not constantly.
---
I think I covered that. I clear as much as a single carrier in average per hour. Last week I had one system drop 650M in a few sigs in 30 minutes. Granted, I had to get the drops to market and I have an advantage being in Sansha space with IAP drops.
---
Not everyone in these sites is ratting in a super. I imaging few of them get perfect ticks every hour, either. 
---
I'm not saying they don't need to be adjusted but I would most definitely like to see how anomalies compare to other sources of isk. before breaking out the torches and pitchforks. 
---
If you are talking about a Myrm, I'll fit one together when I get home. If I figure something decent out I'll post it :) 
---
So you can only use a super in a blob, only move it in a blob (or stay up until 3am)
---
Any words of wisdom you've missed? I'm enjoying learning from you
---
Dont think so. Biggestr problem with making trig sites your main income is the volatility. Unless we get the Trig Dread soon the prices can just go down. Ratting on the other hand is stable income. 
---
Not exactly what you are asking for, but you could use Corp bulletins and mailing lists to get more fit space.
---
Yup! You fitted out the Procurer for me too. I've been crushing high sec with. Literally could AFK with my drones in the bays and live against the high sec pirates.
---
This is entirely correct. 
---
What is there for small gangs to shoot now? 
---
Everyone docks up, or drops caps on you.
---
At least when exhumers where popular there was something you could hold to force a fight. Or when VNIs where not the goto. No one saves VNIs and they are worth jack shit. Its super fun killing an afk dude.
---
Even a large gang has trouble killing rorquals, have you ever shot one? They can save all their drones, go invulnerable for 7.5 minutes and tank 11k sustained with 0 capacitor (and literally hundreds of cap boosters in cargo), or 50k+ if you don't have a couple bhaalgorns on grid (bhaalgorns eat shit to haw dreads/titans/carriers). When everyone is in rorquals, and only gangs of 100+ bombers have a good chance to kill them you probably know something is wrong. Also why should an industrial ship tank more than most FAX? like wtf?
---
&gt; Just accept that a well-fitted/flown Rorqual under the protection of a fast-forming defense-fleet is no valid target for a small gang. 
---
When the response is the rorq slapping its invuln and lighting its cyno for a dozen fax and supers, its not valid content for big gangs either. 
---
/rant
---
Well if that's the case, sounds like a viable counter fleet to me. You have any fit for the scorps btw, might need that fit at some point.
---
Source?
---
Rather than providing fits for everything, teach people how to fit a ship
---
There are occasions where this is the case. You are never the same person afterwards though.
---
Alpha scanning skills are ok. I did a lot of exploration as Omega without improving the scanning skills above Alpha level. They were always good enough for me and I had more urgent things to skill than a bit faster exploration.
---
The true disadvantage for Alphas is they can't cloak. But if you join Brave, Horde or Test, that's not an issue - you can explore in home space and there's no need to cloak.
---
A Gila on the other hand is difficult... Technically you can skill it as an Alpha, but it's a long training, and the 5M "free" SPs are probably exhausted before you can fly it very well.
---
Ccp are moving away from the isk from thin air model, pushing people into abyssal deadspace were its loot based, expect more abyssal sites soon. Not sure what loot they will add to them though? Abyssal loot market gonna crash hard soon. 
---
The same source as your stupid idea. 
---
Your ass. 
---
By the way, Havens already have dread spawns that will kill VNI in 2 shots. 
---
Wow
---
Moving from isk from thin air to loot based is a good thing for the economy.
---
Delve has almost caught up with amar in trade value 
---
Wow since when did i say blob? Putting words in my mouth. Why dont you go travel fit your super thru gal mil space. 
---
If it was a gas station you would already be dead 
---
so do we. we werent there to defend a pos. we were there just to kill you but you chickened out. don't be surprised at the tactic goons use at home being used by us and get butthurt about it.
---
To him? Who knows, might just be a fetish. But it'd make it easier to get to empirespace. Maybe get some more traffic through the region?
---
idk. Stain's pretty much garbage anyway.
---
Use fleet up 
---
He realised CSM is controlled by botting-lobby. 
---
Hypocrisy?! In EVE? I guess there really is a first time for everything
---
Also sorry, if you‚Äôd meant to ask which skills will be available to you, please expand the table within the below:
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Clone_states#Alpha_skill_set
---
Put them on your Corp forum/wiki and members can copy/paste the ones they need to pyfa and/or the game.
---
The simplist thing would have been to not add dda's in the first place... but that genie is out of the bottle.
---
Armour rokhs? What?
---
&gt; available to play right now?
---
Has it been released or is it still in alpha? It's been in alpha for years. It seems to plan on remaining in alpha. To me, that's not a game "available to play".
---
The setup reminds me of a really long term pump and dump. When the hype runs out, Chris will have been paid many millions in salary but the company itself will be broke and file bankruptcy. The funny thing is it might even be legal in the sense the company may actually be broke even though the founder struck income gold.
---
In-game "work" is already meaningless.   I can work fewer hours outside of game and sell plex with the money I earn.  Why would I want to earn it in-game?  What a waste of leisure time!  Acquisition of resources to strengthen your alliance is a different matter of course, like PI supply, mineral supply, fuel supply, etc.  Ratting for isk though... not so much (I sometimes do it for a little liquid, otherwise it drives me nuts).
---
I legit think this is dumb. Who really cares about notes enough to clutter channels even more?
---
You got the wrong narrative here kiddo. 
---
Today it‚Äôs 0RIGN joins an alliance to run VNI bots and since FRT is Chinese they are the only one doing it in all of Eve. It does sound a little bit racist in my opinion but you don‚Äôt fight r/eve.

Branch sure mines and rats alot per number of players there. 
---
Very few seriously rich people keep most of their money in liquid, especially if they're about to go inactive - they buy things like keepstar bpos to afk copy, or AT ships, or just gigantic stacks of plex. So this is probably (hopefully!) a ban-driven number. 
---
'travel fit' is the optimal small scale pvp nyx fit you dingus, any tank beyond 2m ehp does nothing for you
---
Awesome :D
---
(Please do a Wyvern. Please. I will pay you)

Have you considered that you're just fucking shit at eve?

How can I tell which level I and level II combat sites will allow my Strategic Cruiser in without having to fly to the acceleration gate? Sometimes I can get in, sometimes I can't. This is very annoying. On one hand, you skill up for a better ship and you get locked out of shit you want to do. On the other hand, it'll still let you in some gates and not others... quite frustrating. 
---
What conversation are you apart of? Obviously you‚Äôre in your own world as this entire debate been about travel fit. Now here you go talking about how 2mil ehp does nothing for you. My super unfitted with nothing on it has more eho than 2mil. You‚Äôre such a noob. STFU
---
Actually, I kinda did it in school now, oh well :)

yeah, nothing wrong with that.

Why

Such an easy fix too, ban caps from anoms unless they cyno in, and add capital anoms

u guys are toast

sure he will awox u guys with legecy toons

What would EVE Dubai be called: Burj al New Eden!
---
/never been there, not likely to go there, never even heard there was one of our number signing in from UAE.
---
Just curious, have you ever flown a super without support before? If you're hard tackled you're dead.
---
We aren't going to be using it I don't think (apart from moons + locust), so no effect on Delve ratters.  
---
Haha Yellow Legion. \[WEEB\]
---
You're overdosing on sarcasm, mate. Nobody was suggesting this was impossible.
---
In development the question is rarely "can it be done", but rather: "how much time/effort/resources is the thing worth expending".
---
To achieve the OPs suggestion you'd have to make not insignificant changes to at least two core systems (inventory and market), which would no doubt include database changes that would both cost more in terms of storage space and performance. - All for a feature that is purely cosmetic with a very limited (if any) practical purpose. 
---
Does that sound like a wise way to spend resources?
---
Dude it's not a f2p game, that would be hot garbage. Eve is a subscription game with an extended free trial. Try to understand that. This whole thread is stupid and you should feel stupid.
---
Does Frat even have a english speaking base ? Or do I have to be a forign investor money launderer to join ? They do seem like a solid alliance with good pvp content.
---
Just not a negative one lol
---
Nope, if you know the account name, and the email for hat account, and you know how to use telnet to spoof an email. You could in theory permanently delete anyone‚Äôs account. :)
---
My experience of Sansha (IAP drops) is that you're not pulling that every day.  Not in the slightest.  So averaging it out it's far lower than that, unless you're constantly doing circuits of the region and grabbing every relic that spawns, which seems unlikely as you've got to sleep and there are others doing the same.
---
Who mined that spod piece?
---
Could you add % resists too the battleships?
---
PK?
---
people do play this game 'singleplayer' 
---
but personally, i think you only get the true enjoyment of eve when you are up for joining a group.
---
for instance, in my group. we have parents and the like, they cant be around all the time, and come and go non stop. but the time they get is with friends, and rich with good convosation and some fun. learning this game is made easier by 'friends' or meeting randoms.
---
why does joining a corp tye you to it? join, join in the fun they can offer, leave whenever you want. move on, go alone, join the streamer NPSI fleets?
---
NPSI fleets are litrally anyone at at skillpoint level can join in, they tell you what ship to bring, and where to go. usually cheap.
---
there are mining groups in hisec to join which can be pretty relaxed. and an ok place to start up. and get some money before moving out to lowsec/nullsec
---
my point is, CREATE YOUR OWN LEGACY!
---
List of nullsec alliances without botting corporations:
---
I always use insta at jita 4-4, can use it with -5 pilot in BS, never had a problem. It works perfectly fine.
---
No only that! Its effect has to be calculated as an AOE set of information that the servers must calculate, interpret and apply to each individual person so it really puts the pace back into a reasonable time interval playstyle!
---
Every system has 6-8 Supers + a Marshy, so those of us doing our duty not min-maxing all PvE content up the wazoo like desperados (I don't mine in Rorqs, I don't rat in my super) are getting fucked harder.  The umbrella rarely drops for subs unless they're bait.
---
So overall PvE is closed-off for me right now, except the occassional incursion, the odd Hub and a bit of PI.
---
Corp bulletins, mailing list, fits in channel motd. Lots of ways to solve your problem
---
This is worse.
---
Where is Tri narrative they don't blob?
---
In those days everyone had a High Sec Level 4 mission running alt, before CCP nerfed High Sec mission income.
---
im not going to try and understand your feels or such, but might i suggest, go and buy at1 destroyer or t1 cruiser (something cheap in terms of your money in game right now)
---
go and fly to lowsec. and sit somewhere, just sit there, let some random kill you. do this 3 times, 4? and maybe youll get used to being like, mehwhatever ive seen my shields and armour go down. whatever, and then, when you go back to hisec, you might just be a little more calm, and SHOULD someone attack you (i doubt it) youve been there before, you get it, next ship. 
---
You can look at the zkill to answer that question but generally yes, they have an international base. FRT is definitely not 100% Chinese as for some reason everyone thinks.
---
While I agree to some extent with most of your post, ratting actually /does/ contribute to the economy... IF you salvage the wrecks, melt it down and/or use the mods to build/fit ships.
---
Also, I actually love ratting in slightly less popular anomalies such as the Hidden Rally Points at zero warp in... managing drones, targets, range etc... I imagine I am not the only one.
---
This is an absolutely horrid idea to remove auto-aggress and the amount of screeching it would generate could force the community to implode into a fiery death spiral.
---
You forget drone aggro is EXTREMELY useful in pvp, especially when you get ECM‚Äôd. Yes, your ship is jammed, but I‚Äôm willing to bet in the age of spaceships those drones have enough AI power to recognize a threat.
---
As well as your posting.
---
Fuck I‚Äôm upvoting a globby post.
---
Gating them alone would make Smartbombs without input broadcasting, and supers impractical. 
---
So marshy is running a dual Xeon? 
---
Never met another myself... might just be me alone in the desert!
---
tats pretty normal. everyone gets nervous, 'am i doing it right' 'i dont want to fuck up' 'i dont want to make a fool of myself'
---
like, EVERYONE gets like that ESPECIALLY in the first year of eve. or first 6months of actually joining fleets.
---
me? i get more nervous fighting NPC's in this game. if idie to some nerd in a fight, i mean, whatever, thats the game. as long as your in a certified fit by some leet pro duder xD. its waaay worse dying to rats or NPC's than a player.
---
You rarely catch anyone paying attention anyway. 
---
Oh yea I too wonder of the terrible consequences that might occur if one accepts Eve EULA
---
u wot m8
---
&gt; that every day. Not in the slightest. So averaging it out it's far lower than that, unless you're constantly doing circuits of the region and grabbing every relic that spawns, which seems unlikely as you've got to sleep and there are others doing the same.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Besides the value of IAP is demand driven isn't it. They're valuable because they're required to build things that there's a strong demand for.
---
I have pretty close to perfect scanning and hacking/arch skills, so doing a site doesn't take me more than a few minutes. It's a rare day I don't average 200M an hour, and I grab many of the data (incl covert) sites, too. I do tend to explore when eve is at the lower end of active users and my best hour straddles downtime, where you can get two for one spawn specials.
---
We're getting off topic, though. My personal isk generation compares well to havens. I'd like to see how all of the faucets compare to each other before going after ratters (less the botters, they should all DIAF).
---

Worse or better makes no odds.
---
It's the only reason afk ratting is a thing.
---
If drones didn't do everything for me, go couldn't go afk.
---
If you say "200m an hour", you need to also say for how many hours straight.  And if you say more than 3 my next question is which bot are you using.
---
Don't use the R word around here, partner. Folks got bad experiences. 
---
Or people are bored and busy taking a shit in the north, or playing other games.
---
Do you ever wonder how your simple sentence half-assed comments do look like to other people? I doubt it, because if you did, you would see the apparent irony of your comment. 
---
You know, if you want to be edgy, it helps to be at least moderately intelligent. :*
---
It‚Äôs because eve is free to play, they don‚Äôt want subscribers anymore 
---
200 IQ move by elo really.
---
Korea is getting localization, meaning a huge influx of players are soon to be in-bound which will be coupled with their advertisement campaigns at Internet Cafes and Food Courts. Fraternity in the third quarter are going to explode in numbers. This will allow them told hold Elo Knight as their CSM rep, which will in turn generate a large influx of votes.
---
After he secures the CSM, he can turn on the Botters in Frat and hunt them down.
---
Elo, god bless fam
---
Ha!  I‚Äôll see what I can do, I just moved to Roseville... Yesterday. 
---
Can someone explain this bullshit
---
Apex legends. 
---
You know that the k adds nothing but price if you don't overclock right?
---
nice flair, lmao
---
I don't believe that information is available via ESI, so you'd need to scout the systems yourself or get some kinda organized group to do it.   
---
Keep in mind, Cynojam status wasn't visible on the UI until recently, you had to actually attempt to light a cyno. 
---
Did he get it?
---
I approve.
---
I had no idea you had it in you.
---
PvP's purpose is to release pods for consumption.
---
The answer my friend is blowing in the space wind.
---
The K variants usually also dont have the integrated graphics, which in my limited experience only causes issues when you also have a proper gpu. Most bioses also have an auto-oc feature for the K variants
---
Ishtars with Sentries

HML Cerbs

Maelstroms (lmao cheaper and just as effective)
---
If you are looking at winning and isk war, and not to delete every single mach on field, there are attrition doctrines;
---
Ferox's (50 ferox vs 50 Machs, ferox will win the isk war)
---
Hurricanes
---
If you want to be an asshole;
---
Any Booshing fleet with high DPS dessies/cruisers to swoop after a boosh. Really good if the mouth breathers are using FAX
---
Oh, of course it is a horrid idea Bill, but no more horrid than what the OP is trying to do.
---
Still, that's one more obstacle reducing the risk.
---
This sounds like a case for Texas Law
---
&gt; And if you say more than 3 my next question is which bot are you using and how many ships do you have out.
---
So everyone who does better than your experience must be a bot? Man, you can fuck yourself sideways with that insinuation. I've done explo for years as my primary isk making gig. 
---
They have quite a few english entities in frat. Btw bcrow is recruiting üòä
---
lol if u think TEST are blue with us you're way outa touch, why do you think INIT left Delve proper? why do you think SV and GSF are having so many arguments and not to mention the power struggles in the last 7 months. 
---
tldr the Goon truce with GOTG started a major rift within us goons, hence why INIT rage dropped internal channels and ties temporarily, even having a meeting to leave altogether.... The HK eviction was my favorite, I cant wait  for those logs to be leaked 
---
Then there's the move to fountain for BASTN, Kendar and Carneros hate each other there's some juicy drama going on there, another highlight to come. 
---
We've been bleeding alliances since the casino war. Lets count them: FCON, CO2, +Snuff, on the fence we have Init, -Snuff left ( just here for supers btw), BASTN and INIT leaving and then  GSF proper on suicide watch.  The only loyal alliance we have left is KF which is a newbro fleet drinking the koolaid still, and most of them are afk rorqing losing Excavators in Delve... Oh wait, we have AMOK sry (lol)
---
Test/SkillU is the place to be in 2019 (or Panfam/Frat et al). I'm afraid us Goons are a hollow coalition and the next war will probably finish us off sadly. 
---
Change my view :)
---
0-1
---
1 and more and it is certainly bot..... or a fucking idiot
---
idk which is worse :D

this is a way better markov generator than dinobrain was.

these threads are full of max pepega responses 
---
over the years youve been going back and deleting accounts? bro, this makes no sense to me in relation to everything else your saying.
---
so youve already accepted the EULA, and deleted accounts in the past. so why the change of heart?
---
why  not just add the eve newsletter into your spam list? or block list?
---
why not simply change your password to somthing not the same as anything else you use and then forget about the account completely
---
The issue with running abyssal space site is that value goes down pretty fast with the amount of people running. I could see prices going down the more and more I ran them.

How much rocks could rorq botter bot if rorq botter could bot rocks

...And another month when Sink/Faucet charts are still screwed:

[https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/CHchCuYD4913zYMd60p0i/afd20d7af38cad76abfac5b7b87aecde/9a\_sinksfaucets.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/CHchCuYD4913zYMd60p0i/afd20d7af38cad76abfac5b7b87aecde/9a_sinksfaucets.png) \--&gt; This chart shows all sinks/faucets with the top 4 faucets being Bounties, Commodity, Incursions and Insurance (this last one should probably be netted) and 'top' 4 sinks being Skills, Transaction taxes, Broker Fees and BPOs.
---
And yet, this chart --&gt; [https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/73TRlye8nvxcDnv13mWSEd/848ce745d19bf0dc3b8ecfd2f1e6a355/9aaa\_top.sinks.faucets.over.time.png](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/73TRlye8nvxcDnv13mWSEd/848ce745d19bf0dc3b8ecfd2f1e6a355/9aaa_top.sinks.faucets.over.time.png) \--- has all of the NPC Markets excluded (without any note) which makes Top 1 faucet and 2 Sinks not show up in this chart.  
---
WTF CCP? 
---
Yes, lets add as much useless data and slow down the game any way we can... 
---
&gt; Has it been released or is it still in alpha? It's been in alpha for years. It seems to plan on remaining in alpha. To me, that's not a game "available to play". 
---
It's an Open-Alpha meaning every backer can play it. Why are you not able to comprehend this?
---
&gt; The setup reminds me of a really long term pump and dump. When the hype runs out, Chris will have been paid many millions in salary but the company itself will be broke and file bankruptcy. The funny thing is it might even be legal in the sense the company may actually be broke even though the founder struck income gold. 
---
 Yup its a con Chris is doing it purely to get rich (not that he wasn't beforehand) and he is paying 500+ people a wage to just sit around on their bums and do nothing. Oh yes, and while we're at it, let's not forget to say the earth is flat :D
---
A nyx

Frat has a decent sized English-speaking population. We are recruiting a lot of new members as well with the likelihood of a war with TEST soon.

Probably a rattlesnake

You got 9 whole days to put you life together then, how much time could you possibly need? :P

That was neither edgy nor half assed, it was a perfectly timed meme which delivered more than the expected response.

True.
---
Marshy and Olmeca are being relevant...ü§£
---
check the uni wiki site in the combat anomalies section. 
---
Or just google the name of whatever you scanned down (like everything else in eve online and you might found the information you need )

Dude you are so smart because FRT is definitely a Korean alliance and all Asians play together
---
/r/ConcernTrolling
---
way to go! Excellent job
---
I would be surprised if it wasn't ban-related. It's still a MASSIVE amount coming out of the economy, totaling 68.32T ISK in 'disappearance', which is effectively 63.7% of the total ISK faucets. Now I assume that the banwaves don't happen monthly (for some reason I think it's quarterly?), which still puts over 20% of all ISK generated as bot activity.
---
Realistically it would be somewhere between 30% and 60% of all faucets being generated by bots, because we've been seeing a negative ISK delta for multiple MERs now. This is really telling about game health at the moment. I'd assume the ban waves include ratting bots, courier mission bots, and hopefully market bots too. Hard to tell where on that list most of the banned ISK lands though, as there were an outrageous amount of courier bots banned, yet a single good market bot could be rolling billions in profit every day.
---
Tether range is huge, look at the ring if lights around the structure and add about 10km.
---
I would imagine having Amarr as the only playable race, biomassing atheists, and keeping spaceship command skills locked for female players makes for quite unique EVE experience?
---
This is a perfect example of why you make a bookmark on the structure and not just warping to 0.
---
Can someone ELI5 me what they do with this delve money? Like, if risk aversion is a thing and ships no pew pew then what are all these rorq miners and anom ratters doing? Watching wallet tick and getting into a titan then sitting around doing nothing to maybe drop in standing fleet? I legitimately have no idea what people do with that level of money, I‚Äôve existed on like 2-5 bill at any time just plexing myself into frigates.
---
Bot spotted
---
You have the sound turned on 4 clients at once? Hell, I don‚Äôt have it turned on at all. 
---
 I‚Äôm assuming you have a onboard sound chip which should be doing the heavy work of producing sound, don‚Äôt think adding a pci-e sound card would really make much of a difference since it‚Äôs not the cpu producing the sound. 
---
Fraternity is trying to diversify so they have a fighting force in USTZ and EUTZ in addition to the Chinese timezone.

Cause you gotta have players to have bots

Exactly what I was going to comment.

Sure, keep deluding yourself even more. :) 
---
Reality sends its regards. She says it's been long time no seeing you around.
---
Awesome work!
---
&gt; between 30% and 60% of all faucets being lost to bans
---
that really is a pretty massive amount of total wealth generation, although isk faucets are the most bottable (compared to mining, incursions, etc). 
---
I'd be interested in seeing how much of the **sp market** is being lost to bans, though - if botters keep buying loads of injectors and then getting re-banned, it's probably part of why injectors are at 900m/ea right now. :(
---
If it's any encouragement, good market bots still ain't shit compared to real traders. 
---
Oh yeah, Father Finkelstein can relate. :D
---
I'm thinking I should make the pilgrimage to Olmeca and enter the &gt;!Com!&lt;Promised Land...
---
Whilst I enjoy the creativity, this isn't Saudi :) \*sips beer and returns to bacon sandwich\*
---
Sweet. Frat getting ready to cut teeth.
---
7, after that clearly bot
---
I don‚Äôt know why my post triggered you so hard, it wasn‚Äôt really that much of a zinger nor meant to be super duper spicey zinger. It‚Äôs quite hilarious how angry you getting are about it.
---
Is it the same as in any other game? If you got all the best gear in WoW for paying cash for it does it mean you will automatically win? No you could suck at PVP and lose, however it is most certainly an edge to have better mods, ships, and skills then everyone else. P2Win has never been an instant win button in any game, just that you have an advantage over someone who doesn't pay or put in A LOT of time.
---
The only difference with EvE is when it comes to ships and mods you can lose them, though not entirely unheard of as some p2win items have specific number of uses especially in mobile games. Skills of course are permanent. 
---
That Abbadon Amarr superweapon (remember storylines?).
---
Serious answer: No direct counter (as in number for number). Your best bet would be a war of attrition (yay ferox fleet). If you insist on fighting it out, maybe Foxcats/Rokh's (i wanna see a foxcat fleet again!).
---
Racism in EVE, what are you, fucking Russian?
---
&gt; It‚Äôs quite hilarious how angry you getting are about it.
---
Wishful thinking, or projecting, my dear friend. I am just procrastinating at work you know? Conversations with reddit stupid wannabe edgelords is still better than boredom. :*
---
Supers aren't deployed
---
It's as much of a case of Amarr's significant decline as a trade hub as Jita becomes more and more centralized
---
They log in their Gila bots, Gila bots find proper combats sites, Gila bots run em. Has really gotten ridiculous during the last year or so. I used to jump to HS from time to time to goof of and curse the loot fairy while I roleplay a HS carebear. Nowadays its almost useless because every site worthwile will be farmed not only by the HS stockholm syndrome people but by countless bots going in a circle full day.
---
Ya, the south Koreans are best buddies with China. everyone knows that. 
---
now declare war on them
---
&gt; So everyone who does better than your experience must be a bot?
---
Yes.
---
In addition, does anyone use a Prorator for tackle/covert cyno? I mean, who fucking expects a Transport ship to drop a Blops?
---
I'd buy that.
---
Which is why I find null people complaining about Incursions even more strange now - not only do they account for only 6% of all faucets (compared to the 65% of bounties in null), they aren't bottable, require higher investment to do (some 'elite' groups request battleships that cost more than carriers), and are arguably just as dangerous due to ganks.
---
I'd speculate that the loss of injectors doesn't drive the cost of them up that much. It's a combination of too many bots and other easy income sources that let people afford it. A new bot will pay a single injector off in roughly 30 hours assuming 30M/h income. There's no way a bot will be banned in two days, unless it is something extremely egregious. After that it's pure profit, so of course they will be willing to pay that much.
---
Similarly active players can multibox Rorqs for massive profit after selling the materials off, so they could probably earn enough for an injector while watching Netflix. Super ratting is a bit more iffy, but people who do it claim 200-300M/h figures, so that's not a long time to grind for alts either.
---
Couple this oversupply of ISK with the demand to inject more supers / rorqs / alts / bots, and you have a problem. Same thing with PLEX and Multi-char training certificates.
---
What is a 1060TI?

Very nice work ! I prefer your drawings but this paint is awesome !

Please, if you will, do a SOE ship :))
---
Every player has own ways of finding fun things to do in New Eden, either just sitting on a titan and wait for a ping or doing ratting with that or just trading on a station. There are countless ways and you will find out if you try new things
---
Edit: Also we do ded rated sites for rare drops

Thanks /u/avree ... if you only knew.

It‚Äôs mind boggling you think I‚Äôm attempting to be edgy with a ‚Äú*lol u bad posted*‚Äù comment...

If you know of any bots in Test, let me know.
---
I only thought about if I could meme, not if I should.  I realize now the answer to both is yes.
---
Well, you shouldn't be you know
---
People think that because they were 100% Chinese for a good long while. You literally couldn‚Äôt use their services without being in/from China initially since they used one of the Chinese chat programs. Then they switched to Discord and started accepting non-Chinese corps.
---
Eve has sound?
---
Try turning it off and see how it performs
---
about time someone recognizes how smart i am. Thank you.
---
go forward into the light
---
It is mind boggling to imagine that you think at all.
---
All sounds good until Elo realizes that he's unable to communate with 95% of the alliance and FC's orders get lost in translation. 
---
You have been officiailly censored, I will not officially stand for this.
---
I wasn't aware fraternity went to Thera
---
What a thannie
---
&gt; Can someone ELI5 me what they do with this delve money? 
---
Whatever we feel like. 
---
Investing, just watching them sit there and see the wallet balance rising, supporting our corps and alliances, just flying around with unimaginably expensive ships, making 10 new Rorq alts plexing them all and skilling them accordingly... Buying hundreds of semi-cheap ship fits and handing them as FC to anyone willing to go and lose them in a fight. Or just buying a ton of titans to look at them docked in Keepstar and occasionally drop them... 
---
Make fittings chat channel. Link the fittings channel(s) in your corp motd.
---
Lol good one
---
Yeah, but 1,5B Rattlesnake is enough for those, no need to bring titans :)
---
There are still sound cards being made for non music nerds in 2019?
---
You mean the "Yellow Legion" "Brack Region" posts are racist? Clearly you just don't get the jokes or are some kinda snowflake /s
---
I buy my ISK with RL money.  I can afford to.
---
After looking it over looks like people caught on so the scalpers are hitting the non k i5 pretty hard so the k version is cheaper when normally its the other way around.
---
im sorry for awoxing you yesterday joebane, i guess our standings changed like 20min or something before our fight xD
---
We use chat channels with fits in the MOTD.

Way overpowered and one of those GPUs doesn't even exist.

Is storage that expensive? I feel like this mattered 15 years ago, now not so much.

Could always join origin for the duration of the campaign ,üòÅ
---
 I think they also have some groups that speak English. Most people seem to be able to use English to some extent
---
Try 60++
---
Yeah, corp and personal could use a bit of an expansion imho.  I am constantly having to delete fits to add more.  I do not want to save them in a note, optimally i'd like to use the existing in game fit management utility without it's arbitrary limit.
---
try goku bombers, or bombers in general. you don't have to use battleships against battleships. you should be able to sig tank their fleet. unless i am wrong
---
Eh, only about a 10% reduction. January (which has 31 days) was 2.7 tril/day in bounties; February (at 28 days) was at 2.5 tril/day. Noticeable, sure, but not *significant* IMO. Plus there's other factors like for example Querious (where Init has lots of ratters) saw a 20% reduction, which would align with their deployment.

i wish non consensual pvp wasn't relegated to retards or totally afk people

This is why I feel bad.

Glad I dont have the threat of experiencing it on a daily basis any longer.
---
Time heals, but the memories... *they're with you forever*
---
haha, this was my first thought too xD
---
Do we need a fix for AFK VNI ratting? 
---
This game has a fuck ton of grind already, I'm fine with there being a few ways to make AFK money. Live people spinning around havens while pvping on an alt are all fine by me, it doesn't make that much money. It's the bots that need a fix. 
---
That's a big step up from my Tandy 3000

I think he's parodying all the posts by the "I'm a developer, and this would be easy for ccp to implement" crowd that have obviously never done professional game development before.  At least I hope he is.

I have a ryzen 7 1700, GTX 1080, 32gb ram and can run 5 4k clients just fine.

Why'd you leave a semi legitimate corp to join the Belle Delphine fan club? 
---
Are we supposed to be guessing what your issue might be since you didn't tell us what the problem was? 
---
I like mysteries so I'll start! Your fingers are too fat and every time you press a number, you'll press five other characters at the same time and CCP doesn't accept this garbled credit card number. Use chopsticks to fix this issue.
---
people joke, but turning off audio improves the games performance a bunch
---
Well back then anoms weren't really a thing either so warping belt to belt was rather daft
---
True. We need a black skin for the kimamora so it matches the in game pic. Rather have resources go there instead.

I get that I guess, I‚Äôve been around since 2009, mostly solo in black rise though I‚Äôve been in almost every major power bloc at some point. I‚Äôm trying wormholes for the first time and it‚Äôs been interesting so I see new things as fun, just seems the average line member would get that titan, do nothing with it then win eve, I‚Äôm curious what member retention is when you effectively have unlimited money during peace time

Millions of ore can be mined in a day by 5 covetors, the nerf wouldnt stop that

Just learn to say ‚Äúmuninns, anchor up, prop mod on, push F1‚Äù in whatever Chinese dialect they use. Done.
---
In all seriousness, like most multicultural groups there are translators, and broadcasts, visual cues, and just repetition solve most of these problems.
---
I‚Äôm now pretty nostalgic about joining a couple fleets with my friends in the Unthinkables, and Mogila (Russian FC from VIT.C) took over. Listening to him rapidly switch commands between English to Russian was an incredible experience (not to mention his incredible passion for the game). Guess I‚Äôm going off topic a bit.
---
Black Legion probably didn't, not really any space to krab unless you can set bots up for burner missions? Sounds like an easy way to lose faction frigs though :&lt;

Sorry that I was not more specific. If I select an omega subscription I can enter my address and hit next, then there is no area to enter payment details. It‚Äôs blank.

I get the economic part, I don‚Äôt see every line member In delve as an economist though. I don‚Äôt see unimaginable kill mails, I‚Äôd assume those pop up on reddit but current eve only really has at ships as a god tier kill mail these days with all the supers. Clearly the numbers show delve provides a certain level of interesting to a high number of people. Once I give up on my wormhole maybe I‚Äôll head out that way. I just hate super huge fleets, I know small gang mostly almost a meme now, maybe someday I‚Äôll FC small groups out of delve to harass something 30 jumps away.

I played with a free trial a couple of years ago, loved the game but didn't have a great PC and couldn't justify the subscription.

The game has been in the back of my mind recently and I wanna give it another shot. I see it's being advertised as f2p, but I plan to buy a sub if I enjoy the game.

This killmail doesnt deserve a post. There are atleast 2 guys on every big fleet in such fits. 99% of the time they are new poor bros. Dedicated and keen on doing their part guys which deserve respect not mockery.
---
We had a bot in delve that killed any ship with a cyno up that was near them.

Which just meant we could test a bunch of suspicious alts and then kill/kick them if they did it.

Uh, here's my upvote, now get out of here

Exactly this. Alpha accounts can't _train_ over 5mil (so your character will not be able to gain new SP unless via injection). But any skills already trained stay known. 
---
Omega-locked skills like PI stuff or Triglavian ships etc. will be 'hibernated' and not count (but will reactivate if you upgrade to Omega again). Any other skills you have will continue to count, whether that amounts to 1mil, 5mil, or the full 10mil SP.

came here to comment this

Basicly, try out new things, don't burn yourself out, do the things you enjoy! This game as a lot of depth to it, so don't get scared by it :)
---
F2P is great approach to the game, and if you know what you are doing you can make a good living out of it.  While you can't fly most ships (this sounds like a really bad thing, but it isn't so much as training into the ships you can't fly without a subscription take long to get into anyway), the core gameplay elements are defenitly enjoyable.

I flew with a few small gang alliances back in 2012/2013. Pwn-o-graphy and Happy cartel out of Stain and if I remember correctly they were mostly Hungarian and maybe Belgian. Some of the best black ops fleets i've been apart of. They would always have someone translating in english. But then again they were small gang groups in NPC space. Something tells me a 10k player  sov alliance in mostly chinese would be  a bit different 
---
Wasnt Valkorsia a shitposting bot?
---
I have been contemplating a 2700X or a 2920WX or something for my setup of 6 to 8 clients.

3600X, 3700X and 3850X looks like they might be real beasts for gaming with that core count + threads and frequency .

If there is a slight chance you might win strategically (not just a few fights) this will be a war with Imperium and Legacy.

i ask me about the fit/implants on the stiletto. I know most frameworks prefer ewar over dps ships and also sometimes ignore people further then n km away, so getting the bomber out of danger all the time should be kinda easy. But i'm not sure if a standard stiletto outruns thanny fighters from a bot mh.
---
why not go for a dual epyc while you are at it?
---
yeah my reason for moving anyways I'm fed up with well the speed of Ryzen being locked to Ram speed. Granted it easy to do just annoying to re-tweak if it ever resets itself and then all the testing.
---
Also because i now have a 2080ti and might be able to get more out of it with the 3000 series chips.
---
Max clients i run are 4. 
---
The only problem really is games they are still reliant on single cores your better of going for a higher clock speed CPU. (Looking at you Tarkov)

mega lol. i'm fluent in both english and russian. and many frat members do understand english. at least 50%

&gt;I don't believe so. All SC systems will be in one level . They just expand the playable area as needed. SC uses a technology called "Object Container Streaming" to handle this.
---
Nah, you won't be able to fly from one system to another in normal space. Each system is a separate map, just like pretty much every other space game.

You can use the 'Structure Browser' in-game (you can find it in the Neocom menu). Player-owned stations that have reprocessing will also have ore-compression.    
---
Hopefully your corp has a station with compression, that .5 system should have decent ores (for Hi-sec at least.)

This could be taken as a positive, instead of assuming drug reference.  I like it.

I agree with multiple comments below. Forums/Third party service or using a set of in game chat channels. A channel to link all fitting channels and each fitting channel with your list of fits for a specific activity is how we have it set up.

In addition to the other replies, I'd say you should probably tighten your focus. Industry is a big subject, and you can't really do everything.

---
Kinda like kill marks
---
I see what you mean, however I still wouldn't exactly say it's a P2W system, more like a Pay to Skip. If there are exclusive gameplay items in the game that you MUST buy using cash money, that's P2W.
---
In eve, what exactly is "winning"? Maybe your 2bn garmur killed some scrub tristan, but unless you can consistently kill 2bn+ worth of ships it doesn't even pay for itself. If kb stats is winning, then flying bling with no skill just means you lose. The way I look at it, having more isk just means you have more options, like the ability to buy 5000 fitted t1 frigs so you do logistics less often. Credit card warriors are losing at eve more often than they are winning, there was a guy just straight up losing 2 paladins in Kamela in a single day... faction mods and shit.
---
I guess the difference is that each module in EVE has a market value, is it really worth risking a 1bn module for that 10% increase in &lt;insert whatever stats here&gt; when you can use a slightly worse T2 mod that cost maybe 1mil? If you credit card into bling, you're taking on such an irrational amount of risk. Which is why it's not very often that someone credit cards into pvp and still hasn't ragequitted yet.
---
Skill points tho... that's the most P2W shit in this game. 
---
It's not always better to fly bling mods and ships in eve pvp because ultimately it's a game of isk efficiency, unless your name is Jones Otsada, crazy irish bastard.
---

Solo meaning only one operator running two accounts like the post describes

wtf, i dont understand this universe

What you really said: Because solo blops isn't possible, I want to still use the word solo and make it mean something other than solo means because my vocabulary is limited. Also, because I don't like you pointing that out I will insult you.

**KNEE SLAPPING INTENSIFIES**
---
That is correct. However, claiming to be solo while  multiboxing is not solo. That's like saying "singular many" or "individual group". They are mutually exclusive. I get that you think it's semantics, it's not. It also isn't important if you don't mind being incorrect at a basic level.

CCP should probably consider adding a loyalty point system related to anoms (or ratting generally), as loyalty point shops are amazing isk sinks for mission runners--one of the biggest isk sinks in the game actually--and mitigate the facet that is mission payments and bounties. 
---
its an inconvenient truth. you live in a time where a carrier with a cloak is cheaper and significantly more effective, until the titan umbrella shows up. 
---
its a krabs game now
---
His mention of solo is in relation to himself as an individual- likely relying on his own knowledge of the space as opposed to working in a pack of hunters with an elaborate intel network. You're making an assumption that the only use of the generic word "solo" can be to describe accounts. It's a word with a definition and if you were capable of reading for context you'd understand that he isn't talking about some Eve Online exclusive definition of the word. It's pretty clear what he is talking about and it's obviously not capital S, Solo PVP. 
---
There are a lot of people that assert that multi boxing is solo play. You know, the kind that run an AF, with a cmd to boosh them out if they get in trouble and used to use links off grid. But claim it's solo and just want gud fites and 1v1. That is not solo play amigo. That was my point, perhaps approached with a hammer.
---
Yeah you can get 100k ehp and blasters. Its just so alphas can join in on vanguards.
---
There is something wrong with machine/network configuration on your side - I also open 3 clients and when I get a socket closed on one of them, others immediately follow it into the abyss...
---
It's obvious what he meant, yes. But he could have said radish or street sign or dump truck. If we are interchanging words to fit the context of what someone means. You hamster my drift?

---
some still do it. but in general its not as...ideal as it used to be.  T3C are far cheaper and more survivable.  while black ops are pricey and prone to cap drops.
---
plus...Widow got the nerf bat between the legs so hard its still screaming in pain
---
We tried this but the issue is we noticed a drop of people from in game to out of game with discord. We then tried to use fleetup and people just are not intrested in more out of game stuff. Every out of game thing we suggest is more loss of people intrrsted.
---
Lol 
---
Yeah its a good shout and we actually do this as much as we can but for a brand new player that is overkill info
---
Are you inferring Jesus imagined this? Or was the lack of a comma related to the lack of intelligence?
---
Probably 1-5% of players have built 90% of ships.
---
Don't get a job at the fair guessing weights and ages. You won't make any money mate.
---
now you care about grammar?
---
We are a brand new player friendly corp. Anything more than learning the game UI which is to them very confusing and overwhelming is a negative.
---
yes you are
---
I'd put you at around  5'10 and 275.

Which popped up on reddit, I‚Äôd also imagine it‚Äôs not the average line member but yeah

What you said: I am one of those people that runs 5 accounts and considers it honorable 1v1 and since you called me out, I am angry and will try to insult you by assuming you only run one account which makes me superior!
---
Mostly dead. The current Krab progression of VNI &gt; Carrier/Rorq &gt; Super/Rorq's leaves no real targets for a solo BLOPs unless you like dropping on 60 mill VNI's, which can be killed with a frigate if thats your thing.
---
What you said: Unngggh. Words hard. Profanity. Unngghh. 
---
You made zero dollars. That would put you at 0 and 3 for guessing so far.
---
Shortest and best rollercoaster.
---
Sad but true. Blops are in a bad place until CCP drops the price barrier by a huge amount. No reason not to use a T3C instead.
---
Also RIP Widow :-(
---
never not have a sb proteus alt at the sun :))
---
Will see.  We also knows quality of the average fight will go steeply downhill if Imperium and significant northern assets come.
---
ah, more ratters for us to kill when we are actually active!
---
lot more probable a significant Korean alliance pops up somewhere else.
---
disable all sound. It provides absolutely no value in this game.
---
:D ... that made me laugh more then it should as it is actually sad
---
Envy.
---
how will I know if one of my rorqs is getting yeeted?
---
This. Maybe subjective bias, but in the last year or so I've really started to notice Amarr becoming a bad place to acquire stuff. Periodically the market runs out of/short on basic bread-and-butter items that it never used to.
---
Fuck yeah I remember this one. Its so good, gives that special eve online vibe which you nearly cant even get from the game itself these days.
---
Hey dude I will try and answer your question best I can.
---
* Why drop blops when you can drop carriers (which are better) for cheaper?
---
* Why drop blops when you are likely to be coutner dropped by a carrier?
---
* People don't drop blops on VNIs because it isnt worth it, and the alternative is dropping on rorqs which is super dumb.
---
* People don't drop on carriers much unless they are using bombers because carriers turbo dunk blops and the widow doesn't work anymore.
---
* T3s can hunt, and kill almost better than dual boxer with a sin and a HK.
---
Ok now i'm moving onto hunting DED runners which is what people like Gulnar and Ronan used to do and me to some extent.
---
* People run DEDs in covert t3s (thanks t3 change) which makes it impossible to scan them down and they can warp just about anywhere out of their site. Bling recons such as the lachesis don't really help because a smart runner uses a scout on their gate, and/or they leave site as soon as you enter local.
---
* You need to put bubbles on the citadels to stop DED runners flying straight to the stations. The issue with this is that most systems have 5+ citadels for you to bubble unlike the 1 outpost or corp owned POS you used to have.
---
* None of the capture methods work if the target warps straight to station when you hit intel. 
---
* Not as many people run DEDs after the DED nerf, and the proliferation of carriers and rorquals. 
---
* The people who do run snakes etc for their DEDs don't often warp to safes, and/or warp straight to station, keep in mind there is now a station in just about every system for them to go to.
---
* People do DEDs in blops such as widows, dual sins and marshals. These can jump to an exit cyno as soon as you pose a threat, and get cloak bonuses which makes them extremely hard to decloak and hold without a sabre.
---
Of course there are exceptions to all of these, and people who don't fly safely and get caught anyway. There are still some people you can catch but it takes so much more time and counter droppers such as /u/fredrick_vonhole make life difficult :)
---
https://twitter.com/CCP_Falcon/status/1105135442012323845
---
Mission accomplished.
---
Botting is worse. Idiots can learn and/or be removed. Lose a carrier that many times and corp management might just give em the boot. If for no other reason than ob and because losing that many means bringing hunters back for content which is usually not the point of making income. Hunters go anywhere... but mostley where they get kills.
---
Way to hijack a thread about something worth discussing so that you can masturbate over semantics. 
---
Ok.  So far the big WTF for me was the region of Syndicate having 1.9T mined.  That is about equal to Detroid and more than any other region besides the core Imperial regions or Esoteria.
---
I asked CCP if he was a Drifter now with that cold, dark stare. http://imgur.com/gallery/JoIyWRd
---
\~5200+ bot bans this year to date -- we are ramping up our detection as promised. Bans are being issued every single day; they are not done in waves. If this changes I'll let you know.. 
---
Which system?
---
Thanks for the nightmares
---
\^\^ This here.
---
It's just much more practical atm to use a T1 fit, insured carrier.  
---
The minor downsides (cant panic MJD away, shorter jumprange - off the top of my head) are far outweighed by pros of the additional DPS, overall tank, and insurance for when you eat shit.
---
Also a little breakdown by duration... Macro use Permanent: 4950, Macro use Temporary: 35 
---
Modified Clients - 0 temporary, 500+ permanent. 
---
**and while I'm at it I need to say that if you are using AP0 we see you and you should stop right now.** 
---
My R9 380X runs 6 clients without breaking a sweat. The 1660Ti (assuming that's what you meant by 1060) is basically twice as much card as that.  So you believe the new client will be over 6 times as GPU intensive as the current one? 
---
Stay in your lane, F1 monkey!
---
Because their version of ‚ÄúSalt‚Äù is them just being too cowardly and unable to grab themselves by the balls and grab SOV.
---
Just run forsaken hubs. Similar ticks, worse escalations, no dread spawns.
---
That vintage... everything!!! (also this has been one of my favorite songs ever since)
---
Thanks for taking the time to answer.  That's what I thought.  You are absolutely correct. So what is a boy to do ?&gt; lol - game is getting boring....  Are you recruiting? 
---
Well no, not everyone in Delve is flying Moloks. On the other hand, yes. That guy *was* just a "line member". He wasn't some director or corp CEO that took all the tax money and spent it on himself.
---
damn, you stole my idea!
---
ok well get a load of this: what if we get rid of POS code and made stations destructible by making a new type of player structure?
---
Gimme them ol'time Caldari ships.
---
well it depends what your ign is :)
---
Id say give it a go, there are certainly things still to catch. Try a few different regions and see what you can get. I had a little rule I would follow, if it looks slightly suspicious, its bait. 
---
Will do, I will for sure keep trying.....  I really admire the skill it takes and refuse to join a 100 man blops

Lowering activation energy does not produce a strong reaction per say but I like the attempt.

Is it legal for a woman to pilot a spaceship in UAE or does she require a male relative to be present while she VNI rats?

What is special about SOV?
---
Get it?
---
I have a soft spot for the old graphics. The new stuff is great but it looks too... crisp and clean, almost like Mass Effect.
---
probably making a bigger impact on fountain.
---
anyways, don't forget their campaign prior to the invasion of GoTG led to a very softened and demoralized target.

If people can't be asked to use Discord or fleet-up, purge those useless meatbags.

Being able to solo blops drop is important?

Underrated idea tbh

Too rich to give a fuck, I presume.

Sure, shoot me a PM!

---
Syndicate has a notoriously large number of moons. It used to be a fairly major conflict point between Pure Blind/Fade Horde and INIT, I'd assume that's goons/INIT locusting them as they expand northwards.
---
gimme them ol'time EVE to play 
---

---
Do you know any good active groups now? 
---
You could say they‚Äôre a Tornado in a teapot. 
---
B R O...I'm like 25 and i hear you on this, I played I think all day yesterday for the first time....Bought Omega the same night and I think my girl's gonna leave me haha...worth it. Most fun I've had online gaming in years and I NEVER EVEN WENT TO LS YET
---
Can't talk about Abyssal sites, never tried them.
---
I make ISK with doing green combat sites (anomalies) high sec only + escalation + salvage , mostly afk, with 3 mil per site average. 20-30 mil per hour. 
---
Of course using a VNI carries zero costs , but I do it also with missile boats because I love auto target missiles. 
---
Please note that most of that ISK comes from the drop of the escalation and some lucky drops per site.  I got once a lucky drop of 200 mil from one anomaly but that happened only once, I do get 30-50 mil drops at time but rarely. I escalate every 10-15 sites. You can do this on a very cheap Alpha cruiser too it will drop the ISK/h but still should be able to make 50% of that. 
---
Surely some of your coworkers already have, maybe you could copy theirs?
---
It'll probably go the other way, that a group finds me while I'm out cruising in high-sec space or mine for ressources.
---
The thing with groups is (correct me if I'm wrong) that they require players to be there when needed. Like when there is a fight with another group or other activities where you need more than one player.
---
So far, I mostly played with randoms who went their own way after everything is done.
---
I just like to venture out on my own most of the time and maight not be there when the group needs me.
---
im more of a rattlesnake person 
---
Hehe
---
I just like to venture out on my own with little regard to people in the group I got placed in.
---
I have played with others, but they are mostly randoms I came together for limited time before either goes on their own way.
---
I don't really have it with "community duties"
---
It's being used to make the case for a massive titan &amp; supercarrier nerf absolutely overwhelming.
---
You know: "4 full fleets of titans" overwhelming. A literal thousand titan case.
---
Same here, I started when I was 9 those trailers give me so much nostalgia. Especially the trailer with noisia, cant remember the name of the trailer

Wow, that was really nice. Catchy music too

Whatever structure they had that made them war eligible probably no longer exists whether it died or via unanchoring, transfer etc

I don't know maybe a crazy idea ...
---
I'm not a cap pilot, and to be honest I'm little more than a noob, so I'd like someone to tell my why this idea is a bad one: what if a limited number of caps were allowed per fleet/corp/alliance? I realize that would give the advantage to larger alliances, but they're already the ones with the most caps, anyway. It's incredibly difficult to buff the little guy without also buffing the larger coalitions.
---
I understand that I'm about 10 years late to this party, but one of the things that bums me out the most in this age of capital proliferation is the thought of a supercap/titan blob being a ho-hum, normal occurrence. A titan's size and destructive power dwarfs everything else on field; seeing one drop in should be an awe-inspiring, butt-clenching experience for all involved.
---
except unlike that post, it is actually factual that you stole over 100bil of courier contracts friend :))
---
active groups for SOLO blops? :D
---
If you wanna learn from dudes, just hit up ppl that still solo frag ppl. 
---
Most "groups" are extremely loose, either basing out of NPC space or low class WH's.
---
the prince patched that out recently.
---
Nooooooooooooooo - hey i tried to reach out to you I game 
---
it startes 24h after you got got the mail
---
i do this 2 to kill pos in hi-sec
---
drop pos in space, anchore it
---
start war
---
unachore the pos 
---
so now i cant be wardeced, but the war i just started will start in 24h and end 24h after it started (48h after the wardec)
---
Yeah, it was pretty much a toss-up between "stronger reaction" and "more reactions."  I know a smattering of chemistry but not enough to know which was more accurate.
---
blops r still kuhl, join the marshal club babe
---
I think by then it'll be too late. Changes will come but the game will be too far gone to regrow. 
---
You should join a Corp though, seriously. Check out /r/evejobs
---

I thought about that, but I decided that leading with an authoritative declaration is itself more likely to provoke a reaction than an inquisitive headline would.

&gt; and while I'm at it I need to say that if you are using AP0 we see you and you should stop right now.

Why are you being nice and giving people warnings about this? You already cracked down on it once a couple of years ago, show people that you mean business and start handing out bans.

What you said: My pixel ships are more important than butchering the English language and looking like a buffoon.
---
Dropping to a NPC corp solved that problem for me. Not that I care that much about EVE mind you but it has removed the useless annoyance of war that did nothing to enhance my enjoyment for the game. Plus I do not need to endure the tyranny of teamspeak which also another big bonus. 
---

---
Do you wear a foil hat? Asking for a friend.
---
My guess is wardeccers trying to find a way around the new system.
---
&gt; So basically, when will this mascarade be put to an end ? Or at least  CCP's bullshit NDA about CSM be enforced and leakers get kicked ? 
---
After shield slaves...
---
Interesting abuse of the mechanic. :)
---
I kind of wanted to see something like this on assembled modules that drop from destroyed ships. That way you see who used to own the module. That would create a market for well known players stuff. Imagine looting Elo Knight's 250mn Railgun II! (I know, unlikely since Muninns don't use those)
---
That  Soltueur Titan :D 
---
REEEEEE CCP ANNOUNCED MONTHS AGO THEY WERE NERFING ANOMS HOW DID THEY KNOW LAST WEEK?!!
---
don't forget BOB knowing where goosn were building their supers and titans at
---
and BOB getting admin assistance from CCP to scan down Steve the titan.
---
oh w8...neither of those have proof. bit like your claim.
---
derp derpity derp derp
---
God saves a kitten for every delve excav killed
---
for now this is legal but ccp might declare it exploit
---
What's winning in Farmville? What's winning in World of Warcraft? I used to play a game called RF Online, the official servers were pretty shit so there were tons of private ones. Admins would often sell the best gear. You could feasibly get that gear as a regular person but it was hella hard.
---
Pay 2 Win has always been pay to skip. Very few games have things in them that are actually better and unobtainable by regular users. Like WoT and War Thunder do have some tanks that can only be bought but they're not particularly better then normal versions (which also can be unlocked with cash instead of grinding all the way up there).
---
P2Win means pay to get an advantage, not pay to get an instant win, no game sells that :|
---
And yes the loss part is something, something I mentioned myself. So only some of the truly foolish or rich risk stupid stuff, like frankthebank. But as you and I both mentioned SP is not something you can take away and is regularly paid for.
---
So yes if you are expecting to pay cash and instantly win a game then no EvE isn't that. However P2W is just a meme name basically, never do you instantly win by paying money. It wouldn't even be fun for the people who paid, they want to feel better but still something they achieved themselves. Especially if it doesn't even give them an advantage that can't be attained normally (even if most people don't because of how much time) then they can be like HA I'M BETTER! I JUST PAID MONEY BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY YOU COULD HAVE THE SAME SHIT YOU SUCK.
---
yes  1.  put pos in space 2. declare wars 3. scoop pos 4...  war immunity
---
its pos anchoring related. 
---
True, only thing bob got were t2 bpos from a match fixed lottery. But that wasnt csm,but an employee. 
---
No loot truck? Fail
---
Im considering quitting EVE after 5 years because of this horrible "face".
---
well not for long. ccp will declare it exploit
---
Lol it was over 2 days ago but something like orlien I can't remember
---
&gt; The awards ceremony finally culminated with the winner for ‚ÄúBest Sex Scene,‚Äù which involved multiple participants and a Fedo.

OwO what's this? 
---
You know you can buy injectors from the market, with isk right? Why the fuck else would you krab as a new player, considering the ships you can effectively fly are dirt cheap anyway? Yes the extractor used originated from real money. So does plex. We should remove plex as well then, and everyone has to sub so it's fair right?
---
I specifically stated that I want skill injectors, it's very clearly written. Then again expecting basic reading comprehension on reddit is probably too much, because kneejerk downboating shit and circlewhining without really understanding what you're crying about is much easier than not being retarded.
---
So can this person shoot us and can we shoot him right now or not? The war ends in 24 hours.
---
Been almost a week and read it just so its stop showing in my inbox: if their aim for achievement was a carrier though... than they won.
---
I get the definition(s) entirely and yes goals and winning are objectively two things. A goal is kind of like a step or a milestone to /winning/ but again if their only goal or objective was to get into a carrier than... they won that objective. Via Visa or via in time they acquired it. Dont really care but uhhh, yeah.
---
Anyways. It's kind of perspective to it. I.g. a man wants to be homeless due to not wanting to pay Bill's or deal with modern society... and so they become.homeless and dont care about their debts.  In that perspective that person won.
---
In a perspective of wanting a titan... but say buying a dread as you continue to train or acrew the wealth to purchase it. Either in game or out of is an objective or goal.
---
I'm too stone for this anyways and it's almost a week after your reply. /shrug/
---
yfw shield slaves were announced 4 years ago
---
so were you joking when you stole my courier?
---
Can't tell if you actually believe CSM never leaks to alliance or just to dumb to function.
---
So meme or serious?
---
"Fly safe" sounds boring. 
---
I do PVE all the time , mostly do anomaly combat sites at high sec. But I have dropped to a NPC corp to avoid wars. I also afk most of the time. 
---
Its not hard to play this game. Problem is that everything is over complicated for no reason.  The difficulty is understanding the game than playing the game.
---
I call it "the EVE effect" or "bureaucracy online" .
---
The difficulty and the PVP side of the game are hugely overrated. The game is nowhere near as difficult as it claims and nowhere near as PVP. 
---
In case you did not know if you leave a player corp it drops you to NPC corp and is impossible for a player corp to launch a war against an NPC corp. If you are on high sec it drops the chance of getting ganged to almost zero. Because the concord times are so fast it becomes extremely risky for gankers to the point of being suicidal. Gankers being mostly cowards (rarely will engage in 1 vs 1 anyway). 
---
I also fly cheap ships for my wallet, which drops my risk to absolute zero and allows me to afk as much I want. 
---
The game also allows you to have multiple accounts even as Alpha. So you can still keep your main at a player corp and have an alt at a NPC corp. Its up to you. I am not a fan of multi accounts myself. 
---
not untill the war start
---
Nah bro. If corp fittings are maxed out and your bulletins are maxed out. You are the one providing a overkill of info
---
Or they will suffer holy Retribution!
---
I have a 4770k, 980ti and 16gb ram and my system starts to choke at 5 clients on high. Its mostly the cpu choking.
---
That's why I didn't answer, that guy is either a troll or a A-Type retard. 
---
Can we get a slideshow at evesterdam?
---
Can confirm he stole 100b after Hyde and other directors told him not too
---
Anyone running EVE on a 2400 G? Wondering how viable it would be to run two clients with other apps open on that apu 
---
What you said: Grr, I am still salty about INIT being better than all wormholers and let my blind rage post for me.
---
lol good luck with that.
---
Look how careful they were to call the things being fixed in the patch tomorrow "loopholes" rather than bugs or exploits.
---
Mine is really Broken, not seeing any tentacles.
---
Yeah, so you're definitely an A-Type retard. 
---
yeah maybe, it do feel strange doing it like this but if i dont pirat etc will wardec me again and even if i have out of corp alts its anoing having them move all big ships for me 
---
So they joined the CCP Alliance?
---
For the love of god lol
---
BSIT
---
You like dags?
---
I find it hard to believe you're that brain damaged that you couldn't understand the metaphor. 
---
A-Type EM ward, yo.
---
I'm gonna ask you to back this up with something other than the ramblings of a few people from a corporation centered around paedophilia. 
---
Or we could just list the ones where the CEO of the alliance had multiple characters banned for RMT... you know like what happened to FRAT this past year.
---
Obligatory can I have money
---
Can you provide actual evidence that there was leaking that relies on more concrete foundations than "some dudes did some stuff at roughly the same time as some stuff was announced"?
---
I'm all for levelling people who breach our trust and disrespect the NDA - it's something I feel very strongly about enforcing - but without actual evidence that goes beyond politically charged hearsay, there's not a great deal that we can do.
---
If you have actual evidence, then you should contact internal affairs and they'll launch an investigation with the assistance of the Community Team.

Look, he has really strong feelings based on anecdotal observations, okay? That's basically the same thing as proof under Texas law. Everyone knows that believing something strongly makes it slightly less fake.
---
Dont worry about signal if you want to fight anything ever.  just train up cov ops/scanning/the hacking skills and get moving.  May also want to train up some drone skills and save up for an astero.  You already know the basics or you wouldn't have been able to get around the wh space you found yourself in.
---
Combination of botters being banned and various skirmishes and conflicts which encourage pilots to be deployed elsewhere which prevents dank ticks.
---
No stop. There is no perspective. Winning is clearly defined. Achieving a goal and winning is not the same. Geeezzzz

It is only an exploit if the guy who designed the "feature" no longer works for ccp and no one can figure out how to fix it .

A client modification that makes autopilot warp to gate at zero instead of 15km. Makes autopiloting much faster and safer.

---
**Some quick napkin math:**
---
*(Rough assumption that the average botter runs 10 clients simultaneously w/ each computer running 130 watts per 10 clients. Botting software running 7 days a week, day = cycle of 23 hours.)*
---
520 bot computer \* 130 watts / bot computer \* 7 cycles \* 82,800 seconds / cycle = 39,180,960,000 joules of energy saved by CCP dev team.

Wow. I never saw this one. What release was this?
---
Need to remove the nose.
---
One thing I've always wondered -- who exactly do you think we'd be leaking to in the first place? Like, are we supposed to be leaking to Mittani? That dude has the augury capacity of loose gravel. His wheelhouse is people, not the video game.
---
The trick here is that instead of leaking and exposing yourself to a dumb trust-based point of failure, you identify the people who you would want to leak to, and just elect them to the CSM directly. Saves a step, eliminates trust-based weakness, and makes you legit to boot.

I'd hate to meet an X-Type...

CCPlease, make this happen. I dont know about everyone else, but I'll let Katia speak for me to the Joves 
---
...   blink ....   
---
...
---
OH ... oooh ...   dammit. Have your upvote, damn you. 
---
The war started immediately. This was our first message:
---
It said corporation has declared war on us. Fighting can legally occur between those involved.
---
Sad. The tendies my mom made me, got cold because of the long wait caused by lag. 
---
That also caught my eye the first time I saw that.
---
We still do blops, but not usually "solo" anymore.
---
You will be surprized how little info we giving. Help and links to wiki and guides for people.
---
I mean one thing is doing it. That's bad.
---
But *recording* it? That's asking for trouble... If CCP doesn't do anything when proof is *this* clear and obvious then idk man
---
Yah. BK kinda stopped efforting in the 90s
---
Entirely agree achieving a goal and winning are different. What I'm saying is what the win point is... seriously... if the winning point in a sandbox for a player is to get into a carrier. And they do it they win. If their win point was to kill 1k hulls in 1 carrier... than clearly he lost but has achieved a goal by getting into the baseline carrier....my god
---
woah now, we have two doctrines: mwd Muninns and ab Muninns.
---
rent free
---
lol, voltron wasn't even coming
---
why would we come for russians
---
Every science nerd just had a boner 
---
Eve University is a Corp specifically chartered to help rookies 
---
It is a bannable offense to purposely create server lag.
---
Tau AD did this by ejecting hundreds of shuttles out of an SMA in preparation of his keepstar final timer. A GM swooped in and removed all the shuttles before he could starburst them with the pos. He only got a slap on the wrist IIRC.
---
Thanks. It's Astarte, but I didn't want to Svipul an Olmeca and Hound OP like a Rhea-l jackass.
---
Explaining blops mechanics dank videos for mass krabs was a mistake PepeHands
---
.....
---
*rubs eyes*
---
This is the first time I've seen "Yellow Legion".
---
.....sigh
---
Carriers and dreads are cheaper and better and can get proper insurance, so why drop blops. This is the sad truth these days
---
Take the up-vote and get out. 
---
Doesn't Iceland have fantastic lamb dogs
---
:( very true 
---
He was on quafe at the time 
---
Anyone with a lot of experience running Abyssals, is it better isk/hour running t4s with about 4 minutes to spare, or run t3s with 7-10 to spare?  
---
Just got to where I can run t4s without dying (read: I figured it out finally) and need to print some isk. If t4 exotic isn‚Äôt the best, what is? I‚Äôm saving isk to be able to afford a fit for t5s.  Just not sure if the difference from 3 to 4 is worth it.  
---
I had problems with it locking my mouse i had to alt tab to use my browser or anything but otherwise it was great
---
" How you got that scar, Toni? Eatin' pussy? "
---
This is probably my most favorite Eve Online related music video. Junkie XL is just awesome.
---
EVERYONE WAKE UP!!!  WE HAVE ABOUT 500 ENEMIES OF A BRAND NEW COALITION ATTACKING OUR SPACE.  We need all fleets filling up now!!!!!!  There is a subcap fleet up on Jon Hun, and a super fleet pinged to the super group.
---
Carriers and max caps as well
---
#### SENT BY progodlegend 
---
4th ping btw
---
Multiple fcs have gotten temp bans for doing just this lol. I remember blue ice and tau eating temps for the same fight trying it.
---
CCP needs to remake this trailer with modern graphics.
---
I'm gonna go with "*REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*"
---
CCP may solve this the way they solved the Alliance Tournament "problem".    
---
If you wake up with no corp fittings, dont say I did not warn you to be careful what you wish for.
---
Yeah I play strictly in windowed mode, saves me a lot of those issues as more often than not I always have other applications running for ever related purposes
---
Don't Abaddon hope, my friend! Talos what's bothering you and /r/eve will Rook for some way to help.
---
The sorta good news is that it's still possible to enjoy blops (the tactic) without combat blops (the ship).
---
I know, combat blops are *super* sexy and it's a damn shame that the risk/reward ratio is so out of whack. I'd love to see CCP address the problem. But in the mean time there's blops teams that have adapted by using stealth bombers and T3Cs to fill the same role. They're a little more difficult to run solo, since you need to be bridged, but it's doable. Makes more sense to do as a small gang (6 to 12) hunting carriers and rattlesnakes/machariels.
---
we dont recruit based on corp history, it is the person.  We have tons of former PH members.  
---
XIX just wanted to enjoy the moment a bit longer, nothing wrong with that
---
What was the moment, btw?
---
That's works too! I usually play in windowed mode. Everything works fine that way for me!
---
Who was the XIX FC?
---
This has been frustrating me to no ends.  
---
I don't know what I did last time but it sure as hell was simpler than now.
---
I keep clicking that goddamn blue icon and it keeps goddamn adding me to the queue.
---
[Anchoring XIX fort](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75641070/)
---
If you shared logins can you give also the passwords?
---
Makes perfect sense 
---
Only if you want three broken corvettes and 17,000 worth of some useless junk I bought of a scammer.
---
Yeah I use windowed full screen or whatever it‚Äôs called the Linux install script worked for me so I use that 
---
Waiting for TEST to "WAKE UP" 
---
here's some more proof
---

---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcT4XWsr3MU
---
they did this for over 15 mins to try intentionally slow down the system
---
They have ruin high sec for years for  newbies
---
So code do not deserve Any respect  
---
&gt; Texas law
---
&gt; believing something strongly makes it slightly less fake.
---
Yeah, like creationism. 
---
The idea is that if you get tackled you are dead, so tank doesn't help.
---
Iirc you will only see tank on revs since they are slippery as fuck and can sometimes get out of being tackled if they can't tank enough.
---
Pew pew pew.
---
))))
---
Coalition vs coalition is dead.
---
The same people who are getting involved in these conflicts for "content" are denying it. At this point the Russian coalition either has to grovel to legacy or call off the conflict...
---
They weren't even attacking enemy space. They were anchoring a Fortizar in their own.
---
Maybe you should just shut the CSM down entirely.
---
It was never unironically. 
---
i like how everyone tinfoils and assumes that people were reacting before the upcoming anom nerf, rather than to the previous anom nerf. if i noticed the difference in relatively quiet systems then I'm pretty sure people in the turbo krab regions were quick on the uptake 
---
Eve Revations best trailer ever for setting the mood of the universe
---
So you're saying XIX id the Pitbull of eve? 
---
Everyone and their mom knew legacy was getting involved. They're already blue to the entire rus coalition, and one of their members "left" while maintaining blue status to join said coalition.
---
Wish coalition vs coalition wasn't dead, like panfam vs providence last year killed by calling in imperium legacy 
---
/r/evejobs
---
Legacy was already in talks with the Russians to dogpile the Chinese after the NIP ends. The Russians just got beaten at their own game. 
---
It was Punishment
---
ol Neri's RMT stacks must be fat by now, so prolly a lot
---
Whenever I'm a part of Pulse, CCP Loki and I always look for a really bad frame for the thumbnail on YouTube for a bit of fun.
---
I also tend to pull stupid faces and generally have a laugh, so it's natural that my stupidity is apparent. 
---
;)
---
Add to discord server...
---
Can someone explain this trailer?  All I see is ships doing shippy things (along with a good soundtrack)
---
I was expecting a comment on how everything you do has an impact, a la [This Is EVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdfFnTt2UT0) or [the Butterfly Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08hmqyejCYU).
---
I don't know if they're lamb, but Iceland has pretty amazing hotdogs.
---
&gt; Bastion somehow kicking all renters from Fountain and moving their crabs in one week before null anom nerfs hits
---
Bastion doesn't have a CSM rep as far as I know. CCP also said 6 months ago that anoms might receive more nerfs down the line. Maybe you should read the devblogs and patch notes instead of claiming CSM leaks.
---
I visited amar a couple times years ago when I was newer, but the isk savings combined with supply and convenience of one stop shopping, made it so I have no plans on ever returning.  The only time I visit that area these days would be to buy a seeded blueprint.
---
It's called the salvager
---
Joining a new-player friendly null-sec alliances is a pretty solid idea for most folks.   
---
When you do, here's what will happen:
---
1. They'll hand you some free ships/skillbooks 
---
2. They'll give you a skill-plan
---
3. They'll give you a list of ships to train-into and keep in-stock in various places (AKA staging points) 
---
4. There'll be a couple channels (discord/jabber/slack and in-game) to ask newbie questions
---
5. There'll be a schedule of fleets that you'll be encouraged (but not required) to attend. 
---
If your reaction "OMG Sweet! Some direction, stuff to do, and lots of people to make friends with!" Join-up with whichever one sounds good: 
---
* HORDE (clearly the best IMO) 
---
* KarmaFleet 
---
* BRAVE Newbies
---
If your reaction is "Ugg, I don't like people telling me what to do." You might want to find a different avenue for learning stuff. There's lots of other corps around that don't have as much structure as some of the null-bocs. 
---
you're\*
---
I've seen this happen in the case of a corp who left an alliance that had wardec'd mine.
---
Since the corp left the alliance, they inherited any active wardecs their former alliance had (including the ability to fight), but since they had no structures of their own and were, hence, ineligible for wardecs, the wardecs were immediately invalidated with a 24 hour cooldown. 
---
Because all Asians are best buddies and aren't generally very racist against once another, amirite?
---
Seems uneconomical, you get 24h for the cost of your wardec, vs 7 days.  Although, I admit I don't know what the economics of wardecs used to be, this seems to be 1/7th as cost effective, on the face of it.
---
I was once told they were half lamb, half beef, but no matter what they are, they are 150% amazing.
---
May u just give it some time after it adds you? 
---
nahh pitbulls are scary, and Pitbull the musician has talent.
---
Gilas are super low skill requirements to work ok. Train both hull skills to 3 or 4, train medium drones to 3 or 4 same for light missiles. Some basic tank skills to but you don't even need T2 tank and just compensate with bling modules. This is with highsec DED sites in mind, btw. You might have nullsec sansha sites in mind.  
---
Regarding the scanning skills, I was more thinking about an gila with a probe launcher. As it is unbonused low skills are an issue. I didn't made that clear in above comment. Sorry for that.
---
Some day u will tell the story ... "I was there!". EvE is real!
---
Based on the icons on the left, you have a client running somewhere. Make sure it didn‚Äôt pop up somewhere weird.
---
I disagree. How many carriers and supers could be caught on or taking the gates? It's more warp and align time in total. 
---
I heard they have some dank memes
---
Sorry for chickening out of warping into a boson. 
---
Can't they now?
---
Valkorsia couldnt pass a Turing Test as a human being, so I'm not sure what good he'd be as a bot
---
Krab? But look at all this *quality content*
---
Don't cry, be a man.
---
I hope its the last time I see "Brack Region" that shit was funny in the 6th grade but now that I'm in the 8th it doesnt play too well
---
I did a data site and got "Amongst the research material you managed to retrieve, you find the coordinates to a nearby high-security research center." But I received no such coordinates. How do I use this? I have seen this twice so far.
---
like ShotgunAgent just say, the corp maybe droped a allince that have a war whit you 
---
gm shoulda popped his keepstar :|
---
True, that.
---
I checked and it's running nowhere but when I try to do it via Steam it always keeps EVE at "Running" even when I close it down. I recently updated my Mac to Mojave so maybe that's the issue. The delay value is 2s.
---
They should‚Äôve made that Dr. Phil
---
There's giving it time then there's giving it my entire life.
---
amazing
---
Hey, correct! Thanks dude.
---
You cancer has been cured by this joke?
---
Not sure who your source is, but considering you're a day old account you must have been someone I recently purged from the corporation for only just krabbing.   
---
Plenty of content since leaving BL and that's produced without needing an alliance to spoon feed it. We're a lot better than convincing ourselves that campaigning against excavators is "fun".
---
ayyle. update squad. ty.
---
No, it has progressed to stage 4.
---
Will there be no elections this year. Your call of candidates last year was 2+ weeks earlier. Or is it just due to change in fanfest schedule?
---
It's not ruining it. Just proving this isn't a game for soft people 
---
I AM NOT SMOKING WEED I AM CURRENTLY VAPING
---
Elo wanted to be blue to PL again
---
I remember that pohds recently left Nalio and then was blasted for being a pedophile but you guys still celebrate women acting like they're 14 years of age.... im starting to see a pattern. 
---
Shoulda used the animated one; just sayin.
---
Yes. One highly sophisticated playstyle went collateral damage to capital proliferation 
---
Has anyone else‚Äôs family been diagnosed with stag 4 lately I swear last week 3 of my close family has
---
I mean, if they wanna feed a lotta dreads...
---
You stole ISK from Black Legion. I replaced some of that ISK out of my own wallet to compensate them for you being a dick.   
---
Confirmed. 
---
unless you are MasL xD

Pit bulls are just big cuddle bugs. While it's true that some pit bulls have been selectively bred to fight, the vast majority just want your love. I've rehabbed red zone aggressive dogs of many different breeds, and the pit bulls are always the easiest because they're so people-oriented and affectionate.
---
Just goes to show how fun the game is 
---
I'm not having the pittbull argument, but pitbulls with bad owners are way scarier than say chihuahuas with bad owners, even if those miserable little shits bite more people than any other breed.
---
karer ii apparently
---
We immortalize you because we care.
---
We're pushing toward summer elections and handover, as this tends to be the best arrangement for development :)
---
just for once say  "completed their goal" instead of win, so this is over.   To win some1 else has too loose, something that does not apply to just getting to sit in 1 exept if you are the first or u had a race to get into 1 between you and some1 else.
---
Came expecting some salt or a break down of how we ruin the game. 
---
Disappointed.gif
---
the injector price is hard linked with the plex and mct prices: the farms need to be financed and turn a profit, so with high plex prices and no mct sales to drop those prices, that's still only very little profit in a skill farm
---
Join Wormbro or Wormhole Society
---
they'll teach you how to play in the best part of Eve: wormhole space.
---
Once you can handle wormholes you can handle anything 
---
Yeah ok fair enough I'll give you that.
---
Do yourself a favor and don't join one of the newbro Mills they're setup to gain from you not the other way around 
---
You got an escalation, unless something has changed, the info should be under Journal-&gt;Escalations?

---
For fuck's sake lol
---
I don't think I'll ever unsee this
---
Could you elaborate? What's a newbro mill?
---
And if they did, it would be a lowsec gate to stain...
---
Thanks!
---
This is the best so far
---
FAKE NEWS!!!!!!
---
TEST falls on it's face papa mittens comes to safe the retarded child.
---
Or simply inform them that the resources are there and if they don't use them, they're on their own.
---
Casuals can have a place but a corp can't be run to please them. 
---
Haha ^^
---
Looks just like the game 
---
So can we get a legit answer of why you decided frat? 
---
Well, XIX are just plain blue to legacy and their other fortizar in 46DP is a nice jump off point for small gang content in detorid. so it's not like they were just randomly attacked.
---
The add to queue is normal. Your client should then start. (it's so, if you launch a group of clients, you don't have 13 clients all trying to start at the same moment, and choking.
---
Inc. app for accounting manager
---
Any large groups like pandemic horde/brave/dreddit things like that. You're just a tax generating number to them. Join a small low Sec group who are newbro friendly or a wormhole Corp you'll learn and enjoy the game more, and more importantly have more engagement than show up and f1. 
---
Can we get a legit reason of why you decided frat? 
---
i see the joke here. nice
---
It's not all Delve, that's the nice thing. We've been poking at horde for weeks/months now.
---
Thanks for your input, it shows you care :)
---
You're right, if somebody were to create an automated process that could correctly analyze the minute patterns in the exoplanet light curves that currently only humans can identify, Project Discovery in its current form would not need to exist.
---
However, the botting problem is more complicated than that, as they circumvent this system, and the team is trying their best to counter/suppress it as much as currently possible, as it not only negatively affects the EVE economy with the ISK and loot rewards, but also the real life science behind the project.
---
Don't bot or RMT people, please o7
---
Agreed, the sub should cover their costs + profit.  If it doesn't they're doing it wrong. 
---
"You can plex for free..."  -  Yeah, but somebody bought that plex with $$.
---
They want you to fly a VNI and rat for hours a day, making them billions in the process. 
---
That UI. Do want it back
---
 EVE University - Neutral, based in high sec, does what it says in the tin.
---
Dreddit - reddits original corp and the founding member of TEST alliance. requires active reddit account to join, 
---
Brave Newbies -  null sec based newbro corp, casual, allied with TEST
---
Pandemic Horde - Take anyone without checks. Part of the "northen" powers. Prob largest single corp in the game.
---
Karmafleet - Goons (originally from something awful forums) newbro corp. Part of The imperium, largest coalition in the game.
---
you should probably actually name some. 
---
Yeah but the problem is that the client never starts.
---
GM didn't have to. He lost it anyway. It was actually the first keepstar loss ever iirc.
---
Something has changed, so he can now look in The Agency -&gt; Escalations.
---
You know this sub is cancer right?  Eve is better than the shit show you see here.
---
if you know who he was as a player, you'd know he needs a good memeing on from time to time in jest.
---
darn those pesky roamers and their pvp!!!
---
High end gaming sound cards even include cheat software to turn 3D positional audio into wall hacks etc. sound cards can improve performance because they take load from the cpu. 
---
CODE. doesn't know how to code
---
K is just unlocked, I *think* it's KF for no integrated gfx - but word is these are just ones where the silicone failed in that boot if the chip, so might indicate a crappy draw on the silicone lottery
---
Deported to Stain
---
&gt; Which is good.
---
This is not necessarily true. The downward trend is not due to a healthy balance change and increase in content and explosions. It is due to people who are playing in the asset acquisition route having reached the endgame after 3 years of Rorquals, where they have all assets they need and feel no reason to log in. You should get worried when even krabs leave the current Eve.
---
&gt; OF A BRAND NEW COALITION
---
What now?
---
Then read the rest of this thread lol
---
Groups like https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98107258/
---
I've been friends and enemys with sparton, templis are good men.
---
https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006881/
---
These guys are more newbro focused 
---
Omg, take my upvote you complete bastard. 
---
This is in the game. It‚Äôs called an encounter surveillance system. Check it out!
---
But if they make billions, you make tens of billions since the tax is 10%?
---
Must be a feature, like multiboxing.
---
Yeah, this guys are cool
---
its been updated u just never ask to play w me :(
---
I'm not sure if this is what you're thinking of - http://www.eve-cost.eu/reprocessing
---
It's ok, Norwal you can still fly with goons once Hyde wins eve.
---
It's necessary for CCP to hand out punishments for this, otherwise a precedent will be set and everyone will do it.
---

---
Do I need to watch Harry Potter to understand? Because I do not understand. I see Harry, agent 42, and Falcon
---
LOL
---
you mean they cull the weak 
---
if you stop playing because you lost your ship you would have stopped playing not too much later anyways
---
Not really, just keep the 1 online per system limit that already exists.  Then you can create one and only one "good" static permanently if you get a connection that is just too good to live without.
---
Yes if it was only a goal omma bigger plan than yes they did. BUT if their endgoal...  or winning moment was to sit.. than they did win.
---
Also no. Somebody or some THING does not have to lose for it to be considered winning. Think sudoku, or solitaire, uhhh... you know things. You can win without a loser and you can be a loser without a winner :p
---
Russians trying this shit again? Didn't they not try that with one of the first keepstars? Mass eject shuttles to create tidi?
---
Why drop blops when you can drop capitals?
---
It's yet another cool thing that has been run over by the juggernaut of capital proliferation.
---
DONT YOU DEAR SAY THE QUEEN IS ACTING LIKE SHE 14!!!!!
---

---
There's really no big difference between KarmaFleet (GSF), Brand Newbros (TEST), Pandemic Horde, Inc. (PH), or Brave Newbies, Inc. (BRAVE). If you want to learn specifically bloc-warfare and massive fleets where you literally are just another number, then join one of them. Maybe you'll like it, maybe not.
---
If you want to learn the game mechanics and all parts of the game and not just a single style, then check out EVE University. They have "Campuses" in all parts of space - Highsec, Lowsec, Nullsec, and Wormholes. You don't have to move alliances or even corporations, just pick a campus and head there.
---
Honestly, I recommend you check out EVE-Uni and figure out where you want to go after that (EVE-Uni expect you to leave anyways, after you "Graduate") but please just experience all the game can offer you instead of becoming just another brick in the sov null wall.
---
Did he just ask for it or did he _declare_ that he wanted it?
---
wormbro is no more.
---
what is dead may never die.
---
EVE-UNI for classes, highsec/null/low/wh.  basically where you don't know what you want to do yet.
---
Pandemic Horde: Nullsec of the north. largest, no checks(so everyone is a spy. but we take precautions for that).  biggest average fleet numbers.  and the spies ensure we get a fair bit of content.   currently growing, from a newbie alliance to an all in one. with API corps, capitals(that aren't vexors in cardboard boxes!), and even plans of a super cap umbrella someday (once they finish stealing members from PL).
---
Brave: south null,  Legacy coalition.  bunch of a fun guys.  join to have a fun time while still having SOME sanity. gotta have respect for these guys, they probably some of the more....reliable/honest of EVE groups. 
---
Karmafleet: southwest null/west null. largest coalition.  fun time with no sanity. so be prepared for some unexpected fleets.   ways to have fun you hadn't thought of before.
---
Dreddit: part of test, same area as Brave.  but lately they've been little more than goon-pets.  though they deny it.   take my advice, if you want to go for Legacy, go for Brave. not dreddit.
---
Would Stain not be garbage if it had a gate though?
---
Here check this thought of a new way to explain it.
---
This discussion as an example:
---
Of I agreed you would than win. And vice versa
---
Now if my goal here was to type tons of words... success! Of my win was to annoy you.. I mean maybe idk but if it was to get you to drop it than I'd win. But I dont care about annoying you or typing loads of words. Or even for that matter winning this discussion/debate thing.
---
Ultimatley perspective is king and it's up to the individual at the hand of whatever task/subject/thing et al they are or are not performing
---
More like swatting flies. An annoyance. 
---
this, so much this.
---
I stayed away from the newbro factories and havent looked back since.
---
To be fair, at least among the younger Chinese people playing Eve, that's not really the case. They grew up on manga and kpop. In fact, Fraternity is blue with Siege Green, a mid-sized lowsec South Korean pvp alliance and the only Korean group I know of in Eve. 
---
This sounds good. If botting is to be prevented you'd need to make it negative profits for botters to skill a bunch of accounts, bot, and then reroll when their current setup is banned. Daily bans and auto detection should help a lot. But also prevention of the laundering of (most of) their ISK.
---
And there was me thinking that spending anti-social amounts of time playing a computer game was the sign of a true man...
---
Probably that's just the bad air in here... I'm gonna have to yell at my mum so she can come down here and open a window.
---
post picture of CCP Falcon flying hecate!
---
Hey please use /r/eve jobs for recruitment posts thanks.
---
did ever  stain had lowsec gate?
---
isnt siege green korean?
---
Still woulda been a nice slap in the face for that behavior. 
---
I was hoping for a joke about waiting for winter to come. Sadly disappointed...
---
Yeah. You could do 'assembled by' which might still be of interest, but it would get cleared by a repackage.
---
This trailer did the exact same to me. Loved eve ever since
---
what u can say about eggheron ? was heron first or egg&gt;
---
what about system half,cat,reset,arena?
---
imho gate to stain isunnesecary
---
You dont think that‚Äôs because the middle of the model is around that region?
---
I think if you open a full-body picture and just zoom in using ctrl &amp; +, you would see something similar.
---
Must be a global perv-nomenon.
---
At least we've got higher aspirations than gate camping...
---
You can work that out from industrial indices anyway.
---
While that is true, pit bulls are unfairly targeted because a small minority of them have been bred to fight, and the "pit bulls are scary and aggressive" narrative is one of the main reasons they are by far the most common breed in shelters.

I realize you're not trying to pick a fight here. This is just a sore subject for me. My pit is my best friend, and it makes me really sad to see so many sweet bois on doggy death row.

E-Uni was a great experience for me, I learned a lot and eventually became an FC taking newbros on low-sec roams. Eventually I was recruited by a null sec alliance but it wouldn't have happened without being in E-Uni first.

Yo, Jrod. Sitting on the moral high ground about beating on mining corps? You lot are still hitting miners and you seem to give a lot of isk contributions to the minerbumpers

Anyone who quits because of code was going to quit pretty soon anyway, code just saved them time

can i play too?

Honestly even a bling fit blops will have less EHP and DPS then even a T2 fit carrier, like dropping them is asking to just get killed, you need like multiple blopses to even have a chance against a carrier, and at that point the obivous question becomes why not use dreads, there literally cheaper then your blops hull. 
---
It was just legacy in d-g where u ate a fat dick

IIRC he got a temp ban of some kind, but I don't know for sure. Oddly enough, I can't find the killmail email.

Wait! The EVE of today is beautiful. The planets, the vessels, the stations, the nebulae ... Everything teems with detail but it misses this little something, this EVE touch that one found in the portraits, the old intro in illustrations that made this particluar EVE atmoshpere.

I thought they were resurrected whoops 
---
How are we, the players, supposed to get evidence of leaks?
---
Unless some people who got leaked directly turn rogue, like in the noobman case, what tools do we have at disposal to discover csm leaks?
---
But you don't point out when I say wormholer instead of little bitches.
---
This has always happened. CCP allow it for their friends/pet alliances. When the obvious is pointed out they then respond with things like.
---
'Can you provide actual evidence ....' when what is going on is clear to everyone else.
---
It is amazing how the people running the game and the CSM know less about what is going on than the average player who isn't on the CSM and doesn't even log in.
---
The only solution is to disband the CSM completely.
---
Oh I agree, which is why I'm joining in ;)
---
I loved working for this site as much as I loved playing EVE, but I am afraid my time has come to move on after ten years.
---
why dont u play the fucking game and find out
---
i dont think imperium was majorly involved in providence, that was just legacy
---
i don't think imperium and legacy joined up until panfam came south with skillu/volta/winter/tri, at which point it was effectively everyone on the map but imperium against legacy and imperium joined on legacy side as they had agreed to do if panfam invaded with supers
---
the russian coalition that's forming was maybe going to be fine against winter, but they're not fighting winter,
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75641070/

they're fighting panfam/skillu/winter. they cant ignore that winter has called in all this help, they have to call in help for themselves

YEEEEEEEEET

Here's one! We have newbros as well: https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98590532/

Can someone please explain why there are both the old and the new model of the raven in this trailer?
---
Falcon, with all due respect, I call bullshit.
---
I know you have to keep the face in front of this, but you are not someone stupid and you know what I am talking about. Denying it is either foolish, or incompetence, I am sorry to say this, but it is what it is. 
---
Lol
---
Is it showing up in task manager/activity monitor? 
---
big baby. 
---
No worries dude I'm just glad you've heard of a catalyst and know it affects a reaction lol
---
It‚Äôs a fucking pun.
---
Would be if I had time and money atm
---
But right now I can barely afford the time to play games at all, nevermind the wonderful time-hole that is Eve
---
THE trailer. It is the best.
---
You might need
---
I understand. I'll give you some recommendations, please note that different peoples vary on different likes and dislikes and playstyles, but for me these are what works the best on T4s and T5s. If you stay as alpha you'll have to scale down to T3s.
---
For electrical: Phnatsm, active tank Gila.
---
For Fire: Active Tank Gila, HAM Sacrilege.
---
For Dark: HAM Sacrilege.
---
For Gamma and Exotic: Passive tank Gila.
---
You can fly other ships but these work very well, you can optimize your training path to get into them. I also tried Munnin, Vagabond, Ishtar, Zealot, Deimos, Vigilant. Didn't like them. They were either inadequate for me or doing it in the otehr ships is just a lot better.
---
well ofc but you know there is that thing called cynojammer and there is also that other thing called jump range and even fatigue is still a thing. Blops still have their use cases (if you don't have a blob of "friends" to jump in bombers or T3s) but these use cases match less and less reality
---
&gt;Erm, rats use Ewar already.
---
No, I mean some decent EWAR, not this joke that is currently present.
---
Origin awoxed PH while blue/tral... So maybe? 
---
&gt;Sure i spend 10min fly arround the grid to pick up loot.. Over and over again the same stupid solution.. Why we dont just patch anoms out of the game? Would at least have the same effect...
---
It may be difficult to understand, but some people in the game just like a good PvE, take Abyss as an example, then apply some of the same principles to external PvE content. Sure there will be those like you, but most people that actually play instead of just sitting there and insta blapping shit or AFKing or running a script, will actually be good with it.
---
Shoulda worn proper lab attire
---
Just a FYI, Dreddit is not really a starter corp.  The starter corp would be Brand New Bros.
---
With that said Brave would be a good place to join for around the clock content and a decent srp program.  Unlike Horde who won't SRP much anymore and make you jump through hoops earning Gobloons or whatever to exchange for srp.  
---
I have no experience with Karma fleet.
---
I think I made a comment to you about having no critical thinking skills, and once again you have proven me right
---
Russia is the biggest manliest circlejerk
---
Command channels , bro. Subchannels translate. Like when command says "warp directly to gate with TAPI bombers fleet in system", that gets translated to "I hope y'all insurance is about to expire" in the subchannels.

---
I‚Äôd rather have all my drops come in loot boxes that I have to unlock with keys only purchased by real money than a single penny of mine be wasted on anything CSM related.  I‚Äôll never give CCP real money again until I know I‚Äôm not buying vacations for space nerds and instead it‚Äôs used on something productive for the game. 
---
von-hole single-handed killed that playstyle in dronelands
---
The killmail never generated properly and was pieced together manually by squizz and someone from CCP providing the damage logs iirc: https://zkillboard.com/keepstar1.html
---
Afaik he got his temp ban for calling the GM names after his shuttles were removed, but pure hear-say. Tau is a salty piece of work either way.
---
That's like saying alligators are only more scary because of their "bad owners"....they're also scary because they have heads the size of Volkswagens and you need a pry-bar to get their mouth off of you when they don't want to let go....there's a reason a dog I can punt is less scary and it's not all about the owners
---
Here.. have my upvote

dreddit absolutely is a starter corp

This is my favourite one to date üòÄ

:(
---
Eve is all about these kinds of stories, man! It's hard to get them in modern MMOs anymore.
---
Dear Mr Falcon.
---
There have been many instances in the past where known NDA abusers have come forward to admit their crime. We all know this.
---
As for past or current abusers.
---
There have been many posts on these boards where sleuths have provided market and imperial evidence as to. 
---
CSM meeting to Patch release to Release date where they have shown the there have been unusual market fluctuations at very suspicious times.
---
Of course the body politic of some super blocs run smear campaigns against these folks and shout them down as tinfoil hat.
---
Sooooo who do you think wants to take up this cause exactly?
---
I'm sure it has been reported to CCP as well but without a timelog chat stamp and admission of guilt.
---
How does one really catch someone who has abused the system.
---
Frankly I think a good amount of the CCP player base that maybe don't have the coordination or voting power of a massive bloc have become a little disenfranchised looking at an almost all super bloc CSM and a general feeling of helplessness as to genuinely being heard in a game they love. It's looked at more as an old boys club.
---
So even if there is no wrong doing in the current CSM. There is no way you can convince someone who feels completely alienated by their so called representation to convince them otherwise.
---
I'm not sure this is something that can be "fixed" to be honest. It's a situation where if you say limited bloc representation they would be mad. If you keep going the way it is others will be mad.
---
Maybe the best answer is to get rid of it. 
---
Sadly I don't think there is anything that can be done that won't make people upset. It's an impossible situation my friend.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
So While I stay Alpha looks like Gila or Phantasm might be the only choice and if I sub I'll try Sacrilege.
---
Was kind of hoping Navy caracal or Cerberus might be useful so I dont have to micro drones so much.
---
All this fuss around people checking if their drones are working. Pfff. That's just a pathetic smokescreen to cover Fraternity's blatant violation of the NIP. Classic hack urself manipulation right there to bully enemy FCs and get them banned while they are  using every single exploit in the game on a daily basis. I had a higher opinion of Fraternity and thought they were there for good fights but seems like they have decided to rally everyone and use all the dirty tricks in the book against us. True story is that Karer just told his fleet to make sure they have a shortcut for launch/recall and the right group selected and all these are just looped videos of that short moment.
---
now if only you could stop vaping
---
I want to hunt people mining and ratting in belts again. I miss the directional scanner, I was a God with that thing.
---
You said "We" like you had a fucking choice as to what your alliance does...Shut up and keep pressing F1.  
---
Hey, leave [turtle tanking](https://oldforums.eveonline.com/?a=topic&amp;threadID=616866) out of this!  They need nanites just like regular reps do.

That would be like recording a bot and asking them to ban the bot when they know he's betting. Good luck.

It's not a new tactic, and has been used by both sides.

I think the Eve Never Fades video is speaking for another era of the game. I'm personally not a huge fan of "director's cuts" in the vein of Star Wars 1998 (the CGI in SW 1998 look like shit, even back at that time they did, fite me!), or remakes as they usually don't add to the original glamour and feeling.
---
Personally I like this one too, even though it's not made out of actual ingame footage, but put together from the fanfest trailers; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQEJ6I0vxbo&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQEJ6I0vxbo&amp;t=1s)
---
There was a series of "This is Eve" music videos which showed actual ingame footage and were pretty well made. However I can't seem to find them as searching for "This is Eve" has a lot of official stuff and memes in between the results.
---
Yeah. Which is why there‚Äôs actually nothing wrong with joining a newbie alliance and my logic above is total bullshit. Thanks for understanding how the economy works instead of complaining that everything costs money. 
---
OP be advised the second sentence in this post is false. Recommend considering what null sec groups lie or give false information when you make a decision.

Why are we not naming V? I've missed something.

Ah sorry fam, I think my sarcasm detector is broken, I keep falling for it.
---
Nah sorry fam, I think I phrased it too seriously. Hopefully the edit explains my position better. 
---
I like that "Fuck them for asking actual evidense!"
---
Typically one might link the BR so we can all see what went down too :)
---
In all honesty I‚Äôm not even sure what evidence would even look like ..
---
You‚Äôre response should have been 
---
‚Äúwe monitor player activity closely before and after we discuss changes with players under NDA constraints, to ensure integrity remains always in full force. If you feel there is patterns in behaviour that can be used to demonstrate such constraints are being abused, we welcome all and any information you can provide‚Äù
---
1) you pacify your audience with the idea you have automation or monitoring in place. The key behaviour on display here is the community at times always are paranoid about CSM getting the upper advantage over others .. so the attack here isn‚Äôt on CSM it‚Äôs on ccp.. the csm is just the symptom but the concern is ‚Äúdoes ccp watch us before and after these disclosures occur‚Äù
---
2) instead of putting the ownership on the accuser to provide evidence and wait .. you ensure they believe it‚Äôs a ‚Äúwe‚Äù problem not a ‚Äúyou‚Äù problem.. like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt provide evidence so stfu‚Äù vs ‚Äúwe need more evidence to unpack this in more detail, we are keen to see what you see, any and all information will be welcomed .. email csmleaks@ccp‚Äù  bottom line is even if that email goes to a spam folder by asserting you are very serious about CSM leaks you establish trust and openness .. two traits CCP really need to learn right now ..
---
3) don‚Äôt engage on reddit .. why the fuck are you responding to community issues like this on reddit? Now every paranoid tard in eve can inject their conspiracy theory here, get traction and add weight to ‚ÄúCCP May read this‚Äù .. which psychologically creates a feedback loop which results in more of these over time ..
---
You guys really need to sit down and work out an outbound comms plan as in all honesty right now you‚Äôre underselling the rest of the teams work ... this game will EOL one day not because of technical or creative reasons but more to just really bad marketing and community/ communication frameworks..
---
For CCP to get new players, they need engaging new player content. EvE PVE isn't particularly engaging (Imo), thought the rework of the tutorial was pretty impressive. Fights need to be provoked. Big fights. Player driven content drives interest  in the game and makes the news. If there's not a reinforced node catching fire in CCPs data center every day, there's probably more that can be done. 
---
I hate to say it, but CCP needs to stop being a benevolent god and start being an Old Testament kind of God that will knock down a man's house, kill his family, and give him pox just to provoke a response. 
---
Lawl, you said solo
---
the fuk u say about my husband?
---
eve is not a game with an exact path/storyline to follow which is why it is a sandbox. PK is the life and blood of the game. Basically you just need not be afraid to fail. Pursue what interests you, learn from your mistakes, and grow and you may find something you can get nowhere else, at that point, you have played Eve. 
---
Look man the evidence is all right here!
---
https://i.imgur.com/RFPMYrt.gif
---
Guard specifically said in the reddit post that discussed the March changes that the CSM was not told in advance about the anomaly nerf. We heard about it the exact same time the rest of EVE did. 
---
So that's Guard and Falcon both saying you're wrong. Are you still going to persist in believing you know better than literally everybody who actually knows? 
---
\*fart noises\*

Well, hey. He's in a corp with one CSM member, and alliance with two, and a coalition with 6. So if anybody is in a position to get leaks, it's Sharnhorst. 
---
Does he get any? No. 
---
Is ECM really dead? Been reading about the changes in Oct last year and it seems to me that ECM ships are worthless in small roams now, which is what my corp generally runs.

[FTFY](https://imgur.com/a/GMlB2L6)
---
As someone who used to get sleep paralysis on almost a daily basis, I find this even more hilarious. Fortunately, I haven't gotten it lately(and I have no idea why) and it becomes much less scary when you actually know what it is.
---
price barrier isn't the issue, the problem is the rorqual panic allowing and encouraging cap and supercap proliferation.
---
Yeah, what I mean is that if there's bot owners buying 500 injectors a day to replace banned nyx bots, that adds a lot of extra pressure to the market and drives injector prices up. 
---
Yes you can kill customs offices and put up your own, I'm pretty sure even in hisec.

Bastion moving to Fountain a week ago: "LOL What scrubs and morons, fresh meat! Dead alliance walking!"
---
Bastion moving to Fountain today: "What a master stroke to move out due to this secret CSM knowledge!"
---
I know it's not the same people but it's very funny to see the same actions painted in such radically different ways.
---
I wish CCP hung out more at the forums. They've renovated it 3 times, why not spend the majority of your time there instead of ribbit?
---
Breaking news, all the other requests were unofficial!
---
r/iamverysmart is more up your alley
---
Think of it as stress training.  Some need to learn the hard way that this game can be mean as fuck and it is not for the weak or people who refuse to learn.  I mean I fly capital ships now.  Getting ganked taught me to get gud and that a little paranoia keeps your ship from experiencing a rapid, unscheduled deconstruction.

It's called a jump drive

Does that affect my security status or is that legal?

because the ISD has RUINED the EVEO forums, even after CCP said they were gonna cut back on how much power ISD has there.

It is the year of 9102, why don't you just set autopilot for 0km? At least for in High-Sec with no war character.
---
Keep the trends of game development! Every game is trying to make their games convenient and easier to play.
---
There is no reason for a 15km AP, what kind of PvP rely on that?
---
f2p gives you half speed training, all t1/faction hulls up to and including battleships, and t2 small and medium weapons. No cloaking at all, and no industry or mining beyond very basic stuff.

Bastion didnt remove any renters. I k ow a few of the corps renting from them. They even just openned up a few new ones. All they did was move from delve where all coalition  sov is open to all. To fountain coalition sov to do the same thing.

Cloud Temple is a Korean group in Test iirc.

Translation of the client, I would assume.

The EVE client will be translated into Korean like it has been with Russian, German, and French languages.

They'll still play on Tranquility, but now they'll be able to do it with the client officially supporting their native language.

Wangs and some snuff drop pos in our wormhole and bash our (COW) stuff, we call for help from L2R , L2R assembles voltron bhaalgorn fleet and we bring out HAWs to fight Wangs/Snuff.  Snuff and Wangs flee when fleet lands, we attack their POS, WHSOC suddenly swarms in with stupid numbers of dictors and proceed to get slaughtered but keep us busy long enough for HK to show, HK starts landing, most dreads make it off with the exception of the OP, who was disconnected due to losing power.      
---
Was a helluva fun fight thanks for bringing the heat WHSOC and HK we thought we would get no action after the attackers bailed out.

Well, February only have 28 days, and It includes the Lunar New Year holiday in China. A lot of Chinese player did not in the game for 2 weeks. Look at the FRT(Deteroid), they decreased about 1T on bounties. So if you +1T for the absent Chinese player and +10% for the 3 days less in February, it does not change a lot.

Because it would make it much easier for groups to move in and hunt some of the regions surrounding stain since the LY gap right now is fucking huge since you have to, at the minimum, take on the additional region. It makes the logistics of living in Stain a royal pain in the ass. Stainguy isn't wrong that it would likely breed some life into that region, and some activity into the surrounding with third parties hitting at the bigger blocs that live in the area, but realistically it's not going to prevent those big groups from dropping supers on anything that moves like they do now, just lowers the barrier of entry for dreadbombs basically.

Yes, that's probably more a question of playing style, then. For my taste a Gila is too expensive to fly it with lvl 3 skills... It's enough for 3/10s and 4/10s, sure. A Gila can also do 5/10s, level 4 missions and T3 abyss sites, if you want to stay in HS. But most of this needs better skills.

Scanning in an unbonused ship is really between painful and impossible with Alpha skills. It's better to switch ships (set home base where the combat ship is, deathclone if the scan frig finds something).

Like vs a carrier your gonna need multiple and likely gonna need logi, I would not be confident in my ability to burst down a carrier before you first blops go's boom. 
---
This means you need to bridge in t3c's or have a fax with the blops, now in the fax scenario just forget about the setup and use dreads, in the t3c's scenario bridging with a single blops and a cloak hauler become a much better solution, given that t3c's with oversized props tend to do a much better job against carriers then slow moving battleships without any real way to mitigate damage.

You poor thing, maybe this will cheer you up. https://encyclopediadramatica.rs/Offended

Ah that's right. I remember the KM being kinda fucky, but I forgot that it had to be made manually.
---
&gt; If you want to learn specifically bloc-warfare and massive fleets where you literally are just another number, then join one of them. Maybe you'll like it, maybe not.
---
Every one of those groups you mentioned has skilled solo and small gang pilots that do just that.  Most also have smaller groups within corp that do small gang and teach small gang.  Maybe you should leave the corp descriptions to someone without bias.
---
These guys are right. Join a corp. I've been playing for 7 years now and it's not because of the balanced gameplay lol. Most people get on for the group of people they play with. If your looking for a smaller corp then hit me up on reddit or drop by our discord: https://discord.gg/hbPvjn . We are null dwellers so be warned lol

you're probably going to get a few "haha welcome to the internet" replies, but assuming it's true: that's honestly pathetic. how anyone could play with people who act like that is beyond me 
---
getting some kind of proof is generally a good idea for posts like this, although discord shit can be faked fairly easily
---
Boo hoo letters on a screen hurt my feelings. Go back to tumblr if you want to virtue signal.
---
STOP engaging in the discussion Brisc... you're just feeding more anti\_CSM fuel... learn when to walk away.
---
Damn, why'd you have to remind me about the hotdogs?
---
Sometimes I wonder how awesome it would be to be able to mentally lobotomize oneself like this, and live in complete denial of any truth one doesn't like.
---
And then I remember that even if ignorance is bliss, you end up looking like this guy.
---
An argument is a competition of sorts, so yes these can be won. Simply achieving a goal without a second party to compete can not be won lost or tied, u can only complete. Perspective in this mather means nothing, ur just compairing apples and oranges. 
---
Hope it comes out soon. I am playing Hades star while I wait.

One why cant apples and oranges be compared. Both taste good but oranges are softer ...see... they can be compared that statement makes no sense.
---
Effectively that's saying you cannot compare two separate things...
---
Not TNT, if you were confused.
---
Leave the rorqs and drones and we will walk away ...

Love to see CODE. And Spectrum Alliance/New order Duke it out while PIRAT and RIOT whore on em.

Come Tayra Impel my Mammooth if you have the Basilisk and Einherji of even Tyrfing.

 The situation got overheated but please Permit me to say this ungankable truth:  Jove CONCORDS all!
---
The reason is that an automated system is designed to be slower than a manual one.
---
You can go faster via a manually controlled autopilot (using it just for route guidance) than you can by just hitting A.

Yes lol they're one of the strongest alliances in low sec.

the mboile variant of eve online is pile of metal scrap.  i cant ever find downloadable apk that is up to date

It's much harder nowadays for a few simple reasons:
---
-You make more isk in capitals
---
-Rorqs with a cyno up are basically invincible and you don't want to be sitting there with 20bil in blops on field that can't deal with reinforcements in frigate format.
---
- Carriers are valid targets, but under a super umbrella are hard to kill, because of cyno, and at best will drop t2 fsu's and imp navy dda's. Carriers tend to be more rare than supers from what I've noticed.
---
- Non-capitals tend to be either vni's, site runners or smartbombing bs:
---
- VNI's are trash
---
- Site runners have always been extremely difficult to catch, regardless of what you're in as a hunter
---
- Smartbombing BS (Full rack of faction smarties) are largely bots
---
The job of blops is ganking stuff. IF you're trying to legitimately fight people, you will almost always lose the isk/war on anything even resembling a fair fight or will get meaningless blob-ganks, which can be done just as well in anything else in this game.
---
This will not affect you at all.
---
The only thing this means is that CCP is translating the game into korean so they can play it in their native language (just like the russian, german, french, and english speaking players). That's it.
---
I know it's not tnt. Just trying to understand this meme 
---
Fair enough.  :( 
---
Yeah, funding the most hilariously generous SRP program in history helps a lot and is a good use of that income.

I think it's more the &lt;45B titan and &lt;12B super hulls that are doing it

Hmm throwaway account with no previous posts, posts no evidence neither. Must be true

I forgot that anyone that doesn‚Äôt understand English is sub human.

Yeah I'm always torn on this sort of thing, out of game resources are great but they can add up fast.
---
Currently I have to use TeamSpeak for alliance comms, mumble for coalition comms, discord for alliance pings, slack for Corp pings, fleet up for coalition and Corp doctrines, and a coalition forum, as well as Auth services for both coalition and alliance, so it can end up being quite a bit.  And then pyfa for myself I guess, but nobody forced me to use that.
---
As a syndicate resident, the short answer is yes. Goons have been taking moons in east syndicate and I believe INIT is doing the same in the west. I suspect INIT is responsible for most of the 1.5T spike over last month though.
---
I actually recorded the discord chat when I left over this,I'll post tomorrow as partial proof.
---
Historically, it has something to do with Germans... 
---
Jawohl. So ist das. 
---
Sorry, and who are you?
---
Never seen actual racism in TMOCC. Actual racism being defined as genuinely believing a race is superior to another. Seen a LOT of intentional use of language and words to rustle jimmies of people looking to be offended however. Me thinks you either fall into this category or just trolling to get the group banned/kicked out of political alliances.. If this is not the case, the recruitment process was intended to be quite rigorous to inform people of the culture of the organisation to help them self select and ensure they knew what it would be like.
---
We were not called the most toxic alliance in Amarr Militia for no reason, and never hid that fact.
---
But I would reject the assertion that we were racist or sexist or homophobic. Many of my friends fly Garmurs.
---
PS This is posted under my main account not a throw away.
---
PPS. We even have a TMOCC video exactly about this...
