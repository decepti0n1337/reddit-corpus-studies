There was a theory that they may have been testing to see if diamond rats can break the damage cap as well. But we interrupted it and CCP decided to roll with the event as an RP thing.
---
I too am human, fellow roleplayer.
---
That's a good point, as many people dock up as soon as someone even gets remotely close in local. So could actually be a really good thing for roaming.
---
Inty exploration was always my fav.  Sub 2 align, good warp speed, and nullification made it my go to ship for null explo.
---
14 upvotes for incorrect information lol
---
Nice idea, it wasn't to say my idea was the best. It was more a discussion about being able to counter a cloak. Even if its a difficult thing to do, it still should be a possibility in my opinion.
---
exacly, the ads we have are enough, i failed to stay in the game because i found it more interesting to read about it than actualy playing it
---
the pve missions are quite boring after a while, especialy fedex ones, mining its good for watching whatever you watch when alt tabbing, pvp? if not the kill mail you would not even know what did hit you at that low sec gate, ratting? in high sec you could make more money mining 
---
exploration and fleet pvp is quite cool and actualy accesible for alphas, but still new player will still spend countless hours grinding asteroids for resources while training all the skills, and at exploration the lack of cloak is also disadvantage
---
Joining a null alliance and salvaging behind a super carrier/carrier is probably the best isk/hr you can get unless you are a god at market pvp. It is somewhere from 200-400m an hour
---
Thanks all. I just stumbled onto the idea of making ammunition and will dig further into that.
---
Now if only we could select a t2 bpc and then buy all the base reaction materials for it in 1 click.
---
Ah, thats really good to know, thanks!
---
Regarding your pos comment, you could form a fleet to RF the pos.

If you fall for it, you deserved it.

Use sentry drones, assist them to your geddon alt.

First - I would completely overhaul how the game approaches first time players. Then make any advertising about that.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The changes I'd make to the new player would be potentially game breaking if it didnt work though - as in I'd give all new players access to...most ships with half the skills completed already for everything.
---
so theres that.
---
Also the World Ark, Xordazh. Its width is around five times the length of a titan.
---
Either the cloaky camper is actually watching, you can bait him out, and then you win, or he is truly AFK, so you can just keep making ISK, and you win.
---
Most interesting SOTA in the last year.
---
every other size scale-up grants benefits in damage at the cost of application and benefits in HP/resist at the cost of sig.
---
Caps break the curve pattern. Although yes, the application is down, it is not nearly comparable to the trend set by the difference between small -&gt; Medium -&gt; large weapons, especially given how the DPS scales.
---
Arguably, fighters could be given a leg up over Dreads (once dreads are as distance from battleship application as battleships are from cruisers), but I oppose that as long as fighter squadrons are prevented from losing more than one fighter per hit, besides, dreads already are forced to siege, so arguably carrier fighters and dreads should be on the same footing.

ADDENDUM:

After long discussions with the human entity "DEAD Coalition" we have completed negotiations with Mr  Sort Dragon. Upon payment of 40 Faction Fortizars we will be sparing the regions known as Deklein, Tenal and Branch for six months. We offered to include the regions of Vale of the Silent and Geminate however the response was non translatable into drifter language. The response appeared to revolve around the disgusting human reproduction activities.
---
Prepare to see our war trophies anchored in Sentinel &amp; Conflux soon!

Such wow!

... and you can't form a fleet to RF the anciblex/citadel? O.o

Can Alphas huff gas? Not sure where that falls on the Omega skill set.

Easy tiger. I’ve not been salty about anything in five years. They did a good job was all. Didn’t think op gave enough credit.

1. as a alpha NEVER refine your ores, its not worth it, sell raw ore or compressed ore
---
2. if you want to do industry read up on it a bit on 3rd party sites or ask in corporation
---
3. use spreadsheet to calculate price of manufacturing and how much you get for selling, buy components and use it to craft then sell but be warmed, if you buy too expensive minerals and forget about tax your profit may be negative if you dont calculate every cost first
---

Find the busy mission running system and sett there.

I remember this. We could have dealt with the 'nado's (at a cost) if Goons hadn't brought that T3C fleet in to help defend him. I was naive and was sure they'd get banned in a month or 2 if we all reported him.

I will say this though, when we told the goon FC after about the dude input broadcasting he did at least pretend to be bothered by it.

Wonderful how that differs from the whining I hear from other nullsec people.

This should be the opening credits of a FW minimtar video or something
---
DT-HG friends also came in the official fleet. 
---
I'm so happy they're getting more into rp.
---
Well, this is kind of how they should test the npc ai. Us rp pals live for the storylines and don't mind getting a bit rekt by dumb things (wouldn't be a story without a struggle) so by doing the testing by screwing with us rpers over story stuff, people are probably gonna have a lot more fun with it.
---
As someone who doesn't expect that the GM's activities should be made known to me because I'm not an entitled hypernerd:
---
Oh, aren't you precious.
---
I guess CCP caved in to the pearl-clutching of Mittens and his trained baboon DBRB.
---
You're probably going to be best served by making a skilling into one specific ship first that you think you'll use the most. Preferably something that can make you isk. A 10 mill sp character is going to have a lot of small pitfalls in any combat hull, but as a miner or a hacker, or something like that, you could easily have perfect skills in your occupation of choice. Get your tech 2 high slots or drones, and hull skills to 5 for a specific ship or two, and then go into magic 14 from there as you start looking to branch out.  Vexor is a very popular first ship to skill into.
---
Fit a T1 exploration frigate and go out into Sansha null sec looking for relic sites.
---
The investment is laughably small and the returns are pretty great.
---
are you actually suggesting people install ihub mods in systems they don't own(or rent) sov for?

When you fall back from war just to click on red crosses, you know how I feel.

Same tbh, and almost 10.

Yea thats part of the problem. Fucking log out. Dont just sit there its not engaging on any level just iritating.

Reddit (like most large groups of people) is *really* good at identifying problems and *really* bad at proposing solutions.

Good job Jintaan. If there is something like impartial reporting of EVE stuff, it sure has your name on it.

---
100% wrong. If you can find a good c5-6 with gas in it youll make the isk for the book back in no time. Lower tier gas jist takes longer. Way better than mining ore in that venture.

No honestly dont mine ore as an alpha do ANYTHING ELSE. You know they only have access to the venture right.

You damn well better!

That actually sounds pretty fun, how do I get involved in this?

I understood some words
---
How does one join this rp world?
---
if this doesn't become goonswarm's new anthem i will be disappointed
---
Just speculation but won’t that somewhat back fire? Goons will continue to mine but not offload the product. Once the embargo is gone I’m sure several hundred of the 30,000+ goons will export and sell the ore rather quickly and impatiently, if I might add, causing a slight crash in the value. I’d be willing to bet that the increase in value will be completely negated by the over saturation that will follow.
---
In what way what you said has anything to do with what I said ? I can find my ‘content’ anytime I want but I did not mention ‘content’ in any way in what I said so what is the point of throwing ‘you are not able to find content for yourself’ at me?
---
damn drifters posting on r/eve was has this world come to.

Put on your wizard hat and robe.

I like that poster!

That's probably two guys too many. In a few hours I can fly through a few regions following dotlan NPC counts and find probably 30-40 bots. Clearly the CCP security team isn't super on this thing.
---
 [https://discord.gg/fUJRaAf](https://discord.gg/fUJRaAf) \- Here's the RPer discord. Good place to start asking questions, getting help, and all that. You don't need to leave your corp if you don't want to either. While full RP groups and lots of one-person corps exist, lots of friends in big 'normie' groups RP too.
---
In game channels try joining "The Summit" "Intergalactic Summit" and "OOC" for a start. The two Summits are public forums (IN CHARACTER) where you can just interact casually in character and kind of meet other characters, who you can then form friendships/etc with and RP with them on a deeper level.
---
As an Alpha industry pilot? Not really. Even mission running will be limited, until he scrapes his way up to higher-level agents. He could try to make a living buying minerals and selling what he builds, but the margins will be razor thin. For the situation he poses, mining and selling raw ore will be the easiest and best money, even with a Venture.
---
I'm sad I can nlt updoot once
---
Move to wormholes, regret everything you just said.
---
Pretty unimpressive.

👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

I don't think I could ever join an RP anything without trying to sneak in an inappropriate name somehow.

This is a surprisingly novel idea from a poster who thought this suggested change out to the fullest extent and understands how it would affect all of eve.  Congratulations!
---
I remember seeing that Kill and wondered how the hell that happened now I can finally sleep in peace again. Nice writeup.
---
I started watching, now I'm naked in middle of store and strangers are handing me singles.

ugh.

/thread
---
Have you mined in a venture?  The only thing they are good for is huffing gas. Which he would be much better served doing instead. Indy as an alpha is a joke for good reason. Even l3 missions will yield more than venture mining.
---
Ideally he will go into exploration and find oit wh mechanics and make isk there.
---
Again industry as an alpha is a joke. Dont bother with it.
---
I, for one, welcome our new Drifter overlords.
---
There's no reason to explore with neutrals in local. Find an empty system. There are thousands of them.
---
&gt;well i guess it was a successfull test of thing to come for null (at least i hope it). think of it waht you want but at least you cant say that null was boring for the time it lasted.
---
The only reason why it made null less boring during the initial days was because there was literally no information about it out there, so people were left to their own wild dreams about what they think will happen next, or what the intended goal of the event was.
---
Due to just how lackluster the outcome of this event i'm fairly confident that there was no plan, this wasn't a test for future things, this was literally someone at ccp throwing shit at the wall and hoping it would stick. It didn't.
---
I gave you a fiver and your didn't even notice!
---
Absolutely love localthreat. I have a bunch of backup local checkers but that is the best one by far!
---
lol tis nothing. I have 6 skills in a queue that will take more than a full year.
---
I *may* have sponsored it to flex.
---
Feel like a war is coming
---
An idle person that's not engaging should probably just be forcefully logged off by CCP.
---
But everyone will game this by having a script to wiggle the mouse.
---
It also raises the question of being idle while docked. That person has the potential to undock at a moment's notice. Is a docked person objectively any more or less irritating than idle in space?
---
Subjectively, idle docked is likely to be on the defender's side, so that person's presence is reassuring to the defender and an irritation to the attacker.
---
You aren't a stranger 😉
---
What?
---
Salvaging behind a super is like 60m/hr with a decent player. Maybe 100m/hr with really good skills and paying attention.
---
Oh honey, ain't nobody stranger.
---
Always
---
No. Just no.
---
Yep
---
Respect
---
I suppose you could say that about any fuel then. Nothing wrong with logging off or docking up. I've been in wormholes, last I checked you can't do anything when you're cloaked. Play the game right and a 4 hour fuel supply should last you a few weeks.
---
At least docked I can find you. To come kill me I would see you undock. while your cloaky camping my system you could be anywhere. At least docked I KNOW WHERE YOU 
---
Worse for NS cuz you can see them on local so they just afk till your guard is down then poof im in your site killing your ship. I dont think sitting cloaked in a system even as a scout all day is good for the game. Even for wh space.
---
4th of july...they're drunk camping and losing digits to fireworks.  Got you non-Americans are so dumb
---
Be clever about it and you would probably be good. We are not like all super uptight about everything.

Ohh Thanks, Sir - Your comments are much apreciated

Thank you!

Oh, this guy. After they used input broadcasting coercers in a fleet against us we evicted their wormhole. Killed like 160b of their shit.

Suggestions for a revamp:
---
1. No docking rights at a citadel in a system your faction does not control.  These are just too powerful and completely removes the benefits of having a station in system.  You used to be able to put up a POS to siege a system but that required dedicated effort to maintain an FOB in hostile territory.  Maybe have an outpost citadel that is really bare bones capabilities. 
---
2. Add a mini-plex that only allows T1 frigs.  The pirate and faction frigs are just too OP against most T1 frigs unless it's a niche fit as a hard counter against a specific enemy fit that you know they are flying
---
3. Get rid of the FW missions and make FW actual warfare...PvP...NOT PvE. Isk should be earned on the field of battle, not in a mostly protected mission complex.  
---
4. provide incentives for FW participation and victories that is more than just LP (isk).  Maybe make specific skins or even specific ships that can only be flown by a FW toon. You drop your faction and you can still keep the ship, you just can't fly it.  i.e. Active Duty Navy Comet has a 4th mid or maybe a higher base speed than a regular FNC. Maybe give a special FW toon only skill injector that helps noob pilots get SP faster via participation in FW. 
---
5. Set up an LP exchange where FW only players can swap LP for other in game assets including isk with other FW players.  Extend this so that corps and alliance can do the same for their players
---
6. Anyone not in FW activating a FW plex gate gets a suspect timer until they leave the plex.
---
7. Special events, say a weekly pirate clean out where you get LP for cleaning out pirates from FW space
---
8. Sprinkle a couple WH's that if you find and take them act as a tunnel between Gal/Cal and Amarr/Minnie space to promote easier cross pollination of the two war zones.
---
I could think of more if I actually put more than 15 minutes into this.  As a long time FW player it's a bit sad to see what has become of the warzone.  It's definitely not what is was a few years ago and not really noob friendly.
---
Sure, but if you are being hunted they will kill your cynos or scram you before you can be webbed into warp.
---
Basically if you are untanked you make yourself a target. If you are tanked you can have all those other protections in addition to being to economically viable to kill.
---
Why RF a citadel? There's so many, it won't impact anything and itll come out of RF in a totally different TZ.
---
Yeah. Hull tanked

---
hmmmmmmmm
---
So amongst bunch of Abaddon role players there is a Leshak piloted by someone wearing triglavian suit
---
Triglavian assisting Amarr confirmed?
---
Make sure it's enabled on your overview first
---
Don't shoot! This my alt. Tryranos know me!
---
I like it
---
Obviously the sig to ehp comparison is fine, but yes you're right, the damage/application does not follow the same path as subcaps, however the cost and a couple other factors also offsets that.
---
  
---
The only weapon system that is comparable in tracking for a dread is Haws which, while still having very good dps, is nothing compared to their damage with capital guns. The tracking, which is decent, still needs help from multiple application mods to really shine. When it does shine, it's very strong, but then to get the good tracking PLUS crazy damage, you need to be sieged, a fair trade off I think.
---
Carriers are a little bit different since, as you said, fighter squadrons are weird when compared to other ships, but still a carrier is definitely lower dps than a dread, but tracks a bit better. The cost of a carrier, at this point, is what I find to be out of whack, since you can get all of that for half the price of a good haw dread fit. While still more expensive than a battleship, it should be further away than it currently is.
---
What is the line... Oh yeah! Undocking is consent to PvE. Don't undock if you don't consent.
---
I love this and if you were to reproduce, I believe that the world would be a better place.
---
i +1 this shit post on bee guys salt
---
A front line in the war would be huge
---
Like all good comedy it is based in truths.
---
Just quit the game if your us tz. theres nobody that plays in all of lowsec for US.
---
fuel your fucking stations and problem solved that said i do think that they should at least drop some kinda loot
---
next time you guys do a fireside you should video record it and upload it to youtube.
---
I'd suggest making rorqs go back to the industrial command role. 
---
-Give them bonuses to all boosts but tie it in to siege (on the fence if you increasenmining boost bonuses or not) 
---
-give them remote two bonuses (lower than fax but higher than Subcap logi)
---
-give them combat drone bonuses or turn Excavs into Rorq only fighters with damage bonuses whilst sieges. 
---
Make them a true command ship rather than a gathering ship
---
have at least 5 mill sp and join subpar
---
Also remember that once you warp to a site the clock starts on NPC's showing up. You have 15 minutes of huffing before they blow up your shiny Venture.
---
You guys seems kewl. Tell me when you guys open recruitment.  
---
I also got bad rep, coz killing some random tyrannos before, How to amend that?
---
That would mean far less out there than there are and they are currently a massive content driver. You need something to replace that content driver before you remove 95 % of rorquals by wishing it was 3 years ago and they were boost only.
---
How about this as a solution: make living in lowsec more attractive. Lowsec is in dire need of some form of reliable income that people will fight over. If lowsec life becomes more attractive people will move in and lowsec gets around many of the mechanics that makes nullsec such a pain.
---
Nothing wrong with that :)
---
Easy to say...
---
Interesting. To what end?
---
And Sarum gave you what in return? 200B is a nice chunk of ISK.
---
That’s what I see, the Nestors can take frig holes, you can use dreads, or a Marauder, if you want to get ganked.
---
Interesting. Actually I never played FW. I'm just seeing the idea float around so I figured I'd start a discussion. How would you go about solving this issue?
---
I like it!
---
What? There are actually other people from Louisiana that play eve ?!And the meetup is in my hometown no less
---
Good ideas!
---
Some older Brave members might like to challenge this claim, they would never say anything though because they are upstanding people. Ask them about their burnination campaign, when they took catch initially, some time. They had no caps; they did it in sub caps. It would have taken them months had other entities not felt so horrible that they offered to bash structures for them. As it was it took them at least a month, if not two, and they managed to keep morale up the entire time. 
---
Goons are famous for many things, but mainly just complaining nowadays.

THIS PLEASES ME. I HAVE APPLIED ONE (1) KARMA TO YOUR COMMENT IN PAYMENT FOR SUCH EFFORT.
---
You mean the system that looks nothing like what they originally intended it to be because players mocked it on the grounds of "but my explosions?" So they made a rather knee jerk reaction, tore out its entrails, and have been trying to put lip stick on a pig ever since? 
---
You mean that system?
---
They are in 2012.
---
Or Goons paid Nullsech to kill off SMA ;)
---
We got more RP with the devs out of it. That's really it. We interacted with the storyline NPCs in a chatroom a few times and progressed the story in a way to try to help our chosen faction. That's what we live for.
---
One of the NPCs hit on my character. .\_.

Is there an in game channel for Louisiana eve players? I’m over in laf.
---
no its not

Just rely on shitty intel to get you through

2005 player with 240m skillpoints, I'm ok with the dps in a haven. but thats not adding much to our debate so, see ya in space bud o7

Quit eve online

It’s a bit freaky watching a 40 man fleet jump gate on the same server tick.
---
Man the police don't find that funny when i say that.
---
Perfect.
---
Sadly it's a little complicated. 
---
DEQC left Brave, ALOT of good pvp pilots left at the same time.
---
BO-LD left Brave for Test, they still hang around GE- and V-3 on occasion but also a lot of good pvp pilots left.
---
Incredible bled a couple of good pilots to test. 
---
From my point of view, most of these guys "Graduated" from Brave newbies and left for different pastures. GOONS came alot when Redline was relevant and it might have burned out a couple of people for some month. The game changed, dynamics changed, Brave is adapting. Absolutely not dead, just thinned out!

They historically have a damaged sense of humor

AAAAAHHHHH THE NERDS THINK THEY'RE PEOPLE

Nah, they were bored too and wanted a chance to use their big toys.

Exactly what Thera for.

Have a scout in it, check signal cartel, check the signature,

Then Boom !! Nullsec from high sec.

hows NPC delve these days? anybody fun living there?

I build spredsheets, for a living.

yeah i think my best numbers were 60/hr using 4/4 salv/tractors. looking back i could probably have done better if i left an mtu to collect everything then used 8 salvagers
---
Delit dis
---
I'm sure that will matter for the 5 people left in holesale
---
there are doublers that will double low amounts hoping youll play again with more isk. if you have a lot of accounts you can use one to send 10m isk to a bunch of doublers, probably make a loss, but once you know who will pay back you just send 10m to them from your other accounts. 
---
i knew a guy who would do that 1-2 times a month and would make 200m or so from it.
---
Heron got the best tank for explorer.  
---
The ISK tank.  
---
even if you get killed in one, you got tens of it left from your last site runs.  
---
I sugest you to use Thera.  
---
Have a scout alt in it, check signal cartel website, check the nullsec and highsec hole signature, if it still there, you can gets to null from high by avoiding usual bottleneck.
---
Always enjoy these not sotas
---
1) personally nothing, but deds are still a thing. I'm sure some fools run them
---
2) 6h, 24h, 48h. I'm assuming never is covered by default. 
---
3) Folder level would be ideal imo. Can share temp wh chains with another corp and set those to expire after 6h, can set wh chain to expire after 24/48 hours.
---
dude that sound cool.
---
I've bought drugs with ISK.
---
It smells like bait, but maybe this guy just works at the fish mart to supplement his retard SSI.
---
Man why are you so salty? You stalk our member posts and recruitment threads just to post salt.
---
Did we evict you at some point?
---
It absolutely was.
---
Yikes
---
Im always facinated by the way some ppl see what happens and make up their own little narrative. One phoon had jamms and so its all of them. and then we were super sneaky about it and refitted them all over night so that the next day they were all fitted like our normal doctrine (except from some snowflakes but even those didn´t have jamms). And this doctrine has one fly of ecm drones (as you can see by all the phoons that still had theirs in the dronebay when they died.   
---
To be fair I had only ecm drones in mine. because somehow it has survived this long and I never bothered replacing the damage ones. Now it has none left but 13 killmarks (and is gone die next tie it undocks because I said it...)  
---
I mean think what you want but it seems that way to often ppl just go with the least cherishable (is that even a word?) way to paint their enemy in eve.   
---
And I have no issue addmitting that I found the amount of ecm and nyxes on grid too much. But I am pretty confident you would have beaten us without most of it so it didn´t make that big of a difference for this fight. It just hardly encourages another attempt.
---
Definitely needed, No, DESIRED!
---
You wont be missed bye
---
Ok, like a ping alert that can go off every 10 seconds, just “something changed on dscan” still gotta figure out what it is, might not still be there when you hit scan.
---
Much lol, very kek.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic
---
If the bubble is launched after you enter warp, it can't affect you. So either you are master baiting, or you warped into a bubble that was anchored earlier, and therefore entirely avoidable by using Dscan and not warping straight gate to gate.
---
Uh i highly doubt that, i entered warp was before this dude showed in local, i was mid warp when his name popped up, a 50 or so UA long warp at 5UA/ sec.
---
The tin foils made this thing entirely unbearable tbh. The guy thinks Dominion Sov was made by the CSM to directly kill CVA lol. What a fucking nutcase.
---
NO. Do not listen to this guy. Alpha Venture mining is the absolute worst way to make isk in the game.
---
It's very hard to pvp for profit and isn't something you can buy into, that will be long down the road when your actual piloting skills are up to it.
---
Now that being said there is certainly ganking for profit but I don't consider that pvp.
---
This is excellent sir
---
ikr im in abbeville had to reread this post to make sure im not blind
---
Applied sp, sold everything else to inject.
---
Obvious bait is obvious
---
Is it a good time to return to my home base of Palas and aid the rebellion against the Amarrians?
---
It's the only thing that ship is good for.
---
What brought your interest into Eve? Make experiencing that a goal and strive for it. Eve is a giant sandbox where you make your own fun.

/u/ MakotoPriano
---
iapitans are available to capsuleers but:
---
* they are acquired by getting a bpc from killing one, either player or npc, similar mechanics to getting a revenant but clearly 50x harder
---
* the skill to fly one is a 500x training time but if you activate an entosis module on an npc iapetan its dropped to 4x
---
* it has full citadel capabilities including holding ships, market, indy, etc
---
* always vulnerable
---
* never leaves space. similar to needing rights to man citadel defenses, you need permission to fly an iapetan
---
* 20ly jump range but youre going to need just about every isotope in the region to move it, no gates, no propulsion.
---
basically a ks that can be moved elsewhere. you could drop it in enemy territory as a free staging. you could even drop it on grid with an enemy ks and hellcamp them
---
please remember as you froth at the mouth that this is the bad ideas thread.
---
You should call Daryl B. Friedman, Attorney at Law. He might be able to file a case against those players under Texas State Law.
---
The guy being in local doesn’t matter for the bubble. It is an independent structure and just hangs out in space once deployed and anchored.
---
It was probably a deployable bubble then.  They can exist even with nobody in local and you got log off trapped.
---
Just dupe around with fits in the tool and talk to ppl about doctrin fits and why, for what purpose they're layed out.
---
Test speed/sig tanks with pyfa yourself.
---
You bring those ships into certain fights, think about what your engagement profile should be and what your win conditions are..
---
Or he popped a bubble, hit the gate but came back through into system when you warped. 
---
Also, if you think multiboxing and PvP is an exploit, Eve just isn’t for you. Don’t let the door hit your ass on the way out.
---
The loot box is usually worth around 30 mil on average. Its not much better than an average room in a t5 filament loot wise. Imo they should at least add trig officer modules to the loot tables considering the amount of cost and effort it usually takes to get one. Right now it's a huge isk sink for most people running them. Its a bit like a high rollers blackjack table with really bad odds. Granted it can be a bit exciting to fight someone there, not many people go in expecting to come out ahead.
---
o7 guy
---
Nope. You just refused to fight us, ever, across 2 corps. It's a shame, really.
---
I thought this was supposed to be satire
---
Ouch. Well I’m sorry it’s had you salty for years man.
---
Be funny if one hit a frig on the way to hit a target condor what condor

I am people. When my ATP levels are deficient I crave human foods. When familiar humans are not present, I lack oxytocin.

---
That region is part of my general roaming area. How did he make it up from Delve without dying in such a terrible fit? I've died around there in competently-fit ships.
---
Meta modules used to drop like crazy with no bp required.
---
&gt;We apologize for killing Bjorn Bee, we saw bee in the name and got confused with those bee logo flying fucks.
---
hue
---
Yeah BRAVE are basically dead at this point. Sunday night we had a thera hole 2js from their staging in Impass, we camped their entry system with 7 ships, mostly destroyers and frigs, instead of fighting us, they chose to bring in a cyno ares to light a cyno on the wormhole and bridge in 13 sigils and 3 rolling augorors instead of fighting a 7 man gang 2 jumps from IRE. 
---
V0lta were also camping ge- the week before with about 10-12 kitchen sink nano ships, there was about 25 people in local who weren't us, after over an hour of camping brave undocked a dozen talwars or so, it was a bit of a stalemate where we were slowly picking off 1 or 2 of them and they weren't getting any kills as they had no tackle. The brave fc then says he's docking up because we hard countered him (wat you had 1 hour to choose the doctrine). 
---
Then we ofc get called fags and other slurs in local by REQ. 
---
Catch was good in 2017 but ever since brave took impass it went downhill hard.
---
I'm all for pvp, but multiboxing is indeed an exploit and should be prohobited. Having multiple characters is fine as long as 
---
1player=1character logged.
---
So much bait you have to toss back the amount of fish you caught.
---
Please no
---
the music reminds me way too much of fetichepro
---
After playing Eve all weekend I went into Monday morning formation (in the Army) and was in the front. Well one of my guys was running late so during reporting (saluting and saying "I have this many people, this many are present"). I said "24 present, 1 AFK". My boss (First Sergeant conducting accountability) looked at me like a retard. Wasn't till later I realized what I said.
---
Jita only. Why bother with anything else?
---
You can also play multiple accounts. It’s not an unfair advantage
---
u/HellkerN is right about the mechanics. Bubbles launched/anchored AFTER you enter warp do nothing to you.
---
It's PVE lol, not AI vs AI.
---
Can you please work on the lag induced by large amounts of bookmarks in the people and places? I get tired of constantly having to close the people and places window when on roams, because I'm constantly straggling because of the excess lag caused by having a large number of bookmarks.
---
&gt;one that can force overheat on your modules
---
years ago in a good ideas thread people were rooting for modules that dealt heat damage directly to modules
---
&gt;boarding pods, full of the marines
---
the full plan for dust514 was to integrate it closely enough with eve  that a carrier could send out boarding ships to other XL ships. 514 players would have a match that would determine how much damage was done by the boarding party.
---
Please come to Delve. Nobody here multiboxes.
---
No gate camps, promise.
---
4 systems are reinforced.
---
I think the drifters did more damage than this.
---
Rens has high prices and inconsistent stock.  If I'm going to have to go to jita anyway to get the rest of the fit, or anything even remotely special, I may as well just go there, no sense in stopping off in rens so I can pay a massive markup on what little is stocked.
---
I say that as a person who has a soft spot for the place, but its not 2009 anymore.
---
no.
---
i think those are called titans
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
but how is olmeca supposed to steal all those mining drones now?
---
LMAO.
---
no thats real
---
Multiboxing is permitted by CCP and actually encouraged. With the subscription of two accounts you gain the option to deploy multiple characters at once. It is in no way like botting, as it is a player acting on his own behalf, that makes mistakes and has to react to certain situations. Believe it or not, Multiboxing takes quite a bit of skill to pull of, as it is twice the management of modules, warping etc.. 
---
You, as a player, would have been able to avoid this camp by not warping straight from gate to gate. (which is common knowledge in null, once you have been there a few times, you should probably take that as a lesson as well). 
---
Ranting about this is absolutely pointless, as in the end, eve is a cruel game and you should not fly what you cannot afford to lose.
---
they're just monkeyin' around
---
Question 1 - Bookmark VouchersIn the current system, bookmarks can be extracted from the People &amp; Places window and converted into “physical” items that can be traded with other players. In what ways do you currently use this functionality that would not be covered by the system detailed above?
---
Creating decloak cans for free
---
Secret Santa leaving a trail of bookmarks/treasure-hunting
---
Spies leaving bookmarks on a random celestial for something (10/10's, super/titan logoff spots, bot logoff/cloak points etc.)
---
I'd be concerned about someone being able to look at ESO/API stuff and being able to see if I'm sharing bookmarks with anyone. If this were possible, I would consider your bookmark system to be a failure.
---
&gt; Question 2 - Bookmark Expiry LengthsAs mentioned above, when setting a bookmark to expire you will be able to choose from a pre-determined set of choices (e.g. 4 hours, 1 day, 7 days). If you were to choose three options for expiry length, which would you choose and why?
---
1 day, 1 week, 4 weeks.
---
1 day for wormhole stuff (wh chains expire within 1 day)
---
1 week for upcoming timers where an ally will come to help on 1 timer
---
4 weeks for the time it takes to reliably grind out a structure where bookmarks on it would be important + time cushion afterwards
---
Please go an kill yourself  (ingame)  - multi boxing is perfectly fine in eve and your whiney bitch attitude will bring you nowhere, you don't even know the core mechanics so you aren't even able to comprehend what happened to you and yet you come here and say shit like multi boxing is in the same categorie as botting... I mean, are you high or something?
---
Rumor has it that this is true
---
Now that is funny if true. Open a 'Stuck' ticket https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
---
🐒
---
me too :)  
---
Life's better now!
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
who
---
It is very true. I’m very frustrated about the whole thing. What are the odds right?! Lol
---
you have my attention
---
This real. It's what happens when leadership logs off when timers are coming up. They don't even care. They literally sit on comms and chit chat while others take over space, leaving the monkeys to fend for themselves without organization
---
I can imagine it happened like this. https://youtu.be/0NVUSOm8Mps?t=7
---
So my concern is more that i dont think you can appreciate the other side of the coin. Why do you think they are camping like they are? There are of course, a few reasons that might exist.
---
What you are asking for is a, generally safer eve, which we dont need at the moment. What we need is more conflict and uncertainty. This, whilst my opinion, is backed by the current state of the game.
---
Whilst, sadly, there are those the might cloaky camp to grief, these are kikely few and of even lower threat. The most concerning ones, for you, will be the  ones who are doing it to create content for other players. They want people to log in and have fun. And are spending isk or RL dollars to achieve this.
---
I am not against your concern, i see your side. So howz if cloaking were to be nerfed would you boost something else to ensure that the hunter can achieve his objectives?
---
You guys are always welcome in Geminate.
---
I take it you've never heard of SMA.
---
I guess, you are missing a god mode?
---
The prices in Rens are laughably high. I've seen some unique price markups. Makes me wonder if people are actually making ISK there with such high prices.
---
avoiding the great wall of text so slimmed it down a bit, in a nutshell i personally just want a novice to somehow have a proper “low” leveled playing field. Yea you can ban pirate and faction ships but then u can always bling t1 hulls to get the upper hand, imagine being limited to only meta 0 modules in novices 🤔, i personally think it would be fun for newbros and vets. Ps..Ignore what i said about smalls and mediums, got carried away
---
Now that's actually something useful and worthy. Good to see you are working on that, guys. Thanks.
---
 iirc the guy doing it either is or part of that corp's leadership, plenty of chat log from various frat/Winter Co. channel suggested the guy doing input broadcasting is pretty well known fact among the group.
---
Hahaha that’s hilarious. Yes that’s the way I feel right now.
---
I expected to see 2 RR leshaks, but that works too I guess.
---
Nope, either cloaked Imperium scouts or hotdroppers docked up or in a deep safe waiting to jump to their hunter in Delve proper.
---
This game can be very harsh and unforgiving.  This will not suit all players and some will quit.  However, the unrelenting danger in the game is one of the keys to it's success and longevity.
---
&gt; I am now ruined
---
Don't fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
Also upvoting for your epic bait.
---
Yes, they are that bad.
---
I'd pay 200b to erp with falcon tbh
---
Yes. Lots of Khanid stuff is going on right now.
---
what alliance are you in?
---
God I wish do you have any idea how poor we are?
---
I've found wormhole diving for relic sigs to be very profitable so far.
---
But wait... I’m confused too, where do the furries come in?
---
CCP Delegate Zero does the lore/RP stuff these days. Falcon's gonna cost you more.
---
The are playing other games?
---
At least the undocked
---
Dude, if you're new then you should not be hanging around in null sec all on your own without properly understanding the mechanics of the game. If you want to have fun in null sec then join corps like pandemic horde who will teach you and help you out with various free t1 ships to go pvp and pve.
---
 Drifters are tired of the Citadel bashing meta, how the fuck do those bee people do that? 
---
then they proceed to doing the same thing...cool
---
Some things are beyond worth
---
SMA imploded like 4 years ago lmao where have you been
---
Oh ya, that's some great stuff there don't ya know? 
---
Whatever happens I have had heaps of fun. Although if a low sec gate to stain, or venal never happens I would be a sadlad.
---
which means you fucked up in the first place. why shouldnt you be punished for beeing dumb/fucking up?
---
No
---
Only Jita and Amarr are stable enough to be reliable hubs for what we need. Most people go to Jita, but for some southern(ish) alliances Amarr is also popular.
---
The part where you are talking about forcing people into the same doctrines rings in my head so hard. This is so true just about everywhere, it's eagles munnins and trig shit. In WHs it's Munnins, Leshaks/Dreks, lokis (which can fit in to pretty much any doctrine due to armour/shield tanking and refitting), arty alpha doctrines, or DNIs. The only time it's swapped up from leshaks in wormholes is really if you're fighting in a hole that nerfs them and it's sad.
---
Or you can get ganked by a cloaky loki (bring back instasliding btw)
---
Impass - if you decide to roam there, don't be surprised to see sudden boson titans on the gates and super+HIC gate camps on your way out of one of the deadend pockets in the region.
---
This get's me curious, how do you transfer a char from account to account? Also does this transfer sub?
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
The Dominion system was absolutely terrible.
---
There's only one alliance that people who don't play the game have heard of and it's not like he's selling something with a bee on it and the name of the alliance.
---
shoot first are a us based low sec alliance and they are good as you will have a lot of fun in there.  respect this guys. o/
---
&gt;This idiot had the time to log in on his other account in the middle of my warp and set up a bubble before it finished.
---
Bubbles only affect you if they're up before you initiate warp. Once you initiate warp nothing will stop you from arriving at your destination.
---
Okay, what's up with the Texas Law meme? I missed out on it during a hiatus.
---
Is it just me or does the black Snuff hoodie looks like the wearer could be a part of some aggressive political movement that might go on protesting and vandalising, lol.
---
Knowing EVE, he probably doubled it
---
Some people are stupid.
---
Allow people to sign up individually without needing a corp. I know ccp is greedy as hell and they want you to inject and plex yet another account for another activity but if they dont stop this bullshit at some point players will leave.
---
this is cool but discord is terrible and hates its userbase. please stop using discord.
---
They're already rich enough that it really wouldn't be much more than a rounding error.
---
Constellation chat would be excellent. With only two characters, you could krab in safety, and also see incoming enemies from up to 6 jumps away!
---
And as a bonus, you can no longer be cheesed by a neutral sitting in neighboring empty systems.
---
&gt;ning late so during repo
---
Now that made me chuckle
---
this has to be one of the dumbest arguments for turbokrabbing lmao.
---
my vni repays itself in 2 hours but fucking pvp overfishing cuz i can't use near2 reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
 
---
&gt;Just to remind you how big imaginary ships are
---
ftfy
---
Making it so that the NullSec borders are pretty much fixed by letting people fill their systems with things that take too much time to destroy for there to be any significant likelihood of actually removing them.
---
Blue Pill or real drugs? lol
---
You are funny
---
You should be, and are if you are in an untanked freighter.
---
Terribad bai...
---
Aunenen. Always a fun time there.
---
&gt;Add a mini-plex that only allows T1 frigs.  The pirate and faction frigs are just too OP against most T1 frigs unless it's a niche fit as a hard counter against a specific enemy fit that you know they are flying
---
I have a better solution. CCP can ban frigates other than the Comet from plexes. I mean, would it really make that much of a difference?
---
They're on the same side, so...
---
Is it still possible to block the address of the chat server so that your char does not connect to chat and appear in local?
---
If so, right before you tackle and kill someone would be a good time to unblock that port.
---
In this case, I assume it was an anchoree bubble. In the time it took the player here to complete his long warp, the other char jumped in from next door and made the short ~160km warp to the drag/catch bubble.
---
There could be 20 characters in that pocket. You could be there for 30mins, and see no-one in space.
---
Other times, you can find a mackinaw off an athanor. Who knows why, but it's fast to warp back to its citadel, dock, and return the pocket to the zen state it was in before you visited.
---
I had the same issue jumping my Jump Freighter to a LS station.  My expanders glitched when I jumped and caused me to be overloaded and stuck on a station.  I couldn’t jettison the ships and dock, so I safe logged and that seemed to do the trick and allow me to dock back up.
---
I’ve been weary of jump freighting since lmao
---
Yo if you're leaving then [can I get your stuff](https://youtu.be/kNb9v-tVqcY?t=55)
---
Real, but mostly just so I could say I've done it.
---
I don't find it that demoralizing. It just makes me feel better about bringing 15+ Merlins in to take down those same people when they're looking for solo fights.
---
Not like this
---
and here i was using excel to write out lists of mats and quantity just to do mass calculations to figure out ME and runs
---
You get caught? Man they're SO easy to dodge.
---
SMA is still alive? I thought they died
---
The guys I remember making PL videos back in the 2008 HAC days were Gneeznow and sakana, sakana’s were mostly solo though so maybe YouTube / evesearch gneeznow. Sorry can’t be more help.
---
why not in a tanked one then?
---
Loving the state of Fade, Deklein, etc. The other day I took my solo Kiki up in post-DT hours. Threw up a small bubble in 8S28. 
---
Within 10 minutes, Ranger Regiment had a cynabal come in and kill it. I decided to scope out the other side, knowing I can't win against a Cyna 1v1. There was 25 on the other side, mixed logi, canes, huginn, lachesis, dictors, inties.
---
Somehow made it back to gate, burned off, scanned a deadspace signature and then waited for 30min before going home.
---
That gang disappeared, and had no kills before or after. They formed just to try to catch me, then go back to isk grinding.
---
It has been 0 days since this dumb idea was brought up
---
This is too dumb to be real.
---
Nice kill!
---
PLEASE STOP SHOUTING FELLOW HUMAN
---
&gt;does not hace anchored bubbles in dscan or an overview tab
---
Yeah, the default overview is absolute cancer.
---
It’s crazy that I’ve played for 10+ years and reading about all this pve stuff sounds like an entirely different game from what I play. I always knew there was a deep storyline but the only storyline I’ve ever known was player made.
---
Cloaks can be revisited after Local chat.
---
You will have the skill points but not the experience, so you won’t be much better off.
---
That's what Happens when goons replace one pets space with a new one...
---
I was in Goonwaffe, had the fatbee t-shirt
---
wore it to a bob evans one day and the waiter was like hey I know that bee, it's from that one game that CEOs play in their free time
---
Not much of a story. I still wear the shirt.
---
This is actually really cool. I would have never thought to play the game like this. Props to you all.
---
Cool!
---
There are EVE novels.
---
i trained magic 14 really early on because i was tired of being given fits that didnt work because i was 10% over on cpu/pg or because i had &lt;30 seconds of cap on a ship that should be stable. early ship fitting was probably the worst part of my new player experience.
---
In addition to putting DED bookmarks on contract as mentioned by others, I quite frequently use bookmarks to spawn jetcans. My hauler will often not have any other items to drop, so when the other characters have a jetcan cooldown timer, I would use a voucher to spawn a can. I've also used it when I need a jetcan for other purposes like decloaking or a warpin point, but don't want to eject ammo or nanites.  
---
Will copying and moving between folders still work the same?
---
Yeah I noticed.
---
People laugh at those who mention killboards, but I like stats and tracking progression, so I see nothing wrong with people being proud of theirs (mine is probably terrible), or aiming for goals and benchmarks. 
---
Nice work on the kills, keep it up. We need all the pvpers we can get.
---
No, his bubble was already up before you warped, which would mean it was there regardless of where the character came from. It may have just jumped from the other side.
---
Yeah hydra, thermo, Kingless, voc, volta, vydra, 420mm etc were all C5 groups and totally not nullsec roaming groups
---
Yes, this means the bubble was there already.
---
If you enter warp, that moment the bubble is taken into account, if the bubble goes up after, then you would just slide right through it.
---
This has me more excited than I would have expected.
---
yeah, multiboxing can be really hard. Very easy to get overloaded with panic and make really stupid mistakes when multiboxing.
---
Goons just replaced sma with null sechnaya and therefore they geht the sma space.
---
So only one pets which ist inactive ingame but partly active in Reddit, got replaced by active ingame per who just joins the blue goondonat.
---
Something about typing breaks online RP for me. 
---
I can RP and enjoy it with table top gaming and impromptu acting but online ... just feels forced.
---
&gt;Is it still possible to block the address of the chat server so that your char does not connect to chat and appear in local?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If so, right before you tackle and kill someone would be a good time to unblock that port.
---
Nobody has found out how yet, or there would be WAY more supers dead in nullsec.
---
The chat isn't seperate from the rest of the game, so I don't know why you think it would have its own address.
---
But I'm pretty sure the default d-scan isn't filtered.
---
What if I told you it was just 2 different people. On opposite sides of the system, both logged in?
---
Yup. I remember the days when brave would actually fight or even take 1v1s Oh god those were great moments in history. Or the gatecamps in V-3, HY- U-Q.... Gone and gone. These days there seems to be more carebeary people even in BRAVE. Looks like if you want frags just get into BB and drop on their unsuspecting rorqs. Works like a charm but after a few dorps it is just as stale as a 3 month old bread. 
---
Getting called fags is content. Mining salt is really fun. I always go by the motto thta if it ruins someones day and I get laughs out of it it has been more than worth it. I had to adapt this after the decline in NS content.
---
Ninja looting, gas mining, exploration.
---
Yeah also it limits the fits used. I wonder if CCP heard of a concept called matchmaking
---
Until some no good multiboxing exploiter bubbles a gate and kills you

Yeah the hadeners and sebos and stuff like that I understand. Would be a quality of life so you don't have to activate them immediately after decloaking. But a prop mod... ehh I tihnk it goes very close into OP territory. Imagine a tackle astero that can move cloaked and have 3km/s speed. Or a T3 cruiser.
---
He is just a new player and didn't realize the warp bubble was deployed. I honestly just lost a shuttle to this last week - empty system - warp gate to gate - I land in bubble, nearly burn out by the time the stratios longpoints me, lose shuttle, warp off in pod. No big deal, not an exploit, use safes.
---
Heh. I would love to see an alliance which would stop all of its ratting tax income. Hmm I wonder how would you get all that SRP after 1-2 weeks of fighting. Or how would they pay ihub fees, offices, fuel, etc.
---
Part of EVE can be finding income sources to fund playstyle.  With decent sources of income, losing Asteros won't be such a deal breaker.
---
I lost a 100m ship yesterday and didn't skip a beat.  Jumped into another one and kept going.
---
I was tired the other week and warped into a drag bubble where the guy, obviously a local was sitting less than 2km away.  I decloaked on landing and was toast.  The game can be unforgiving and there are some very skilled, experienced and patient players out there.
---
I would encourage you to keep playing if you enjoy it.  Income helps a lot, corps help and in-game friends help...
---
Hate to see the loot get left behind
---
They are in the CFC, you were surprised?
---
It says QFC is imploding, not SMA derrp
---
Two thoughts that may help:
---
1. You need to understand the dynamics of solo PvP
---
2. You also need to assess your ambitions in the game
---
**Solo PVP:**
---
If another player decides they want to go hunting and get some kills, they will do anything they possibly can to achive that. An experienced pilot will research and fit to counter certain ships and they will adjust their play-style to achieve the goal of getting a kill even if that means trickery. There's no other incentive - it's merely for the kill. So never be surprised when you're caught and when you find yourself at an immediate disadvantage, just acknowledge the work the other guy put in and move on. If you're not fit for the fight you're being hunted, that's the bottom line. The fun then is simply trying to survive and avoid the traps (Even if some luck is involved) while you do your thing.
---
**Ambitions:**
---
Don't chase ISK. I'm not sure why you were in NS or what you were doing but you're probably exploring because you want those millions? You can still have a lot of fun in this game with a very low cash flow buying expendable ships and fits. You could have probably bought 20 other standard frigs or more for that one Astero. Shiny ships are where a fool and his ISK part ways so use them sparingly when you have no regrets. But being in NS alone is also probably a recipe for disaster.
---
Hope what I said is relevant and helpful.
---
Weapons Upgrades, then Advanced Weapons Upgrades works to help this quite a bit as well
---
a+ kill, that was perfect
---
[choose a better warpout](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77599012/) than the ihub next time ;p
---
rens isnt a real hub anymore
---
Space gorillas are attacking too, they are called Darwinism. Check the logo :)
---
Thank you. You have a "get a white russian for free" card now from me.
---
Glad to see absolutely nothing has changed about SMA and the bad leadership that caused them to shut down a few years ago after they were forced out of the North is still present and still doing nothing.
---
YOU are an AI
---
...what?
---
You can enlist individually.
---
And how does this affect having multiple characters?
---
How do you determine the value though?
---
Faction ships have same base value as t1 ships.
---
Go full meta and roleplay a Galllente who roleplays a wizard.
---
All i hear is stellaris
---
If I can be completely honest I don't even know why CCP is giving attention to RP.
---
I do the scanning almost automatically by now and just couldn't remember which on it was =)
---
This would damage w-space a decent degree.
---
I think you just need to get better at probing.
---
So you basically kill any kind do jspace safari activities.
---
Holy shit the devs are playing along? This is fucking great!
---
Nothing new in that regard. If a system has an FOB, diamond rats attack structures but usually dont go far enough to reinforce them.
---
Did you say you're a CEO?

I heard Eve was in the works in 2001,decided it was time for a divorce.

This is slanderous action. I'm actually close friends with 3 other people with very similar names in the same corp, and we all play Eve together. How could you insult me by lumping me with these other "multi box" people?

You claimed \`zero downsides to the cloaker\`. I'm claiming that the inability to activate modules is a downside.

I'm making no claims about whether something would/wouldn't be OP.
---
I still have a spare market alt that works Rens occasionally, I ought to move him down to amarr really but I have an emotional attachment to the place. Turnover there is laughably small, even in high use meta items that form the backbone of doctrine fits and pve fits. Hek is a little better and not far away - it feeds the local FW areas. 
---
Even with substantial investment and regular updates you aren’t likely to pull much profit. Occasional big buy orders come in as people place region wide spreads to export to jita but typical margins in that are low and effort ridden as there is a fair bit of low sec to deal with due to the regions geography and they soon give up.
---
You can manipulate the market quite easily here but sale throughput is so slow that you run a real risk of someone shipping items in from another region and eating the margin opportunity you built. It’s simply not worth the effort for the sake of maybe 30 sales at 40% gm rather than 30 sales at whatever the natural margin is. 
---
These days Rens is the equivalent of a village store. 70 in system is a good day.
---
Devs running live RP again? What is this, a decade ago?
---
Wish I could play and be part of it but it's prolly in the middle of the night again and I can't really play either.
---
You can put stuff into upwell structures (astrahus, raitaru, etc) without docking. Then you could asset safety it. That would be a hack around your problem while a stuck ticket would be the proper way.
---
Oï !
---
Proving Conduits appear starting from T3 filaments, and up. However, if there are not already multiple people inside the Proving Conduits, or simply running T3 filaments and above, the gate to the Proving Grounds might not appear.
---
Darwinism logo looks a whole lot more like a chimpanzee
---
Very nice, shame about the contest tho
---
It's definitely a rather different style to face-to-face rp, and can take a bit of getting used to if you've not done it before. I personally find having a little bit of extra time to formulate my responses allows me to better "fit" the character I'm playing, as I can think a little longer about how they would actually reply in this situation.
---
Alright there bud got any more parting shots to make yourself look like more of an ass?
---
For alphas this is a terrible idea, way too many bubbles on gates that a cloakless ship has 0 chance of surviving. 
---
If you’re alpha you either want to do wormholes, where people don’t gatecamp often, meaning that the cloak isn’t as necessary as in null, or go to some dead part of nullsec like the great wildlands, where your chances of running into anybody are pretty slim
---
Warp to a friendly station at zero. Click on the station and the “open container” icon you would use to loot a wreck or can. A window should open that you can drag stuff into and it will transfer to your hangar in the station. I expect that will get you out of your predicament
---
Maybe you should learn the rules before claiming someone broke them, helps with not embarassing yourself.

Unless this is a troll, in that case carry on ~

I’ll quickly point out some flaws in your attempt to provide tips: nano BC/cruisers are very often not fast enough to fend off the Geminate blob for any amount of time before being rammed. You really dont take anything there except frigs/dessies and maaaaybe a very fast snaked nano cruiser with links.

Curse is a shit-tier pvp region that never sees action. It’s slightly better than Stain but only because it’s smaller.

Compared to what’s available as an Omega, you’re absolutely right. But he indicated he wanted to be an Indy pilot as an Alpha clone. Given that restriction, his options are limited.

Or they could just bring the Comet back in the line with the rest of the faction frigs. Slash away the drone bay and it would be fairly balanced.

Cloaks using cap/fuel is interesting, and I'd probably support it. 
---
Also why do people here defend cloaky camping like their lives depend on it, but then cry so much about people dropping caps / huge fleets on any easy targets they can find.
---
Cloaky camping exponentially increases the ease at which the above can take place. Also I'm no fan of any AFK gameplay, be it ratting, or camping.

For better effect you need to make it darker and sinister. Using terms like reffing isn't something I feel the drifters would use.

Facilities in Perimeter have the best bonuses, but this means that the industry cost index for the system is very high. You might want to check facilities in Maurasi and compare job costs and duration with those in Perimeter before deciding what's better for you. Also, facilities in Maurasi are less reliable.
---
So to noone?
---
NS alone in a Astero is no problem, I regularly find a null hole, pop out, and cover the constellation for relic/data and ghost sites and catches.
---
The problem here is that I doubt OP was cov-op, and he warped to a gate with people in local without coming in from another direction, dscaning, or practicing any skill crashing a gate or throwing ec-300s at the dictor chasing him.

Where can i apply to join the drifter Corps?
---
&gt;you can say that about literally every single mechanic in the game
---
Exactly. I think people have hard time understanding how sandbox games actually work. Games will always have mechanics even if they are sandbox. And it's CCPs job is to modify those mechanics to make the sandbox as fun for all players as they can. And some mechanics might seem really bad at first but will make the game better in the long run. For example making it hard for players to make too big coalitions.
---
so you're saying my bad ideas were actually in development at some point by ccp  ? That's it, I win the thread :o
---
I wasn't talking about Delve. That is one of the few regions that is actually used fully. But there are different problems there. For example I don't think it's good for the game to allow that many players able live that densely.

No, it was something players wanted specifically to fight capitals. The idea was that capitals would get more tank but you couldnt solo sub gangs any more because they would defang your guns

I will also point out, when it comes to jump freighters etc, its not really an 'extra' long trip, it might be a couple more jumps, but a stable market vs a volatile overpriced messed that no one uses, its always better to be stable
---
Those stats mean absolutely nothing.
---
You can have a perfect 99% KB with 50k kills just by whoring on kills with ecm burst jammers.
---
If they took any action it would be fine. Its the fact that I've reported these REALLY obvious bots for weeks/months on end yet there they are, still fucking botting.
---
If its obvious to me that they are botting by a quick analysis of their behaviour it should be really fucking obvious to CCP.

Simply transfer a fee of 500M isk to the CEO and you can join :P

How does one join the rebellion ?

---
Yes, if that’s how you got your stats then they mean nothing, I would have thought that went without saying. 
---
But you can also not be a killboard padder or f1 monkey, as crazy as that might sound, and some of those people might be interested in their progress, their 100th solo kill, how much isk they’ve lost in pvp, the number of times they’ve been podded in their career, etc.

As I said, some people like stats and killboards provide, but thanks for your input, guy.

Roaming solo in a BS in hostile space simply doesn´t work anymore.  
---
The way you can solo in a BS nowadays is that you have to be in **your** space and have perfect intel on some enemy gang moving around. If they look engageable, go for it. They can´t reship and are probably desperate for content, so you have a good chance. 
---
Or bait with a Nightmare in a DED site.
---
On the other hand roaming in a BS in someone else´s space is just pointless. You will get blobbed or dropped 19 times out of 20.
---
Here are some idea's off the top of my head. Not that they would work or make sense, just had fun coming up with something :)
---
**Presentation Layer:**
---
* A new and improved territorial map specifically focused on the state of the war (Can be embedded in Agency) - people like to see what they're a part of
---
* A news log of recent major events like territorial changes, contested systems and major losses (Can also be embedded in Agency) - people like to know what's going on
---
* A pilot roster with killboard/scoreboard and rank (Can also be embedded in Agency) - people like to climb ranks and show off; this will also be a great recruiting resource for null corps looking for experienced PvP pilots
---
* Make everything look and feel epic or serious
---
**Gameplay Layer:**
---
* Passive ISK earnings based on the following factors: (So even newbies can ultimately be sponsored a basic fit from their empire)
---
   * Empire territory owned (Higher means more ISK per militia) - thus incentivising the fight collectively
---
   * Size of empire militia (More pilots means less ISK per pilot) - this mechanic will sway one-sided domination when large territory ownership invites more pilots to their winning militia for the ISK, until the tipping point where it's not worth it anymore and pilots retire from combat thus reducing their army and defenses
---
   * Rank of the pilot - thus giving fairly to individual pilots who have contributed more giving them incentive to go out and fight for more earnings and getting rid of free-loaders
---
   * Average time spent undocked in enemy territory (Can charge and discharge over time)
---
* Open style combat with ticket system (When tickets reach 0 the territory is simply lost and reset for the victor)
---
   * Tickets could be a factor of time / ship value;  (Meaning high ship values capture quicker, but if lost have a drastic penalty to their system tickets as well)
---
      * This encourages militia to go out and camp territories, defend what's urgent, attack what's urgent or sneak somewhere unexpected
---
      * This also presents interesting meta and build opportunities
---
      * Open style combat also readies players for a watered down version of nullsec playstyle (Hunting, scanning/probing, hiding or larger scale conflicts etc...) and encourages role based combat (Scanners, Tacklers, DPS, FC's etc...)
---

Eve isn't really a free to play game, it's a free to try game.  You cant really make any progress on anything as alpha.   You can upgrade to Omega and eventually start buying plex with isk but that's late game, and generally not worthy it imo, too much work.
---
1. I use physical bms for sharing bms to other corps in my alliance (via trade or contracts), so i think this implementation covers it.
---
2. I would set bms for wormhole exits to one day, because most of them expire in about 24h (48h would be more useful here, they can last longer than that).
---
I would set bms for sites (like data, relic) for 7 days, because that feels accurate for most of them.
---
Every other bm (gate pings, safes, undocks) i would set to never expire.
---
3. If i could set expire length for folders and sub-folders, then i would set 24h (again i would choose 48h if that was possible) to folder with wh exits and 7d to folder with sites. Then i would set 7d to all temporary folders (like stratop folder, eviction wh folder, etc.). I don't feel like i would get to use expire option on individual level, because that is too much time consuming, when you create like 30+ bms each day. Using expire settings at folder level would require my alliance to reorganize bm structure, e.g. so we can share exits to one group, but keep stratop bms hidden.

---
In another post you said you lost 400M in asteros. You also mention to play for only 2 weeks.
---
If you had trained for just the minimum skills the training time alone would be more than 14 days. So you either got some skillpoints somewhere or you are flying the ship without a covops cloak. Which means you have no plan what you are doing. You might want to start by going to LowSec and learning the trade first before jumping into the deep end.
---
Also 400M for 3 Asteros? A good starting one is about 70M. Don't fly bling if you can't handle it and the loss.
---
Make a Youtube vid where vets are talking about how great the current game is! ....ohhh, wait....
---
Haven't hunted Mordu's ships with it tbh (and has a point, no scram, my bad will edit), but it has more dps than the arty one, so you should be fine. Will take some time to kill the BS.

Sort of agree with the AU speed, But the lock speed similar to BC's abit to fast maybe 15 sec ish

I made an alpha alt to run FW when Jspace is boring. A few months ago it was bots  + comets + gangbangs. I got no good fights and learned nothing from the fights nor progressed as a pilot. It felt like a huge waste of time to die, buy another merlin, experiment with a fit, and accomplish nothing. At some point Im wondering if everyone is running a pod for FW. The closest thing to fun was rail merlin MWD away while killing their drones and getting salt in local. You get no LP and get no ISK doing this but at least you're not dying for no LP and no ISK.  It says something when you cant even tell if it was a "fair fight" 1v1. Maybe the Merlin just loses to everything and I should get a Suitonia Kestrel. That also says something about the state of the game. FW is wholly unsuited for new players. The fits that you would start with on a given races frigates/skills might not even be the correct tank type for the ship in FW. Without match making for FW its hard to feel like any wins are possible. Its like being pub stomped by smurfs and they tell you to get good. They have no incentive to answer my questions about what I did wrong. In Dark Souls or Ninja Gaiden I can load up a save and continue getting my ass kicked until I get good. In FW it's not sustainable.

Hisec only: Have considered ninjalooting/salvage? You sell the loot and you can make rigs from the salvage. It might not be the best isk, but can be very fun.
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30003968/201907010300/
---
&gt; Also, every single Tornado was named exactly the same. No individual alterations.
---
this is likely due to multifit, if you save a fit and then multifit 40 of that fit it takes the fitting name which is whatever your ship was named at the time of saving. The fleet warping in sync is fleet warp, and regroup. the rest however is indefensible.
---
&gt;From a balance standpoint I absolutely do not understand why this is the case, its not like you can instalock and blap frigs with Large turrets, as they don´t track anything anyway.
---
But you can track them, in your example they are 80km off and will have 0 traversal heading directly towards you.
---
Join a nullsec corp and take your venture out moon mining. Can only speak for horde here but we have quite a few moons that are available for anyone in the alliance. If you like a bit of pvp aswell, the horde moons are great for content. Failing that, wormhole exploration can be very good. It's how i made my first couple of bill.
---
yes please!

Keep this to the brave subreddit

bad bot
---
It's input broadcasting but the way to report them ingame is to use the 'report bot' option so the two are easily conflated.
---
Zig zag manual piloting like sleepers
---
They really are shit.
---
&gt; Question 1 - Bookmark Vouchers
---
I use vouchers to keep important, but often otherwise empty, stations, like Amarr and Jita, in assets for quick destination set. They could be easily replaced with cans or something, but mentioning it here as it is one use for them.
---
Also I heard spy recently activated in another corp and deleted all their corp bookmarks. Currently it's possible to backup important bookmarks as vouchers, and it would be nice to have some backup method in future
---
You can't make 12 people (100% of the fleet) hit consistently on the same server tick.
---
Even if you count down for shots, you're still going to have F1 presses spread over time, and some of them would almost always belong to a different server tick, especially if the command itself was not perfectly timed to the beginning of a tick.
---
The lock time is certainly a big issue for battleships, and generally I feel you don't get a good enough trade off for it. 
---
Dps is not that much better than a lot of smaller vessels and if anything is out of grappler range you generally struggle to apply any of your dps.
---
I have yet to fly a battleship and actually enjoy it.
---
No.

You have to read my earlier comment to understand:
---
&gt;Maybe CCP wants several smaller groups to own few systems instead of 1 megagroup  owning several...
---
Or, as the case may be, quit in a huff when called by your first name :p
---
Does no one consider fitting mods or rigs to there ships anymore?
---
Just one thing... If you get into a fair fight then one side made a crucial mistake.   
---
Also yes the Merlin is one of the worst solo ships but works great in small fleets. Since its unlikely that you lose your pod in lowsec if you pay attention most fly with rather expensive pods. I would say for a t1 frigate the Atron is very strong followed by the Tristan and to some extent Tormentor if you have good cap skills. Amarr and Caldari shiplines are mostly like wildcards, they can work in some instances but you have to prepair the fight before.
---
But isnt it usually something like: You lose to me, so youre a noob, you win against me, you are a hacker?
---
i have a kinda weird thought process about eve.
---
I dont want to rat, and i dont enjoy flying anything larger than a cruiser, and the majority of my activity is small/ medium gang SRP-able fleets, so because my ingame isk expenses are really low i just buy a plex every so often (with PI supplementation, maybe once every five months). I was considering buying an injector because i want to train my PI alt into ice mining but after that video i think ill just take the slow route and keep working on PI/ indy instead because i should eventually be able to fully fund myself with only passive income instead of relying on plex.
---
No.  Most things that get you killed as a newbro have nothing to do with skills, it has to do with pilot error.  You can learn the same things in a low skilled ship as a high skilled ship, but its much cheaper to do it in a newb ship.
---
&gt; why is there all of a sudden such a massive drop in warp speed when it comes to BS? 
---
Cruisers and battlecruisers use medium weapons, battleship use large ones, so you also have a big increase in fire power.
---
To be honest, while the targeting speed mechanic certainly adds to the complexity of EVE, I never quite understood why bigger ships have a smaller scan resolution then smaller ones (other than the constructors just assuming they are purely used to shoot at ships of equal or larger size and thus not wasting resources on upgrading the electronics)
---
Why does my playstyle get nerfed because some null carebear is afraid to undock his ship in a PvP game?
---
Unless you are camping a gate there is absolutely no reason why you should be filling mid slots with shit like sebos.  Most ships have just not got extra mids for useless stuff like that and since any BS will need mids for application throwing in a sebo just means that you will lock a frig quicker, and then never be able to actually hit it.  If you did anything other than f1 push I wouldn't need to be explaining this to you right now.
---
same.
---
each tick, the server computes per grid, the position of the moving entities, the damages, then send this whole batch to each player.
---
That's what your overview shows.
---
The dscan on the other hand require to compute for each entity scanable entity in the system, its position and angular wrt the player pov. Just to check is something changed, same cost.
---
The cost of generating the overview is in si, with si being the number of space items in the grid. We can assume that si = is linear with the number of players n, ie si = si0+ c\*n, si0 being the number of structures on the grid, c being the number of entities generated by player(missiles, drones, wrecks, etc)
---
Assuming the number of dscannable entities (wrecks, ships, structures, anchorable) dse in a system is linear with the number of players, so dse = dse0 + d\*n , and each player uses dscan at an average same rate, the load from dscan on the server is rate\*n\*(dse0+d\*n) which is in n² .
---
The CPU cost of dscan is proportional to the square of the number of players, while the cost of grid is linear.
---
That's why there is a hard limit on the rate of dscan (1 every 4s ? =0.25) per player
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
This is just so bizarre to me. A RP event just for a small group of players?
---
Thats why they decleared war on snuff and after a little bit of fighting they lost their moons and some forts aswell as well as  nearly every battle they took, they put out the white flag, but yeah they are good. ^^
---
Why not both?
---
I agree, but it doesnt matter as they have many other problems.
---
&gt; For example, you can add another citadel state [ABANDONED] which kicks in if it's not fueled for 2-4+ weeks. If structure is in this state, it has no asset safety, no damage cap, and single hull timer.
---
I know for a fact that a lot of small gang groups/roamers/etc. would bother killing abandoned/semi-abandoned structures if this were the case.
---
I think this suggestion would do a lot to help with cleaning up all the citadel spam that EVE suffers from. And it would also have the potential to start more fights once people start taking out these structures. 
---
It's also in line with hos POS'es have worked for a long time which are commonly cleaned up very well by EVE players.
---
Big fan of this, personally.
---
I'll think about it, and see what drew me in, thanks!
---
&gt;Why drifters? Can't players do what drifters are doing?
---
they can, players have almost mastered the art of never turning up to 2nd timers and dying like retards to AoE damage.
---
ARMOR HACS!
---
Yes pls
---
&gt; Only systems next to enemy faction can be captured, making a front line for the war.
---
If the fighting is concentrated to a few systems, wouldnt blobbing become an even bigger issue?
---
I think this suggestion stands on its own, doesn't mean we have to remove drifters or anything - CCP can keep working on them as they see fit, but I think this would help more with actually removing citadel spam.
---
Does "RP on a deeper level" involve the usual sexual stuff or is it kept clean?
---
(im being serious here - all the RP that I know in MMOs usually involved describing sexual acts (but, like, in a *really* bad kind of way), so i'd be surprised if this weren't the case here)
---
I'm surprised at this point there's not yet a channel registered as Dong Dinkle on pronhub with all the brave SOTA stuff
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/character/3019603/](https://zkillboard.com/character/3019603/)  no kills since yesterday's extended downtime for "network maintenance" 
---
Goon strat FC just now confirmed it on his fleet (not sure how much this is worth but combined with the lack of kills :thinking: )
---
Nothing. Eve is life.
---
Some of these could be somewhat game breaking, but i would be willing to take the good with the bad.
---
Because eve is a mix of casuals and tryhards. They don't like each other
---
I strongly disagree. Online DND was one of my favorite DND experiences
---
The comet is overpowered, but because of that, it is one of the few non-pirate frigs that can somewhat reliably brawl and kill a passive worm.
---
Nerfing the comet necessitates nerfing some of the pirate frigs.
---
I made billions there.  It's still active enough, there's less in the way of market bots, and there are enough level 4 mission runners in the area to keep it busy.
---
Stop playing Mordekaiser.
---
I'd pretty much fly a HAC any day over a battleship, foregoing some tank (though the ADC partially mitigates that) and dps. HACs are nice. Battleships are slowmoving, slow-targetting boats. They make positioning and taking multiple gates a bigger pain than it already is. 
---
Apart from mobility, I think battleships need an improvement in scanres and I always thought it would be interesting to give them a hull-hp boost. This means they get a larger though low-resist, non-repairable buffer (in logi-based combat that is) so they can sustain more initial beating than cruisers.
---
&lt;3
---
I think hull timers can provoke response (even for abandoned citadels), and if drifters get both the response and the loot, that sucks for me.
---
Also, amount of pressure exerted by raiding entities should be limited (by the taste of CCP), so if there're enough people roaming farmlands - there's no need in drifters (and there is, if they are not as numerous as CCP wants).
---
"hundreds of hardcore players" aka retarded crybabies like you?
---
no independent thought in my bloc please!
---
listen to the narrative!
---
shut up and pay your taxes!
---
eve is healthy, look at all this content we provide to our line members!
---
why is ccp interfering in the sandbox?
---
&gt; I have yet to fly a battleship and actually enjoy it.
---
Sums it up for me. The only exception perhaps is the machariel as it is a bit closer to a battlecruiser / cruiser in terms of mobility and scanres
---
 [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/skill\_urself](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/skill_urself)   
---
just one of many examples of hardcore players that have left (most dont make such as big of an exit as skill urself did)
---
spin harder please
---
You could just use the market price, but this entire idea is probably not great.
---
I dunno who you fly with, but for bashing doctrines the AoE damage level represents zero and you theorycraft the doctrine above that.
---
We have to broadcast for reps on a fully fit Fort maybe every 10 minutes to rep from 80% to 100% if it is only the AoE-damage we are taking ...
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/ImpossibleCrowdedScallionMikeHogu](https://clips.twitch.tv/ImpossibleCrowdedScallionMikeHogu)
---
skillurself leaving may have had something to do with the AT?
---
And apparently according to the wonderful infographic, the CSM think the drifters are a good idea?
---
The entire game is focused on farming or quitting. So thats what we have.
---
&gt; The problem isnt the game, it's the players.
---
Wrong, so fucking wrong. You cant improve players to improve the game. The game has good design or it doesnt.
---
It would still allow a lot of systems to be contested, but would eliminated plexing in deadend systems that are used by bots and people not interested in FW apart from as a cash cow which shits on those wanting to really do FW.
---
Also the whole point of the thread was player retention. More people in the same systems blowing shit up means more chance of New players interacting with people and joining player corps. Which allows them to learn more and have backup instead of being killed by a solo pirate in an expensive ship in the middle of nowhere and saying fuck this game.
---
As mentioned, battlecruisers cannot be used in geminate. Horde don't need time to "remember" what a jaguar is, their default response to any ship in their space is 5 jaguars + recons.   
---
The very small mordus npc space in Pureblind is basically dead unless you happen to stumble in there in just the right timezone.   
---
Both of these points are covered in the original pos.
---
This. Besides you can blame people all you want, it's not going to change anything. It's really a pointless direction of thought. "People should / people shouldnt". We are talking about a large, anonymous mass. The only real thing you can adjust / are in control of, is the game mechanics / design and incentives that follow from that.
---
Maintenance and upkeep is great!
---
Removing Asset Safety on assets that belong to a person stuck in hospital for a random car crash is a thoroughly cuntish thing to be advocating for. 
---
If you want a person's inventory stuff, only take it from them when they have the option to *choose* to fight for it... or do it in w-space where the person agreed to the risk beforehand.
---
2 hours is a lot of time though, life is short.
---
americans always lazzy and cant realy play games.
---
[look at the corp](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1000274/) there are some kills in null, mostly geminate and some in syndicate and tenal since the last DT
---
Since we're in negotiation mode ... make it 14,5 sec ;)
---
A 40.000 man alliance bitching to CCP about NPC's shooting stuff
---
and getting their will because they are too shit to do something about it 
---
fucking 2019 EVE is great, still waiting on a response on my tiket bc the game autobilled me for another 6 months that i dont want btw
---
&gt;Also the whole point of the thread was player retention. More people in the same systems blowing shit up means more chance of New players interacting with people and joining player corps.
---
I think a strong dependency on joining a corp hurts the game in terms of retention, but if that is what they want, nullsec is ready to take them anyway. We dont need the same gameplay everywhere.
---
New players want meaningful interaction. Getting blobbed is not that. Becoming an f1-drone is not that. You know a lot of these "active" systems will be dominated by smallish groups with 3b+ pods flying only expensive ships with link alts.
---
lmao accusing other people of spin, how fucked in the head are you?

Nah, insane sustain!

Apology accepted.

There are several 48 hour wormhole types.

That was a Fireside, not a SOTA, but nice spin.
---
Thats a high bar to be fair.
---
yeah you can, if you leave your actual corp.
---
true there is maybe 2 separate instances of them killing something and only in geminate since july 1st, its now the 3rd
---
perhaps not completely removed but seriously nerfed
---
This guy gets it.
---
The one above him doesn´t.
---
Even very mediocre inty pilots know how to maximize transversal.
---
I'm pretty sure you can
---
meh
---
quit the game because you don't get your way on (issue).
---
plenty of hardcore players who are not rorqual obsessed in major blocs.
---
then one of us will do something 'cool' and you'll be like 'yeah i used to play that hey looks like things really have changed' and get back into it
---
but nothings changed, other than your own mind.
---
eve is dead yes
---
Skillu being allianced thefted out of existance is normal eve gameplay.
---
The AT had nothing to do with it. The current state of nullsec in eve was the main factor, better to go out with a bang than fade away.
---
The horrible lock time means you cant really effectively engage stuff. 
---
What use are your large weapons with decent range if the stuff gets on top of you before you lock it. Every nano tempest roam I did, ever.
---
This is my biggest gripe.
---
Racism etc will be taken seriously. Real life threats will be taken seriously.
---
Complaining to a GM that another player called you a cunt will get you laughed out of the chat channel though.
---
1000+ solo kills made you think hes an f1 pusher? At least he made u think. Now try to continue the thinking process and focus on logic.
---
Wasn't it the null leaders that came together in a single room and cried in a circle, holding hands and bitching to CCP? I am sure there is even a voice record of the mittens uploaded to soundcloud. I still jerk off to sound of mittens whining like a crybaby 3 times a day. Best quality salt I have ever seen. Are you mentally ill or the best response you can come up with is "no u" ?
---
though tbf it isnt just bloc leaders killing the game, its ccps incompetence at basically everything aswell
---
i haven't quit but lost of hardcore players i know have, there are a lot of valid reasons, and saying that nothing has changed is simply incorrect lol
---
WOW BIG FUCKING DIFFERENCE
---
There's been one instance that I can remember where someone shitposted so hard they made goons redeploy
---
But this ain't it
---
except thats not what happened?
---
Don't chase the ISK. Even a measly 100k profit is still profit well earned, as long as it was fun or interesting doing so. And there are decent expendable ships and fits for less than 5mil ISK.
---
You can literally place a buy order 2 systems away from Jita and have some other muppet mine it for you, and sell it for profit.
---
Worth nothing.
---
So put them back to how they used to be?
---
Shut up
---
What are the trig invasions like to run? I can see the best reward is from a maximum of a 10 player fleet in terms of pure isk and lp, and I know a lot of the reward is in salvaging wrecks.
---
Is the content hard, do you need a proper organised fleet? As in fleet needs to be on comms etc? Are there any groups that run them?
---
probably kills at drifter wormhole entrances
---
To be fair you don't know what CCP did or did not do
---
All good suggestions that people have been talking about for a long time.
---
What can one do to counteract things like, to put it this way, people acting like people? I was thinking a bit about it and I just don't see a solution that is available without shaking EvE's basis (property that is permanently lost and isn't too easy to come by, having some group-level assets etc.) too much?
---
I originally went to Iceland for Fanfest in 2016 that was pretty cool
---
Then I went again the next year because I saw none of the actual cool parts of the country, just Harpa and the surrounding parts of Reykjavik.
---
That big increase in on-paper DPS is mitigated by a big decrease in application against smaller targets in the case of large weapons, and other penalties or considerations on heavified-medium weapons (rapid heavies etc).
---
Get. Help.
---
MAKE LP TAXABLE 
---
alliance income is a huge issue in FW because members mostly earn isk through ways that arent taxable
---
true, if that is the case then we know what the maintenance was I guess
---
nice one mate
---
Agree, but it would be a step in the right direction. 
---
The AF buff hurt T1 roaming BS a lot. Now space is littered with unkillable, untrackable ramjags. All you can do is fly a Tempest and capkill the bastard before he gets to run his 4 NOSes on you, but you naturally have no chance to kill him.
---
ADCs means AFs can YEET at you for 12 or whatever seconds, disregarding any transversal, and once they are on top of you you are toast.  Same goes for HACs, but well fit Deimos and the like already feasted on BS even before this buff.
---
Triangle ships work really well against BS as well, since they chill at longpoint range and happily ramp while you punch air.  
---
Its just powercreep after powercreep.
---
How to fix all this? I have no clue. 
---
Large turrets´ tracking is simply too horrible, they don´t apply on stuff that has a semblance of transversal at range, and yet they dont apply to small stuff at close range even under scram+grappler.
---
They are too slow to force cruisers and up into scram range, even if a cruiser lands close you cant lock it in time before it pulls range due to the scanres.
---
Most BS have 4 mids, which is really ineffective for roaming.
---
They have fat sigs, but their tanks are unremarkable.
---
The answer is Poly-bombers with MWD anchored to FC!
---
\^ this
---
You can literally do that in a Tornado which is faster, locks faster and is cheaper
---
Which is adding more points to the "ships are designed to attack targets of equal or bigger size" theory
---
CCP needs us more than we need them.
---
it s only ccp Peligro that is hunting bot
---
Maybe they could add a manual tuning mechanic to scan resolution, so you can optimize for locking smaller ships but be penalized for locking large ones, or choose an in between of either
---
huge meandering
---
I was best man at another EVE player's wedding. I met him irl for the first time the day before he got married. First time to the US. Good time, smoked weed, got drunk, drove a speedboat, drove an atv, found out why air conditioner is a thing and fired lots of guns. Now I am poor irl due to some mental health issues which in turn has made me 100% disabled. This guy payed the whole fucking thing for me.
---
The Mordus battleship is fairly tanky and has a Scram + Web. 
---
They also have an EM hole unsurprisingly but this means that you need to have local rat ammo and Mordus ammo if you are outside Blood Raider space.
---
I generally use a HAM Loki which has 800 dps and it takes a solid 3 minutes a whittling to down it. 
---
I think the Cyna is likely to die to it as you need good resist profile and consistent reps. 
---
Pair of Stratios may be good if you want cheap and safe and also have an alt. 
---
I keep my other char cloaked up in a long web arty Loki or nuet heavy stratios to kill other folks.
---
Just so you know. The majority of us roleplayers have been doing this for years. Much of the storyline stuff is woven into things from the entire history of EVE online. So the point is it's not like a new thing. It's been happening this whole time and is how CCP decides what happens with certain events in the NPC history they want to have reflected in game.
---
Death to QFC
---
1. Never used them at all
---
battleships should be op. just up every stat on them. theres not alot of good stronh ships between t3c and carriers.
---
I play Eve whenever I can. When I can’t, my characters are getting marginally better all the time. It’s the only reason I have been subscribed since 2007. 
---
If you want to play Eve then play it, don’t wait on some magic skills that you “need.”
---
You utterly failed to understand, so you accuse folk of spin, all the while your biggest talking point of it being a SOTA is just spin from you. If you don't know the difference between a SOTA and a Fireside Chat, you are pretty dumb.
---
2. Used then occasionally to fill core skills/get into very specific ships/doctrines.
---
ordinary miner wont mine gas and gas cloud harvesters are quite expensive, it doesnt sound expensive but risk is high because wormhole is not only full of drifters after 15 minutes, there are also cloaked ships
---
There use to be a time in EvE when you would jump in to a lowsec system in a frigate, and Tempest would be instalocking and killing you before you can warp. 
---
Good times.
---
3. Used a lot of them to instantly make Rorq/carrier/titan pilot.
---
4. Other (please explain)
---
Losing 100mil astero fits in nullsec by the dozen.
---
Used a bunch to finish a FAX alt a year ago. Thats it
---
How about 22.7 sec?
---
I just down voted all of the options, just to watch the world burn.
---
I don't think battleships are supposed to be able to effectively engage smaller ships at close range.
---
With the recent explosion of the blue donut local markets are in null, all the hi sec pubbies have moved there for a better life.
---
HAC is way more expensive and worse insurance payout though
---
Please don't downvote one? You new to this sub eh?
---
not sure why this got downvoted because this actually works pretty reliably especially with newish characters
---
just make FW NPC fleets fight each other and spice up the story a little that's likely all thats needed to get FW going seriously.
---
sorry that i don't know specific goon jargon guess that makes me dumb?
---
So BSs are supposed to fight caps with that logic? Lets give BS ability to speedtank caps&amp;supers and whole problem is solved. Also enough DPS that it can solo kill self rep carry/rorq. Retarded problems require retarded solutions.
---
you have no idea what you’re talking about, do you?
---
Oh, you didn't know? The CFC never changed its name nor ever lost most of its core membership. It is also mid 2015 right now.
---
Most pirate battleships are fast enough to make roaming in them not complete cancer, but for t1 BS I feel like the best place for them is FW lowsec, since you just need to keep them in a busy system and not have to worry about spending an hour moving it half a dozen jumps.  The issue with kiting pirate BSes is that they are basically coffins without light support.  I try to fly battleships every chance I get so making T1 battleships, and maybe battleships in general not complete trash tier would be nice.
---
Keep in mind that every slot or tank you add to make roaming more fun  can also be (ab)used in other environments.
---
4. My 2nd main char was very heavily trained into caps, rorq and supers during my time with Circle of Two and upon its collapse I had no interest in flying or owning such ships. 
---
I sold off all my big ships and re-injected all the skills points. Can't remember how much I started with but after going down to 5mill SP and reinjecting I had 62mill SP.
---
I then put all the skills points into making the account a perfect frigate pilot.
---
That means all small gun and support skills V all tank and navigation V ect.
---
I do not regret it one bit the char just finished its last cruiser V and just need to finish medium pulse laser specialization V then I am going to work on T2 all T2 cruiser ships V.
---
only used them once to get Logi V
---
Snowflakes like you are what caused all that asset safety shit to come to being in the first place, boo fucking hoo if you are stuck in a hospital. 
---
Are we going to adapt the game to every IRL inconvenience possible to give everyone a choice to lose their shit?
---
What about a dude moving shit in a hauler while being drunk/depressed or some other shit? You going to reimburse his dropped loot as well because he's incapable of consenting to PvP? What if a minor plays EvE, do you plan to reimburse their shit too because they can't make their own decisions? Or a paraplegic guy who's controller stopped working mid fight, what about him?
---
Are you implying that someone who focuses on a certain type of gameplay is better at it than people that dont?
---
Hey, I'm looking for a comment here on Reddit, where a guy was explaining why EVE is the best game. It was something like  : "In EVE, you can be... a pirate doing this and this.. but in EVE you can also be.. a guy in the dark managing a corporation..". It was a comment in 2 parts if I remember correctly.
---
But you have to use it immediatly to keep your ship in shape
---
Yeah in the normal eve sub fashion this has immediately backfired
---
Simple solution: delete all capital ships from the game
---
Most good null alliances farm their own Faction and dedspace stuff, or just buy in Jita where they are selling most of their overstock anyway. Rens is insignificant.
---
lol when Goons suggest this / something similar it gets voted down but when it's somebody else it's a great idea
---
Oh it is, but still, alliances like test need shield dedspace mods from guri space.
---
Most RP does not involve sexual activities.
---
And one militia noob in a boosher ruins their day? Or they have to come into a plex at zero with the large force already setup inside.
---
Good luck with that.
---
EVE 2.0 is way overdue. The current game has been broken for a long time.
---
Obviously go with long rage targeting script. Start locking that inty from 200km away. Then maybe you'll have it locked by the time it reaches scram range.
---
Might be, but such a philosophy would heavily imply that BS are only supposed to be used in fleets.
---
Also, why can caps blap and point whatever stuff and infinite range, and BS can´t do jack?
---
It was always my feeling that caps should be the subcap dependent class, and not BS.
---
Oh I’m talking like ev0ke and friends.
---
Sounds like skill injectors are a band aid fix to a fundamentally bad game design?
---
I extracted a bunch of characters I had since 2003, which were totally unfocused, bit of everything but very high SP, then injected some brand new specialists.  It was like starting over wiping all accounts and then doing what I would have done had I known what Eve was about from day 1.
---
We may never know.
---
Battleships are indeed supposed to fight battleships and capitals. Capitals tracking them (and smaller ships) too well is a whole different ballpark.
---
It is also possible to kill self rep carriers (bring a lot of ammo though), while Rorquals might need a balance shift from active tank towards buffer
---
No you can't change your char name
---
but m4H BHlg0rn
---
Oh for sure, stuff like Mach, Vindi or Nightmare can function semi-independently due to their quirks, my post was aimed more at T1 stuffs.
---
lol get gud adapt or die Mr. salty.
---
Keep in mind people perspective doesnt mean all that much. A lot of people would say this or that is absolutely not wort it and it doesnt meant they are right. Most of the industrial game requires dozens of millions of dedicated sp but you can do some small things to great profit and go from there.
---
I am not asking for instalocks though ;)
---
hah, nicely cutting out the fact he didn't really moonwalk out, after he bragged already about it.
---
Have you tried to bring something positive into r/eve, ever? Your negativity is annoying and it doesn't make you as cool as you think you are.
---
Exploration is pretty nice for new players imho. Generally there are many activities ou there in new eden. Best do a little bit of this a little bit of that. Don't fixate on isk making. In most countries you would maximise your isk/h if you work for minimum wage and buy plex. Thus, chose isk generating activities which you enjoy.
---
A remark towards industry, many items are under or very close to production value if you take a naive approach. Most industrialists make profit through vertical integration and stuff like that. So except for some niche production stuff industry is currently not really for very new players.
---
Elaborate plz... O.o
---
I used them to extract skills from one character and move them to another.
---
Well, I'm not entirely sure if it really was just an oopsie. I don't think that the triglavian invasion will focus on highsec alone, and i also don't think that ccp brought the drifters into play just for the sake of doing stuff. Something is going on, either they are testing the AI without restraints in null sec and adapt them according to this tests outcome and let them loose in a second wave with new behavior, or it's a lore build up for 0.0 triglavian incursions. However I really hope that some form of their implementation means more risk for 0.0. The first few days of this event, the unknown, was something I missed for a really long time
---
Bigger ships start with longer range and lower scan res.
---
Small ships start with higher scan res and lower range.
---
I'm not sure what the fuss is about, sensor boosters are a thing.  Since rejoining many have told me they are bad, but with all these small ship fleets roaming around I am finding battleships can still wreck face against those foes.  (Faction cruiser fleets on gates are hilarious to bowling ball with typhoons and macharials.)
---
Hi 'ng around I am finding battleships can still wreck face against those foes.  (Faction cruiser fleets on gates are hilarious to bowling ball with typhoons and macharials.)', im DAD.

Hi 'finding battleships can still wreck face against those foes.  (Faction cruiser fleets on gates are hilarious to bowling ball with typhoons and macharials.)'', im DAD.
---
Your posting should be prohobited.
---
I feel this. Staring at AWU V and Logi V and I can feel myself wanting to reach for the injectors.  Currently I’m a gold star omega but those trains could make me change my mind.
---
&gt; Removing Asset Safety on assets that belong to a person stuck in hospital for a random car crash is a thoroughly cuntish thing to be advocating for. 
---
You agree to world PvP when you leave the house
---
HTFU
---
Thanks. So which region would you choose?
---
Skill Injectors are used to inject skill points. Those skill points are used to train every skill in the game. 
---
What kind of question is this?
---
So which region would be your roam destination of choice?
---
Well i take any battleship above a HAC ... i'd say there is no hac that on long term can withstand a proper fitted battleship in direct 1vs1 comparison.
---
I agree in speed ofc, but from my personal view, i am usually brawling anyway, as thats what i prefer (probably not as skilled as kiting). So if something can withstand my dps over a longer period of time, i cannot see any hac, that can break whatever i was fighting in my BS.
---
I can see that taking a HAC might be preferable as to what kind of response you're looking for. If the response would be comparable of what size of ship you're flying, then you might "only" face a couple t1 cruisers, some AF's and maybe 1-2 HAC's, by whoever you're trying to fight, whilst my battleship usually gets the full blast of Macharials, logi, t3's and things like that (up to carriers, or even dreads ... but thats somehting they would probably throw on anything anyway).
---
But if we fight the same people and the response is the same, no matter if i am fighting them in my battleship or you in your HAC, i'd say, me killing something already puts me close to ISK positive and getting killed my investment is "only" around 150-200M, whilst you get nothing maybe less in kills out of it and you invested much more in terms of ISK.
---
But everything in this game is pretty much a personal choice, so if you're good in your HAC i might be totally wrong here and you get alot of kills, whilst i usually just get the beating. :)
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/group/27/losses/](https://zkillboard.com/group/27/losses/) 
---
My biggest gripe is that most of the time battleships die because they are being dropped on, either by blops or carriers/supers
---
Well, you're cheating OP. BCs aren't one step above Cruisers, they're like... fat Cruisers.
---
Compare Firgate - Cruiser - Battleship instead.
---
Most importantly you need players doing FW to indeed do FW (and not just farm LP). So any attention might help bring some life back to it as people just try it anew.
---
Most suggestions are pretty flawed. But thats imho not that muxh of an issue as the current state is broken anyways. Just pick one of the general suggestions and implement it. With most the problems would only truly occur several months to a year later until then everyone could have some fun. If a changed FW would appear broken just change it again then vOv
---
Regarding FW current problems I consider the incentive to flip the warzone due to external economic reasons to be the fundamental problem. FW is the most profitable if one faction is dominant so people are interested to push the already winning faction :(
---
SMA would crush you guys in mining yield per hour though
---
Then they should run Gurista burners like everyone else.
---
i see you missed the fact that the entire post was sarcasm - but that's ok.
---
Probably because they think im giving false info. To be fair you need a lot of isk  to sniff out the vulnerable doublers and new players probably dont have the capital for that.
---
Yes, because it is literally a weekly thing. SOTAs are not. Sorry your shitty alliance leadership does not communicate to line members very often.
---
It is NRDS. I'm a bit confused too but I think they weren't residents of Provi
---
Do they at least share origins? I always assumed that they did.
---
Thats only if you re in alliance who pushes super tight fit and at the same time you dont know how to meta down the fits. A noob would have more use of training support skills to 4 then a frigate to 5 a destro to 5 or 4 cruiser to 4 bc to 4.
---
Or just buy them because thats significanyly easier when they can just sell their own excess ded/faction loot. Its not like they NEED to source it themselves, theres always a supply.
---
Don't be salty your dumb idea didn't work out the way you planned.
---
As soemeone with a rudimentary brain at least I think you can remember names of Bots you reported and if they are still there it is easy to say that nothing has happened. Oh arent you dense?
---
&gt; 2019 guide to roaming hisec
---
I'm not even sure what I expect to see there, but I would read it.
---
I think somewhat decent idea would be to give large weapons anti-capital ammo that can only apply well to caps but gets the DPS up to 2000-2500. Tbh im just retard from WH so there is that.
---
I've said it once and i'll say it again. Making a ship tedious to fly is not the same as balancing it. Bad warp speed and lock time is not fun.
---
Wormholers use Amarr because it's more central and you're more likely to get a hole close to it, sometimes we'll use another trade hub if it's closer and we need something quick or small. 
---
I don't think anyone in the game seriously uses Rens.
---
Hard to Disagree with you, In a roaming BS, you tend to just go down swinging due to the slow creep of smaller ships, like the Jaguar and other AF's for example. 
---
Recently I did a cleanout and re-organise of my assets, sadly a lot of battleships I had lay about I threw on the wagon back to Jita/Amarr
---
This is such a dumb comment, on multiple levels.
---
1) We're not talking about fleet combat, we're talking structures.  That talking orifice / blowhole,  Mittani, has stated they can easily defend structures... if they man it with a gunner.  
---
2) The reason the Drifter BB's are so "all-powerful" is so that NPCs can compete with PCs, who can out-think them strategically and tactically every day of the week.   A blob fight between a giant "normal" NPC fleet and matching PC fleet numbers would be a short, boring fight.  
---
3) You're a potato.
---
Tbh battleships feels the most retarded ship type in game, they feel useless besides some PVE
---
You don't even know who I am.  STFU.
---
LOL, one guy literally described reporting every single character of that "farm" several times and nothing happened. Meanwhile in the last bulkban-wave CCP banned many Chars for "abuse of Alpha" that had never undocked nor even the skills to fly anything bottable and were explicitly created to hunt bots (awox chars, maybe because they endanger the subscription of bot accounts?). So with the knowledge of the "usual" way of CCP to deal with reported chars it is ridiculous to say "Well there is a function dude"reported bot
---
Running multiple characters is not exploiting.  It's extremely common, in fact.  It may even be the case that, aside from you, every character in eve is played by the same person. You can argue all day about it being "dishonorable" or "tacky" or whatever, but it is definitively not cheating.
---
Also note that multiboxing has been a thing for Eve's entire lifetime, including its largest growth periods, so it's unlikely to be the cause of its demise.
---
&gt;Special thanks to CODE for the financing of this project!
---
How did they finance this 'project'?
---
3 massive content edits in 2 minutes. You seem flustered.
---
Yeah no instaslide is pretty bogus
---
okay but post your lossmail guy
---
He bought drugs. He paid in isk.
---
if the frig pilot is coming directly towards you, he is a complete noob.
---
remember : if someone asked to orbits you at r meters range, go v meters per second, and is at d meters from you, his angular is exactly v \* r\* /d²
---
His evasion is thus 400 000 \* v \* r /sig/d², sig being the signature radius of the ship.
---
a stiletto tackling you will go r=30000m (that's the range of point T2 cold), sig=66m, v=4000, d=80000
---
so evasion = 1.136
---
five seconds later he is 60km away, so evasion is 2
---
remember that evasion is increased by falloff\_entry\*tracking/falloff if you want to factor distance and evasion together :
---
 \- deviation = evasion/tracking + falloff\_entry/faloff = (evasion+falloff\_entry\*tracking/falloff) /tracking
---
 \- hit chance h = 0.5\^deviation²
---
 \- average DPS = ( h²+h+0.05)/2
---
I can't help but feel like T1 battleships are still balanced against an ideal of what fleet fights should have been. Ships of the line trading heavy hits against one another with logi trying to keep them up, whilst swarms of smaller cruisers, destroyers and frigates jostle for position, tackling and supporting the larger ships with perhaps a handful of capital ships per side. 
---
T1 BS can still be good currently in the right circumstances, but that usage is on a knife edge, too much and you won't get a fight or get cynod on, too little and you get swamped and can't kill anything. 
---
A balance would be nice, but I suspect it's not easy given ADC's and the broad use of Pirate battleships and HACs
---
Honestly man my asklep clone deimos/ishtar/sac will eat most t1 bs apart from a neut domi idk what you are talking about. Bs are garbage. Typhoon and domi are viable the rest are utter trash. Navy Bs are trash and the only viable BS for roaming are nightmare and mach maybe bhaalgorn triple rep but im not keen.
---
+ navy raven and scorp can be okay but you are immobile as fuck and will get eaten by caps.
---
Oh wow.
---
Vega has been there a while. This is like history books shiz
---
Battleships are only really fun in small gang brawls, or Battleship 1v1s. 
---
Outside of that, travelling with them, catching things with them, and transporting them is just so cancerous.
---
Used them to inject a FAX and super alt back in early days, haven’t touched them since.
---
To sit in it and use a remote repair looks like 15 big 1 small.  Probably another 6-10 to have decent core skills though.
---
oh my god you fucking SJW shitters are coming out the wood works now that you think everyone here is in the same lock n step - enjoy your 15 minutes while you got it you insufferable pussies
---
Yea this is a great idea, even though I always forget to refuel my astra.
---
lol such salt much not adapt
---
I was in a HS group at the time, a lot of the fits being sent to me couldnt just be meta'd down because they were 10-15% over because I hadn't trained pg/CPU to 5
---
This is a pretty solid idea actually
---
Some good points bud, t1 BS need some love, and the whole BS ship tree could do with some rework tbh.
---
Clearly you never played before citadels
---
Beacause ccp needs to sell injectors.
---
His point is still valid, SMA is still shit in 2K19.
---
Vega! Those were the guys evoke hung with.
---
Soo, a dread?
---
Oh shit they are into me
---
I remember the Amar sniper BS's doing the same
---
And is there anything backing your surety?
---
Are the Drifters still roaming Null? I've heard mixed reports.
---
What are you talking about?
---
for 2.0.0 to become release-ready
---
I never said WHs are a safe place. You have to risk somethnig to earn something.  
---
but, come on, is not that risky:  
---
- small and fast ship
---
- naturaly 2 point WCS  
---
- no omega needed  
---
- can cloak (if omega)  
---
- you have to be scanned down in the gas site to be killed (so, just watch you Dscan)
---
- so cheap, it paid for himself realy quick  
---
- so cheap, some hunter don't bother to try to kill it. (I hunt venture only when there is no biger fish around, and it's a pain in ass to catch someone who knows what he does)
---
How about tree-fiddy?
---
esiJS is a node module im working on that makes it easier to get stuff from ESI. it has a function for each endpoint, and all functions are sorted by ESI group
---
What's a SOTA?
---
Not in the last 3 days, it would seem they were spooked off by the return of the "Vorlons".
---
Either way, still gonna hold them to the promise this had. Gonna plant my flag on this hill and die for it if I must.
---
Well gosh I hope the whole game doesnt voltron against us again, that would be terrible.
---
Interesting. Thank you.
---
Completely agree. Until CCP addresses those issues, it seems there is no point.
---
Or, it's 0630 and I just woke up?
---
The first one was basically calling you a fucking idiot, with no content.  I figured I owed you at least some content with my "Fuck, you're an off-topic idiot."
---
CCP dont give a shit for BS. Sry
---
&gt;Most pirate battleships are fast enough to make roaming in them not complete cancer,
---
How does a pirate bs deal with the ramjag? Only vindi?
---
I created a leadership mentoring program from my years as a Corp &amp; Alliance director/FC (and other IRL experience) and am in the process of building a business from it. The autism of EvE and community I'm in have helped me greatly through various stages of the business creation process and I couldn't have gotten to the point where I am without a lot of important members of my Alliance.
---
But you think small ships are supposed to be able to engage BSs at close range? Can a BS engage a frig at long range? No. When are you supposed to have the advantage?
---
aren't you that salty cuck in o3-
---
When I was an intern at the company I currently work at... I was able to add about half a dozen pages of very densely written instructions for how we were going to test a network used for high frequency trading. With the data in Excel and with some math I identified and showed how to avoid 3 problems that would have delayed the testing by many days while the engineers determined why those problems were happening and also presented all the test requirements in a way that made them easy to see at a high level instead of the 6 pages of requirements.
---
Just nerf medium long range guns to a reasonable point so that they don't completely outshine battleships.
---
It is designed so that the small and fast can catch your slower more powerful ship.
---
ok thanks for that info
---
one step forward in knowing when it may end at least
---
Corrected.
---
We already know how to fight people who decloak on you. It's called a super umbrella and is commonly accepted on r/Eve as fun and emergent gameplay
---
Say 14,7 and we have a deal!
---
There's no backroom deals. You simply be active for a while in the rp community and sometimes CCP-senpai notices you when doing lore stuff. There are a lot of Amarr rpers and we're loud, so we get randomly poked at a lot. There's no weird stuff going on beyond that.
---
Check out [http://evefrigates.blogspot.com/](http://evefrigates.blogspot.com/)
---
Comets are too common in FW but by far not the only thing you can fly.
---
Not sure thats gonna save your e honour im afraid
---
And being in one of the past and currently most successful groups in the game something to be sniffed at (in its current incarnation)
---
"Elitepvp" groups have done more harm to the game as a whole than any of the new player friendly empire building alliances
---
Wow a good citadel post.
---
They need a complete rework same as most things in this game, not enough money for balance devs though.
---
Is there anything to back yours?
---
There's not enough information, and it takes too many assumptions to say it's impossible.
---
If 10 people push F1 within the same second with the same latency, they will all register on the same tick.
---
So without out knowing the latency, either directly or derived based on location/isp, you don't know if it's possible or not.
---
Awesome ideas! I think some of those could really work.
---
Come to Nennamaila.  There's usually a healthy dose of evening USTZ people there.  Tama is good too.
---
CCP's dedicated balance team will be along shortly to address your concerns.
---
It would be a fourth of the DPS of an anti-cap dread, presumably in exchange for not sieging. Seems reasonable to me.
---
Blame Hilmar.
---
I'd be down for that
---
cough CSM cough
---
Some sort of scriptable module? Like a specialised sebo?
---
Easiest way to make some isk is to join a nullbloc and rat a bit. Direct isk into your account, excellent way of setting up to  buy the ships you need for other stuff.
---
This is one of the best ideas I have heard to clean up the upwell structure spam.
---
how dare you call him a shitter, you are a misogynistic prick who has trampled over people with your neo-nazi-esque 'macho' attitude but not here. We(I) shall stand up for what is right, which you sir are not.
---
Well the issue here is that it's not working that way (unless in proper fleet fights ... like Leshaks).
---
But normal T1 battleships (not talking about the raven-attacking-citadel-type) has a huge sig, is basically slower then cruisers so hitting it is pretty easy.
---
And lets say cruisers attack cruisers or battlecruisers or battleship, the incoming DPS from the same or higher type is usually comparable to the own dps and the tanking capability is pretty OK, whilst using battleships to the same or higher means going battleship vs battleship or carrier or dread ... and well DPS basically increases way faster ... whilst carrier is tankable ... a battleship vs dread ... well i could tank 2 cap-gun ones, whilst orbiting closley, but i guess a high angle gun fitted one, would wreck my battleship in seconds ...
---
So the idea is nice and all, but in reality, battleships facing bigger ships is very tricky.
---
Also I think precursor ships have harmed their viability further. Not only are they great at killing battleships, but they are a substantially more fun way to roam around with roughly equivalent dps.
---
Yeah, with a headshot,  because everything in their game is perfect and doesn't need corrections
---
Forgot:  /s
---
I have somewhat of an issue with the target of that idea : Low power structure spam isn't that much of an issue. I would much rather have something that incentive attacking any structure like an easier time attacking them
---
I'm big is building communities. I rebuilt one in CT that was dieing off. Ran that for 4 years. Then late when I moved to Toronto with the, now Ex-wife and eve player. I got in with the people running the Toronto monthly events. Then later asked to help with eve north. 
---
To me the beat part of the eve community is building new ones. I oddly enough love building corps and alliances, and meet ups. I'm alrdy saving for next year's eve north. 
---
For those that came to eve north:
---
GROUP 7 ANCHOR ON ME !!!
---
I am the Techno Viking 😉
---
Or just built into each ship, and not a module
---
Thanks for the experience! That’s what CCP needs to see.
---
muti boxing is exploiting/cheating pfff the games not for you buddy
---
I would say that caps should lose their insta-lock ability instead of giving it to BSs; but it could be improved a little.
---
The warp speed change sounds great.
---
And while they are at it, they could unfuck the cargo space on them compared to far smaller ships... in fact, make a chart a give every single ship a logical cargo bay according to their size and faction.
---
I like it.
---
LMAO
---
According to their zkill, they still are dying
---
Have you considered buying a new skin, or how about getting involved in this new highsec PVE content?
---
Hell, if that happened even small lowsec pirate groups like mine would go bash some abandoned citadels to get whatever was left inside.
---
Also big fan of more "decay" mechanics for structures.
---
I think you're on to something.  Unfortunately while BS are stuck in the past, caps have taken over the meta.
---
No I think he's talking about a paladin.
---
Snuff, we’ll snuffed out a lot of null
---
If I wasn’t already a Goon, I’d be leaving for Delve now.
---
Well you either are in the faction or not.
---
[rip me](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77565281/)
---
idk, maybe it's me but null security space with 100% security feels wrong
---
What’s incredibly ironic was back in the beginning, players asked for skill ques and CCP said “No” because they wanted players playing their game.  How weird it is to think they wound up being right.
---
For the OP, you don’t need level 5 skills to have fun, play the game.  Get in a Corp and discover how many more things you can do in a group (vice solo). Experience all areas of space, high, low, null, and (the best) wormholes :).  Try everything, never be afraid to lose a ship, treat every loss as a learning experience.  
---
Been around since 2005, there’s still no game like EvE.
---
If you have to include a falcon alt to win a fight it might not be “dominate”.
---
It was that way before it didnt work out well
---
Was a joke, i prefer command dessie alt and ceptor alt.
---
Well, Rote Kapelle is Recruiting
---
Very interested. Any volunteer talent will be welcomed.
---
As a player who has quit with the promise of never playing again and now is back. It's a stupid move
---
Soon (tm)
---
I just login, play eve online, and collect killmails.
---
"My family took turns flying that supercarrier while ratting, honestly Mr. CCP Security Team"
---
if you fly ships based on insurance payout, you may want to reconsider what the word "fun" means
---
Maybe i had to mention that in the title. He has restarted with a new char after reclycling!!!!
---
Explain to me how afk cloaking is a playstyle? You can still cloak, but forcing you to be in front of your computer is somehow wrong? Please. Don't act like no game has never fixed anything ever.
---
Cap battery eventually they will run out of cap boosters your 600 dps cruiser will eventually win because adc defanging and t2 resists exist and small sig.
---
Just dont be poor i guess is the answer. Honestly pray that CCP does another event in which they have plexs where you cant cyno sit in there with a battleship and just bait because you cant get dropped .
---
Unfortunaly sometimes that does not work.
---
Starting a new character will not solve your boredom issue. So still stupid
---
&gt; The chat isn't seperate from the rest of the game, so I don't know why you think it would have its own address.
---
The chat server absolutely does have its own address, information which you, too, can find, with a simple search function on this very forum.
---
Very interesting.

I was in one of their corps for a few weeks.  Myself and a couple of new corp mates bought all their doctrine fit crap on contract (way overpriced), showed up for a couple fights, they were so unorganized.  I was told to just stay in station and wait once and no real response was ever truly formed.  the next thing I know all of the other people on teamspeak had to go eat dinner...   I was literally the only one left in comms because it was dinner time, we were being overran, no one gave a damn.  I was eventually kicked from the corp for "being a spy".  there was no ESI investigation, just a removal and and a response of "you are a spy".  but I literally still had access to half of the channels.  I deleted and left all the discords, teamspeaks in game channels myself (because I could care less about what they were saying, not a spy).  I truly think it was all one big scam to get new people in the systems to buy the doctrine fleet crap.  Some structures were even transferred to the corp by others, and then the previous owners were kicked(for being spies).  In the end I feel this was all a ruse to get people to buy their overpriced crap and steal structures.  We all keep an eye on their systems in Querious.  The killboards and dotlans are good for a laugh from time to time.  Saw the goons came in and did some babysitting recently because SMA was so inept.  I think most of us are glad we were kicked, it looks like a giant cluster F#(% down there.

So, you're a talentless dick who just likes to bash other people to make himself feel better about being a talentless dick. Gotcha thanks bye.
---
Any improvement is, well, improvement.
---
But c'monnnnnn. How hard is it to have a master account and let everything use the same TOTP seed when linked by verified email? Random seeds beat weak human-entered seeds.
---
Also, how hard is it to give a couple of weeks free omega gametime when someone activates MFA (once per email)?
---
I'm not exactly oblivious to the challenges, I've implemented TOTP on multiple commercial systems. I know it's not a *snap fingers* and it's done, but it's well worth the week it would take.
---
&gt;enjoy your 15 minutes while you got it you insufferable pussies
---
and yet you keep showing up trying to get yours. if you weren't such an insufferable jackhole, it might happen. but nope.
---
Thanks, I appreciate the advice. I see this as more of a 'fact finding' post than anything else. I stumbled on the idea of making and selling ammunition last night in game, and think that moght a be a decent way to make some in game cash.
---
I also appreciate the tips regarding industry. I may consider going Omega eventually to flesh that out, but as an Alpha there seem to be a lot of combat based options.
---
You should read description buddy. I stated I lost the armaggedon minute after. But I did moonwalk out after killing the loki
---
Yeah, the Triglavian ships are cool, but to be honest I was really surprised they introduced a whole new ship race before fixing what is wrong with the old ones (and then continued to add T2 variants)
---
Sup AK! Good fights last night btw. :)
---
Also if they're bringing a giant coalition blob, don't forget to rage ping for interdictors and waterboard the everloving shit out of their fleet. Make that op as annoying as possible for their fcs and their pilots, so next time they bring something appropriately agile!
---
What is a "hardcore player"? How do they differ from regular players?  
---
What if I told you that "hardcore players" are much, much worse for the state of nullsec than mega-coalitions? Not quite as bad as NPC raids that threaten Sov, but still quite bad.
---
&gt;assets that belong to a person stuck in hospital
---
so what was he doing before asset safety? it's a new-ish mechanic that no one had before. stop whining. space is fucking dangerous. if you are worried about losing stuff don't move to null. stay in hisec with all the other risk averse pubbies.
---
Meh more like it.
---
worst mechanic ever.
---
The problem is that BS are essentially just shitty caps. They don't track anything that matters and the things they do track are either other Battleships (which they are admittedly balanced against) or caps.
---
The other side of that balance though is that a Frigate can't sustain very many hits from a battleship to begin with. 
---
The solution then I think is to add utility rather than change base stats. If the problem is Frigates doing circles constantly scamming and being impossible to hit, why not add smartbomb scrams and webs? They could need to charge up like MJDs, and maybe have a 10s active time, and then maintain their effects for another 10s after? Would give BBs just enough time to lock a target and return fire, and defend themselves at least a little.
---
pod pilots are immortal yet this guy finds the gameover screen anyway.
---
Biology and physics.
---
It's possible once or twice by luck, but that's why I said it's impossible to pull this off consistently. If you press F1 within one second in the middle of a tick, you're still going to have half your fleet register on a different server tick.
---
It actually takes a lot of assumptions to say it's possible - same latency and no input lag, no lag relaying commands, instant reaction to those commands, no difference in execute time. All of that at the same time is not possible even if you're sitting in the same room.
---
So, I stumbled upon this yesterday while it was happening and when I saw "Chemosh" on grid I kinda flipped my lid. I did see some RP chat in local with one dude going "SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT THE HELL UP" and was confused, as I DIDNT EVEN KNOW there was an RP element to this game.  
---
I seem to be realizing the TRUE meaning of "sandbox" just now, even though I've played this game for many years.  
---
The fact that the Devs are involved in the RP really makes me that much more proud of this game and it's team despite the "REEEEEEEEE EVE IS DEAAAAAD" posts all over the place from old bittervets
---
Most idiot things, like "I'm so smart I know what CCP is/isn't doing" are easy to say. It's just adorable watching you say them. You should keep saying these idiot things.
---
It's a playstyle you might not enjoy, or think is sporting or fair, but it's still a playstyle - just like ganking, scamming, etc.  Olmeca Gold, the newest CSM, does nothing but cloaky camp Delve and steal excavators.  He got elected to the CSM by making a cool video of it.  It's a playstyle.
---
Your playstyle is not better than anyone else's.  Try to remember that.
---
When I was still able to play EvE, I watched ppl do this endlessly in Providence.  It's effective, and takes the defending Alliance either occupying their border/ dead systems or keeping a closer watch for drive by sov wanding.
---
Sounds like fun for you sir, good luck.
---
This reminds me of a game I used to play
---
I feel personally attacked!
---
do you have any EBRs?
---
Nah. I’m not even sure if they have ever worked together or even had a formal conversation.
---
Use Linux you normie! ree!
---
If blinging out stuff would always be the key to win, then i would agree ... but for most of the fights i had and the losses that came with them, i very often asked myself if another ship, super blinged with implants, would have made a difference ... and even if it's only theory and proving it is hard, i came almost always to the conclusion that it would have made no difference.
---
Couple days ago, i had tried to go with battleships into null ... 3 times. First time i died to Loki, Confessor, Slicer, Loki, Kiki, SAC, Brutix, Navy Maulus, Jackdaw and a couple ceptors and a dictor. 2nd round, i died to Arazu, Caracal, Thanatos, Hel, Hel. and 3rd Time i died to Dominix, Gonis, Armageddon, Panther and a Loggerhead ... have to mention i didn't even make it into null. Everytime i complete different route. Would i have survived in any HAC? Would i have been able to kill something? Trying to be super objective ... i'd say no ...

"GIVE ME ALL YOUR SPOD AND THE MONKEY GETS.... er... I mean... DOESN'T\* GET HURT
---
Yes please. Bring back instaslide, kill the PVE focus on isk making and make it all about roaming, plexing, fighting, anything that gets fights. Fuck neutral citadels in facwar lowsec, if you're in a militia opposed to the sov holder you can't dock in anything. So fuck neutral citadels unless they're in your space.
---
Novice plex rebalance. Big one. Fucking...this is a massive mess right now and it's no fun. Honestly we may need more classes of plexes.
---
Include a cyno inhibitor in the ihub upgrades. While we do love ourselves some militia super brawls, let the defender decide.
---
Make bigger ships capture bigger shit faster. Encourage people to risk battleships for more isk/hr and plex/hr. Maybe it's a stretch to say battleship fleets will become a thing, but solo battleships could, and machariels are already very dangerous. That's a lot of isk on the line, so it's good.
---
I don't care if you cloak camp buddy. Just.dont walk away for 8 hrs while you go to your Taco Bell job. Get it?
---
Same, decay mechanics would be absolutely great. CCP made a step in the right direction with the low power state, then immediately took two steps back and shot themselves in the foot for good measure by reworking citadel timers to be even more cancerous at the same time.
---
Well youd have been faster harder to catch youd have found it easier to kill tackle and supers wouldnt have applied so yeah probably. 
---
What BS are you running?? 
---
I have consistently roamed solo or with 2 in a nightmare crystals in and ive killed blops fleets small gangs you name it sounds like you aren’t good at picking engagements i dont count getting hotdropped because fast tackle exists.
---
If you say hyperion, maelstrom or raven i will understand why youre having a trash time.
---
You work at ccp don't you. What's your employee ID so I can put you in for accommodation? Lol

Im using Dominix, its really good for solo lvl 4 sec missions. Using it with micro jump drive, so im mostly sniping from 50-80 km with sentry drones (about 60% of dps) and 3x 425mm and 1x 350mm railgun. Frigates coming on you are really easy to hit even with that big turrets, if they manage to come closer than 20 km, just change drones from sentry to Warriors. What I want to say is, that you need drones. IDK how it works in PVP, so I will be glad for some fitting tips on PVP Dominix :)

This is pretty spot on. The fact of the matter is hacs out class battleships in every way and isk inflation ha made them a viable mainline ship. Battleships are a Relic that currently serve no purpose. If you want them to be useful they need to out class hacs in damage and tank at least...

Oh oh here!! Let me try: he splits weapons and pushes f1-5 to get on all killmails?

you guys are worse at killing content by dropping caps then NCPL ever were. only roam there if you like getting caps dropped on you as soon as you win
---
Yes
---
The reason why I recycled my 80 mil sp character is because I injected him en bought everything I had , everything I build , my sp , all my assets I had , it was paid with real life money and after a while of playing I started to have a feeling I was not playing this awesome game how I should to play it and had no satisfaction or awareness of my assets value whatsoever . So this way I saw no other way to release me from this curse but to delete everything I had , bought with real life money and start all over again , just to get the right feeling playing this game , grind and work myself up again from scratch
---
The correct answer is that there should be less capitals. I think capitals should be exclusive to PVP and not be viable at all for PVE. There are too many capitals in the game and it's just ruining everything. The price of capitals is hilarious, I can rat in a Nidhoggur with 2800 DPS and after insurance it would cost 800 mill to lose, that is a complete joke. Super ratting and rorqual mining should not be a thing either. Rorquals should be boosters and an ore hold only.  
---
I would also like to see resource depletion in regions so that players have an incentive not to join large alliances.
---
out of so many choices for an alt to suppport a bs solo/small gang, you choose a falcon. Fascinating.
---
I can see a cruiser or T3 MAYBE not eating shit to a BS with only one heavy neut, once you get to two all cruisers with active tanks will get dumpstered.  Seeing as how Domi, Geddon, and Tempest are damn near the only "good" T1 battleships cruisers should almost never be a problem for you.
---

I agree with you 100%. Battleships just don't seem fun at all.

I would like those 12 seconds back plz.

aaaaaaand there it is
---
Another option is to offer to leave the victim alliance alone after they presumably are tired of your trolling - for a fee of course.
---
Best option is to avoid the bubble entirely by wrapping to perches or at least celestials. Barring that, if you do get caught it’s situational how you respond. Basically align to a celestially and try and burn out or fight if you can.
---
I did that with &gt; 100m characters, mostly because they were kind-of kitchen-sink and unfocused.  I took the hit and injected some new, focused characters.

I like everything to be neat and tidy you see.

So to be clear , I’m not bored and I’m not quitting eve , I’m just starting playing this game , it’s almost a shame such things are possible in a game like this and I was ashamed of myself using it so I think this was the best solution for me
---
Fully support this :)
---
yeah same here, I don't even bother to fly anything past bc because the efficiency is thrown out of window and it's just too expensive to justify it.
---
I did a safe dock and then logged back in to see if it’d work but sadly it didn’t. I contacted ccp and they forced my ship to dock. Unfortunately I had to go to bed so I haven’t logged in since. I will be as soon as I get home from work.
---
I know it's hard to tell from my name, but I am not a cloaky null camper.  but if I was, and I walked away, what's wrong with that?  What's wrong with a Rorq pilot stepping away for an hour or two while he chews on rocks?   
---
I understand you don't like cloaky camping.  That's fine, you're entitled to that opinion.  But that opinion does not make your preferred playstyle more or less valid than anyone else's.  There are counters to camping. Camping itself is a counter to intel networks and instant intel from local. You are obviously struggling with those things.  Luckily, I'm here to help.

---
I find Jita local chat irritating/distracting.  You know what my solution is? I minimize that window when I am in Jita.  I suggest you do the same.
---
so you can kill a ship if they're doing literally everything possibly wrong?
---
Well it depends on my mood.
---
I usually run Typhoon, Armageddon, Tempest or Raven or Megathron (very rarely Rokh, Dominix). I have to admit i cannot use large laser weapons :D So all other amarr ships are basically a no go for me ^^.
---
Typhoon is T2 Torp fit, Armageddon T2 Rapid Heavy, Tempest T2 800mm AC's. Raven T2 Rapid heavy, Mega T2 Electron Blaster Cannon. When shield fit, usually Dual XLASB, when armor it's full tank, RAH and T2 Large Armor Rep + Large Anci Armor Rep. Cap Inject 3200.
---
As i said, i try to keep it low-cost, due to the mass amount of ships i usually throw against the wall. :)
---
Well i know about the nightmare fit, but it's too predicatble in terms of what it can do ... so i always wonder why ppl don't bring web-ships from the start. I know that alot of ppl would suggest the Hyperion for T1 battleship ... but there is a simple reason why i don't take it ... everyone knows from the start how it's fitted and how it's beeing used ... i prefer ships that could be also buffer fitted ships, or rolling ships, that appear like defenseless victim-ships :D
---
\*Cries in Scorpion Navy Issue\*
---
So youre saying we should all blue each other since its the most optimal?
---
Happens everytime goons go away. Someone comes over and beats the piss out of the QFC. Tho always seems to be Wallymart leading the beat down. Good for him. I always enjoyed working with and vs him. 
---
Darwin was also fun to fight tho our main tzs never seemed to match up. Darwin is more EU it always seemed from outside looking in. 
---
I've been watching the fight between SMA and NSH. Always looked like they were on their own and never got meaningful support from the other QFC alliances.  Then trying to fight Wallymarts loki with canes and Caracals. No one is surprised it turned out like this. I will give SMA credit. They never seemed to just roll over and die. They always seemed to be trying even if it was in vain. Tho that goons are home tho. I'm sure they will clean up NSH rather quickly. NSH alrdy lost a nice Mach fleet even when NC brought Eagles to help on a fort timer.
---
What a new and innovative idea, good job ccp and eve north
---
I know this isn't T1, but can someone explain to me why Black Ops get a "no sensor re calibration" bonus to negate the downside of cloaking devices, but then still have to suffer through the scan resolution penalty of cloaking devices?
---
It’s on Sutonia’s YouTube channel
---
Thats an interesting reason. Before i started with EVE ppl told me about "wrong skilling" ... that you have to restart, once you skilled something wrong.
---
But it turns out there is no wrong skilling ... just a bit time that was spend into a skill you might not need or use. And lets put SkillInjectors to the side, there is basically no way to archive skills faster with a new toon, then with one that has already &gt;100M SP. You still skill the same way, only difference your &gt;100M SP already has tons of other skills.
---
its not really a stupid move since CCP will un-biomass your character if you petition them.
---
it's just pointless.
---
A lots of "hopefully" before "PVP" in that text, but it is a form of content different than just ping-warrioring amidst countless hours of grinding NPCs, so have my upvote.

---
Bye Felicia.
---
I'm down with an AU increase to warp, even if slight
---
the lock time argument here is weak. Battleships can't track frigates..... if there are 8 of them, with webs, all descending on you at the same time
---
but battleships have neuts (sometimes more than one!), grapple, and ample drone bays giving them many tools to deal with the one-off frigate. the point of the lock time is to prevent battleships from oppressing lone tackle frigates as a larger, more right-sized response force gets in position (hmm... why would this bother the Tuskers???)
---
Battleships need buffs, lock time is not one of them
---
At least extract the whole thing and put all the injectors on an alt.  Regardless of inflation they'll hold great value if you ever want to come back, though you could never just re-inject them all for the same amount of sp, and your original char is "dead"
---
Well common sense and independant thinking seem unknown to you.
---
Don't skip playing the game. Fly cheap shit that won't hurt to lose until you have the skills to comfortable and effectively fly something more expensive.
---
there's a lot to be said about the weird decision to declare war on snuff, but them inevitably losing isn't any sign of lack of skill.
---
I have already had mine and continue to do so, enjoy my shadow nerd
---
I'd disagree. The Battleship is just not meant for 1v1 battles or general stuff -- it's basically the gateway to Capitals. It ticks every "capital" box: It's slow, aligns slow, targets slow, tracks slow, hits hard, has big tank. That's the point.
---
Very stupid
---
There's a technical limitation which is currently blocking them. :(

Good Lord.....

I didn’t want to say ‘definitely’ because that would be a lie but my alliance has been sov trolling and generating content for the past 18 months in Dronelands and we are still getting PvP and enjoying it :)

Good luck farming for Barghest LP in Pure Blind. I've been trying it for the past few days. The Russian and French dingbats that live there won't leave you alone even if you ask nicely and will chase you around. Doesn't matter if you're flying cheapo catalysts either, they still hunt you down. Makes it feel broken to put the only Morduu's Legion mission hub in a null pocket, and now that pocket is surrounded by two alliances that won't let anyone near it. Feelsbadman.jpg
---
Go to an Eve Meetup!
---
But instead on the last bulkban-wave they banned numerous unreported Alpha-Accounts with the text "Alpha Account abuse" that never have undocked in their live nor could fly anything bottable. These Chars were created and brought into Alliances known to harbor bots foe awoxing purposes. 
---
So my conclusion on this is, that it is an abuse to use anAlpha to awox Alphas botting VNIs or Subs botting bigger stuff. My experiences on the last ban wave leave no other option...
---
yw, alpha have reduced industry because bots would abuse it but as a low sp char you could consider moving materials (they take less m3) to a pvp or pve hub far from jita then build what is needed and sell there at decent markup, most players will happily pay twice jita price on consumables if it saves them the 20 jumps. Also scripts, implants and drones mobile depots, mtu's and fuel are high in demand, gl.
---
- Trash the tier system
---
- Make it so that a militia can't dock/tether in citadels in a system they don't own
---
- Make it so that you can only run missions in systems own by the enemy^1
---
- If possible trash the whole FW mission thing and add PvE anomalies in enemy systems you have to run that give you isk and LP (only if you are militia of course).
---
(^1 I am not an FW mission runner but this seems like a pretty good nerf to mission running)
---
  🚜
---
Dang, I was so excited about being able to drop some knowledge. You beat me to it.
---
I will say that in all fairness t1 BS were designed in a (eve) world to be superior to t1 BC and down.
---
Which they generally still are. So we should really ad whatever the HAC version of a BS would be imo. Also all of the BS buffs sound reasonable, especially with the BS shit align time. Hell bump warp to 3au, and I think that would be the only thing in eve that literally everyone would be happy about.
---
Big issue here is power balance...  In reality, big ships pack big tech...  but in EVE, big ship are just big... big guns, all slow...  Titans are huge, but when you look at their weapon arrays, is just like any other ship in EVE...  But imagine a ship that is several KILOMETERS long with some weapons, and all that wasted ship infrastructure...  Well, it seems that it works well in EVE... it has been tuned over the years...  BS have lots of slots to balance slow locking times...  Scanners help a lot... and help deal damage...  In my view, is the position that has worked best for EVE...  
---
I would like to see something different, but in EVE balance is everything...
---
so basically adding a "No power mode"
---
this is what should have happend when they introduced low power mode, in low power mode the citadel should run of some power reserves that run out if not refueled in time and should take time to recharge when it gets fueled again so just fueling for one day each month won't work
---
Always drove me nuts
---
So many people with the strangest logic in this thread. The only reason to re-roll your character is if you don't like the name. If /u/Ooooooofooooooooff  wanted to 'tidy up', he could have just extracted the skills he didn't think made sense and sold them at a slight loss.
---
No, I just made a new account :-)

As someone who's used a \*lot\* of bookmarks for both PvE and PvP this comes from experience.  This includes several months in WH (before Citadels when it was actually hard), FW and PvP in lowsec and null...
---
 **Question 1 - Bookmark Vouchers**
---
Ideally your ACL can also set 'cannot copy bookmarks' so you can actually have tactical bookmarks people can't steal when they leave your corp/alliance.
---
Also giving people the ability to only view folders (i.e. not add), as well as separate ACL for add and remove.
---
Most of the reason to trade bookmarks disappear with ACLs (you could even give temp ACL to a folder for selling PvE locations).  Plus the jetcan bookmark thing is ridiculous (but great for spamming jetcans on gates...)
---
**Question 2 - Bookmark Expiry Lengths**
---
1 day (wh etc)
---
2 days (escalations etc.)
---
2 weeks (tactical bookmarks for short term targets)
---
Zero point having 2 hr expiration as just use 1 day...
---
**Question 3 - Setting Bookmark Expiry**
---
Bookmark expiry should be by folder.  So you could easily have a Wormholes folder (set to 1 day) and a temp tactical (set to 2 weeks) and a gate pings (set to never).
---
&gt; Part of the trolling is the fact you managed to waste the time of several hundred F1 monkeys who would rather be krabbing. 
---
This is kind of where your logic falls apart.
---
The people in the blobs you are talking about have krabbing (or combat) alts. They'll have the krabbing toons out there raking in the isk while their combat alts sit in a staging citadel waiting until something happens.
---
All you've really accomplished is having their combat standing fleet move from their usual staging to whatever keepstar is in range of the constellation you are attacking.
---
There's a reason why "made you form!" is a meme...

ok
---
Yeah my post was aimed at PvP, I don´t really do much PvE ;)
---
If you think about it BS type ships have pretty much always been used (IRL &amp; Eve) to either pound heavy objectives or defend them. Small group/solo BS are only good for bait, station/gate/anom games. With an MJD it literally forces someone to get in scram/neut range (unless garmur)

How to keep passwords secure, 101: DON'T FUCKING SHARE THEM WITH ANYBODY!
---
Why a password manager would introduce a feature to encourage people to do that is beyond me.
---
Unless a game's anticheat actively monitors other running software on a client's machine, that's how it detect bots and multiboxers - by searching for something that isn't realistically possible to do for humans. This is one of those cases.
---
I am not a fan of instalocking battleships, but as I said their lock times need to be buffed.  
---
Instalocking caps with infinite points and webs are retarded and whoever introduced that into the game should be fired.
---
Hasn't that just been the CCP method for years now? Build on top of the old and ignore it, hoping that the problem goes away?
---
that place is hell, i tried doing plexes in my venture and some mean person killed me :(
---
Probably the worst advice ever
---
The issue is the skin ownership "changes" per gunner because when you take control of a citadel the mechanics are essentially those of being in a ship so i dont know if something like that would work due to the general design of citadel mechanics for fittings
---
Something like that might be viable but at that point youre now overhauling the skins mechanic from being a permanently active possession into a module item, id imagine it would break everything else to do with skins
---
 Making Networked Sensor Array a shitty version of a siege mod because carriers are too powerful but shitty version of siege module doesnt make carrier stronger or weaker just less mobile.  So what this really about is making easier to catch for your small gang.

---
Why be a part of that?
---
Agreed.
---
You’d be surprised. ;)
---
Can only agree.
---
Power creep...
---
When we're talking about balance, all sides are reasonable to consider, or you should at least be aware of them.
---
Really dumb anyway, people play differently from you. Your fun isn't someone else's fun. Some people enjoy flying a ship that costs 50m after insurance and they can welp it all day
---
If I had a nickel for every paragraph that started with "So"
---
I really dislike people encouraging storage of 2FA secrets/recovery codes/etc. inside their password management application.
---
If you're using a unique, randomly generated password then you're not gaining any additional security if you store your 2FA secret into a password manager. Anyone who compromises your password database will also compromise the 2FA. Your 2FA should be on your phone or a physical hardware authenticator such as a Yubikey.
---
River logged off and doesn't care what happens to his alliance again? I'm shocked, shocked I tell you.
---
Not when you have nothing to produce said good with.
---
Any chance you could explain the limitation? As someone who's implemented U2F in an application I'm just curious what roadblock CCP is running into.
---
The fact that a properly fit T1 BS can one shot frigates and super tank small frigate fleets does not mean it needs to insta lock as well. There are mods for that.
---
Nice work! Doesn't look like you do authenticated routes yet, but looks easier to use than the reference swagger client. I like it.
---
Y'all *really* underestimate the number of empire space industrialists. 
---
They don't need rorquals when they're not building supers by the dozens.
---
The embedded browser they're using in the launcher doesn't currently support it.
---
&gt; Weaponized Autism
---
No that in EVE is called "Rorqual Mining"
---
Larger ships with more mass take longer to maneuver? News at 11.
---
Also, if only there were Sensor Boosters to improve locking time. OH wait...
---
It's called an Icelander's attempt at balance. While not perfect there must be give and take based on the ship class chosen. 
---
It only takes a few seconds for a frig to lock a BS but it's like shooting airsoft pellets at an M1 Abrams. pew. pew pew.. pew. pew pew pew...... 3 min later.. pew. pew pew..pew.....
---
It may take that Rokh 22 sec to lock, but damn, if you are blaster fit and have webs.. YEET! Peace sucka! \*blue flash\*....
---
Sounds exactly what people do to QFC especially when Daddy Bee was deployed ....
---
OOK OOK
---
for best salt hit russians/tapi pets. Their in game death threats are very motivational and uplifting!
---
1Password never see your passwords. Encrypted on the client, with a key which never leaves your devices/head
---
Dualweb Nightmare will probably eat it due to being fast under scram and having 2 neuts. 
---
Bhaal has long webs and scary neuts which means Jag will not get into scram range.
---
Barghest will scram it at 30+km and laugh as the Jag very very very slowly dies.
---
Not sure about Rattlesnake Gecko but I assume it can put quite the dent into a tackled Jag, but you fly the Rattle with the notion of getting tackled anyway.
---
Mach is a prime ramming target and I think I saw a Nestor 3 weeks ago in a WH, do people even use them anymore?
---
Ah that makes sense.
---
is that why titans are being exported each day?
---
Serious question: Why do you think abandoned citadels are an issue?
---
Yeah remember all those outposts we blew up and looted?
---
Hi! I exist.  
---
Real life has been, uh-- let's just say major life changes have occurred.  
---
Will resolve this.
---
It's one of those  "security isn't as good as if you do it 'properly', but it's still better than not doing it" things. 
---
(tbh, if someone compromised my password database, I'm fucked anyway)
---
F for someone who was honestly one of the most active players in the area.
---
&gt; so what was he doing before asset safety? it's a new-ish mechanic that no one had before
---
Probably keeping his assets in an outpost which could not be blown up period?
---
"What's the netflix password?"
---
"If I die (or fall into a coma), who can get at my passwords?"
---
Oh I totally get that, but I just don't see the point of enabling 2FA at all if you're going to put the secret into your password database. It's just extra inconvenience of copying a code for zero additional security.
---
Not only no, but fuck no. This is eve, risk is part of the game (or was). You consent to this risk when you store your shit somewhere.
---
Basing the rules around some wierd fringe chances that the player is indisposed ruins the risk/reward meta for everyone.
---
wormholes are pretty unreliable for targeting a specific group (in this case the smaller allies who have to call for coalition backup) because you have no control where they end up. Which is fine if you just want some rorqual killmails from anything not blue, but your gonna have to rageroll a NS static to target a specific region which can be a PITA.
---
nope
---
I like how everyone claims I want BS to instalock frigates, while I proposed a pretty reasonable locking speed.
---
inb4 tdsin showing up to every fight in eve.

Stupid, really fucking stupid, no respect deserved.
---
He achieved absolutely nothing by nuking his character over just mothballing it, and there is a 90% chance he'll deeply regret it in some time.
---
Been using domis the last two days, my fit comes out to roughly 250m each, so 500m total which is still less than the rattle not to mention the insurance on domis is pretty good. Roughly 9 minute sites which I'm very happy with. thanks
---
Hey null bloc Koolaid chugger #215654, that's what your leaders would have you believe, doesn't make it actual good advice to anyone.
---
* You can go where the hell you want
---
* You can lean the game at your own pace
---
* You can have fun outside a blob
---
The ops only error is they didn't learn from their mistakes, and they let their mistakes be of consiquence to them.
---
You are assuming a scenario where the frig is solo vs a BS, which happens exactly never.
---
Also, larger ships would have more powerful propulsion mods, news at 12. BCs use 50MN while BS use 500MN. Thats 10 times more. speed.
---
Also, if the frig is ab no amount of webs will help you, unless you fit medium guns which is a gimmicky solution at best.
---
Sounds almost like proposing a change on Reddit
---
Arenas ?

Your average linemember just farms on their main.

if we want to target a specific region, we place our balls full of 1000 titans on their face.
---
 he has an argument (you can see in this post), but i also think he will regret it
---
and then both sides dont have fun
---
Because a tanked freighter is not very economically viable to gank and has a good chance of getting away even if you gank them.
---
If CCP leaks credentials combinations without leaking OTP code (QR alternative, can't recall what its proper name is), then 2FA can actually save your ass. All in all, it's always better to have 2FA turned on than off
---
guess you were on the other side, cos i had plenty of fun - and i don't even own a titan.
---
Yeah your idea is good tbh ;=) And no power mode is 0 timer.
---
the shadow of your narcissistic arrogance and utter buffoonery? sure. let's do that
---
It's like CCP is staffed by people who are sci-fi nerds and super into EVE. The nerve of them!
---
i was with you, it was pretty boring ngl, what did you find fun?
---
Get. Fucked.
---
i heard sort dragon pays rather good
---
No adequate password management company will ever have access to your unencrypted passwords. Seems like you don't really understand how it works behind the scenes
---
State Of The Alliance, basically a thing that an alliance's leadership will typically do occasionally when there's major events to discuss.  OP is riffing off that by doing one for the drifter NPCs.
---
most definitely.
---
you are fake newbs.
---
Good stuff there my dude. Certainly worth trying out!
---
Well, at least you’re setting reasonable goals. It might even work, if everyone else in New Eden is incapable of adapting... which, Y’know, that’s possible.
---
25 people I met in Eve all came to a city near me from all over the world to meet up, have fun and get drunk.  
---
Amazing.
---
For the code savvy explanation:
---
Items exist in the assets table. 
---
This is:
---
|Asset ID|Owner|Location|type|quantity|flag|
---
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
---
(There's a little more, but they're not relevant for this)
---
Location is a ship, a structure, a character (skills exist as assets in your head.) or a container.
---
Owner is a character or corporation.
---
What you won't see, is a separate location id for a corporation hangar. Those are just flags on assets. 
---
So if you have 9001 tritanium in corp hangar 1, and 69 mexalon in hangar 2 in Jita 4-4 CNAP, you'd have
---
|assetid goes here|Your corporation ID|the Jita 4-4 CNAP's station ID|tritanium |9001|hangar 1|
---
|different assetid goes here|Your corporation ID|the Jita 4-4 CNAP's station ID|tritanium |9001|hangar 2|
---
Those flags are a limited list. There's around 100 iirc, covering things like ship hangars, corpse bays, pi bays and so on. 
---
Access to all of this is through the corp management system.
---
To put this into ACLs means either updating \_all\_ the code to interact with assets, or having the ACL hangar not interact with anything and doing it seperately. (so if you want to manufacture with it, you'd have to drag stuff to your own hangar.) And that option is just nasty.
---
Still at a loss where this misconception that goons are butthurt is coming from...
---
Quality post either way.
---
From my time in horde, you cannot sell those, after asking friends in other alliances thru discord, they only buy escalations from anoms not scanned. Tbh, get a t3c and run them yourself, make sure you drop a depot or something and have a refit available
---
Please no. I prefer if CCP concentrates on getting more subscribers instead of making the existing subscribers pay more.
---
&gt;When we're talking about sarcasm, all sides are reasonable to consider, or you should at least be aware of them.  
---
&gt;Really dumb anyway, people think differently from you. Your sarcasm isn't someone else's sarcasm. Some people enjoy shitposting that costs 50 karma after insurance and they can welp it all day
---
I usually get a few fights in Nenn but if I bring a gang GMVA just shits itself and docks up
---
same thing i find fun in every war.
---
shooting things.
---
&gt;Retarded problems require retarded solutions.
---
I'm not sure i can get behind that line of reasoning.
---
Just delete attributes.
---
implying ccp is actually interested in balancing this shitshow
---
CCP is not good at symmetry in their ship design.
---
underrated comment there
---
I wouldn't be a huge fan of this personally, I prefer it to the general mass skill injection and paying for sp straight up. It could be a thing, I'd like it in the form of a drug perhaps, much like the absolute booster from last year. Have it add however many remaps, and you can only take this drug so many times a year.
---
Amending attributes doesn't help too much for training skills between level 1 and 4, but for lvl 5 skills, the really long trains like titan V and JF V it'll take days off of this. This would be abused, put a hard limit as I described. Or just increase the limit already present.
---
Tldr, maybe implement this feature as a drug much like how the absolute booster was implemented.
---
I think you’d be surprised at what people think is input broadcasting.
---
I have no doubt this is input broadcasting lol, but with things like eve-o hotkey switcher, it can be possible to do things like run 6-7 accounts to do burner missions, but people think that requires input broadcasting.
---
This would be better.
---
Nice :-)
---
No worries! Hope everything's ok (real life is always priority #1). Thanks for responding!
---
Battleships in general need a bit of love.
---
While I somewhat agree with your warp speed change, you should look at this from multiple scales of perspective. I do think that warp speed should be brought up, but not so much that it will compete with battlecruisers and force them out of their role.
---
For the ferox vs rokh specifically, their primary applications are at &lt;120km for the Ferox and 100km-300km for the Rokh,  not to say the Rokh can't fight within 100km but it shines the most at sniping where opponents can't shoot back. The Naga fits into a similar niche but with less tank/dps. Increasing the Rokh's warp speed too much would render Nagas moot and start encroaching a little on what makes Feroxes so useful, at least until boosh dessies are brought into line.
---
The same can go for scan resolution - while I don't think it should be 20+ seconds maybe 13-15 would be more appropriate, that way after fleet boosts they're still reasonable. That means you have to provide your battleships something like support harpies for anti-tackle. Keeps ceptors in their role since they can still close enough distance to be hard to track from 70-100km away but now the battleships can send their drones out to deal with that threat.
---
Give 'em a smaller version of the Networked Sensor Array, with a smaller set of penalties. That increases fitting options without totaly disturbing the current uses, allowing people to fit for a specific role.
---
I don't think you are realizing how much easier it would be to fit a BS to insta lock frigates.
---
I never noticed that and now I can’t unsee it.
---
Killboards reveal everything about a player from fits they fly, playstyle, timezone, friends, alts, tactics bait, where they engage and so on...
---
Also killboards are a major factor when joining any PvP minded corp, it gets looked over and hazed if some things (like padding) sticks out and might be the deciding factor in you joining that group or not.
---
So to summarize they mean quite a lot, saying otherwise just shows your inexperience as a EVE player.
---
fuck off until we get extractor locks
---
I was thinking why CCP had to do the drifter invasion, and thought of this as one of main reasons. Besides that, I've read numerous complaints on this subreddit about citadel spam cleanup being tedious + made my own assumption that many of them are not actively used, which was further reinforced by anecdotal evidence of seeing numerous low power citadels while roaming null. 
---
For me citadel spam by itself is not an issue. But if one of solutions to it could provide more content for my playstyle, I am all for it.
---
Yeah. Such a better attitude than "CCP is messing with our ability to level up our wallets and buy more supers!"
---
We've been trying to figure that out since before WWB.
---
I hear it’s nice in Nennamaila this time of year.
---
This guy plays Eve.
---
i love the blue donut on the left
---
at the very minimum, normalise them.
---
Nerd.
---
Imagine everyone's surprise when it is revealed that Bob is really just an employee at CCP.
---
Went to the EvE NT Finals in Nottingham just after participating myself.
---
Stroke of luck, the fellow who said he'd meet me there ended up being *incredibly late* forcing me to mingle with a group that I did not know. Although we have not stayed in touch in game, or otherwise, it was nice to chill out with people I didn't know for a change and get on well with.
---
Friends later showed up but I ended up flitting between both groups. And activities included blowing up an Avocado inflatable.
---
Well you know it's right here right now. We take alphas also so like it's free :)
---
Shit you can tank a TC3 almost as strong as a BS with very close to the same DPS (BS depending of course). 
---
I don't fly anything bigger than a cruiser these days. I don't see much point in any bigger sub caps.
---
Ah yes, ok Mach I can get behind.
---
I can't complain. NSH is definitely worth shooting, especially when they bring Machs.
---
Got. Milk.
---
I've honestly never had that problem with GMVA.  They have some pretty good dudes in their alliance and usually always give us GF's.   We had a very fun fight with them yesterday.
---
Is it weird that my favorite part of this was dunk saying cheers fuck the British?
---
Kitsunes are a lot of fun to fly though.
---
Also Adversity, literally did the exact thing featured in this video multiple times except with 1 guy dual boxing em lol.
---
It's as if they forgot they have a test server.
---
Except it doesnt do anything related to capital ships.
---
Someone else should have his stuff
---
Be careful of dancul will strike you down for this violent act.
---
Since you are so quick to reply without thinking about what I was talking about, let me explain. I was merely commenting on the asset safety portion of OP that before citadels you still ran the risk of losing your things, maybe not to someone else persay, but losing access to the outpost and everything inside.
---
What do capital ships "do" that is so different?
---
To be clear: Capital ships are useless for 90% of EVE gameplay. This is coming from someone who has 4 of them sitting in my hangar at any given time.
---
Spoken like someone who has literally never flown a BS outside of f1 blob trash fleets.  Good job.  "But BS applies so well to frigs if you have 3 web lokis and a TP Golem!"
---
So what your saying is that CCP probably has the tools to determine if this dude is input broadcasting, but we, as players, do not.
---
Which, coincidentally, is the same thing I'm saying.
---
Ushy, I still have one up and running, going to update it to 1.14.3 later today
---
Your mom, also do you own a mining permit?
---
The ironic part is... as RPers, we're the ones acting as characters who don't view it as a game. lol
---
Arsia Elkin &gt; "People are *dying!* Do you think this is some sort of *game*!?"
---
No, I'm not surprised. 
---
[This commenter](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c8bv00/iron_crown_input_broadcaster_ccpls_fix/esm1dy1/) revealed that actual broadcasting can also be staggered to avoid detection. So an input multiplexing/broadcasting ban is only going to catch the most obvious people like those in the OP. 
---
I speculate that CCP Security are primarily focusing their limited resources on RMT, and who can blame them? RMT **is** the worse of the two problems. (paging /u/CCP_Peligro \- is my theory correct?)
---
So, to recap - all the ban is *actually doing:* 
---
1. Placing 'law-abiding' multiboxers who do not multiplex/broadcast at risk of false reports
---
2. Placing 'law-abiding' players at a tactical disadvantage against those who broadcast
---
3. Overburdening CCP Support / Security
---
4. Yet another reason to have us feel like our reports don't matter and that CCP doesn't take them seriously
---
5. Eliminating a "cool factor" of EVE that actually drew at least myself to EVE in the first place (see below)
---
Yeah, I'm biased. Years before I joined EVE, the idea of one-person-fleets stuck out as one of the coolest things about EVE to me. I joined EVE after it was banned. I was pissed when I found out. I got over it. I have anxiety issues IRL: I wouldn't dare taking account-ending risks. Period. I won't let others share their accounts with me either. "Everyone does it, nothing bad happens," they say. NOPE. Even if I don't agree with a rule, I follow it -- better safe than constant anxiety (I have anxiety issues IRL) about being caught. So when I see input broadcasters, I report them -- not just because it's the "Right Thing To Do" --- but because I envy them.
---
The ban on broadcasting should be reversed. It's completely ineffective.
---
Why is there not a CCP Bob yet?
---
I think this abandoned concept is a wonderful idea. I'm all for that!
---
And on top of that u/too-lazy-cat if 1Password is something you don't want to use (software as a service and all) look at self hosting your password file with something like keepass, if you need to sync that file to multiple devices use a cloud service or host your own on a raspberry pi with backups
---
proper use of the MJD
---
I would look at the killboard for that information.  I know my corp deploys to Black Rise and we fly fleets from 01:00 to 03:00 when we are participating in FW.  When not in FW we participate in Null PVP.
---
I mean you're NSH, you tell us...
---
Yea the lock time on the Rokh is definitely because of the Small Laser Rokh days lol
---
This image is like watching the airplane film from 1980, you have to look multiple times to notice everything hilarious about this image.
---
It's supposed to be a *game* dude. We play to *have fun*. I think you've lost sight of what's important to you.
---
Here comes the tears of the renter.
---
Right, losing access to them until you firesaled them off at roughly a 15% loss.
---
Sounds oddly familiar...
---
It's something people have been advocating for. 
---
But it's also no reason to not have other security updates
---
You guys are awsome in that case, because you do not drop everything to dead before a nice fight had unfolded. And that is why Geminate seems to be the only region with reliable small-/medscale content atm
---
Don't tell me spider tanking nestors are no longer a thing?! 
---
Also Barghest is a fucking sweet ship, but my god the hull cost!
---
A dozen accounts shooting on the same tick can happen.  The same dozen accounts shooting on the same tick a dozen times is broadcasting.  It's literally the only way that's even possible to achieve given how ping works.
---
Good bot
---
&gt;Provi. Also known as the Farm land.
---
Some folks call life in Provi "Eve played on Hard Mode".  I've become a fan of thinking of it as giving knight odds.
---
This, most of ur old territory were 0.1 systems, so you could really make a living of CloneSoldiers, Mordus BPC and some Blood DED 6/10 and all with PvP-fitted Cruiser-Hulls ...
---
lol this is fantastic
---
I thought that was a nice touch as well
---
&gt;we definitely don't have big toys
---
Why would you lie about something like this on the internet? 
---
We were roaming in enyos and you guys didnt like that we tackled a carrier so you dropped over 20 capitals on maybe 15 *frigates*
---
Well we did it with Dual LSE Ishtar with point, before they nerfed sentry dps  (was some 720 with Curators). Warpin at 100.
---
ye, i havent bought anything, so i cant use the auth qwq
---
also heard SSO has major security issues? atleast v2 does
---
I also didn't like the name, no.  I managed to squeeze 5 focused characters out of 3 random ones and everything is as it should be in the world.
---
Like, from a person you knew personally or from a dark web source that was requesting ISK?
---
What do those cost you? I work for a place that - among other things - sets up custom screen printing and heat transfers. (In fact, I'm the one that coordinates the setup of new designs). I've been curious about how pricing matches up for a while.
---
If anyone is interested in ordering a decent number of shirts or whatever, send me are and I'll get you a rough price. We can do small orders, but you'll pay a lot less for orders of 100+. (Note: I'm not in sales and get no commission, so there'd be nothing in it for me but more work.)
---
I'm not really aware of any major security issues. It's just OAuth2 so it's pretty bog standard as far as SSO goes.
---
Terribly wrong interpretation.
---
Every ship was meant to fight a target almost as big or a ship one tier SMALLER.
---
Battleships have never been good at engaging frigate/ destroyer and they never should/will.
---
You think it is not done to troll the tcu owner or block the use of cyno inhibitors by the tcu owner?

---
1pass lets you self host btw.
---
Can somebody point me in the right direction on how upwell structure ownership works?
---
My brother and I are talking about buying an athanor from another member of our corp who doesnt want to run it anymore. Apparently I will own it, but there are corporation roles i need in order to manage it etc.
---
Does the corp have any ownership of the structure? What if I want to quit the corp, or the corp wants to quit me? What happens to the structure then? Can the director remove me from ownership? Etc etc.
---
Thanks for any direction you can provide.
---
You don't need a cloak. Will you lose your ship? Sure, sometimes. That's why it pays for itself 30x over with an hour or two of explo.
---
Except with citadels you keep your items after the safety kicks in. Where as with outposts I had the pleasure of knowing you couldn’t get your shit out and maybe I could buy it cheap.
---
What kind of formulas/excel functions were being used there that you've used for eve market shenanigans? This might motivate me to take up eve market shenanigans if it increases my know-how with excel.
---
Probably hovering somewhere around familiar and intermediate (nothing - novice - familiar - intermediate - good - skilled - godlike... thats my arbitrary scale)
---
So how would you spend that quarter?
---
Dictors out for Harambe
---
I'm saying that unless their anti-cheat is monitoring other software running on client's computer, they're going to use pretty much exact same methods we are using right now to see if this humanly impossible behavior happens more than once, but with more logs available.
---
I'm aware of the exact measures their anti-cheat is doing, but as far as I'm aware it's not an invasive system, meaning it doesn't have access to all other programs.
---
Seeing how this is clearly a feat only achievable by automation, he should receive a pretty quick response by CCP security team if they're doing anything at all.
---
First
---
But not from your computers perspective.
---
This, so much power creep on platforms like AF, Command Dessis jumping you off gate, Cruiser Hulls easily outdamaging you in combinaton with projection etc ....
---
hmmm, unless this is verified, this guy could have been ratting, then warped into the drifters. Like, jumped a gate and got got.
---
Titan spaming in your face has not to do with your skills.
---
Even, they fought and do stuff. While a lot of ultra PvP elites, do ship spinning and chatwarrior pvp only.
---
The truth
---
I've got a very famous escaped criminal. Wire me the 200b to turn him over to your Lord.
---
I agree with all the points minus the lock speed, battleships have great standard lock range, you can’t have a gate camping/sniping battleship insta locking and popping frigs out past a100km because that’s what would happen. a battleship (Mach) for example will 1 shot frigs and dessies at 100km and do loads of damage to cruisers at that distance, with the amount of mid slots available it would be open to abuse
---

---
If you don't think they have a far more robust logging system then we do, I don't know what to tell you. 
---
Also, there are numerous reasons why they might not take the actions we want them to.

&gt; So either you are master baiting,
---
never not master bait after a long day.

I'd rather have paid character rename service

all models could have their size multiplied by 500 and it wouldn't make a difference other than some hidden flavour text, when everything is at such a big scale such big scale becomes normal.
---
Lots of folks recommend huffing gas in wormholes, but I'm not sure about that.  I'd send some random internet stranger down that route, but I'm not sure I'd send a **friend** that way.  Wormholes can be work to find, and pretty spooky.  Huffing gas is a timed, high risk event.  I have no doubt that if it's executed well it's the best isk/hour for a newbro, what about things like... running the opening tutorials?  That should give you some idea what's fun, and i think the are relatively profitable for a newbro.

This is nice to see, fairly clearly warping to anoms. However I see this as to be much of a threat to normal tatters as well as bots.

tldr
---
CCP wanted to give players the tools to make space empires of their own. Players responded by creating these empires, and losing them is more than they could bare. So players of null all allied together and now the only pvp left is ganking miners in hi-sec.
---
To spice things up CCP created npc attacks on the nullsec structures, not that the npc's ever return to finish the job. It only annoys null leaders because they get so much spam in their mailbox. So now they threaten they're going to war with hi-sec noobs to get revenge on CCP. Screw you CCP they said, how dare you try to prevent us from slowing sucking the life from your game, now we'll make active efforts to kill what remains of hi-sec subscribers. Ha!

JFC just cause the pyfa numbers are high doesn't mean its good IRL fights. t1 BS is gonna fail hard vs 2-3 t2 frigs/dessies. *miss* *miss* *glancing for 12*

only thing t1 BS is used in null fights cause you can max tank it in fleet fights and hope stupid line members broadcast for reps before they die. But if your line members aren't shit you use HACs because they're better then BS in every way.

* You cannot bubble the undock of a fitted citadel like you could with stations to force a fight
---
* the tools CCP gave players to build empire structures that are deliberately denying roaming fun like nearly all nullsec PvE incl. mining moved to Capitals OR subcapital bots

* the growing size of organizations and the growing professionality of "tools" like NEAR2 (intel-channel-local-channel-readout-pingbot)
---
list goes on ... sadly
---
I don't know what you imagine anti-cheat does, but no, it usually doesn't record specific mouse movement and key logging with a millisecond precision in a game like this.
---
You can already see pretty much everything that's happening around you in your logs, and the main difference is that CCP has access to the logs of all players.
---
Yes, CCP is pretty inactive when it comes to punishing people for botting, broadcasting, acc sharing etc - because they don't have enough resources or because they simply do not care, I do not know.

Depends on what ship you are in, and what is waiting for you.  
---
Covops vs Sabre camp: Doubleclick in space away from bubble/sabre if the bubble isn't up yet, cloak and really quickly hit overheared MWD, then change direction by 45 degrees to avoid decloaking.  
---
T1 explo ship: preemptively type 'GF, was close' in local, but do attempt to burn back to the gate with heated propmod. Now if you make it to the gate, and there is only 1 person, hold until he's agressed, hat way he can't follow you through. This one time I was doing a trial to Plex experiment, scored ~3.7b worth of 'Augmented' BPC's, ran into a Sabre in my cloakless Magnate. Not only I got through, I crossjumped the sabre in such a way I got to keep heading my original direction, while he was agressed on the other side. My chair though was permanently clenched up my angus.
---
I want to be like you when I grew up! The hero we don't deserve!
---
This has to be the stupidest "CCPLS" post of the year so far.
---
Why would you ever rebuild the gate since jump freighters and jump clones exist
---
Ya...welcome to the Capital world (aside from carriers). Battleships are basically mini-Dreads.
---
You forgot the CSM campaign of Dunk literally saying that kiting ships are peak faggotery XD ... In Legacy you believe this shit ....
---
Wife was a goon so the two dudes could not have sex. Thankfully the treachery was unmasked and they lived a long and happy life.

Easy: Do it *before* you take their sov. One of my favorite acitivities is to "force" a blob of miners off of their Athanor with a couple gank ships, and then reship to some Endurances and mine it myself while they watch.
---
Well for one they don't need to use gates, which mean they won't instant scrammed.
---
hope it's only botters and alts krabbing it up in that alliance, imagine joining that and thinking that's normal for this game.
---
You don't have to either. Just find a Black ops friend.
---
Lol, CCP afte just trolling us now
---
Insmother is literally Russia, you wont meet many people outside Russia and EU prime
---
so its making ratting a more dangerous activity .. i still see that as a win
---
Thats my point,  why declare war on snuff and then complain about  beeing dropped on by by titans, while this beeing the main reason of the war. Didnt they say they wanted to stop the oppression of lowsec by snuff? Well they got oppressed then.
---
Still not enough blues. Real talk tho, you put a lot of effort into this and its pretty fucking 14/10
---
True, Hi btw old Paradise dweller. Lived next door to you multiple times, PO4 was our staging back then. Good times back then, no citadel spam in U-Q ...
---
but we are talking about t1 battleships friendo, i knew you were going to bring up black ops.
---
I would pay for you to biomass your characters and never play or talk about this game again :)
---
THIS is what I've been planning to do. You literally took this from my brain... are you me?
---
they need to do a balance pass to make short range BS guns into dread-lite HAW guns. Yes this means t1 BS will 100% SHIT on t2/tri frigs and dessies but be ineffective vs BC/BS+.
---
There are far more abandoned citadels in high sec than null. The drifters should be rolling through high sec.
---
Micro jump drive ❌
---
Micro dunk drive ✔️
---
It's because with the reduction of the base scan res to reduce lock speed to that time would make it trivial to sensor booster them into instalocking snipers the likes Battlecruisers already can achieve.
---
You should've seen the carnage I can inflict with my instalock Tornados with 10k alpha.
---
You mean a sensor booster they can already fit?
---
The lock time really fucked battleships up with the latest change to ecm drones. It is almost impossible to kill them without a smartbomb because in the time you take to lock one it decycles and another drone hits the jam cancelling targeting.
---
You're saying I don't have to use Stargates... That's only true if I have someone that lights a cyno. That's no different than you having a blops jump you somewhere.
---
Lets troll them right back by ganking everyone in jita
---
We have confirmation of them warping to a Forsaken Hub.
---
what can i say.  eve is for nerds who are to nerds what nerds are to regular people
---
Depends if it's insta-death which drifters practically are.
---
Woah a actual good EVE event that dunks botters and annoys dumb null krabs
---
I moved to Iceland.
---
It's pretty much insta-death for anything that isn't a super.
---
Lol i managed to solo a active rep dommi in a hawk took fucking forever but was fun even though I had to kill something like 40 drones whilst he was capping himself out xo

This is just 1 example and it only works if you're going against pve ships that use EM drones for ratting. But still, it's fun to watch how fighters can't do shit against the wolf
---
Imagine thinking that instablapping drifters warping to anomalies is good for the game
---
Would you be happier if they named them Drifter Drive Thru's?
---
eve a super dies fast,  each bs is 1.5k dps

Well considering PanFam had to form 600 dudes (290 Eagles + 90 Muninns + 40 Basis alone) to secure a Fortizar Killmail versus 10 guys from unspoken and 50 Cerbs from Thera, i get a grip on why you have no fun.
---

*"You know what? Structure bashing is bullshit, let's just find the nearest HS exit hole and roam a bit"* - probably Drifters this morning.
---
F - Very sorry to hear this, I was introduced to FW against Conoco as a new member of GoG and for the better part of 2 yrs I too battled Simetry at every turn.
---
It was truly amazing to see the later change of sides and his total commitment to the eradication of his old Corp.  
---
Camp and cloak. I said that's fine. You seem to hate idea of having to adapt to fuel. That's your issue. Not mine. You can accomplish the same thing while not allowing abusive afk behavior. There's a difference if a Rorq walks away. Someone can still kill him. There's risk. Something you obviously don't care to have in your "playstyle". That says a lot about you. Maybe you should go play WoW.
---
Imagine thinking that Drifters instablapping botters is bad for the game
---
If you're in a umbrella just shoot them with your supers ez
---
cool
---
The discussion is about how PvP is increasingly tedious and boring and entirely not worth the time in null (a problem that made me quit fucking 2 years ago). You're not seeing the whole picture if you fail to see the problem with empire building.
---
Machs are the only BS I've enjoyed flying in a fleet.
---
Not counting blops, which are their own thing.
---
I've been mission running there myself. It's so unbelievably quiet there.
---
if bu annoys krabs you mean fucks any thing that's not a super over making it a death wish to rat in any thing smaller, then yes
---
Yeah, because you can cyno in your standing fleet in the half a second it takes for them to lock you up and kill you.
---
Seriously, this would be a million times better if you could fight back at all, such as the case of when they’re attacking structures, but this is just so stupid
---
Are the drifters still overpowered (aka, 100+ km point, DD, nearly instant lock, can't scan them, can't d-scan them)?
---
If so, there's even less counter play than when they were just shooting structures.  Null should be dangerous but a pilot who's paying attention and not botting should be able to warp off.   Let's be honest, if this was happening in HS to say miners and mission runners, they'd be screaming about it as well.
---
Totally agree, I feel like the people who "ree" hardest about PHP haven't actually written any since 7.0 came out.
---
It's not all sunshine and rainbows but it's not as bad as people make it out to be.
---
Look the point is capital ships are played differently most of the time. They'll survive even if they are scrammed because they'll cyno in for help or they can just welp anything at close or long range. To top it off, if you don't have enough points on a capital ships, he's going to fuck off.  
---
Name me 1 fucking t1 battleship that's going to sacrifice 1 high slot for a cyno unless they are trying to bait a fleet?   
---
A t1 battleship is dead meat once it's scrammed on a gate.
---
&gt;uch of a story. I still wear the shirt
---
:)
---
A bit related to your question : the EVEMon application allow you to check how many skill injectors you need for a specific skill plan, it does come in handy.
---
&gt; without shaking EvE's basis
---
That's sort of the point. People are people, but people are constrained and guided by the system that they're interacting with. It's CCP's sandbox. They've designed the sandbox to kill small/medium scale PvP and incentivize empire building. They didn't *have* to design it this way. But they did, now we have the two faction null and nothing to do in their glorious sandbox. I have no idea how you're failing to see the problem and how CCP's decisions have created the current situation.
---
I thought weed was expensive these days?
---
The many will become one when one become four.  
---
Just sayin.
---
I was in FEDUP for a while. And another alliance in the area, I forget its name. It really isn't that great.
---
They do need engineering complexes to make it profitable and avoid as many taxes as possible. So you are saying if nullsec retracts its stocks from the entire market system all of high sec could keep the prices in check and relatively the same within 5% of the current rates?
---
The only place I'd bother with is wormhole space. But that is its own form of tedium that requires a significant time investment (that I can't dedicate anymore).
---
Thanks! That means a lot to me, I always try and do my best!
---
So you're annoyed you can't solo these guys with a ratting sub?? 
---
gg
---
Having no idea how the skins are actually managed, it seems like it could be handled like a subsystem on t3, rather then a skin, lock it in with director roles for citadel owner.
---
I absolutely love the clip with the hawk and the Wolf - the Hawk is using Precision Lights and the Wolf is using 280 arties, whille orbiting 500 with MWD on :D
---
great video Asilthar!
---
I bet if you warp in a procuror they all warp off and let you mine
---
Not quite 5%, but within 20% easily, and the big outliers there would be the usual expensive pirate ships and deadspace modules. 
---
Plus, all of null won't. Because it's profitable as shit. 
---
And any price increases would be easy to handle when l the stuff empire players sell goes for a similar increase in value. 
---
Y'all just aren't as important as you think.
---
It's the bot I mean VNI AFK army!
---
Not at all, I just don’t see how it’s a good mechanic when you have zero chance of even being able to fight back.
---
CCP PLEASE
---
CCP are only doing what their Hillmar said he was going to do, fuq the game up and then rebuild.  That is fine, its their game.  Ill hang around to see where it goes, but my feeling is that this is all about the thousands of omega accounts that plex rather than sub.  I believe that CCP want to try to reduce the ISK faucets, and then see if peeps Sub, rather than PLEX, as at the end of the day its all about the almighty dollar.  If subscriptions drop, and the number of Omega accounts also drop, then this experiment will also drop.  And to all you Hi Sec pubbies crowing about this, just remember,   all your T2 materials comes from Null, so this will also impact on you.
---
Didn't adress what I said.
---
Didn't realize you were talking to the wrong person.
---
\&gt; TFW you are actually a dumbass.
---
Now if only they would attack regions/null based on population density, citadel spam and mining activity. :)

I especially enjoy saying it. :)

Huh, just got an anonymous email saying "Go fuck yourself. -xoxo Hilmar."

"Cash me ousside" - Artemis Tyrannos
---
The drifter invasion fleets don't have DDs.
---
They do drag. They have to exist before you warp though.
---
This is not true. Proving Conduits appears a couple of hours a day, and can appear only in one player from several at the same time in the abyss at the same time. As a result, we have that the players receive PVE gates and do not use them, and PVP players spend time on not efficient PVE. Obviously, this mechanic is broken, and ultimately will lead to the removal of this type of content from the game, due to the fact that it is not used, because the developers simply do not allow players to use this content.
---
I stopped playing for years and when I last played I flew a BS mostly the typhoon and it was pretty good for how cheap it cost to lose.  It would hit for over 1000 dps at 120km.  I logged in a couple of months ago to check it out and its a very different game for sure.  Most of the things I liked about flying a BS seem to be gone now, in fact, I'm pretty much having to relearn the game it's been that long and it's that different.  I knew they had made some balance changes but damn I gotta figure out this crap all over again.
---
Or Abnormalies :)
---
We’re not trying to ruin “The Game” just some random elderly guy who like trading in games like privateer back in the 90s game.

---
Hahaha, love it :D
---
Please stop being so fucking retarded, the rest of the world will appreciate that you at least try.
---
You mean fleet fights happen with ships other than Munins? :O
---
As someone who’s actively bitched about the drifter invasion, I support this. It would give players a way to interact, study and destroy them. You know, what makes Eve great.
---
Totaly agree the lp generated can be used to fund fleets an srp will prob go a long way to seeing more fleet participation and give incentive to fly logi mabye.
---
I translated stories for a friend to rekindle a relationship with another friend.
---
Friend A played a lot of eve, to where most of his time was spent playing the game. Friend B did not. Friend A would tell friend B about his day, but friend B had no idea what a point or a dread bomb was. Having played the game a fair bit, I would translate into plain English what friend A was talking about to friend B. Friend A met friend B in high school, but lost touch when we all went to the same university because he never left his dorm. 5 years later they are now best friends again because they can actually have conversations... thanks to a cheat sheet I gave friend B.
---
Its a surprise mechanic
---
I liked the concept of drifters being a threat making null more dangerous. But instablapping people without even getting a chance to run away is kinda lame.
---
HS will be screaming soon enough.
---
Jumpgates already existed. They arent the cause of the problem.
---
But yeah, nullsec has very little reason to go to do anything but blue anyone who can actually do any damage to you. 
---
There is no way to profit from pillaging.  Taking someone else's space doesn't get you anything other than more systems you have to defend.
---
Kicking down thier sandcastles just means you have to build your own.
---
Roaming into thier space doesnt get you anything more than a few VNI kills and maybe a super fleet dropped on you
---
That and its fucking impossible to assault an alliance from another TZ. 
---
Something needs to change to make deep nullsec more vulnerable and more worth roaming and attacking.
---
More NPC nullsec systems, longer dread jump range,  no asset safety, and removing infinitely spawning anoms would be a start. 
---
Doing something about citadel timers would be another.
---
Added those through twitch for lols.
---
Plexing is better for CCP than subbing because they get more money. Also, if CCP really want fuck the game up so they can rebuild I would question both their sanity and intelligence. A "reset" so to speak of null can't be achieved without hard resetting the entire server, because there will be hundreds if not thousands of accounts with tremendous assets to their name, that could just be resubbed at a moments notice.
---
How did I get dragged into this?
---
YAY some good news about this!
---
The salt is strong with this one.
---
Yes anything short of a capital gets insta popped.
---
No I am annoyed that there is no way to counter them. They show up, insta pop the ratter and that's it.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/77437471/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77437471/)
---
Seems this is the player and the setup.
---
Null needs to be fundamentally changed.  Players are rewarded for grouping together en masse.  
---
Instead, players should have incentive to spread out.  Systems should only be able to sustain a certain number of players.
---
Step one: change to linux
---
If you cant do within 5%, you have failed. 20% is not a success. More than half the goods in the game come from nullsec. Especially in the ore and pi departments. Pi sucks in high and null. Enjoy paying more for fuel and everything else.
---
Also strong with the Krabs crying no counter play
---
Im all for making lp income more generated throught killing enime players but what solves that getting abused like it did in the past. As it stands now you are not rewarded all that much for killing the oposing faction and the removal of fw missions kills a lot of income for people myself included unless they buff the amount plexes gives or the way lp is split beteeen numerous people most wont be able to make enought for pvp in fw meaning they will need to go to other ways of making isk outside fw which I find a problem.
---
Yes, I know. It has been pointed out by others that the prime area of concern is solely the simultaneous module activation.
---
"if peeps Sub, rather than PLEX"
---
you are so dumb. Plex has to be bought with real money.
---
I'll be waiting.
---
TEST will be forced into Saranen, right next to da goons.
---
Best way for new players to get into PVP is FW imo. Would love to see a thoughtful revamp.
---
Ahh takes me back to 2008 when I started first time in lowsec out in a Rifter looking for some 1v1’s  looking to get into pvp, and a tempest insta locks me on my decloack, there’s a flash some loud alarm  and I’m sat in my pod good times .... xo
---
An easy way to fix this is making armor plate and shield extender have additional ability to mitigate a fixed amount of damage per hit. That is to say, more immune to small weapon fire.
---
I mean, I think this is hilarious but I'm still very much game to shut down hisec. The difference is that I don't feel any need to justify it.
---
&gt;  it's always been like this.
---
No, it hasn't.
---
You're missing the point: Battleships are meant for one thing in this game -- extra DPS, just like in the real world. They're ships designed to be weapon platforms, and very little else.
---
Not that easy.

So in your opinion it's a good thing to deploy an unstoppable mechanic that prevents players from using part of the game, with no counter available?

If that's the case the hype wouldn't have a rep bonus and their dps to hp/repair ability ratio would be more along the lines of a talos

---
Just look at the gnosis best camping ship on a budget it’s not hard to get it to lock frigs,
---
 with the amount of mid slots a bs has even a moderate boost to sensor strength will put it dangerously close to being on par with the gnosis but being able to tank longer and shoot from much further away
---
Fourth state, fifth state. A some point an abandoned citadel becomes an NPC squat.  The model changes in several states to a new state, i.e. taken over, refitted, partially dismantled. It starts generating pirates, drones, etc. Make these deserted junk piles in to a nuisance. Make the nuisance get gradually worse.

Err...what? They have a rep bonus because they're sitting in place blapping stuff. Dreads do, too.

I think that vid shows that it's been that way since 2013-2014 which is considered the "Golden Age" of Eve. I absolutely know it has been 2-3 big null coalitions ruling over nullsec since at least 2015 when I started playing.

---
They've already proven though multiple game failures that the people that made EVE magic are no longer with the company.  If they want to kill it and rebuild, they may as well just skip step 2 and close down the company.
---
This was all in BOBs plan 🙏
---
And costs more than a sub too.. There is so much wrong with this postI don't even know where to start.
---
Yes, mass infinitely respawnings anoms has made things much worse.  Why spread out your thousands of players when it's much safer and more efficient to keep them all in a small secure area.
---
It was called years ago that this was killing the game. May as well have just created infinitely an respawning money tree and resource tree that you only need to control in a single region to get all your mega zerg alliance would ever need. What could go wrong? Total and utter stagnation of the game perhaps?

How about counter play, if it's an invasion why can't I do anything to stop it or slow it down. All we have are unstoppable packs of ships they insta pop anything smaller than a cap, and force caps off grid.

Any software that allows a local database will do just fine. You can export a encrypted backup to a cloud service/small remote vm or just an USB stick in a different house.

I'd like to see a skill point respec at 500 isk per skill point. Expensive enough not to be abused, cheap enough to be useful to low skilled players that may have found a different direction they want to take their pilots in. If some 200m SP guy wants to respec by all means let him. At 100b for the respec still seems reasonable to me.
---
no shit, nobody else bothered to set up the infrastructure required to shit out 4 figures worth of titans.
---
Everyone belongs to the alliance they flair.
---
As a ninja looter/salvager I believe anything done with a yellow wreck should incur suspect status. Would make the trig invasion so much more interesting and content from it would be awesome
---
It aroused me, greatly.
---
*cries in Alpha*
---
For sure. Main advantage of using something like 1pass is just all the features. 1pass also lets me autofill pretty much everything in forms, CC details, SSN, firefox extension so it is super easy to use, etc etc. I could replicate most of that with other software but I'm lazy and 1pass makes it easy. Plus, I have an old perpetually licensed version, so no subscription fee.
---
Death to all VNIS
---
Ehh, POS had hangars before. it was more the cloning that makes citadels better. Someone puts an astrahous in your system, and they have a home base they can deathclone/jumpclone to, right on your doorstep. 
---
But, i dont think this is really an issue. It makes nullsec more dangerous, and conflict easier.
---
Retard Alert!
---
Immen and tenerifis
---
Awe, poor little guys standing fleet and cyno wont stop every threat, WHATEVER WILL WE DO
---
They do not unless CCP changed it in the past 48 hours.
---
They're not DD fit
---
mm actually no.   the new ones dont give Jump fatigue. 
---
Also, small capitals can use them.
---
kiters ramming everywhere.
---
Wow that is shitty
---
I'm so glad highsec discovered the salt meme a decade later
---
Are We?
---
I cant tell if this is a serious comment in support of CCP's stupidity or an ea reference
---
When you cry so hard you create bad press about the game you supposedly love ....
---
Well played.
---
Far from. Your doing what works for you.  Making meaningful content for u and ur guys. It shows a failure of the QFC to work together and adapt to fight. Instead they only cared about their own space instead of the greater good of the region. 
---
SMA I'm sure was really fun fights for u and that's what the game is about. But the war of attrition, they clearly lost standing up to a better FC team and a pvp focused group. 
---
I'm sure in its own ways u wish they had put up a better fight with maybe a cap fight here and there. But you have had ur fun. And I know you well enough. Even with the imperium sending over their 150 man fleets. You will make them work for every ihub and tcu they destroy. Making th3 bleed for every step. It's why I can say without a doubt you have always been one of the most fun FCS to work with and vs. Same with IA.
---
I liked the idea until you mentioned mining. Not everything needs to be about mining.
---
BTW the Chinese named "Angel Battleship: Machariel"
---
A more effective way to do this would be to keep finding wormholes into rental systems, quickly blow up whatever Rorquals you can get, leave. In fact, all of J-Space should declare a truce and organize a great Black Crusade against the null coalitions. Let SovNull burn. Let them know fear. If anything not blue is in local, thy should worry about stealth bombers.
---
No shit Batman, and if you cant earn enough ISK to plex your account, because you ratter keeps getting ganked by drifters, what are you going to do.
---
i think this could work pretty well, maybe even have the scale of the invasion based on system index
---
But but but muh space empire :&lt;
---
Name goons you know that still pay real money for their sub
---
He's a wormholer btw, can't you read?
---
The years prior to that are what built Eve to what it was during the "Golden Age". The moment the mega coalitions started to take control is what began the downward spiral to the slow death of Eve that we have now, so don't get confused about what it is that made Eve great.
---
code does it first
---
They wont be.  There's just gonna be alot of "kay...?"
---
&gt;"What's the netflix password?"
---
It's **pay4iturself123!**
---
&gt; There is no way to profit from pillaging. Taking someone else's space doesn't get you anything other than more systems you have to defend.
---
I dunno, it sure looks like Goons had fun popping the HK structures. Maybe we need more of that in NS?
---
Was looking for this old thread
---
Thanks for the reposting
---
o7.. Ed also lost one recently. 
---
Hurts to loose our brother.
---
Idk man.  I've always had a bit of a IRL mentality towards big ships in this game.  
---
Kind of like in real life, big ships need escorts/screens of destroyers/cruisers.  Otherwise they'll actually get blapped by some random torpedo boat...
---
Eve should be no different.  Big ships should be forced to have support to be effective, and not receive some super hero solo god treatment that can engage everything and anything solo that is smaller than them.
---
Just use a titan from your titan fleet.
---
iOS is Unix based already, a Mac is just a overpriced, locked down Linux machine.
---
Its a song about EVE says in the title man.
---
and people should care why exactly?
---

---
Because something interesting is happening in this stagnant ebin game??

O7, fellow LowSec person.

Sucks to get dropped. Test downvote team is already here lol
---
That statement was true 10 years ago before the introduction of supers, carriers and titans before the dreadnoughts were considered the bulk of your forces.  
---
EVE has drastically changed and evolved and that's no longer the case or the META.

keep it up, your almost reaching querns-tier posting, quality stuff

---
Thanks for the nice write up! As it may or may not be obvious, when I played I mainly stated in high sec. I want to change that up now coming back to the game as a breath of fresh air. 
---
I never really crossed into low/null as bubbles always scarred me, plus I viewed them kinda as a cheap mechanic slapping them next to gates. I never liked this idea even to this day but not going to deter me this time.
---
cRinGe RecOrDs
---
so you're saying there are more goons than the rest of eve combined or...? Merriam-Webster may have to come up with a new term for goon salt it seems
---
This is disgusting. They login, activate hack and warp to the site before they even materialize. Litteraly. There is just no time to do anything else. Like how is this supposed to be fair. Meanwhile Falcon is parading around saying that we should calm down and that everything is fine.
---
steven messner is a fucking retard by the way
---
I'd be okay with that as long as all previous names were visible on the character info screen.
---
High frequency trading, you say?
---
Heya! I originally posted this Drifter shipline a little over a year ago - in the time since then, I've made some pretty significant adjustments and iterations on what I originally put down, and yesterday I decided to go through and update as much of it as I could (and give it all a bit more grounding by adding calculation sections)~
---
I've got no idea what CCP's plans are for the Drifters, but I hope that, if we ever got their ships, they'd turn out something like this - even if they don't, it's been a great exercise in design &amp; other stuff for me, so it's a win-win sort of thing :)
---
No idea where people are getting goons from sovnull is their largest sub base if
---
No, very much different.
---
1. they don't give fatigue like the old ones.
---
2. You cannot stop people using them; previously you could bubble and point a ship to stop them taking it, now only them agressing prevents jumping.
---
3. Caps can take them, very minor IMO but a difference none the less.
---
OP, you absolute muppet, come back here so we can bully you
---
*Just Olivia Gabal things*
---
I think it's okay if you encrypt it before putting it into your password app. Use 7-zip or whatever and put a password on it.
---
Can you please explain how plexing is better than Subs, for CCP.  All plexing does is allow those who are able to generate enormous incomes play Eve for free.  Which is the reason the big empires continue to grow at the expense of the smaller groups.  The Plex they buy comes from the pay to win whales, that can afford to not grind an income, in game.
---
That's blasphemy
---
UwU
---
Can someone explain why it is a bad idea to warp within 0 on gates in low/null? Warping this close would allow you to jump right away. Is it done to prevent campers jumping in with you the same time?
---
Let's say I just entered a low sec system, coming from a .5 system. Now I have to take another gate. My pve self would normally jump within 0 and jump. Now I know it's best to do a scan of the gate im heading to next, and when done and nothing comes back, do you still avoid warping within 0?
---
? New Jumpgates fucking suck. Making geography irrelevant is not cool.
---
butt clench moment
---
goons are the ones crying about it the hardest so its fairly obvious
---
Please repost here so I don't get AIDS IRL from reading eve-o forums.  
---
Thx
---
The thing that's confusing me lately is that getting a few VNI kills and a super fleet drop used to be enough.  People used to roam just to cause some chaos and die gloriously, and groups that did it enough would give one another gudfites just for the fun of it.
---
Why did that apparently stop at some point?
---
Insta gibbing NPCs that don't show up in local or dscan and have no countering mechanics whatsoever?
---
Sweet, gotta Love game mechanics where the counter is to log out of the game. Should be great for the health of EVE.
---
If you were to uncloak do you regain control or do you have to fly over to them and scoop them back up?
---
Because CCP gets more $$$ for every month of omega paid through plex than through subs. I don't know the lowest respective amount, but a sub is around $10 a month while the same amount of plex is noticably more.
---
Ever since ccp nerfed BS warp speed they have been less satisfying.  Anything but a Mach is only ever used with a titan bridge because they are awful to take gates with.
---
Lock speed is too slow and it doesn’t really make any sense. Bigger ship should have more sensors??
---
 "Think of the Goon children"   
---
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    
---
 "Think of the Goon children" (also "What about the largest subscriber base?") is a cliché that evolved into a rhetorical tactic. Literally it refers to Goons and pets rights (as in discussions of slave labour). In debate, however, it is a plea for pity that is used as an appeal to emotion, and therefore it becomes a logical fallacy. Most closely associated with the transitive, past-tense verb "driftered"
---
If at least two big blocs aren't destroyed from this then fuck it
---
It's funny just how many years ago this exact same statement has been being made, often with concrete examples of how it could be done mechanically.  Forever to be ignored it feels like.
---
The amount of salt from coalition leadership is heartwarming.  The display of entitlement and hand waving is something to see.  Praise CCP on this one.
---
Exactly. Make it take wayyy more space to sustain the current player count.
---
I'm not even a goon and I'm pretty supportive of the event pretty confused on how this thread constitutes as 'salt'
---
Hope yas enjoy :)
---
This dude learned the word “unprecedented” recently and is exited to show off his new vocabulary.
---
Also true.
---
You do understand that in wh space citadels drop loot while in kspace they do not, right?
---
It adds an additional element of risk, but that should always be present. Players have for too long taken advantage of game systems and used them for purposes they were not originally intended for to make the game safer. Now CCP has implemented a system to add that risk back in that they don't have the ability to work around, and they are fuming about it.
---
it's sarcasm friend, you are providing me with entertainment before the slog to work

It is good for the game. You carebears to to stop crying and HTFU.
---
because the event progression is time gated
---
i'm sure eventually you'll get your shot to fight back and repel the invasion, for now we're in the shock and awe phase of getting murdered
---
i really don't think making nullsec temporarily super dangerous to make people actually care about the npc invasion is a heinous crime
---
at least it's something new
---
Can't use bubbles in lowsec. Also, you can explore in an interceptor that's immune to bubbles, or a strategic cruiser. Pretty much anything in Eve has some form of countermeasure, so don't let any mechanics discourage you.
---
I'm with Falcon on this one. Pull your fucking panties out of your snatch and chill the fuck out.
---
Do the drifters insta-lock and point when they land in a site? I'd assume that any non-afk ratter (ha) would have time to warp out as the drifters land.
---
Steve, you need to stop just pushing every bullshit you see here into the magazine, it's not helping you career mate.
---
He's far more stupid than querns tbh.
---
Great. This will fix the game!

---
Hm, so maybe if a clone vat bay is fitted it could make citadel capturable?
---
Yes, make an already irritating necessity even more irritating via OP oneshot rats that don't punish bots more than normal players.   That's surely gonna get people to play more, and not drive more people to bot/quit.  Oh wait...
---
People still not having a clue how PLEX works in tyool 2019.
---
Ccp confirmed they dont have a DD and said to file a bug report if they fire one.
---
Falcon is a fucking moron, news at 11?
---
ok at lest theres that, the dd is a cool thing but it makes there op as hell in groups
---
Does it still count if I haven’t logged in for the last 2 months?
---
Do you want an honest answer or a memy answer?
---
The old POS jumpbridges were functionally identical
---
Not really, you could speed tank them if you also TDed em, when they had drifter incursions
---
It's basically CCP admitting they have no fucking idea how to actually fix the game, so they resort to oneshot hacking PVE mobs to do the work for them.  Dunno about you, but that sounds like they've given up on an actual engaging fix to the game's problems.
---
Goon's idea of fun is not really what the rest of eve tends to enjoy. They didn't even really get fights out of it.
---
It's about not caring, if these invasions were attached to something we could go kill stop then, you would have heard significantly less complaints. Instead the only option is don't play the game for a week. Encouraging people to not play sounds like a pretty bad idea to me.
---
i believe they buffed then since then, the  have perfect tracking right now. though i dont know about the dd's
---
 Maybe you should terminate eve process before launch new.  I mean kill it,  cruelly murder process in task manager.
---
Amen.
---
I'm not complaining but I never saw you guys talking about an equal fight, you're just always bragging if you won over your enemy when you outnumbered them :) but yes, this is what eve fights became
---
No the DDs could be TD/speed tanked. It was a thing we did with the incursions, through disposable thrashers.
---
Shame it didn't
---
I bet CCPearl Abyss will soon start selling drugs in the NEX store that make you immune to drifter aggro for 24 hours.
---
All PLEX came from someone buying it for more than the cost of a sub. Meaning if everyone who you bought plex from to plex your account paid for that plex with $5 packs then CCP got a total of around $22.72 for your sub for that month.
---
" its not like you can instalock and blap frigs with Large turrets"
---
Ah reminds me of the good old days with 'no stacking penalty'   :)
---
oh man :(
---
There are people who are new enough to not understand this fine piece of memery it seems
---
It shouldn't require that. The process should correctly terminate itself when the launcher is closed.
---
No, they weren't?
---
I think we need less retarded threads for a change. (not expecting for that to happen, of course.)
---
How did i even not see that after 2 minutes of staring at the image ...
---
You may want to prepare yourself for disappointment.
---
Ah ok I had always feared them and thought they could be used in any system below .05
---
Because getting dropped on by supers didnt really happen as often. 
---
The supers had more to fear, because any roamer could be bait carrying a dreadbomb cyno. Now there are vast swaths of nullsec that are outside dread range from NPC stations, and nobody krabs in the systems that are, unless they're bait
---
I've made this argument over and over. It always gets down voted, because I think players are innately against increased risk.
---
ah ok, i only even though them in a supper carrier because i was to worried about getting one shot in any thing smaller.  
---
but ive always heard things about them that makes me think they have gone way to far int the "scary alien battle ship off doom"  side off them. they always sounded like the needed tuning down. like the response drifters are
---
Just to get the price up.
---
Like i said, its not really a problem. If you put a structure into its hull timer, all services turn off for a week and they loose all thier clones get deleted.
---
Praise Bob!!!
---
eve could use its own dictionary
---
Let me put it to you this way, if there was no plex on the market, and then CCP sold $10000 dollars of worth of Plex, they would still only have $10000 dollars, so how do they earn more $$$$ from Omega accounts that use ISK to buy Plex.
---
Am I the only one hoping this is all a massive plot to make the NPC Empires fightwith the player empires? I know its extremely unlikely but it would be pretty kickass.
---
Defeating the blob one moon walk at the time.
---
That is pretty much what it feels like, but most of reddit seems to be glad nullsec has no ability to respond.
---
Yeah, cause you're logged-off in one.
---
Yass we always need more weeb stuff :)
---
Well assuming they are presented (sort of) as race with wormhole origin, no FOB is required. I like this ninja approach more, jump out of nowhere, fuck somebody up, disappear.
---
so here's the problem
---
you want fast ships with high alpha that heat to incredible alpha 
---
this will secure alpha strike dominance in all fleet situations forever and it's the most boring fucking gameplay ever because there's no play to make, just alpha ships and get alphaed until someone wins 
---
you know why trigs are balanced at 2.5k dps? because it takes a minute and a half straight or shooting the same guy to get there. they have all the time in the world to do literally anything to stop you from doing what you want to do, so your gameplay is trying to keep your guns firing and their gameplay is trying to stop you
---
what you propose is land, lock, blap, leave. 
---
please for the love of God don't let anyone at ccp think this should be implemented . it's a lot of effort into a well formatted , but fundamentally terrible idea.
---
I'm sorry you or whoever wrote it wasted their time in exactly the worst thing possible in pvp because it would be unquestionably the best in everything except structure bashes
---
Excuse me June is over now it's illegal to be pcgaymer
---
Just do what the rest of the people who share your view point are doing; quit. Most of the people who want EVE to be dangerous, and made the game great, are cutting back their accounts and quitting, let the carebears have their sandbox and pretend.
---
no poors
---
This is the greatest expansion ever.  Even if I get blown up by these drifters over and over, it is still amazing.  CCP and their balls.
---
No, just random loot tables.
---
[Remembering training AWU V before injectors.](https://i.imgur.com/LJDyuNs.gif)
---
In what way? They had the same ranges and restrictions. They made space just as "small"
---
The only thing that annoyed me was the bad reddit posting it generated
---
reading cnn in 2019 lal
---
when will drifters start hunting rorqs and stealing ore
---
be careful or /u/avree will strike you down for this stale meme
---
you're being hyperbolic, there is tons of content in the game that is not affected by the drifters
---
Locked, stocked, and rdy
---
This is a fine reference.
---
Speaking from a small gang perspective that was never fun. VNI ganking has always been boring. We used to get blobbed sand and we'd deal with it by fighting it if we thought we had the slightest chance of killing something, or we'd leave if it was guaranteed fun police fleet. Now those fleets don't come, it's the Swiss army knife capitals that require a reship that roamers can't do. Fuck HAW dreads and support fighters. What happened to capitals need sub caps as support?
---
If CCP wants to remove ratting, they can just do that directly.
---
Making ratting massively more risky without nerfing other pve income just means ratters will switch to something less risky. Nothing changes in the grand scheme of things except that more people will do stuff they enjoy even less than ratting.
---
Everyone replying to this like its not pasta
---
What kind of better performance would we expect from this? And what are the optional 13-17 steps for?
---
Exactly. Because someone had to buy these $10000 of plex for them to be used by "free" players. Whereas CCP would only have made maybe $5000 if all the omega accounts that used that Plex had been subscribed directly.
---
&gt;since 2013  
---
&gt;\-  
---
&gt;2014 which is considered the "Golden Age" of Eve
---
As someone who has played from around the start of the servers untill a bit over a year ago i'd say that eve's gameplay aspect was allready going down around that time
---
I want more drifters killing people not less
---
Remembering losing AWU V before clone upgrades were removed.
---
Except NSH and Darwinism accidentally half the region
---
You would have to get within control range, right click on your capacitor, and select "reconnect to lost drones".
---
&gt; Now CCP has implemented a system to add that risk back
---
lamo.
---
If you truly believe drifters are anything more than a poorly thought "invasion event" gimmick I've got a bridge to sell
---
Makes me sad
---
real talk: this was not challenging or engaging. neither one of us should really be proud of it
---
Yeah. I've been saying it for years now that JB's are not good for the game. It used to be fun protecting a pipe by having to form a fleet and removing the threat to our space. As a current roamer who didn't get to small gang before JB's I'd love to experience the roamer perspective. It's like playing cops and robbers in space where there's an actual chance and the geography matters. Right now it doesn't.
---
It just called to me and I had to do it
---
Because the PLEX is bought by someone else and he then sells it ingame again. PLEX aren't generated out of thin air.
---
Well, it's a step in the right direction.
---
Which is any direction tbf
---
other than a few people on r/eve jacking themselves off - is anyone logging in to eve more because of it?
---
I can imagine him looking like one of those phone operator ladies in John wick :D
---
This was confirmed by CCP Lebowski in a recent Tweet. 
---
Also, just because this event is messing with the (economic/organisational) certainty that NUL blocks have become used to, doesn't make it wrong. Messing with High Sec in response is fine and appropriate and Eve like - Do it. Eve=Chaos &amp; Chaos=Good
---
Everything is too certain, too gamed, too predictable and always known in advance by meta players through the CSM. CSM peeps are good people, it's just that the data on player count says that they have failed to help CCP make the right calls about game mechanics.
---
Early Eve was more dangerous but the sense of achievement was higher, nul pilot participation in player led Orgs was greater but the game was ugly, less refined, lower populated and buggy, with fewer features.
---
Support CCP getting uncertainty back into Eve.
---
Resist the sheep like urge to go along with the Eve Media, especially the large alliances - use them to be in big fights but don't let them take away uncertainty, it's not in your interest.
---
Ok that makes perfect sense to me, thanks.  Now the weird part is that Eve went through another period strugging with almost the same issue, with caps having perfect projection against subcaps and not requiring support so they became an oppressive omnipresent solution for everything and annihilated fun.  But the past apparently wasn't learned from...

i experienced pvp today in null and lost. just sayin'.
---
b/c flair is totally accurate on here
---
You couldn't jump back and forth multiple times every minute, you could have fights on them by bubbling enemy fleets. You couldn't; take 8 jumps to go from Delve to the edge of Pureblind, take 4 Jbs to go from 1 end of the drones to the other in 10 minutes with a fleet.
---
There is a very big difference between the old Jump bridges and the new ones; the old ones where an alternative to a titan bridge and had a set of limitations that balanced them, the new ones have no balancing aspects to them to prevent abuse.
---
So one of the main things players do in this game is being actively discouraged and you think that's a good thing?
---
&gt; I still remember the moment of panic when I saw the “Las Vegas - 20 miles” sign when I was in New Mexico.
---
Took a wrong turn at Albuquerque.
---
what are the current CSMs doing, other than threatening hisec with a "trade war"?
---
You should warp to 0. You shouldn’t warp gate to gate if you’re aren’t in something bubble immune. 
---
With bubbles in null you can setup stop or drag bubbles either before or after the gate. They are setup to catch people warping gate to gate. 
---
If you bounce off a midpoint like a planet or belt or something then it changes your line of approach and you can warp to 0 from there without getting caught in the bubble and jump through.
---
Tbf, if you didn't I would have.
---
kk thanks for being here, Sophocles.

That hurts. I'm glad i was always diligent enough to remember my upgrades.

Totally agree, I quit in 2016 with the thought of never coming back. HIC's with scram range that was further than a standard point + insta death fighters was the last straw for me coupled with RL obligations. Coming back they at least fixed HIC's, but now a carrier can point, web, and kill all with it's own fighters. Not to mention the things you listed. CCP has been way too slow to change things and notice trends. Games like R6, or LoL get balance patches monthly. Destiny has a dev team that writes a weekly lengthy blog post detailing what's in the pipeline. CCP gives us an EVE Pulse here and there usually lacking in substance and feels like a waste of time to watch.
---
They did not, then they did, then they didnt again. 
---
There have been a lot of changes thru the years. The most recent change removed JB fatigue when they went to new structueres
---
Fuck uncertainty I should be able to log on and  rat anytime I want this so called event is bullshit and fuck these pubbies like you for supporting it
---
As we speak right now several members of my gank squad are creating VPNs and **multiple** alpha accounts to gank newbie systems to make CCP pay for ruining the only good content in this game
---
please do it
---
Fuckin drifters. Everyone "thanks they are soo nice" me: shall i go ratting - nah dont wann lose my ship to overpowered npc... The end
---
I wouldn't consider a blatant "fuck you" broken mechanic to their paid subscribers then describing said subscribers as "entitled".
---
give bs boni for medium and small weapons, too. you'd see some funky builds if your ship had "energy weapons" instead of "large energy weapons". people could then build specialized fits and actually surprise their opponent.
---
More like Flagstaff.

Lol calling that sabre "active tanked" is almost as big of a joke as Pax Sex's solo pvp mentality when all he really does is pick matchups that he KNOWS he's gonna win. He uses nothing but the cheesiest of ships such as the breacher and punisher who are too strong for T1 ships imo,then overwhelms anyone who doesn't know about them and bam ez killmails.
---
This is definitely reflected in your work! Thank you!
---
In addition to what CMvan46 says, in lowsec you'll sometimes find smartbombing camps waiting to catch smaller ships and pods. 
---
90% of them will sit in line with the most heavily traveled route, so bouncing in from a different angle, from a planet, poco, citadel or something will mean you have a better chance of avoiding a fiery death.
---
CCP is a bot.
---
Oh man, do you remember when you could have multiple JB in a system and when they had 12ly range? You could burn straight from deklin to delve in a half hour without taking a real gate. 
---
Yes they removed jump fatigue on the most recent change, but id say the current JB is more vulnerable because it requires a citadel gunner to be at the ready. You can still bubble and catch travellers and shit. 
---
Not sure why they removed fatigue from JBs
---
Had to check to see if you had the police skin on.
---
:) some fights i do gotta police bleak lands init no illegal amarrs allowed
---
For those with poor reading comprehension skills:
---
&gt; ... had fun popping the HK structures.
---
The HK structures were in jspace, where they drop loot. With me so far? Let me know if you need to take a break, this is tricky stuff!
---
&gt; Maybe we need more of that in NS?
---
Nullsec is where structures do not currently drop loot (except for stuff in corp hangars, IIRC). Still with me? Okay, here's the real tricky part, "maybe we need more of that" is suggesting a mechanic change.
---
Shipfu yessssss
---
Lol okay dude.
---
No such thing as WRONG logi!
---
add ultima online's IDOC system, complete with free for all looting of all those cans in space when the structure collapses.
---
also add wear and tear to all structures.. they continuously lose hitpoints and can only be repaired x times, then have to be replaced.
---
that'd be a workload that keeps people busy and prevents spam and over-fortification of whole regions.
---
I just dont get your thinking, maybe Im missing something, could be 5 beers I've had.  The people who who use real money to buy plex are going to do that no matter what; its a relative fixed income that will not change regardless of how many players want to buy Plex with ISK.  Some of that plex goes to the Eve Store for skins and what not, and the rest goes to the market to purchase ISK to fund their ship and module purchases; no one would buy plex with real money to sub an account, that would be fuqing stupid.  So if there is not enough Plex on the market or the price is too high, or you just cannot afford it this moth your not going to go Omega, so how does CCP profit from Plexed accounts.
---
CCP finally nerfing afk nullsec anomalies, loving the salt.
---
That Caps can take them AND have no jump fatigue doesn't sound minor at all to me.  It means we will be back to the days of infinite power projection, only this time with MOAR CAPS and MOAR titans than before.
---
hop in a wormhole!
---
So you mean to tell me that 0.0 space is....finally....dangerous???
---
Not jita, but in actual market value were #2, just barely beating amarr last I’ve seen
---
&gt;esiJS is a updated library for EVE Online, that's updated and simple to use!
---
Could use a more detailed description of your library.  The above doesn't say anything about it.
---
Gima did it first. Code are cheap knockoffs. Like Pepsi is of coke
---
so what you're saying is that I can just farm incursions instead
---
So that alpha doesn't change at all in this situation, regardless of heat, given that it's the ROF that decreases with heat - but I see your point about it taking time, which is part of the reason for having these ships have some of the lowest tank in their classes (and a number of other intentional deficiencies).
---
As for damage effectiveness, the ranges are intended to dictate a lot here - with max DPS ammo on the battleship, you're only shooting at mid-blaster range, with generally lower tracking.
---
The DPS when overheating is obviously the biggest concern, but the weapons themselves also have a heat damage on the higher end for turrets, and the ship has no reduction to heat damage (instead electing to  make it a bit faster to repair them) - making that something you can't sustain for any significant amount of time.
---
The DD is a whole other beast, and I'll be the first to say that there's little that can be done to balance it that can cancel out the amount of damage it can do - but in this case, it gets extremely low tracking, needs you to already be damaged to activate, the significant warp delay afterwards, and the complete inability to cast or receive any forms of remote reps while it's fitted to your ship do about all I can think of to scale it back.
---
Just to say, this response isn't supposed to come off as aggressive defense - I think Drifter ships in any fashion like how they operate ingame rn would have a whole slew of balance issues to consider. The intent of the post linked was to try and create Drifter player ships that could limitedly match the NPCs in some areas with specific fits and circumstances, which obviously can lend to them being out of scale in some areas ;P 
---
That said, thanks for the criticism - always good to see what issues come with any design
---
They pronounce it Ver-sails too...
---
What does a citadel gunner have to do with the fact that anything on it can just reapproach and jump back, meaning there is literally no point in sitting and pvping on them at all.
---
Localizing their economies? So letting everyone else make insane money? I doubt that will last long.
---
Only an idiots doesn't take flair at face value.
---
I got Dark Souls Remastered for $5 last week. Slogging through Blighttown is better than Eve Summer 2019.
---
true, ive never been good at descriptions @w@
---
non-npc null should lose the rats and just be mining area, with some small incursions by pirate gangs like angels. this would solve a LOT of problems.
---
What is the second module row down, third module over on that fit?
---
No, because then plex demand will go down, and people will buy less of it. You are operating from a flawed premise that the amount of plex bought remains constant, and does not fluctuate with demand.
---
Im never afk while ratting so whats ur reason here?  Ever ratted with a carrier? Thats 10000 times more work than protected by concord afk miner in high
---
I just came back to the game recently, now I regret this decision. I have no incentive to do anything other than log in for stratops now. No making money or any other solo activity, because I don't want to risk being the lucky winner of instantaneous, zero-counterplay death by overpowered NPCs.
---
This state of affairs is not something that I was expecting when I decided to return, and I have little investment or incentive to continue now that I'm faced with the choice between pulling the slot machine lever on if I'm going to get CCP'd when I go out to try and make a bit of ISK to keep my PvP ships stocked.
---
Sure, EvE being a dangerous game is great and all, but dangerous because of other players, not because of fucking AI bots.
---
Broadly speaking, nullsec (and wormhole) ratting activities should be profitable even if you do get OP oneshot occasionally. I'm not going to try to pick a specific level of profitability, but part of the tradeoff is that setup work *and risk* should increase profitability. Nullsec ratting feels necessary because it's been OP for too long, as both work and risk plummeted while rewards stayed (relatively) high. I would obviously prefer that CCP introduce mechanics to allow other players to be the significant risk factor over having NPCs do it, but I'm happy to see them experimenting.
---
Right cuz spam is even close to camping. Sure 
---
I mean I ignore the whole thing and play in wh space so hardly matters to me. Still an iritating mechanic either way.
---
Dude, go back another decade.  2005-2009 is what I consider the "golden age".
---
Null was already going to shit in 2013-2014.
---
Also, 2013-2014 != "always been" on a game launched in 2003.
---
They're being nice and helping the VNIs adjust before the Nerf hits
---
danke.
---
Personally, as the host, I know that as I didn't play at the time I can't really say a whole lot. But I don't believe that a system designed by CSM being biased against a bloc that a CSM member didn't like is necessarily tinfoil. You could make the argument that it's far fetched, and I didn't ask him how he knew that it was designed by the csm, nor did I find out if it was, but if it is, that doesn't sound tinfoil at all.  
---
in addition/relatedly, I know a lot of people who think dominion was shit, and playing at the time that there were only 3 serious blocs (if I remember correctly, been awhile :P) and it kinda had to go. but that's not really he tinfoil you were talking about
---
A black ops, the less effective in almost every single category dread for the same cost? Good idea!!
---
His black ops argument was pretty funny though.
---
Originally CCP said they were allowing supers to take them. All the old iteration of JBs needed was a fatigue reduction cost, instead we have some game breaking cancer structures.
---
wrd, thanks!
---
Most plex is not bought to use it in the skin store. Most plex is bought to liquidate it, for a quick fix of isk. If nobody plexed their account, people would buy less plex because it isn't worth as much. Many players who do plex their accounts are from poorer regions, where $10 a month is a big amount, or they simply make enough ISK so they don't have to spend money. CCP profits because these people pay more by proxy.
---
Is that why everyone is crying about them? 
---
Now it seems they've fixed one of the issues players were complaining about initially; they warp to anoms to kill ratters.
---
Every choice has an associated risk vs reward. They've just adjusted it back to where it needs to be in null
---
I upvote but fuck it is so sad...
---
At least you can't AFK/Bot those though
---
Not sure if serious
---
Nullsec is the safest place in the game at the moment.
---
F in fleet boys. Tonight we drink in honor of the bean
---
I am , is mostly death and a waste of time... :sad_face:
---
Yes CCP, keep up the good work.
---
&gt; people will do stuff they enjoy even less than ratting. 
---
I have a theory about that, actually. From everything that I've heard, (VNI-style) ratting has the characteristics of moderate reward, low isk/sp investment, low effort, low risk, low day-of setup effort, low long term setup effort, low player skill requirement, and low fun. That's a lot of "low" in the negatives columns, offset by "low fun" and "moderate reward". And the low fun can be mitigated by doing other things while you rat due to the low effort required. I'm less familiar with carrier or super ratting, but my guess is that reward goes up and isk/sp investment goes up, and otherwise nothing changes.
---
So it's possible that you're right, but it's also plausible that people will start to gravitate toward activities that are higher fun, because previously it was hard to justify those activities against ratting when the "fun" factor was previously the *only* bad thing about ratting.
---
That would be a doomsday.
---
Gave me eye cancer, please, never post again.
---
I thought so. What am I missing here or am I jusy stupid
---
Imagine thinking anybody is gonna miss AFK nullbears
---
Good lord, **multiple** accounts??????
---
noice
---
Added to this, a reset won't achieve much as the seeds of thought are already planted in player's minds ... they will rebuild the server in what it is today in under 1yr.
---
It would in fact be a new gold rush.
---
LOL
---
Love the comet woop woop.
---
Grammar police says "rather WELL".
---
Yes!  Paying the Danegeld always gets rid of the Dane!
---
I think its just an overlay he puts on.
---
It's basically what is currently done in WH space. Just look around for low power structures that might have loot and bash them. If abandoned loot piñatas were everywhere they'd be cleaned up in no time.
---
To add to this.
---
Sub drops with amount you purchase, a 12month sub is 11 euros / month.
---
When you plex, there is no such discount, 500 PLEX / month, which is 20 euros, 17.5 euros / 500 plex if you buy 100 euros worth of plex (2860 plex).
---
As long as ppl are willing to buy plex with ingame assets, CCP will always make more money through ppl plexing their accounts.
---
This doesn't even take into account the microtransactions which bring in quite a lot of income.
---
Nope sorry. Another mechanic that would be easily abused to make Null safer. Big blocs would have these down in less than a day and could go back to krabbing risk-free
---
Didn't BoB start the mega coalition thing back in like 05-07?
---
Never said most plex is bought to spend in store, I said some is, and some is sold for plex.  My point in all of this, which I think has been lost, is that if the ability to earn the ISK to buy the Plex is made harder, as is the case now with drifters hitting ratters, then those that Plex accounts will have a choice to make, grind more or Sub with cash.
---
&gt;have you heard of buying Plex with ISK
---
And where did that plex come from, did it just appear out of thin air when you waved isk at it?
---
No, you bought it from another player. The only source of plex is a player giving money to CCP. If you buy it afterwards with isk from them, the plex still came from CCP being paid.
---
[this is how](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c8pf4b/the_endgame_of_nullsec_2019/esp8hyh?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Once you start going omega, you don't stop being Omega (in general).
---
I feel like moons should deplete of resources. Make ore Anom’s  pop up the way that wormholes do. You have to either probe them so you can warp to them or combat probe the ships within them.  And just like how in a worm hole you may not have a highest out for a week or so.... you may not get an anom for a a few days, maybe a week, maybe 1 day.  So don’t just spread the anoms out but make their spawns kinda RNG-ish and intermittent.
---
Many thanks for your post. It will help many in avoiding the potential dangers of the invasion.
---
Masochism
---
Sure, but CCP doesn't want that to happen, as every account that goes into or stays in omega using plex instead of a sub makes them $6 more at the minimum.
---
You do realize pvpers need to make ISK too and usually do so via pve methods?
---
She was flipped by Aryth...
---
This is always a concern using a MTU, and you died to rats all in your own, nothing new, empty your stuff more frequently.
---
Tl;dr hi-sec pubbie tastes what null people have been complaining, and come to reddit to complain
---
I think he was making a Bugs Bunny reference.
---
Custom painted a bicycle and added the Guristas emblem on the front.
---
Hyyyyyyyype !
---
EvE is really in a sad state when this kind of stuff starts popping up.  I have to agree though, this is one of the few ways left to get small gang fights.  Won't be long before this server goes the way of Serenity.  CCP is too slow on the draw to actually do anything that could change this in time.  Until then I will enjoy wormhole life and pop out and piss off some nullbears every now and then.
---
Again, you ignore my question.  Even if it's a minor nerf, forcing me to haul fuel into my hole is still a nerf on my playstyle.  Why should null carebear's playstyle be more important than mine?
---
Honestly, I doubt this will bring about any real change. But it's been a lot of fun watching krabs panic and complain about it.
---
it's semi afk and more isk
---
Unfortunately, you are correct.  Star Citizen has more content than eve these days.
---
That and trying to pvp on them gets your little fun fleet blasted by the citadel you aren't prepared to fight.
---
&gt; Your 2FA should be on your phone
---
This is also something i don't get at all. You complain a password database (and its key to decrypt) aren't safe. So instead, go put it in one of the items you are most likely to either lose or have stolen from you. Seems safe and totally not a good way to get locked out of your own access.
---
Now line members have access to the moons and can mine it themselves and either use it or sell it. It is a major reason that the average GSF member is so rich.
---
Then come and visit me, ill proove you wrong
---
and amarr has like what? 1/4 of jita?   its impressive but nowhere close "ours is better anyways"
---
Hmm, not many jumped to cyno. They go off to war and forgot how to properly blob.
---
Yes, but luckily for Eve a defector brought down that empire before it could grow to the size of the coalitions we have now. 
---
Maybe Eve was always destined to go this path, but BoBs death allowed it to prosper for a little while longer as a space where anyone could carve out their own small little piece of space.
---
haha cool
---
Lol yes you retard I know how to fit ships my point is a small increase can have a big effect even with stacking penalties
---
Hi, I dont fuck with citadels, can you explain to me what lifeblood did? thanks
---
I'm surprised Inner Hell let us catch them, they are slippery as shit
---
You can still do that, just keep an eye on your overview
---
So trigs and driftybois warping to annoms now. What I'm wondering is the new trig behaviour a bug because they fucked with drifter behaviour and they share the same AI ?? or is everything working as intended.
---
BUT HOW CAN WE DO THIS WHEN THE DRIFTER ARE KILLING ALL OF OUR STRUCTURES
---
Everyone cheats in every game online, the thing is EVE would have alot more cheating since the risks and real money involved is much higher, you don't see much cheating in rocket league, but if you ever played COD you know there is no reason and yet every single match aimbots. EVE is filled with cheaters, hackers scammers.
---
Oh shit wormholers get the avatars!
---
Oh look supercaps in delve.
---
You can't get up to go take a piss anytime you want, and you'll lose a lot more ISK if you don't pay attention. 
---
Still no botting though, and that's a big plus
---
Is it still the case that accounts which have 1 strike for botting get extractor-locked? IIRC they're also barred from transferring characters as well.
---
If so, this is something of a perverse incentive (Although admittedly the effort involved in getting CCP to actually take action for mere botting makes it a rather hypothetical one.) and also demonstrates that the capability is there.
---
Remote sebod by a ewar cruiser/frig?
---
The DD would be abused so hard. Whats to stop a fleet of these shooting themselves to activate DD then alpha'ing a super?
---
Not to mention the ganking potential in hs, how's the overshield going to work with concord?
---
Is there a guide / breakdown / wiki anywhere to the invasion sites and the invasion in general, I haven’t done pve in a long time but if it’s challenging and random I wouldn’t mind trying. 
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question, I’ve been out the loop.
---
You must be new here..there are a lot of idiots.
---
\-Goons blob a small cruiser gang roaming in null with 2x the number of supers
---
\-In other breaking news, water is found to be wet.
---
well they lock and scram the second you are in range and you can't see them coming on dscan, so yeah its insta death.
---
Inner Hell feeding a whole loki fleet. I can feel the unhappy from here. Bet the exit hole was rolled before the pods got back.
---
Keep it up!
---
Clearly you don't appreciate just how much this revitalises EVE. I expect we'll hear a lot more about it when they start spawning in hisec missions too.
---
Honestly just get rid of automatic asset safety on citadel destruction. It's a feature that makes sense if you want to exfiltrate goods from a running structure you no longer have access to, but at no other time.
---
If something as big and powerful as a citadel literally drops nothing upon destruction, how can you expect anyone to be motivated to bash it? Player made stations are a very interesting addition to the game but they've lost too many of the risks and features of the old POS system.
---
Make citadels drop their contents when destroyed, in addition to salvage worth a significant fraction of the price of the structure. Instead of timers, let them have at least some automated defenses like a POS.
---
&gt;Nullsec is the safest place in the game 
---
Citation needed. What are the stats?
---
This would be so good.
---
Good luck with that
---
There's always NPC stations if you're that worried about loss.
---
Mach is my favorite ship but the nightmare can also be a hell of a lot of fun.
---
Well, I for one am fully erect.
---
Comment below if you want their skill books to drop in wormhole space only. 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
This whole article is just whining. It's pretty funny to read.
---
&gt;a coordinated effort that requires dozens of TEST Alliance pilots working at all hours to protect their space
---
That must be hard for an alliance with like 20k charaters.
---
Stupid, I did the same back in 2011, it was a 2004 character..
---
They got tackled by a harpy fleet when somebody MJD'd them off the wormhole and while a chunk of their fleet was scrammed by interceptors. Then the hammer came in.
---
There are some details I think I didn't make clear enough - like the DD would ideally be banned in HS, and there's nothing that can actually replenish the overshield hp - it stays gone until the timer runs down, and the module can't be unfitted or anything like that until it does.
---
I don't think there's a good way to mechanically balance a thing like this in EVE - the only way I can think of to make it better might be to make the ammo for it very hard to obtain, resource-hungry for production, or otherwise limited - making it a really expensive undertaking to do what you suggested and alpha supers.
---
prepare your smart battleships bois, the bot plague will reskill to lvl4 couriers :D
---
This is an awesome idea. It's a shame CCP won't do it.
---
Wait a minute, based on other Reddit posts I thought you were always sitting undocked with your capital umbrella so you can drop on the nano cruiser gang that just came looking for "gudfights".  To hear them tell it cynos and caps are the only thing holding them back from filling up their killboard...cough, sorry, holding back EVE from a wonderful new era of super fun times.
---
Now I don't understand what you're talking about. Fozzie sov had it's entrails pulled out? Players mocked it? They were mad because its fucking tedious as all hell, so I guess you could call that mocking? Either way it has been around for quite a while now whike barely being touched by CCP, so there isn't really an excuse there.
---
huh? I was saying you could jump a Battleship around by using a Black Ops ship.
---
In what world is a Black Ops ship the same cost as a Dread? Unless you're blinging the **** out of it they're not very expensive.
---
Drag bubble them when they warp to/from the JB
---
I got you covered my dude: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/17dhhb/could_anyone_explain_like_im_five_what_eve_is_i/c84ws5i/
---
Who the FUCK are you, imposter?
---
lol what are you talking about? Caps are a great deterrent, ya, but they're not infinitely usable. They don't fill a lot of roles...they're decisively less normally-useful than just about any subcap in the game.
---
being caught out of position in a ab fleet, oof
---
And how do you propose punishing bots more than players?
---
I forgot the /s
---
As bad as i know windows is this is not a microsoft issue it's a ccp issue.
---
The weird part is Inner Hell stayed long enough to get caught. Usually they're smart enough to know when to get out.
---
Honestly, I’d love to see some sort of w-space Drifter invasions be the primary way to get this stuff~
---
This only started a week ago, kind of stopped and started again today with different AI behaviour. So it's not even possible for someone to make a guide.

Only respect if this is an attempt to sell more Skill Point injectors. You shill.

Oh no, making a simple, low risk activity require some skill in EVE, how EVER will people survive
---
Look at a blops and a dread post insurance before you put your foot any further in your mouth.
---
Maybe they were hoping the Drifters would show up :-D
---
aha! Thanks Jay!
---
Yes, so revitalizing to be the unlucky fuck not ratting in a supercarrier who gets unfortunate enough to have drifters spawn in your anom with capital DPS, frigate tracking, and 100km point. Getting nuked off the field without any ability to do anything about it. No warning, no D-Scan, no local, just CCP saying "hah, you won the loser lotto so now your asset gets deleted, better luck next time."
---
I can surely see how this will "revitalize" the game when people stop playing it when they can't undock without having to worry about CCP's AI coming to inflict anal prolapse on any ship they have that isn't a supercapital. Better buy more plex and skill injectors, because carriers and below are now fucking useless for ratting.
---
Where are my T2 battleships?
---
Lol “we blobbed some Lokis with supers”. The bar must be pretty damned low these days.

You lost me at “tackled”

Eve is a containment zone, not a videogame.

I don’t get it!. Over at Sc it has been promised that from the very beginning, Aliens, Slavers, the military, NPC even freaking space weather could disrupt the Status Quo of an Area.

Wormholes are your salvation. Can't afk our rats. Not many of you nullbears can say you own several systems to yourself too. I'm super rich, super chad and I laugh when you guys debate over which ships have the best ticks. I get the dankest pvp, travel all of new eden and have the blingest doctrine ships. Most of you have leadership that never plays and give you guys retarded rules like having blues. Thank Bob I'm no e-cuck.
---
Thanks for asking!
---
Well, I won't speak ill of our allies.... BUT... we're probably the most community oriented corporation in Goonswarm. I've been around the block and never have I come across a corp as social as ChemiKals is. We can offer all the same things other Goon corps can, but one thing that really sets us apart is that strong sense of community. We're all good friends, many of us know each other IRL because of the game and we help each other out in whatever ways we can... whether that be in-game or IRL.
---
I'm not even 15 seconds in and the music has me amped up. Nice going.
---
haha thanks, message received ;P
---
lol yeah people think carrier ratting is just "warp to anom, drop drones and turn on netflix."
---
No, you gotta keep your fighters moving at all times or you'll start losing them, and they cost several million a pop. Constant micro-management to keep fighters on a target. Get distracted for a few seconds and a rat ship popped so your fighter wing is now sitting there at 0 m/s? Woops you just lost a fighter or 2 and now the last 10 minutes of ratting income is nullified by the cost to replace them.
---
take a piss between sites, watch some youtube on a different monitor, etc. It's better isk for slightly more effort.
---
What is the # of players you think a system should be able to hold? How do you measure that? How do you control how many people are in a system?   
---
People have been grouping together en masse since.... well forever. I'm not sure this is going to change anything.
---
It’s because brave newbies is good for the game. Where goons are not.
---
After TCP collapsing and SMA losing its core of pvp players QFC will be down to three members.
---
You do realize Drifters lock and scram instantly?
---
I assume CCP updated drifter's AI to make them capable of warping to anomaly, and forgot invasion triglavian is using the same code
---
So help me out here cause I'm not as well versed in the entire 0.0.... thing. If Delve is such a pain with the Super drops, just don't go there? Aren't there dozens of other regions? I'm not saying this to be a jerk or anything, why aren't these other regions potenial hunting sights?
---
They had no business getting tackled the way they did. That was Inner Hell having a brain fart.

Exactly. I'm convinced all of nullsec active player base could fit into a single region as things are now. There are 40 regions. And even we had 1,000,000 active players in nullsec to fill the space and utilize the ridiculous amount of resources CCP put in each region, war still sucks right now. There is nothing to be gained except more resources no one needs. CCP fucked up royale with citadels. There's just so much broken in null right now.
---
Right but this is why it's called TWO factor authentication. You need both parts in order to log in. Also a phone-based OATH-TOTP authenticator is probably one of the most secure methods since you're likely to have a pin/fingerprint lock on it and it's impossible to intercept codes e.g. via SMS.
---
because in Delve we have just as many idiots to feed
---
It's like being stuck in a time loop.
---
This is a fake BR. I've been informed by many knowledgeable reddit posters that going to someone else's space is now impossible because of drifters.
---
Looking forward ro the trit spike!
---
Are these ones magically invisible from dscan
---
Ha. It's like being stuck in a time loop.
---
it's passwords all the way down
---
*laughs in Canadian rye*
---
or let people play how the fuck they want carebear.
---
o7 fellow capsuleer, may you continue your endless journey on the other side of the EvE Gate.
---
Because Delve is not that far out of the norm, like if it was just delve it would be a minor issue the reality is that most regions that have active folks behave exactly the same in terms of super drops.
---
How do you adapt to getting bad RNG and having your ship deleted without warning? Not play the game? Looks like that's the only choice.
---
Nullsec groups will take literally anything with or without a pulse these days.  
---
Look at me  
---
You are the pubbies now
---
Yes, and that’s why your point is wrong
---
Goon content is Cancer.

Player: "FC I forgot how to use doomsday."  
---
FC: "Don't worry we got 20 more."
---
That fit deserved to die a horrible dead.
---
Maybe a Dev scanned your fit and manually sent the Triglavians to do it?
---
Video games journalist doesn't know how to play games and is massively disingenuous. News at 11.
---
like cool and all, but is this rly something to brag about
---
Maybe I don't scour the reddits here as much as others but I rarely if ever see people complain about another groups super umbrella. 
---
If every (or most) other groups have super umbrellas and cram all their guys under it, why is everyone on goons case over it? And if everyone has super umbrellas, who is complaining? People in npc null? Low sec?
---
2 days ago, I ran into the same fleet outside of any conduit (random asteroid belt) in addition to another spawn ( or 2) of the normal frigates in a system rated as adjacent. The anchoring frigate(s) caught me by surprise and when combined with my bastion module failing to disengage (despite visual confirmation), resulted in a nasty ship loss. Got the ship and modules comped, but never asked if it was because my module problem or that this particular OP fleet had jumped the gun in being present at that time. Never saw a fleet made up like that outside a conduit for the 48 hours after. Going on today's increased Invasion ship loss, this has been a nasty surprise to a lot of players.
---
That's why I keep poking on it.
---
Where you see this? Afaik, drifters have basically not been posted about by ccp
---
Oh, the humanity
---
Lebowski's tweet
---
It's only 3.6 roetgens comrade

Here come the police :)
---
I'm in Tampa and would love to meet up with some fellow space nerds over beer.
---
That's one way to combat botting.
---
Cheers man will always do :)
---
if you check the zkillboard timestamps, they all pretty much died between :47 and :49 - looks more like they got caught travelling, not a fight going bad
---
This has nothing to do with skill.
---
It’s funny localizing an economy in Eve lowers efficiency
---
First Class, Second Class, No Class
---
Noter Dayme 😂
---
Two things:
---
Who cares about post-insurance. I never factor "insurance" into the cost of a ship. I don't plan on them ever blowing up. It's fine that you do, but the insurance on Blops ships is broken, and everyone knows that. It has nothing to do with the ship cost.
---
Even aside from that -- a fully-fitted Dread is in the neighborhood of 3.5-4b. A fully-fitted T2 Blops is 1.5-2b. We're literally talking about half the price. That's apart from the fact that you **don't need to fully fit**. You can buy a hull for 1b and throw a few covert modules on it and call it a day (so 1.1b). Yes, that's expensive for basically a jump ship, but that's not the point.
---
Picking fights and right ship, also theorycrafting is one of most important thing in EVE pvp.
---
What he does on his vid is quite simple; he utilizes his lowsec style AB fit, against nullsec MWD fit, at null, which is hard to expect.
---
If you’re gonna call it cheese tatics, maybe it’s right. But all l33t pvp is kinda cheese and neutralize enemy with some way, for example kiting, so It’s dumb to be salty about this.
---
likewhoquestionmark
---
uhhh, you know that SMS is dis-recommended precisely because it can be intercepted, right?
---
https://www.onespan.com/blog/sms-authentication
---
&gt;It's a feature that makes sense if you want to exfiltrate goods from a running structure you no longer have access to, but at no other time.
---
It's feature parity with conquerable stations and outposts.
---
"Asset Safety" was "remotely create a courier and/or firesale contract".
---
Who knew that CCP doing their own Monkeysphere with NPCs in 2019 would be seen as being great for the game...
---
Drifters killing AFK bots is all well and good, but the same Drifters won't discriminate and will turn up to gib some poor schlub who is geared up to fight whatever NPCs they're expecting to fight and not insta-lock, scram, neut gib factories.
---
It's been said already but if you just make PvE treacherous far beyond the point where there's any reasonable risk/reward consideration, then those people will just not play, or do something else where Drifters aren't involved. Either way, in a symbiotic system, the effects will be felt beyond the directly affected.
---
Are y'all bragging about killing a 40 man roaming gang with several hundred dudes?
---
at some point someone is going to have to explain how having passwords saved in a digital format is more secure than not
---
maybe I'm just dumb but isn't introducing another point of failure just worse
---
Wormhole space really is what null should have been.
---
No local, no Intel, lawless Mad Max style. Instead it's been perverted into something over time. And we've only got CCP and ourselves to blame.
---
I've tried having this discussion but there is no point lol. They will just tell you to adapt or go along the lines of "Drifters? Sounds like wormholes to me so stop crying"
---
CCP Ghostrider
---
Goons are very symbolic of the problem, because of the volume of ratters they have out in space, there the group that does it with the highest number of dudes.
---
The reality is the people complaining consists of a whole bunch of people: 
---
From high sec to wormhole space to some null blocs that are either hypothetical or prefer it not to be the optimal way to play ( as it leads to shit game play ) along with people that just plain quit the game.
---
Yar I always refer to him as his Twitter handle for some weird reason. Great person to engage with.
---
So many asinine things here. But I think the worst of them is the last part - did you just say that you think you can use a blops to bridge a t1 BS? Lololol
---
By being part of the problem, not the solution.
---
Because instant-death NPCs that have no counter is not terribly fun gameplay.  In any game.
---
How many passwords do you have? Because I have triple digits.
---
Now, I could have simple passwords, and be able to remember them, or I could have complex passwords, and store them in my password safe.
---
If my computer is compromised, I'm fucked either way. (key logger, for example)
---
The funny part is, even given the overwheling sentiment it's broken and needs changes to keep the game healthy. CCP in their infinite laziness will respond 3 years too late.
---
Being a "reporter" for a PC Game "Magazine" is a career?
---
It also prevents shoulder surfing, if you work in a field where you're on call at times and you're traveling having a password which automatically filled without revealing the characters or what's being typed.
---
2.5 2much for them
---
You don't have time, they insta lock
---
Well, only like 500 of those characters have gunnery rights to anything bigger then an astra most likely.
---
Having everyone in supers? I see that as a win too titan ratting should be the meta
---
https://keepass.info/ is free though
---
because ccp's imbalance team members are highly skilled professionals
---
Stainguy is still a better poster
---
we are declaring war on nighsec miners instead of figthing eachother. Braindead logic.
---
Yep so is lastpass any can be used I just put 1pass because discount I personally roll lastpass. :) I just wanted to spread the word and hopefully get people away from reusing passwords / variations of the same one.
---
One year later: "omg it's such bullshit that goons control 3/4 of 0.0 we need more space CCP"
---
What skill? Fly a super or above to rat simple as that because what this game needs is more supers.  That's literally what your asking for
---
Because of supercapital proliferation.
---
Players don't care as much if they lose a hic or a hac. BS are effectively ammo.
---
Throw supers in the mix and 99% of the time no player wants to risk them unless their side has an overwhelming advantage. Because it's on a killboard. The game is geared towards public shaming for massive losses and the majority of players flying their giant space sticks when it's safe to do so.
---
So far in all my fights against provi I think spectre was in 1.  Most the time it's just us spanking Provi against the odds.  But what do I know I am a lowly line member.
---
He publicly goes by the name :D So no problem there.
---
Here's the TL/DR version of it.   
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XvpHVCp2oU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XvpHVCp2oU)
---
presumably he means the time between when they appear on grid and exit warp, but that is a short window to notice and warp, particularly if you aren't pre aligned. I figure bots start being perma aligned if they weren't already with a trigger to warp when they see drifters on overview and this goes back to killing only players.
---
Oh really that's awesome, I hope to see him at a sec conf / talk in the future. I know he's doing NDC Sydney.
---
Reddit: stupid drifters don't even attack botters
---
Also reddit: stupid drifters now attacking botters
---
Only Geminate is left if you want to fight anything that isn't bots/a supercapital fleet
---
Fuck, the Drifters are now in Insmother too :-(
---
Yeah that is exactly what an entitled subscriber sounds like.  Go eat a bag of dicks.
---
nothing new...this evening they droped 20 supers with fax support on 20  man frig roaming gang...ccp fix ur shit...soon no1 gona left in game but goonz and pets...ahhh and bots
---
I agree with you this drifter saviour has shown us everyone must fly a super since they are the only ones that can rat! We need more supers and above in this game! Well said joifugi
---
they are massive pubbies.
---
Absolutely. Semi-AFK loot boxes or excuses for spicy dread actions and the risks that it involves would be great for PvP in lowsec.
---
Can't you just rat aligned though? Switch celestials occasionally to stay in range and/or keep transversal.
---
BOB was considered large at the time. Not even a blip on the radar compared to the mega coalitions in the game currently.
---
Astra inclinant, sed non obligant
---
The idea behind password manager is not only to store passwords for you, but mainly to allow you to use different unrelated passwords - each unique for one service. In practice, personal password sets are rarely worth the time and effort to attack if they're at least somewhat secured - mainly because criminals can make only so much money off you. On the other hand, trying to attack various online services and applications is much more profitable - because then it allows attackers to get whole list of passwords paired with other data (logins, emails etc.) and automate trying those out on unrelated services. By having unique password the danger related to it is diminished, because even if someone gets your email and your password to service X, they can't use it (or guess, if you're using some kind of pattern for passwords) your password to your mailbox, bank account, Facebook or anything else.
---
As an example, let's say there's a website hipjumpdestinations.inyour.space where you registered with email and a password "JumpsBadPassword2019!". The service just happens to have a bug/security flaw and both your email and this password gets leaked. Now, if your email password is also "JumpsBadPassword2019!" or something easy to guess like "GmailBadPassword2019!", then say goodbye to anything connected to your email (your characters, skillpoints, assets, but also Google/Apple account, Amazon account - hope you didn't have payment info set, Paypal etc.). Yet, having password like "a?^'s5At#lca=gXxb'_JY5pP" to that service and "A0Gc*YTRx\=232r4Oz$&amp;6zlm" to your email means there's barely any correlation between those two, and this kind of leak you couldn't do anything about, doesn't pose highly increased risk to you.
---
Two-factor authentication serves similar and complementary role - to protect you from one security leak spreading to other services you use. And if you think about using some kind of "trash service password" for all those seemingly unreliable services, there are two caveats - one, you (and anybody, really) can't tell if seemingly trustworthy service won't be hacked, we've seen leaks from supposedly well secured service providers; two, getting this "trash password" still allows relatively easy access to your other services that use it - and then it's a question how many of those you need to either get access to any of the important ones (because of security questions, other access recovery options) or if getting this much won't be enough to allow someone to scam other people by impersonating you.
---
TL;DR: using password manager isn't about getting perfect security (it doesn't exist), it's mainly there so you aren't easy target for criminals using data leaks, as long as other targets provide better profit for effort, you're generally safe, and having unique unrelated passwords is big factor in that.
---
Still not enough time generally the point is on you before they actually land
---
Sorry this isn't any null bloc(s) we enjoy going out on drunk fleets we are moree likely to gank the frieghters (truck) moving the bourbon
---
Just with a little forgiveness for IRL issues. 4 to 8 weeks grace period and then loot box mode.
---
Make anomalies respawn somewhere in the same region.  Players will spread out on their own.
---
I'm just saying they started the idea. I was responding to a comment saying that idea is what started the slow death of eve, and 05-07 is probably about when "eve is dying" started getting thrown around commonly, so yeah things grow over time, but seems like it all fits.
---
The golden age died the day the goons showed up.  Grrrr goons 😂
---
yea you're preaching to the wrong one, I love what this is doing to the game.
---
Fair enough, was just pointing out.
---
go right ahead
---
The free ports one are because they let rando tether in "our" space (low-sec lol.) The athanors on decent moons are because they hog a moon and random neutral ones because you never know who's staging out of them and for what.
---
Correct...covert cyno, blops connects and jumps anything you need. 
---
Please tell me where you think I'm wrong.
---
or; nullsec is only logging in to good fite each other

The old post on reddit to authenticate my support ticket jobbie take my +1 but just remember........ We all know!
---
What is your alliance? If I may know.
---
Might as well just put ratting people, bot or not, on an invisible random timer and when the timer ends you explode. This is fucking retarded. What the fuck?
---
Look head a point everyone should just be in a super or above because what eve needs right now is more supers+ and since supers and Rorqs are the only think that can survive this new 'amazing' threat added to null,  supers for all! We'll soon be able to buy them off the store next to our SP packages yay!
---
NullSec Divas, masters of their craft.
---
Why. Why would you tell us this. How have I not ever noticed this?
---
Or quit playing.
---
This is quite literally how it's working at present.
---
This bad boi can fit so much corn in it
---
&gt;small
---
&gt;42 ships
---
Oh ok.
---
Yes.  Why not.  It's kind-of funny.
---
I wholly endorse everyone ratting in supers
---
Lmaoooo
---
So a random system has 10 sites from lowest to highest, let's just say. Once the players clear them, what happens? No more spawns that day? They respawn somewhere else and that system has 15? 20? 
---
Also how many people do you think should be in a system? "Spread out" is kinda vague.
---
Eve 2019, proud on blobbing subcaps with twice the number in supers. 
---
Fucking noob.
---
Basically if you enter null sec with anything other than a capital ship get 1 shot scrub Rorqs supers n titans only
---
Can you imagine someone grinding a Titan for several months and just finally pushing the button to build it. "Hey guys, we're resetting everything!" The player base is like 98% sunk cost fallacy at this point. Reset everything and that's gone and all the players are gone.
---
Not entirely true, fleets go to BWF all the time, you don’t see horde dropping supers on everything that moves
---
It's called adapting for the better good. It's done all the time. People just don't cry about it like you do. Besides, it's not even a real fix yet. Get a grip on yourself, boy.
---
yes there is and we are watching... you live in your little discord wannabe streamer echo chamber and cant see what you look like to the real players RPing in EVE Online. You think you are the RPing community... you are not the only people you have fooled is yourself and one or two CCP employees. sick, you have zero integrity and you self absorbent actions have hurt the game.
---
Someone translate to english please.
---
Got blapped in s abyss earlier. These drifter fucks are everywhere....
---
When compared to 240, yeah, that's small
---
They had over 5x the number of ships, many of them supers, just to deal with a roaming cruiser gang.
---
Brave will react the same as anyone else if you tackle our money makers: we'll drop (especially in Impass).
---
Bring what looks like a good fight, and we'll try to form and undock in what is a comparable good doctrine to counter it and have some good kills, which is what we try to make happen when people come in Catch. But you touch the money maker pockets in and around Impass, and the response will be as harsh as possible: it's just natural.
---
Yup, should be great for the game. Can't even be arsed to log in other than if a important fleet is pinged lol
---
Must have been a swelling sense of pride after that. Nicely done.
---
kk thanks
---
And they say goons cant tackle

If SP investment isn't an issue, just use a Leshak.

&gt; What do capital ships "do" that is so different?
---
Several multiples of DPS and tank more than the ship class just below them?
---
he asked for a fit not a idea...
---
Makes it a little hard when about 2/3 of the active playerbase bandwagons on to one coalition to be on the "winning team". It tends to make the rest of space just a little empty
---
Apparently you get 15-20 seconds to warp out.  Bot codes being updated guaranteed.
---
Shame...
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Doing something about citadel timers would be another.
---
0 timers. Always vulnerable.
---
Fixed.
---
Fastest Subwarp speed. So you can creep on grid a little sneakier and setup bookmarks while cloaked in less time.

See you out there! 7o

I’m also curious what sort of performance increase I could expect.

I think all 3 sabres in fleet shit out a bubble when we landed on them. The real hero is the boosher who got like 20 of them and the bubbles.

Actually, I'm curious to hear whether they're still hitting structures or if their latest evolution focuses only on players in space...
---
Unironically, I hate boson ratting but that's exactly what I'll end up doing if I actually decide to log back into EVE again.
---
Went ahead and made like half of it optional &amp; took some weapons systems out.
---
If your not super or above you get insta locked n killed so its not like you have an option
---
I think it's working as intended. CPP wanted to get rid of the predictable ratting behavior with the new NPC AI.
---
Oh hey, look, i fit a cyno on 6 of my dread alts. Damn. That was a hard work around.
---
&gt; in the same region
---
Nope, you should be able to chase them out of a region entirely by over farming, and cause more to spawn in regions that have few being killed - that way people either need way more space or end up doing their PVE in risker space outside their home area.
---
I like the rats more than I like Madcat
---
The best proper method is to keep access recovery codes in analog format - on a piece of paper or similar, put in secure location (safe etc.). The idea behind 2FA is to make it impossible to access your account after having full unrestricted access to one distinct thing (device/system) you use - both in cases of getting your hardware lost, getting malware, or having your network traffic intercepted and modified/decrypted. By putting your 2FA codes inside password manager along with passwords, access to those service is as secure as access to your password manager, which provides single point of failure, but more often than not is still much better than not having 2FA at all.
---
If I wanted that I'd move to a wormhole. You do you. I'll do me.
---
new vid ? :D
---
Basically they are pulling the attention away from the huge VNI nerf on top of all the recent nerfs
---
Every site is a ghost site CONFIRMED.
---
And most money making in general.
---
The economy is going to be fucked for a while after this.
---
90% cormorants, had to squint to find a VNI.
---
No. Most self proclaimed PVPers who "never pve" simply swipe their credit card. 
---
And if EVE was full of only those types, we would have no ships to fly.
---
Nice fight! I bet the logi's were pretty happy getting to field test what they literally just learned haha
---
inb4 tdsin FC BOMBS?!
---
Just seemed a little strange to me that so many corps would do this out of the goodness of their hearts. Like from what I’ve seen so far eve is pretty cutthroat
---
Please yes!
---
If I was running that drop I would have bridged in exactly 1 harpy with a cyno. How many russian doll harpies can you kill before you die?
---
Those corps make money by taxing the income you make while in the corp (among a few other ways). But yes, they generally give out free stuff, because they stuff they give out is chump change in comparison to the money they make.
---
Your mileage may vary, depending on the group you choose, but Horde and Brave are both pretty well-known and time-tested groups with lots of resources.
---
Drifter Battleship (and weapons) BPC ccpls!
---
Unironically, yes, it will help. Less cases of account access being stolen to reach security team means more time for them to deal with other issues.
---
Perma banning for botting.
---
A big boy in his big nullsec, scared of rats.
---
You change the way you play the game.  Your old ways will not work anymore.  So you have to find another way to do what you need to do.  Think out of the box.  Change your play style, your fit, your location, anything to not do what you have come to expect to.
---
Not true according to people in my alliance chat. Instant lock/scram/dead when they land on grid.
---
yeah reminds me of that. I luckily got reimbursed too.
---
All it takes is a quick peek at dotlan stats for 2018...
---
[http://puu.sh/DOksl/a41e5d7c02.png](http://puu.sh/DOksl/a41e5d7c02.png)

I got reimbursed, so probably a bug.
---
lmao, waiting on someone in rote to get something done?  
---
\&gt;&gt; will be a while boys
---
They need to unfuck the geddon. Dunno why they tried to turn it in to a cheap shit version of a bhaal. Who ever had that idea needs to be skinned alive. Oh how I miss the gankageddon.
---
a better analogy would someone following this one hit wonder band to every single club they play and then heckle them because they aren't playing their 'favorite song'
---
why is it so hard for you to just stop playing a game you dislike?
---
haha xD
---
Yes, print out your backup codes and TOTP Seed and then put them in your home safe.
---
Moons aren't really the problem as they are kinda finite, anoms just endlessly respawn.
---
This is why they changed the name of Sleepers on gates.
---
Having multiple different NPCs called the same thing with vastly different behaviors is a great way to confuse the average idiot.
---
These new drifters have frigate tracking so good luck trying to TD the fleet of 20 that lands on grid with no warning that can insta lock and scram you.
---
Not a very good friend if he didn’t give it to you (assuming you still play) instead.
---
is not ur fault mate..iss ccp milking dollars from players(inject rorqs)and leaving the game in a shite mode after dumping the game to koreeans
---
Well, do you know how banning works? Do you know how *finding a bot* works?
---
There is NO RULES on the drifters, there is nothing anyone can do once they spawn, not even warp out. Killing them requires a fleet and a lot of that fleet dies in the process. You can throw supers at them, but that's reactionary cause, they randomly spawn and then just as randomly despawn. Without any warning or pattern at all.
---
That bad boy can create so many loss mails.
---
First you must leave the wormhole.
---
yes, quite
---
Big blocks need new members to stay alive, so they make the newbro experience as good as they possibly can. 
---
In horde that means: free skillbooks, free ships, regular classes, experienced players tasked with helping new players settle in and answer their questions, regular fleets led by experienced krabs who know what they are doing, low sp fittings incorporated into all alliance fleet doctrines, players tasked with helping players participate in those fleets and more.
---
In  short, blocks regard new players as a valuable addition to the team and treat them as such.
---
I'm sure nobody is going to complain about killing some ratting supers
---
imagine a government that actually used tax revenue to fund social programmes.
---
well, that's how new player corps work in eve.
---
drifters were shooting a structure in 1dq1, today, after downtime.
---
To expand in this. There are a lot of people who will tell you how to have fun in the game. Just listen to what you enjoy, and enjoy the profits you make.

When I first started playing I did a lot of the early missions. And found I enjoyed the logistics of mining and refining ores. So I started skilling up the respective skills for those things. It was really enjoyable to go from holding less than 500M3 of ore, to 5000M3, to 27,500M3 of ore.
---
It was also enjoyable to learn which ships could be used safely in various security areas due to the pvp aspect of the game always being a factor. Other players would influence where I could mine safely, a lot of people can find this annoying. But honestly it really adds to the immersion, losing a ship was a really interesting experience that I’ve never had in any other game. It was sad and fun all at the same time. 
---
Just enjoy the experience. Enjoy the wins and losses equally, it’s all fun.
---
There are plenty of new bro scams, mentioning no names. Brave and pandemic horde are not scams. We have taxes and we need players to keep our sov, newbros provide both. 
---
Also, our newbro care pack is worth fuck all for an alliance our size. Most of the cost of a newBro is time spent training them but we have some people that are happy to do that it is not a problem.
---
There are some secrets (passwords?) that are supposed to be shared in relatively controlled manner with only certain people/family - think wifi password, Netflix family account access, ISP webpanel account access etc. - and for those having a way of sharing password that isn't sending them over some kind of IM or email (or keeping passwords so simple they can be dictionary-cracked) is always preferable.
---
But honestly... That still is fucking GLORYOUS!!! xD
---
They're legitimate. But realize that most Eve corps that are recruiting will be generous to new players. Hell, I've given ISK to new players I have just killed. 
---
Don't feel like you have to join a big alliance. There are great groups of all sizes. 
---
Check out r/evejobs for recruitment. There's also an in-game chat under corps. The official forums also have a recruitment section.
---
They key word being "selected" and "vaults"  
---
You can create a "Family" vault where you share the Netflix and Hulu password with your family members. You then keep your "EVE" password info in your personal vault.  
---
They aren't shared unless you decide to share them.
---
I think in modern journalism using the word "unprecedented" as much as possible is required.
---
Memy and then follow up with honest.
---
This! The embedded browser is running Chromium 65 if I remember correctly and doesn't have the U2F/WebAuthN APIs enabled.
---
SC is a pyramid scheme.
---
Capitals literally never needed sub caps as support, unless you for some reason think Archons with 400 sentry drones and 1000 lights required other, smaller ships to haze your small gang
---
If they're going to one shot you no matter what, why bother undocking a proper doctrine.
---
It is not recommended for high-security applications/systems. It's still perfectly fine for the average Joe, and certainly better than no 2FA at all.  
---
We'd very much like to skip that and go straight for U2F/WebAuthN though, but some technical debt needs to be cleared up first.
---
They probably did really well, trying to do things properly before they've learned any bad habits.
---
Vini, Vidi, Vici
---
don't lose your head
---
They were 3-5x more effective against subs than they are today, depending on what iteration you're talking about. But back then the total number of them was probably less than 5-10% of what it is today, so you didn't get them dropped on you unless you went where PL lived, and surprise, you would get supers and/or carriers dropped on you, literally every time.
---
Haha I'm pretty sure I scooped mine up. They probably put one down themselves to prevent any more shenanigans :D
---
This has held me back from joining a null sec new player group as well. I assume they subsidize the new player ships with taxes. It is not, in all honesty, not my main concern. I assume ships provided can let me participate in fleets in tackle of logistical roles. The worry is about the times fleets are not going and I should be making money for books and ships not provided?
---
When I am doing work (PVE) what is the situation? Wandering hunters are not a problem. I am concerned about the null version of people who camp these known new player areas and target new players. How do they use game mechanics to do so (they must be risk adverse). What are some known counters?
---
I know they exist because people are shitty. Maybe someone out there can tell us about them.
---
~~esiJS gud, axios requests everywhere bad~~
---
what do you need translated?
---
Veni, Vidi, Veni!
---
That seems like a pretty fixable problem...
---
So this should appease all those dudes asking for nullsec to spread out. It effectively means whatever system drifters are in are dead to PvE. Sounds like a win win.
---
But the obvious fix might install a small amount of risk for letting literally anyone into your alliance!
---
Like we tell miners, be aligned and dont be AFK ...
---
Or just a few more gunners :D
---
But that might let a 0.000000000001% chance one of those is a spai
---
stay aligned and pay attention, not AFK
---
This tells me you haven't actually encountered drifters. Your info is wrong.
---
 stay aligned and pay attention, not AFK
---
you got reimbursed because you fucked up?
---
Kill them all and let god sort it out.
---
I started EVE with an interest in the market and mining. It seemed exciting to me, and still is to some extent, but I remember thinking - hell, I ought to try this PvP thing everyone is so keen on, and so Teizo was born. I immediately enrolled him into FW, knowing next to nothing about the game, and decided to head to the most contested system nearby — Merco, which is where I met Sim.
---
We briefly fought as enemies, but soon after, and more importantly, we fought together as friends. I was there on coms when he decided to turn and fight against Conoco, the Corp. he invested so much of his time in. It was bewildering to everyone else who was there to hear it — to me, being new and not knowing the history and politics at play, I saw someone passionate about the game who was willing to go to any lengths to complete his goal — to put Nina IN THE BOX! It seemed rad me, and I was all-in.
---
I remember the battle over Merco as a long and arduous struggle full of quick intense skirmishes and long, super late-night oplex sessions, which Simetry never missed. Those were some of my fondest memories of him — along with a small group of friends, just shooting the shit, waiting for some plex-timers to run down, as we all stayed up well past our bedtimes. It was the most fun I’ve had in the game. 
---
I think he was misunderstood by most upon initial contact, I admittedly was no different, but I soon grew to understand his vibe. To me, he was a child at heart - kind and helpful, which was refreshing to encounter in this game. He was the protector of Placid, the scourge of Nina, and my friend. 
---
Goodbye, Simetry. 
---
They show up on dscan
---
You can D-Scan them.
---
That is because there was always far too much LP rewarded from missions that should never have been in FW to begin with. Now you are addicted to having that easy LP while not even doing any FW for it. You've had long enough to have milked that cash cow to have a sizeable nest egg saved up. I'd be more than happy for current militia LP to only be used in the current LP store and a new LP store to be opened with lower prices which only the new LP could be spent in. CCP just then needs to do their job and look to see if a new LP exploit is happening and insta-ban anyone doing it.  
---
So long as the LP needed for something, e.g. VNI, requires more ISK blown up than the cost of reward then it will stay a sink. i.e. you want a 10m worth implant then you need to have blown up ships (and mods) that cost 20-30m or something after platinum insurance payouts (and dropped mods/cargo). Means people CAN just blow up their alt to convert into LP items, but they'll be losing a LOT of ISK doing so. Would be cheaper and easier to just buy the item off the market from someone who got the LP from really doing FW.
---
yes i have, and the groups off them would wreck a super pretty fast for battle ship's, though they seem weaker  then the normal ones.
---
Special reminder for you that CCP is fighting a menace that has plagued every MMO always, that requires them to be 99.9% accurate in avoiding false positives, against an adversary that loses nothing when their caught and gains everything when they win all while having a legitimate player base that has made the news repeatedly for their efforts to undermine each other.
---
Why shoot them? They don't followup on timers.
---
I think im going to die soon from a sodium chloride overdose during the past week.
---
per aspera, ad nauseum
---
You going for a down vote speed run?
---
do they warp onto grid or just spawn like majic?
---
Yeah that’s a really good point I hadn’t thought of. I would assume people definitely do prey on what is a big population of new players who don’t know wtf they’re doing in these areas. I probably would lol.
---
If it's one of the major null entities, there are standing fleets dedicated to protecting ratters and miners. There is always going to be risk involved in doing PVE activities in any space, but you can take steps to reduce that risk by being in fleet and being on comms.
---
Horde provides mining and PvE ships to new players. As well there is what's called a "standing fleet" this is a fleet for people you are just hanging around the home region. If enemy players come into the region the standing fleet responds. If enemy players tackle you while you're out you call for help and standing fleet responds. Basically the corp members form our own version of CONCORD.
---
In my experience, you’re not really expected to do anything specific when there aren’t fleets, classes, or ops planned. You can spend your time doing whatever you want (and can afford) to do as long as you’re not making them look bad. 
---
I don’t think I fully understand your concern on the second point. 
---
If you are worried about campers in a system: I doubt you’ll have real trouble with people camping the staging area for your Corp. If anything, the camper will get chased off or proved down and killed. 
---
But it sounds like you might be more worried about someone exploiting the game? If this didn’t answer your question, please elaborate.
---
That's like the plot of every sci-fi movie. Students on a training mission get ambushed by real baddies. Well done.
---
Eh the economy is probably gonna be better now that they've slowed down the ISK faucet
---
False. You rat in a spot, you keep an eye on dscan and aligned to a safe spot, then if something bad warps in the second you see them you hit warp. I lived in a wormhole for a long time, this is literally drilled into me and it should be drilled into anyone who wants to play in low/nul/wormholes. 
---
All these big nulsec blobbers harassing highsec players about how they are carebears who need to grow balls and move out to low/nul but then cry when something potentially poses danger to their blue donut safe farms. It’s insanely hypocritical and pathetic, so excuse me if I have a hard time finding some sympathy for people who cry about how safe highsec is but then get triggered when suddenly rats are spicing the game up a little. 
---
Now, if the rats are also attacking newbies in .8+ space, that’s a little absurd and unnecessary. But rats that appear out of nowhere and pose an actual challenge to players in nulsec, helping limit afk safe farmers and maybe even rorquals online, sounds healthy to me.
---
That's a pretty liberal use of the word "journalist" there.
---
The drastic increase in the usage of the word is unprecedented.
---
For years we've been telling miners to stay aligned, pay attention to your overview, don't go AFK.  As drifters warp in, why don't you just warp to your aligned?
---
Wow those Retribution’s should have floored you. Especially 2 at once. Nasty things. Worst Retribution pilots I’ve seen in a long time.
---
I’d argue that being able to keep track of who/what is in a system, and approaching/on grid with you is a necessary skill for anyone leaving high sec.
---
I guess the first question was rhetorical.  Are these two rhetorical as well?
---
e-honour?
---
It is just names or descriptions where names go. We don't really know each other. While it can be an interesting distraction, opinions here don't really change our lives or matter.
---
Assume they aren’t, and humour me.
---
You’re nuts.  A HAM Loki can pull close to the dps of a Rattlesnake while having a comparable tank when taking speed and sig into account.  Name a BS/carrier or dread combo that is anywhere similar.
---
They hitting structures again?
---
Just make it every time you undock any ship there is a RNG roll.  1/100 chance that your ship blows up without any counter play that you can do it save it.  
---
Somehow that would not feel like entertainment, even if it was not very common.  
---
Change it around...now every time you are out ratting, playing the game, you get blown up by a random NPC with no counter play to save you. 
---
There is no ‘adapt’ to this.  You just die and have to reship.  
---
Just not very fun....
---
Not gonna buy unless there is an Extra Salty Edition available
---
Right click most things it’s pretty simple
---
Problem with this argument is those newbros in eve also pay the Corp tax in isk and time so it works.
---
yes, as well as anomalies.
---
&gt; 7% structure punisher vs active tank sabre Gets F'ed
---
I still read it wrong sometimes.
---
Okay, so the 'shut the hell up' was RP.
---
It was the Faithful Ammatar character who was currently fighting against the blooders yelling at the heretical Ammatar who was goading her to shut up.
---
Cool.
---
Less than negligible.
---
Bottom line is that these big null groups are not scams.  There’s actually considerable cost in terms of isk sinks that alliances have to pay in order to hold their space and that just for the naming rights.  Anyone can come take it from you if they are so inspired!
---
So that brings me to why newbro corps offer these incentives:   They need fresh recruits to fill the ranks doing all the things you’re already exposed to in high sec.  mining, ratting, etc.  they have experienced veterans available usually in all time zones for questions and to help new people.  They know that nurturing new people in the game makes Eve a healthier and more vibrant universe.  They also need you to form fleets necessary for fighting off invading fleets, protecting those members performing activities in space, and prosecuting any of various offensive campaigns that occur throughout the universe.  Even Brave just picked up a dozen systems in Scalding Pass!  All these actions take careful planning, logical supply lines, and a strong and engaged member base to form the fleets necessary to accomplish the alliances objectives.  
---
If you want to look for any kind of drawback, the organizations will expect over the course of a month of membership, that you’d find the time to experience the PvP fleet action.  It’s quite fun, even on the losing end, which you’ll find yourself on no matter what organization you choose.  On reddit you’ll undoubtedly have people telling you that the big bull groups are “bad” or that things are stale.  That all the want you for is to anchor on the fc and push F1 when they tell you.   It’s important for you to remember that all Eve players spend time learning from experienced FCs, big fleets or small gang included, and that it’s from the ranks of these members that Eves next generation of strategic fleet commanders are trained.  The opportunities are truly endless! 
---
Good luck!
---
Also... Dreddit is recruiting...
---
Im rewatching this right now
---
Yeah, sorry my phrasing is a bit off. I agree with you.
---
Drifters don’t show up on dscan. Even if you don’t overprop, or if you switch to a sentry dominix, you’re going to be dead if they warp to your site, because of how quickly they go from warping to shooting.
---
Lacking the journalistic integrity of The Eve Onion.

Why didn't you use your command burst?

Daegon Gabal did nothing wrong.
---
"Should we take this fight?"
---
"Fuck yes we should."
---
Logi training complied with. Goodfights.
---
This is false
---
It's likely that they were testing Diamond Rats hitting structures like they did with the Drifters in null.
---
Since there's a storyline going on with blood raiders hitting Amarr loyalists and Amarr groups, hitting an Amarr loyalist group who has been in the thick of things with blooder NPCs seems like a good way to do your test and give RPers story content at the same time.
---
It was just randomly out of nowhere.. we just rage-pinged and got a good number of people showing up from Amarrbloc and were able to defend it. 
---
Besides, messing with RPers is basically CCP Delegate Zero's job. \\o/
---
hi friend, have an upvote, I do appreciate the to be continue meme. Sorry if ruined your roam though :(
---
you can't see them on scan so there is no pre-warning they are coming, they just appear on grid, and they can scram you from farther away then they can shoot and they can insta lock you, this gives you maybe 1-2 seconds to press warp before you're locked down.
---
Most of the problem with battleships isn't actually battleships, it's caps. Though the scan res is too bad - it should be around 10-12s for that lock imo, which means you can lock something before it rams you.
---
But the problem here is the carrier with a lock time of 3 seconds and which can project DPS and tackle, with better tracking and application, to longer range. Battleships mostly only look bad because capitals are too good, or at least too versatile.
---
Dude, fuck the shield timer vOv
---
Just be sure it’s properly Brave fit with at least 2 salvage modules
---
They already do. Delve has almost 3 times the amount of attacks as other places
---
They warp, but they come out of warp way faster than a normal battleship
---
&gt; estimate time to address : 42 million years
---
And I'm sure, now that the well known and respected security expert /u/v2345 has spoken, everyone will see the error of their ways.
---
Oh, wait, nah, they're just a complaining fuckwit who doesn't know a damn thing.
---
Which just means that the only good way to rat now is in a super or Titan.
---
&gt; you can't see them coming on dscan
---
This needs looking at, if true (i.e. it isn't just that people haven't set up a dscan filter with them on). Diamond rats and drifter response battleships show up properly on D and these ships need to too.
---
These do not appear on dscan
---
Now I see what you guys were doing while we literally shit all over you in your staging system... and BOZ1-O
---
No one is salty I was just pointing out why this clip is nothing special. He had the matchup won unless the sabre had some blingy bs sabre lol.
---
Well, not for ratting supercaps. I’m sure more of those is just what Eve needs
---
Even if it has short range I feel like a BS with 2500dps and almost 3500m/s speed is just a tiny bit OP
---
r/eveporn/
---
Right. I’ll just stay aligned after I jump a gate. Because that’s possible
---
Thank you.
---
I am down for the whole new lp store thing to give more value for the lower lp payouts but i personal do not think ccp will keep on top of the exploit tbh you see how prolific bots are and if they do they will most likely over nerf it as apose to using dev time to keep taps on all the players exploiting it. but yeh i agree with you although i run those missions its not because i want to i want to constantly be doing pvp and more reward/incentive to do so in fw would be good.

---
when did they redo the cormorant model?
---
Hahaha xD
---
Vindicator can get into the same ballpark DPS as a carrier. But yeah, that's close range and the only other one even close after that is the rattlesnake.
---
&gt;drifters don’t show up on dscan
---
In that case, excuse my ignorance on that, thats unacceptable on CCPs part.
---
I do stand by my point though. More danger in null is good. there should be SOME counterplay, i agree, but i also believe nul is way too safe
---
Nope)
---
Not necessarily. Cap boosters are a thing
---
Supers can take up to 45-60 secs to align.
---
cause iam bad \^\^
---
Karmafleet is the best newbro corporation out there
---
You can’t see them coming
---
You must remember me. That's good. That's how right I was!
---
I see you are still virtue signaling about 2fa!
---
Also you're an Olmeca Gold supporter just like Pax? Yikes now I see where you're coming from.
---
That ship sailed so long ago
---
Ok I am like 90% sure this is sarcastic so why the fuck are you being downvoted?
---
The Nestor already has a 2.5 AU warp speed. I don't see a balance issue with making other Battleships have the same.
---
10/10 you made me upvote a TAPI member (or buy a flair bait)
---
That’s true. It’s probably much closer though with public contracts, but also much harder to quantify.
---
You are not wrong.
---
 Although mittens is just speaking on the terms of his fellow goon. I dunno what you are on about mate.
---
not  particularly.
---
there's nothing interesting or engaging about suddenly losing your ship because the rng gods put one of those in your ratting site.
---
Let's say a region has two anomalies per system.  When one is completed, another is randomly generated somewhere else in the region. Some systems will pile up with anomalies until players decide to go do them.  
---
Voila.  You now have players spreading out.  
---
Hint:  This is how wormholes work and why corps spread out over multiple holes.

I gotta be honest, didn't expect to actually be asked for the memey answer so i don't have one prepared. Just add random 2012 memes to the following text in your head.
---
Personally my love of Brave has waned as a result of being allied with test. We were at war with test when i last left Eve and being allied with them now doesn't sit well with me. 
---
Anyway you are a prominent member of Brave leadership. A member of Legacy, part of a social superstructure known as "the blue donut." This makes you a prime meme target for the demoralized victims of said superstructure.
---
It indiscriminately kills any sub cap whether or not its a player, an afk ship, or botters. Its pointless to have this kill everything. It encourages everyone to be insupers and rorqs. That discourages new players and directly kills ccps goal of better than 4% new player retention. Also they should be targeting low power structures and actually following up on killing them. Current mechanics are just broken, pointless, and dumb.
---
It would take far too much discipline for them to actually affect the Hi\*sec markets. Eve is a huge marketplace and I think they are over estimating the impact they can inflict upon it.
---
Per aspera ad inferni
---
&gt;What's frustrating is that CCP could buff BS scan resolution, lock range, or warp speed by 20% and have little risk of messing things up.
---
That's why they won't do it, CCP only changes things if there's a 99% chance of fucking things up.
---
Sounds really cool to me
---
My guidance counselor didn't tell me that I could shitpost for a living either!
---
stay aligned, not AFK and pay attention to your overview ... warp out when you see them warp in.
---
Good luck controlling that many players, a few members from each corp will let their alts bleed nullsec into public markets and prices will increase by a marginal amount
---
Reddit is not the place to seek technical support from CCP. 
---
Quit ya' bitching and try their website.
---
No...

Downvotes to the right

Are you for real? Wasn't BoB's main rival at that time Redswarm? You know, the group famous for out numbering any other group in the game? Mega coalitions have been in Eve for the majority of Eve's life.

---
It already blew up lol
---
To be fair, a BS moving that fast isn't going to hit anything at close range (the only range you'd be able to hit that high DPS at) - and you'd have to be overheating your guns and MWD the entire time anyhow to maintain either of those stats
---
Weird place you chose to complain about a billing problem... In any case, my experience with CCP delivering on purchases always depended on my own credit card... And usually I get my Omega time in a matter of minutes!

You are missing an important incentive. The game is better when more people are around. So nurturing you so that you grow up and stick around with the game even if you don't stick around with them is a benefit to them even if it doesn't seem like it at face value.

So much for going camping on the Kentucky River this year. On the bright side, at least it was one of the mediocre mass market bourbons we export to Yankees and foreigners who don't know what good bourbon is. The funny this is we had another bourbon warehouse disaster almost a year ago to the day: [https://www.courier-journal.com/story/life/food/spirits/bourbon/2018/06/22/kentucky-distillery-barton-1792-collapses/725686002/](https://www.courier-journal.com/story/life/food/spirits/bourbon/2018/06/22/kentucky-distillery-barton-1792-collapses/725686002/)
---
yeah so much this :(
---
I'd be happy with a DPS buff on almost every BS tbh.
---
Except the leshak of course
---
At least the Confederate flag is gone now.
---
Instawarp when you see them warping in because you’re aligned  say “Hi”.

So long as they don’t mess with the amount of turret harpoons in the rokh I’ll be fine. Gota have my mining rokh
---
Who?
---
the new drifters continuously come back too and reinforce stations in the same systems, so because no one knows how long this event is going to go on its entirely possible they will follow up on armor timers they create just by being in the system when the shield timer ends, the chances of it happening are low, but not impossible, so the more shield timers you prevent the less likely they get the chance to follow up on one there is.

I’m so sorry. You spent all that time to write a post that nobody cares about. I know how it feels. I hope you find your happiness one day

RvB grows low and slow :-)  
---
we got regular fleet with like up to 20 ppl.
---
so we started to take care of the logi situation. cause its not good that all Veteran pilots fly logi. :-)
---
AWESOME work from the logi
---
afterwards we got a small gate camp crashed sadly no footage from that.
---
Why do you fly with friendlies on your PvP overview, or was it temp because you were training?
---
lol BS
---
Well most of the time I think CCP reimburses your first loss to some recent change or for a dumb game mechanic.
---
For me, I've gotten a reimbursement for getting traffic controlled by someone cross jumping a wormhole and closing it. Now that has been around for years and years and still hasn't been changed. 
---
Some of my Corp mates have also got reimbursements for similar situations. 
---
TLDR; They generally give a free reimbursement for most things that are kind of lame. However I think it's more like a, you made a mistake, here is a refund, don't make it again type reimbursement.

In 2019, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a CCP court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade to the Icelandic underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem... if no one wants to help... and if you can find them... maybe you can hire... The Bot-Team.

&gt;Fixed it for you

Ah yes the credible source of a reddit account named EchoChambersAreBad4u, alrighty then!

Beautifully done! Let Nullsec burn! The empires have sat comfortably for too long! All hail our Drifter overlords!

Sort of interesting that it only took a few years for people in a video game to realize that wars aren't worth the cost that it takes to wage them.   
---
Even when the cost is vastly lower than it is in the real world.
---
Exookie will do what he always does; disappear for 9 months, come back and do something for his own corp, chest beat, and nothing much else.
---
do you still play
---
What if the jump gate structures could only be used by sub caps?

When you agree with an HK player and wonder if you’re gay now

I was in EveUni for a while and they are absolutely on the up and up. They were a huge help. They have a fair amount of info online which is accessible to nonmembers. 
---
RvB isn’t explicitly for newbies but they were a great community. Everyone was very supportive and I learned a ton.
---
You sir are awesome.
---
I fly nearly all engagement (the small one ) with this OV. i want to know where my space nerds are.
---
Iam new to Fcing "doctrines" and it makes it easier for me to see them.
---
When we fight against other bigger fleets ofc i use another tab
---
u/CCP_falcon
---
Elaborate, ok but assume this is theory.
---
So let's say Bob is a camper who wants to target new players because.. blue killboard or whatever.
---
Now he knows there is going to be standing fleets for the capitals and maybe a few gatecamps.  He is going to sit in a system or some connected ones and thus avoid Gates and he's going to do so alone as to not draw a defense fleet easily.  There has to be a strategy to reduce his risk further, like a cloak.... You know that's too perfect and I wish I didn't feel the need to mention it. Maybe he uses a long range weapon system with high dps so those cruisers are dead long before they can reach him. Maybe more. 
---
These type of things are what I am asking about. What should we expect to see? How can we counter assuming we would be dead long before help arrives. And also who does them would be nice. Set up an ambush if possible.
---
Because killboards matter and you don't want to be the laughing stock of Eve online for losing the first structures duh~
---
Any one ever had a chance to punch Mittani in the face? If you have I’ll buy you a beer.
---
What’s this supposed to mean?
---
why would anyone still play this game?
---
yep the hype was real. We talk about ppl who nearly see combat. Its awesome to see how they celebrate this victory.
---
and ofc they saw how important Logi is and they like it.
---
cringe
---
So, I poked CCP falcon, because I wanna know if they've seen this and/or discussed this.. also because I want this
---
Shout out to this "one of us"  
---
thanks to this gent we get this all done.
---
Who exactly do you think is going to stop a coalition of Imperium, Gotg, Legacy, Panfam and Frat, from doing whatever they want to do? If the drifters keep up long enough for the hisec thing to get started then hisec is definitely going to burn
---
-256/10
---
Why thank you.
---
Free gigx?
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that T1 battleships aren't covert ops capable, therefore cannot use the covert jump bridge
---
Yes you can. No one is going to notice if you spend a minute keeping at range on another ship of the same class and not shooting 
---
Obviously if you get primaried you’ll die, but if you’re afk in null you risk dying to roamers.
---
What if he's hiding in one system and only comes out to ambush a ship he knows he can kill long before help can arrive. Then waits for help to leave and repeats.
---
oh shit whaddup
---
F. I remember when I user to get abused by him and Nina. Gone too soon man. RIP
---
\#FREE NOLAK
---
Something tells me your new too the game, posts like these come across like a spoilt brat. Also it’s a Astra they are ammo. Everything in this game goes pop at one point just embrace it and have fun.
---
Good.
---
If all I can afford is a cruiser and I am trying to make money for the unending book list, how do I counter you if you can dps me down in seconds? If your a hunter moving around I can wait you out, but what if your using game mechanics to sit in system safely to ambush?
---
This is what eve needs. EVE is not dying, it never was, it was just a build up to this kind of chaos.
---
Fly safe m8 o7 :)
---
I didn't say that, someone else did and your e-rage is so strong you are miss-attributing it to me to find some fault to pick at.
---
And where are they now?
---
If this was true, then they wouldn't be sending drifters into anoms that can instantly kill any subcap, and as well fuck over most carriers. Leading to people making the choice between trying to play the game and hope they don't win the drifter lotto.
---
&gt;someone else did
---
Yeah - that someone is me, you cube-brain. I reposted it so you would read it. JFs can't fight back, other ships have a fighting chance. You really are this dense, aren't you?
---
I want to finish the Sister's of Eve The Bloodstained Tears act but the Triglavian invasion is in Tar.  I guess I'll mine some veldspar until they leave.  My combat ships are in Tar Station.  :p
---
Unsubbed.
---
Honest question, when was brave at war with Test?
---
So wait, your argument is that your JF can't fit a burst projector or unbounded light drones, and you think that will save it?
---
Wtf is this ccp’s way of deleting Nullsec?😂
---
Unban lenny kravitz boys
---
Yeah but even if they do armor they still have to follow up on structure, the chance of drifters following up every single timer is probably 0
---
Like I was saying, the smaller middle sized groups are getting killed off by the larger groups and the smaller groups running to the larger ones.
---
Your post chain does nothing to argue against this.
---
Lol, why are people complaining about shield timers anyways?

CCP gonna go big aggro when Concord starts fucking with null local
---
Absolutely.
---
People were crying so bad for the citadel spam that CCP decided to send a clean-up crew.
---
&gt;The Plex they buy with ISK are from the whales, that pay to win, but if CCP can turn those Plex´d accounts into Subbed accounts then more income for CCP
---
A) ALL plex on the market was paid for by a person @~ $20/500
---
B) 1 month of omega costs 500 plex which if you buy it means that someone paid $20 for your omega
---
C) one month of omega costs $15 
---
D) $20 is more money than $15
---
E) MATH!!!!
---
If you are being cloaky camped, move to a different system to do your PVE. If the hunter follows you, I *guarantee* there are windows during which they are not cloaked. Get some friends (you're not going to take them 1v1), bait them in, and crush them.
---
We like to be able to shoot everyone! 
---
But on serious note on smallish gang with new bros you need to be able to see distance etc ie they not wandering off into oblivion or they getting to close to targets.  So keeping an eye on both fleets is a must more challenging but has its rewards. 
---
Add onto that duel boxing there isn’t much time for flicking through tabs in overview etc because you need to bounce between clients. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
Alright. As far as someone camping a system, pay attention to local. If you see someone around often and they’re not part of your corp/alliance/coalition, look them up on [zkillboard](https://zkillboard.com/). See if they’ve killed other people recently in your area and if those kills are people in your group. Their killboard will say a lot about them like: 
---
- what they like to fly
---
- where they like to hunt
---
- if they prefer to jump explorers, miners, ratters, etc. 
---
If you are in a populous system with active fleet commanders looking to train newbros, you could probably convince one of them to lead a quick fleet to take a camper out. See if you can bait the camper, surprise tackle, and then your fleet can jump in to warp to you. 
---
If you’re alone and worried about the person, leave the system. If you don’t want to leave or they follow you, again, see if some other people want to work with you to run protection. Offer them some compensation for their time. 
---
There is one more important thing that I think might be more at the heart of this question: You’re going to get blown up. You will lose your ship. You might even think it happened in a broken or unfair way. Don’t fall into this kind of thinking. It is not unlikely for you to get destroyed in NullSec. It’s meant to be more risky because there is greater reward. Even if someone is camping a system with a strong ship, it’s just part of the game and there are ways to get around it and avoid it. It’s not broken, even though it may be annoying. If it turns out to be a bigger problem, you can likely get your corp mates to help you out in dealing with the issue. 
---
So don’t worry. Life in a big corp that is looking out for you is great. NullSec is an interesting part of the game that is worth exploring. In the end, it’s just fake money and internet spaceships so go out, explore, make friends, get blown up, and do it all again tomorrow.
---
Do you have like... *any* evidence to support this, or did this entire post come out of your ass?
---
Holy shit dude. Go back and read the original comment chain that started this.
---
Actually wait. Let me put it here since you have trouble reading. Here:
---
&gt;JFs are actually really difficult to use and extremely punishing when done incorrectly. 
---
&gt;You lose them if you fuck up. [...] How is that any more punishing than any other ship in the game?
---
Fighting chance = burst jammer, EC-300s, etc. An Occator traveling in low/null can save itself with a burst jammer when it's scrammed and then MJD or warp. A procurer can potentially force a tackle ceptor off with light drones or ec-300s before the heavy dps arrives. There are even more options, like cloaks, afterburners to try and get back to a gate, even cynos if you're in a place where you can get help.
---
JFs can't use these things. The other ships can. They have fighting chances, JFs do not. JFs are therefore more punishable when flown incorrectly.
---
Please, for your own sake - if not to help reduce mass exasperation from everyone you interact with in your daily life, take an English class.
---
Yeah I'm bored now because I can't rat without worrying about winning the drifter lotto and there's no fleets to join because everyone is too busy swatting drifters away from stations. Might as well quit.
---
That bee should be a dino
---
The funny part is that the most most effective way to fight them is with caps and supers, CCP not doing much to discourage the frowned upon proliferation.  Would it not have been better to encourage downshipping into smaller fleets of subcaps, spread out over various systems by introducing a forced PVE mechanic that required people be spread out and not using the umbrella everyone complains about?
---
It looks like CCP was serious about a shake up. This is good. 
---
It will force us to adapt and move away from farms / fields citadels online.
---
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to sit here and pretend to give a fuck anymore about this issue. Ask someone who cares what they think about it, I have no doubt it'll make just as little difference as your feckless whining and distress.
---
It is an unprecedented change in language flying in the face of the old wisdom that there is nothing new under the sun.
---
I think your missing the point. Judging by the responses a fair number of players are very happy to see the changes in game mechanics.
---
They want the spread of citadels to have a cost. Before this event there was post after post on here about how boring the current war mechanics were due to how citadels work.
---
That was because they were whinging. Now there is actual data to support it. Both Subscription and login numbers are consistently going down, year on year, season on season. Did you miss the reddit post about this with all the data discussed?
---
6/10 didnt call him bee man
---
I've been asking myself the same since people realized they weren't following the timers. Maybe because noone really knows what happens so "best to be sure"?
---
Lets not get to carried away
---
Couldn't find a way to fit it, sorry 😭
---
You know op is not from ccp right?
---
Who are you again?
---
Nah he still got it
---
Biomass.
---
Getting blown up is not the issue. It's avoiding it long enough to buy all the crap I have to buy to progress. In your scenario all the camper has to do is hide when the defense fleet comes and resume when they leave.
---
Yes REEEEE
---
Only matters if drifters followup on timers.
---
its not fun its a utter waste of time my dude i was having fun killing people but instead i gotta go save a structure. Fun.
---
What about my comment lead you to believe that I was in any way whatsoever implying that OP was CCP? Huh?
---
The fact that CCP can put up with some of the more vocal aspects of the EvE community restores my faith in humanity.
---
GJ logi !!!
---
You should've named the movie "dullsec".
---
Please biomass without extracting and uninstall
---
I love it when a plan comes together
