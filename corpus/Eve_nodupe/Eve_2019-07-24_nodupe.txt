Wormholers want fights, but they will be honorable unless you are actively a dick or refuse to give fights. 
---

---
Ganks will happen, that's a given. But request 1v1s or 2v2s and you'll get them. And it is one of the best ways to make friends in wormholes. 
---
Avoid fighting? And people start getting aggravated with you.
---
---
---
So business as usual, then?
---
Switches are for casuals, but also go suck on Jintaan's nuts, you dumb fuck.
---
I'd also suggest you skill yourself tbh. Pretty sad such an elite PVP god like you can't fucking move his ship at more than 450ms to mitigate almost all capital damage.
---
But yeah, skill yourself and get better pvp god.
---
I've been FC in DIN for 2 years and honestly, a lot of the things you list are wrong or misinformed which is making me question why you write so much about your pyfa numbers.  
---
The 3 most prevalent things being:  
---
- the most effective sniper in a shield comp is the nightmare, which has space for tracking computers. Machariels are only really usefull in contest situations.  
---
  
---
- the impact of an outuni is much lower than you pretend it to be, a single cap transfer suffices to turn your tank back on even if you happen to run dry.
---
- weve literally done it with 4 scimis and cap transfers from nightmares before without losing anything.  
---
i dont envy incursion runners these days thinking what WTM does is standard or required
---
"I was wrong...." most commonly used phrase in EvE Online
---
UwU
---
I bought 3 smaller ones for 70 mil a pop to last until I could use the extended.
---
yup. losing a capsule = permadeath. I haven't worked out all the rules yet but im thinking of limiting items im allowed to buy. or maybe if i truly go crazy, im not allowed to buy anything. I know this might sound batshit-crazy and I'll prolly never get very far, (especially if I go the "dont buy anything" route) but this sounds fun in my head so it's worth a shot. after playing for 3 years i need to spice things up a bit.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also i might make a weekly update thread on the sub if ppl are interested in my hardcore eve antics, we'll see i guess.
---
Anything not from two years ago that fits your narrative of you being super anti mission runner? Or did you lose the self that you claim I was finding?
---
ccplease
---
You have a correct fit for the arty cane? The arty takes almost all the pg. HFI it s pretty good but arty can is warm imo.
---
Pretty much, yup! More fun that way. If you want to run something organized at that size you can go cruisers with 2 logi 1 ewar and everyone else in dps(usually brawling is good.)
---
Well if you're just trying to get the isk out of it because of the margin(usually not worth on plex) that much really doesn't matter.
---
In my opinion if you have unlimited isk the best ships to learn would be faction cruisers like the nosprey omen navy and scythe fleet. Fit them kitty and not like brawlers.
---
The reason why cruisers over frigates is, they simply are easier to fly than frigates, you are fast enough to kite but slow enough that you don’t overburdened heavily or get too close to fast as you would in a frigate.
---
And they have decent power tp actually kill stuff semi quickly
---
there's a reason for it
---
Yup the ole Russiantitanowener switcheroo
---
What's the skinny on the current "kill ships, get skill points" ?  
---
Doesn't seem to be much information floating around?
---
Why your tag is Waffles?
---
Wait for a lowest gate to appear?
---
&gt;Epeen 
---
Never not. 
---
But really, isk is cheap, this game is so much more fun when you go balls deep; blind jump gates, have a procurer scout, whatever. Have fun and don’t worry about KD or isk positivity (as long as you’re not welping caps + supers)
---
Fuckers need to enjoy themselves bit more.
---
Fit a burst jammer (use tech 1 enduring for frigate since they take a lot of cap) when roaming to null or wormhole, can save your ass. Saved my ass trice.
---
Fuck snuff
---
Yes. Can you hook me up? 
---
Gotta be careful though - Vily gets all twisted when you sell us ships and minerals so we can continue farming you.
---
&gt;but I still get the feeling that I'm setting us up to get welped
---
It's a T1 Frigate gang. Half the fun is getting welped!
---
I'm still new and basically a minion.  But my understanding is, they did this to NoVac in the past and this was a revenge move.  But IDK. Personally, I dont care either.
---
ew
---
Sorry just need to ask Russian ice bears for titans instead of dreads. Maybe I'll snag one from ya next time. Hard to beat goon titan prices
---
Unfortunately the game is in a downward spiral, I hope CCP can recover but I doubt it. Was fun while it lasted.
---
Who is walking out the door?
---
Dude has all these votes that support his claus but doesnt include the most voted up topics on the discord. Like the 40 upvotes for removing missions and the 1 against it. 
---
also no, citadel lockout will destroy fw.
---
yeah whichever one works rn - isk and sp don't matter for OP.
---
Game is dying so he is like, fuck it.
---
Amarr Surveillance General Major denying the killmail you would have gotten going to a market hub with your fucking main like a retard.
---
Damn thanks for taking the time man, but i was thinking for doing combat sites just for fun haha, is there a more time friendly fit than this build? XD
---
Thanks, I'll check it out!
---
For people recommending bcs like brutix and cane, would you suggest a mjd?
---
My time on CSM left me feeling that CCP spends literally zero time thinking about FW or LS in general. There were specific instances where I honestly thought FW's existence was forgotten about. I mean literally forgotten, as in if it wasn't brought up specifically that you would only think HS/NS/WH space existed.
---
The real question is how is you titian
---
I mean... I wouldn't say no. :p
---
As I pointed out in the other thread, there's nothing wrong with doing this. Devs have no reason to get involved.
---
Oh I don’t mind 90% of Stain. Ferra is a shitstain on Stain. The rest are fine.
---
My Corp has Russians in it. Git gud! Find a real burn.
---
I really hope Abyssal is classified as an NPC
---
It's not a matter of wanting it, but to call the first documented case of it an exploit when it's a logical conclusion of game mechanics. I wouldn't be upset if they patched it, but to immediately jump to calling them exploiters feels awfully witch-hunty
---
are these all inventive words for "stealth bomber fleet" or what?? i used to think a Goku fleet was torp bombers w/ no cloak or something, but looking @ losses there's something of everything there, cloaks, no cloaks, so on. honest question, what's the dif between a Stuka fleet, a Goku fleet, and a Stealth Bomber fleet??
---
Don’t wait for every person.  You will have special cases who fly sideways 8 gates behind in larger gangs.   That’s fine.
---
Engage everything. Don’t chase little zippy crap 300 of gate. Everybody just wants to shoot shit.
---
So basically you want a tactical mode
---
I can see this being implemented simply by replacing the already existing ‘tactical view’
---
I actually toyed with the idea of doing a battle royale in a corp's wormhole. You seed planets and moons with ships and modules dispersed at different locations and everybody starts in corvettes.
---
making chessur proud
---
Not special. Just not dumb.
---
Typical
---
Oh, we got sent a second fleet later after a rage ping. There was only enough time to grab whatever kind of bomber was available. There was about 100 of us that didn't get on the cap kills but we still got some harpies and a Muninn that crashed.
---
Someone add up the fuel costs.  Is the titan pilot isk positive?
---
I would say that in and of itself isn’t a crime but... trust yer instincts on this one.
---
From a new player prospective the answer to why is a little more obvious. It's the last ship in progression in a decade old game. If there are so many long term players why not expect a plethora of Titan pilots?
---
Are they imbalanced? Hell if I know. Are skill injectors a problem? I don't see anyone complaining about free skill points. I see long term players with trillions of isk and massive incomes. Is the problem your a "have not"? I do not know.
---
Some Items can't be tracked for whatever reason, I recently went to check on the Sisters of EvE Advanced Combat Suit and coulnd't find it at all.
---
But I know its in the game since I'm wearing it right now, its just hidded(?) and wont show up if you look for it.
---
I can't help you but you might want to travel to some ORE offices and check vendors for yourself!
---
The distance from your ship to the other ship on the tactical map is marked by the white dot on your tactical plane. 
---
If that dot is within your red circle of death, you can shoot it. 
---
The arc just connects the two and represents equidistant points in the intersecting plane of travel.
---
So? Not all russians are in one block lol
---
oh look things that wont happen, nice
---
It only makes sense to fit a deactivated cloak on a Goku bomber. If situation demands,you can always deactivate a torp and turn on the cloak.
---
Your right. Buy ships and  modules you have shit skills to use to their potential and lose them all instead of spending money on something you cant lose at all.
---
This guy gives good advice
---
I’d wager so. I’m a citadel baby I have no clue what the per hour rate of a pos is.  But basically since the OP, all the comments have Maury poviched this guy to be in fact a lying sack of ferra shit.
---
LMAO
---
its called spherical geometry.
---
I guess it took them trailing around a legit fc?
---
Teach them a few simple commands like "starburst," or have preset groups that know to go left or right together, or up/down, sunward and antisunward.  That is vaguely useful for when you encounter a gang of kitey types in T3Ds.   Sometimes moving in the opposite direction is the fastest way to get there.
---
Some opponents might have the sense to leave the field when they are enveloped, but there are others who don't look at anything but range.    
---
If everyone is mobile, then everyone is a scout.  Everyone should know their job, no-one should be passive unless they have a specific co-scanning task.
---
If someone wants to bring something heavier, require them to have hyperspatials fit, and to leave the light tackle to the mobility specialists.
---
Trust me I've never considered WTM a standard for anything. Flew with ARMOR-1 then TDF. :p
---
Poor drones got evaporated.
---
Shield boost amps are not usefull against high alpha volleys since they tend to penetrate into armor and then structure. You want two boosters to plug your hole so that you don't bleed as much.
---
In Jspace you usually fight subcaps wich can apply lots of damage inbetween rep cycles.
---
He is tanking with his capital sized ehp wich should be fine in theory, its only a dread afterall.
---
All those cap modules make him cycle his guns through the hardest neut you'd encounter.
---
Nothing and no one will beat Grath, not even Shadoo (but he's gold himself).
---
I always wondered what Vilys real name was...
---
&gt; also no, citadel lockout will destroy fw.
---
Paying extra fuel on staging citadels or key citadels until the system can be retaken is the intended method of avoiding lockout for the non-system-owning faction.  It's written.
---
&gt; doesnt include ... removing missions
---
Definitely L4's would be gutted in terms of PVP-independent income and availability.  If you read between the lines, missions are dead before the first page is done.
---
Votes proposals that didn't provide significant explanation or perhaps present a different take on anything were not included.  Feel free to include votes that are represented in the doc, have details, and are not recorded.  This document was never a summary of the Dischord era.  It's lineage was definitely the Faction Warfare Justice thread I began with a while ago, which was itself mainly informed from comms discussions rather than written record.
---
We felt this way as well
---
well you can go for meta 4 beams, and a named AB. You could also go for named hardeners but in that case I'd use faction ones.
---
The login event was a total of 9 days with only 7 providing rewards. It’s day seven
---
Not really no. Small gangs, just like big gangs and PvEers and everyone else are really really risk adverse. PvPers are prob the worst honestly. So most of the time this so called content is just a nuisance. Id much rather actually fight offensive wars rather than having to deal with a couple of roamers who..
---
But I mean, I wouldnt want to or cant stop anyone from roaming, people can do what they like. But I also dont like it when everyone has to adapt to allow for that. You want to roam, fine, but dont complain about supers getting dropped on your head. Because thats how much people enjoy small gangs, we dont drop big stuff to play, we do it so people fk off.
---
But that isnt really what I was saing in the above. Im just saying that the balance is dead, no more no less.
---
A stuka fleet means it is being done by Init. A goku fleet means it is done by not init. 
---
Both refer to booshing AB torp bombers, supported by frigate logi and frigate ewar (hyena and keres, mostly). Init usuallly has a cloak on theirs, while horde does not, but the cloak is almost never used.
---
Would be fun if the ships are all shitfits, or mix matched guns and stuff.
---
I dont think you understand how caps work. But sure, go ahead.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/73872610/
---
this is the moon you claim to have camped for 5 years, why lie?
---
nice try, CCP, we know you're only doing this to try and pump up the log in numbers
---
Because they only set up the pos in 2018 and nobody camped this for more than a few months. OP claims the titan was stolen in 2014 not camped since 2014.
---
In this thread seems to be a whole bunch of nulsec dudes jumping at the bit to call them highsec scrubs and get super defensive when someone dares to challenge that logic. 
---
With this in mind If ask you the same thing.
---
Get fucked sleeper dreams
---
You sound a lot like my group I started playing with years and years ago. I'm the only one who still plays (and even then I've been inactive for the last few years, just resubbed recently)
---
I've been looking into some trade/industry stuff recently and recognise your pains. I think the general gist nowadays is getting incremental manufacturing efficiency bonuses from both the BP (if possible - harder to achieve with T2 stuff) as well as from the manufacturing attributes of the station. Player owned bases can be decked out with manufacturing rigs which give an extra buff to manufacturing efficiency. It's only a few extra %, but it makes the difference.
---
Not 100% clear all of the above is correct, as it's changed a lot from when I was last active, but basically it is possible to get more bang for your buck from BPs, but it does require a fair bit of investment (and of course, the manufacturing buffs are rougly doubled for being out of highsec). 
---
And then finally once you have your newly produced item, you have to find somewhere to sell it. Jita it will probably sell fastest, but you'll make a smaller margin (if any) because it's so competitive. One of the other major trade hubs can make a huge difference.
---
[Here's an online tool to help check the profitability of manufacturing from BPs, with a Dominix as an example.](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/blueprint/?typeid=645)
---
It's so competitive that in most trade hubs, 0 skills and 0 ME will net you a loss. But at decent skills and 10ME, you'll hit profit in some areas (ie, not Jita)
---
What TZ are you in? Like I say, I just resubbed recently and you sound like you're at a pretty similar position in the game as I am right now
---
Ok, I have run them before, but I did one last week and it wasn’t 30-40 seconds on grid before they blew up and the response fleet warped in.
---
The only thing I can think I did wrong was engage warp to it without cloaking, and it was a long warp. If you are uncloaked, does the timer start on warp activation?
---
Glorious.
---
It isn't now.
---
This is really cool. First game I've seen where you get a pip on your hull for every kill you earn in that ship ... Unless Elite does it too. I've never used a combat bracket for my ship's registry decal, but I was under the assumption that the pips there were decorative only.
---
no, the best time was when power of 2 was still a thing.
---
&gt; You need to accept that different people.play eve differently 
---
Oh man, let's just do this all again.
---
Your argument is invalid because it clearly states that play styles that affect highly related states of the universe in an inseparable manner can be interpreted as independent or "just another playstyle."
---
If an interceptor could fly out to belts and mine 24km3 per second and ultra-compress it and go sell it in Jita, Rorq pilots would be upset.  They are both producing the same resource, but interceptors, a ship that is not intended to dominate mining, would be completely obliterating the entire role for Rorquals, ostensibly ships and players who intended to play mining games.  
---
The unbounded production of LP by mission runners is no different.  it is not merely a different playstyle.  Nobody intended that missions would break the rest of the faction warfare economy independently of how those players affected the rest of the warzone.  The mechanic CCP intended to provide as carrot to the warzone, access to LP for faction warfare pilots, is heavily compromised by players who have nothing to do with the warzone.  We are not independent of this activity any more than Rorq pilots would be of interceptors out-mining them.
---
&gt; I only submitted that to show the absurdness in all suggestions basically removing missions from fw
---
Somehow I don't think, "the players _really_ don't want A" and "the players _really_ want B" is the kind of evidence you need to say A and B are basically the same.
---
Just..  There is no way you are truly this dense.  This is epic trolling.
---
ya honestly when people are trying to move solo im sure theyre all about wanting to bash a new random astra anchored by the local hunter group haha epic
---
I mean how you backstab, refuse to cordinate properly, bicker over jew and renter stystems. Fuck goons handed yall your biggest win in the holloween war and internal drama fucked you and made you lose it all.
---
I have little exploration experience as well, but what the career trainer didn't make clear is that you're only allowed to fail a hack a certain number of times before the object explodes. I lost a Sunesis I'd just bought learning this the hard way. I was in a L3 data or relic site (can't remember which) and a squadron of hostiles dropped out of warp just as I hit the hacking interface. So of course my first reaction was to get out of the hack and decide whether I could fight the pirates or have to bug out. As soon as I did, I got the killmail and a friendly little insurance payout of like an ISK and a half because none of the insurance policies had any payout above that. So while this may not be helpful to figuring out how you popped, now you know in the future that if bandits warp in, you need to pass a hack most rikki tick or else risk a fatal explosion.
---
Most fights are frigates or destroyers specifically because they're cheap and easy to replace. If you can afford it, go out in something bigger so that the fights last longer. Cruisers are, in general, the most enjoyable mix of speed, durability, and firepower in the game.
---
No.  Kill2 aka CCPRise
---
he was a prolific solo/small gang pvp pilot who made some very good videos back in the day.  He was knows for his theorycrafting and for this he was hired as a dev for game balance.
---
Because who doesn’t like Waffles?
---
Nerf reddit this was terrible storytelling. I'll never get to sleep like this
---
Just so you know, in case you were using the whole probe UI, you can detach the D-Scan UI from the window so you have just the list of detected objects and the range/angle menus. I would have liked to have the bubble visible as well, but my screen is too small to carry a resolution above ~700x1300.
---
You mean you want to move the goalposts.  I didn't even owe you the first response.
---
MD, this is about you.  Faction Warfare economy needs to change.  You keep avoiding making the simple statement that L4 missions, really all forms of unbounded LP sources that have nothing to do with PVP, have no place in Faction Warfare.  This is not personal.  It's objective truth.  Why not just say what seemingly every other faction warfare player knows?  This is not a vocal minority of hardcore PVP pilots.
---
Mostly Covert Ops Frigates are used.
---
I prefer to explore with them as they can warp faster between solar systems, and I think their bonuses are higher than T3C or faction exploration ships.
---
If I find something I need my cruiser for; I'll go back and get it later.
---
You just launched them and after a second or two they became active. Honestly they were (and still would be) completely worthless. (Other than for lagging people out which was their only practical use)
---
I'm talking to prove a point one of our pilots setup a field took a rifter and went full tilt through it with an after burner trying to maximize the damage, and still didn't rose shields.
---
Realistically though to cover an area with mines would require either an absurd quantity of mines, or for mines to home agressively, or for their blast radius to be huge, all of which could make them broken powerful. If you can Target and shoot them though, their usefulness drops to zero since that means you can detect and therefore avoid them.
---
I do get (and like) the idea of being able to deploy something anticapital ship defensively, even more so in the sense of specifically setup up traps to add risk to capital ships especially when used enmass. (As such a thing could dramatically diminish the value of front lining super caps, etc and could create opportunities to trap and kill super caps easier)
---
However I think instead of a mine like these, perhaps a deployable sentry turret with a gun like the ones the abyss ships use. Give it excellent range, but terrible ability to track, starts with negligible damage that ramps up to crazy high output after a while. Point being you manage to lock down a super, out pop laser deployables, the super in fine at first, but eventually that damage camps up to a level to tank can with stand.
---
This also inheritantly doesn't benefit from mobbing. With the ramp up doing negligible damage for a bit, throwing a hundred out still is negligible damage. (At that point you're better off just using conventional weapons to overwhelm your target) really it's just have enough on the field that you can survive and hold the super long enough for the drone to ramp up. (Which would favor a different breed of gate fleet that's specialized for large ship ganking) it'd focus heavily on logistics just to keep everyone alive while you wait for the ramp up.
---
Still has issues that'd need to be addressed, but honestly we need more options that simply throwing more pilots at doesn't scale particularly well with.
---
Small independent ns groups(all 3 of them): blackout is fine, pretty fun actually
---
nullblocs: BLACKOUT WILL KILL THE SMALL GROUPS, WE WONT BE AFFECTED BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO THE SMALL GUY THINK OF THE SMALL GUY I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND WE WONT BE AFFECTED BTW

k
---
haha nc bad
---
upvotes to the left
---
Good points in post/comments. I think there is also a leadership and organization problem that could be incentivized by reworked mechanics. System upgrades and the rank system need more impact. Becoming a Colonel or whatever in the militia should have some in game mechanic attached to it.
---
When have I avoided it? When I suggested counter play to mission? when I took Templar Danes screen shots and proposal to delete missions to the csm? When? 
---
You keep making false allegations. I'm waiting for an apology at this point

Story of my EVE PvP career.
---
Would that still be classified as a "song?"
---
Could've been two Titans if there was a gate from lowsec
---
Sorry guys I finally got home and have time to translate full Battle Report as it actually happened:
---
Act 1:  
---
Ferra was lazy camping 4GQ station awaiting Alexia SSS to finally undock after stocking up in friendly 4GQ market. There are a few regulars online as well as FC. Aranee yells Erebus on scan in 4GQ. Everyone reships to Sabres and warps to gates. While we are doing that Erebus is on scan but we should have undocked at least someone with combat probes, by the time someone gets in combat scanner it is too late. We see cyno in VYJ and morale goes down and we give up thinking that he jumped out.
---
Act 2 Nicho Sse sees a no name in local and checks killboard - we see that this person was involved in killing Customs Office in 4GQ... A minute later we see Erebus on scan. Morale is up. Erebus has not jumped out after all. The person joins TEST and Erebus disappears. We quickly figure out that he is trying to move char + titan to Test probably after buying it...
---
Act 3
---
We are still not sure why Erebus appeared and disappeared so we check locator Agent. At this point we know char joined TEST AND Erebus is still in 4GQ.  We know where he is going to appear when he logs back in. Dezigan - hero of Stain, quickly sets up DeathStar POS at that location without forgetting to setup multiple POS webs. At this point nobody actually expects him to log back in today but the POS plus T2 bubbles are there and we hope to get lucky.
---
&lt;2 hours later:  
---
Grand Finale
---
Nicho Sse undocks in Astero and warps to POS to chat with Dezigan and likely swap him. Just as he does so Erebus logs back in and lands in our bubbles, with POS Death Star right there.  As usually happens in situations like this - we were not exactly ready once we got him tackled :). Second Primary undocks Stain standard issue suicide dread and proceeds to warp to Dezigan who is at 0 on titan. Second Primary is shooting alone while titan is in bubbles and being webbed and shot by POS. Obviously pings go out everywhere but we know that we have 8-10 minutes max before D-P Fax team can make it to 4GQ. MooseArmy has a few Faxes in range of 4GQ but we know they will not jump alone. Dezigan reships and warps back in but ends up too far and lights cyno anyway. Titan has to die quickly AND he is nearly out of bubbles despite POS webs. Our heavy dictors are finally on him and Soichiro in Sabre lights second cyno at 0 on him. Good Sax, Wreckticals and our beloved Literally The Worst Community guy ( we know you are alone there) jump in at optimal on him and he finally melts. 
---
Overall camp was &lt;2 hours. As usually happens in situations like this we were a little lucky but also very prepared to tackle him and keep him there long enough. Overall he died in about 7 minutes which means he was impossible to save from D-P but could have potentially lived if MooseArmy jumped in their Faxes from D-F. I would not call this a good fight. This was a proper gank though.
---
Nice. Another bot aspirant dealt with.
---
A single US TZ SIG deploying close to our allies WANGS and attempting to get fights out of them.

I went ahead and applied to Dreddit, so we'll see if i get accepted! Thanks for the advice, hopefully ill see you in game soon!

I wish. But nope, everyone was logged in long before the fight. The only "log in" was said once, by the other someone, in the context of "all dreads jump, titans log in".

That stilletto was great haha
---
I ship a lot of stuff. 1500 isk/ m3 plus 1% collateral. Test is a nice place for jf pilots to make isk.
---
I'm gonna try this tonight against rats but wanted to ask some PvP vets who know the mechanics better than I.
---
My question is about guns and tracking speed.  I see there are a set of T2 gatling laser turrets that have much better tracking than the others.  If I'm in a fight and webbed though, does that tracking speed really matter?  I mean, we'll both be going so slow our angular velocity won't matter for tracking, right?  Is fitting the normal focused pulse lasers a better idea 99.99% of the time?
---
My current pvp vni fit does 773  guns and drones.  Reps 209 hp/s.  RIP vni
---
So, these questions are pretty general, but I'm curious to hear people's thoughts on them.  I am pondering getting back into EvE for the first time since 2011 (had been playing since 2006).  I'm starting to do some reading, but it is a lot to catch up on.
---
So the two main questions:
---
* What are the biggest gotchya changes that I should know about?  I mainly did the high-sec PvE (with some low sec ninja mining) thing, so mostly wondering what has changed there.
---
* Are there any particularly good or interesting high-sec regions to set up in?  All the people I knew are long gone, so nothing in particular to keep me where I am outside moving lots of ships and junk.  Not all that concerned about ISK/hour, more want to see and do new things without dieing a whole bunch.
---
* Is there currently a good newbie training path? Something to ease someone back into the game?  Or would just going back to L1 missions be the best bet?
---
The number one thing you can do is to keep your citadel fueled. If I see a single low power structure in a low class wormhole, I'm going to evict it solo for the potential loot inside. Otherwise, you're not big enough and too much of a hassle for larger corps to invest time and effort in kicking you out.
---
im in tears holy shit haha

Admittedly "Eventually we swapped back to hazing some final dreads and faxes, a few more machariels, and fucked off with our load spent" is a long shout from "eventually we run out of dreads and retreated from the battlefield with the subcaps, leaving a few of them behind to die and letting the other side to loot uncontested"... But then again, according to goons it wasn't about winning, but about getting content. Getting shot at is also content, so they had gotten exactly what they came for. Win-win for everyone.
---
I was more referring to their pilots. I tried running with them after i resubbed but having to read or listen to what some of them take as a given (for example "you can't run a TPPH with 5 Logi" ) is just... ewww. Good thing i don't need the isk as much as i used to and Invasions are more fun tbh.
---
What in the fuck are you on about?
---
Nice meme, upventured
---
ha ha hhaa...aww...my leshak :/
---
Found the guy in a c4
---
You were assuming leadership in a visible public way.  You protected a pro-mission troll and gave them a platform to obstruct argument.  I disagreed with the way you were running the operation and executed a political hit on you to force you to make changes.  It was also entertaining to do so.  Welcome to the game.
---
Lost in this is that other players who were anti-mission couldn't start the conversation about what they were most concerned about because of the platform you gave to MAGA.  This is lost input and votes.  There was material damage done to our mutual interests by that choice, and I didn't do that damage.
---
No shit.
---
And why ? what the point of invading a null sec constel / region if you can't afford to mine their moon ? what the interest of a renter ? they act like an automated moon mining already but more dumb, i want more war not a bunch of spodbrain sucking their rock everyday

As in large homosexuals?.. Opposed to small gays of Goons, and medium gays of PL? And petite indian gays of lowsec? Nowadays even FRAT has the "I-too-am-gay" meme on full blast - and that is an alliance mainly from the country where being gay is a crime...
---
*Provides no advice in place of*
---
Afaik goku means just tanky bombers with logi. 
---
Stuka is the same as above with some booshers added. Goku was invented by tapi, init took that concept, added booshers and called it stuka fleet. (because dive bombers)
---
Now everybody is using stukas, even tapi, but they still call it goku fleet.
---
They should add depth charge bombs that do this instead.
---
Listen, it’s ambiguous for a reason
---
Take it as you will
---
So I never heard of broken window syndrome before so I looked it up...
---
 The **broken windows** theory is a criminological theory that states that visible signs of crime, anti-social behavior, and civil disorder create an urban environment that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. 
---
So is he trying to say that because it looks broken it makes people break it more? WTF, I do not get the reference he is going for,  maybe someone can explain? The entire reason FW is broken is because they ignored FW for years.. Then they decided to use FW as a test ground for Fozzie Sov and never did anything beyond that..
---
The reason FW ia brown is because the developers made it that way. You guys completely ignored it then turned it into farmville..
---
In Horde, we have goku bombers and use booshers. I guess we copied Init’s improvements but kept Test’s name
---
Yes. As we only support intercourse between consenting adults.
---
nothing like making your ship warp sideways lol
---
get owned dinotards
---
Yeah, i guess a lot of alliances maybe had goku doctrines before, and instead of renaming the modified version they just kept the name and added booshers to the doctrine to avoid confusion
---
on that real shit
---
Did an alt earlier in the month. 750k SP from referal. 1/2 price Omega for a month, 1 million Sp for $4.99. So for around $12 got month of omega, 1 million Sp, 750k SP from referal. Plus all the free Sp given out in the last week. Not bad. Oh an accelerator of +3 for 30 days that stacked with the accelerators they just gave out.

---
It may surprise you, but some of the biggest fights in FW used to happen before anyone was fighting over systems.. Yes the system flipping mechanic was always there but hardly anyone fought in plexes..
---
We used to just roll around and look for fights be it solo or in a gang.. Large gang fights of 20-40 ships per side use to happen simply because we were looking for fights not because we were forced to shoot some iHub..
---
Yeah.... it's not even fun music. 
---
Fuck all that shit.
---
Felt like poeple were starting to feel sorry for poor nico and his bubbling skills..
---
You already can. Use the arrow keys to manually control your ship. Switch into first person view (left side of your capacitor) if you want to. I prefer tracking my one ship for a 3rd person view when manually piloting like this (hit c, then click on your ship).
---
Oh, you can? Okay, thanks. Is it possible to change it from arrow keys to WASD?
---
I have some highly Unique Caldari builds that i made a series about look for them soon o7  
---
hope you guys are all enjoying the art  
---
i wanted to try and keep this one clean and make sure the Leader of the Caldari was in it.  
---
thanks for all the love and support look for my streams next month as life just has me busy ATM so all i can do is my art and the edits Cheers !!
---
He died so that a lowsec gate could live
---
Probably, check the key bindings in settings. Those keys are currently being used by other stuff though. Like approach and orbit I believe.
---
' The reward of FW is just not good enough to join for the average player compared to not joining and shooting at twice as many people. '
---
Actually back when there was about 500 active fw pilots per faction online all the time it was incredibly beneficial to get some allys rather than try to be a pirate and get your head smashed in by the militias. True statement.
---
Yes this is the extra spin version, but probably the more entertaining version ^_^
---
I'm not entirely sure [you'll miss us](https://i.imgur.com/vTVjCpe.png) but appreciate the sentiment. o7 fly safe out there. :)
---
OK. Have it your way mate. If you don't like the way I run things bye Felicia.
---
But you are beatiful...  in the inside.
---
Oh, okay. Thanks! I didnt think they had it because most games use WASD
---
Eve is weird, but have fun and good luck!
---
Ive run a fair few frigate fleets, here’s a few pieces of advice:
---
1. Having everyone be mwd fit is usually the best choice for small gangs. The power of frigates is in speed and you want to be able to ramboi susceptible targets quickly (like kite cruisers, squishy dessies, things with bad tracking like battleships)
---
2. Having damps or tds on a dedicated ship is not as effective when everyone else is going to be ramming the targets close range. Damps are useless if everyone is brawling the target and tds are mitigated if the target has webs. I suggest slapping some tds in the spare midslots of some of your ships instead and have more dps. Effective use of a dedicated ewar frig requires good piloting and positioning. When people bring random rag tag frigate gangs into my area I usually delete all their ewar off field before they even realise what’s happening.
---
3. Blueballing people is a key strategy to force a good fight. If the opponents undock something that’s too hateful (multiple rapid light ships) warp off over and over but remain visible. Once their balls are blue enough someone will be like “tackle them with a ceptor” and then you kill the ceptor and leave.
---
4. Check everyone’s fits before leaving (assuming that you’re not just giving out fits). Suggest that people buy 2 of the frig they’re flying. Having a spare helps to keep morale up if they die and also encourages ballsy maneuvers (you’re in cheap ships you should be a little ballsy).
---
5. Aim for isk efficiency. It’s unlikely you’ll get a good long prolonged fight in this comp. likely success will come from ramming a high value target, so you should know which targets are good for this. For example suiciding on Kikis is usually a great idea since they cost 200mil for even a cheap fit and they’re squishy. 
---
6. Have fun. Frigate fleets are some of my favourite because of the cheap nature and the awesome killmails you can get. 
---
If you want helps with fits, tactics or just want to chat about it, hit Dato Koppla up in game with a mail.
---
Nice, You guys bought a titan, joined test then killed it. You guys can't fight test so you resort to this? lol
---
I remember back in 2006, me and a friend used to walk to our local computer hardware store and buy 50 or 100 day GTC's, (Game time cards). the 50 days went for 150m and the 100 day ones for 300. 
---
We didn't have the 30 day cards in that store but I know they were available elsewhere as I saw them going for 90m on the forums.
---
&gt; Each and Every Star
---
*laughs in Katia Sae*
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I guess my main concern is that I fly us into a gang of dessies or Light misile cruisers, both of which seem to be common comps now days.
---
Agree whole heartedly with the reply im posting on, but i'd like to say its your job as FC to not just feed to a direct hard counter.
---
Don't try to rush a caracal fleet of comparable size, don't try to chase down MWD orthros with an AB frigate fleet, etc.
---
Your job, is to analyze the situation, and make a decision as to if/when you engage.
---
This is not to take away from the point that Havoc made, the point of the game is to have fun/make explosions.  However, time is valuable and there is no sense pissing away a whole fleet to take a fight you can basically never win.
---
This guy stands down. Many of us would rather welp than go without content. Just sayin.
---
At the time it was.
---
cool
---
Aurum and PLEX got merged so there is only one cash shop currency. Now you only have PLEXes to pay and 500 of them are worth a months subscription! 
---
Don't get baited paying 2bil ISK for 1 PLEX, its a scam!
---
Jita is the main Tradehub in the game, get there and make it your home so you have access to all materials and shit you need!
---
Just wait till she sees the overview setup. That's a make or break moment right there
---
Lasers have the shittiest tracking there is, usually Blasters are best followed by Autocannons!
---
In PvP if you're in the slower ship its best to not orbit your enemy just double click into space and fly straight, if you're faster you want to orbit!
---
If you're very close you have high angular velocity and so Sanshas ships for example can fuck your day up pretty bad. Webs help for sure but then there are ships like the brawler Svipul for example that work very well while being double webbed ^ffs since they still kinda speedtank you and can dictate ranges.
---
Nice mate!
---
If you guys are into the whole roleplaying aspect of DnD, there is a rp community in EVE as well. Eve lore is really rich and interesting. Pm me if you guys want to check it out and i'll shoot you some links :)
---
Welcome back!
---
Don't make me hard like that.
---
Well, 2 days ago you only had 4 days to claim so you won't get all 7 days worth...
---
If you stick with T1 exploration frigs and go wormhole diving for relic &amp; data sites, you should be able to make enough isk to comfortably cover any losses you incur along the way. Even a crappy site will net you 10-30m.
---
&gt; Is there some sort of "rule" where you try to not undercut your corp mate on the market
---
Ruthlessly undercut them. If they cry to leadership or line members that you're taking their profit by lowering prices, all the non-market people in the corp will shit on them.
---
WASD already do things, try undocking in space and press buttons to see what they are bound to, you might find them useful enough to leave manual piloting controls on the arrow keys.
---
You sound like you harbor mean feelings towards NC. Please point on the caracal where the big bully touched you.
---
&gt; Aurum
---
Heh.  I had to look that one up, I think the store and aurum were introduced after I had left.  Good to know how PLEX has changed though.
---
Also good to hear that Jita is still the main hub, though personally I always preferred the regional mission hubs since people burn through lots of consumables there.
---
23:00 UTC is 4pm on the West coast of the US and 7pm on the East coast, so pretty solid in USTZ.  
---
Meanwhile, it is nearly midnight and after in EUTZ.  Late for a weeknight.
---
i think you missunderstand.
---
I don't consider pointlessly chasing a mwd orthros in AB frigates as our whole fleet dies needlessly to be "content".
---
I'm just saying don't take fights with immediate hard counters that you stand no chance of winning against. I'm all for the "good fight"
---
T1 Frigates, Destroyers and Cruisers.
---
Not because they are cheap but because of how many more people will be willing to engage you in them. For learning the best thing you can do is get in as many fights as you can. Blingy faction/pirate ships will scare off alot of potential pilots.
---
First thing I'd do is figure out what kind of PvP you'd like to do (Kiting, Brawling, Scram Kiting, etc.) Then find a hull and fit that fits your role buy 10-30 of them and move them to your staging. I suggest a hull that you can fit in many ways effectively such as a Tristan or Atron, of course buy the fits for both brawling and kiting. This way if you get tired of brawling for a day you can go kite around.
---
Once you have everything in your staging all that is left is to undock and start finding fights. Your Kill to Death ratio doesn't matter at this stage (or any stage really) it's all about the learning. Record your fights if you can, after each fight try to walk through the steps you took, what worked, what didn't, why did you die, why did they die and not you, were you able to apply dps, were they, the list goes on... 
---
The faster you can get fights the better the learning will occur. Once you feel comfortable start adding bling and buying all the expensive things you want. 
---
**or just buy the ship you think is the coolest looking and die in it a ton until you learn that way**
---
Flairbaiting is a time honored tradition of the North. It confuses the enemy and occasionally results in much laughter.
---
Just a note a bee hitting a spacecrafts windshield moving at 10% the speed of light would release about 45GJ of energy.  that would probably put a few cracks in it.
---
wait are frat russians?
---
i'm still comming to terms that NC. does actually know how to press the undock button.
---
Never would have happened if there was a low sec exit from Stain.
---
Don't forget the myrm. Blasters, scram, web, dual cap booster or dual web, and either double or triple rep. Very engagable, and can pretty easily kill whatever has you scrammed if you want to slap an MJD on there for an easy escape. Also doesn't really matter if you DO escape after insurance.

Holy shit I went on a road trip and forgot about this event.

1b citadel for 15b super, I’d make that trade every day of the week.  It is ridiculous how powerful medium citadels are for the cost though.
---
Watch Jebi.
---
Make the choice to not fly cancer. Cancer will just make you good at one thing because of a suboptimal mechanic, it does the opposite of you teaching you to think about your PVP and how to survive and turn a bad situation into one that is survivable.
---
Start with Frigates. Tristan + Firetail + Slicer and when you are getting good, Rifter.
---
Then start with asymmetric fits. Set hard challenges for yourself. Make yourself learn to fit and fly something that people would tell you you are doing it wrong if they see the fit.
---
Start winning with asymmetric fits and build a reputation for it, then when someone fights you they will worry a lot more.
---
Anyone can win with numbers, always consider that a loss or an irrelevance. It will never help you become good at solo and trains you to not problem solve.
---
Then when you are ready, start flying bling. Bling is not about the stats advantage - which can very rarely help - but it is about the shame as a motivator to not die. Isk efficiency is for poors - the cost of you 200m fit t1 frigate is actually worth it if you know how to farm because the time efficiency of your PVP time is multiplied and more enjoyable. But you need to stress about dying and suffer consequence of loss. Make yourself have to fly back to Jita or Amarr to reship. Make it hurt and be painful. Make the Isk loss hurt.
---
When you start getting good with a fit - reward your ship. Every 5 kills buy it an upgraded module. Carrot and stick.
---
Build a deep emotional attachment to individual ships. Cry over their loss, be angry and overreact. Use your full intellect and emotional intelligence to help push you to put everything you have into not dying in every fight. Become a crazed yet meticulously planning pvp'er. This is how you become a little bit scary for solo pvp.
---
Also just ignore everyone who needs alts or friends to fight you. They are trash tier pvp'ers. There is a lot of them. Real solo pilots know who the others are and respect them.
---
I downloaded it off Youtube so it could never go missing. I am not an old enough character to really know the PL vs BL fights ect but damn I love a good rage video.

JeffRaider sounds like the man though

wow that's an amazingly shit rate for how arduous and risky it is with huge collateral.

You can easily make 5x-10x that in goons with an appropriately sized JF fleet (you can basically fill any number of jump freighters)

---
You mean polished the hull?
---
"For example, Systems on the Frontline could have their broker fees just eliminated. Or have their industry jobs have their installation costs eliminated and their material costs reduced."
---
You could leverage quite a lot of the existing system upgrade mechanics into this idea, relating it back to proximity to the front line.
---
Offering?
---
Can hit 2k with a tank fit confessor and an ab
---
In my opinion DO make it easy for blobs.
---
Blobs are the retention factor for Eve.
---
You're either in one or wishing you could have been when you die to one.
---
If you're not in one, make one.
---
Sufficiently tanked it can.
---
Doesn't work if roaming out if a wormhole though.
---
It's a short timer, 2 min? It's when you initiate warp that starts the timer, not when you land on grid. I've made that mistake. I've also initiated warp, cancelled cause I forgot something and landed on grid right as it blew.

Thanks for fleet Eldwinn

thx 4 fleet eldwinn
---
Some good points but it kinda pisses me off when people that “haven’t played in 2-3 years” feel it necessary to say “EVE is dying”  
---
Either play the game or go away and let the people that play this awesome fucking game have fun
---
What are you wearing eldwinn?!
---
Tribute got glassed but don't think much is going on currently.
---
Thanks for the fleet Eldwinn
---
is there a tl;dr to this?
---
uh....honestly nothing.
---
tribute got glassed in a blueball war of no noteworthy fights(and lots of mad hordelings who deployed, only to find the FCs never calling fleets to do anything)
---
and the TAPI vs Frat war....which is....uh....not really doing much.  mostly just shooting with nothing of note happening.  i think test winning the isk war?  kinda hard to tell as neither side seems to be seriously pushing
---
...but will it cook a chicken?
---
being able to eventually hit 2k in a straight line with an overprop doesn't make it an effective solo fit - for really any purpose, and especially not for a training platform
---
a tank fit confessor really doesn't tank much at all, cap is probably bad, dps is definitely bad, turns like an aircraft carrier, takes forever to get to speed.   
---
it's not a good solo ship at all.   
---
It's easy to make the mistake of treating t3d's as if they can have all three modes on at once - they can't and typically any given fit is meant to be flown in one mode almost all of the time.
---
Just read the "the goal" part I guess
---
thanks for the post, i really really enjoyed this post
---
I can see your point, but the problem is the current state of the game is not healthy. I am sure some people have fun escalating to titans all day but that is not what brings in new players. Which is critical to keeping the game alive.
---
If you change the starting skills, the "minimum viable skills" will be moved as well.
---
Personally I think everyone should start out with 0 sp, and buff everything by the starter skills. For example, with cpu management (5% cpu per level), you would increase all ships cpu output by 20% (current starter level of 4), and change the skill to 1% cpu per level, while also matching the level 0 -&gt; 5 sp to the current 4 -&gt; 5 sp.
---
I've played eve for around 13 years. It has had it's ups and downs. Don't worry too much.
---
Id say use shield instead of armor. Mwd atrons with shield ext are highly effective especially in lowsec. Same for the rifters. 
---
Will you even bring logi? T1 frigates are very fragile. Also avoid caracals and ONI's. Even destroyers could be hard sometimes.
---
Honestly do you think a new player know what to do? Think when you started this game, you probably had a friend or researched a ton before you got a firm grasp on things. Starting with the recommended skills just gets people into the action. Which is all people care about in games. Obviously the min viable skills would need to be adjusted to account for this aswell.
---
Hmm yeah baby show me them skill points!
---
I hope so. We can lose our ships on the same fleet some time!
---
That was fun tanking mouth breathers for over an hour, god bless the cheap tank dread meta
---
God bless you wally for tanking more than most Titans in nullblocs can &lt;3
---
When you have the gaze of god on your back, anything is possible.

fucking hilarious fight, that was wild. Rasta's "YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS" on comms when he boated out of the bubbles and jumped his dread out was legendary  
---
the sacrifice of anure and valencia resieging in the line of fire to yeet the tackle off their comrades so they could yump to safety will never be 5gotten
---
Bless you Jesus. You will let us rise again like you did after your respawn timer.
---
I agree with almost everything you wrote.  The phrase “EVE is Dying” really triggers me.  A lot of people come here to see if they should give the game a try or learn something and negativity is bad for the game.
---
Anure and Valencia died for our sins
---
That meme existed from the start, like literally a year after the game was out. My apologies though if it was trigging a bit, that was not my intentions. Being giving a bad wrap about the game. I mean I played the game I think like 10 years or something. However from a company standpoint CCP is not doing great. They are losing developers, downsizing, and enduring multiple failures on their other games.
---
Oh nice, thanks! Could you post a shot of your character in it by any chance? I've never seen it in-game besides the market preview thing. It's good to hear it's actually in the game and not a placeholder.
---
Those are buy orders. Arrange buy orders by highest and sell orders by lowest.

Yes dev’s have left that you were probably familiar with,  but they have also hired a ton of great talent and are continuing to add awesome people.   Your write up shows you care about the game and your write up would be taken more serious without using a “Meme that has always been around”.

Almost nothing has changed in terms of high sec missions really.
---
Marauders are pretty different with bastion but not crazy so
---
Where abouts in high-sec are you mining? I wouldn't bother going to 0.0, with the nullsec blackout currently in effect, Local in null is effectively in delayed mode, meaning, like in WH space, you won't see who is in local until they type something. You'll likely end up getting ganked constantly.
---
GF to all sides, was a fun fight! The spontaneity of how this fight escalated is the classic magic of Eve.
---
What type of corp should I join as a new player if I want to make a lot of ISK?
---
I like wolf , fire tails, harpy’s, Sabre , broadsword, eagles , tengu, Loki, proteus was a beast but it’s crap now , astero and the stratios , love the dreadnaught, and super can be fun roam too if you if have the cojones , and  be willing ready to let go of all ships you fly.
---
Oh and sb ,s hound and manticores.... can be fun too , 
---
See you can solo in all of these but they all have different applications, 
---
My next thing I can’t wait to learn is the new vni 🤗

Not listening to "amateurs" csm people doesn't mean that the "pro"/"expert" null csm would get anything correct on their own.

What wars?

Enjoy the game how you want, bud. 
---
If you're gunning to grind isk up as a low sp guy, mining is one way to get your initial isk. PI is good because you'll get passive income and it scales...to a point. Dont forget to look at exploring and doing relics/data, and maybe entertain the idea of ratting.
---
Some people might say you're spreading too thin but if you're feeling out the game, why not do everything and try it.
---
Market trading and manufacturing/indy in general is where you make high investment + good returns.
---
I made my first billion isk running 12 alts in a p1 &gt; p4 setup, it was glorious but oh man, it turned into just hauling all day. which btw, is a good isk maker too with the right crowd.
---
Play eve how you wanna play, you'll get around to shooting spaceships eventually but dont let them haters hate on the isk grind fun.

why not both

Nullsec is at war with Highsec because Drifter NPCs had the unmitigated gall to tickle some structures and pop some nerds.
---
Follow verybad’s very good advice and have a blast in frigs around the FW war zone, then when you get the hang on manual piloting and module management, get something like a Jaguar, Kiki or faction cruiser such as the scythe fleet/osprey navy, and go enjoy the blackout in Null
---
Added one just for you babe.
---
Thanks!
---
well, maybe he simply forgot where his character was XD
---
And referring acc gets 350 plex
---
Lawl.  Those armor plates , ones he learns an astero can make you billions!
---
I feel that anyone that ends up in a Plex is there because they want to have fun and fight. I don't see any reason why standings need to go away.
---
Proposal: no standings losses while on grid with a plex. Also, warp stabs similarly don't work while on grid with a plex. I don't see either of these as too hard/unreasonable.
---
well, ihubs are flipped. So currently it's not a stalemate (since ihub flipping disallows cyno jammers for at least a month, I think)
---
Although, it's in slow-mode.
---
Way easier doing it for a NS alliance imo, I don’t even bother with seeding markets, just people’s personal requests. People want stuff, lots of stuff, every goddamn day.

I've never fucked with POSes beyond being in them, but if it's a small tower, 10 blocks per hour, 5 years is \~43,200 hours, which means 432k blocks.  At current prices on Evepraisal of 20k ISK per block, that's \~8.6b ISK to keep the POS up the whole time.
---
Tragically, the bus pilot would have needed to wait roughly 55 years before going ISK positive.
---
Wait, free SP for NPCing? Oh Christ, hear me now.
---
Call down grandpa, my avatar still has large rigs :)

Haha that might be worth something to some weirdo collector ))

I’m just bitter because I like putting them on cruisers.
---
Out of interest, can you tank an itty to survive a tornado’s alpha? I’m dumb and know nothing about either ship.
---
Aren't you essentially invincible if the cyno is within the docking range of a lowsec station?
---
Near2 is bad for the game, don’t try and spin it otherwise.

I dont have a supercapital or titan and haven't set foot in anything with a jump drive and I'm having more fun in EVE right now than I've had in literal years.

Spammin that warp.

I think you will find we almost bombed you as well, we aimed at the rear of one of the carriers, and as we launched you all started landing. There was a simultaneous course of 'No's as we watch the bombed travel toward your fleet.
---
The arc can be drawn by putting a sharpy on your target and attach a piece of string to it and to your own ship. Now while holding tension on the piece of string draw a line down to the tactical grid. Your sharpy will draw dthe arc. All points on the arc have the same distance as between you and the target.
---
I agree !!
---
This makes the arc part of a circle with you at the centre.
---
&gt; but you'll get farmed by pirates in bling kikimoras

Sounds great - bring it on.

(tbh - I have not seen any pirates in kikkis farming any one in fw.)

When I bought my aeon from Saranen when it was the PL hive I thought I was stupid for solo moving it. But it takes a special kind of retarded to jump a nyx to a system with combat probes and hics out.
---
This has always been a good idea but they also need to remove supers, titans and jump fatigue from fw space for it to really work.
---
FW groups will need to be able to re-deploy - jump fatigue stops this from being done efficiently (fw started to die the day it was introduced)
---
There is simply no need to have supers and titans in low sec. With a 'frontline system' they will be even more oppressive. Good luck ever flipping a system again if the shitlords easily know when and where to drop supers on every bash fleet without needing to really gather any intel.
---
Was out exploring once in my Astero, hit a ghost site. Got one can analyzed quickly, went for another as I thought I had plenty of time. As I went to the next one the Sleepers spawned and I hit warp to whatever I could find by right clicking. After turning and thinking I am dead I warped out with 1 tick left in structure.

These sexy ass rocket boats are easy to fly, have a large engagement profile, look hot as hell. blaster comets? Move over betty you're getting your duck sucked. Torments? Not a chance. Dual rep breachers? ... we don't talk about them.

For some easy cheap fun things, you could simply go with Caracals + Osprey/Scythes.

Those are kinda throwaway doctrines and can let you learn to fly together. :)

I guess that's why frat is evacing all their rorqs to drones tonight.

The main question is why would anyone extract while flying dirt cheap stelthbomber? Selfdestruct it and don’t waste time.
---
or if you wish that players that got it are only using it ... make it so that when reedemed instantly starts on some character - then no expiry date needed as item will never get onto the market.

Like CCP implemented those injectors so fast that you cannot even put them on the market as they don't exist in there.

Rocket condors with small neuts- fit an mwd and just ram boi into everything. You will be surprised how much shit you can catch and kill, and with enough small neuts you can shut down a lot of scary stuff. Added bonus they are so darn cheap if you welp no one gives a shit! 
---
An ab is nice but if you have a sizeable gang they are probably not going to scram everything anyway - and even if they do, the rockets will still apply on the edge of scram range. Just my opinion, but in a frigate blob speed is king so I would always use mwd in that situation.
---
.....why do these things ALWAYS happen near where I live when I am deployed?
---
Keep calm and fit a cyno. 
---
Someone shows up on your site? Hit the button and enjoy the fireworks.

Lots of reasons, I suspect.  While Omegas are good for current business they likely want to focus on trying to keep Alphas and/or entice them to upgrade.  Running events that give away precious SP, which they'd normally have to wait on and likely just switch off from, might help in that regard but only temporarily.  On the flipside, I can't really think of a better prize reward for an event.  What else could they give other than ships/items which become more undervalued when mass marketed, or are already readily available on the market?
---
you can inject the free sp into your main and then not use them till needed. they don't go bad there
---
goons went north, killed some citadels and left
---
that's pretty much the only 'war' recently
---
Sounds about right
---
That's pretty much the reality of sov warfare right now thanks to \*amazing\* CCP design decisions.  TEST vs FRT is going, but its slower than 2 turtles having intercourse because of said mechanics.
---
No local doesn't fix ANY of the problems associated with current sov warfare, sooo yeah
---
Still way too long and looks more like a rant about shit that pisses you off.
---
T1 Frigates in FW, Fights are quick, dirty, and the decisions you make are life and death because of how quick the fights are over. Get kiting, get scram kiting, get brawling.

Caldari navy Hookbils and Kestrels are good scram kiters.

Executioners and slicers are good kiters.

Would be about the same during the quiet times - Most fw groups keep assets deeper into their space and deploy near systems they wish to attack.
---
&gt;Blobs are the lifeblood of Eve.
---
Given that is basically all you have, why is the game dying?
---
&gt;Can you realistically expect fleets, large corps, alliances and coalitions to disband in response to your position?
---
Why do you think that is the same thing as designing the game to encourage what is killing it?
---
&gt;The point of Eve is that it encourages groups to band together to overcome complex objectives that would not be possible alone.
---
More like they gang up so they dont have to take as much risk and get a shitty KB.
---
&gt;It would be a pretty damn boring game if everyone beloved they should go it alone... Ironically, THAT would cause the game to die much more quickly.
---
The game is a glorified chat at this point. I guess you can make an argument that it keeps it alive, but the space is quite empty.
---
the pucker is real. 1% is all you need
---
Blobs cause stalemate as you see in null, they also limit choice.
---
I hope you have [this spreadsheet with all the rat damage in WH space.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml#)
---
How did the drifter end up killing you?
---
depends on what you do.
---
If your pvp mostly consists of large fleets, where you are dps, than 4 is enough.
---
But if you fly smallgang, or even specialized roles such as tackle webs, etc its pretty important. 
---
Also for abbys (higer tiers), or for running burners (maybe some other hig end pve)
---
Some modules you can overheat (like guns) even with low skills, but mwd's you can burn them out just in 2-3 cycles if your skills are bad enough.
---
Dude, great watch. Earned you a sub.
---
based on my skills it is like 40mill ehp tanked
---
Remaking or rebalancing capitals it's going to require a really huge effort from CCP. I hope they go ahead with it. I don't agree 100% with Falcon's view on some roles, BUT all of that is better than what the current situation is.
---
I've just started playing and I cannot wait to understand what all this means
---
Seagull ... I am not sure how big of a role she had in the way EVE turned. BUT things are slowly going into the right direction and somehow inline when she left.
---
protip: ifyou plan on refitting, be fitted for tank when you warp in, then refit for damage afterwards.
---
I don't like the idea of restricting how many people null can support because I can only see two options. Either you don't restrict it enough and you'll just see new borders being drawn and nothing will change for anyone but the hunters (slightly worse protection). Sure you might get some fights in the beginning but soon it will just turn stale like it is now.  
---
The other option is you restrict it too much and you get a war for land and the smaller entity will get pushed out because the balance of forces is too heavily skewed right now.  
---
In both these scenarios you will force anyone who wants to try null out to join a bloc.
---
I'd much prefer for CCP to make an effort to try to introduce new players into low and nullsec. Give NPC null corps more highsec agents and introduce more "questlines" that encourages people to go to null. Entice them with rewards if you have to. I only recently realized how many NPC corps that actually reside in null and never once when I used to be a highsec carebear did I learn of them. I only thought there were pirate npc corps in null.  
---
I wonder how many people ignore the pirate epic arcs just because they see that you need to go to null and how many would greedily take the jump if they'd knew how much money you make during it (relative  to highsec lvl 3 missions).
---
I also think creating a lot more routs from Highsec to nullsec would be good, right now taking the first step into nullsec is the most dangerous and instead of learning how to safely (relatively) travel in and to null they just keep away all together.
---
This is only one suggestion. There are so much more that can be done to get people to null but not forcing them to do so through Large nullsec entities. I would also want more things that get new people to try out lowsec and wormholes too. I think staying in highsec is the eve equivalent of not moving out of your parents house. It's ok to stay there when you're new and learning the game but you will never truly experience the life/game if you keep relying on you parents/CONCORD all the time.
---
As for how a bloc power like Panfam having a hard time staying relevant and how a new group could survive when an already established group is having a hard time. I think the problem is that your history is hampering you. A lot of people dislike you, something a new group wouldn't have against them.
---
I also don't think it's fair to compare a possible new group to Panfam because Panfam is in obviously in decline, only staying relevant thanks to Horde, but you haven't realized this until recently and are only now trying to do something about it. Moving to the dronelands might help alot eve though it wasn't completely voluntary.
---
A new group would be a lot more energetic and active, they'd be rising up against the system. As long as their struggles feel surmountable and the larger blocks don't just poke them  to death by accident.

Hilmar suddenly realised that both new players and people wanting alts would seriously benefit from more sp from the start, and the perception and subsequent disappointment of a new character being useless is killing retention.

HAW Dreads can easily track ships going over 450m/s depending on sig and positioning. LR Heavy and Light fighters do to.
---
I would suggest starting with armor buffer cruisers so you have less to manage (cap/modules) and die slow enough that you can figure out what's going on, then graduate to self-rep cruisers, then finally nano cruisers and after that you can probably get to battlecruisers, but start from the self rep, not buffer (as those are too slow)
---
&gt; I ship a lot of stuff. 1500 isk/ m3 plus 1% collateral. Test is a nice place for jf pilots to make isk.

People know my alts as a go to logi guy (I have two in separate alliances) so just mail me a list of what they need, or sometimes but it themselves and contract it to me. I do a trip every other day usually or quicker if I get a lot of orders and fill up. I pay for everything myself unless it’s a contract, and then my ally mate pays me when I deliver. I don’t charge any set amount of isk per m3, but people are incredibly over-generous with their isk usually. 
---
It’s not fun, it’s really quite boring but I think for a few hours work the boring:profit margin can’t be beaten. It’s very safe if you use the citadel network correctly, always have outcynos etc.

No local is a solution to there not being any guerilla style warfare. Asset safety makes any big war thats not emotion-based (ie grudge), or to get more renter space meaningless.

Frigates are also good because they're faster and it's thus easier to pick solo fights rather than end up food for bigger groups though.

Basically, some dudes were bored and flew around in big ships. The group attacking them was much larger but the 8 dudes held their ground and got a few of the big enemy ships.

My first solo kill was an newbie in Heron taken down by my combat scanning/PvP Heron. Shit felt amazing, I had no idea if I'll be able to catch him.

Thank you
---
I've always wished that security status was replaced with specific faction empire security standings for 'security status'. Gank someone in Caldari space? Lose Caldari Standings. That way you can be pirates who kill people in Caldari lowsec while still having full access to Gallente/Minmatar space such as Dodixie/Rens etc. And you could gain Caldari security standings from killing Guristas/Blood/Sansha. That way FW corps aren't punished for engaging neutrals behind enemy lines even outside of plexes, because they still can access their own area of highsec. 
---
It's the faction navies that hunt down -5 players in their space anyway not CONCORD. 
---
And you still have kill rights to get revenge. The Kill Right system currently doesn't work well because -5 players can be shot by anyone anyway, and suicide ganks are mostly conducted on alts. It only really is useful for 'killright scamming' or occasionally killing someone who doesn't realise he has a killright on him from a drunk roam or something. 
---
Could even have NPCs offering bounties on players who have very low standings to their faction who have been active recently, giving a killright and with the bounty placed being a small % of the damage they've caused. Perhaps only offered to players who have high standings to the faction offering it, and some level of randomization (like you get 3 out of x possible bounties shown to you each day) to prevent gaming it farming your alt.
---
Thanks for the feedback. Much appreciated :)
---
Luckily we both started launching defenders.

In wh, you will need an astero, a venture, maybe a drake.

---
Excuse me???
---

---
Renting in Period Basis costs 1b one time payment per corp.
---
I don't think renting is a laid back play style anymore now that local is gone. You need either a supercap umbrella or standing defense gangs to have any safety now, and you probably won't get those as a renter. 
---
But I've never been a renter so maybe I'm talking out of my ass.
---
this.
---
I recommend contacting Hard Knocks Inc. to rent a C6, you will make much much more ISK/HR and it’s super easy AND safe!
---
i recall there being a site, which listed, which WH sites were safe to explore and which had NPC-s in them, cant remeber the site tho...
---
Believe this is the 'zarvox' fit. Its very good to teach when to choose the right moment to pounce in and brawl, with added bonus that you have AB to maybe escape.
---
Faction/Pirate cruisers are lots of fun for someone like the OP. Alot of them can 'kite' with MWD around the edge of disruptor range by having good speed and agility.
---
In my time, have enjoyed and would recommend using OMEN NAVY ISSUE (Heavy Pulse Lasers with Ancil armor rep) as it has similar paper DPS as the ScyFI (worse tracking, so mind transversal but with more rewarding fly style.
---
I once got killed by a 10 mil bait her on in my 120 mil in my astero...never felt so dumb
---
This is eve. If I wanted a safe nanny state, I wouldn’t escape reality by playing eve.
---
I dont get why people rent in 2019, you can just join one of the blocs and do some fleets while enjoying their space &amp; infrastructure.
---
Wormholes are the new safe krab areas now.
---
You will get more fights and more even matchups flying frigs and destroyers in lowsec than bigger stuff which is what you want when learning.
---
Was probs Pinky.
---
Ya I agree the other day I got rolled into by a PvP group while I was putting 15b of caps in a site and they didn’t even manage to tackle me lol! I feel so incredibly safe so glad I don’t have to make ISK in a panic fit rorq AND remember to use my cyno! I was thinking about using a super with some sebo’s but aligning sounds kinda hard while using Dscan so yeah I dunno think I’ll just keep doing this!
---
Anyone else try the duel medium ancil probe in FW space? The thing is hilarious. Reps like a beast. If you can find a way to buff the resist a little so your tank doesn’t get completely alpha’ed through it’s actually a viable choice for some lol’s
---
Lmao goons can't fight a competent titan group. We worked hard for those titans, glad to see ourbinsy group paid off!
---
Which alliance is offering that deal? Also what limitations are there? Can a Corp rat/mine anywhere? Do they get access to moon mining etc?
---
I think your and our definition of a blob is different.
---
My definition of a blob would be any group that has an unreasonable numbers advantage compared to the groups that it fights. That could be a 50-man fleet in lowsec, or it could be groups that form 2000 characters to shoot at an undefended keepstar in nullsec. It could also be a 150 man fleet in nullsec, attacking a group that can't form more than 50 for whom backup will not come.
---
Groups are the retention factor for EVE, blobs... not so much.
---
Goons. Not 100% sure which moons are off limits, but besides that the only limitation is the lack of sov mod for capital construction.
---
"actually learning the mechanics to use them to my advantage was too hard so i blobbed up"
---
I've seen the name stukas used more often recently. 
---
Wasn't there a slapfight between brisc and progod about which fleet concept was older?

---
Why waste time make wars when blue all do trick?
---
Nice try ccp, I'm not going to send you my recording of  the bonus rooms.
---
What people are trying to say, is that having a hauling alt, is a good idea in the game anyway. So doing it for FW, and we advice people to role a indy alt all the time in militia chat, is a good thing.
---
Tell that to nullsec
---
Hardly notice the effect of them on the skills im training 😪
---
No no, what you'll have is a few systems that end up getting controlled by the largest local pirate force, who then log on their farming alts, to see-saw the contested between 70-90% and max out the LP gains. 
---
You're ignoring the main point which is about the issues in faction welfare being economic. While I understand that every game has issues with the player base making things as boring as possible by min-maxing (water will always find a crack). 
---
Also this won't stop the mission farmers, which is where the real LP is. The plex farmers/bots are merely and irritation in comparison to the multi-boxing neck-beards diluting the LP worth in i-stabbed Jackdaws.
---
Np bud )
---
Then you've never been anywhere near Amamake. Or you're being deliberately obtuse.
---
So... Possibly stupid question; would it be possible to scale LP paid into the deferred account by the rank (higher rank, more LP into the deferred payout?), that way a newish player would be able to make some LP and quickly convert it to ISK when starting in factional warfare. The longer they've been doing FW the higher the chance they have enough ISK to support themselves (the less they rely on instant LP payouts)
---
&gt;It killed me for science, after I finished the site.
---
Can't wait to be able to become a one-man-army. Stories like this is what makes me strive to get better at EVE
---
To be honest if this info is correct it sounds more like they pay a one off membership fee rather then actual renting. Also sounds like a great deal - as a comparison BOT are charging a minimum 2.5 Billion PER MONTH for access to Malpais!
---
Just join goons if you're a renter. Go on a fleet a month for pap, done
---
can confirm, good pro tip... also, make sure you have a mobile depot as well... another pro tip.
---
My heron is either double medium ancil or med ancil + med ext but I will also consider the probe!
---
The reason it exists is to draw renters from other rental space to drive down other alliances income.

I think i know what youre trying to say... maybe..

successful drops do happen in delve and around the game. It takes planing and people willing to put their dick and assets on the table. The average eve player is lazy and extremely risk adverse. the avg highsec pubbie in bombers Bar doesn't want to set up, plan and then execute that plan. they want to come to delve in a 50m stealth bomber and frag out. Without a counter. What is the counter to 150 stealthbombers, they melt a carrier is under one minute a super in five to seven?
---
A 50m stealth bomber isnt risk, like everyone else its risk adverse. Then when they fail to kill something they cry to ccp.. This is to strong, that is to strong. A Cyno inhibs take 30seconds to drop. cov cyno cant be seen. on top of that you have the best dps subs in the game kikis/drekavacs or even Leshaks yet for the most part the same groups crying over umbrella strength dont bring these. Why? They're risk adverse...
---
I would venture to say dreadbombs are 90% effective at killing what they dropped on.

this right here. join K-fleet! double SRP and all of goon space to live in. or join the swarms renting alliance i think its only 1b a month.

Imagine being such a spodbrain that someone who won't literally give you the source code the second you ask for it must be harvesting your data instead.

I swear, Eve is just full of paranoid fuckheads.

Thanks senpi for noticing me!
---
I think you should add here some amount of PLEX to have someone nearly constantly be watching this POS. At least before Alphas this character needed to be paid regularly. 
---
I’m not sure if watch lists could help here: when titan logs in it will be bumped out of pos shields and fly away pretty fast. If it happens when no one logged in there is a big chance that titan will get away.
---
I might be totally wrong here for sure.

If there is a pirate faction name in it it is safe to explore, otherwise it is not :D

Why does the "asset safety prevents wars" meme still exist? Asset safety is already partial in k-space. You can get a ton of loot by shooting structures.

oh yes it deserves  it  as do you.

I love how there's just random guy in a Condor.
---
Renting systems in blackout up is wrong. You will lose monies to camping **PRO** pvp players. Right now Taxed or regional access works way better.
---
You dont know who is scannig u at moment is it friend or foe so taxed system will prevent you from losing but will probably limit maximum income still better then paying up front.
---
The API endpoint for skills is read-only. There is no way to update your skill queue outside of the game client.
---
I havn't been there for a long time. I am commenting from what I see mostly in Black Rise.
---
There is a lot more to low sec than the single system Amamake. Creating conflict with a change like this really can't hurt if CCP try it. It isn't like things are thriving atm.

Goons came out of it stronger than ever before and we are now BFF's with TEST again.

The Triple Masb is only viable in null due to poor range control. Good for memeing big stuff, but be sure to fit a Nos.

Double Masb might work in low, but it still has limited range control (only 1 web + slow).

 Dualweb with TD is the way to go.

some systems used to be rented out for much more than that..... some systems rent for 10-12B a month in some old rental alliances it all comes down to what you have access to.
---
The BOT system isnt bad from what i have read,  you have access to lots of systems instead of just 1,  also you will be under the Panfam umbrella which most rental alliances dont seem to have..
---
damn, im jealous.
---
Goku has been a doctrine for longer than Command Destroyers have existed.
---
Only takes a few hours to train up a neutral alt to haul for you.  It should be the first thing your corpmates tell you when you join FW.  
---
Then you never have to bother going into highsec, until your neutral alt spots a wartarget dumb enough to be doing missions/hauling/mining/etc.
---
Nah.  At least PanFam, Legacy, and DeadCo are in on it to.  Not sure re: Frat.
---
Yeah I went ahead and applied, so we'll see if I get accepted!
---
Ganking is not warfare, its just ganking. No local does shit to promote any warfare, in fact it straight up makes offensive warfare go slower.
---
And asset safety doesnt do shit since you can move most stuff ahead of time. Its not like people dont have spies and that killing a structure doesnt require multiple timers. 
---
Space being to big and not enough people to fill it is what makes wars meaningless, simply not enough reason to fight if you can just move (amongst other things).

After the creation of the account, did you receive immediately the offer for 1/2 price Omega for a month or took some time?
---
An Orca can do the MWD+cloak. 
---
Maybe adjust the MWD or your timing. For me, it's 3/4 through its cycle when I deactivate cloak on an account and 4/5 on another. Depends on fit, pilot skills, fat fingers.
---
Wormholes I hear are the new casual places that krabs can live.

I do not know B0T's fate, but as long as they're not shoved in to Germinate I'd recommend that. No one else will allow you to live in their umbrella that I know of.

Also, killmarks.

Whelp, that's sorta what's goin on in here haha.
---
Maybe the new players of eve are stupid. I studied about the game weeks in advance before playing and when I got in it wasnt that crazy to find a corp and get the proper skills training. Then all I had to do is learn from first hand experience.
---
I see what you did there, Camping, Pro and PVP in the same sentence......
---
The addition of "yeet" to this thread invalidates any possible coolness. Sad faces all around.

You can bling if you really want, but this is a fit that's purely for a dude to learn in so idk why you would care to.

It already has an absurd tank and is cap stable so... Who cares?

Did hilmar suddenly start playing the game or something?
---
what is your target?
---
to fight and yolo - fight everything
---
to get a good fight? whats your numbers, presumably youd get this in lowsec with my estimate on your numbers.
---
to get isk efficiancy or dank kills? roam fast, and youll need a good 2 or 3 scouts. experianced in hunting to be fully successful.
---
main objective is work out what you want to do. dont just move without a plan. once plan set. stick to it

Bud 12bil in caps ... that is less than a single super ;)

wait, rly ..... like dailies are back?

Can i laugh now?

Because to get this lot of sp you HAVE to fully login... and do more pve shit.

Made u login winwin for CCP

You should put this at the top so that people can place a value marker on the rest of the wall of text.

Based on the question and your name, guessing you are coming from FPS style games? when I crossed over from Counter Strike (1.6 era?) I had a lot of the same feelings about not using WASD. I'd recommend embracing it, honestly.
---
Wait, what? That is it?
---
I mean... At least it's extremely easy! 
---
Hell, me sitting with the boys harvesting a moon and a random rat spawn will be enough to grab what I need lol
---
Is it just me or is it something borked? Logged into an alpha account - got 1kill for 10k SP. Logged into my first omega clone, got 5 kills for 25k. logged into my 2nd omega clone and got the alpha 1kill 10k sp reward
---
Some people will always hold out for Jams.
---
an nobody really cared about gokus all that much for all those years to be fair
---
it wasnt until init did the whole stuka thing that people wondered
---
If I do it on an Alpha character who already has 5 million SP, will I still get those 10k?
---
This is the most naive and ridiculous look at web development I've ever seen. It's just not true.
---
He's right isn't he.  In order to make wormholes great again, CCP needs to prevent dscan from working inside a wormhole.
---
Group up your entire multibox fleet. Fleet warp to anom. Use one character in a carrier. Kill rats. Dock up. Done.
---
Caps should not be in holes, period.
---
Indeed.

NC.PL invaded Provi and took all the faction forts.

---
Chaos will end sooner then later, everyone hoping for good results. CCP made a one way bet there is no way back from blackout.
---
So it's random, that's good to know. Did you get the 24h wait in all cases?
---
I think yes, it simply grants 10k SP that you should be able to apply.
---
You regularly post great improvements for the game. Why does CCP not implement them.
---
CCPlease I need infinite free SP not timegated free SP.
---
Security through obscurity counts as doing something nasty. If releasing the source code as it is would put the security of his systems at risk then it wasn't ready for a public release.
---
Share source please
---
Why are you building daft computer game tools on Oracle lol
---
Not saying that at all mate, but I had at least expected something a little more challenging.
---
That's exactly what I expected.
---
I hope people believe you. J space could always use more ~~targets~~ ~~content~~ inhabitants.
---
AFAIK the amount depends on the NPC type or something. The value is between 10k and 50k.
---
The source code should have been out with the public release.
---
just use frigs, you'll be done even before the carrier would have landed
---
If it's useful for you great but it's not a good fit honestly. Just about everything EVE tools wise is pretty typical web-based stuff in the usual OSS languages. Siggy being .NET is about the only real exception that comes to mind.
---
Don't mind me just voicing my wish.
---
Boson you say?
---
Alpha here, just killed one NPC, 10K SP credited. \o/
---
The real question is how to get 50K (?)
---
Bull.
---
im still getting the old sp event - it says there is 23hrs left too! do i need to go ratting for the new system to kick in?
---
Share the fit!
---
Except some people want to be able to fly across the map and do things. Wartarget status wont prevent facpo from exploding you.
---
A bhaal hull is 130m more than a geddon in jita. The geddon only gets range bonuses to its neuts. If they have a c5 static they definitely have the numbers to run static sites in nestors. The neut amount bonus on the bhaal is definitely worth the extra cost, let alone the flexibility of being able to run a nos fit to take pressure off the guard cap chain if they don't have logi 5 or worse are relying on augs
---
ikr?
---
It appears you get one random task per day, giving different amounts of SP
---
Looks like some house cleaning.
---
IT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM
---
Oh, no, an event that requires you to (gasp!) *actually do shit* to get your rewards instead of just passively collecting them without even logging in? Shock, horror!
---
That is true, but for me its much easier to make in in APEX :) so thats why i choose it. And because i got SSO working everyone can use it. They dont have to ofcourse, but the more options you have the better you can find something that fits your play style. And running this application for your own (even with the source code) is not for everyone.
---
I don't think anyone expected anything huge from this event, it was always going to be fairly limited in scope since handing out boatloads of SP is a good way to unbalance the game.
---
Why did that link open a RnK video for me? Lol
---
I was thinking the ships are initially empty or have a few guns on it, with maybe no/little ammo. So you gotta loot other cargo containers to find ammo, reppers and other guns. There would be a few mobile depots either in cargo containers or anchored in space, to be used and refit. They would probably be hotspots too, as people refit and camp to prevent other people from refitting.
---
Anyone remember when it was an hour or more?  This was particularly egregious to Aussie TZ players as it was in their primetime.
---
I remember when downtime was an hour long... got some sweet rest those days
---
Where do you see this?
---
My quest was to kill 5 NPCs for 25k SP - but do bots count as NPCs?
---
Where is that task viewed?
---
I mean it's Tim, so obviously his advice would be enyos
---
Joking aside. After completing the challenge you get a new one in &lt;23 hours. The challenge is per character not per account, so you can repeat it on the other 2 character slots on your account for extra SP.
---
They arent sleepers
---
Sorry but what did you expect ? This is CCP we are talking about, they probably made a lot of us to get up to the character selection screen with their previous "Free SP" event and now they are trying to lure as to take the next step and pass that screen with more promised free SP.
---
nope. just checked with corp members. everyone got random 10/25k sp rewards on both alpha and omega accounts. weird
---
&gt; get used to the shakes
---
Lol I got in a bs fight last night me in typhoon him in domi. My heart was so far in my throat it leaped into my skull and the pounding in my ears was deafening. I was so worried that a cyno was gonna be lit cuz I had no friends on at the time to help me. Then i noticed he was hull tanked with heavy nuets and it hit me harder. 
---
"This is it. Bye poon phoon. You treated me well. I love you." 
---
Nope he nueted me out and left. All that excitement for nothing. I rarely get battleship fights so I was on edge as could be and just got blue balled hard.
---
Changes that are just as original and close to an ideal world as this suggestion is. I also remember stories about Dev items falling into the hands of average players. So in a similar but not identical "accident" someone should be able to undock a cockroach.
---
Good. Maybe they can get back to what's important... filming more episodes of Bondi Rescue.
---
What he means is this might be an elaborate trick to mask any declining login/activity numbers due to the blackout.
---
&gt; there is no way back from blackout
---
Pvp npcs really think this, don't they?
---
One of those things my ratting alt will do by accident, so not interesting.
---
Joking aside.        
---
CCP is better at burning new players dreams than veterans.        
---
All newbies i know were hyped that they will skill faster ... now i cannot wait till i get home ... and laugh at them :D                
---
If you think that 25k sp is worth reloging chars or even logging in ........ sure if you have 1 account - if more then "fuck it"
---
On a non-joking matter, scientists recently discredited the notion humans have any considerable effect on climate change. Imagine how dumb you had to be to think the human race influenced climate any discernible degree compared to the sun.

Well, that makes it sound like a more reasonable dust up.

Correct, I am a know nothing former video game developer, who worked on two AAA MMOs, and who has been playing this game since 2006. I am also, with my PhD in a social science, someone who does not know enough about human behavior to size up a guy like you, who frankly probably poisons every community they find themselves in--either real or virtual.
---
I think more likely is they're seeing if people log in just for the sp (the past week's login rewards) or log in then stick around vs seeing if the sp reward for doing things in space makes people stick around after logging in. I don't think it's a "trick" to fudge the numbers so much as it is experimenting with different stuff to see what happens.
---
I have two accounts.. on one I only got 10k SP+timer on the other I get 25k SP.. is this bugged on normal?
---
if you cant wear a wife beater, jorts, and thongs, then is life really worth living?

Yea what's the fit?.

Could this be a "jump into the cold water" vs "slowly getting in" kind of thing? What I mean is, it depends on the person how he learns best?
---
As in, if you learn how to kite in a navy slicers, you can probably also kite in a BC. But it can be a pain to start with a super fast frigs, which can lead to frustation.
---
Sounds like a mall santa. Don't think you need to worry about being sinister.

When I started playing EvE back in 2011 literally every single player in the game was recommending Drake as an ultimate machine for any purpose. In a while Drake was rebalanced and Tengu became a superior ship for the time being. Another rebalance comes, and everyone started using dronboats, especially Ishtar. Guess what? Ishtar was rebelanced! Then Confessor and Swipul...
---
Well, what I'm trying to say is fly whatever ship you feel more comfortable with, do not overly rely on "conventional wisdom" - people tend to use OP hulls, but you may end up with a year of skill queue training wasted eventually.
---
I have some and when I tried to ask in Jita local people piped up with bpo’s and spam built them and handed them to everyone who asked for one
---
Wait so we only get the sp once per day...?
---
Because the demands of mainline alliances membership are usually either too much or something most rental corps are not interested in doing.
---
If your an indy corp, getting X number of kills per member per month is never gonna happen.  There are also corps that generally don't want to do massive fleet warfare, full API checks etc.
---
Or kill 5 other players
---
My point is simply that frigate fights don't last long enough, and their engagement profile is too low *in the hands of a newbro* to make them a good learning platform.
---
If you do the whole "lose 20 rifters" program - as a newbro you probably got a grand total of 12 minutes on grid in a fight out of those 20 rifters.
---
Put the same newbro in a tanky ass phantasm trainer fit and he probably got more than an hour of time on grid fighting out of 20 hulls. 
---
Once he has the basics down own some manual piloting, knowing ship types, damage application, heating, tackling, so on and so forth - then move into frigates.
---
Goons.  Goons.  Goons.  They’re prosecuting an “embargo”.  Legacy is not participating in any embargo.
---
The real reason everyone in null uses supers: They kept losing sabres to battle-herons.
---
Killing 5 tapi or goon linemembers count as NPC kills so yeah ( in game)
---
I'm more surprised that dumpster Bora Alis took that long to disband.
---
Yeah, but would need to be 5 war targets , you know how scrubby eve players are they would just shoot their alt 5 times
---
The passive tanked phant might be easier to learn in, as you don't have to manage a shitton of modules while trying to sigtank on top
---
It would be glorious!!! xD
---
Why are you crying? Killing 1 or 10 noc to have 10k or 50k sp is really nice.
---
Hope it will help new player or player that are skilling with a goal. For myself i will be happy to finish tactical weapon V faster. Some sp is still good to take ;)
---
No one seems to have answered your website question.
---
Use Discord.  Add a few text channels and a voice channel or two.
---
Small groups don't really need a whole website, imo.

This is so true. My first solo kill was in a heron too. Podded the guy too. They went apeshit at me for months. I'm like, you're in losec, deal! Lol

So, is there a superior alternative?

I saved a whooooole six hours off my que.
---
Alright, if what you're saying is true, what is the superior alternative?
---
Webcam all agree that engaging a blob of 200 with 10 pilots is risky...
---
If you're engaging a blob I would assume you have already calculated the risk of doing so and found that the odds were manageable.
---
Or you're employing a strategy that mitigates some of the risk.
---
Doing research in a 1 billion autism chariot, god bless your poor retarded soul.
---
It's seems we are given a random task per day, that task goes from kill 1 NPC to get 10k sp up to kill 5-10 NPCs to grab 50k sp.
---
Wait till you get to the point that your skill queue is &gt;1year and you don't even check what was finished in last 3 months.
---
true, its why PLA Associates exists in period basis :P

Do you seriously believe that a krabbing VNI, Dominix, or Myrmidon cannot defend itself against someone that tackles them? Or an escalation-running Rattlesnake or T3C?
---
Yikes
---
Yesterday: What the fuck, free SP, seriously CCP with your stupid incentives, reee ded game I'm unsubbing all 50 accounts
---
Today: 10k SP? Really? That's it? Wow CCP, always with your stupid incentives, reeee ded game I'm unsubbing all 50 accounts
---
Aww cute you must be in frat.  I hope you have fun merging into the rest of Panfam
---
Partner, best be on your way.
---
*Heeeyaaah!!!*
---
**\*Moves his herd of accounts into the sunset\***
---
bye felicia
---
Obvious bait post. Better luck next time...
---
\#Jesusrambodiedforyourdreads spread the gospel.
---
Awww hey bestie - wanna go blap some frat krabs later?
---
Have you ever seen Ultra Cow's videos?
---
Local in high security space. You can build there.
---
Sooo errr how am I suppose to do this on my industry alt?
---
Everything is valid vs TDSIN. Honestly surprised seeing them in something other than yachts.
---
God this repetitive shit is tiresome...
---
go back to highsec
---
Man... You NEVER eat the whole brownie until you know how much is in it
---
Dont listen to the troll. You made many mistakes in sequence,  but I'm willing to bet you won't make them next time! 
---
Moving a super is especially dangerous but even the slightest scent of danger should be enough to put it off for a day or two.  I've never lost one to moving because I take no risks and I give zero opportunities for anyone to relay intel.
---
If you are doing it alone, make sure you are really doing it alone. Especially don't tell your friends what your doing, do it yourself don't ask for any help. Fit a 500mn absolutely and I-stabs. If you can, do it just before downtime and wait it out, it's worth 15 bil. If it's lowsec, never jump into a system that has anyone else in it. Also, blues greens and light blues are all potential spies scouting you, consider them all enemy scouts waiting for you to let your guard down thinking you are safe.
---
Never jump to a fail cyno with any super ever, it should only be lit for 12-13 seconds at the very most and ONLY in an empty system. Anything else is an amateurs mistake.
---
Hope you make a better play next time.
---
It face-tanks over 1,600dps a second if you shoot it with perfect application pure thermal damage.  
---
Also, while I agree that pimped ab's are excellent on a phantasm - this is a \*trainer fit\*  
---
And, the difference between a y-s8 and a corelum a-type is less than 300m/s cold - even on a phantasm that isn't the massive exponential sig tanking difference you imply it is - feel free to look in pyfa for yourself.  
---
And again, even if it was.... you do not need any more tank lol.
---
&gt; and I turn completly to pvp.
---
so the change was successful =) good to see it working
---
No one cares about your humble brag shit man
---
Reffing means nothing. It takes no effort in comparison to killing the ihub on the second timer.
---
&gt;...and I turn completly to pvp.
---
Guess the blackout is working as intended...
---
HTFU
---
Don't know about Bora Alias, who where they again?
---
Snuffed just cleaned house basically. they where all dead corps. lowsec is dead blah blah blah.
---
P3AK are elite mans and need to do something more elite (theres a real story here but lets not share it publicly) then frag tapi.
---
really? :( what a let down
---
What.  A.  Fucking.  Joke.  
---
I don’t even think they’re trying.  They’re just throwing shit out to see what works.
---
Fuck off you took my comment...
---
Fuck that reminded me of a chool trip top paris...worst busride of my life
---
So CCP are not dumb and hide this event from ppl with no clue so not many people get free SP, no Task popup.. event flag not active u need to find it first ^^ smart move CCP!!fu
---
ironic that right below this "[–]Wallymarts01NullSechnaya Sholupen
---
That was fun tanking mouth breathers for over an hour, god bless the cheap tank dread meta"
---
login number alone are meaningless. at least that's what i have been told whenever i mentioned "eve is dying"
---
Move to lowsec, forget high sec keep it for an alt for doing purchases and hauling them to your lowsec home. You'll have more fun than you ever have in highsec.
---
go cloak up again
---
never not FC!
---
Something like the last events way back when. Kill one for 10k, next kill 5 for 25k, next kill 10 for 50k. Or specific assignments, like kill 5 belt rats for 50k, kill 5 Triglavians etc etc
---
I'm aware that a small corp like ours currently is has no need for a website.
---
I was asking more about if the corp started growing and be came a "real" corp that did "real" things. What's expected?
---
I like when nullbears assume we should care about their PLEX'ed krab accounts while pumping shitloads of bounties and minerals into the game.
---
Oh, I'm just about there. 257 days to get perfect skills with ONE ship and a few trade skills thrown in there.
---
I hope nobody falls for this fakepost.
---
I don't get this sentiment - are you implying the only "correct" way to play Eve is to PvP?
---
Nah, when I started this game I did it solo. The tutorial effectively said, here you go, now go fuck off into space.
---
EVE doesn't need players who got babied into staying in the game. That's not the type of player this game has ever catered to, and we shouldn't start now. That bullshit is how we ended up here.
---
The game needs players who embrace the reality and harshness of EVE.
---
Was that me?
---
It sucked, but it was all we knew. Praise Bob for DT length these days, however the timing is still a pain in the balls.
---
Very carefully?
---
Report them. Problem solved.
---
No.
---
I know what I said.
---
&gt;  Thats 20 less income for CCP each months, and I turn completly to pvp. 
---
Don't threaten this community with a good time
---
&gt;only
---
/s?

HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA

Nobody gives a single fuck about it.
---
the argument is much more detailed then just "nerf this cause it kills me" but i can't expect critical thinking of a cultist that benefits from status quo. maybe read some articles from suitonia or jintaan, they explained well enough for even a short sighted mouth breather like you to understand
---
I do. Every day. also im laughing out loud at you.
---
Oh right we’re yet out there for the LoLz.  Sure dude.  Tell you what if frat forms up even close to the same response fleets as what we saw on the initial reinforcements exactly 15 more will flip.  For those goons who are slow that would mean there will be no response fleet formed because all of the frat krabbing cream have moved their stuff to the drone lands.  
---
All the ADMs in the western half of detorid are into dogshit levels.  Watch the constellations of T875-C &amp; HOV-VI as well as the 03-4MN system in detorid.  Then in scalding watch the 51ZT-6; YCM-AI; 7VJ-7M constellations.  Finally in wicked creek, 5YIE-3 and GU-JZ1 constellations.  
---
M9-MLR appears to being flipped back to frat but they won’t be able to online a jammer there if they hold it. 
---
But there’s 30 systems being contested now.  How people are being ignorant of this is astonishing
---
Many groups will escalate far more if they see a Bhaal than a Geddon, the Geddon is great for cheap fleets like Prophecies or Brutixes
---
Get rid of FW missions for a start
---
Loki
---
&gt;     Another powerful tool capital ships have at their disposal is the ability to ignore travel time with their jump drives.
---
&gt; This is also largely the case with battleships. I can get from r1o to BWF in 3 jumps rather than the ordinary 15 jumps by using ansiblexes.
---
this one alone. you are comparing apples and oranges.
---
Funny
---
it was penif.
---
When you think about actually flying this fit - it's actually quite simple. The hardest thing initially is going to be not overtanking.
---
You immediately turn on the AB and Invulns, and in most fights there won't be much reason to ever turn them off, so you're generally done thinking about those guys until you start getting some decent neut pressure you cant get away from.
---
So now you've really just got 4 hotkeys to worry about
---
Guns
---
Scram
---
XLASB 1
---
XLASB 2
---
So you mostly just manual pilot around, mess with tracking &amp; transversal - try to catch things, try to not get caught by other things.
---
As you take damage, most times you're going to be red cycling one ASB as needed with the hotkey - when it goes on reload you just start red cycling the other ASB. If you start having to use both at the same time more than occasionally and aren't about to clear some DPS off the field - it might be time to start thinking about taking your drogas, de-agressing and heading back to gate - which this fit actually has the sustain tank to do in many situations.   
---
Passive would be easier yeah, the point of this fit is for him to learn to do the main things you'll usually be doing in solo pvp but on easy mode. Almost all pvp fits are active tanked so that's pretty important to learn.
---
Killing stuff is definitely not the point of these fits, the kitey one especially - it's more about figuring out tracking and transversal and seeing how your guns apply. The brawly one, you can definitely kill stuff with 400dps if you catch it.
---
true, that's why their are so tasty when you catch them
---
Some Goons win with heron, some goons lose against heron :P
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/73249435/
---
what's the difference to using titan models to decloak ppl on gate? that's so much more exploitable then what these guys did. at least camping and hunting that super took effort. afking with 5 titans on a gate so you can decloak and boson everything that jumps through seems much more broken.
---
It varies. If you’re in a high/low-sec. alliance, probably pretty low (no more than a bil. per month I’d guess, often much lower). In null-sec., the alliance fees are often 1bil. or larger. It’s been a while since I’ve been down there though, so maybe someone else can correct me if I’m wrong.
---
In response, Liberty Squad has deployed its super capitals now to Frarie.
---
No, but more pvp pilots is better
---
Look at his history, it's broken English complaining about every game. So either the op is mentally ill, or speaks broken English and gets bullied in every game.
---
NJED is recruiting, since you already know our speciality.
---
RR Cyclones are great for 6-10 man groups, they are cheap, don’t require a ton of SP and have good DPS compared to a lot of small fleet doctrines since they don’t need Logi/Bhaal/Geddon.

So what you're telling me is that it is a blue balls non war as nothing is fighting back. Good to know.
---
That is... Hilarious
---
the pvp part happens as soon as you interact with the market. and yes, you are competing with the other miners in that belt. to think otherwise is pretty delusional.

Probably implying that nullsec shouldn't be carebear heaven.

But Mom I don't want my daily Skills. I want a Skill injector

---
&gt;but i can't expect critical thinking of a cultist that benefits from status quo
---
A cultist? That's a new one 
---
&gt;maybe read some articles from suitonia or jintaan, they explained well enough for even a short sighted mouth breather like you to understand
---
You mean:
---
&gt;I need someone else to make my arguments for me, because I am incapable of voicing my opinion in a coherent manner. 
---
Or maybe you're just following the Reddit hivemind, with no understanding of why. You have nothing to say, but you're still saying things. Why is this?
---
Haaaaaa.
---
God forbid **170+** subcaps might actually be able to out-dps the tank on a single capital ship.
---
My drones where 2 x Fed Navy Ogres 2 x Valkyries II and an Acolyte. Also I had Ion blasters. That’s probably the reason I had less DPS than you.
---
MJDs are absolutely amazing GTFO tools. There’s sorta two main use cases for solo stuff:
---
1. You’re in something brawly (think brutix or something), and you can haze anything within scram range and then MJD to safety
---
2. You’re in something kitey, and when you see something starting to get shitty in terms of positioning you can MJD to safety before you get a crammed
---
It’s this and the fact that the Titan was stollen from the ferra trash to begin with so really... Titan pilot 1; ferra garbage 0.  But yes let’s shitpost on reddit about a tapi Titan and spin it as how fucking smart and dedicated ferra are.  As per usual(doesn’t matter what group is posting) shit being posted on Reddit is always propaganda and omits key details.
---
anecdotal evidence. very convincing.
---
i see what you did there with your flare Mark.
---
It’s mostly people pushing groups to move to C5 space (C5 space is actually easier to do logistics in, and you can carrier roll solo instead of using a bunch of BS’s), saying that, living in C5 space comes with slightly higher expectations when it comes to brawls (3 cap meta, Leshaks Online etc) and whilst some groups will be fine if you undock cheap ships in C5 space, some groups may decide to evict you (Inner Hell in particular like evicting small groups if they think there’s profit to be made).
---
This! Null sec is definitely a good place to make isk, but it also is something that It was never supposed to be... It's SAFE!
---
Staying AFK docked is the only activity in EVE that cannot involve PVP, change my mind...
---
Also, it's 2019, are you assuming the core value of my statement? You're the one in the wrong sir!
---
Have to fit ion, because fitting.  5 ogres.  Makes all the difference.
---
This guy's pure joy at getting out alive is why I continue to play this game. Pure joy moments are so good.
---
&gt; My point is if CCP nerf the thing you like flying/have worked hard towards getting, your enjoyment/interest will take a hit too
---
people like that should have never started playing. eve has always been about loss.
---
didnt you quit?
---
True dat
---
You tried the RR Cyclones? How did it go?
---
Probably not.
---
Wouldn't let you know, either way.  :D
---
Kevin, what's wrong?
---
Playing a game should be about loss? 
---
Gee, I sure hope CCP bring back and buff drifters attacks. You'll be beside yourself with fun as you lose every ship you undock in for no real reason.
---
Go build stuff in high/lowsec where there is local
---
nope. those are unkillable for a solo player since the fighter changes. strange how, for every ship class there is a counter in a smaller ship class except for super capitals aka the most SP intensive and ISK intensive ship class. kind of makes you think about p2w.
---
Uh... what else were you expecting? Endless 10k SP kills? Maxing characters out during the event?
---
&gt; I need someone else to make my arguments for me, because I am incapable of voicing my opinion in a coherent manner. 
---
no, what i mean is, that the issues presented have been in the game for ages and i (and many others) are tired of repeating them.
---
Did anyone else try to click the ccp kitteh gif?
---
you are comparing apple with oranges again. Balancing the game != deleting all your stuff because "lol htfu"
---
Just install a pace maker, that heartbeat will be there even after brain death.
---
You lost me at "reason for this is to help defend citadel"... We don't need them to be even harder to kill...
---
Same reason they let you post?
---
The only real story is to always follow your heart :pepelove:
---
Yep, is character skilling -&gt; yes.        
---
&gt;6months later ... ah forgot to revmap and use implants, oh well .......
---
fuckin agree
---
?
---
Do you think people will ever fly stuff like this in nullsec to deal with the increased danger?
---
Bait post.      
---
Industrialist don't turn into pvpers, look at PL.
---
Had a couple okay fights, but we were rolling them through the wrong neighbourhood and largely ended up getting supers dropped on us every time. They worked well in jspace - be careful of bombers.
---
It's kinda sad when people can't even tell if a war is still happening because it's moving so slowly.
---
They did when they brought in bombers, god forbid you bring proper counter ships from the start you fucking mong.
---
TAPI actually came back with a second muninn ship after welping the first one
---
Bora are a russian alliance form venal, they've been dead for ages and the remaining players play with OOS + friends.
---
Wow, so lucky :-D 
---
You panicked a bit at first though. They chewed through about 1/3 of your shields before you actually started locking them and trying to clear points. 
---
Good work getting out though. GG
---
“Uh I have so much SP I don’t even acknowledge what’s in my queue omg it’s so annoying”
---
Gfys
---
It doesn't shock me that p3ak left frat. I didn't expect frat's risk averse leadership to like their "do stuff" playstyle. Somewhat surprised they didn't awox out tbh.
---
I...I think it's trying to speak...
---
Sure, it would help if they brought the proper ships, but 150+ of anything should be able to kill any one ship. Eagles might not be the optimal choice, but it's not like they're corvettes.
---
You are absolutely wrong there.  Battlecruisers are maybe one of the strongest hulls for solo roaming in the game.  The max insurance payout also means they cost very little more than a cruiser but benefit from having an MJD and significantly more dps.  MJD plays a significant role in splitting larger groups up and getting a fight more favorable for yourself.  Nano BCs can work, but in the ram jag heavy meta only with support.
---
Are you seriously one of those people who think that accounts kept subbed with PLEX are somehow harming the bottom line of the game?
---
I'd say Discord should cover your needs for a long while.  If you start running into limitations, then look into a website.
---
Outside of hosting your own Killboard, ESI pulling for "reasons," and hosting your own guides ala the large NS alliances, I don't see a need for one.
---
Google sheets for accounting, pinned messages with links to useful guides and utilities, active discussion of members.  These would be a step up over a lot of groups, and make it seem like you have your shit together.  Even if you don't, appearance is most of the battle!
---
Just think back to groups you've been in over the years.  What did they have you appreciated?  Was there anything that annoyed you?  Are there any times you thought "x" would be nice to have?  The more you provide, the better you'll meet the expectations of members.  Just remember to look at things from a new member viewpoint.
---
Guess it is random what you get, mine was only 1 for 10K
---
This. Goons are rich as fuck, so we don't care about a couple bill of rent more or less, they do however care about their enemies getting less isk for free
---
happened to me once and i learned my lesson. Buddy had some homemade cookies at a conference and said "only eat a bit, i really fucked with these" but me, being a dumbass ate the whole cookie and spent the next hours watching MacGuyver episodes in a corner.
---
Declining numbers my ass. Its been maybe 1k less people per day. Get up out of here with that shit
---
Not sure if cringe level bait
---
or cringe level complaint..
---
Give stuff
---
You will metaphorically starve by death
---
I was totally ready to afk farm the shit out of some havens and get like a billion SP
---
Yeah, they are strong - so are frigates.
---
I think you forgot the point of this thread is to find a fit for someone who has no clue what they are doing to jump into solo pvp without caring about isk (so we don't care about that insurance payout).
---
More dps? who cares, he needs to learn to fly first, killboard doesn't matter.
---
MJD is great, but not in the hands of a newbro v the blob - will 100% time it wrong, forget to use it or in some other way waste the jump.
---
Roaming at 3AU's isn't the best thing - further slowing it down to 2.7AU plus BC align time is prettty rough for a newbro just trying to get into fights he can learn something in.
---
Newbro in a BC is just gunna get hard blobbed or dropped on over and over again. 
---
Stop trying to think about a fit for this dude like it's a fit that you would fly, or a fit that's good for pvp. He needs a fit that he can learn in, full stop.
---
Don't bubble ##US##
---
No but PLEX'ed null PvE alts are harming the bottom line of the game.
---
“THEY’RE AFRICANIZED!”
---
I used to fly them in EPSYN - I know how spooky bombers are :)
---
Getting supers dropped on you in NS certainly sucks...
---
:pepelove:
---
i knwo it is based on tier and type but i don't know numbers T5 Dark is the most money i think. but feel free to ask on the discord :) Fonsui will most likely know. i usualy call him THE Abyss guy
---
No - initial cost is wayyyyyyy too high and for the setup they use (esp with bots) WHs are unironically safer since you can see when a new sig spawns.
---
I mean data and relic sites
---
And what does that 1b buy me? The right to be blue?
---
Sounds wrong as an avargae 
---
i run t4 Gamas and i am avaraging on 40 mil i think 
---
and keep in mind it got nerfed
---
If it's like the SP granted last week for as the login event yes.
---
I think it's just training that is paused at 5mil as an alpha, not any injections of SP as there's more skills than that you can train and use as an alpha.
---
You could go to delve and change that? Kill everyone and make it very dangerous!
---
Waaaah
---
ohh im onl grabbing the bioadaptive cache usualy 
---
but i do 5 sites an hour
---
If you are going play this game longer you will get the same approach.            
---
Usually the moment when you can fly all T2 ships use all T2 modules ... you get less and less interest in what is in your skill queue.               
---
I honestly don't know how much SP my main have as it don't matter any more.
---
I’m not but ok
---
Frig sites or cruisers? The numbers listed are for frigs which pay out way more than cruisers
---
It's not though, even with local you could still get popped. I mean, it's easier to get popped these days it's true.
---
But it's not like CONCORD would show up if you started taking potshots at a random Hulk out in 0.0.
---
I mean, granted, if hypothetical-hulk dude gets popped in his hulk out in 0.0, dude deserved to get popped-
---
Yeah because 4 vs 15 with the enemy having eyes already, sounds like fun. Wasn't going to feed to nrem. I'll feed to about anyone else
---
A drone boat and 1.0sec anoms/missions.
---
I rolled an alpha a few days ago for fun to be a logi focus, and even with minimal drone skills I cleared out the tutorial combat and advanced combat missions easy.
---
So you are skilling 25% faster if you save 6 hrs/day.
---
That seems pretty significant.
---
Tell me where the SP touched you.
---
My 2 alts got 10k each and my main 25k.
---
I don't think the actual, real math of that checks out. XYZ less accounts is XYZ less plex used which means overall it's XYZ less plex purchased for sale. If you were to re-state that to "not harming the health of the game" rather than "financial well being" you may be closer to being correct (waiting to see the MER in August to see the cliff that activity went off).
---
This post is bad and you should feel bad about it.
---
Translation, out of work.
---
Are you actually saying game mechanics made specifically to boost log in numbers are a good thing?
---
Eve is supposed to be the opposite of that.
---
Imagine if, rather than ransoming your stuff or your enemy's stuff back, the loot stood a 15-20% chance of going through normal loot mechanics where RNG fairies gave a chance for your purple loki to drop as loot. THAT would make killing cits a little more worth the week plus it takes and it would add risk to citadels without sending AFK pilots to the poor house.
---
Why, though?
---
I'm not opposed to PVP at all, I think the whole warfare aspect of Eve is the coolest part.
---
I just don't get this whole idea that if you want to not engaged in fighting then you're somehow doing Eve wrong.
---
Like those CODE wierdoes that decided that you're apparently not allowed to mine in High-sec.
---
What if I enjoy mining? What if I legitimately enjoy multiplayer spreadsheets? What if I have no interest in taking part in fighting? Am I playing Eve wrong?
---
So is this per account or per char?
---
I just hope it really is bait.
---
&gt; it's 3/4 through its cycle when I deactivate cloak
---
This is *not* "doing the cloak trick." At least by my definition. The *whole point* of doing the cloak trick is to be aligned and ready to warp on the same tick that you drop cloak. 3 seconds of trundling along with 500% sig bloom does not qualify.
---
You can have the last word on this if you insist. I will not be paying attention.
---
They were already there. Accelerators as loot in event sites is essentially the same thing.
---
LOL - I can hear the Blues Brother's "HEAD EM UP, MOVE EM OUT"
---
I get that.  But what is that?  5 years or so?
---
It’s always gotta be something like this doesn’t it.
---
Neg vote Nancy got you. Ha Ha!
---
Spod
---
Can second (third? fourth by now?) the wormhole idea. They really can be a lot of fun with a small, tight-knit group of friends.
---
I'd also recommend not necessarily Only Doing One Thing in EVE. Like you said ... it gets boring quick. No matter what you do, honestly. EVE is a game that is so broad that you can do something different every day and not repeat yourself for a week. Specialized characters is a good idea objectively, but it's also fun to be able to do a little of everything.
---
More specific answers:
---
1. **Mining organization.** There are a lot of different ways to do it, some of which have been mentioned already. Probably the easiest is for the corp to buy the stuff from its members using a calculator based on the corp's best-skilled refiner. You can use something like this [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wqd9W49v3nmuk07i1MCuYgBe94zfaQdr3lUws7bLoHw/copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wqd9W49v3nmuk07i1MCuYgBe94zfaQdr3lUws7bLoHw/copy) or make one yourself. I'd also recommend if you haven't already done so, that one of y'all skill into an Orca so you can mine with boosts to make things more efficient. The best places to mine are the most dangerous, so there is a tradeoff to make there. In hisec, your best bet is to find a place to drop an citadel on a good moon and mine there. Or find some public ones (I *think* eve mogul's site lists them somewhere?) or join a corp/alliance that has some.

2. **Industry.** Get basic skills first, and decide on an area you want to get into. t2 modules is probably the route to go for most corps, though it takes a bit of skilling. I'd second the recommendation to sell somewhere like Amarr instead of Jita. Buy compressed ore in Jita (use a calculator like [https://pgsus.space/pricer](https://pgsus.space/pricer) to see how much of what you need) or mine it yourself, make stuff, sell in Amarr. My corp, Lucifer's Hammer, actually has a "production program" set up, where the corp provides the bpcs &amp; minerals, and compensates members based on the time their characters spend producing, researching, copying, inventing, etc. It's a neat way to get more people involved with production, and a cool introduction to the mechanics of how it works for those newer to it. 
---
3. **Corporations.** Discord is a great idea and a good way to keep in touch. Just ask the dudes you play with what they prefer. Some corps just use in-game bulletins &amp; mails/mailing lists and the calendar. Ultimately it depends on what you want to do. If you want to only play with your buds, just talk about what you like doing &amp; if you feel like changing direction you can. If you have as an EVE goal the desire to run a corporation and grow it, I'd recommend joining another corp for a while to learn how they do things, and then break off once you feel more confident. ... Just sayin' ABA is a great alliance with Good People, and Lucifer's Hammer is a great place to get your feet wet in mining/industry. Also we have moons. ;)
---
As far as goals and whatnot, talk to your corp mates. Get a feel for the things that they're eyeing and you're eyeing and give it a shot. Maybe one of you is like "y'know incursions sound kinda neat" so you all work towards skilling into and building the battleships you'll need for it and then jump in together. Or maybe someone does say "wormholes sound cool to live and mine in" so you explore and find a good c1 to settle and work together toward building the structures to live in. Or maybe someone says "guys we should do pvp stuff for a bit" so you relocate to a faction warfare area, join a side, and build or buy some ships to fight in for a few months. Or "let's get t2 industry going". Or ore. Or ... you get the idea.
---
Hope that helps. :)
---
If you've got any questions, hit me up!
---
For real, if you shoot an NPC a day and save 6 hours you will get roughly over a free week of skill training. I'll take that. Helps people who actually play the game instead of play fourm warrior.
---
Pretty sure you lost that game, the pilot baited you for 5 years to get a kill.
---
Every single hull has a learning curve friend.  With frig duals you have to constantly micro manage overheat, ammo, range, reps.  Its no different with any fight really.  The only ships that I feel are "easy" to fly are dual web arty thrasher and beam coercer.  So if OP wants low effort easy frags then he should fly those, but if he wants to actually get better he is going to have to welp.  A lot.  In a T1 BC is laughably easy to go ISK positive, which maybe doesn't mean a lot for people who can afford the losses, it will certainly help with morale.  Get bubbled and blobbed?  Quickly kill that sabre and you've gone ISK positive.  Being chased by a 12 man gang with tackle frigs?  MJD off gate and watch the ceptors and ramjag nerds burn straight towards you to their deaths.  If you manage to kill two ceptors or AFs you've gone ISK positive.  Realistically, the rock paper scissors meat grinder that is FW lowsec is no less complicated and out thinking the hordes of null mouth breathers.
---
Wormholes were never supposed to be lived in. Yet most folks with the "Null was never sposed to be safe" rhetoric ironically live in wormholes. Makes you think eh?
---
What you've described is how it is on TQ today, except the drop rate is 50%. Go shoot engineering complexes and reactor refineries.
---
Galaxy Brain play right there.
---
I thought we banned dailies?
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Not relevant to hisec, but half of the interceptors are no longer nullified. So don’t fly your claw around nullsec expecting to go through bubbles
---
Alternative to what?
---
What's it saying?
---
You see, you're doing it all wrong. Screaming and stamping your feet while making threats isn't really an argument.
---
I spend about half my time doing PVE stuff and I gotta tell you, Blackout has been fun for me despite my having a couple ships ganked. The feeling of the unknown is back in Eve and that's a good thing IMO.
---
Why do you not like the blackout? Would you suggest a compromise between instant perfect intel and no perfect and some imperfect intel at all?
---
If you're baiting, well done. That's a pretty good spleen venting.
---
CCP didn't think it was in a "worth it" way possible because all the additional hassle.     
---
And I would say they have since grown to the idea. Otherwise they would just have prevented upwell structures from being used (or even POS before that).
---
But they didn't intent WHs to be lived in by original design, that's correct.
---
Why is merging with the rest of panfam a bad thing?
---
Never not fall for funposts.
---
&gt;What if I have no interest in taking part in fighting? Am I playing Eve wrong?
---
You are welcome to do all of those things you mentioned, but you have to do so with the knowledge that sometimes PVP will happen to you whether you like it or not. That is a core part of the game, and if that's not okay with you, then you should look for a game that better suits your needs.
---
I mean, he could talk long con.  A failing economy can ruin the game at some point. Question remains if bleeding multiboxing accounts will "trim the fat" and make the game healthier, or harm the game because too many players leave over time.
---
That's how I understand his post. Maybe I'm thinking too much...
---
It's not a simple math issue.
---
Plexed accounts are ofc good pull the Plex prices higher to motivate people to pay $ for plex to CCP.
---
But when they pump isk and minerals into the game, directly or indirectly causing proliferation, inflation, faucets, lack of content due to proliferated umbrellas, and more, they become more harmful to the game than beneficial. 
---
So basically organic harms of someone's 20th Rorqual account outweigh the upward pressure it creates on Plex prices. There are only so many real people interested in purchasing Plex for real money. Most of them are pvpers. When you alienate a good portion of these you do much more harm than the benefit you bring by pressuring Plex prices upward. 
---
It might even be the case that there is a higher limit on plex prices at which point it becomes organically bad for the game, due to players leaving because they can neither afford sub nor farm plex, but they were legitimate parts of Eve ecosystem.
---
PLEXed accounts, even bots, provide an income stream to CCP by creating a demand for guys with RL income to make isk quick to buy shit.
---
By definition, this helps CCP's bottom line given this term is generally used in discussing a company's revenue.
---
I am not saying BOTS are good. I hate them but they are causing CCP to make money, which might explain their low priority to the admins.
---
\*sigh\*
---
the point isn't a pretty killboard - who even cares about going isk positive? that's just something people say to console themselves when they lose. 
---
The point it isn't to get kills, and it isn't to learn to fly any specific hull or class of ship.
---
In the scenarios you described - those are exactly what you don't want when learning, who cares if you went isk positive if you roamed for 30 minutes to get blobbed off the field in 26 seconds? Certainly not the guy with deep pockets.
---
The point is - to be able to   
---
A) remain on grid a long time 
---
 \--- while retaining the ability to ---
---
B) leave when you need to
---
MJD is cool and all, but when you're new - you're just gunna get scrammed by a ram jag more often than not and wonder why you wasted that slot.
---
MJD is something you bring \*after\* you have learned all of the basics of pvp.
---
How can one best learn the basics of pvp? By staying on grid a long ass time and leaving when the grid gets too rough - so that you can rep up and get into another fight and get more time on grid.
---
That was a hell of an advice ... ! Would love to be trained by you, or by someone with the same approach as you on this subject, the day i'll finaly kick my ass hard enough to start pvp-ing.
---
A supercapital generally takes the effort of several people to build. It should take at least that many to destroy.
---
&gt;I couldn't adapt so i'm dying.
---
&gt; XYZ less accounts is XYZ less plex used which means overall it's XYZ less plex purchased for sale
---
That's not strictly true.
---
Just because there is lower demand doesn't necessarily mean that there will be lower supply. It *can* mean that because the price of plex would drop, bringing less incentive to buy with RL money. But it doesn't guarantee that.
---
I would also argue that the lower demand from krabs would lower the price, which then encourages others to plex accounts who normally wouldn't, keeping plex at an equilibrium.
---
Basically what I'm saying is: Who fuckin' knows?
---
10k SP every day for 30 days =
---
Generally, your alliance fee goes toward upkeep of alliance assets (like structures) and programs (such as SRP), along with access to alliance operations and such. What you get depends heavily on the alliance - it’s going to vary. 
---
Not every alliance has the capacity to provide every program, or the space to provide every type of structure. Some provide more, and some give more freedom to individual corporations.
---
Oh hey you're the guy that shoey-d his own piss
---
I'm still multibox mining in two regions when I need isk. Hasn't affected me much except for a couple of small losses to kid aggro and retardation on my part.
---
Eagles have what, 300 DPS? 300 per ship even multiplied by 70 ships is like 20,000 DPS and A dread can very easily tank almost all of it. The mistake was bringing Eagles to fight caps in the first place.
---
80% of null is allied together, so the 20% is living to fight another day.
---
&gt;Like those CODE wierdoes that decided that you're apparently not allowed to mine in High-sec. What if I enjoy mining?
---
One of the major things that sets this game apart from your run-of-the-mill themepark MMO like WoW is the fact that these groups *can* come up with rules like that and try to impose them on other people. I'm not saying it's wrong for you to mine. But THEY are. Now it's your job to deal with them as best you can. Move away, fit more tank, fight them, bait them, whatever. The magic of this game is that it doesn't let people live in their own little bubble of isolation and avoid other people entirely, even in highsec. The moment you undock, you are liable to be touched in a naughty way by people who mean you harm. So something about it.
---
&gt;I just don't get this whole idea that if you want to not engaged in fighting then you're somehow doing Eve wrong.
---
I don't have a good response to this. I can say that historically, EVE culture has formed in an atmosphere of grim, dark, empty space which danger lurking around every corner. Somehow, this has produces a unique gaming experience that much of the playerbase struggles to find in modern games, which is why people stick around so long and keep coming back after leaving. There's just nothing like it, so there's a strong motivation to preserve this culture. 
---
If everyone suddenly made peace with each other and started mining in perfect safety, stopped roaming and invading hostile space and quit being general dicks to each other, then guess what - everyone would be incredibly rich in the most boring video game ever. Because the tendency seems to be in that direction (since everyone individually wants safety for themselves, even if not for others), players try to fight hard to encourage others to PvP more, take more risks, and discourage gameplay styles that are driven by money making. 
---
To put it bluntly, a player that goes on a roam generates more content (and thereby fun) for *other people*, including their enemies, than someone who stays in his colossal belt in a rorqual. 
---
I'm sorry this turned into such a wall, mostly it's just vague philosophy pulled straight out of my ass, but it's the best answer I can come up with to why pvp players tend to find praise and crabs tend to be discriminated against, at least on this subreddit.
---
At the end of the day, the spirit of this game is that you can do whatever the hell you chose to do, as long as you can personally create the circumstances in which you can be successful.
---
&gt; gets popped in his hulk out in 0.0, dude deserved to get popped-
---
And the guy in a trig cruiser that died to a Porpoise similarly deserved to get popped. Why, you ask? Because both happened in NULL where that sort of thing is supposed to be expected.
---
The problem is when people start having this expectation that they are safe. That had to be changed.

---
I'm not advocating in one direction or another for multiboxing. I was directly referencing the financial hit of losing accounts that suck down 500 plex per month. Someone is indeed buying or has bought that plex and paid real money for it. Each account not sucking down plex is less real cash of some currency being spent. Ideally, we get more real players- but it's still a cash crunch.
---
He’s not wrong.
---
The fuck does PLEXing them have to do with anything?
---
I can agree that people have scaled multi boxing to an insane degree. I don't know that I see it as trimming the fat. People are ok with multi boxing for fleet boosts or "solo" (with 3-4 accounts) game play, but not for generating isk?  It seems comical.  Ultimately, it would be very hard to enforce a single account rule so that's not really where my line of thinking was going, just the actual financial hit. No, not because I have some altruistic view of CCP; just curious.
---
Yep in those :)

Well don’t rly take that from this. It’s actually pretty surprising that goons just didn’t drop their signature mix of supers and a few titans on this and call it “gf” in local
---
I'd wager than 2000 less accounts using PLEX would not create a situation in which the price of plex drops so drastically that another 2000 random people decide to start monthly plexing. I don't see that as a reality that would come to pass. I would expect plex prices to plummet though due to lack of need and then the eventual sell off.
---
RIP Bora Alis, will never forget the fun we had against them in the WhySoSerious days. That tower, ph god, still have flashbacks of the struggle to kill it.
---
But I wasn't referring to any plexed account in the post I replied. I was referring to specific accounts that have specific effects on the games macroeconomy
---
Not sure if I wasn't clear. I know that some stuff drops from those but hangar items (which amount to ship cargo) do not.
---
My suggestion is a compromise between killing asset safety but making it a bit more risky than paying a 15% ransom. If yout Golem is in a hangar in the citadel, it's not going to drop. My suggestion is it gets a 20% chance of being added to the loot pile and is then designated destroyed or dropped by the existing mechanic.
---
Oh, and the ransom would go away. Whatever makes it to the appropriate destination is yours, free and clear.
---
I would also like to see the voluntary loot transport magic done away with. The drop off idea was a good way to handle contract scams but allowing a wizard to teleport the loot (on demand) across more space than a JF can reach is kinda dumb.
---
Right, I wasn't arguing your point or against it. More of a correlated point of discussion. There are times I don't shitpost.
---
Both of my accounts were 5 npcs for 25k.
---
If you sub with real money at least you are a direct contribution to the bottom line and there is no question on whether you help keeping the game afloat.
---
If you Plex them you are merely an upward pressure on Plex prices. While that is still beneficial, the benefits there get outweighed by organic harms of null pve accounts for reasons below.

---
What is that?
---
Per char
---
Yes. It goes into your unallocated SP on your character sheet regardless of clone state.
---
There is no actual cap to skillpoints for an alpha. There is the 5 million SP you can train for free. Then there's the 20 million cap you can reach using Daily Alpha Injectors. Then there's the approximate 20 million SP cap of skills which Alphas have access to. But even beyond that an Omega pilot with 100 million SP (or more) can lapse their account to Alpha state and still collect the event SP.
---
Welcome to r/eve
---
No one wants to contract out and wait to haul in some frigate/cruiser hulls.
---
The problem with this is that then you'd have to spend time in cancerous fleet comms with people who have never left their basement. Even the thought of that makes me want to log into account management to find the unsub button.
---
What is a suitable ship to stay on grid for as long as possible then?  Frigs are out of the question I guess since frig duals are normally over in a matter of seconds.  Cruisers maybe? Only these function almost exactly like battlecruisers but without an MJD which means kiters are a serious problem.  I don't think anyone with an ounce of sanity would suggest battleships to a new solo pvper.  Ram jags will get nuked by a hurricane or brutix.  They usually live until their ADC decycles and then they instapop.  If you want more fights and more experience you want a ship with a larger engagement profile.  That's a battlecruiser my friend.  Nearly everything cruiser sized and below eats shit to a battlecruiser.
---
I would wager that a single player on a roam isn't creating the content that a sieged rorqual is. There are hundreds and hundreds of rorqual kills with 100-200 dudes and massive brawls that happened because of it. I think people really devalue what a rorqual represents in the big whale hunt and escalation that follows.
---
No that was your “war” in the north where they didn’t undock.

You clearly don’t read.  Fucking spodbrain.

We have skill injectors at home.

Being gay is not actually a crime in Russia. "Spreading gay propaganda to children" is. Which is a whole lot weirder, as it implies that one can "catch gayness" or "change their mind to become gay" etc. And the while "spreading" is even better, as apparently being openly gay is already that. Russian government figures, who make decisions for the entire country, seem to think that if a child from supposedly "traditional" society sees an openly gay person, they would immediately go "oh my that is so cool" and will switch to being gay on the spot. XD
---
Kys in game please
---
This logic doesn't work. If I use RL$ to subscribe, say, 10 accounts, and go full rorqual with them, I'm accruing "organic harms of null pve accounts" in exactly the same way as the PLEXing multiboxer. I'm injecting the same amount of cash and/or minerals into the economy than the PLEXer, and I'm providing less money to CCP to boot due to the 25% lower cost of subscribing (and that's before the further discounts that may occur due to subscribing for more than one month at a time.)
---
Not even 1 dumbfuck
---
I did. Just pointing out if people wanted mines it needs to be completely random and expensive.
---
Seconded. The flying rust gun I'd a great starter ship
---
Sure, but more rorquals doesn't equate to more content, whereas more pvp pilots does.
---
What the fuck is a wife beater?
---
What's so special about hangar items? Is the tens of trillions of ISK available for loot in Delve alone from our myriad facilities not enough? What kind of payout do you think is needed to get wars started?
---
Tanky Phantasm.
---
It’s more sad they wanna argue with people reporting it from the front lines.  Like what’s being done here.  
---
It’s also sad that the most consequential assets (ihubs) are less than 500m isk meaning they barely register on KBs.  
---
Also from dotlan one can easily see by looking at those regions that fighting over ihubs is occurring.  What started out (and continues) as suicide against a cyno jammed wall has turned into a slow burn of tearing into the wall piece by piece, brick by brick... if you will.  By flipping ihubs you prevent jammer usage.  Enough systems without jammers can then allow for the war to process more effectively.  
---
Right now the heroes are the subcaps and the Entosis going on for the ihubs.
---
&gt; Skilling Spree
---
CCP has this event where if you're actually dumb, you can PVE for SP and get less sp per hour then if you just did any other activity.
---
That right, 10 cents of skill points and all you have to do is log in and do state sanctioned dumbthing daily, because you're dumb, which is why you did level 4 missions for four years.
---
This is as valuable if not better than resource wars. Remember to log in today.
---
In other news, if EVE isn't successful this year, the reigns for the first time are taken away from CEO Hilmar, famous for squandering all the revenue on developing vr/mobile games to the point of shitcanning everyone in the CCP family to make the financials look good.
---
What a tragedy that would be.
---
So, rorquals haven't created any content by being targets in the last 3 years?
---
You spelled 100mn phantasm wrong

p3ak decided not to kill this alliance, so they left   thats the story, frat gets to live

shrapnel bombs should do this...

Skill injectors at home: [expired cerebral accelerator]

Eh I guess it’s fine for you.
---
That would make a lot of sense. Like it unleashes a blast that hits everything within 100km and decloaks anything hit.
---
Nah I’ll keep posting just for you princess
---
No that's about a day and a half or so.
---
&gt; It’s more sad they wanna argue with people reporting it from the front lines.
---
Most of the time, the front line grunts actually have no idea what's going on. The koolaid drinkers generally can't see past the narrative that their command tells them.
---
So congrats, you reffed some Ihubs. Just make sure you tune in to the next SOTA or whatever so you can hear uncle sappo tell you you're winning.
---
True, they get evicted when a bigger fish wants something. Most recently in my memory is pl kicking their teeth in to grab all the outposts before the outposts to faction citadel conversion. 
---
CVA is spicy though. They may be smaller, but there's no one more experienced in fighting back continuously when everyone keeps punching you in the face. I respect CVA and what they've been able to hold onto. 
---
Every time you roam into CVA territory, shoot a few people, they will give you a response and it's not a supercap umbrella type response. Last night a few corrections members on a roam in Loki's got a gnosis in response, then a nightmare, curse and a few other support ships.
---
Escalation running is relatively safe. anoms with current cyno-covercyno and insta locking bombers? Almost immposible to escape if hunter is not an idiot :D
---
1 year is roughly 20m SP so... that means after 20m you start to not give a shit?  I think that’s a bit off.  
---
And I’m the dumbfuck.  Ok princess.
---
A specific Barghest fit (Ravens/RNIs also work) that sits 400km from a Wormhole site and just runs FoF Missiles to autokill the rats, bitters use cloaks and MJDs to keep them super safe.
---
Arataka is also about figuring out what is coming from a story perspective and figuring out the lore. They have both in character and out of character chats. Great group of people. Best of all, you don't have to be in an arc corp to roll with them.
---
&gt; But when they pump isk and minerals into the game, directly or indirectly causing proliferation, inflation, faucets, lack of content due to proliferated umbrellas, and more, they become more harmful to the game than beneficial. 
---
I don't disagree with you there but that's not what I was talking about. You didn't originally provide a lot of context so I assumed bottom line ++ CCP income.
---
The problem isn't people PLEXing (which is what I thought you were saying) harms the game and multiple RORQ accounts don't hurt CCPs bottom line (quite the opposite).
---
The problem is first Skill Point trading. These ships had a retarded train time before injectors. You could have created a multibox train for these ships but you probably wouldn't want to wait a year or two at 12 bucks a month per pilot. I mean someone would do it but the reward would be too far down the road for most of us, even guys with money.
---
The second is they made the rorqs easy to save when tackled and made them out mine small fleets of barges (I know because I do multibox but I do it with barges and a boosting ship). IIRC unboosted it takes six Procs to outdo a rorq with double MLUs. so a 10 box rorq is outmining a fleet of 60 off barges all at level 5 T2 strips and drones and sacrificing tank for the extra MLU.
---
So the rorq is definitely broken. I'd like to see panic deleted but the excav and hull costs should drop as well. Not a huge amount but enough that losing a ship wouldn't discourage someone from risking it again.
---
I don't blame CCP for trying. I like the moon ores requiring actual effort and to mine the same amount of goo as a month of passive mining provided, you do need to hit each goo type with a rorq or a barge fleet on a once a month cycle that has to be cleared in two days. Maybe a longer despawn would help and locking the laser until the despawn or all ore is mined. just kicking the idea; haven't really thought it through.

Criterion is recruiting!

Mining in null is safer than just about anything other than brick tanked orca highsec mining.
---
You need to do it under a super umbrella though, right now the only umbrella offering serious protection is Delve and Esoteria, although PanFam might use their supers now that the big bad GOONS are gone home.
---
I'm not the one saying space is safe and then complaining about getting demolished by people dropping a sledge hammer on my face when I take a 5 man gang into a space filled with 45k people that don't like me.
---
I mean 100mn is way better, but again not for a newbro.
---
Forget the meta, this is just a weird niche application.
---
Yes
---
Renting is really not plausible anymore without local. If you want access to null I would instead highly recommend join Goons, panfam, test or if all else fails FRT and enjoy their super cap umbrellas so you can use the space you live safely, if you're smart about it.
---
Otherwise its a waste of isk because nobody will undock once they've been ganked a few times.
---
i feel you man, i once ate a bwonie and it was just a normal brownie

That's not even close to what I said, please don't put words in my mouth.

nah, eve doesnt have 100 players, its actualy 4 bots and one real player who buys their isk
---
TDs are a little wishy-washy with frigates... often you're better off just swarming and overwhelming your targets
---
there are few situations where a TD is going to get you a victory where you wouldn't have gotten it anyway
---
My general experience is PROJECTION == SPEED &gt; BUFFERTANK &gt; DAMAGE
---
which I summarize neatly as "grid presence". ships with grid presence get to where they need to be, they don't die on their way, and they can get their damage out without needing much to go in their favor. this makes them very easy to FC
---
Things like MWD blaster boats tend to be more of a "fly your own ship" kind of fleet. You can't reasonably tell everyone what to do at every moment, you can't really expect people to anchor to you. You just GO and DO... and hope you don't make a bad call forcing your fleet to MWD for an extra 10 seconds while they struggle to get in the happy zone
---
Join Brave, Horde or Karmafleet with one of your accounts.  Leave the other to make isk like you are now.  Get 100 tackle slashers or condors and try to lose them all in a month.  Should cost you about 1/4 the cost of a Gila hull.
---
Yet people have an expectation that they can cloak and nullify and hunt in relative safety. Boggles my mind.
---
I 'm quite fresh so I don't know, why the community doesn't like dailies ?
---
So... someone may RANDOMLY get a 50,000 SP challenge each day of the Skilling Spree, while someone else may RANDOM only get the 10,000 SP challenge?
---
Panfam definitely has their super umbrella up.   The moved to a much tighter collection of regions to defend for just that purpose.
---
Nice.
---
Any decent null group will help with logistics.  Orca won’t be practical to move, just sell it.  Sounds like maybe that mining group you’re in will buy it from you?  
---
What I did when I moved to null was sell the bigger stuff.  Set up pushX to consolidate stuff in Amarr.  Had the alliance freight service run the stuff out to their space.  Expect this to cost roughly 100m or so depending on the M3.  
---
Then I just did the ole change my death clone to their home space staging citadel and self destruct your pod and wake up in 0.0.  It’s a 5 second trip!  
---
But ask LOTS of questions.  What’s the culture like?  What are the fleet requirements?  How do people make isk?  How has blackout affected things?  What wars are you in?   Are there mentor programs?  
---
If you’re new expect to feel some frustration being at the lower end SP wise. Many of the doctrine ships and fits require a decent training time.  They’ll find you something to do but it won’t be blingy (which is fine as it can be overwhelming and takes some time getting acclimated).
---
Are you just going to keep posting on every comment about the test vs. frat "war"?
---
If you're new and care a lot about your skill advancement, it's pretty nice I guess.
---
For a lot of us, it's meh, but it's not *for* people like us. CCP just gave rich lazy bastards like us about half a million SP per account each. I feel like we don't get to complain.
---
You said that more rorquals does not equal more content. As more is a metric of quantity, we could infer that you mean less rorquals will also not impact content because they are not pvp pilots. So, zero rorquals in space would not equal less content? I mean, you are saying that a single pvp pilot hurfing about is more content that some whale that 200 nerds can pile on. That's an arrogant statement to want to say "but I'm more important than that dude because I fly around in my frigate".
---
This is precisely why all fights should be taken! Hate risk averse anything. Just brawl it out, don't care about dying. GF
---
The fuck harm does it do anyone?
---
Threatening to close down your 20 accounts, how original. See you in 2 months when RL gets too boring.
---
These wouldnt be totally overpowered or abused in anyway imaginable.
---
Please do this!!!!!!
---
Hmmm... one of my alts I killed the 5 NPCs on for 25,000 SP, but didn't get the SP. The UI just sits there saying, "Unallocated Skill Points Added."
---
Seems a bit buggy.
---
Wow, I looked at the fit, and first thought when I saw him in warp was, he is going to die. A lil surprised he made it out.
---
All pilots using a structure need to experience the risk. It's really as simple as that. I don't hate AFK pilots or pilots who prefer PVE like some of the "elite" combat pilots who regularly hate on PVE but if you're going to move to dangerous space (or whatever the warning is at the high to null gate) then you need to assume there's a certain risk of losing stuff in your structure.
---
If you had a POS and that POS was killed, you lost everything in it. Not just POS guns and some BPCs and components. You lost your SMY, Corp array, etc and all of the contents. If you had a family emergency and came back to find your shit pushed in, that was just the breaks you had to deal with. If you weren't AFK, you had a chance to evac your stuff if you were smart enough to stront.
---
Yes, stations were indestructible but even then, you probably had to discount your shit for more than the 15% ransom of today, get someone to move it to safety (which involved risking its loss) at a significant cost, or wait until you took it back.
---
You thought you were going to be able to farm several hundred thousand SP a day while doing anoms? For a month?
---

Daily quests are here.
---
Inb4 "eve is turning into WoW" Reeeeeee
---
How many SP for a HK keepstar?
---
You would think that at first, but you have forgotten all about CCP Round
---
Of course not. Just some more creativity into the assignments.
---
Mine as well. One of the reasons for the umbrella is the practical uncatchable hunter fleets. I'd like to see a weapons timer or going through a cyno disable the cloak on a ship for several minutes. I'm not really worried about nullification, though.
---
A very blinged out Rev with drugs and no neut pressure can tank upwards of 40k for a long, long time.
---
You spelt Stuka wrong 👍
---
Well it depends, you make some massive leveling change, people that leave will leave and the game will become more dynamic.
---
The other option is GOONS continuing to become more incrementally powerful until nullsec is only GOONS.
---
I agree punishment for success is not a great idea, but neither is watching the game die a long, drawn out death.  
---
Right now, the only sov warfare that will occur is the warfare GOONS allow.  That is not healthy and takes away anything other than "fun roams" from the game.
---
The ADC did nothing.
---
I still burn prop mods in seconds with 5. I need to train adv thermo.
---
With respect to the above the cloaked and nullified ship offers the pilot relative safety. The cost in isk is irrelevant. He also only generates content for himself, unless he screws up.
---
ok retard
---
&gt; But im afraid to lose my ships..what should do i do?
---
Boy have I got great news for you. In null commonplace is to bro-out with tens of thousands of other dudes in mega coalitions to reduce the chances of you losing ships. It's like highsec level traffic, but everyone is your friend.
---
Yes.
---
It’s been said before, but Neocom II
---
It’s freaking amazing
---
Yeah but it isnt really there, if goons parked one of their super fleets up north, that umbrella would stop responding while Delve would continue to operate.
---
So while PanFam has an umbrella, it's only there because GOONS allows it.
---
Legacy is probably in the same boat, but we are more likely to be allowed to keep ours running due to better relations.
---
Well it’s the whole losing a flight of excavators and 2-3 hulks in the blink of an eye to decloaking on grid bombers that sorta sap the fun out of what I used to do primarily.   Changing tacs to primarily PvP now and unsubbing the krab first accounts has been a decent change of pace and has definitely had an affect on my logged in time as well.  Used to be I’d be logged in most of the day and mine an hour here hour there.  Few hours after the kiddos go to bed.  I’d pick up a modest 50m m3 of mined ore and ice a month.  That’s casually paced with a rorq and 3 exhumers.  
---
Now... yeah not wanting to feed shit to the campers so if I realistically can’t be on coms and active I’m just gonna not be logged in.  Now I’ll log in for an hour in the evening... maybe... and roam in a stratios or join a fleet if that’s going on.  
---
I might also be inspired to start this deck rebuild that I’ve been putting off... I have that pesky laundry room to retile too... some of that looking more appealing than watching my hard earned isk go up in smoke.
---
I'm getting some cupcakes this weekend with my roommate and I'm trying to explain this to him, he's never had edibles and thinks I'm fucking with him. It should be an interesting evening.
---
I referred to the rev fit in the killmail and it tanks 16 without heat.
---
Dread and FAX self tanks have been inflated to deal with additional damage from capital proliferation, but none of the subs have their damage adjusted to deal with this.
---
Just as long as its not another fucking mining event I'm happy enough letting people farm their alts tbh.
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=wife%20beater
---
How about we don't do this, and instead stop using cancerous mobile game mechanics to inflate login numbers
---
its blackout days, so nobody is farming anything, wait some time untill ccp realises they are going bankrupt and restores the local chat
---
That dual ASB phantasm that you linked is pure trash btw.  Trash dps.  No web means range control and application on smaller targets will be an issue.  You even admit to not having actually flown one.  Don't suggest stupid fits like that to someone that you've not even used yourself.  100mn would be easier to fly than that monstrosity you linked.
---
I dunno about that. Bombers can easily do 700 or 800. Non bling Cerberus' do 600 to 700. There are a lot of things that do a lot of damage. But rail gun snipe HACs are not one of them.
---
&gt;All pilots using a structure need to experience the risk.
---
Why? All this does is add busywork shuttling items from NPC stations to structures for no gain to anyone. It utterly fails to actually add any risk.
---
But wow dailies can actually pay out officer level gear by comparison, where as CCP is more concerned with being covetous long-nosed muggles
---
If you stop and think... living in WH is actually easier...
---
Your “gates” change daily/hourly and you can even roll them to HS or LS of your liking... meaning you can always keep valuables in Amarr or jita or Dixie and utilize your static’s to access what you need.  
---
No cyno risk.  
---
You control the escalation.  Since you can build anything in system, you can always build bigger than what an invader can bring in.  
---
The rewards are better (or the same)
---
No pesky complicated intel networks to maintain, sov to pay, etc
---
Literally now the only difference is asset safety but it sounds like that’s going to be copy pasted onto null sec life too so I’m expecting 0.0 to really start to become a hard sell to potential recruits.
---
Depends where you are. But yep you will lose less in a Corp doing pvp.... pve not so much if he is just mining and doing missions null will be spendy
---
Jews btw or non-magic folk if you will
---
It’s almost like they don’t even think this shit thru huh
---
You should return for the romp of blackout haha
---
Can't we just get progressive challenge where you get more skillpoints the more NPC's you destroy? E.g. 25 ships for 10k, 100 for 25k and 250 for 50k?
---
Woah get the fuck right outta here with that logical thought.
---
Ofc it's trash.
---
It's also perfect for this.
---
DPS doesn't matter to learn, kills don't matter to learn.
---
Range control? Please. It's a Phantasm. The only frigate that's getting away after it gets scrammed is a dual prop/web , Daredevil, or succubus. And again - kills don't matter for learning. 
---
Hard to fly? What? Turn on invulns and ab - pulse an xlasb as necessary, fly around and shoot stuff.
---
Tank tons of shit so you can stay on grid and learn. Easy peasy.
---
I meant that overall subcap DPS has not been adjusted for the buffs to Dread rep/Fax rep, which makes subs overall even shittier at killing caps than before. There's high damage/high Neut subs that can do it a lot better but even they can't do it as well as they used to due to capital cap boosters.
---
No you can’t have nice things.  I can because I pray to RNGesus.
---
GOD. My meme suits this dude better. My dream killmail
---
Let’s hope it’s one so wormholes who don’t pve actually have a chance
---
Upvoted
---
&gt; modest 50m m3 of mined ore and ice a month
---
Dude, that's an insane amount. If I mine hard when my R32 pops, I can gather 3-5m M3 in the two days and that's netting me somewhere in the 3bil range?
---
If you lose some excavs and a couple of exhumers to a bombing run, it's still not putting a dent in your wallet.
---
 I know you didn't say moon ore but 50 million m3 of hemorphite (hardly the best isk/m3 ore is still 10 bill isk. Gneiss would almost double that.
---
Honestly, you can afford to lose some excavs from time to time although it would get pricey if it was constant.
---
That's what Supercarriers (Motherships) did back in the day.
---
If I'm not mistaken Titans still have this ability, but it's never used as you can just Titan bridge a fleet which is much easier and safer.
---
Ok, you clearly don't know what you're talking.
---
&gt;That fit is a disaster
---
Bro, they are owned by Pearl Abyss. Idk why you didn't expect to see this stuff creep into the game.
---
The combination of both is my problem. At some point, if blackout is permanent, they will nerf one or both. Hillmar has already called out nullification's cousin, the warp core stab.
---
its depressing to see my favourite corp die. 
---
birdsquad #1 forever
---
The real #1 rule of eve. 
---
These things we fly mean nothing.
---
The faster you understand this, the closer you are to winning Eve. They are but mere tools used to harvest the salt of your enemies.
---
Do you mind explaining the story behind ? Who engaged ?
---
Insert scanning alt, bash down structures, put up your own, sell it off w/ structures. Usually a third party will hold the cash until the transaction is complete.
---
Unaugmented rate of SP/hr for an Omega clone is 1800 SP/hr. This means that 10,000 (the lowest tier reward during skilling spree) gives 5.5 hours worth of free SP
---
Skilling spree is from July 24th to August 21st which is 29 days. So that means if you get the lowest reward tier every day for the event you will save 6.6 days of training time throughout the event.
---
Are they on the same account?
---
I'm using a RS with 1 heavy grappler and 1 web for solo Triglavian invasion. My drone option I have been using is either 2 Berzerkers or 1 Gecko, but notice a problem with increased missing the frigate drones even when they are reduced to 50-90 mps. Am I reducing the enemy's speed too much (effectively under my drone guns); what speed should I try to create? Any other general advice? (Using RLHM and the drone(s))
---
Small gang players have been told to adapt or die for the past several years by the big blocs and now that its time for the big blocs to adapt they whine and bitch about any semblance of change that could shake up their playstyle.
---
No they are not. Two separate accounts.
---
Yeah but in 6Hrs I can make enough isk to get a couple of injectors...
---
Oh wait...  sleeper NPCs count for this huh?
---
:BIG_THONK:
---
Don't bother null is dead, hi sec for comfort or a wormhole for a challenge is where it's at.
---
Garmur and orthrus my dude. Best solo ships in the game if properly flown. 
---
For up close and personal succubus and phantasm are sex
---
Instead of playing a game that slowly turns to wow, why dont play wow :D I do that and I have something to do all the time
---
And so it turns out to be a great disappointment, unfortunately. 20hrs for next kill. Hehehe I was ready to kill for hours today. LoL
---
Because how else are you supposed to scam newbies?
---
You misunderstand the premise. 
---
It takes 2 minutes to save 6 hours of training time.
---
&gt;  NPC stations to structures for no gain to anyone.
---
Well for one thing, you guys are not exactly unique but not really common in that you have those stations close by. For another shuttling stuff back and forth can be risky, so there's that.
---
In any case, you have a raw 20% chance of losing something. are you risk averse enough that that would make you decide to put your shit in storage until use? I can't imagine you or pretty much anyone else being that set back by a 20% chance you lose something. It means that you have pretty good odds (80%) of NOT losing something.
---
Could you not just go to LS and setup Indy there? They still have local  go forth you crazy crab and make me my ships
---
Given they are experimenting with local blackout it seems like a great way of skewing your data in favour of your preferred outcome.
---
what's preventing you from fitting some tank and a cyno on that ratting battleship of yours?
---
The "larger" issues that were being complained about from pvpers like us vs the Krab umbrella meta gaming?
---
Yes, you are right. It doesn't solve all of them. But we all really like it, and it was about time a bone was thrown to us.
---
And btw, by pvper, I don't mean "I only pvp in home defense fleets and StratOPs lead by my coalition." I'm talking about non-bloc level pvp.
---
People who krab in passive C5 rattlesnakes deserve whats coming to them.
---
&gt; the warp core stab
---
I hate those with the heat of a thousand suns. They should either delete them, let them be used only on ships of industry, or at the bare minimum make them offline all offensive mods and lock the drone bay while installed (installed, not just offline).
---
I expected it to come later, after they finished ished refining the boob jiggle on the French maid outfits they'll release for our spaceships.
---
Only 10k plex each!
---
They tried daily's long before being bought too
---
Who are they again?
---
Dude, you can't win with this sub or CCP, they are all chanting burn as the ship goes down. All the while saying it's revolutionary, and a long time coming. What a joke.
---
Pearl Abyss didn't make this event, CCP did.
---
It's for killing NPCs, why would it be not for NPC kills in wspace? And it's an insignificant amount really
---
Just disappointing.  What else is new I guess
---
Want to know what what desperation looks like? 
---
Free skill points by the truckload.
---
A properly fitted Deimos is a lot more expensive than 4 Brutii.
---
It’s one of those ships that becomes utterly disgusting with a full deadspace tank, askleps and drugs but is fairly mediocre when T2 fitted. If you’re going to do a Deimos properly you’re flying 1.5b-2b worth of ship and 1.5b-3b worth of implants and you will get fuck all in insurance when it blows up.
---
Feel free to post a better one, cupcake
---
My dude you obviously don't know shit about null.... the big boys are farming lots under their capital umbrellas.
---
Let me put it this way: if we got any wind of asset safety being nerfed, I'd push for a complete, unilateral unanchoring of every structure we own before the drop date, to force all line member assets into asset safety before it is removed. Or, at least, as many major structures as is feasible. It'd be a big ask. We can reanchor later. I'd also ask CCP to split the tether and docking privileges on ACLs so we can provide safe areas for supers to log off at, but not to dock.
---
Why endure ANY risk, when you can spend effort to reduce it to zero? If you can't understand this, I'd recommend installing an actual human empathy module in your skull, or deferring such intelligence tasks to a person better suited to understand such things.
---
Also, you'd see mass migrations of players to space near NPC stations. Space not near NPC stations would become completely empty.
---
I am not saying all cases where you pay $ that money justifies the organic harms. But it becomes harder to evaluate, and perhaps there are cases in which the money does actually justify the harms.
---
My point is when you are plexing, there is no scenario where your contribution justifies the organic harms.
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

We don't have infinite sites and our rats will absolutely destroy anything that's not meant to kill them
---
&gt; Most of the time, the front line grunts actually have no idea what's going on. The koolaid drinkers generally can't see past the narrative that their command tells them.
---
Probably have a better idea than some scrub on reddit who isn't involved. its almost like every single alliance isn't exactly the same, Test high command have been really good as of late with keeping us updated on progress even when it isn't obvious. 
---
Fuck it, you do you, keep on with your blind autism and thinking you know better than everyone else.
---
Liberal use of the word "almost".
---
CCP: "Sike! made you log in and undock!"
---
lol @ p3ak retards jumping around fotm alliances. Next stop is the initiative I suppose.
---
I realize that might be the perception.  It’s mostly anom ore in the shittier true sec systems (unbonused yield).  The moons we hold aren’t awesome for moon ores.  
---
Assuming all 50m was gneiss that would be 12b a month and I can assure you I had a ton of ochre in that :)
---
&gt;But im afraid to lose my ships..what should do i do?
---
Start by taking some ships to lowsec and losing them. You should be inured to loss in pretty short order. If you find you can't lose ships without rage quitting, then moving to null (dangerous space) may not be for you.
---
It's fun to move to null, get blown up, and blow other people up. 
---
Oh and any corp that takes you in just as a farmer is probably not very good and you'll end up used and abused. I'd suggest getting into one where you will be supported for PVE but also taught how to pvp and lose ships without rage. Did I mention Dreddit is recruiting?
---
Because it takes away from one of the subtler selling points of Eve, namely that you don't have to login and grind "XP" (SP in this case) to avoid falling behind since you train the same whether you're online or off.  There's no "treadmill to burnout" that way.  Injectors kinda broke that already by making it so there's always something more to grind for, but if you don't partake in that market you can kinda ignore it.  Dailies are harder to avoid.
---
Also, they tend to be PvE focused since it's pretty hard to create a daily for PvP in a sandbox, which rubs people the wrong way since this is supposed to be a PvP MMO, not a boar farming game.
---
It's trivial to scan out to a low class hole and nuke 5 rats. You don't even have to finish the wave. Please don't try to sell this as some attack on wspace and CCP hates everyone that lives there.
---
Guys guys, and then he said "Report them" AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
Haha hey my dude
---
If your drones are out-tracking themselves, speeding up their target is unlikely to help. It may be, however, that you're encountering diminishing returns from the webbing. Maybe try a paint instead?
---
only the cream of the corp, regular old line member scrubs are being told to take holiday from work to keep ADMs up .... lel
---
Then don't do it? 
---
If you play every day, you get a small reward, yay for you.
---
If you don't, you don't. 
---
This isn't hurting anyone or making the game worse, it's a fast way for new players to get some SP, which I support fully.
---
So... the most effective way to make isk *if that's all you care about* is to get another IRL job and buy plex. I don't recommend that. It's just something to compare against. Ask yourself what you enjoy doing that also makes isk on the side.
---
As an incentive to keep striving for higher rank?  I believe that's encouraging to healthy behavior.
---
&gt; frat gets to live
---
We'll see. 
---
Although, tbh, I hope they do. They're fun to fight, I don't really want this war to end.
---
It's also possible that everyone gets the same challenges, just in a different order?
---
&gt; Test high command have been really good as of late with keeping us updated on progress even when it isn't obvious.
---
The lack of self-awareness here is astounding. Of course they've kept you "up to date on progress". They're going to tell you what they want you to hear so they can keep up morale. If the war was going nowhere, they wouldn't straight up tell you that. If they told everyone that their effort wasn't producing any results, people would stop showing up for fleets.
---
''Each day, pilots will receive one of three randomly selected challenges at during daily downtime that offer either 10,000, 25,000 or 50,000 skill points as a reward for destroying NPC vessels.''
---
Damn LP opportunists. No loyalty, just profit!
---
Disgusting! Choosd a side and own it, turncoat!
---
About your question:
---
You can spin any plex, just not take the system. So you'll be paid for your "service". Hope you can sleep with "collaberating with slavers" on your conscience.
---
Following your logic: eating more food doesn't make you more healthy. Thus, we can infer that eating less food also doesn't make you less healthy. So eating 0 food would keep you as healthy as you are presently.
---
If you insist on me spelling out my argument in painstaking detail, then there is an optimal number of rorquals out after which space is saturated (like your stomach) and adding more rorquals doesn't generate an appreciable amount of new content, even though it has significant negative consequences (capital proliferation bla bla).
---
Dude caldari and amarr are allies.
---
But...it was yummy...
---
Lots of wormhole corps recruiting. They might even be able to rehab all the reeeee-ing out of you.
---
True, but the cloaked and nullified ship also poses no threat. In order to pose a threat, it has to decloak and light a cyno, at which point it is usually introduced to the warm hospitality of a supercapital response fleet.
---
Strawman. Thanks.
---
I want to move a alt to be closer to home but want to do fw I am most curious if I have to join amarr or being in caldari is good enough
---
Thanks to  [**Uriel Anteovnuecci**](https://twitter.com/anteovnuecci) on twitter.
---
Man I totally misunderstood your title; I thought you meant they were now race options for your characters.
---
Except a real new player will die a ton trying this
---
Yeah, uh, the method of payment for your subscription in no shape or way makes your "contributions" matter more or less. A player who puts the money out of his or her own pocket doesn't purchase some sort of Contribution Credit, akin to a carbon emissions credit, along with their sub. What one chooses to do with their account is what matters. I can do exactly as much good or harm with the 20th account whether I pay out of my own pocket or buy PLEX from the market. 
---
Besides, account time isn't the only thing you can do with PLEX. A RL$ customer can still purchase PLEX in-game for stuff like skill extractors, skins, MCTs, etc. This drives up the cost of PLEX without any attendant "organic harms of null pve accounts."
---
Not sure if this is the same fit they are talking about but this is the only combat heron ive ever killed: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/43757192/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/43757192/)
---
Is this on a per-character basis, or is the challenge per account?
---
I hope per account, I would lose my mind doing it for every character...
---
Ship are like anmo; dont be affraid to lose your ship.
---
then promptly lost them all in the few weeks before they got changed.
---
I believe he was referring to how retaining broken content affects the development team and community's own culture.  On the development side, it's difficult to maintain an emphasis on quality overall when there are horribly broken features that are permitted to exist.  The community is more inclined to spew caustic behavior out of a lack of respect for the product and players who play it.
---
&gt; CCP has this event where if you're actually dumb, you can PVE for SP and get less sp per hour then if you just did any other activity.
---
As a newbro, how? My understanding is you can do literally any activity and as long as you kill one npc you get 10k sp for the day during Skilling Spree but can get up to 50k.
---
Time for capsuleers to pick a side CCP?
---
That would be epic
---
No, I'm trying to say you're the one blatantly constructing a strawman from my argument.
---
I made statement A (more rorqs != good). You then said 'ah, so you are saying B'! (no rorqs != bad), which is obviously incorrect. That's a strawman
---
Snuff corps had enough of Vertiso causing mining drama so they took off.  There is only so much crying about moongoo you can listen to from a low level Argos employee like Vert.
---
Lol why not like it makes any difference
---
But your parents are anti-vacs
---
Yes, you can run any plex in any FW system and be paid. Flipping AM/MIN systems to your faction won't work though, but you're only interested in LP from plexes, so it doesn't matter.
---
A/B testing?
---
The russians did
---
yeah you're right, we haven't taken any of their systems, haven't reff'd a bunch more, haven't been stomping them in fights, haven't reduced their fleet numbers through being better than them and we definitely haven't caused them to move a bunch of their mega krabs out to drones. 
---
nope none of that happened ...
---
49,999.901 SP then.
---
I AM #TEAMDRIFTER HOW ABOUT U?
---
Do you know if I am paid from my Corp for any plex or from the amarr Corp for their plexes?
---
I'm still waiting for Drifter clothing. I know, super shallow, but man those suits are awesome.
---
double bet
---
i and many others do. never waited longer then 72hrs to get my shit moved by public courer contracts and they are much cheaper than established freight groups. average is more like 48hrs if you are stingy with the rewards.
---
\*audible laugh\*

Aww da whittle renter gonna get farmed

Love the bait/battle heron vids dude made a bunch of them and they are all hilarious  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir910TNwcdw
---
T1 Frigate, warp to random belt in High sec.
---
Or those of us reffing the fucking ihubs but whatever man
---
I do not. LP are granted from the faction for your service... bot your corp.
---
Do you mean, if you get CAL LP or AM LP? Good question...
---
I don't know, but I'd say... depends on the warzone.
---
Let us know, I'd be interested.
---
to be fair, that fit can do  sleeper information sanctums.
---
PVE is still boring AF.   Bribing me with a handful of SP just ain't gonna make me grind.
---

not in today's eve. you can poop out a titan every 16 days. you have armies of rorquals. the days these things took effort to build are long gone. there are people that build supers entirely on their own, from mining minerals to researching blueprints. 
---
and even if it were like that, it's a horrible argument to balance something and it is incosistently applied.
---
c'mon now, the autism chariot was 2b...
---
also that autism chariot would net 450m off 3 sites (had I chose not to do the drifter). Content is content.
---
Nah I feel you, it adds more flavour to the game, and honestly RP could do with more options for players, it's a big pull for some players.
---
Blackout is a weird time, I was helping Darkness hold a super the other day.
---
Event quest has 5 steps.
---
Maybe it'll roll over after 5?  Gonna guess it's just the 5 steps though.
---
I never said it didn't. Just don't believe everything command tells you, because if it isn't flat out wrong, it's usually not completely true either.
---
I'm sure test is making progress. Test blobs the fuck out of everyone so it's no surprise they're doing it to frat too. But reffing Ihubs doesn't really mean shit.
---
"I am not a well they," good shit.
---
Grind? You pop into one anomaly, belt, and kill a rat or 5. 5 minutes or less and you're done.
---
Yes but that "broken content" is not the fault of the player base but that of CCP not putting effort into fixing it. We shouldn't have to lose content that many people do enjoy because it's easier than fixing it..
---
It is constant, cause bombers don’t give up.
---
Get rid of faxes. 
---
End transmission. 
---
Period. 
---
Over and out.
---
Its rare for a single person to build a titan. More commonly is a single person buys materials and builds the titan. Profiting off the difference.
---
He's saying that you'd get more so by grinding isk and buying injectors, but he's saying that as a more established player. For a new dude, whatever go shoot some triangles for 5 minutes and get 6 hours of skill, NBD. Don't listen to the salty oldbros who forgot how to have fun.
---
how do you get the challenge?
---
&gt; So while PanFam has an umbrella, it's only there because GOONS allows it. 
---
Yes and no.   It's because there's a post-Drifter Blue Donut non-invasion pact in place covering pretty much all of null.
---
I fully expect Panfam and friends (and legacy) are using this time to bulk up on their supercap fleets.
---
We are talking about being a rentier here. Try building good efficient pve ship to fight blobs GL.
---
Idk I think they would lol it started out that way.  We hit the cyno jammer wall and they were pretty open about that.  
---
It’s really too bad you think we’re all stupid spod brains and can’t think for ourselves. Lack of respect for sure
---
He seems to also ignore that just about every isk making activity aside from market pvp will involve killing SOME npcs.
---
Even mining. Since belt rats will be around.
---
Yes because there’s so much ignorance on here it’s needed.

Incorrect, that ship can be armed with all manner of guns to kill many ships/drones/mtus/anything that generates a killmail to it's heart's content. If your saying a nullified ship should not be capable of being armed, I agree.

Well, 50,000 SP in about 10 minutes is the equivalent of about 600m/hr if you get a full value skill injection...

who?
---
Please stop telling every new null sec person to join one of these groups. This kind of suggestion is a contributing factor to stagnation in nullsec. New players should go to the recruitment channel, forum, or /r/evejobs and find a match for them.
---
Not trying to attack you personally as I've suggested these corps in the past. The thing is, null would benefit from smaller groups not all aligned rather than 3 big groups. And while people may think where noobs go is insignificant, how can new/smaller groups grow if 9/10 new players go straight to one of the big 3.
---
No, but it would be nice if game mechanics would support a limited amount of dual boxing for ISK making (and mining, to a degree).     
---
Like Carrier ratting.     
---
If every ratter was using 1 carrier instead of (up to) dozens of afk drone boats, the economy would be in a much better state.      
---
Same for mining. I would like to see 1 Rorq per belt (or per player maybe) and then barges.     
---
I don't have a problem with someone multiboxing Mackinaws or retrievers. Rorquals are cancer.
---
It's more so work vs grind. If you math it out vs price of 500 plex you get something closer to 150m isk/h worth of sp assuming it takes 3 minutes to log in daily with 11k average sp reward. 
---
In short, if you're not impoverished or a free player, you probably shouldn't log in for a month for 1/6th of a plex. But it's a nice bonus if you were logging in doing pve stuff anyway - which you weren't, because blackout.
---
They are an alliance that spent quite a long time in Venal. Tbh unless you fly around there you prob wouldnt know them but they were fairly active at one point
---
If you move to nullsec you will lose any oportunity to make isk. If that concerns you, then Wormhole is where you want to go.
---
It was always safer in a way, because no cynos. If you had your entrances under control and watched signatures, the danger was some cloakies.      
---
Now, i think, Null might even be more dangerous.
---
Yes, but I think you get your own lp, not amarr
---
Small sized props melt rapidly.  Be careful as they tend take the rest of your mids with them.  Heat management is a minigame in and of itself.  Therm 5 may only buy you one extra prop cycle, but it'll probably buy you 6-10 extra gun cycles depending on how you arranged your weapons and how many there are.
---
You get your own faction lp.
---
Evanova is pretty good.
---
That fact that it's a short duration grind, doesn't make it less grindy.   I'm too busy playing r/Eve to waste my time on that.
---
CCP's real challenge is to make playing Eve more interesting than playing r/Eve.
---
You're not the only one. I had this bug on one of my characters, but the others were all fine.
---
After you kill the npc, the bar says Unallocated Skill Points, but doens't give you any sp. It also doesn't proceed to the message 'Next challenge in X hours'. Just seems stuck.
---
Make sure to submit a bug report.
---
All 6 of my accounts were 1 for 10k.
---
I really miss long down times, 10min sleep a day just don't cut it :/
---
You as an individual don't have to defend space in a big block either.
---
Rechecking my math (math is hard)
---
I generally use https://ore.cerlestes.de/ore
---
50,000,000 cubic meters of bitumens (one of the shit ores)
---
50,000 units (site uses per 1000m3 for calculation)
---
50,000 times 104,791 is roughly 5 bil. Like I said that's for a shit ore.
---
50,000,000 cubic meters of gneiss
---
50,000,000 units of gneiss (for std ore it's calculated per m3)
---
50000000 times 365 is about 18Bil
---
To be clear, these are values determined by the refined value of the ore. It's hard to get good pricing on moon ores for valuation because nobody sells them because they're a PITA to move. refining the ore increases the value of the ore so maybe that's where the discrepancy is.
---
So basically it's either free SP that you're going to get from just doing the things you do, or it's a 5 minute detour from your normal activities to get 150+ mil for basically no effort. Sounds like an easy W to me.
---
I see your concern. Goons have no interest in owning all of null. The Mattani has stated on multiple occasions that he has no interest in abandoning fortress delve or occupying regions in the north. The war with Gotg and the most recent war with NC/PL was about revenge. The vacuum created has allowed for new upcoming groups to make a claim. If that doesn't encourage diversity I don't know what will. Goons don't want the game to die. They are too committed to it.
---
Goons won't go away, with or without a capital nerf. I can't get behind the idea of a nerf when the reasoning ultimately falls on the fear of a super power. They earned that recognition no matter how you look at it. What will be the next nerf be when they realize that their proposal doesn't amount to anything? These radical changes that discredit the hard work of players are not the solution.
---
Thanks 4 info! Feelsbad being almost compelled to do it on shitty alts.

Good luck, INIT!
---
&gt;Frigs and dessies are only ever recommended as a learning tool out of necessity due to idk and sp issues.  
---
&gt;When those problems go away there are absolutely no compelling reasons to learn on them.
---
I tried out low sec PvP with T1 frigates.  I got blobbed a bit at first till I figured out how to spot the most obvious bait/traps, and eventually found out how to get some good fights, many nice 1v1s where I could learn some things.
---
I'm not sure I've ever even heard tell of a nice solo 1v1 battleship fight.  Seem the bigger the ship you bring, the more likely you are to get blobbed. 
---
so there is certainly still come compelling reasons to learn in a frigate/destroyer even if you have the ISK for bigger toys.
---
Sure what kind of rat type are you fighting?
---
To be fair with Eve it's always one or the other isn't it.
---
So basically you just let him know he’s not loved by Elo and norus...
---

---
You display your complete ignorance daily.  The only things that drop are those items attributed to the citadel in its fittings, cargo, fuel, etc.  those other assets attributed to a player but residing in the citadel as a container to go asset safety.
---
Sorry if I was misunderstood, but I wasn't being critical of them, just OCD about the area's history.
---
I actually really like everything about the Provi area.  It seems like what nulsec should be like.
---
News flash falcon commented on reddit a week ago saying asset safety needs to go away from 0.0.  You’re an idiot.
---
Not trolling but last question I guess. Why the hate with blackout? I don't really understand it too well, but isn't it just local not showing everyone in your area?
---
Looks like the snuff corps have 0 activity on zkill.  Spring cleaning
---
It does. I can confirm.
---
So, if you nearly double the time you're going to need to nearly cut the reward in half. But otherwise sure.
---
Spending $5 one time this year at any sale will yield similar results and save you 2-4 hours of time. If you're a krab and grinding regardless it's a bonus. If you weren't going to log in today, don't.
---
Everyone did literally this the last time they did this same exact thing, and basically nobody had issues or complained about it
---
This is such a self sided post. This blackout isnt hurting industrials. The space is still the exact same. The only difference now is you have to DScan
---
People just being people. I'm sure his 30 alts in the c3-hs are being unsubbed over this atrocity
---
It's in the top left corner. If not you have something disabled.
---
Love that Tengu decloaking like an ancient sea monster!
---
I am not saying that PVP is bad or anything, it's pretty neat and I have nothing against it.
---
So I mostly agree with everything you say (Well we have a different view of CODE, but eh).
---
All I'm saying is, if you spend some time on the forums and stuff there seems to be some sort of idea that the "real" Eve is PVP and if you're not going on roams (for whatever reason, maybe you play solo mostly, mayb your corp isn't big enough to effectively PVP, whatever) then somehow you are playing Eve wrong. This is the sentiment I don't understand.
---
But I mean, ultimately I'm gonna do whatever the hell I like and you (the general you, not the specific) should do whatever the hell you wanna do. Neither way of playing the game is more "correct" than the other.
---
Same problem here too.
---
Not disagreeing. That was never the point of my post.
---
Retail is garbage.
---
just like every member in legacy not allowed to be in esoteria right?
---
The term "dinobrain" exists for a reason.
---
Did you even read the post?
---
Yeet yourself
---
How are they free?
---
lol
---
That’s my point the unknown cloaky is equal risk now.  
---
The offset to cynos in null was the fact that you’d know when the cyno lighter was in system.  Maybe he was cloaked in a safe but yeah you knew.  
---
0.0 imo is more risky now
---
I am seriously considering doing the Wormhole thing, it seems like it's actually doable.
---
That said, I am not interested in dissolving my current corp "to learn things". I already know how to play Eve, lots of little details have changed since I played last time, but lots of things are still the same; so I mostly know how to play the game and "learning to run a corp" is kinda the challenge I'm interested in tackling this time. 
---
I am just trying to get some ideas of how to do this and I'm getting lots of useful answers in this thread, so cheers to you guys.
---
That said, a practical question:
---
You mention buying ore from your miners, this was the first thought I had too. Question now becomes, how would I do that? Far as I can tell there are no real way to set up buy orders that only corp members can fulfill. Would you use corp contracts? Would do it some other way?
---
What about tracking? Would whoever is picking up the cans be saddled with also keeping meticulous notes about what rocks were in what can? Are there tools available to track this?
---
Star had nothing to do with it, it was bandwidthh the entire time *obviously*
---
Killmarks in eve predate ED by a few years.
---
&gt; Why the hate with blackout? 
---
This thread wasn't about blackout, just noted that krabs aren't going to be logging in to krab during blackout and this event isn't likely to change that.
---
If you're asking in general, blackout is new, exciting and pretty cool concept for 2019. That being said it appears to result in less undocks overall and less killboard activity overall. It's a cool concept but makes a niche game even more niche.
---
That's this phase, next phase they'll change blackout to only be in effect sometimes or otherwise develop the feature. So you don't need to worry about dead game or anything.
---
&gt; at during
---
Funny thing about that -- CCP Falcon doesn't influence game development direction even a little. His opinions on the subject are worth as much as yours or mine (which is to say, nothing.)
---
Why "spoiler" tag? It's not like we didn't know each race are at each other's troat by this point!
---
Nope. When you destroy an engineering complex or reactor refinery, any job that's currently in progress or complete + undelivered has a 50% chance to drop the inputs and outputs, respectively. If you popped the Tatara in 1DQ1-A, you'd easily make trillions of ISK.
---
Can we get a dual screen wallpaper version of this?
---
Paging u/ccp_falcon
---
&gt;You display your complete ignorance daily
---
When making such claims, it's generally a good idea to not show your own ignorance.
---
Input materials on jobs running in the citadel also drop.  Those are "attributed to a player".  And Querns, despite being an asshole, did specify he was talking about all that input materials in their ECs and refineries.
---
Do you get the 350plex from the refer a friend multiple times? Or just the first time the friend upgrades?
---
And can you get it from multiple friends (either once or repeatedly?)
---
Right but you’d never get that much bitumens from even one moon man.  
---
A lot of that 50m is ochre.  Like maybe 25% because enormous anoms are like stuffed with the shit.  And there’s the isotope ice in that too because people cherry pick.  You can’t just say 50m m3 is all cherry spod/gneiss I must be loaded.   That’s just irresponsible.  
---
Use a compressed value for gneiss as everything is compressed in the rorqual.  
---
Yes the moon ore value comes refined because of the goo and minerals.  We use a t1 rigged athanor for regular ores only not moon ores.  So we’re getting shit for refining moon ores. 
---
Telling you if I was hustling my mining I was getting like 6b of realizable value from this stuff. I have a ton of ship hulls to sell yet so the cash flow is still coming in but the mining has all but stopped for me.
---
Yea, Frat got lucky this time.
---
Gf. You guys had me convinced we were gonna kill zero dreads for a while
---
I... actually know people who build them from the ground up, but those people are irregular.
---
The thing I'm saying is the problem here though is, in the age of POS you were extremely limited on how many you could build in a system, and they were very vulnerable while. Now you can run as many as you'd like in a citadel that's easily defended and won't stop constructing as soon as it's reinforced.
---
&gt;If you had a POS and that POS was killed, you lost everything in it. 
---
Which is why we didn't keep our stuff in POSes, we kept it in outposts and conquerable stations.  Where we could get that stuff back via firesale or courier contract....which ended up with something like a 15% loss.
---
Asset Safety isn't new.  It's feature parity with what was already happening in Null.
---
For individual miners, they just contract to the corp at the buyback price. You can just double-check the price and then accept.
---
For jetcan mining, the scooper can just keep a running tally of who's mined how much of which ores. A bit of bookkeeping, but a simple spreadsheet can help track &amp; tally pretty easily. When I get back to my pooter I'll send you a copy of what I've used when we've done it. 
---
You also could actually set up a citadel, limit docking access to just your corp, set up a market module &amp; limit buy orders to just that station. Basically would function like corp-only buy orders.
---
I disagree
---
Even just two shiny mods makes a huge difference. The only two I recommend for cost effectiveness are a Shadow Serpentis MWD to reduce cap penalty/use and Republic Fleet cap battery for obvious cap stability.
---
If you're going to lowsec and can afford 1.5b-2b worth of ship and avoid bubbles, they're insane though. You just need to worry about high alpha ships since it doesn't have much buffer. I enjoy flying a 450m Deimos around in null, since it can still engage most battlecruisers and even some battleships. It's also just kinda my favorite hull to fly, I love my fast brawlers.
---
Yup, found it.
---
I was expecting info for it on the login screen.

---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
&gt; Let me put it this way: if we got any wind of asset safety being nerfed, I'd push for
---
Jesus, mate. You sound like the guys who threaten to unsub accounts when CCP doesn't make you happy. You're better than that.
---
&gt;Why endure ANY risk, when you can spend effort
---
That's wrongheaded. You do undock, so you accept some level of risk. Hell even market guys who don't undock accept that there's a risk they'll get drunk one day and buy an astra for 23brazillion isk.
---
You are not safe in highsec. You are not save in lowsec. You accept a risk whenever you play this game. 
---
And here's the thing about risk and effort. If the effort cost is too high, you'll accept the loss risk. The blance of risk is individual to each player. I might accept (and have had) the loss of 75% of my stuff, where you might not want to losr a single thing. Your alliance members will differ from each other on this as well.
---
And we're talking 20%. Less than a quarter. AND you won't have that 15% ransom to pay. That's practically a wash.
---
&gt;I'd recommend installing an actual human empathy module in your skull, or deferring such intelligence tasks to a person better suited to understand such things.
---
Look, this has been reasonable until now. If you're getting hot under the collar, maybe step away from the keyboard and eat a hot pocket or something. I'm neither stupid or unempathetic and being called so by a guy who is a part of the "Beep beep, I'm a jeep" alliance is pretty crazy, don't you think?

More like a reverse system, lower ranks get out a higher percentage of their lower payout, however, doing things for the militia should raise your rank (and thus total payouts), right? Thus a new member of the militia should get up to say 50% of the LP for a specific activity paid out instantly, while a player with the highest rank would get let's say 100% more in total, but would only get 10-20% of the total paid out instantly.  
---
This would allow newer members to get a quick instant payout (helping newbro's and unfortunately leechers alike), while experienced members can go for larger payouts in the long term.
---
Mainly suggesting this because I've seen new players who were only able to afford two or three plexing ships when they started, if too large a percentage of their payout is paid out later they might not be able to sustain their losses.
---
Is PI worth it? Just made my first colony yesterday, and launched 1M of carbon compounds just to find that there are very few buyers, and I would have a net loss after paying for the launch :/ is this typical?

Give SP for ganking miners. Then we can talk.

Yeah they’ll recloak again if they get away.  Saw one dude in esoteria using my exact mining comp lose his excavators and 2 hulks in under one minute.  You could be reliably at the keyboard mining and turn to take a drink and return to the screen and the bombs are in flight.  
---
I haven’t mined a single pebble since blackout because of this.  Might start a JF service now.
---
hmm, been a while since i had a good ree...
---
I've heard this argument numerous times. Not all of null was provi or delve back when. If people didn't keep stuff in null, I wouldn't have been a party to a few carrier thefts from POS mods when someone forgot to fuel them. People did keep expensive things in POSes.
---
And beside that, it you had stuff locked in a station you either firesold it (for a bigger than 15% loss) Payed someone a large sum to get it out for you, or waited to take it back. Your items might not have been destroyed but you still had to accept risk in losing them at least for a time.
---
&gt;Blaming Asset Safety for people not fighting wars is like blaming missiles not being instant damage for no wars

What?

The actual demands of mainline alliances on individual members are on the order of "join one fleet a month".

Individual corps may be more "hardcore", but if you're joining as an alternative to renting, you're not going to join those corps.

Alright. Was just curious since I’m thinking about leaving CAS to join a null sec Corp soon.
---
So your issue isnt with supers, but the citadels. Ill agree to that. Citadels are OP. I would agree that if a citadel is reffed. Construction should pause at the least. Maybe not be cancelled as thatd be op but paused.  Citadels should also run off a shorter timer. Maybe 36 hours at the max. Like shield hit at 00:00. Armor at 12:00 and hull 24 hours after.
---
Not that all of these groups probably have organized activities (Sigs &amp; Squads in Goon terminology) that offer SRP on doctrine ships.  That's a very economical way to try a lot of things out.   Others (\*ahem\* Karmafleet \*ahem\*) even give out a number of free ratting ships to new members.
---
Quite frankly, it makes a lot of sense for new players to join these corps; it's a great way to get an easy introduction to many different activities in Null.

---
You can lose much more than that, in less than that.
---
That is one of the aspects of EvE. It is a sandbox meaning you can do pretty much anything you want as long as it does not break the EULA. 
---
It sounds like you ran into a gate camp. This is where players sit around a gate and kill anything that comes through. There are ways to get through a camp, but the mechanics take a while to explain.
---
As a brand new player, I would strongly recommend the following. 
---
\- First, understand that blowing up in EvE is going to happen. That is one to the reasons that a gold rule of EvE is 'don't undock what you can not afford to lose'. Anything you undock will blow up sooner or latter.
---
\- Second, EvE can give you some of the most rewarding and rich game play of any game on the market. Part of the reality of that depth of game play is the fact that EvE can be hard to learn and is incredible complex. Learning it by yourself is very very hard. The best way to learn in my opinion is to find a group that is friendly to new players and let them help you out.
---
\- If do decide to join a new player friendly group (do this trust me), there are several out there. My recommendation is Pandemic Horde. Google 'Join Horde EVE' and instructions should come up. If you are getting lost, send me a private message here and I will walk you through the process.
---
Don't give up! EvE is awesome.
---
Oh you have a spoolup weapon? Thats cute, enjoy my subcap DD.
---
You don't need a super umbrella to mine in null safely.
---
TBH, and please understand I mean to give no offense, but do small corps really have the means and infrastructure in place to effectively enable new players (not just new-to-null players) to participate?
---
I would think you'd be better off recruiting people with some level of experience who can fly your doctrine ships.    
---
Or are you just looking to tap the influx of nullbears so you can get some of your own?
---
In where security area were you? 
---
You were probably killed by a player camping the gate. Take the time to check your killmail, it will be useful to understand what happened. Panicking is normal when you start pvp (even if it is non consented PvP), with the experience you will get more used and be able to handle it more efficiently.
---
Member 5yrs ago when mining and being a nullsec “industrialist” wasnt a thing?
---
I'm ok with everyone teaming up to frag tapi as long as they are a cancer to eve for being blue with goons ( yeah yeah yada yada "we are not blue" i know)
---
That running 20 accounts to grind industry isn't fun.
---
For the newbros of New Eden my friend.
---
One of the best pieces of advice here. EPSYN uses these frequently and they are very strong for the cost.
---
I was in 0.4 and where can I check killmail?
---
Because WORK... And capsulers are well know for their laziness as psicopatic behavior.
---
Ok, being serious here... This event is clearly designed to force us to log in and undock for a minute or two for the next couple weeks!
---
You may have time and will to accomplish a task like the one you suggested, but enough of the player base does not, and wouldn't even bother to log into Eve to spin the ship on dock if the challenge was anything near of what you suggested!
---
The objective here is make sure a big number of players at least log in once per day to show numbers!
---
Honestly, I'm not complaining... At the end of this event we will all have some extra free skill points to add without any effort at all!
---
Yeah the best advice is doing what you’re doing here and asking for help.  Providing the zkill link would help a ton and the folks here can offer some constructive advice.
---
how can you not win with a guy called Poopandpee on your side?
---
PI can be very profitable. In Nullsec or Whs you get a way better yield out of it so its more Isk/h
---
Your problem is that you are trying to sell T0/T1 stuff which most people don't need. If you want to make more profit you should consider producing at least T2 stuff.
---
What could be a problem too is the Custom Office on the Planet. Players can anchor their own and set the tax rate. If it's a ridiculous high rate you have to find another planet to do it on or destroy it, anchor your own (and defend it against aggressors)
---
Such an insidious and dastardly scheme!
---
&gt; I was traveling to a dungeon in my uncommon gear but when I approached the edge of a map a bunch of mobs or whatever started circling around me and attacking. I was panicing didn't know what to do so I activated all my buffs and went for the portal but didn't make it. I am going back to town rn. Why did this happen?    
---
You received a sufficient amount of damage that was greater than you could tank. Your health was reduced to zero and you died.
---
So, like.. circa 2006?
---
https://zkillboard.com
---
I don't believe I said you would get that much bitumens in a single shot. I only meant that a stockpile of the shittiest ore is still worth quite a bit.
---
Could you clarify something? Are you saying 50Million m3 of COMPRESSED gneiss is worth 12 bil?
---
Getting back on track, 50M is a lot of ore, even if it's not the greatest stuff. If you can mine that casually, I am both impressed and of the opinion that losing the excav now and then isn't a huge worry. If I lose my mining fleet to bombers, I'd likely lose a higher amount of assets in terms relative to the mining potential than you losing the excavs just because I can't match your yield by a huge margin.
---
&gt; Well we have a different view of CODE
---
Don't get me wrong, CODE. are a bunch of drooling retards, I just love them because they exemplify the fact that this game allows you to be a drooling retard *to someone else* :)
---
I mean...to be fair, you kind of invited it with [stuff like this](https://i.imgur.com/iUUDQTZ.png)

You should had a notification when your ship was destroyed about it, but I think you can find it in one tab of your caracter window.

---
Oh I wasn't arguing. Not against your post at any rate. I'm just saying null should be dangerous.
---
Whats your character name in game? Will find it on Zkill for you.
---
Destiny loot mechanics.... oh dear.
---
&gt;Jesus, mate. You sound like the guys who threaten to unsub accounts when CCP doesn't make you happy. You're better than that.
---
Naw. My proposed action isn't in protest -- it's to safeguard our guys. We don't want them to lose their stuff if they're AFK when the change occurs. It's utterly dispassionate, and has no capacity to influence anyone's decision on the matter, because who the fuck cares what we think? The only reason I even brought it up was to reinforce our conviction in terms of reducing risk as much as humanly possible, not to act as some sort of brain-damaged threat.
---
Also, I'm definitely not "better than that." I'm an ardent zealot who will trample all over anyone and everyone to get my point across, even my own guys, and I'm not even smart about it. You're posting on a barely disguised pedophile warren about a video game that other nerdy habits use to justify their social standing in terms of not being it. This is the absolute bottom, and I'm a bottomfeeder. 
---
&gt;And we're talking 20%. Less than a quarter. AND you won't have that 15% ransom to pay. That's practically a wash.
---
Or, we could store our assets in NPC stations, and reduce the risk to zero. 
---
&gt;Look, this has been reasonable until now. If you're getting hot under the collar, maybe step away from the keyboard and eat a hot pocket or something. I'm neither stupid or unempathetic and being called so by a guy who is a part of the "Beep beep, I'm a jeep" alliance is pretty crazy, don't you think?
---
You've demonstrated no capacity for understanding how actual humans would react to these changes from the side of the party for whom you're proposing the change. I calls 'em as I sees 'em.
---
Low security is a bit lawless and people camp gates there and will shoot first and ask questions later.   11mil is learning money.  Can dm your zkill or post it and we can help
---
&gt; I've heard this argument numerous times. Not all of null was provi or delve back when.
---
We used these things called "gates" to travel from the stations to the systems where we were mining or ratting.  You might have heard of them.
---
Seriously, you're gonna claim things were more hardcore back then, and then claim that traveling to a different system was too hard?
---
&gt; People did keep expensive things in POSes.
---
Rarely.  Supers obviously couldn't dock so they were in POSes.  No gates meant capital travel was a bit annoying, so some would store regular caps in POSes.  There was also the occasional weird person who liked to be completely on their own.
---
But the lack of personal space in a POS meant theft was too much of a threat for mass-storage by the bulk of players.  So 99% of null members kept everything they were not flying in a conquerable station or outpost.
---
&gt; it you had stuff locked in a station you either firesold it (for a bigger than 15% loss)
---
It really didn't take that much of a price cut to sell most of it.
---
&gt; Payed someone a large sum to get it out for you
---
It turns out, the new owners have logistics wings, and the vast majority of cargo they were hauling was going from highsec to null.  So they had a lot of empty space going the other direction.  Which meant it really didn't cost all that much unless you were trying to evac your stuff the second after the station fell.
---
Wait a week or two, and it was cheap.....and hey, look what Asset Safety does!
---
&gt; What?
---
You're claiming Asset Safety does not provide enough incentive for you to go shoot structures because you can't loot player's hangars.
---
Before Asset Safety, you shot conquerable stations and outposts....which didn't let you loot player's hangars.
---
I'm sure. I meant I might have seen it in Elite without realizing the decals were dynamic before I came to EVE. Sorry about the lack of clarity.
---
So me think, why say lot word when few word do trick
---
I checked it it says I lost ~9m isk
---
At least it is for 28 days, so in the end it's still a lot

The key is to roll with it, and hopefully learn from it.
---
If you can laugh at it, you'll win Eve.  This is best done with friends.

Some of the best times I've had in Eve were exploding with a bunch of friends in a futile battle.  The losses didn't matter.  The camaraderie did.
---
Explains why a tower did as much damage as a dread! 😂

BOT accounts are also kept plexed, is that a good thing for the game? I mean it is income for CCP right?

Still in 6 days, reward or not, his training time will be shorter by 6 days at least.

Yup.

i have a low sp and high sp character on the same account. the low sp character gets 10k sp for 1 kill. the high sp character gets 25k sp for 5 kills.
---
yeah can confirm this issue. had it on two alts.
---
I thought it may have to do with the order of redeeming and using SP injector from previous daily login and then doing the Skilling Spree activity. but have tested with several alts in different orders and they seem to work.
---
Also first bugged toon was "kill 5 NPC" and second bugged was "kill 1 NPC".
---
Eve hasn't had resource wars since.... Ever.
---
I mean you can Do some drive by scrams on a phant if you want lol, enjoy that.
---
Out of curiosity, why is it that you think that people almost unanimously recommend t1f for people to get into solo PvP? Then say go lose X of them?
---
Because I would say it's because as a newbro trying to solo PvP, it's a foregone conclusion that you're just gunna lose ships for quite awhile before you actually land a kill and it might as well be cheap. The ship and fit is mostly irrelevant, as the pilot just doesn't have a clue yet.
---
Yet you seem really hung up on this player being able to get killmails right away? It's not happening bud. 
---
The only reason I even put guns on the fit is so he can learn tracking and ammo swaps.
---
Same day as the dead baby downhill? For shame.
---
I would recommend you to always bring atleast one frigate logi with you so you can attack stuff on gates in lowsec and dont lose any ships against bigger ships that you gank
---
how much sp does that character have? my low sp alt was offered 10k for 1 kill, my 2014 main was offered 25 for 5 kills.
---
i'd say liberal use of the word "think"
---
Nullsec is only sort of different now tbh. Before, I knew that if someone was in local, I should be spamming d scan.
---
Now, I will just Scan more regularly, and often times more deliberately at certain celestials.
---
Nope. You are just ignoring super important differences between paying $ for your sub and subbing with in-game money you grinded. You are oversimplifying and taking these both as "ways to pay CCP" while in actuality they are different. Let me put it this way.
---
Suppose for the sake of argument there are 2000 real people multiboxing rorquals and they have 8000 subbed accounts among them. Take a case where they pay $ for sub. Suppose they make $96.000 a month for CCP by paying $12 average per month. Further suppose that the organic harms by these players caused 8000 real pvpers with 10000 subbed accounts to leave, causing $120.000 damage to ccps bottom line. Lastly, supplies that if these rorquals were removed and other adjustments to krabbing playstyle were made Eve would gain 5000 players over time, gaining $60.000 a month.
---
In this case, if CCP removed these rorquals by making their playstyle unviable, then by losing the Rorq subs, they would lose $36.000 a month. So depending on actual numbers, there are scenarios which CCP suffers net losses by removing rorquals if these are paying $ to CCP directly.
---
Now suppose these rorquals were actually subbed via Plex. When they go, everything else being equal, Plex will reduce in price. But will it reduce so much that it will demotivate players to buy less Plex to actually cause something like $96.000 net loss per month? Very debatable. There are much bigger pressures on Plex prices such as people investing or manipulating, that it's not even guaranteed that prices will drop meaningfully. In this case these rorquals can merely cease to exist, and CCP wouldn't suffer any profit reductions. And if Plex prices actually drop, then it's still very unlikely that they will drop to the extent that the loss from that price drop will be greater than the gain from bringing players back organically. In all of these cases, you can see it's much harder to argue a plexed Rorqual account contributes to CCP bottom lines as much as those that pay $.
---
Nah, those are mostly alphas.
---
Oh man, that nervous wait from 9pm till 10pm... till 11pm..
---
Only to then play till the EU boys were getting up and realised you've fucked up and start work in 2 hours with zero sleep.
---
They dropped in price right around the time the most recent Rorquals nerfs took place. #knowyournarrative

What does the blackout mean for players? What’s the benefit or problem?
---
Praise be
---
Source code is IP, if you think that everyone who makes something should give their blueprints away because you said so or it's "nasty and nefarious" then you should really rethink your mindset.
---
It's also pretty common that publicising your source code is dangerous, it's for the security of the user in-case of potential vulnerabilities. And if you think that vulnerabilities means his system wasn't ready for a public release you're even more naive than I originally thought. Even large corporates will have bounty programs to find these vulnerabilities. Especially when you have one developer this is way too high of expectations.

holly shit I checked my killer he has already destroyed 17b isk worth of ships

Gotta build that hook, get that habit warmed up and then get people to justify calling Eve a hobby so they won't think twice about swiping a credit card for plex.  Hook, Habit and Hobby.

my main that's close to 200m sp or something retarded these days was offered 1 kill for 10k, as was literally every other character of the 15 i've logged in to so far.
---
Yeah, uh, a single PVE player is not going to make four PVP players unsubscribe. That's a 1 to 4 ratio. Those numbers aren't even barely adjacent to reality. They're so far divorced from reality that they fail to even work within the tolerances required to illustrate a point. Nevermind the fact that any given player is not a binary PVE/PVP player, and other such silliness.
---
I'm sure if we examine personas and user stories, the 20 plex'd account industrialist makes up a fraction of a fraction. I don't care what a handful of people find fun when it so greatly impacts the economy and game.

my skill queue right now is all the weapon specs to V for subcaps because i'm too lazy to figure out what i should actually be training and all this shit uses the same remap.
---
Sucks that you'd still have to kill off hundreds of Rorquals and supers to make the economy rebound. But I guess it won't get any worse.
---
Fixing the economy is a tricky subject. If CCP hard nerfs it and the current top dogs keep all their stuff then it would take literal years for anyone to catch up. And those years would be spent getting rolled by the very same top dogs repeatedly. 
---
Would be a universe where groups not aligned with said top dogs only exist because they are allowed to. Scary.
---
They dropped right around the blackout happened
---
"Spree"  Corp mates excited, make plans to do all sorts of stuff and get hyped. Reality sets in when I see the event is a daily of kill 1 enemy.    Spree of 1.
---
&gt; Rarely. Supers obviously couldn't dock so they were in POSes.
---
If I had said supers and not carriers, then you might have a point. Supers and Titans had to be built and stored in space. and yes, they were rare once but long before citadels, PL had supers and titans to blot out the sun. People were keeping expensive assets in space. Yes, they were logged out but there were guys who made a game of knowing where they were and having them watchlisted for a gank. They were glorious days.
---
and yeah, they were more hard.
---
I'm not sure what your point is about gates. Do either of us need to debate the primary method of locomotion between systems? Yes, you can and could take gates. depending on where you were, the nearest indestructible structure might be 30 gate jumps away. I remember going through the spire and not seeing an outpost for ages.
---
I think you're really underplaying how much of a discount your firesales payed. I've bought from a number of them and was getting 30% discounts or better. Sure if you weren't in a hurry that might not happen but you have lost access to the stuff ANDthe liquid asset it represents so you're affected by it.
---
&gt;So 99% of null members kept everything they were not flying in a conquerable station or outpost.
---
I really disagree. This would be the case in regions where outposts were prevalent  but not in regions where outposts were fewer and far from systems where people lived. It's been ages since it happened but IIRC people started going hard for having outposts in a lot of systems only when the sov mechanics changed and made them a defensive structure. They proliferated after that.
---
My "what?" comment was because you said "like blaming missiles not being instant damage for no wars ". It didn't make sense and looked like a mistake.
---
I don't think the analogy is all that good anyway. I don't think I even said anything about wars. I said it would further incentivize their killing, which doesn't always require a war for territory or oppression. I mentioned earlier we had guys out looking for offline POS structures specifically because it was worth killing them and taking the stuff that dropped.
---
If you're going to post you should really stick to the narrative that is test vs. frt/horde/nc/pl. Wouldn't want to make it seem like tapi wasn't the underdog.

Drifter ship line when ?
---
When a POS is reffed it pauses and offlines anything that uses CPU, so I agree with that. Cancelled would be pretty rage inducing but paused provides a reason to defend things if you have something 10h away from completion for sure.
---
And I definitely think they need to have less grind to take down, and more risk to defend. Tethers are insanely strong.
---
i hear he's not even full time

You mean like a spree? ... a skilling spree...?

appears he was afk on the gate (grid at least). would be pretty silly if he went for point and the heron rushed him xD ... but doubtful

Trying to do it on my cyno alt in a noob ship with double civilian pulse lasers
---
I fly my Deimos almost exclusively in null albeit in home space as Delve police against small gangs. I run twin-B type reppers, twin C-type EANM, ADC and an X-type hardener as well as B-type MWD, fed navy web, faction cap boost and blood scram. Paired with a mid grade asklep set it can permatank well over 2500dps and is designed to kill entire gangs of assault frigates/T3Ds/Cruisers. It’s a fucking monster.
---
They can't really change tether mechanics that well without straight out removing them
---
This is normal life in Eve. At first I didn't understand why they do that. I've been blown up in a 300m ship and they didn't even loot anything. Some people simply like to fill they killboard with numbers, that gives them status in their own micro environment. The ship you lost is pretty cheap, you will replace it in no time. It probably would have survived if fully fitted with t2 modules. Also try to avoid anything less than 0.5 security space if you care for your ship.
---
Iapetan.
---
I was sitting around 200 km away from the gate in the system. He had combat probes and warped in around 20-25km or so i think. 
---
I try to be kinda careful in terms of directly moving towards him, since he was obviously rail guns and i didn't wanna spook him by targeting him directly from the start.
---
So i moved carefully around him slowly approaching until i was in scram range. Since he was rail gun fit, at some point he simply couldn't track me anymore.
---
And beeing 200km away from the gate, he it would have taken him some time to get back to the gate.
---
it felt like an eternity to break him, especially whilst anyone coming through the gate could be his friend and there to rescue him. There was one ceptor that jumped in but warped away. In mid of the fight he logged off. I was a bit overheating from time to time, and once i hit his peak recharge, i knew i would eventually get him.
---
I don’t get what you mean Marshy. Caps are not nearly used in the way you are used to in null. Usually in a classic armor brawl there are at most 6 caps on field, 3 on both sides with both sides knowing that those caps are most likely fucked if things swing south. More personal skill with inject tanking and Inject logi is involved rather than just dropping the hammer of 200 supers mindlessly.
---
a little over a 510% increase. Not too shabby.
---
As it should be :)
---
So what Amarian corp built one? As far as I was aware the thukker tribe has the Minnie one the serpent is stole the Gallente one. The Amarr one was the emperor ship and I don’t remember the Caldari one. But wasn’t there only one of each?

Yeah mindlessly just blasting away at each other in an N+1 mindset. Sounds like a blast in tidi.
---
holy shit dude, get therapy.
---
I believe, lore wise each empire has a few in reserve for mega fights.
---
Huh? That's not the point dummy, the fact is that his proprietary app would only be more secure open source if there were actually people looking at it with good intent and contribute. So yes, unless that happens his app is more secure from nefarious (as you call it) actors currently than open sourced.
---
People are not under some kind of social contract to open source their products because you suspect false play. It's absolutely ridiculous, but you're lucky the developer is kind enough to do it anyway.
---
Now, will you contribute to his project?
---
No panic makes rorquals obsolete as mining ships if its too risky to use excavators. Which would lead to people having to use subcap mining fleets with maybe one rorq as booster/ hauler. Subcaps can be killed even under an umbrella. If they can be killed under an super umbrella, they might come to the conclusion that they might as well move into an less populated/more quiet area to mine.
---
People will spread out, smaller entitys might have a chance to recruit new players and megablobs might thin out a little.
---
&gt; Well, 50,000 SP in about 10 minutes 
---
I assumed 11k sp weighted. If it's random then the math is 28,333k sp per day average, 10k + 50k + 25k divided by 3.
---
event lasts 29 days; 29 x 28333 = 821,657 sp average 
---
That's well over double the amount I originally (erroneously calculated)
---
Which would make this event comparable to some of the best PVE activities in EVE, yielding  almost half a month of SP instead of 1/6th.
---
_______
---
So if you don't care what you're doing in eve, it can't be worse than killing red crosses and you can stack it with other PVE, it's bonus.
---
If you're ruined however, you'll just pay $5 on any sale this year and yield a similar gain.
---
This is a good thing for the economy.
---
There are definitely some that are less than clean kills though, I know of a few people that are input broadcasting to kill them. Shame.
---
Yeah, I suppose I’m being a bit naive since it’s so easy to create P0s. The customs office has a tax of 14.9%; not sure if that’s high but as always it’s nice to not have that. I’m currently looking for a system with more diverse planets and ideally no offices.

Does destroying it in a hisec system lower my security rating? Or, make concord aggressive?

They got to bring back the captain’s quarter first!!

I actually loved WH. Did some gas runs and it was awsome. Wish i could do something passively with 1 account but mining and gas there needs full attention
---
They were upwards of 900 mil before nerf. They dropped to 600-650 and now are dropping again as people retire from mining/from the game.  Demand for them is plummeting as people realize they are now a liability and rorq mining is suicide for groups outside of super umbrella.
---
I mean they are dropping because bots can't bot.
---
Beeepbooop 11010001110101011100001110

I don't know why... this is exactly what they said it would be.
---
Now do it on each character on your account.
---
&gt; If I had said supers and not carriers, then you might have a point.
---
If you had bothered reading any further, you'd have reached the point where I talked about regular capitals.
---
But hey, you need to short-circuit that 'cause otherwise we'd get to that whole "insufficient personal space" part that kinda destroys the claim that regular line members were storing everything in POSes.
---
&gt; I'm not sure what your point is about gates.
---
:facepalm:
---
You: Alliances didn't have stations/outposts in every system!!
---
Me: We took gates from the systems with stations/outposts.
---
You: I don't understand what your point is about gates.

&gt; depending on where you were, the nearest indestructible structure might be 30 gate jumps away.
---
Guess where we didn't regularly go for ratting or mining?
---
Also, we're talking about an era where you'd regularly be taking 20 gates or more to a fight, since things like titan bridges weren't a regular thing.  So taking, say, 10 gates to krab wasn't considered that big a deal....especially since you'd be chaining spawns anyway, so you'd be traveling between systems all the time while ratting.
---
&gt; This would be the case in regions where outposts were prevalent but not in regions where outposts were fewer and far from systems where people lived.
---
Storage.  Where is your vast personal storage in a POS?  'Cause the big storage arrays were corporate arrays.  You could not safely store your own stuff in that.
---
&gt; I said it would further incentivize their killing, which doesn't always require a war for territory or oppression.
---
And my point is that incentive never existed before.  So blaming Asset Safety for lack of incentive is wrong.
---
&gt; I mentioned earlier we had guys out looking for offline POS structures specifically because it was worth killing them and taking the stuff that dropped.
---
And that stuff wasn't every line member's personal hoard.  You are now asking for every line member's personal hoard instead of shooting up ECs and refineries.
---
It's a fair question!
---
For my own corp our play-style isn't newbro friendly. However there are plenty of other corps out there than can train newer players. Sure they don't have the massive infrastructure of the Big 3. At the same time, we had many years where the Big 3 weren't the automatic suggestion of what corp to join, and EVE did just fine, so did player retention.
---
It's just that we used to have more diversity in EVE, while recommending the Big 3 isn't the exclusive reason for this, it's certainly a contributing factor imo. EVE is about building communities, and having many fragmented alliances (personal opinion), rather than this massive blue doughnut we have now. How can we have conflict in EVE when everyone is automatically funneled into the Big 3, making them continuously grow?
---
Nope. This was the mass increase (no more 5 drones in wetu) and mining amount nerfs from a couple months ago
---
I found a pic of the lapetans with the normal ones beside them for comparison and it seems like they’d fit between the spires of a keep star.  About the same size as a world ark zordah 
---
I know my Erebus was like 13 or 14 km long but the size isn’t the issue with gravity it’s mass. I mean, a thimble full of matter from a neutron star would have close to the same mass as the Eiffel Tower.
---
I think the most they could do is maybe add a delay when you come out of warp to the tether, but I'm not 100% sure how to tackle it myself.
---
I once listed a couple T2 capital rigs, and fat fingered the price.  I messaged the dude who bought them.  I figured it was a long shot, but I'd send a note anyway.  Turns out he felt bad, sent me back the ISK.  We started to talk, and low and behold he's coming out to nullsec to join my friends corporation.
---
TLDR - you don't need to be honest, but you just might make a friend by treating people well.
---
I regret it now but I sold all my ships for that cruiser except a mining and a cargoship. How do I make that money back? I must be doing something wrong since it took me like a day to farm that ship
---
I actually jumping out of +5s and undocking for 10k/day with effort was a less good option for me than staying in a station in +5s and not logging in.
---
I didn't realize blackout started in April.  GG
---
TDSIN could bring Snakes or Barghests if they wanted to, when you choose a wormhole doctrine you know what every other group uses and it's down to you to make a good decision. Novac and AFK use more battleships than the other groups because they don't form as many people, an entire NV fleet of barghests + triage can fit through a hole, if TDSIN tried to do that they'd roll half the fleet out, which is why they tend to use smaller ships but more of them.
---
Oooh it's an absolute beast. Especially against anything that runs hybrid turrets.
---
I have a shiny Astarte I made for that purpose, too. I haven't had a chance to take it for a spin yet though. The both of them definitely benefit a lot from bling, without a doubt. I just find the Deimos to be quite strong even without it!
---
I've lost way more expensive ships in much more embarrassing ways, it is part of the game! After a while you will look back on that 9mil and laugh. 
---
you should join eve university there is alot they can teach you! I spent my first year of eve there - entered a n00b and left an FC!
---
&gt; That's not the point dummy, the fact is that his proprietary app would only be more secure open source if there were actually people looking at it with good intent and contribute.
---
People don't want the source code to turn it malicious or find bugs to exploit. They want to check it to make sure its not doing anything nasty and that it doesn't have gaping security holes that you find out about later when they are being exploited by others.
---
&gt;So yes, unless that happens his app is more secure from nefarious (as you call it) actors currently than open sourced.
---
The program can still be probed for vulnerabilities without access to the source code so you are just wrong here.
---
&gt;It's absolutely ridiculous, but you're lucky the developer is kind enough to do it anyway.
---
Yes i'm so blessed that OP has given me his assurances that he's doing nothing malicious and that there aren't gaping holes in the security of it. Oh wait no i'm not and you're an idiot.
---
&gt;Now, will you contribute to his project?
---
No i won't. Because there are already programs available to do this that aren't shady as fuck.
---
Those guys knew how to gun a POS.
---
libruls git out
---
They were at 500m for longer than that.
---
No really. Every bot I've reported has been banned.
---
You don't need to lose your +5s to shoot an NPC.
---
I recently did the all rigging skills
---
Yep, 15% sounds high. But you probably won't be able to find a system without a POCO. Aggressing one will make concord angry so it's pretty much not possible without a war dec (and a corp to help you). Your best bet is finding a system with low taxes and then you don't have to worry about defending a POCO
---
YOU CAN DO THIS ON ALL THREE OF YOUR CHARACTERS ON YOUR ACCOUNT SO IT IS 3 CHANCES TO GET 3 SP REWARDS.
---
Combat refitting triage was something that rewards planning and skill.
---
Now triage gameplay has lost a layer of rewarding nuance.
---
Then you are the exception, not the norm.
---
yes its true... completly... but in this garbage game, you can actually do shit solo, that is still miles more fun then mostly everything you can do solo in eve... and... a bonus, you dont need two accounts... aaand the sub prize is even lower...
---
eve dominates the multiplayer and pvp aspects of mostly if not all mmos out there, but wow is a very good solo game xD
---
Yesterday i found an account from 2012. I forgot about it, as it was on different email.
---
The counter to nullified T3Cs is bait. Like, null has been a pve focused environment so long that people have forgotten how to do this. 
---
If you know there is a hunter around, bait with a ratting or mining ship. Bait can be cheap but the T3C is probably not so you can get a nice km or some loot.
---
I mean Skills.
---
&gt;People don't want the source code to turn it malicious or find bugs to exploit.
---
Ah of course, well I'm glad I can trust you on your word, but not the developer!
---
&gt;The program can still be probed for vulnerabilities without access to the source code so you are just wrong here.
---
Yes it can, but it is obviously much more difficult to do so. I can't quite believe that actually has to be said.
---
&gt;Yes i'm so blessed that OP has given me his assurances that he's doing nothing malicious and that there aren't gaping holes in the security of it. Oh wait no i'm not and you're an idiot.
---
He's released it already.... but I'm such an idiot, of course.
---
&gt;No i won't. Because there are already programs available to do this that aren't shady as fuck.
---
I knew that, because for one you can't, and second you're a typical (just slightly more extreme) entitled enduser who thinks he actually knows anything about this at all.
---
He lacks critical information
---
There's plenty to be done solo... My fit was 60 mil.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77873614/
---
&gt; you can PVE for SP and get less sp per hour then if you just did any other activity
---
Not sure how you're calculating that but most activities are going to be a lot lower if you're basing it on ISK/hr to buy injectors.
---
I'm sure there is some sense to be made out of that word salad of a title, but I can't quite figure it out.
---
can't, the tutorials don't open in null. PI characters aren't the most... battle tested.
---
I really don't like this. It's a daily quest and we rightly reee'd about that when they tried to introduce them permanently. Daily quests make you feel like you have to log in and complete them, on all your characters, and you feel like you missed out if you don't. It makes a game feel like work and sucks away the fun.
---
I'd bet about 25% or more of those are from Ceris Victoria. That man is a beast and he's gone on overdrive since the blackout, his team got about 40 in an hour the other day.
---
No wonder Frat moved their rorqs, I would've too.
---
But if they log in and undock they *might* lose their clone somehow. Better be safe than sorry and not log in.
---
Well he combat probed me down 200 off the gate. He went for it, i didn't really rush directly, but carefully keeping traversal, until had was close enough. I cannot say for 100%, but i would think he had some gracing hits on me, so he felt he could take me down. ofc the moment i was on top of him, he never hit me again.
---
I'll probably remap for boosting skills or fighter skills before i do rigging skils.
---
Well yeah, I was just saying the size because all the ships are roughly constructed of similar composition, so we all have a good feel of how massive a ship is by its size. For example, how light a frigate is compared to a cruiser, just by flying the things. It's really a submarine simulator anyway.
---
In terms of mass, a bus weighs 2.1x10^(9) kg whereas our moon weighs around 7.3x10^(22) I think.
---
You don't PVE? Where do you get your isk from?
---
And just run one site or scan out to K space and shoot some belt rats tbh
---
When you jumped into lowsec- you got a warning that you were entering an area that you could be shot at.   You had to click OK just just to enter that area. 
---
I recommend taking in game warnings seriously ...  this isn’t WOW
---
lol it's pretty dumb you can get it like that but thanks
---
It feels daunting when you start out. Ask questions. Hit up your killer - he'll probably talk to you about it. 0.4 space is lowsec. That means there are gate guns but no police.
---
you do know that they're effectively moving staging right? that was more a case of that than anything else honestly. Before frat decided to entrench into drones all test/fire got was boz(?)
---
I tried to read this but it made me head hurt
---
You aren't doing anything wrong. You are just inexperienced. Contrary to what it might seem like the main progression system in this game isn't skill points. It's game knowledge.
---
If you are in highsec then that’s pretty normal. Find a corp to help teach you and provide better isk making options
---
i threw some isk your way, keep learning dude. don't be afraid to get killed
---
Congratulations,  you went to a ghost site. All explorers get blowed up before knowing them.  If you notice, it had a different warp to info that came up with a yellow exclamation point. That's the first giveaway it isnt normal. Once you warp there is a random timer that you do not see that when counted down, a response fleet will kill you and the cans. Also, if you fail a can, you get hit with an area of effect explosion which will kill regular explo ships. 
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ghost_Sites
---
whew boy. Watch your BP.
---
I believe I said something to the effect that I did understand gates and that taking those gates multiple constellations away was not something a lot of people wanted to do. Nobody wants to spend the first 30 minutes of playtime trying to get into system. 
---
&gt;And my point is that incentive never existed before. 
---
You literally ignored what I said a second later. Not only did that incentive exist but PL made a point of hunting and killing POS for what was inside. The scrubs like me hunted for lower hanging fruit and dusted starbases people forgot to fuel with pinatas anchored inside. I literally said all this and you just skipped right past it.
---
&gt; You are now asking for every line member's personal hoard 
---
Now we're getting to the meat. You seem like don't care if your corp or alliance loses assets but that your personal stash is 100% safe. I didn't exactly say everything should drop because I know there would be enough gnashing of teeth to empty the warehouses of replacement tooth implants. I said, and I reiterate that a RNG 20% chance of dropping would both make eve risky again and provide more incentive for killing a structure. Not 50% Not 90%, just a 20% chance and you would not have to pay the 15% ransom you do today. Your likelyhood of a devastating loss is essentially nil while the attackers get a small (remember half the loot or more is destroyed and creates an isk sink) chance of your loot dropping.
---
Are you really unwilling to share even a fraction of your stash to the worthies who defeat you? Sharing is caring, my friend. :)
---
What was the crying over moon goo about?
---
Amen
---
Praise Bob
---
Calling it an exploit only affects people thinking of doing it in future. I don't even know who the people who did it are, and it doesn't matter. This is an instant decloak of everything near a spot - well big enough to get anything combat probed coming out of warp - with zero counterplay, and essentially makes cloaks on capitals (or expensive black ops or faction battleships) obsolete.
---
This is why I light for herons
---
I wasnt actualy trying to do anything in lowsec. My gps or wathever said I need to go thru there to reach my destination. I would have spent maybe a minute there and after that I would have been safe but I took the chance...regretably
---
Caldari race, best race
---
Covered under the "unless he screws up" caveat. Thank you for your contribution.
---
I haven't had the opportunity to do it myself yet, but what I've heard from my corp-mates is that it's a by-*character*, not by-account reward. So undock all your alts, kill a few rats. It's awkward for those of us with highly specialized alts, but seems like a pretty cool experimental approach for CCP. I hope they give a talk about the lessons they learn from it at the next regional EVE meetup.
---
The go back to HS then you can be safe again.
---
goons: "hold my titans"
---
Eve panda is one I really like to use
---
I usually see active tanked ones
---
How does one even protect an excavator in the realm of blackout?
---
Ya please do come to period basis! We have this area and no one uses it. We want to provide a cheap way to get renters and disrupt the other guys charging way too much. Querious costs more to be in...goons cannot do explo or rat in our renter space, although you see 10/10 runners there at times and is fine. Its great space tucked away at the bottom left of the map....you also get to be light blue to goons
---
Would it be better in his case to use medium and/or light drones as he attacking frigats?
---
This is only the least of the killmails these guys keep racking up.
---
So I'll be that guy. Is sov warfare really that broken? NCPL didn't bother defending their space so Goons nuked it pretty quickly. TEST vs Frat is a little more even so it's a slow boil game of IHub and cyno games. 
---
Don't we want wars on equal footing to be slow burns and wars without a defender to just be structure pings?
---
I heard Goons give you a titan when joining.
---
&gt; Ah of course, well I'm glad I can trust you on your word, but not the developer!
---
Malicious actors will get in. It's not a matter of if its how long.
---
&gt;Yes it can, but it is obviously much more difficult to do so. I can't quite believe that actually has to be said.
---
The concept you are talking about here is security through obscurity. It's not even remotely secure. It's like building your house in the middle of the woods and locking it with a tied up piece of rope and thinking no one can get in. The problem is that the internet brings an effectively unlimited number of people to said forest to look for your house. And once they find it you are fucked.
---
&gt;I knew that, because for one you can't, and second you're a typical (just slightly more extreme) entitled enduser who thinks he actually knows anything about this at all.
---
I'm not a security expert. That's why i don't release anything i've made for my personal use to the public.
---
watch your game client intensively and pull drones as soon as the bombers decloak, otherwise you will lose them.
---
One of my corp-mates talked about doing a "no-market" project back in the day. Only use stuff we made ourselves or bought from NPC seeds. Even with a corp it would be very challenging. If I were you I'd think about whether I was interested in having others involved, and whether I was going to extend the pod=biomass rule to them as well.
---
If it's a C1-C3, **and** the site name has a pirate faction in it, the site is safe and has no rats. In C4-C6, the same is true, but there is **only** **one** type of site in C4-C6 space that is "safe" to hack, and that is a [ghost site.](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ghost_Sites) It will always be a data site.
---
Ghost sites are the most profitable, most dangerous site you can hack. If you fail a hack or fail to complete the hack before the hidden timer expires (it starts as soon as you initiate warp and is a random interval), the cans explode and you will take 12000 explosive damage, meaning any frigate gets popped.
---
If you find one, you need to either have great confidence in your mini-game ability or a brick tanked Stratios/T3 to survive the explosion. You need to cargo scan each of the cans to find whichever one has an ascendancy implant blueprint and always go for that can, because it can be worth literally billions in the case of a  High-grade Ascendancy Omega Blueprint Copy. 
---
Make sure you read up on ghost sites before you attempt one, or you will be filled with regret.
---
Amazing stories! I hope I can manage to kill one cruiser one day
---
You want to have a carrier... that does not have fighters...
---
Do you know what a carrier is?
---
Your idea sounds more like a combination logi + minelayer, which seems like an odd combo.
---
On that note though, an ACTUAL mine layer ship would be pretty cool. Have basic mines, and higher tier cloaked mines.
---
Thanks for the advice stomper
---
This is a good thing. Statistically you are more likely to keep playing after being victim of a player gank.
---
holy fucking shit thank you so much
---
i think most people are upset about "no SP created out of thin air" thing that CCP was always using as an justification for introducing SP trading.
---
For reference you can do the drifter in RR Nestors or Tinker Rattlesnakes (ONLY if you know what you're doing and ONLY with decent skills).
---
The one I linked is active tanked.  It has an MSE as well because the Heron has like 240 base shield HP, which means that each MASB pulse repairs basically the entire shield amount, which in turn means you have to either bleed a little armor/structure with each pulse or you have to get substantially less than your theoretical maximum tank out of the MASB.
---
I found that I was constantly getting alpha'd without added buffer, no matter how strong I made the tank in terms of EHP/s, so this was the compromise.
---
Before.....
---
Pvp is fine, when you enjoy the path to the actual fight (roam, camp, seek, warping off, getting blobbed).
---
Yeah losing 5 hours of your time per drone just is not worth it in my eyes.
---
It's true, I'd attended some pretty messed up shit if they offered free food.
---
That's one of the hard lessons EVE teaches fairly early - never fly what you can't afford to lose.  If you had to sell everything to buy that ship, that ship was too expensive.
---
When you undock, you should always do so with the mindset that you may not be coming back.  As a new player, it's wise stick to inexpensive frigates because you *will* suffer losses, and it's always better for those losses to be ships that are cheaper and more easily replaced.
---
And when you get podded you cannot reinforce immediately like you do in null.
---
Rolling the hole suffers polarization and still randomness in exit, especially in hi-class holes there's no direct link to HS, doubling the risk to find your way out, not to mention countless skirmish break out when people roll holes: the resident on the other side might want to play with you.
---
This just seems like a nullbear's write w/o actually ever living in WH.
---
It's a 1b fee upfront, but you can't use your own structures and idk about moons, however all the anoms are free for you to krab in. Goons dropped their own and set taxes for using them. That's how they make their income, off taxes, not rental fees.

The empress has 2 lapetans and isn’t the Calderon one destroyed ?

---
It's not only bots affected though.  I would argue they need to rebalance them around the new blackout meta so Rorq pilots at least have a chance at saving them from bombers.  As of now they're effectively obsolete.
---
You obviously don't mine, otherwise you would know they're so slow and their sig so big that there's no way they're dodging that bomb.  The blackout has effectively made them obsolete.
---
I think frat and testicles are still fighting somewhere
---
we clearly said "no" when they tried to introduce dailies the last time. on top of that, it's the most effortless, uninspiring way to inflate log in numbers.
---
Just try it out, if you fail, try it again. At some point someone makes a mistake. The best i got but failed, was a navy raven ratting in Delve, when the russians where still living down there.
---
I had him into hull, but i fucked it up and i cannot to this day say why, either i mismanaged and he got out of scram range or he was stabbed ... that would have been my best kill in terms size of the ship at that point. But there will be a point that i will get something like that ... :D
---
And another thing ... use every situation. Now with blackout even better. If there are probes in system in null or wormhole space ... nobody can say they are not yours ... try to convince ppl that you are the scanner ... some third party astero might go for you ;)
---
Rusrog is still there. Plenty of time for them to die with him
---
&gt; When making such claims, it's generally a good idea to not show your own ignorance.
---
&gt; Input materials on jobs running in the citadel also drop. Those are "attributed to a player". 
---
Once you click start job, those items are still gone, aren't they? It's been a while but cancelling a job used to mean you lost all of the inputs. The reason this matters in this context if those are not attributed to a player, although the job  and the output are. It's semantics but you don't actually lose the inputs; you do lose the output but that item isn't attributed to you until the job is delivered.
---
i remember the entire community, reddit AND eve forum, loudly complaining about it. both the fact that we get dailies like some trash tier f2p theme park mmo, but also that this is the most lazy and uninspiring implementation possible.
---
One of the CCP devs was in rookie chat earlier today, he said it's random, but everyone should get the same amount of SP in the end (if you don't miss days). He didnt answer my question on whether everyone should get the same on average, or if they coded so that if you do not miss a day, you get the max possible value.
---
this sucks aaaaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssss. we didn't want dailies the last time. this is so lazy and uninspiring. welcome to world of eve online: triglavian
---
I remember my first big loss in eve. I lost my blingy nightmare and my orca AT THE SAME TIME in two diff systems. It was a total of about 3 bil and I was so sad. But that didn’t stop me from playing and 2 years later I have 3 supers, a Titan, and can afford any ship I need to have fun. It gets easier with work and a good group
---
We call them surprise skill points and they are quite ethical.
---
In Malpais I believe the attraction will be access to the super umbrella.
---
People renting in those regions won't be able to have a super umbrella, and they won't be able to make their own supers either.
---
vov

Losing to TEST at what? Overwatch? Rocket League?
---
Daily login rewards are not a cancerous mobile game mechanic. Jesus that level of delusion and "no true [PC game]"/appeal to purity gatekeeping is insane. Sometimes I wonder if this game &amp; community *deserve* to die.

Just because goons like overpowered caps doesn't make them any less overpowered or any less bad for the game.

All between 8/16 to 8/20.

I, too, and a returning player from 2008-2015, and find the Bosonic weapon a mind-boggling dumb thing.  I was there when titan proliferation began, and they had to rebalance the Doomsday from AOE to a focused weapon, because a few titans were being used to wipe out entire fleets.  The first version of their focused weapons were also problematic, as they would doomsday everything off the field.  Hictors first, so that they couldn't be tackled and nothing could hold them down (my first hic loss was to a DD).  During my time, many of the dominant doctrines consistently revolved around using Capitals and/or Supers to dominate subcapital battles.  From tracking titans to slowcats carriers to ...  There was a constant balancing act by CCP to reign in the ability of capital ships to dominate every situation.  Now I just watched a single HAW dread wipe out a 30 man svipol fleet.  That's just wrong on every level (back in my day, our 15-20 inty fleets killed the occassional carrier... slowly... very slowly... but after an hour).  
---
I love nullsec blackout, and have returned to enjoy that, but the state of capitals in this game is appalling.  I wondered why Hilmar filled the executive producer role after Nordgren left.... and I hope it's to address the imbalance within the game!  Somehow I doubt it though, because he's implemented upgraded webs that reach 98/99% stopping power, which essentially eliminates the whole point of the damage application formulas.  I think CCP has simply given up on the idea of Bigger Ships introduce weakness as well as strengths.

---
Wrong
---
&gt; Yeah, uh, a single PVE player is not going to make four PVP players unsubscribe.
---
Collective effects of 8000 Rorqual accounts might imaginably make 10000 pvp accounts unsub.
---
&gt; Those numbers aren't even barely adjacent to reality. They're so far divorced from reality that they fail to even work within the tolerances required to illustrate a point. Nevermind the fact that any given player is not a binary PVE/PVP player, and other such silliness.
---
Didn't claim the numbers accurately represented reality. They were just placeholders to make the issue clear. If Rorqual PvE'ers paid $, then we would be able to talk about a net loss for CCP when they go away. When they are PLEX'ed, we can't easily talk about that. No matter how you change the numbers, that argument still holds. And ofc, you are not engaging with it at all lol.
---
You're doing straw man just for the sake of disagreeing atm. Not even engaging with the bottom line point. Which was pretty expected. I have dealt with your kind of attitude for 3 years now :)
---
Since technically Trigs and drifters are both Jovians, it's not 0 chance they decide to unite and wipe capsuleers first.
---
#Team Trig. We're about to trigger you so hard.
---
damn
---
It actually costs 1 billion isk (still a fantastic deal) and you can forward that to me when you send in your application.
---
Exactly what I think as well. I would wager the most common cause of people quitting early is feeling too timegated to get into an activity they have an interest in. These little skill point rewards are enough to let someone inject their way into flying a destroyer or getting some drones in the air, exploring, etc. without having to drop 70m (which to a new player is a huge amount of money).
---
Shitposting
---
you can set your autopilot to avoid systems below X sec status... I suggest you modify those to keep you in mid-high sec space until you've got a better understanding of piracy/ganks/Etc.  it may take you longer to get somewhere, but you won't lose the ISK.

Mining I thinkg is the easiest. Just fly a Retriever and earn like 10 millions an hour. Also you can do Factional Warfare. It can make you win 18 millions every 15 minutes (it's more complicated than that, but it's the base earning if you make only novice sites). Abyssal sites are pretty good money, but you need a lot of isk to build a ship that is safe to fly on those sites, and you need good skills.

Nope the trig hate drifters with a passion. They break the jove one mind one body rule.
---
Yep. I was specifically addressing “You can’t reasonably do this in W-space”, not the larger question of if it’s a stupid mechanic
---
Considering the low bar we set for posting this is tragic to hear.
---
Balance wise, it'd be fair to give them a small bump in speed to compensate for the need of vigilance (though of course that should've always been a thing but even then they move so slow).  The sig can stay, though.
---
true
---
Jean... hams?
---
I hear you, but if GOONS are in charge of whether GOONS own all of null, then everyone literally becomes GOONS renters, living off their good graces.  That is not an engaging and dynamic sandbox.
---
The diversity being encouraged is not going to fix the power imbalance.  The power imbalance and the inability to ever catch up is what killed the other game I was referring to and is also what will kill Eve.  
---
It's not fun playing a sandbox that is conquered.  I have no problem admitting Eve is over, GOONS won, they conquered the final boss.
---
So what's next?
---
*You clumsy pilot!*
---
Yes, but my point stands, if GOONS decides the NIP is over, so is your supercap umbrella :/
---
yeah especially since apparently you can just kill the rat that comes with the tutorial? haven't logged in yet
---
Or when you're low SP, a large skill injector gives you 500k skillpoints for about 1 billion isk.  
---
Translating the cost to 10k sp, the 2 minutes of work is worth about 20 million Isk. Kinda good value.
---
Doesn't the boost effect continue past the expiry date as long as you take the booster before it expires?
---
all my random was 10K ... wtf ... ccp you think i'm going undock for 10k?  
---
*better spend my time into the pool*
---
I've seen other people sell custom made market reports like what you suggest, but the price isn't cheap
---
Something I've been curious about with all this free shit. Does the booster affect injected SP at all? Or does it just add a set amount of % to whatever skill you're training? I'm guessing it's the latter, but I wanted to ask anyway.
---
For CCP, small changes are the most difficult to do.
---
I need few modifications for the UI to raise up my qualify of life in this game (like multiple orders cancellation), but I can wait decades before seeing them. So for now, I rely on AutoHotkey scripts to reduce the clickfest.
---
How come people aren't kicking off about these mods that you create with RNG?  
---
Are they not as bad as it seems?
---
New EVE religion incoming
---
No you just have to mine carefully. Bombs take forever to go 30k and if you aren't afk mining with your drones over at some rock in BFE you're good
---
I think you mean "scum". Caldari scum, worst scum.
---
You haven't lived until you cannot refit from hull extenders until after you repair......
---
that sounds more like a problem with caps than subs really
---
**LET ME JUST DRIFT OUT OF SPOOL RANGE**
---
totally in-character player!
---
God you're embarassing.
---
The problem is some rocks are so big your drones end up 15km+ away from you.  They're not fast enough to get back in time.
---
To be fair, it's aimed at new players, not alts.  
---
New players are running missions, ratting, and mining (with drones to kill rats).
---
How did he do that
---
Grath rage just makes me smile, that shit comes from the heart. Never heard any rage while he was in OFOC but the man sure knows how to tell a story.
---
I think you have the wrong flair
---
Well that's just not true or comparable
---
Only idiots afk mine, even before nerfs I was always watching my screen cause battleship rats will fuck excavators up quick too.  They need to be rebalanced for the blackout meta cause right now the only thing you can do to protect your excavators from a bombing run is not use them.
---
Miner the big rock with a subcap then
---
Same way you do in wormhole space. Drone nav computers, mobile depot, pay attention, and accept that you are *going* to lose some no matter what. 
---
Because, yknow. It's nullsec. There's an explicit risk in everything.
---
23 hour downtime is just about right
---
They don't need to get back. They need to get away from the detonation site.
---
I dunno about crying but Snuffed did make a change recently to take and hold valuable low sec moons and mine them instead of just extorting isk from locals for them.
---
yep, that's why i want to gobble a 6 day one on the 31st, they expire on the 1st. that way it'll be active all the way until the 5th.
---
EVE RULE No1:
---
Never fly something you cannot afford to lose.
---
it won't get your cruiser back, but it's all experience you make. You will figure alot of things out this or in a similar way, but some day, you will look down and laugh about it and you might be the one shooting someone 11km off the gate and killing him, thinking how new he might be. :)
---
Nope, as there is actually very few buyers for those. And even then, it's a massive ISK sink, since the cheaper mutaplasmids are basically useless, and you at least need faction modules to have a profitable result, if you aren't fucked by your luck.
---
You'll generally find those modules on supercapitals or AT ships, which aren't for everybody, despite everybody saying the opposite.
---
Excellent.
---
The irony of someone in possibly the dumbest group in the entire game calling people mouth breathers lmao
---
Hope they see this bro
---
I want to be on the sansha side
---
Only the character landing the killing blow gets credit.
---
I'd already tried fleeting up on non-combat alts.
---
Hell yeah, this is what I've always wanted to do
---
False
---
Sure, lets see if that trend continues after the first month to see if the change to game mechanics is responsible or if it's just the result of a change causing players to temporarily become more active.
---
No and yes
---
You might be the maddest dude on this entire board right now
---
Welcome to EVE, now go shoot them back. 
---
The first rule of this game, and something which a lot of large null blocks seem to forget, is that EVE is dangerous as *fuck*. Safety isn't guaranteed *anywhere*, and any ship you undock is, eventually, going to die. It's something that kicks a lot of people off of the game, because  I ain't gonna lie, losing expensive ships *sucks*. 
---
But on the flip side, the risk means fights are much more rewarding, and I still get shakes six years in. 
---
Now, losing a cruiser as a new player, probably making money by mining in a venture and doing low level missions? Yeah. It sucks, I've been there and done that quite a few times. Why do you die? Maybe you screwed up fighting NPCs. Maybe you picked a fight you couldn't win. Maybe you flew into an ambush. And maybe someone was feeling like a dick and suicide ganked your new ship as you were leaving the market. Dying for a reason you couldn't help ain't fun, but it happens. 
---
If you stick with it, you'll grow past that. Soon you won't be too upset about a cruiser, because losing a battlecruiser is going to make you angry instead. Then it'll be a battleship, or a T2 ship. Getting annoyed when you die is just a part of the game that happens to all of us. 
---
The trick is to not let it keep you down. Buy a bunch of super cheap PVP frigates, join a newbie friendly corp like Red Versus Blue or Brave Newbies, and get a feel for the game. You are *going* to die. A lot. But that's how we learn. 
---
Joining a corp gives you easier access to cheaper or free ships to learn with, and new activities to make money from. Soon, you'll take 20m cruiser fits out on roams where you never intend to come back. Fly 'till you die, as I like it.
---
Remember that your ships are expendable. They are arrows in your quiver, things you shoot at someone else in the hopes that you take them down in the process. Sometimes you'll get to take your arrow back and use it again, sometimes it'll snap in half when it hits their shield. 
---
A ship in a port is safe, but that's not what ships are for. 
---
And, if you do want to give some fighting a try, mail Sibire Whittney in-game. I'll send you a couple starter ships to fight with, if you want.
---
I mean if you can tether, you can dock.
---
0.4 and below means the police won't come to help you. There are guns on stargates and stations to shoot attackers, but they won't stop people from blowing you up first. 
---
Consider this one of your first lessons learned in blood. Hopefully one of many. 
---
In eve, you learn by blowing up until you can make the other guy blow up, too.
---
Odins call being dumb again I see
---
Eve has sound?
---
Thanks for the offer but u/pottage7 has me covered already lol. I cant accept any more donations
---
\^ /u/Szbeno 
---
I've seriously blown people up, sent them a chat, handed them a new ship and taken them on small fleet roams to demonstrate how to kill someone else.
---
Too late now but you can insure ships you think you might lose and make some of that money back.
---
You should put text formatting on top of your skill queue
---
this is a destruktive thread and I am sad about it
---
Fair enough my man, getting free shit is always nice, but so is hitting a milestone on your own. 
---
Fly dangerous out there.
---
No - 50m compressed is not what I mined.  50m uncompressed.  Mostly ochre then equal spod/crokite/gneiss then bistot/ark.  Toss in 20% clear icicle.  Less than 2-3% moon goo rocks.  
---
One excavators is by comparison 2 exhumers in cost.  If a bomber fleet deletes 5 excavators that’s losing the equivalent of 10 exhumers and then I’m toast.  The calculus unwinds quickly.
---
KM?
---
Pull down the excel sheet of items then do a vlookup for things with "Caldari Navy", "Thukker", etc in the name. May have to do some additional filtering, but that should be the fastest way.

---
Do you read the full board?!  Lol??
---
Thanks mayne
---
They'll come to the conclusion that they're not worth using and just not field them like before.  The only way to protect them is with a significant defensive fleet, but those only exist in the form of response fleets, people don't hang around to protect the krabs, they only defend them cause they want kills.
---
I mean if the goal is less Rorqs and supers being made and used they're doing a good job of achieving that.  Less ISK means less people taking risks cause they can't afford to lose as much.  Less krabs to gank, and guess what, krabs can be forced to PVP as easily as PVPers can be forced to krab.
---
I'm in favor of the blackout cause the effect it has on bots, but as an atk miner I would like a fair chance to save my excavators.
---
lol cause I am new and poor. It could be more resistance I guess, but more likely it'd be a drone durability. This fit lets me solo t1 and t2 sleeper combat sites while my gf mines, so I am pretty happy with it. :3

Ah I believe the context of the thread was the players owned assets in their hangars.  I see that you’re attributing the value to the WIP in the engineering and reaction facilities which I would just propose is still a fraction of the assets in player hangars that poof into safety.

Eh I don’t buy this.  I think he sits in meetings and they talk.  Maybe not based on some of the shit that’s coming out lately.

Spec V is an awful waste of time, I'm training industry stuff before that. Even if you only do a refine or a mine once a month, it's still better than spending 30 days for 2% extra DPS (and that's a perfect remap). You can probably train all the industry skills to V in the same time you'd train all sub-cap spec skills to V, and then you could get literally free ISK and implants from your alliance to perfectly refine shit if you wanted to.
---
Referring to them as "The Un-Named" is incredibly cringey, especially when you link to who it is.
---
What's a fraction of a large value? Answer: it's a large value. Shoot the 1DQ1-A Tatara and you get trillions of ISK. How much more do you think is needed?
---

It's not like they are named in the post or anything. We don't want to cause too much of an issue here now. We are "civilized" folk.
---
In all honesty, i have no idea. All i remember is bashing some of their poses now and then over 5 years ago with them feeding some random stuff here and there. Didn't seem like they were anywhere close to being a group able to survive on their own.
---
You're a moron.
---
Not sure how to even decipher the title if this post lmao
---
It sure works in favor of it LOL I have too many sp to care about this scheme to inflate their numbers. I dont even have a clue what to train anymore.
---
When I did it I would sit directly on the rock. I could easily pull them in before the bomb detonated. Is that not a common strategy?
---
your link is fucked. It has more tracking tags than actual content and won't lead anywhere.
---
Man, I have some serious wormhole fan bois following me around for downvotes.
---
This is a question portraying to the damage done by sleepers, drifters, and the triglavian's.
---
Is there lore or a explanation on how/why some of these NPC ships deal so much dmg? I was reading about sleepers and the wiki stats that some sleepers can do upwards of 1k to a 80% resist tank. This also goes with how much dmg the drifters can do. I can see how the triglavians can get high dmg as their weapons ramp up dmg as time goes on. Do the drifters use the same type of weapon as they are both Jove?
---
But with the sleepers they mainly use energy and missile weapons. Are they just artificially stronger with no reason behind it?
---
I'm about to breach 165M SP on my 7 year old account, and I still carefully remap and fill the queue to keep training skills. And I haven't even touched capital skills or refining skills. There's plenty to train if you spend roughly an hour on EVEMon to look at all the stuff you've missed. I'm going to be completing all the electronic warfare skills only in a couple months too.
---
The really difficult decisions come with deciding what to spend the free SP on. I mostly dumped it on Precursor skills so far, as those would have been way out of my remap. But with the last few free SP gifts I maxed those as well, so now I'm hanging on to it in case CCP introduces more new skills.
---
Since you are new to the game:
---
Do NOT accept any contract that is posted in local chat especially the ones in Jita, Amarr, Rens, Dodixie!
---
Scamming is absolutely legal ingame and there is a ton of players who specialize in those activities!
---
If it sounds like a good deal --&gt; scam
---
have someone not afk with a destroyer sitting next to you
---
Don't worry, their post wasn't anything special. We knew Pantsufan is a colossal moron long before that.
---
You can fit an Astero to tank the 12k explosive damage with a little bling
---
Let's be honest. That is probably the nicest thing I will hear on this entire post... lol
---
I wouldnt worry about it to much . Short timers will be short timers , and all this will do is help a tad for the ppl who will actually play the game later , and can benefit the corp when they do get that far . But over all thats a big IF .
---
Most likely. But I think the concept of this sandbox could be reborn in a more voxel based setting.
---
If you already know that going in, just delete the post you type up next time.
---
I lose braincells whenever I do it. I don't know what's more boring, mining or ganking miners.

You can "try" that's about it.

A solution: 
---
Lower drone bay size
---
Add an Excavator bay
---
Have fighter controls for them.
---
Does someone running many accounts for industry and keeping them subbed via ingame plex hurt something?
---
What if they bought star packs to start them?

I mean yes I am definitely a colossal moron.  Ohh well got to have something going for ya I guess 😉😉😉

So botters keep botting, got it.
---
Thats basically any other ‘me, my friend and our alts’ alliance you can find in god forgotten systems across new eden. Some of them exist in hisec, own an astra or two and existed since 2006, having a cumulative killboard of 50/400 through all these years.
---
Explain how he lived past his 10s then.
---
then we wind up in the same position as we were a few years back: titans being basically boring, useless for anything but a once every six months opportunity (less so with supercarriers)
---
Congrats. Gank more.
---
yeah, solo BS is not for the newbro at all, ever.  
---
Cruisers imo are a real sweet spot to learn solo pvp in, if you have the isk and sp to support it.
---
*Clearly* only Bandwidthh was involved.
---
It's fine, chill. Move out of null so it's even harder for pvpers to find content. When they can't find anything, their posts will be the ones that don't get downvoted. 
---
Until then, sorry, but you walked in and said "think you pvp npcs like is bad" so naturally they just downvoted you and claimed victory while aimlessly wandering null looking for content.
---

Are they actually fighting with high sec or is it just the trade war they were talking about?

More incentives for bots? No thanks. We don't need VNI bots to simultaneously become SP farms.
---
different times, also low skilled chars.

There's still stuff happening in the spire? We haven't seen any pings for help up in kavela.

Also how desperate must you be to post an astra kill and claim some sort of victory?

"Tempting, but I don't get out of bed for less than half a million" - Eddie (Vince Vaughn)
---
They never said no SP created out of thin air. They said they wouldn't sell SP for cash. The fact is that CCP has been giving SP out for events and long before that boosters that have you train faster.
---
I see nothing wrong with that. Getting a couple exhumer kills and maybe a little brawl with a defense fleet/gatecamp is still better than only rorqs in space that, even if you were somehow able to get enough dps to break, still have an 5min reinforcement timer with an invulnerable cyno and supers/titans dropping on you.
---
We are super desperate for any kill of theirs. they never show for fights.
---
psst, put a back slash in front of the carrot \^_^
---
Throughout the entire fight we were pretty much praising the dread for tanking as much, giving a lot of compliments last night lol
---
max 8 per ship, dropped by a specialized ship, basically works like probes do when you launch them.

Most of the posts on this subreddit are from people who openly admit to: having never played EVE, or having played X years ago and quit. 
---
While I can appreciate the theory crafting- as I'm sure some others do- Either play the game, or don't bother writing a 2 page essay on how to fix it.

I just got a vibe of old pre-rubicon abaddon with a single cap gun on it.

How do you farm them? Besides gas huffing.

Tots reasonable.  I added a section on stability to talk about the pendulum btw.

I have the same issue with "Unallocated Skillpoints Added" on one of my characters.

A little sad since it was the 25k SP one.
---
Would have been cool to run the blackout event alone to see real player feedback and data.
---
Hey - crossposting this from /r/evenewbies since that subreddit looks dead.
---
Yea, I love this.  Miners still mining but in smaller cheaper ships that scatter/die when attacked.  Rorqs still on field boosting but probably saved by PANIC and response fleet.  Sounds awsome, imo.
---

---
You spool your drool.
---
So I've been playing elite dangerous and have found the other players to be almost entirely ganking asswipes and the gameplay to boil down to a very long and boring grind. I heard Eve is free to play so, I have a few questions.
---
1) is it pay to win like many free to play games are?
---
2) is it too grindy? Do you do the same thing over and over again just to do the same tasks but in a biger ship?
---
3) is the entire playerbase out to blow up people in ships not outfitted for combat so they can feel better about their horibly tiny genitals? Is there any appreciable consequence for attacking other players?
---
100% ochre is 8 bil and change. 5 excavs are 2.5 bil. It impacts the bottom line and you don't want to lose them at a great pace but even if you lost one flight a month, you're casually mining more isk than I am and that's with ochre, a crap ore.
---
Here's the thing. You mentioned in another comment being chased by bombers in Esoteria. WHY are you only mining ochre in a rorq? Did you leave Eso for a renter ghetto?
---
Hadn't seen this posted here yet, just saw these on Sisi? They only have frigate ones saved so far.
---
I need to check that out. Good catch.
---
1.5b fit in a retriever...
---
Some people are desperate to loose ISK I guess.
---
It's almost like we left the region :thonking:
---
Interesting. Will these be from sharable links or seeded/scraped?
---
I cant imagine for even a second being upset about this. People on this sub are out of their fucking minds.
---
Technically pirates data/relic can also spawn in shattered c4 :)
---
well, to start, don't tell reddit you're going to be bringing a carrier out
---
F
---
Yeah, strange how losing makes you do that...
---
It's hard to say what to do. I personally would like to see an influx of new players. I think if there was actual  competition of resources we would see interesting interactions between groups. There would be more content around, and groups could grow and compete more easily.
---
In addition to what’s below, any of the normal methods of bomb defense work too. Denfenders, bubbles, a couple defense subcaps. That and soon there’s going to be drone HP implant sets. 
---
Not impossible, but the size of your op will determine how practical it is.
---
You get some kind of reaction from miners time to time. You can't get reaction from space rocks.
---
Yeah. I'm really not sure about how to deal with it. The only change I want for certain right now is tethering only being available on fueled citadels.
---
How do you mean? It's a new category of fits, that appears to get added to by the ISDs/community team, you can then share these fits as you would any others but everyone will have them (if they toggle the category).
---
That's not much data.
---
Where was this? what killed you?
---
There could be a billion reasons.
---
But definitely not "no reason".
---
&gt;Once you click start job, those items are still gone, aren't they?
---
 Not really.  They're being held in limbo until the job is delivered or canceled.
---
So much this.
---
The context is
---
&gt;Is the tens of trillions of ISK available for loot in Delve alone from our myriad facilities not enough?
---
There was a forum post ages ago asking for these i think. Damn I thought it was totally forgotten
---
It's unlikely you'll see anything happen - but in the chance that you do, small stuff with webs &amp; target painters. Stuff like a Huggin, Hyena, vigil fleet issue, bellicose would actually not be bad as it can deal with light tackle using rapid lights.
---
If you do see something happen, it'll likely be a dreadnought in which case your carrier isn't going to do dicks against it. Your only hope then would be to get bhaalgorns and guardians on grid.
---
Pretty sure I did one of the tutorials a few months ago in a ratting carrier in null lol. unless something changed
---
Yeah it’s a bad idea to ask this XD
---
Your best bet is to anchor it, and watch it. Should anyone try and blap it, try to kill it with sub caps first. Bring out the carrier only if needed.
---
A carrier will draw attention, if not more, than the Athanor being anchored. Asking for help and giving this much detail will cause a lot of groups to take interest. It sounds like that they’re a going to be A: anchoring Athanor, and B: a single carrier without a back up fleet. EZ kill for a lot of people. 
---
This post was probably a bad idea, unless this is a trap. Then gj?

if you're serious about fixing the mining economy, put the Rorqs back in the POS to boost :-D
---
F, don't see him mutch before but remember him from first blade runner, he looks very cool. Its so hard to say and think about this but time for "old guard" actors is going to the end :(
---
What anoms in lowsec also contain minerals for mining? I used to hit up the cloud sanctums in null after it was cleared out and am curious if lowsec has a similar anom.
---
Glad that hassle is gone now...  I lost JF 5 3 times that way.
---
Would be appropriate for them to end up back where they started in Fountain after running The Culture into the ground.
---
Or use Miner IIs. Guess which option sane people choose?
---
Insta undock/dock
---
MWD cloak trick is probably your best tank.
---
Probably both.
---
That doesn't change the fact that you wouldn't know a good doctrine choice if it clubbed you in the head
---
\*\* Bitter Vet Disclaimer \*\*
---
1. is it pay to win like many free to play games are?
---
It's "pay to advance" quicker.  Even then you can only advance so far. You can use either ingame currency or real $ to advance quicker.
---
Everything is gated by skill points, skill points allow you to fly ships, use modules and determine your stats in said ship. Skill levels cap out, so you can "max out" the stats for each ship/fitting.
---
It doesn't matter if you've played the game for 7 years, or 2 months. If you both have the same SP for the same ship, you are equal.
---
&gt;2. is it too grindy? Do you do the same thing over and over again just to do the same tasks but in a biger ship?
---
It can be grindy, but only if you let it be. Eve is primarily (in my view) a social game. The conflict between player groups, and near infinite tools you can use to participate in the conflict is where the true variation lies.
---
Ships themselves serve specific roles. Some are bigger badder versions for that role yes. However, using the biggest ship isn't always advantageous.
---
&gt;3. is the entire playerbase out to blow up people in ships not outfitted for combat so they can feel better about their horibly tiny genitals? Is there any appreciable consequence for attacking other players?
---
These people definitely exist, it does not consist the entirely player base. The majority of modules&amp;ships you buy/use in the game are created by players, so there has to be a safe enough way to do industry / trade / economy :)
---
High sec (the NPCs protect you and kill whomever is attacking you), Low sec (some NPC protection, not much), Null sec (no protection, player dependent protection), wormhole space (no protection with variable star system connections every day)
---
Some people are willing to lose their ships in order to take you out in high sec. However, they only do so on high value targets (maybe you've got a plex in your cargo hold), and there are a ton of ways to avoid them.
---
My two cents!
---
Whichever they feel comfortable using. Those of us who expect risk, know how to deal with it, and know how to accept it, will enjoy the rewards of better mining yield.
---
Duh you decloak your 20-alt destroyer fleet and fire defender missiles ASAP
---
You sure it's not Trigs &amp; Drifters just blued each other and are coming for YOU!  :-D
---
Well, it won't club us in the head if it never shows to a fight, just saying.
---
Snuffed is folding and those worthy will be considered for AVDOT afaik.
---
&gt;Nobody wants to spend the first 30 minutes of playtime trying to get into system.
---
Guess what we did back then?
---
&gt;Not only did that incentive exist but PL made a point of hunting and killing POS for what was inside
---
You are asking for drops *from every player that used that citadel*.
---
THAT incentive never existed.  Instead you had industrial POSes, some capital parking spots, and the random weird guy who ran his own POS.
---
That is an enormous distinction that you are desperately trying to not understand.
---
&gt;You seem like don't care if your corp or alliance loses assets but that your personal stash is 100% safe. 
---
Nope.  But I see it's time to deflect yet again.
---
Here's the real meat:
---
&gt;I said, and I reiterate that a RNG 20% chance of dropping would both make eve risky again
---
**EVE was never that risky.**   Ever.  Really.  I was there.  I was in null.  You know how much of my stuff was in a POS?  None.
---
You wanna know how much of my corp's stuff was in a POS?  Nothing that wasn't in-construction.
---
You wanna know how much of my alliance's stuff was in a POS?  Nothing that wasn't in-construction or a random capital.
---
Stop pretending like Asset Safety took away all your incentive.  You never got to loot line member's hangars, and demanding it now to "get back to how it was" is lying about how it was.
---
He's only got 68 kills. He's still a newbie or a new alt.
---
To you guys, heck no. You just kept dying and dying. Just the rest of panfam is a bit more than a small US alliance can handle, so we've moved on to more fun areas \\o/.
---
For about 10 minutes.
---
Yeah, it did. People were using the sites to make safes out of dscan range etc iirc.
---
Shit title, shit video, shit post content, shit attempt at getting twitch views. The only people who lose are those who watch this video.
---
They started using this image on the SSO login page as of a day or so ago too.
---
OMG! thank you so much for this! :)
---
Shit. This has been the only thing I've ever said since they first revealed how much they'd mine. They announced in the dev blogs before the changes that the rorq WOULD be a support platform and highlighted it's reps and drone support and links and compression and panic, and said mining would be icing on the cake.
---
Then we got what we got and they needed to nerf it like 3 times and it's still a problem. Lol.
---
Is it true that you get 100kSP for killing Hogger?
---
Have fun where ever you go.
---
The Amarr built 4 - one was stolen by the blood raiders, one was destroyed to prevent a cold war situation, and Kador built their own since they didn't recognize Jamyl Sarum as the rightful heir.
---
Caldari built 2, Gallente built 2 and one was stolen by the Serpentis corporation back in like 2004.
---
Minmatar built 2, one of them by the Thukker tribe as a mobile city(Leviathan) and the other was just made using gallente technology so that they could have one. 
---
IF I'm recalling all my lore correctly.
---
BTW the community.eveonline.com is no longer updated (except the in universe news). 
---
Lore things are now at https://fiction.eveonline.com/
---
You too! Always just gotta go have fun in a game like this, no point stayin around if it aint.
---
You might want to check your sodium levels there bro. Also do you sort glass?
---
Mmmmmno. 
---
Because we've been doing it for years.
---
Remember that this game is, by definition, dangerous.
---
\[MBISON YES INTENSIFIES\]
---
Newbros rejoice!
---
Oo, nice link! Got anything on how to beat the hacking stuff? Last i tried, i lost a lot of canisters. I know about the rule of 6 thing and that the entire thing is similar to minesweeper
---
No problems across four accounts
---
the power of backlog
---
Using miner II's are still better than using a subcap.  I know the anti-krabbers don't care, but there's too much risk to make excavators worth using now.  I thought it was supposed to be balanced, or does that only apply when the shoe is on the other foot?
---
The context is 
---
It's honestly like with no local now this would be a great time for wars to actually be more fun and a little less predictable but well you gotta have a set of balls to pull the triggers.
---
Or just can excavators and solve the Roqual being too good at what it does problem at the same time.
---
Ah, the olden days.. :)
---
Get your isosceles-looking ass out of here
---
This looks like it was a world of fun, keep going lads!
---
J-space lacks covert cynos and exercises ironclad control over who enters and exits.
---
Lmao. The irony.
---
It's more about the "this hardly means shit to me, why should I bother?" than "oh noes my 200m isk pod!"
---
I'm flashy red and rich. I evaluated the effort and reward and the opportunity costs and decided to stay safely docked, in +5s, and offline, while I play something else. That's all.
---
All of your arguments here are based around the incorrect assumption that perfect play from a rorq pilot should result in the inability to lose excavators. Otherwise what is the point of every post you have made in this thread?
---
Sometimes you can make no mistakes and still lose.
---
This is different from much of current Eve how?
---
Is lost on you.
---
Fun trash talk / local spam is fine.
---
Shit slinging is absolutely not and you should find another home.
---
No you don’t get trillions of isk.  You might get some of the wip materials.  Depending on what jobs are in queue.  Is that the only Tatara in all of delve doing reactions?  That system index must be atrocious!  
---
You’re deliberately overstating the significance because you know it’s something that can’t be known or really shared with the public.  It’s not going to be trillions.  There’s probably trillions in Corp and personal hangars sure.  Between rorquals and excavators and goo.  Yeah I’m sure that’s right.  
---
The context of the original comment is asset safety being a disincentive to wars or showing up to timers.  You want to cherry pick one tatara in all of new eden that will have an above average amount of wip is obnoxious and doesn’t support an argument that asset safety is fine as is.  
---
Which for the record if asset safety goes away in 0.0 the exodus of assets will be nearly to evacuation levels.
---
Null and low allow supercapital response fleets and jump gate deployments with zero fatigue. 
---
You're putting *way* too much of a spin on how this is *totally* going to kill the industrial sector. It's not. 
---
People who want to use their excavators for the extra yield and take the risk which has.alwaus been there, are going to. People who re.going to swap to T2 drones, are going to. Frankly, you shouldn't even be able to mine in a Rorqual, looking at how much that's shifted the game in the direction of capital blobs, so you know what? I kind of hope that rorqual mining drops away from excavators. 
---
People aren't just going to *stop* mining. Ships need to be replaced. The danger of losing excavator drones is a pitifully small inconvenience with a million and one ways to mitigate it no matter *where* you are.
---
There has also been some vague hints of Thukker Tribe building something big recently and doing something shady in Drone Regions.
---
Third Minmatar Iapetan with integrated Rogue Drone tech...
---
Oh if you only knew who that really is.
---
F-ck yeah!
---
Yeah if you want ;)
---
Dscan
---
Dscan a lot
---
Dscan 
---
Don't turn this into a fetish thing.
---
Why?
---
No real need to nerf panic more and doing so will have very limited effect on the economy. 
---
It was always about either increasing the risk to the Rorquals (via panic, ability to secure drones in wetu, or slower drone speeds), or decreasing the yield.   Seems the yield has been nerfed just fine be the blackout.  
---
It was always about the volume of ore that could be mined with the excavators and the meta that it fueled of Rorqual mining as the only good mining.  
---
With no one using excavators  anymore you will have the volume of ore decrease significantly and the meta shift to people either doing  low APM and low ore/hr Rorquals (not very harmful to the economy) or Rorqual/barge mix for higher profits but more effort.
---
That'd be cool as hell IMO.
---
After being in a bomber gang, sitting cloaked with 6 other bombers, all 33km off a rorqual mining with Excavators. This experience has ruined Excavator mining for me personally.  I've seen what it's like from both sides, and it's like shooting fish in a barrel without local.
---
Especially in Delve, where I know there are always people who are always hunting in my region.
---
&gt;"surely win" and would then surely enjoy a good romp around in our space because "we can not form or hold any legitimate fight".
---
If this is true you need to win eve. What kind of group won't even fight to keep their own space?.
---
In top of it all you try to post a video of some fleet being badass? Wat?!
---
You should have clown music playing in that video.
---
Well, just do what y'all always tell everyone else to do. 
---
Adapt, or die. 
---
You could buy a fleet of procurers for one excavator. Works much better.
---
Depends on the rock, the larger rocks can leave your excavator more then 10km away on the far side of the rock.
---
This one is for the little guys, that had their hard earned first fitted destroyed vaporised by drifters or cloaky lokis when they proudly first ondocked it, for whom 25k skillpoints still means something relevant.
---
How strongs are carriers versus small (5-6 man?) subcap groups? My main concern was a small roaming gang coming to poke and pause the anchoring timer. 
---
I recognize that if we get dropped then we've lost the Athanor + carrier.
---
*lose 
---
:(
---
No jump freighters lost.. your dreads all seemed to have guns. You guys are getting better
---
Kill them all. Rorquals should never have been able to mine.
---
My point was how is that section populated.
---
Like if you click a link would that be added to community wants as opposed to being your own to help you organize?
---
OR are those populated manually by some system?
---
Or are they scraped from killmails to find common fits?
---
I'm willing to bet everyone is going to get the same amount of SP, and that the order you get the challenges in is going to be random.
---
My favorite opsec policy is glasnost
---
&gt;Null and low allow supercapital response fleets and jump gate deployments with zero fatigue. 
---
So? None of that matters in terms of safeguarding excavator use. Covert cynos allow for zero-notification insertion of stealth bombers into the system. Once that occurs, it's all over -- the stealth bombers warp to an anom, decloak, shoot one volley of torps, and delete one or more excavators. Even if there are a functionally unlimited number of instalock cormorants or whatever other ship deletes stealth bombers, they cannot physically prevent the stealth bombers from succeeding.
---
In j-space, you can prevent stealth bombers from entering your system by rolling all the K162s and wandering holes and critting your static. Boom, locked down.
---
Of course people aren't going to stop mining. It's not going to "kill the industrial sector." However, they're going to mine with Miner IIs, not excavators. Rorquals still have excellent performance characteristics without excavators. What gets in my craw is this disingenuous assertion that excavator use is somehow even remotely feasible in nullsec. It's willfully ignoring basic game mechanics.
---
I personally have hundreds of billions of ISK in jobs cooking in that Tatara right now. The system index for reactions in 1DQ1-A is, in fact, the absolute highest in the game, and has been for years. If you shoot it, right now, you will get about 250b of my stuff, give or take depending on the whims of the loot fairy. And I'm small time compared to a lot of others. We have about 20 primary reactor facilities, and while none are as well-trafficked as 1DQ1-A's, they're still very respectable in their own right.
---
And that's just reactions.
---
My argument is that loot is an insufficient motivator for war. There's tens, possibly hundreds of trillions of loot available all over Eve, right now, that no one is invading for. It's a specious argument that increasing loot from Lots to Slightly More Lots will somehow spark war.
---
You don’t. 
---
The only way to protect them is to leave them in station and use T2 drones.  
---
If yuh were a real risk taker though, you could maybe use them on the smaller rocks but about the max number of Rorquals you could multibox doing that would be 4 or so and you would need to be Jonny on the spot with recalling them.
---
did someone say jump?
---
^ this
---
We have rules that you have to mine the ochre first.  Which you should know being in dreddit.  
---
So if that’s the thing I don’t understand your point?
---
Don't get me wrong, I actually appreciate your point, it's valid.
---
BUT..
---
DOESN'T that mean I have to form up and PvP my way through pirates?
---
Oh no!
---
That's somehow different from what happens now!!!
---
All sarcasm aside, what are my options?
---
Form up and fight OR  go into the most far flung systems (alone) to spin buttons?
---
I want to put the farmers on the front line at least.
---
It gives me some hope of being able to PvP all the time.
---
If that means I'm fighting pirates and their Alts, that's objectively more pvp.
---
 It means I'm going to see like-minded fleet mates headed towards that same point in space and staging out of similar locations.
---
It means that serious fleets would need to form, giving vets something to fly other than destroyers and frigs.
---
Isn't all of that an improvement over what we have now?
---
That could literally mean anything.
---
The "appearance" of random is what they are going for.
---
Whether that means true random or not is up in the air.
---
I'm down.
---
What’s evemon?
---
Isn't it more fun to have people risk a killmail lure?
---
I find the part about fighters a good point. Like this idea overall.
---
Unless they remove mining from rorquals completely, people will always use them because barges are too weak to defend themselves. Even skiffs die to 10+ bombers and 1-2 tackle. With no local, barges just die too much without the big boy protecting them and even then, barges still die. Everything ccp and hunters do at this point just pushes people further and further in big ships that can defend themselves/each other which cause more of you to bitch about it
---
I think it's questionable how much this will really work.
---
There will still be steps further away.
---
They'll still have to wait.
---
If what they really want to do is fly a carrier, these still won't make much of a dent in that.
---
You got me so excited. We've had the same theme song for two years 🙄
---
&gt; Guess which option sane people choose?
---
I'm not saying that people should choose to lose excavs, but when "sane" people only use expensive things in nullsec with near-zero risk, and you'd have to be "insane" to use expensive things with non-zero risk *even if you make a profit* we've got problems.
---
or 5!
---
The point is that they didn't want to push it to be super for PVErs.
---
PVPers can still do 5 just while out hunting.
---
Miners can do 5 while mining (bring combat drones)

Caldari scum is Guristas scum

People are really bad with FOMO.

Even when the game isn't trying to make it, people are pretty shit and believing they have to do things they don't want to do.

Doesn’t work on the large spod rocks that put your dorms 12k+ away
---
Which will absolutely not happen.  
---
CCP has zero interest in making excavators any more survivable.  
---
Really...truly...blackout was a not so subtle swipe at ISK faucets and ore production in Null.  And...mission accomplished.

EVEMon is a skill planning program, you can download it. It can interface with Eve API to pull your skill queue into the program, shows you SP/h, lets you optimize your attributes for the skills you plan to train, and it has a bunch of other useful features. EVEMon and Pyfa (EFT used to be my favourite before it died) are two mandatory PC programs if you want to optimize the living hell out of your game.
---
Found the Malediction pilot
---
Man you guys are *really* feeling attacked by the sudden change to actual danger.
---
&gt; the stealth bombers warp to an anom, decloak, shoot one volley of torps, and delete one or more excavators. 
---
you have absolutely no idea how excavator bombing works
---
Is there anywhere to find the fits you have on the simulator. Like a file i can upload into game client. If you could break them down by ships it would be amazing
---
Yes, look into making Nanite repair paste. I make \~2b/week or more from 4 toons. Would be more if i had more toons manufacturing the paste, currently only have 1 toon making it so I'm limited to how much i can make.  
---
If i made 2 more toons on my "main" account i'd have 6 toons using 36 planets in total (6 toon x 6 planets each) you only need 15 materials from start to finish, so you double up on planets with different toons to get more materials. 
---
I'm in a C3 WH with my own corps Customs Offices so it's 0% for me to import/export but 3% for others, but we don't have anyone else in the hole besides random roamers, which we pop a.s.a.p
---
Thanks for bringing a fun fight and not just blobbing supers =)
---
How will force the blocs to spread out allows smaller entities to recruit new players? If one regions is not enough to satisfy a bloc, they'll take more. Blackouts can help a smaller group farm some bots or masochistic humans, but those smaller groups will never be able to take sov since blackout did nothing to nerf the supercap hammer that's going to drop on any small group that dares to put up a TCU without bending the knee.
---
FC what do?
---
To blobs.
---
When you say "here is a fire"
---
My natural assumption is that you would be willing to put it out.
---
So, what is the superior alternative to blobs?
---
Now *that* is just defeatist and pessimistic. 
---
But whatever gets your goat at this point. We already know you loathe the blackout, and I can't be bothered to shed tears for Rorquals.
---
or the miners move back to highsec where yield is only somewhat lower but you have no chance to lose your exhumer unless you are completely AFK.
---
This isn't super relevant, but something I think maybe should have been implemented early is complexity unlocking   with the acquiring of skills. Maybe find a way to make simple versions of the base menus that become more complex as the player advances.
---
If it's a war then TEST should blap Frat's staging Keepstar already
---
I didn't mention bombs, now, did I?
---
Honestly a carrier should be able to handle a 5-6 man gang. They have great application against small stuffs. You might run into issues if it’s 5-6 faction/ t2 / bling stuff. 6 Triglavian stuff could pose a threat, especially if they’re Leshaks. 
---
Essentially if we it’s a well coordinated fleet, with logi and stuff then you’d have to watch out. But a carrier could probably take out most smaller fleets.
---
You’d have to be careful of them small group of people that might run into you telling there friends “free archon / Athanor kill here”.
---
I could be totally overestimating/underestimating the abilities of a carrier though. I’ve never flown one personally.
---
Youre welcome :)
---
How so? It's basic optimization.
---
The good news is that you had the good reflex to gate crash, meaning, going back to the gate with your prop mod on and overheated.
---
Things to consider:
---
- learn about agression timer: if you shoot someone, you cannot use a gate or dock for 60 sec. That is why you gate crash, so the one agressign you can't follow
---
- learn about overheating (giving a power boost to your  module by clickign on the green bar above it, but after some cycles, it will burn out and you won't be using it anymore)
---
Lol. Total lies man.  
---
Bombs are plenty fast to get excavators now even if you are watching.  It all depends on the size of the rock.  If your drones are on the other side of a spod or large rock, and you only have the time from uncloak and bomb launch to recall, they are dead.  
---
Even dumb people will figure this out in short order, and will switch to mining II.
---
You know the barges can just get panicked as well and deny you all kills on field right? Basically nothing is changing except that you don’t get excavator killmails anymore
---
Not really. PVPers have been operating on this paradigm for years in terms of their choice of ships.
---
It's basic risk versus reward. If you want to risk losing excavators, you get more ore. And *clearly* people are still willing to risk excavators.
---
Or, the combination of blackout and covert cynos means that even perfect play can not prevent a bomber from blapping as many excavators as they want, and there's no way to keep the bomber out of your system.
---
There's a link in the fit description redirecting to the community fitting forum https://forums.eveonline.com/c/eve-information-portal/community-fittings
---
This then says that players can submit fits, that will then be reviewed before being added.
---
If someone is using an exhumer, they are retarded as a covetor is just as good at 1/10 the cost. Also you aren’t getting any brawls out of this meta
---
Reward's not good enough for the risk. Why spend the money when you can put about half of a second rorqual with miner IIs in the field?
---
Of course, but that particular example is outside of the kind of people I’m thinking about. The resources you’d need to get into a carrier takes you outside of this extreme new pilot example. You need some dedication to be able to afford a carrier, much less fly it. I’m referring more to the people who don’t want to wait a day to pilot a cruiser, or who don’t want to wait 3 days to fit a t2 mod. A time gate a new player would very realistically run into within their first few days of playing, or at least that was my experience.
---
All of your arguments here are based around the incorrect assumption that perfect play from a Rorqual pilot should result in the inability to protect your excavators.  See how that works.  
---
I'm just saying the balance has shifted too much against excavators.  They've been balanced around having local, if the blackout is permanent they need to be adjusted accordingly.
---
I think people are confusing anti-botting with anti-krabbing.  Oh, well, woe is me with four Rorq's and a ratting super lol.  Thanks for the reply.
---
What thebfuck with the delayed action hurfing here? Didnt they leave The Spire weeks ago because bigger kids kicked their toys out of that sandbox?
---
i can see so many hull tanked fits coming our way
---
A Russian friend of mine did actually disclose to me (in all seriousness) that he had read proof of gayness being detectable by doctors and potentially curable by certain meducines and/or surgery. And according to him it is not widely practiced only due to gay influences through western governments and various powerful and very rich organisations with the goal of spreading gayness through the world.
---
Why are so many of these salty retards Chinese?
---
I love how you consistently ignore the threat of roll-ins whenever you talk about wormholes. It's almost like you're doing it on purpose for spin.
---
The feeding frenzy on drones will slow down and probably become background noise over a month or two.  
---
Mining numbers will plummet and then slightly rebound as people sort out the new meta.  
---
I will be interested to see where they level out and what the distribution will look like by region when all is said and done though.
---
Hold at the gate = Jump
---
A nerf for panic is needed because its a content killer. It makes the rorq and everything on grid invulnerable for 5 minutes and still allows them to jump in titans without the attackers even being able to try to prevent them from jumping in. Invulnerable cynos is one of the most retarded things ccp has ever done imo. 
---
Also, the value of rorquals doesnt justify an invulnerability module anymore. When rorquals got buffed one could argue the invuln timer is justified with them being 12b+ ships unable to warp. But now they are like 5b, and with people switching to t2 drones they will cost less than some ratting carriers while being able to easily tank most things that arent 100 bombers, kikis or dreads.
---
Why fly a Cambion? Why fly faction supers? Why go in against a battleship with a frigate and a prayer?
---
This is a sandbox, some people *want* the high risk. Not everyone cares solely about watching numbers go up in the most optimal way possible. Folks play for excitement, or for speed, or because they just don't give a damn. 
---
This is Eve.
---
If that's how you wanna justify it to yourself, go for it. Your opinion on the matter is irrelevant; all that matters is how change actually unfolds on the field, and it'll occur roughly as the GP asserts. Hope you like more cap ships!
---
Considering this picture is horrible and doesn’t show the proper info, I will assume you put your items in a citadel that you don’t own and one of these things happened 
---
1. The Citadel ran out of fuel
---
2. The Citadel got reinforced 
---
3. The owners banned you from using it 
---
4. The Citadel is being unanchored
---
&gt; After that nerf panic and you fixed the economy.
---
you mean cause an inflation spike from reduction of ore supply.
---
If I had money I'd gild this.
---
*ahem*
---
no, u
---
I'm also ignoring server hiccups as a force for ship and/or excavator loss. Low probability events get rounded down for the sake of conversation.
---
perfect. thanks.
---
Then those people are free to choose this risk. However, most folks? Don't want it. And while, sure, the game itself can be adjusted to force the risk upon people, it's a lot harder to get it to stick when players can elect to do otherwise.
---
Dude...*every* mechanic is designed to boost login numbers. When they added capitals to the game, that was a mechanic to boost login numbers. CCP should be incentivising people to actually *play* the game they pay for.

Yknow there's a big difference between hitting one of the most heavily entrenched sites in the game and raiding smaller citadels for cash, right?

Would need more information to know, but it matters little. If you are playing Eve, get used to getting blown up and factor that in to your decisions.

It's almost like Roll in are a chance thing and not a permanent connection that enemies can come through at any time whenever they want like gates. Kill a stealth bomber in a wormhole and you get rid of that guy for a considerable amount of time. Kill a stealth bomber in null and they can be back in 10 minutes because they just killed a 500m excavator for a 40m bomber.

You could use an emulator. Neocom 2 isn’t that processor heavy and should do fine on an emulator.
---
you're wrong. they didn't kill you for no reason. they killed you because they could.
---
They can't defend their crabs everywhere, but they still defend their sov with ansiblex and caps. So there's still no "space" for small groups. It's easier to net kills on PvE ships, but not any easier to actually take sov. This is a "buff" to "content" for NPC/low/WH, but it's a not a buff for "small sov holders".
---
If this happens, I think actual mining ships should get a buff, but require more APM to make them harder to AFK. 
---
There was a good post here about how rorqs aren't super high isk/hour, the issue is the ease of scalability, so some people just multibox em by the dozen. Although personally I've not seen as many of these as this sub implies, making the strongest mining ships require user input would help. You can't afk carrier ratting, you shouldn't be able to AFK high level mining either. 
---
The botting problem could be solved by any competent anti cheat too.
---
To add to the other comment :
---
1) you can pay to get into the biggest strongest ships from day one but it just means that more experienced players will just kill you and laugh at you. In eve, experience is the most important and valuable thing that you can't buy. Also, eve isn't a "free game". It's a subscription based game. There are what's called Alpha and Omega clone states - alpha being free to play with limitations to what ships, modules and skills you can use and Omega having no limitations. 
---
2) it all depends on what you want to do in eve. Running missions, killing NPC's will definitely be a grindfest but there are a lot of players that like running missions so it's up to you what you want and expect. For me, as a PvP focused player, there's literally no grind apart from searching for a fight which can sometimes take time.
---
3) you have to understand that eve is built around PvP and everything else (mining, industry, running npc missions), more or less revolves around it. So PvP is everywhere in the game, but that doesn't mean that you'll be killed every time you undock from a station. Plus in eve it's not that hard to get another ship and after some time you get used to loosing ships and don't care about it (unless you're going to make a mistake by getting attached to your ships).
---
When I replaced my old main with Hicksimus I never considered that people would shorten it to Hicks. So while I've never been dumb enough to be the idiot that jumps when he's told to hold I've received the full experience by responding to commands for HICs.  Being a scout for a fleet with HICs...disaster.
---
Checked kb to see who this alliance is... wall of red broken by an abandoned astra km. Grats on the killmail though.  There's a lot of these in WHs if thats your thing, have a blast.
---
Based on my past experience, this game is over.  I hope I am pleasantly surprised :D
---
why this bullshit advice has to come up everytime there is a newbro around?
---
there are tons of contracts that are really unbelievably good, most of them are mady by a mistake, for example they are missing few zeros.
---
the right advice about contracts is ALWAYS READ WHAT YOU'RE SIGNING, just like in real life.
---
That'd be amazing. I want a drifter character
---
Yeah, you're probably right.  I remember being shocked when I saw how OP they were at first, but figured might as well get on the gravy train.  I don't want another serenity so i welcome the blackout, but I feel like atk miners shouldn't be punished cause of how rampant botting was.  
---
They should go a step further and make controlling the drones like using fighter squadrons.  It would be another step in the right direction to combat the boxing issue.
---
Innovating and bold new design choice by ccp

Ah, I see you're still playing that game where unless your enemies light their MWD and click approach on your blob they're risk averse.
---
Nevermind that they navigate through delve, gate by gate, trap by trap, hazing tackle that should/could catch them - that's not real risk. The only _real_ risk is burning directly at the avatar looking to get its 100th killmark. That's what _real_ pvp is, not this risk averse "refusing to feed to my titan" _bullshit_

Nah is more fun to see a mining fleet to fight instead of 1 dude in a rorqual doing it all himself.

Don't screw their narrative, it is thin like ice on a lake during the middle of spring in Canada.

Procurers die to bombers easily as well. Or Loki’s or many other common hunting ships. They aren’t worth the risk either

Isk is like ships, only fly what you can afford. As in real life Imagine winning the lottery. You now have a large sum of money you aren't used to having at once, so it starts as needs then little treats, then luxuries, eventually if you don't know how to replace that feeling of being able to replace or buy anything you want you find you can't get the things you need. 
---
I recommend grinding the time generating the isk of a Plex first, just to know what that's like. I try to stay ahead but it's Eve and it's always a grind for more.
---
That is literally the point I am making.
---
Is this the part where I tell you to adapt or die? You won't find pity from me, krab.
---
No, the point is that perfect play can not save *any* excavators if the enemy has 2 braincells to rub together.
---
The magic of diamond rats
---
What you're telling me is that mining in general isn't worth the risk. 
---
Guess what: Things die in eve. Nullsec is risky. 
---
Shit, my first kill in null was an interceptor who tried to get my procurer and didn't feel like warping off before my drones got him. 
---
If you're too afraid of risk to undock or so anything, this really isn't the game for you.
---
You have the single largest alliance in the game. If you can't afford to throw a few barges out in a mining op, someone in your leadership fucked something up *royally*
---
Omg this is gold. :3
---
Lowsec isn't the best place for a noob without friends. 
---
More experienced players with much better ships and numbers will kill you repeatedly with no punishment. I'd recommend a newbro friendly corp, they'll show you the ropes and have your back when you get attacked.
---
pls dont
---
Apples to oranges. An actual asset verse a game item which isn’t worth shit unless you RMT and enjoyed earning. 
---
Eve isn’t a job, it’s entertainment.
---
&gt; No, the point is that perfect play can not save any excavators if the enemy has 2 braincells to rub together.
---
No one is arguing against this. What are you trying to convince me of?
---
About 1/3 to 1/4 of the rorquals I bomb pull in time even in blackout conditions. Of those who do not probably about 70% could have pulled in time with the rock size and distance had they been alert. 
---
Only the largest spod rocks create conditions where a pull might not saved the excavators if properly watched.
---
Its number 2.  And it looks like the plan is to make it a trade hub instead...
---
So i can’t stop the jobs and I can’t complete them wich means I’m stuck using 4 jobs instead of ten for my industry...
---
“10k sp?? I’d rather have nothing. I don’t need your chump change CCP. “
---
You’re like thise guys that complain about receiving silver instead of gold on your comment/post.
---
Basically all you just did was give actual PVP's an idea on where to farm.
---
You'll be able to manage the jobs when it comes out of reinforcement.
---
Or maybe it is balanced properly. If you are alert you will not lose as many or as often. If you krab in less populated areas than delve or esso the odds are excavator bombers will not find you, deploy near you, or camp you.
---
You haven't been paying attention.
---
Why do you want to move to null? Honest question.
---
I mean, you guys bitch and bitch and bitch with how “unfair” it is that people who worked hard to make a home use everything they have to kill invaders with no mercy. You bitch that we make too much money, that we don’t fight fair IN OUR OWN HOME, that we don’t use “proper” defense fleets, and that we try to remove any possible threat to our space. You bitch that we over react to everything, but just 3 years ago the entire game attacked goons and have made all the members more and more defensive in nature. We have had our shit kicked in and we do not intend to let that happen again. Until it isn’t possible or worth it, you can bet we will use the biggest and safest ships we can and will give no kills easily
---
Don't forget the 1000 dps from light drones and 150km scimitar reps!
---
Time will tell. 
---
While people have made that argument to get rid of PANIC since...well...they made PANIC, I think they got the sweet spot of unraveling the negative effects of the Rorquals on mining economy by just getting rid of excavators.  
---
While I am sure that everyone that hunts Rorquals want to make them easier to kill, that’s a different non-economic argument. 
---
The real reason for PANIC was to give people a chance to actually fight over ships that are literally anchored in space without any real defense other than a drone bay and tank.  If you take away that defense, you are pretty well saying you don’t want people to really fly then.  Well fit Rorquals are still 5-7 billion without the excavators, so absolutely not a throw away ship.  
---
In the end I expect it depends on how far CCP wants to take apart mining in Null and change the meta.  
---
If they want to completely walk back, then I guess PANIC would be as good a target as any, because it would make the ship largely irrelevant.   The reality is though, they kind of already are as a primary mining ship in all but the lowest APM game play.  Better to just give people a refund on the hull and SPs if you are going to that completely nerf the ship.  
---
Rorquals as a 5 min protector of subcap mining ships and a buff ship is still a valid use and really not a very high bar from a PvP point of view.  If they wanted to protect the sub caps, they would have to pop the PANIC right away on being engaged (not after tanking a crappy small gang fleet).  That would also make them vulnerable very quickly as well.  If chain PANICs are a problem (not really sure they would be actually) just make a debuff that a sub cap can only have one panic effect (is there one of these now...don’t know). 
---
Oh well...just my 2 cents.
---
&gt; Excavator mining in Delve is now dangerous. I am upset.
---
Imagine feeding dreads to farm karma
---
This is the worst event I can remember.
---
You can cancel the jobs and go pick up your BPO's.  Unfortunately any research or copy progress will be lost and if its a build project you are gonna lose the materials.   To cancel - look for the button on the far right of the order (the area you cut off your picture).  It will ask to confirm.    
---
Lessons learned - dont put your valuables in a player owned station unless you know the owner or own the citadel yourself.   Join an industrial corp if you are an indy person
---
The defacto nerf is far more punishing to concentrated areas where hunters have little difficulty finding targets and can commit perma campers to systems / areas. 
---
In non-umbrella regions the chances of being excav bombed are almost non-existant so in some ways it is a very nice anti umbrella mechanic.
---
All it takes is one or two guys with combat alts sitting cloaked to mess up the day on anyone harassing a mining group, they can grab tackle while the fleet support rorq with 3 ddas and his small army of exhumers and barges drop drones. Smaller alliances can also do this, but they are less likely to be able to defend the rorq from a capital drop, are going to have less miners on grid, and are less likely to always have some pvp alts ready. Not saying its a bad change, but it won't help smaller groups directly.
---
Procurers are 25m a pop. That's literally 20 procurers for a single excavator, and you're comparing the two?
---
Impossible. Some dude who doesn't play says so you can't have fun without caps so it must be true.
---
Awww, that's so nice! Meta-on-tap!
---
Honestly good for people new to the game, but it will probably become too stereotypical, promoting specific metas. 
---
It should become a proper educational tool, and it could, if there is some tie-in with other initiatives. Real fits, with real examples and simple explanations of the proper tactics, as part of a package. Mandatory text notes on all the fits would be nice. 
---
If it becomes a system of internet polls for fits, don't do it. It can be great, or it can be completely fucked, up to you CCP!
---
If CCP make the fits themselves, my sides will be in orbit! They so funny!
---
They are right on this one, typically it’s electron bombs that kill excavators
---
Sounds good, they can include it with a super/titan/fax rebalance with a buff to cyno inhibs.
---
Brilliant and about time too
---
CAS has a nullsec group in Syndicate if you haven't already got your feet wet. 
---
I would highly recommend taking advantage of it to learn the ropes before becoming another F1 monkey in a power bloc.
---
That's cute.
---
I'm already thinking of how to abuse a new thing in the game. :-/
---
Absolutely! Mov op to NPC owned station is already done. Still can’t cancel though, something about low hull structure. I’ll wait for it to come out reinforcement timer.
---
Sorry for the bad pic, I’m 200km from my computer using google Remote Desktop on my phone.

Thx for the help!

They still have them they just aren't in the agency anymore so probably very difficult to find.

It warms my cold heart to see that your corp is now starting to blow up your fellow bot-aspirants in highsec. Praise James 315!
---
and now this will be your last good brawl as all of new eden will come to your next one.
---
Looks good guys, keep up the good fight.
---
If the fits don't explain why they are fit they way they are, it doesn't do any good for helping new players learn
---
Of course not -- it's easy to determine whether or not a bombing run will succeed (are there defender-capable ships on grid? if no then go lol) and the potential damage is much higher. Not to mention, I doubt there are many (if any) people dedicating defender missile platforms to the task.
---
However, I think bombing runs are, at least in theory, possible to defend against. Maybe. 12 seconds isn't much time, but it's at least halfway plausible. Not so with torpedoes -- you have a third of the time to react and two extra steps, and that's praying that you don't choose the same bomber that someone else does. If serious defense against bombing runs became commonplace, I'd wager that torps would be more common, and that's a tactic which, while lower yield, is not possible to defend against.
---
This statement is false
---
Isk/hr is between 120 abd 150. How is that not high for an afk activity?
---
Damn that sounds fun. I’m new, but an unsettled wormhole space seems pretty perfect. I’d love to set up my own structures, aka “base”
---
industry in poses has been disabled for a long time now
---
Do you remember Horde being allowed in Tribute before it got glassed?
---
Sure, but I think it's at least marginally possible to defend against bombing runs. That it doesn't happen today isn't particularly relevant to my point. See my other comment for that rationale.
---
You mean the post or the forum?
---
So feeding excavators to PVPers is somehow different?
---
I enjoy this fight.  ˇˇ
---
no worries, good luck with everything.  Ive had it happen to me before also
---
An alpha character can't even train 1mil SP in 28 days so yeah, 1.4mil would be a lot.
---
First world video game problems. Lets fuxking sto spergibn
---
Yeah. sometimes you can get large collateral contracts that pay nice, or theres tips or rush jobs.
---
Yeah my main problem with panic is that you are able to both panic and cyno at the same time.
---
&gt; I can double check my mining ledger later and m
---
Dude settle down. You made it sound like you had shit ores available. I know the rules.I also know what else is available so the idea all you have is ochre seemed rather odd and I thought you might have moved elsewhere.
---
But you can stop cynos with inhibs just fine if they don’t light before it onlines. Why should it be easy to kill a capital without needing a real fleet to do it?
---
Always wait for a heron to get the next can.
---
if it warps to a tactical and back down or it doesn't have a prop mod it's 100% bait.
---
It will reduce the amount of idiot triple tanked ships with mixed weapons and the rest of the slots filled up with what can only described as "I selected everything in my cargo, dragged it into the fitting window and went with what got fitted"  
---
So that is one obstacle out of the way.
---
You guys still playing?
---
#DID SOMEONE SAY JUMP!?#
---
Yeah. I mean, I understand intellectually that it's dumb. But I still feel like I have to grind these pointless tasks.
---
yeah if you see more than 1 covetor in you regions thats lots these days
---
You don't even have to clear an entire anom to get the rewards, so instead of logging in grabbing SP award and logging out, people will log in, grab the SP reward, select their character shoot rats for 30 seconds and then log out.
---
I am actually pretty indifferent to ‘blackout’, but say what you will, it actually did a very nice job forcing a change in the current mining meta.  
---
I honestly wonder if CCP really, truly, understood what a negative impact it would have on mining in Null and the current Rorqual-centric mining meta.   They have been nibbling at the edges of excavators and Rorquals for a long time, but with blackout they have pretty much removed excavators from the game and made the Rorqual a very expensive and cumbersome Orca with a few good tricks.  
---
If I were CCP, This would be a good time to step back and actually see what their changes are doing to ore production and mining before messing it more.  
---
Either way...I expect people will sort things out as the new meta comes together.
---
Mexican standoff
---
" that you pay a subscription fee for! " Because Alpha's don't exist right?
---
Report them.
---
Why is it unreasonable for a person that loved playing the game but stopped because of the state of the current meta to comment about what they would think make the game overall better?
---
No more FW, lowsec  even dead-er ... hope Hilmar is smarter than removing it.
---
Well this is just patently false.
---
I remember when they were 1.5 billion. That was 2 years ago if i recall correctly.
---
It doesnt work for me. I completed the "challenge", but got no unallocated SP. Restarting the client didnt help.
---
Just because I'm making a risk/reward analysis and deciding excavator mining is to risky, doesn't mean I'm "salty".
---
It doesnt work like that. Inhibs take an entire minute to anchor, a cyno is lit in an instant. Amd with panic there is no drawback to lighting a cyno too early, a lot of rorqs even light theirs if a single frig lands on grid with them.
---
Pants.
---
You should try actually living in a wormhole some time. My money is already where my mouth is -- I'm living in kspace. I double dog dare you.

[Here is a list of the fits they in at the moment.](https://pastebin.com/F7cb2bLv)

As a fitting boffin, I see their point. But they are also garbage. For instance, this is a proper gas collector/miner (meant for w-space):
---
    [Venture, Venture - Shield MWD Proper Gas Collector]

    Inertial Stabilizers II
---
    5MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive

    Gas Cloud Harvester II

Advantages: Carries a mobile depot, probes and launcher in cargo. 3 second align time with Evasive Maneuvering V and Spaceship Command V. 2.9km/s with max skills, enough to outrun a Sabre if he doesn't have two nanos. Cost effective and capable.
---
Both are way, way, way more technologically advanced than we are.
---
When the EVE gate collapsed, *most* of the cluster was dropped into a dark age and had to re-discover things like FTL travel.
---
But not everyone was.  Some people hung on to enough resources to retain their technology, and continue to advance.  The Drifters and Triglavians didn't keep everything from the Eve gate collapse, but kept a lot more than our ancestors did.
---
In the lore, there's basically 4 "tech levels".  We're the lowest, then the Jove, then the Drifters and Triglavians, then some empires that disappeared for unknown reasons.
---
150....hhahaahhahah youre retarded. Rorquals haven’t had that yield in over a year except on r64 moons. With having to use miner 2s, it’s down to like 60 mil an hour roughly
---
Ew. I think he is hoping to get more pixels than that.
---
Hello /r/all
---
Player owned structure (POS) includes refinery and other stations right?
---
But they mine like crap and die relatively easily to a small hunting party.
---
no. pos = stick.
---
poses are gone. its just structures now.
---
Pretty much anything you undock in is at risk at all times regardless of what kind of  space you’re in. There is a famous rule in EVE which says to never undock in something you cannot afford to lose. 
---
Don’t let this deter you though, welcome to EVE.
---
Maybe...maybe not.  
---
Don’t understand people’s willingness to blow up expensive unmanned drones and to tirelessly hunt for them in inexpensive ships.  :-)
---
From a numbers point of view, you don’t need to loose too many excavators to reconsider things.  I expect 90% of Rorquals people will not bother.  Those that do, will only mine small rocks with them or hide away in underpopulated areas like you suggested.  
---
I guess then the risk/reward ratio will sort itself out over time, but I expect it will not come in favorable for excavators.
---
Fuck those guys amiright?
---
This is stunningly true.
---
Well, you also *can't* remove the BPOs if the citadel's on its structure timer.
---
&gt;   Answer: it's a large value.
---
But it is a fraction of a much larger value. If you lose your shit now and it gets mary poppinsed to lowsec, you have to pay 15%. To use your words, what's a fraction of a large value?
---
I think you already have the answer handy.
---
Would you guys stop downvoting Querns? He's not shitposting.
---
I’ve been in Init before, went on quite a few Stuka fleets, hardly ever used bombs. They are nice to have because when you need them they do insane damage, but most of the time there isn’t a chance to use them
---
&gt; But you can stop cynos with inhibs just fine if they don’t light before it onlines
---
But of course they will light it before the inhib onlines if they're going to be invulnerable for 7 minutes anyway.
---
With the amount of activity we have from cloaky killers, you would be losing barges to point it’s stops being profitable as they can just sit in the system and watch you set up again and again. So if your stuff dies, you either have to wait and hope they have left or go find a diff place to mine. And after doing this over and over again, you decide “fuck it” and just use the rorqual anyways because it takes more to kill you. Games need to be fun and not everyone has fun being a punching bag.

#TEAMTRIG, SHOW US YOUR CLADES
---
New players rarely ever get into the game with the goal to get into a Carrier... They still need the ISKs to get it and eventually replace it.
---
But it will get them faster in a Cruiser to start making ISKs faster or be more efficient in a Frig for FW.
---
I completely agree.  I don't know what CCP were thinking.  An on-grid mining boost that can call in the umbrella is good enough a role (+ compression of course).
---
&gt; there's too much risk to make excavators worth using now
---
Then the price will reduce to the point where it makes sense to use them. Which is fine.
---
Welcome to eve.
---
Carrier ratting is utterly tedious.  Mining should be more leisurely as it's intrinsically dull.  Making a mechanic terrible to use isn't a good idea.  The game is supposed to be "fun" to play (or at least interesting).  And if it can't be that, it should be low cognitive burden; something you can do semi-afk.
---
The irony is laughable.
---
I raise you the astero...no better explo ship..admittedly a lot more expensive...
---
Unassailable wealth is already a thing.
---
The moon goo and casino empires where easily able to take advantage of the rorqual changes quickly and effectivly. Whatever changes are made to the rorqual will be just as easily overcome.
---
Lmao I don't mean quite as tedious of carrier ratting. Most I've ever managed in a go is an hour, before I need to do something else so I don't go insane. 
---
I just mean it should require more input than flicking through your tabs every 45 minutes. I do agree mining should be more chill than ratting.
---
I said asset safety changes would provide more incentives, not that there aren't any.
---
I'm sure your provi corp kept everything in a station because unlike much of Null at the time, it was a really good option.
---
&gt;EVE was never that risky.
---
What? Are you actually saying that a 20% chance of losing something is that big a deal, even when offset by the removal of the asset return fee? Good God, man. what is the big deal about you losing a fraction of your stuff?
---
There's no deflection You literally said go shoot ECs and refs instead of going after personal hoards.
---
&gt; demanding it now to "get back to how it was" is lying about how it was
---
Untwist your nutsack, man.There's no reason to be an ass.
---
I'm not lying about how it was. I imagine it wasn't the same for any of us, tbh. You always had the safety of indestructible storage and I did sometimes and others lived out of a POS.
---
I'm not saying we need to get back to where we were, either. I am proposing a change, a *small* change and you're really angry about it. I get it that you don't want to lose your stuff; none of us do. But leaving highsec assumes there is some risk to your personal assets. If I am suggesting anything it's that null doesn't seem to have much in the way of risk anymore.
---
Do you get angry at the thought of paying 15% to get items returned? I'm suggesting we change how the loss is tallied and determined. I am NOT saying you should lose all of your hoard. Not even a quarter of it, in fact (on average).
---
But people doing that fail quickly, and it is easy to see what they did wrong and how to correct it. 
---
Using these fits you could bumble around with no idea what you’re doing for much longer, because you can just follow them rather than needing to understand the concepts or at least ask for help
---
&gt; but require more APM to make them harder to AFK.
---
just about any rat spawn can murder an exhumer or barge if given enough time.
---
" The botting problem could be solved by any competent anti cheat too. "
---
It seems pretty clear that after avoiding even trying to make or buy one in 16 years CCP is never going to introduce an actual anti-cheat system, they have peligro locked in his closet and seem perfectly happy with leaving it at that.
---
Nope, submit a bug report &amp; support ticket.
---
It's not particularly inspiring for me personally, but I do wonder: This is a primarily PvP game, so why not design an event where you get skill points for killing other players? 
---
Currently pretty much the only way to make ISK (and in this event, extra SP) is by doing PvE, so naturally new players will spend a lot of time grinding and end up as Krabs.
---
Why not get new players PvPing by rewarding fights with ISK and SP?
---
Wait, are they going to allow saving a depot in a fitting? Because that is honestly a very good change
---
&gt;The proper way to fix the economy is to make it so that caps and subcaps don't get built from the same pool of raw materials, or at least the bulk of a capital BOM does not come from regular in space mining.
---
so you want a completely new mining mechanic added then?
---
This is where I must shill the almighty enyo
---
Manual piloting don't matter if your high snake stiletto can go 7k/s
---
Pimp your ceptor alt
---
Nice write-up! This sounds like a blast. Props to the group you are with.
---
And?
---
Yeah it's substantially different, not that I'd expect you to know that.
---
Let me put it this way - your experience with people pvp'ing in hostile space is a) roaming to frienemy space for a quick, definitely not blue jaunt or b) trying to kill annoying kiting _elite pvp'ers_ who refuse to admit that your titan is the superior ship and brawl you _like men_
---
in other words you're an absolute melon
---
This is exactly the outcome I was hoping for. 
---
Killing excavators is the only way to hurt capital ships under a supercap umbrella. This doesn't just go for small or medium groups - I've been on 150-man bomber fleets that fail inflict significant damage on a capital formup just by the virtue of how the FAX-supercarrier interaction works. 
---
Now, using excavators is a *risk*, which carries a *reward*. You can mine in perfect safety with regular mining drones. Or, you could risk it and put out some excavators. You can be prepared - eyes on gates, watching your rorqual instead of being AFK, and that preparation is worthwhile. You can trade off some of your massive tank to fit drone navigation computers. 
---
Bombing excavators is far from a sure thing - we've had to select specific rorquals which are as far as possible from big rocks and then time the bombs so the drones are on the far side when we decloak. Rorquals which pay attention (or bots) have been able to scoop them in time, but only if they react very quickly, or have faster than average drones.
---
Was a good scrap
---
Do you even hunt rorqs? How are you going to kill the barges if the rorq panics? It invuls ALL the mining barges and exhumers within its range.
---
&gt; Unless you're multiboxing reddit
---
Don't put it past me when threads get this long and arguments splinter. I have three tabs open trying to follow threads upward. :)
---
define "somewhat lower" Because there's a massive difference between a nullsec anom belt and highsec ore.
---
whoa.
---
covetors can die to the opening volley of a rat spawn, exhumers don't.
---
Alright, I understand. PVE players are somehow obligated to feed expensive kit to hostiles, while PVP players are fine to choose not to.
---
&gt; (are there defender-capable ships on grid? if no then go lol) 
---
you have no idea how excavator bombing works. this literally doesn't factor in at all. 
---
&gt; However, I think bombing runs are, at least in theory, possible to defend against. Maybe. 12 seconds isn't much time, but it's at least halfway plausible. Not so with torpedoes 
---
Again, no one is seriously using torpedos to do anything other than finish off an excav or two from an AFK rorq or that only got hit by a few bombs. The fact that you think staying on grid for the 20 seconds or it takes to decloak, lock, apply paints, and do ~20k damage to a _single_ excavator is _safer_ than decloaking, launching bombs, and warping away suggests that you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.
---
&gt; The context of this comment thread is motivation for war, not individual cost to each person. The latter is irrelevant
---
This is reddit. The context of the OP thread was "hey guys, what's up!?" and even the post above Razothyown didn't say anything about asset safety. It didn't stop you from wading in when that mechanic was mentioned.
---
In the ever changing world of thread context, I am totally within the context of changing.
---
Rorq's income is highly dependant on type of rock you are mining. Ochre, Spod or good moon rocks, will give very much different ISK/h. 120-150M per hour is or rather was, realistic speaking, in the higher end of that spectrum.
---
T2 mining drones have 33m3 base yield with, 60s base cycle time. Excavs have 220m3 base yield with 90s base cycle. Do the math yourself.
---
Train CovOps to 4 and the bonuses on a covops frig are better than the asteros. Plus the covops frigs make out to be cheaper and, in the case of the buzzard and helios, you have plenty of midslot real-estate for scan upgrade mods or dual analyzers.
---
Granted the astero is tankier and more defensible than any covops. PvP asteros are terrifying for frigates but I find that trying to dual-purpose fit the astero makes it subpar in both explo and pvp. Best to choose one or the other imo. 
---
Not saying the astero is bad, cuz its not its great, but imo the covops frigs perform better as specialised exploration ships than the astero does.
---
The more this stuff is discussed, the more I feel like we need a couple-minute spool-up on cynos.  It's possible that requiring jump drives to spool up (instead of cool down) is better, but somehow that feels like more of a sacred cow.
---
&gt; so why not design an event where you get skill points for killing other players? 
---
I'd probably waste 2 hours of my life roaming, probably die to a gate camp, then ask my alliance members if anyone is willing to "pvp" to help me get the SP, but ultimately just use an alt.
---
They're selling SP for cash too.
---
PvP players frequently lose ships, even kiting ships, while roaming. It's just the way it is. You get unlucky, someone makes a mistake, you fall into a trap. The fact that they don't usually smash their face against your super doesn't mean they don't lose ships or are risk averse - it means they don't roam 20-30 jumps through hostile space just to feed to you because you want them to. 
---
I don't know what you expect them to do - fit up an autocannon rupture and brawl your supercarrier? Like honestly, what exactly do you think they should do? Kiting is a tried-and-true tactic in LOTS of games, and there's a rich history of people who are fucking bad complaining about those kiters that just _refuse_ to stand still and die like _men_.
---
It takes 20 seconds for a group of stealth bombers to shoot one torpedo at an excavator? Shit, I must have missed that nerf.
---
Also, who mentioned "safer?" In both vignettes I assume some of the stealth bombers are brutally murdered. Doesn't stop either of them from doing their job.
---
Forgive my ignorance, but why not just use the browser Pathfinder?
---
Lol, what the fuck does that even mean?
---
Comment thread, not OP.
---
Who said anything about that? Who even said that it was at all wrong for PVP players to choose whatever the hell doctrine they want? I sure as fuck didn't. All I said is that PVE players should and will engage in the same decision making when choosing whether to forgo use of excavators.
---
How are they doing that?
---
It's slow, very slow.
---
I get that reference
---
ur an actual brainlet
---
400 IQ response right here.
---
I know. I saw asset safety and dropped my oft proposed idea. I had the opportunity and went for it. 
---
You still haven't answered. Either way you, as a player lose a percentage of your net worth. Why the hate that the guys who win a fight (not necessarily something you store stuff in) don't get some booty?
---
HELL YEAH BROTHER CHEERS FROM REDOUBT
---
I'm not interested in your irrelevant non-sequitur.
---
&gt; PVPers have been operating on this paradigm for years in terms of their choice of ships.
---
and this meant what exactly?
---
That they've elected to use hulls and comps that eliminate common risk factors.
---
They weren't previously called the Elite Feeder Club for nothing!
---
&gt; It takes 20 seconds for a group of stealth bombers to shoot one torpedo at an excavator? Shit, I must have missed that nerf.
---
It takes about 20 seconds for a group of bombers to kill an excavator and warp off, assuming it doesn't get pulled or repped first. Again, you're clueless.
---
Unless ore prices goes up by a very significant margin, ISK per hour on Rorqs with T2 mining drones will be too low to justify using it as something other than a very specialized support ship for large sub cap mining operations. T2 drones provide a fraction of a Excav's yield.
---
Self hosting it allows you to change things in the config files to suit your needs, and you will have full control over everything.
---
_and if so doing they choose to make less overall profit then we have an issue_
---
If I make 100m/hour VNI ratting or 200m/hour carrier ratting _even taking into account when I lose ships in either case_ I should _still_ carrier rat.
---
&gt;I'm not interested in your irrelevant non-sequitur.
---
You wrote a lot of words to show me how disinterested you are.
---
That or you don't have a good answer. Sorry about that.
---
A well piloted Snake/Leshak/Machariel or equivalent can solo a Carrier with the right fits...
---
Pfft. #giveRorqualsSmartBombBonuses like Bob intended.
---
Carrier ratting was always “I’m so goddamn bored and I have nothing else to do IRL or in-game” for me. And then 4 sanctums later I preferred being bored again.
---
I mean there's a description tab for saved fits for this reason though, isn't there?
---
Super fun fight. I shot things. My 2.5 year old dread finally died on its last 2 days of insurance. Blue donuts can suck eggs, this is much more fun. 
---
Escalated. Is recruiting.
---
center the probe on the nearest celestial at 4AU. all sigs will spawn within 4 AU of a celestial, and that will usually get you to a single point in 1 scan
---
Kind of missing the point, which is to appear not only weaker than the clearly stronger choice of bhaals, but also to surprise the opponent. Makes you not only more likely to get a fight, but also to surprise your opponent and win said fight. The enemy will know exactly what to expect out of bhaals and is more likely to either avoid you or fight with what they know will win.
---
The fuck? It's one volley from a group. You bring enough to guarantee the kill in one volley. Torps go 4500 m/s; are you engaging at 60km or some shit?
---
There are no small independent sov holders.
---
Good for you.
---
I wrote eight words.
---
&gt; Ah I believe the context of the thread
---
is irrelevant. We're all just here to tell the other side of the argument they're wrong and they have the wrong context anyway. like any of us have been debating in the context of "Hey guys, what wars are going?" :)
---
Not equivalent or even remotely adjacent to excavator loss.
---
A triple DDA rorq gets a bit over 1k with ogres, put down the crack pipe
---
&gt; Provi turned up in a 40/50\~ man muninn fleet to hit the forti  
---
Actually no, we didn't. We came to 3rd party on what we thought would be a forti bash between others. Thus the non-structure bashing doctrine. - As nothing proceeded to happen, we were sitting around poking and Astra hoping people were just late or something. Poked the Forti once in the hopes it would provoke something, which it didn't.
---
Personally I have no idea who all the other groups were, or who was shooting who, but was very happy when capitals starting jumping in and my overview became very very red.
---
Was a fun fight.
---
Has anyone figured out how Sarpati pulled that off? I mean, considering [the crew requirements of regular titans](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=New_Eden_Crew_Guidelines) you'd think an Iapetan would require utterly prohibitive amounts of manpower to hijack.
---
Oh, the look on *everyone's* faces when they first see a jump drive in action...
---
Were they eight hundred letters long? In the course of this thread and just in the back and forth with me, you have written quite a bit more than 40 characters.
---
Still no answer?
---
And capsuleers are killing everyone just for the shinies, because apparently, that is everything we care for.
---
I don't have an answer for unrelated garbage, no. I'm not obligated to answer whatever noncontinuous neanderthrashing you dredge up from nowhere that has absolutely no bearing on anything that has been said. If you'd like to take it as a victory to screech idiocy at me and not have me meaningfully respond, then I grant you it freely.
---
&gt;I think
---
doubt it
---
Hey, at least I try. Most of you copy and paste the same post over and over and over, praying that repetition will alter reality.
---
Weird flex but uh, ok.
---
&gt;In j-space, you can prevent stealth bombers from entering your system by rolling all the K162s and wandering holes and critting your static. Boom, locked down.
---
Stealth bombers can and do come through critted statics. So do kikimora blobs. So do T3D blobs.
---
There's no way to prevent someone from rolling into your krab hole either. 
---
Both J space and K space farming have their ups and downs and safe spaces brought on by the game mechanics.
---
Really? That's it? Wow u/Xullister, always with your stupid shitposts, reeee ded subreddit I'm unsubbing all 50 accounts
---
Did you guys bend the knee in the end? I saw a post where you refused but surprised Goons haven't come to evict you from the SOV yet.
---
Good thing you've eliminated all other possible ingress into your hole, then. It must be a horrid labor to stick one (1) cloaked ship on your crit static to look for things coming in.
---
Getting rolled into is about as relevant to risk as the server having a conniption and booting you off.
---
You seem upset again. That's sad as much of this discussion has been thoughtful.
---
I don't consider it a victory that I made you angry. I had originally thought you might be able to articulate an argument. No, this isn't victory because there was a failure to engage meaningfully.
---
The answer is yes, btw. I hadn't realized you wouldn't come to it on your own. 15% is a similarly large absolute value. The only way I can see one bothering you more than the other is the fact someone else potentially gets your stuff. That driving you to angry passion is understandable, even if that stuff doesn't actually exist to begin with.
---
Peace, brother.
---
Yeah you either have no idea what you're talking about or youre trying your super duper elite metagame stuff to push a narrative.
---
Nevermind, its both.
---
Sure. These are words that I definitely read and are absolutely relevant to the discussion. Insert description of genuflection here.
---
Do you people ever shut up about narratives? Jesus. Get some better material, fuck.
---
Do you?
---
Dude
---
You where with gian who helped rf the fort dont give some bs about 3rd partying lel
---
Nope, I don't -- "shutting up" about it would imply that I ever did it in the first place.
---
Cool! Really like the suggestions so far!
---
I read jump, I jump
---
Querns pls
---
Dude....you where with Gian, who helped rf the fort dont go all 3rd party rubbish  lel
---
Find a post of mine that accuses someone of a narrative.
---
Does Celestial mean Star in Eve lingo?
---
stars, gates, stations, planets etc.
---
technically yes, but the nomenclature of the game defines a pos as a specific type of structure. what you're building in is refereed to as a citadel instead. While this may seem confusing, it's done specifically to avoid confusion when talking about the two different structures.
---
Er, i mean do you ever stfu with the goon narrative of the week?
---
You dont. So i say again:
---
secure.eveonline.com/dlc
---
What system? I'll come and uh... Help.
---
I heard someone say Jump.
---
To be fair to Gian, if he would have told people they were going to bash a fort there is no way people would have joined.
---
That isn't even remotely what I said, you troglodyte. I said "can you sub-sentient dumpster rejects stop crying salty sulfurous tears about some imagined, virulent infection of a narrative long enough to be beaten with a bamboo switch until you at least halfway resemble an actual human being?"
---
You don’t need blackout to kill excavators, just motivated people. A group of hunters killed 6T in Delve and Fountain in 2017-2018, half of which were excavators and local existed.
---
&gt;Seekers Investigation
---
this is patched. you only get 1500 SP instead of 200k you got a few months ago
---
The current whats?
---
Yikes.
---
&gt;implying anyone would fight a war when resources are free, infinite, and everywhere, and everyone is blued
---
it gives a perverse incentive to stop playing except to log in and complete the daily however. 
---
Just think you can struggle along with your SP + 50k or whatever for the day or you can log in for the 5mins needed to complete the required activity and then at the end of the spree be at Sp+1 million or whatever its going to be on average.  Unless your already mastered out in your area of interest you'll find things easier at the end then in the middle and thus log. 
---
Maybe I'll do something in a month or two
---
More money than brains.
---
Wanted to add some suggestions I hadn't seen yet from anyone else...don't fly ships the moment you can sit in them. Wait until you can properly fit the ship with at least a full set of T1 or meta items. I'm assuming [this fit](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78003221/) is your lossmail with these recommendations.
---
First, you have 3 railguns and 2 autocannons. The Moa is bonused for hybrids so those autocannons are just wasting fitting space and lowering your DPS. Plus they have different optimal ranges so you will never be able to do max DPS. With *very* few exceptions you will not want to mix and match weapon systems. Better to use 5 slightly weaker guns than 3 decent ones and 2 useless ones.
---
Next, don't mix tank. You have a shield booster *and* hull repairer. The hull repairer is only really used for very specific purposes (mostly bait ships). A Moa is bonused for shields so you should focus on that strength.
---
Also, don't fly ships with empty module slots, especially mids and lows, unless you are going for something very specific. If you can't utilize every module slot either add fitting modules like power auxiliaries or don't fly it at all. You should always feel like you don't have enough slots, not too many.
---
Finally, you didn't have any rigs. There are many rigs that don't require skills. Treat rigs as extra modules; many of them are extremely powerful for their cost. Training up your rigging skills fairly early is a good investment as all ships utilize them.
---
Focus on the [Magic 14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14) skills asap, particularly the fitting ones. A module will do more than any other skill to make a ship more effective.
---
The reason I point this out is because you may have managed to survive if you'd been fitted better. Maybe not...the ships on you are tough, and hit hard. But you could have had a chance. With that fit, however, your defenses were basically paper and your ability to fight back was non-existent. You were basically flying a really big frigate.
---
More importantly, that ship would have been weak for its size class in any sort of PvE stuff you wanted to do as well. A properly fit frigate could likely be more effective, and a good destroyer would both out damage and out tank it. Bigger is not always better, especially with low skills.
---
Be patient. Don't try to rush to bigger ships. I've been playing since 2005 and I regularly fly T1 frigates because they're fun, useful, and cheap. Most of my income comes from flying T2 frigates.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Thank you for being honest. If Eve is just a pvp game with poor matchmaking and long ass respawn times that are labeled as other gameplay, it's probably not for me. I'm sure some people enjoy that, but I'll pass.
---
Fucking discord zoomers. Burning you all would be too merciful.
---
I've got PROOF that you lied on the internet SEVERAL times i'll see u in TEXAS COURT
---
If I can remember the numbers from when someone last crunched them, the mass to volume ratio for super carriers and titans is roughly equivalent to cork.
---
&gt;Gian
---
Who knows what that creep does in low sec when we aren't looking.
---
A similar thing happened to me, I was in a scimitar a friend gave me traveling to some place for pvp with him then when I got out of a star gate some dudes were camping and said something about my crimes against the universe like I was a nazi and one shorted me before I could warp out
---
I don't claim to be an expert on the subject, but seeing as how, to the best of my knowledge at least, that was it's intended purpose all along... I'd consider that to be a good thing.
---
I think they first brought this up 2 years ago.
---
Totally depends on what ships are being used. But carriers are not especially strong and you might run into DPS/tracking issues fairly fast. Battleships with right setups can tank regular carriers so be wary of those. If only cruisers are being used then your comp would be tackle, webs are great. 
---
But in general, be careful of deploying caps without proper subcap support. And its honestly cheaper to let the athanor die rather than to lose a carrier. Fight with subs instead.
---
supers dont siege
---
Because it would be gamed by killing an alt and such.
---
I love this policy, and I love that you're allowed to be open about it. Preventing echo chambers is one thing that every company ought to have as a priority, and I'm glad to hear CCP's policy reflects this. Keep up the good work, and please pass on my thanks for such a wonderful game to the rest of your coworkers!
---
In Blade Runner - his character Roy Batty, Died in 2019.
---
Correction: we (provi) turned up to third party shit cos LiP siad theyd form but they didnt, so only having 20muninns and a few support we poked some structures to get some pew. Which is where gungnir/baltrom came in
---
Dang... kind of a sad thought, but probably true.
---
Carriers are fairly crappy, no matter what they current ree on this sub is atm. A 5-6 man gang in cruisers alone can shred a carrier if they bring enough ammo and know what they are doing. Hell, they could even kill a super.
---
Its unreasonable that someone would know the current state of the game if they havent played in 2-3 years???    From reading reddit?  What a joke
---
"Its ok when we're doing it and in benefits us, BUT HOW DARE THE GAME CHANGE CERTAIN ELEMENTS AGAINST MY PLAY STYLE, NERF IT NOW!!!!1111"  
---
Eve is one of the few games where the Devs Need to take the time and not listen to their player base  
---
Because when they do, years worth of changes will be made to Cavour one style over another (not accusing anyone btw, just stating a fact)
---
thats actually quite literally what it means.
---
I gave up because you’re dense as fuck and someone else stepped in.  SO EAT MY ASS
---
I didnt help rf it though?
---
&gt; So? None of that matters in terms of safeguarding excavator use.
---
LOL what?!? Yes, it has everything to do with it.
---
We were relying on LiP to turn up and pew stuff then come in as third party but they let us down and didnt end up forming so we just poked around hoping for some pew.
---
1)  It’s a subscription based game with an unlimited trial. You can pay to advance your skills to get into bigger ships but bigger ships aren’t strictly better like other games might make you believe.
---
2) It’s as grindy as you make it. If you don’t want to grind you don’t have to but maybe you can’t fly as expensive ships or you certainly won’t be paying for your sub cost with in game currency without some grinding. 
---
3) Fairly naive way to phrase this question. The entire game revolves around PvP whether you are involved in the PvP or not. It is the reason it’s profitable to get into industry unlike most other MMOs where maybe only a few super high end items or consumables are profitable to craft.
---
There are different levels of security in EVE and like somebody else described, in high sec you’re fairly unlikely to die unless you’re doing something stupid. Some people will suicide new players and cheap mining ships for no reason and yeah they are probably dicks. 
---
If you’re basically anywhere else you’re entirely fair game for PvP no matter what you’re in. I’ve come across killed tier 1 haulers in low security space, which anybody can fly in an hour if they want, that had 500 million in them before. I’ve also killed them that had absolutely nothing. I don’t gimp my PvP ships by fitting a cargo scanner so I have no idea what you have inside. Now a days too it doesn’t matter if a player was created 1 day ago, it’s probably more likely they are an alt of another player than they are a brand new player. 
---
There are ways to transport goods safely and if you choose not to then yes you’re open to un-consensual PvP. That doesn’t make those killing those ships have small dicks, it’s how the game works and what makes the entire thing work.
---
Oooooo fucking EPEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNN FUCK YEAH BABY ITS SO BIG
---
How are supercapitals supposed to save excavators? How does anything that accrues jump fatigue save excavators?
---
TIL
---
That's a funny way to express "I couldn't back up anything I said, plus I didn't even understand the basic game mechanics regarding the thing I had an emotional outburst about in the first place."
---
Got ya.
---
There was a good line that Mimic (tried to) said at Eve down Under  
---
"this may not be for you guys at your level of play, but this is made to benefit those newer to the game"
---
Im a 2004 era 4chan baby tho
---
People are going full "the sky is falling" on this, but until proven otherwise I'm just going to assume that each player has an identical deck of cards that gets shuffled differently, and we all have the same total skill point possibility, the challenges just get delivered in a different order. If it doesn't work out that way then I understand people getting upset, but can we try to maintain some sense of perspective and wait a couple days for things to shake out from the new event that just started today and we know pretty much zero information about?  
---
I'm almost willing to believe this is a social experiment from CCP to see how we react to an event like this that we haven't been given any concrete details on, but that's getting a little tinfoil hat even for me.
---
Heavily entrenched Citadels...  One citadel.  This whole thing was in the asset safety of players hangar assets context.  And pencildick there wanted to get specific about wip jobs in a tatara and flex.  So for that one guy with “trillions” in wip (so he says) that a structure bash that he couldn’t at all prepare for would yield trillions of isk.  Oh brother.  Such a turd.
---
Yep, once per 12 hours is what it looks like.
---
use a hulk
---
&gt; You bring enough to guarantee the kill in one volley
---
Anyone who is bringing enough bombers to volley excavs with torps is instead using bombs, splitting their bombers up into two groups, and killing excavs 5 at a time. You have no idea what you're fucking talking about querns.
---
That's what they do now, because no one is using defenders to safeguard against bombs. I already went over this. I'm talking about after that gets solved and becomes common practice.
---
Yeah, this sounds like the best way for them to implement it at the moment. You can even justify it in-universe by saying that technological advancement is shaking things up, just like what happens IRL.
---
Oy vey, scrubs crying again. HTFU and deal with the fact that one of them is the date until which you can redeem the item, the other is the expiry date. Misleading as it may be, the redemption widow has never said until when an item is valid. Soon enough people will be crying that the expiry date should be included in the booster icon, because it's too hard checking item info.
---
I'm an old fogie, and for a long time Blade Runner was considered the best Sci fi movie ever made.
---
so that my excure for wasting your time.
---
You're just being obtuse at this point. You're missing my central point. If people are making more _profit_ - as in revenue after costs - using excavs than other drones _why would they not keep using them?_ If you're making more money even considering your occasional losses using excavs than you are using miner II's - you should keep using excavs. I dunno how to impart that most basic of math to you querns.
---
Nah I get it I was just trying to be more accurate on ore mix and volumes.  But our system is bad truesec so the values are bottom null ore unfortunately.  
---
And I was merely trying to point out losing a 4b flight of drones and exhumers would hurt to replace.  After plexing the accounts and feeding PvP sub caps I’d just rather not.  
---
I feel like players like me making a cost benefit analysis and deciding what I want out of the game says mining probably isn’t for me.
---
They don't make more profit, though. Excavators die too often and too fast to make profit possible.
---
Matchmaking doesn't exist in eve and it doesn't have a respawn time. If your ship gets destroyed you are ejected in a pod which you can pilot back to a station but if the pod is also killed then you respawn instantly in your home station. You always get free rookie ship, with basic modules so you won't ever be without a ship. Plus in eve, different ships have different roles, so you don't have just 1 ship (apart from the very beginning). But at the beginning you'll be protected from getting killed. Also, the most times players who are not "combat fit" are the ones who are hauling expensive stuff, are clueless about how to travel through dangerous places or just are at the wrong place at the wrong time. And as I said, in eve, ships are just ammunition, they get destroyed all the time and after a month or so you'll have at least 5-10 ships for different uses. Starter missions give you a few ships and some decent money for start. Eve is about learning how to survive and thrive in this dangerous universe.
---
You’re full of shit so it doesn’t merit anything other than that
---
That's a funny way to express that I'm completely correct.
---
Take your beginner ship out to delve if you can find it with your head so deep in your ass. Look st the fleets of rorqs. They must just be sitting st that belt not doing anything. And surely the uptick in excavators destroyed couldnt have happened from people actually being out and mining could it? Gasps.
---
1) Think of the game as having an unlimited free trial. You can do a lot and play for months in that trial, but you're eventually going to run into some limitations. Early on though, it won't be an issue. 
---
On an individual basis, you are as good as your skillpoints and you can essentially buy those indirectly, so if you spent money, your ship would do more damage and tank more damage than someone who didn't pay, initially. They'd eventually catch up (and since the training is real-time, they don't really need to grind to catch up). There's no exclusive item that you can only buy with premium currency (and the premium currency itself can be bought and sold from/to other players)
---
Even then, there is solo pvp in the game, but it's far from the most common. Anywhere from small gang (3-10) and fleets (50-1000) are usually the most common. The way the game is balanced, 2 low skill (in terms of skillpoints) players fighting a high skill player will usually win if they use the same or similar ships (note that, a good pilot can often win against 2, but it usually depends on his piloting skills, not skillpoints).
---
2) As with all MMOs, there is a grind, but some of the most profitable methods of making isk (the currency) are actually easy to get to for a new player if they read a few guides (exploration and gas huffing). They're all risky, but that's a good thing. Eve is risky and every ship you own will eventually blow up. Your ship should essentially be treated like ammo. The best ships are also not always the biggest because bigger ships are usually slower and tankier, but have trouble hitting the smaller ships without support.
---
3) There are some people that do that, but it's not the majority. The game is separated in different zones with different security. In the highest security zones, there's an ingame police that's there to kill someone who attacks you. Most people won't bother starting players though (mostly because looting you wouldn't be worth it). In lower security zones, you should be prepared to be attacked at all times without repercussion, but you really don't need to go there if you don't want to (though there are often good rewards in lower security zones).
---
A lot of the game is played in lower security zones (specially one called nullsec) because it is where players can claim territory and build empires, also coming with great rewards.
---
Dude I tried putting out there the status of wars no one either wants to listen or has time for objective fact.  Frat is throwing in the towel on a trillion isk a week war and no one cares.
---
I thought I'd get Rick rolled
---
HAHAHA thats funny cuz its trueee
---
Anyway we we're 35guys and gf were had :)
---
Simple forethought and a tiny bit of planning and communication.. ie don’t be afk...
---
There'd probably be a bunch of "fuck it I'm unsubscribing" posts from PIRAT guys, if that actually happened.
---
It hurts the economy greatly dude. Main two are plex (and related commodities) prices trough the roof, and an enormous materials overflow.
---
Well shit querns considering we've been doing this for well over a year now and the belts aren't packed to the gills with dessies sporting defender launchers I doubt it's gonna change any time soon.
---
I have a better deal, for 900 million isk. I'm quitting eve so I don't mind undercutting my corpmates.
---
Thanks for the tips! I will fit my next ship acoarding to your guidlines. With the money Jesus himself provided me I can probably fully equip a destroyer or even a cruiser!
---
That's a _completely different point than the one I was making._ I didn't say that miners _should_ use excavs regardless of the loss/profit. I said _if people are choosing to make less profit to avoid loss then we have a problem._ Try reading it closely. Maybe have someone sound it out for you.
---
now that you have announced you plans on reddit, you best bet is to wait a few days and ninja drop and online and hope nothing happens, because if you try to "hold grid" in lowsec with 1 carrier and some sub caps you're going to get dropped by everything in jump range.
---
That's a sane thing to think. Obviously, nothing has changed in the interim. Something like, oh, **local being turned off.**
---
I've only logged in once during the event...
---
I'm sure I'll kick myself later because its free SP though. :/
---
P3sk joining Trigger Happy, you heard it here first!
---
after the application nerfs, most sub gangs will not have a lot of issues with a carrier.
---
Ahh I haven't spoken this tongue in a while. "Jump = yes, jump twice = no, jump many times = go away."
---
No, it's not. In order for that decision to take place, it has to be at least marginally possible. It's not.
---
Hmmm, now I need to fit something designed to kill the masses of combat Herons that will be swarming around after reading this post.
---
&gt; If you stop and think... living in WH is actually easier...
---
Shhhh...  Don't say that too loudly.  Wormholers are the elite of the elite.
---
They should just do it like tags for sec status. Used to be once your sec status dropped too low to hang out in highsec, you basically just weren't ever going to highsec again because the grind to get it back was just a ridiculous ordeal that only a committed PVE'er could reasonably pull off. They fixed that with security tags. They could easily do the same for faction standings.
---
No - you know what - AGAIN - I actually went all the way back and the original comment thread was all about a purple Loki in a player hanger (not wip goods) and you wanted to switch it up to fit your argument.  His and my arguments are that asset safety disincentiveizes players showing up for structure timers and disincentiveizes fighting over space.  All your shit (Cept for all that moon goo in your huge epeen reactions wip god damn fucking huge epeen dude holy shit trillions man... TRILLIONS) goes to asset safety and you get it back less 15%.  
---
Why show up?  Why bother?  My purple Loki’s with cat ear skins drop to a ferra Russian who musters the courage to invade esoteria is gonna be safety deposited in domain.
---
Abyssal traces are like candies for hunters. It's not worth the risk unless you have a pretty fast support fleet. Also, downvoting a comment just because you don't agree with it, is being a moron.
---
That’s a strange way for admitting he’s right
---
Garbage.
---
It's just a different way of look at it.
---
If the game is built around pvp, and people sometimes spend hours looking for a fight, and you have to grind to get another ship, then  (unless the grind and looking for fights is *really* compelling gameplay) I'd rather just have a team deathmatch setup where the rest of the game that isn't combat is replaced with a 5 second respawn timer.
---
I can agree to that
---
Trash idiocy can't be right or wrong. It's just dumpster water.
---
Yes, that is what the things I was replying to are.
---
Is there some universal guide on learning to solo hunt in NS? Or an agreed upon ships/fits to learn with? I want to hunt ratters and explorers.
---
lmao did you drink too much glue there, you soy boy beta cuck?
---
Idk you’re the water used to put out a dumpster fire in almost every thread on /r/eve yet I find you wrong on almost everything I see.
---
3rd grade recess nice.
---
The point is that loot doesn't actually drive war. There's shitloads of loot to be had already, yet it doesn't drive war. Adding more loot doesn't make it better.
---
I do appreciate you calling posting that isn't mine a dumpster fire, and me the presence that quells it with its natural superiority.
---
Titan Bridge to = Titan Jump to
---
Just matching the level of discourse.
---
I didnt downvote you, maybe youre an unpleasant person?
---
Originally sure, but after the rework no. Imo it should be but right now its being forced rather than CCP just removing excavs from the game. Which they really just should have done before no local if they didnt like them. But I belive this was unintented, CCP just didnt realise that having no counters for a thing might result in problems.
---
How much time are you spending on PI per day?
---
They don’t want other groups to have a chance to catch up
---
Yeah, it's a little different in elite dangerous. You get *zero* reward for killing other players, and any aspect you may like about killing other players is more fleshed out in other parts of the game, so the only reasonable conclusion to make about killers in elite dangerous is that they do it because they enjoy making someone else have a bad time.
---
I could see how Eve could be either better or worse than elite in this respect. Either way the grind seems way worse than elite, so I'll take a pass on this one.
---
That's me today - stayed up last night getting drunk and flying about with a mate. And then suddenly it was 3:30am and it was at that point I knew I fucked up.
---
I agree with all of this, except question the suggestion to join Pandemic Horde. From what I understand they are a legit serious business sovereignty holding alliance. Maybe not the best home for a completely new player. I'd join Eve University. Their whole thing is being a starter corporation for new players. They also take care to stay politically neutral. That could be very important for the OP since time in E-UNI shouldn't count against them no matter where they decide to go after.
---
Police Girl has been cleaning up the belts
---
Your wife sounds awesome, she single?
---
Yeah i am on the fence a bit, i sorta want them to do something, i think they want to try and speed up the initial gameplay for people but finding solutions that don't get exploited for people making lots of alts is difficult.
---
It's a niche game, some people hate it, some love it and have been playing it for more than 10 years. I really suggest you try it, if you don't like it, no harm no foul, but maybe it will be a game that you'll enjoy.
---
Are you completely motherfucking dense in every single post you shit up?
---
I hope there is a burn ward in Reykjavik...
---
At this point you have to be frantically searching for every post I make and replying to it blindly.

Advice for the Philosophy of Ship Fitting:
---
1. Enhance your strengths. 
---
2. Don't cover your weaknesses (except for resistances in tank). 
---
3. Avoid getting into situations where your weaknesses will matter.  
---
4. Empty slots is wasted potential! 
---
5. Put one amusing item in your cargo hold to entertain people looking at your Lossmail.
---
6. Don't undock the ship unless you can afford to replace it twice.
---
Got 5x 10k today seems legit
---
They’re rarely that smart.  I don’t give them credit for thinking that through that far at all.  They wanted vni bots to get caught.  That’s probably about the extent of this.  After that it’s unintentional
---
Well for one those excavator killers are great for the economy and beyond that I'm not sure Eve players have ever needed a justification for killing expensive things. In the end it's probably for the best considering how negatively they gave impacted the economy as a whole regardless of null affiliation.
---
Wait to lose a few billons in just an alpha from a few tornados.
---
Seeing another razor member in reddit makes me happy
---
Lmao
---
Test blued up enough people (including paying Chinese Lots of $$$ ) to have such a Numbers advantage (although with all the Russians ) they can slowly chip away at a single main alliance with some sprinkled into the coalition
---
Eve 2019, nuke it from orbit
---
Shit. I didn't even think about this.
---
Whaaaaat?
---
As long as you're a PLA bot, you can go in period basis
---
Lol
---
Mine are like my children.  My favorite changes by the week and if one decided not to come back one day that’s a few years closer to retirement!
---
I get attached to fittings not ships.
---
Null is the new low sec.

I thought this was going to be a post about P3AK jumping ship (again).

nah, that big 10 year old blue doughnut is just *bustling* with activity..
