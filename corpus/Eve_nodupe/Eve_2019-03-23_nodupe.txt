I wish Alphas could fit a cloak :(
---
Kinda hard to "see" anything when the government actively prohibits *what* you can see. 
---
The camera and lens in back do it for me. The print's fucking huge.
---
Wait... faction frigates? You mean like the Comet...? Lol I’m confused
---
- isn't considered a character, he just worded his post poorly
---
Holy shit, they are onto us!
---
Right... running an Eve bot, I mean it might be fun to have the "free" ISK but no sense of accomplishment. Here, the whole point is creating the thing that wins, isn't it?
---
THIS
---
I can stop anytime I want.
---
Fight was over the last fortizar in Triumvirate. freshly conquered constellation in the pure blind region owned by French Connexion. TRI/WW/WOMBO/PL/NC vs PB Madness/INIT/Snuffed Out feat. V0lta who bombed everyone (poor TRI basis). [Link to BR](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001975/201903212200/) \- apparently BR tool is kinda derp mode right now.
---
I hope its full of weed.
---
Eve university has a wormhole campus for pretty much that I believe
---
&gt; Remember that Volume traded does not equal volume purchased from CCP.
---
Remember that we have access to data on one of those numbers and the other we are pulling out of thin air.
---
The market doesn't care if the plex sold was just purchased or is from someone's investment stash. The volume is steady over the long term. The scarcity of the material isn't because of the supply of plex. Its the demand that has changed. More people have access to the funds to purchase the same volume of plex. This causes prices to rise.
---
&gt; As seen in the comment below, some guy just put 577,000 plex onto the market himself, which is 1/3 of the daily volume
---
Take a look at my screenshot from this morning (today's market data was not a full day) and compare it to now. Yesterday 1.681m plex vs today 2.118m plex

The "best money can buy" for an alpha is gonna look something like this
---
    [Astero, Alpha]
---
    
---
    Nanofiber Internal Structure II
---
    Frostline 'Clavicula' Integrated Analyzer
---
    5MN Cold-Gas Enduring Microwarpdrive
---
    Cargo Scanner II
---
    Scan Rangefinding Array I
---
    Sisters Core Probe Launcher, Sisters Core Scanner Probe
---
    [Empty High slot]
---
    Small Gravity Capacitor Upgrade II
---
    Small Hyperspatial Velocity Optimizer I
---
    [Empty Rig slot]
---
    Hobgoblin II x15
---
I don't think this is cost effective though. This fit costs around 133mil. If you are an alpha doing exploration i would instead grabbing a T1 exploration frigate and fitting it up cheap as possible and going for a get in smash and grab and get out approach to doing exploration in dangerous space like wormholes and nullsec.
---
Something more like this:
---
    [Imicus, Alpha]
---
    Type-D Restrained Nanofiber Structure
---
    Relic Analyzer I
---
    Data Analyzer I
---
    PL-0 Scoped Cargo Scanner
---
    Core Probe Launcher I, Core Scanner Probe I
---
    Salvager I
---
    Light Electron Blaster I, Antimatter Charge S
---
    Small Emission Scope Sharpener I
---
    Small Memetic Algorithm Bank I
---
    Hobgoblin I x8
---
The performance of this fit is much lower than the Astero, it's not instawarp even on omega skills. It's got about 1/2 of the EHP (you could put armor on it instead of nanofibers to make that better.) And it does around 10dps less for warding off explorers without proper weapons. 
---
However it only costs around 700k isk for this ship. The average very low can value for null and wormhole space from what i've seen is around 1mil per can. Yes there are still cans that are completely empty or have like 2 carbon in them but on average you only need to crack open one can and get it back to sell before you are in the green with this ship. And this ship can even kill other unsuspecting T1 exploration frigates if you replace the cargo scanner (which you would use to avoid low value cans or go after higher value first) or the Data Analyzer (data sites are worth much less on average with the average low can being around 100k but are much more abundant) with a warp disruptor/scrambler.
---
Frat is terrible about this, frat asked us to help them one time and we ended up getting in a war with their blues who came in and attacked us.
---
Frat even dropped caps on us accidentally once and sat on grid with their dicks in their hands while the 100% blue grid went at eachother.
---
Watching my alt go from 1DQ to cloud ring in maybe 10 jumps without jump fatigue is fucking disgusting. I thought we got rid of teleporting across the map to help foster smaller groups.
---
I'm awestruck with how fast you guys are cranking these out! Amazing work!!
---
More alliance doesn't mean less power blocs, the maps you link to doesn't show coalitions. Fact is people have always found allies, because thats human nature. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I take no credit for this, but someone did in the forum thread:
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/FHkAZl1
---
This is by far the most annoying thing added to the game for me in the last 6 months...  Ok maybe not but it's super annoying
---
I showed you my triangle please respond.
---
So your saying instead of 'the world is ending' you are saying 'the end is nigh' potatoes potatoes i don't believe either to be honest.
---
We won't know for sure until the first major war/invasion/evictions happen. So doomspeaking about it doesn't really help imo.
---
infinite anoms are too much, make rergions deplete
---
from the LP store, all according to its faction of course! 
---
Some of the blocs would always be "friends", because some other bloc was stronger then them 1v1. So even if you have a few more coalitions, you dont get morer conflict
---
might as well make an eve 2 for that to happen, so probably not
---
banderlogs lol
---
what's your next example? SMA? 
---
FRT is very north aligned, also they had an amazing growth 
---
Thanks! This is one of those rare times when everyone being in different timezons actually helps with the workflow. We actually have a bit more tinfoil content for tomorrow (thanks to the initiative reconstruction within the community), just waiting on Zendane :P
---
it's nice that ccp seems to listen to it's playerbase now with the upcomming balance patch. i'm really looking forward to it!
---
This is the 7th or 8th time we contest that constellation over 5 years. Can anyone confirm/deny that Sort was gonna give that A2 constellation to us back when TMA/dumopsterco lived there?
---
Anyone injecting after about 40m is kinda dumb...
---
CCP make so many mistakes you dont need injectors, just wait for the free SP.
---
They should only be giving out SP for skill related issues 
---
Not really, as long as you can afford it, why not
---
Coincidence that there was a glut of "unidentified wormholes" spawning last month, just before all this kicked off...?
---
a decloaked stealth bomber please! 
---
Remove fatigue, restore passive income for alliances by holding sov/moons this will take eve back to what made eve great and made 50,000 people log in (most of who where not bots)
---
Battles of mid-size groups fighting it out without tidi is the best eve has to offer in my opinion. I bet everyone on grid enjoyed the battle even if they were on the losing side. If you have not experienced a fight like this you should try it out.
---
The year is 2021, There I am standing at my desk logging into EVE online to create a new character. Caldari? Minmatar? Whatever. Triglavians get 30 base attribute scores and a 10% modifer to all mutaplasmid modules to make up for the fact they cannot use implants. Sure you can't extract or inject a Triglavian but that just means everyone knows you're hardcore.
---
Do I pick Perun Clade, Svarog Clade or Veles Clade
---
Do I pick narodnya, Koschol or Navka
---
Does it matter? I'm a flippin Triglavian, I'm elite
---
Oor, active hull tanking madterrace.
---
&gt; I hope this leads to a reasonable discussion and debate instead of the usual reeee you get on here.
---
*narrator voice: It did not.
---
Dominix....dominatrix...
---
I drink a lot.
---
good fights all around  
---
too funny goons turned right around when they saw all the stuff in local
---
I like Stella, they'd undock, and sometimes the same ship classes for good fights
---
Honestly a great looking hulk of a ship! 
---
This was a pretty good read tbh, I like the little back story that you mentioned, as a newbro I find the info rather interesting
---
It's not, unless there's some amount of money I can spend that will ensure I always beat the other guys. Is there? No. 
---
Lanngisi is better than Osmon anyway, and it's still just highsec. The lower the sec status the more payout you get.
---
Scimitar with the emergency response skin. 
---
If you DM me when it’s done, I’ll throw ISK your way. Also can you do custom resolutions? 
---
:) Will do!
---
I define think hacking needs more uses, maybe let us hack system wide cyno hammers and beacons as well. Maybe a hack to reduce reinforcement timers that you get 1 shot at? Not sure if that would be balanced but right now it takes too long to kill structures 
---
Probably a Catalyst to gank the other exploration boats outside of highsec and scoop their loot.
---
Wasn't so much the test itself as it was the people doing the testing.  
---
"Subhuman" is putting it politely.
---
At first I thought it was on a table and those were books. I thought it was huge. Then I saw the camera in the background, and realized those were coasters...
---
Dang, hope you can make the next one.
---
Glad you feel that way. Be sure to tell cucks collectors alliance how you feel.
---
Meh, I hit a virus every damn thing I click on.
---
It's actually been a little better than usual imo. People are actually putting the ideas and opinions forward instead of just shitting on people for putting theirs forward.
---
I actually really appreciate this posting style. No verbose wall-o-text that nobody actually wants to read, facts are laid out nicely, and I know exactly what happened. Thanks and keep FCing!
---
I suppose you're right there, but I still think it would leave the door open to more backstab potential than there is currently. The more groups there are the merrier imo.
---
you could make a c2 site runner with a brutix, it won't be as good as a harbinger or myrm though. You can't use a brutix for abyssal because the only ships that can go into the abyss are frigs and cruisers (except t3).
---
100% this. And delay local updating for 30 seconds upon entering a system.  
---
Would literally turn this game around.
---
Bowhead
---
I know it's an ugly boat but I love my Drake and it would be amazing to see what you can do with it.
---
There's not really any point in an astero if you can't cloak tbh. Just use a T1 exploration frigate, fit it cheaply (under a million if you don't put a cloak on) and accept that you will get killed occasionally. I think the Heron is the best because of all those mid slots.
---
Or omega up and train for covops.
---
could you do the Vexor?
---
I posted one earlier but deleted it b/c I think there's a better one &gt;_&gt;
---
The Echo
---
It's Free! You're good to go if Ya wanna try out the game and You have a spare evening. (Free version has access to quite a few things)
---
What do you mean by "a sleeper site", because there are a lot. C1? C3? Was it an anomaly, or a relic?
---
Step 1: Download pyfa.
---
Step 2: Look up Karr's modified Rykki guide to sleeper sites
---
It was a c3 relic site and rats at the asteroids after doing more Home work I see now that c3 may be a bit too much for ol harby 
---
I am the lizard king
---
Please don't. This is all garbage. 
---
+1 for a hyperion
---
There is so much wrong with this thread, but you've definitely succeeded in providing a healthy supply of tinfoil for the sub :)

Why not? I found it interesting to read about how Eve used to be and stuff..
---
Il try and give you some advice I wish I was told when I started.
---
What makes eve stand out from other MMOs isn't its gameplay (infact most of the time it is rather poor when compared to other MMOs), what makes eve great is the friendship and bonds you create with players and what usually makes these big fights like B-R5RB isnt the gameplay of it, its the story and narrative behind it.
---
Its worth downloading and giving it a shot as a f2p, leave your initial group (they are called "corps" short for corporation) and make some friends. Its as easy as that.
---
What he doesn't mention is that all those 'strong independant alliances that didnt need no ~man~ coalition', in fact were all parts of only a few coalitions. 
---
Fatigue really made groups blue each other even more for mutual defense.
---
Ansiblex gates didnt do a goddamn thing to sov
---
Would be easy to detect in a coding game? Maybe if I use some body else's code it is because I am too busy to write my own, but at least if I am paying to play a coding game I will read the code diagonally? 
---
I wrote my own bot which ammounted to nothing after 100h of Screeps of course. I don't regret it at all.
---
Anyone have that copy-pasta handy?
---
I can’t pay for Omega because I’m in High School and have no payment method, and unless there’s some easy way to make a ton of ISK, I don’t have enough time to PLEX Omega each month
---
i thought the same think i was thinking it was 1.5m at the smallest, i was wondering how they were going to get it through the door...lol
---
I wish.  Too lazy to go hunt it down
---
you guys are gr8
---
Oh monkeys, they were nice to have in PB.
---
&gt; Tl;dr - Alliances ability to move around EVE universe due to Ansiblex gates is problematic. Localized conflicts are dying and player migration into super coalitions will only make the game map stagnant for years to come.
---
2 point, before ansiblex, alliance could only use WH to hit their arch enemy, now we can use ansiblex and be there whenever we want in less than 15 min, who here said easier to get into enemy territory is bad ?
---
Second thing eve is right now in stasis because CCP release 3 years ago a patch that change the nullsec meta, where renter empire, casino money and/or R64 used to be the way alliance get richer, are now replace by rorqual/supercarrier to make alliance **member** richer who then make their alliance richer (building dank titan or ratting taxes), we don't care if passive income who make alliance log once per month to get dank money is better or not than having hundred of player login all the day in shiny stuff to get money (even if as a player who still play this game and like hunting krab ship I have a strong opinion on this), but the thing is, only one alliance in the game read the patch note and adapt to it : Goonswarm Federation abuse it for a very long time, uncontested (well beside on reddit where leadership of other alliance were making fun of them for doing it) after 2 years ~ GSF (The Imperium) get very very rich, a line member can now afford a super/titan easily, the alliance can afford titan SRP and abuse of this money to shoot people who, after 2 years try to adapt to the patch, but get violently rekt. Legacy was the second one to adapt to this patch and today, NCPL&amp;co struggle to get into it. Why am I saying this ? It's because if nullsec is in stasis mode right now, it's not because of jump bridge fatigue free gate, it was like that before already, even worst some might say, nah, the real issue is, there is no way enemy of The Imperium/Legacy will ever have the chance to adapt to this meta, they took the train way too late and lose because of this, now we just all have to wait until the next nullsec meta and hope this time, The Imperium won't be the only one to adapt to a new meta  
---
Might as well get rid of burner missions from npc null since infinite pirate LP is just as silly if not more so.
---
It’s free soho for it! I downloaded it last year and have been addicted ever since then. It does have a steep learning curve but there’s so much you, do, and be a part of. 
---
Ok that makes more sense :)
---
Yeah C3s might be a bit heavy. Some of the sites also scram. Try a C2 :)
---
The datas/relics are also often harder than the anomalies
---
Ah,NPC null, it's an unassailable safe haven. Just a moment ago you were fighting against things being too easy. Pirate burners are one of the most extreme example of ridiculous money you can make in EVE and it far outpaces anom ratting AND rorquals before the nerfs came/come in. The only bonus on the rorqual side is at 10+ rorquals you can outscale the operation; awesome for the 70 players in the game that do that.
---
The pirate LP generation is bonkers and should be on the chopblock. Nerf LP by 35% minimally
---
I tried hacking three 4 cans the other day and hit blockers within 2 moves every direction on each can. Luck was not on my side. 
---
Can confirm. I have several dozen accounts that will be lapsing until plex straightens out
---
Lol Jita Local.... 
---
Really? That's annoying. I was hoping for a battleship or something in between, rather than go vni to carrier. Thats annoying though, and I just checked the ishtar details too; same damage between the two for 3x the price.... whack.
---
Is that an undocked faction super I see? Better dock it up.
---
Why are they getting evicted?
---
Passive income had people logging in? You have to log in to mine moons currently? 
---
Now you have timers in addition to miners to kill. 1-5B killmail smashing the Athanor.
---
I fail to see how more people log in for a private moon than for actual substantial citadel kms and dank miner frags
---
The Universe's mean temperature will reach 0 Kelvin before this happens.
---
I like how you made this about you. 
---
Oh now I understand what you were trying to say. But regardless, I meant it in a way that I got a brief overview of how Eve used to be..
---
Since you brought this up though, that means Eve has only been improving in a way, yet why do I see so many vets upset with CCP and the way Eve is right now?
---
I’m having a great time, I simply don’t play games I don’t like or I’m unhappy with, it’s not worth wasting my time posting how shit things are..
---
You dont get to say "nullbear". You are one. And a mechanic abusing asshat as well.
---
Who? 
---
Still not sold on 3D printers. This same end product could be better carved or moulded or machined etc 
---
Still looks like three bits stuck together like a pre painted air fix model. 
---
It doesnt matter what CCP does, there will always be a hardcore group of 'bittervets' bitching and moaning, and swearing that it used to be soooooo much better.
---
I wont say eve is perfect or new changes were for the better, but it IS moving forward whether we like it or not and generally not getting worse.
---
There's also the possibility that the other pages haven't gone live yet, given that page's source shows last edit was only a few hours before all this kicked off here.
---
The string "jajyjymylv6" looks highly intentional, especially given it's Svarog, usually the second of the three Clades to appear (so 3,\*6\*,9), and a fair few strings found via shifting/keyed shifts come up with likely looking options using Peruna+3 and  Velesian+9, although none get any results thus far. But I'm not sure if I'm on the wrong track, have already cracked it but the page isn't live yet, or am finding patterns in junk-code jibberish.
---
Still proving CCP is brain dead.
---
I used to care abouty stuff being lost in null,  now with asset safety I just pay the bill.
---
We lost another bit of danger. 
---
You giving or taking?
---
Can I borrow some tinfoil I appear to have run out 
---
Ya. I'm having a really hard time with this pic. It's messing with my eyes. What is it on? Is it huge? Where is the lamp how far? Is it just a super close pic? 
---
Pardon my ignorance, but why do you recommend regular reps over ancillaries?
---
You're gonna wanna give him the updated one:  
---
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml#)  
---
Imagine being this butthurt about getting ganked lmao. You highsec miners don't produce any material quantity of ships, the people mining in nullsec do. You are literally irrelevant and unironically calling people who engage in actual gameplay (PvP) the drones. Wew
---
I mean, its appearance changes quite noticeably when it activates. The first thing an intelligent person would do upon seeing such a bizarre room would be to observe their surroundings, including the gate.
---
The tank you can get on an Ishtar is incredible. 
---
The way it’s split it could be done on a lot of models pretty easily. Probably as low as an ender3.
---
This is a lot of words and all you really said was "I have no idea how a free market works".
---
I'd love to have a wallpaper of a phoenix firing missiles at a planet with an awesome background maybe of a far-off space battle ensuing in the distance. How much would that run me?
---
Time to stock on ZPC and crystalline!
---
Well the rodiva is what you would expect from a t1 logi compared to the t2. It has less repping power and less tank. It fits in as being better than traditional t1 logi but not as good as t2. It's tank is also in the mediocre range compared to peice point. 
---
Not for the price. You could buy a printer and print this and have the machine left over for a fraction of the cost of a carving, mould or machined version.
---
Total material for this is probably around $5-10 tops.
---
It's called "lifestyle creep" when as you earn more money, you start to spend more money (i.e. get a more expensive house with higher mortgage, nicer car(s) with high payments, etc). It's something you should work hard to avoid if you want to retire at an earlier age.
---
If possible use imgur for example over Gyazo. A much more pleasant experience for the end-user for watching images.
---
i moved my main into stranger danger from darkness a few months ago.  have met some great dudes and really enjoying wh life.  my darkness corp (with my alts) recently moved to nc.  definitely another upgrade!  loving the game at the moment
---
Eve o preview. Quicker/more convenient than alt-tab yet doesn't input BC so completely legal
---
Generally you will do some sanding, finishing, and painting depending on the use case. I have seen some cool cosplay that after finishing and a bit of metalic paint, you could never tell its 3d printed.
---
Scalding pass, etherium reach
---
Almost like I haven't been speaking the past 3 years about how people are moving under umbrellas.
---
Someone asked CCP Karkur at Vegas about this and she said no it can't be done.  
---
Machariel
---
I am making my money in null, so im a nullbear lol. Because booshing excavators is as easy as risk free anomaly mining, and burning all that money into suicide dreads is on a par with RMTing your money or getting a titan which you'll never use outside the umbrella.
---
SC, dude. SC!
---
Lol yikes

This is what your expectations might be:

OH BOY THIS IS NEAT

Scorpion + zarmazd + dps fleet

You probably won't get a response, looks like the dude created a throw away reddit account just to post this...
---
my 1 year old makes and posts videos of herself singing and she has 32 followers. blew my mind. 
---
Too late. The cat is out of the bag. Good luck getting it back in...
---
Again, you are wrong. On one of my characters I did just that, finished at around 77% accuracy.
---
You ARC guys are awesome! 
---
This stuff is so interesting.

is it me or does  that look like a blueprint or model for the supposed trig capital ship under construction?
---
So there was a 6 month lull and you are ready to claim nothing is going on? There are good, exciting, fights almost daily. If you don't think there is conflict, you do not understand what is going on with Eve. Just this past weekend you almost got to witness GSF destroy TEST if INIT would not have received warning in time to prevent their Titans from jumping into a battle.
---
There is a lot of conflict happening. Huge supercap fights? Not daily, no. But even during all out war they were few and far between.
---
The 6 month treaty between Imperium and DeadCo is over, and already skirmishes are happening again. There are several groups fighting over control of Pure Blind. Fraternity is searching everywhere for a friend. And, as you mentioned, there is always fun to be had in and around Geminate.
---
Combat Endurance
---
Ender 3 can have amazing results if properly tuned, about as good as any FDM printer can put out.  
---
eve 2 sounds really appealing to me. I'd throw in crowdfund money. 
---
space gopniks, i'm telling you
---

7o
---
The biggest difference is just reliability at this point. Something like an mk3s is substantially more consistent and reliable.
---
To be honest, if you are not afraid to lose it, I would use the astero. It has a much faster align time than the t1 exploration hulls.  If you're paying attention, and someone land in the site you're running you should be able to warp out before they can lock you.  About the only thing I would be afraid of is an interdictor uncloaking and bubbling you.  Or a smart bombing battleship waiting for you on a gate.  Or if your in Delve, a titan waiting to boson DD you on a gate.
---
For lows, I would fit 2 warp core stabilizers, nanofiber, and maybe inertial stabilizer.  If I remember right, the inertial stabilizer should get you below 2 second align time (writing this at work so I don't have any fitting information handy).  If not, rig one or 2 small low friction rigs until you are below 2 seconds.
---
Mids, your scanners, mwd, and final slot is up to you.  Highs, you can't really fit anything you can use since you're alpha.  Maybe a fireworks launcher so you can "shoot" someone when they land, and you're moonwalking out.

Following White Sky losing an R64 moon to Vastly Outnumbered and Shoot First + a few friends LSH pushed us off grid with there Nagas and anchored another Athanor.   
---
**\*Fight\***
---
We formed a Sniper Rokh fleet with a Wing of tackle Frigs (you boys rock!)  to counter the LSH fleet. We bridged into system and started on the structure when it became vulnerable. LSH bridged in there Nagas and warped in at range. Unable to break our reps and taking heavy fire they warped out to re collect themselves. 
---
When they came back in, we did a better job a locking them down and started Deleting there Nagas. After taking heavy losses they cleared grid and left the structure to die.   
---
Gf to all and see you at the next timer.

If I recall NPC "miners" have in a way always been a thing, they don't exactly mine but have refined minerals in their cargo. Worth catching shooting at if you see one at a belt while you're mining.
---
Now if they have a Diamond next to their name, you want to get the heck out of there.
---
So yeah. You're a nullbear, agreed. You play exclusively to use 1 mechanic, so you agree you abuse a mechanic. We're pretty much on the same page. You're a risk adverse little bitch.
---
no. next question.
---
(the session handling code that would have to be rewritten to accomplish this seems to be fuckin scary)
---
God dammit this happened right after I logged to get a burger! Also happy birthday!
---
Honestly I'm surprised at the horrible ship fits and suggestions in this thread. 
---
There are 2 choices for exploration if your alpha , the expensive fit (Astero) and the cheap fit (Heron) and they both perform about the same with the Astero coming with the added worry of losing 60 mil or whatever when you use it however 4 low slots means you can fit 4 warp scramblers and avoid solo gankers. 
---
No other t1 explor frigate comes close to the Heron. 
---
I won't post full fits because you know what you need mostly but I will tell you what you don't need. 
---
Cargo scanner- Useless. yeh you might be able to avoid a can that doesn't have alot of isk in it but isk is isk and Ive never felt like the isk has not been worth it. It all adds up. It takes up a mid slot that you can use for literally anything else. Plus if you leave 1 can in a site your the worst kind of person and should be ganked. 
---
Rigs- the only rigs you should have are the 2 that improve your hacking into Data and Relic sites. Trust me you'll get bad luck sometimes and get 3 antivirus and stuff in a row and these rigs make all the difference. Nothing sucks more than a can exploding in your face and you losing 20 mil or even 80 mil because you just were not able to hack it with your virus strength.
---
This is the main reason why the Heron and the Astero are on par with each other even though the Astero is supposedly a better ship. The Heron has 400 rig slots while the Astero only has 350...meaning you can only fit one hacking improvement on the Astero. 
---
Frostline 'Clavicula' Integrated Analyzer - Yeah just no never in your life ever use this when your an alpha. This is why the heron is the best ship. You have those extra mid slots for a relic and a data analyzer which both perform better than the frostline by itself. 
---
What you should have--
---
Warpdrive--- This is tied for first for the most useful item on your ship. one cycle of this will get you between cans. and when you reach sleeper sites to find 120 mil cans you'll thank me when you hit 3 cans before the sleepers arrive
---
In conclusions---- 
---
I know you've been exploring for months and want an upgrade from your current ship but this is the game and the Heron is hard to beat as the best ship. Your an Alpha and CCP made you handicapped unless you pay, thats the way the game works get over it. The astero I would say is only 10% better than the heron when it comes to exploring and I hope you can get one and use it. It feels nice and makes things a bit smoother. But you'll cry when you lose it. If your like most explorers and just doing this for the money then do explore in a heron or astro and start training those skills for lvl 4 missions and incursions. Thats the only way to make more money than explore right now as an alpha and takes months of research. You'll be able to afford your battleship WAY before your can actually use it efficiently in battle.

This is my layout using 2 monitors. You're seeing one and a half screens (the other half of the second monitor is Discord), and there's enough room to monitor 6 clients comfortably through Eve-O preview. Web browser goes full-screen on second monitor under eve-o preview.
---
The Eve client UI is organised around fleet PVP for the most part, with fleet broadcast window + overview + watchlist + locked targets all in the top-right quarter of the screen so you don't have to constantly move your eyes all over the place.
---
Spots for probes, drones, and fighters are indicated.
---
I think this kind of layout can still work with a single monitor, you'd just have to have Eve in windowed mode taking up 2/3 or so if the screen horizontally. Might be a bit awkward with your 16:10 monitor tho. Could try having Eve windowed taking up 4/5s of the screen vertically, with 4 Eve-O client overlays along the top/bottom of the screen, maybe.

All 3d printers will require maintenance and tuning, also mk3 is nearly 4x the price.  You could have a photon an Ender 3 and still have a good chunk of money left over.

What does the diamond mean?
---
Idk where you get your titans from but mineral cost is in the mid 30’s for a titan depending on how you source your minerals.
---
A diamond means that said NPC uses a separate AI script. Basically more deadly and will probably have friends that will point/web/kill your ship.
---
If a mining fleet with diamonds is at a belt snd they are red to you. They will spawn a fleet that is a tough challenge to even well fitted blingy battleships. Imagine a player fitted 10-20 frig/cruiser gang coming to help friendly miners from you.

No other person spoke about people migrating under umbrellas as much as me. It's completely normal that I linked another post talking about similar issues, and offered my perspective on the issue OP is talking about.

Hey, tell him he should check his belt tension. Some of the banding artifacts on those prints can come from loose drive belts.

Doesn’t help that the big alliances now have a metric fuck ton of Supers and Titans.

That actually sounds pretty cool!

How often are there coalition level backstabs in this game?

How often are there alliance level backstabs?

Co2 turning in wwb is the last time it a major alliance turned on its allies

Tempest! :D. Or an orca. Or possibly the rag.

Fucking ditto
---
Citadels are the reason. any alliance that can throw down multiple keepstars will remain in place until the end of eve. 
---
You're a fucking imbecile. I dont have an umbrella, nor supers. I'm a fucking wormholer. And you're still a risk adverse piece of shit. I take and lose fights often out of my own pocket. I refuse my corps SRP because I run our SRP. I take fights outnumbered, out shipped, and out skilled. I take the bait. You boosh excavators because its risk free. "Emergent game play"? No. It isnt a new meta, it isnt ingenious.  It's cheaper and easier than AFK vni ratting. You multi box because your personality is so toxic others avoid you like the plague. And every 3rd word out of your man trap is about "goons bad". You're fucking annoying and need to biomass your reddit account.
---
 the newer laser or LCD curing printers, resolution and quality are amazing. There is the one LCD one for 500$ that is really awesome before you sink in another 150-200$ in custom parts to make it better than most 2000$ printers. 
---
To be fair SMA lost 5 caps to a fleet of 15 prophecies, 4 logi, and 2 bhaalgorns. Easy to see how they lost that space.

- Sabre

- Scythe
---
That's not really 1v11. 
---
That's the Photon that was mentioned earlier, but the resin for that is far more expensive than FDM consumables. SLA is also not very good for functional parts. (Also can't generally scale to prints the size of this post for example.)
---
I keep having a hard time telling whether this is a legit CCP produced video or fan-made content because it looks so good.
---
I recall hearing that a FOB will have an influence over it's adjacent systems as well. I assume that's what happening here, just a Blood Raider looking for content around it's base.
---
that moment you REALLLLY don't feel like dying.   so you take more dmg than titans before dying.....
---
Ran into those guys a few times 'running sites'...
---
Always a good fight of them. Or a clobbering from them, depends how you look at it. 
---
Very true. For me I paint miniatures and have found that that extra 30-60min of prep work is just not worth it with FDM. Using acetone vapour baths is the most efficient way but the fumes are way worse than the what you get off of the LCD/SLA printers, imo. It's also not great for thin parts like swords/bows/guns so you have to hand prep it and that just takes so long. I get my thing is a specialized case but I'd rather have a small awesome raven then a huge one that would take hours to get pretty. 
---
Why isnt this higher?

&gt;&gt; Might as well just all be gay, that way we don't need chicks anymore. Seems like sound reasoning.

---
I just spent 200b to suicide naglfars just to kill about 6 times much. Nearly all players in Eve would have made a different choice with that kind of money.
---
You think you being a wormholer makes it better. But the fact that you can talk like you talk without a vested nullbear interest makes you even more retarded lmao.
---
Believe it or not Eve is a PvP game, moons where always the priority over sov fights someone had to defend them and repaired them. No damage cap meant you could take two hours to kill a POS or you could bring enough to kill it in five minutes. And only having one timer meant you would always get fights or you would always win the objective. Why would you not go back to that?
---
Hel
---
Keepstars should be limited to one per alliance and one per region. These things were supposed to be crowning achievements of entire alliances or even entire coalitions. Instead they get treated like just another staging structure.
---
Docking supers and titans without limitations is a colossal flaw, but with proper and substantial limitations it could be a reasonable thing.
---
Such a limitation would also make the destruction of these structures matter *much* more. As for answering the issue of existing multi-Keepstar groups, the unfortunate most realistic method would simply be to prevent further anchorings by groups that already have one and just wait out their eventual destruction. Nothing in Eve lasts forever.
---
Also block the anchoring of Keepstars and all XL structures in WH space, period, even if they are technically destructible it's just poor form.
---
Delete large and small skill injectors and make Daily Alpha Injectors universally available (with the current one-per-day restriction) and useable up to 20 million SP with no diminishing returns.
---
New players can still have their catch up mechanic, but changing flavor-of-the-month and injecting into capitals from new toons is much less viable. It's also great for anyone who subs new alts.
---
As long as they still cost PLEX to get, there's still income for CCP, too.
---
I agree with you completely - this is why I made this post. I knew I wasn't the only one who cared greatly about my EVE UI
---
Misguided and false. Asset safety is a boon to small groups, and especially those with limited (or nonexistent) JF capabilities.
---
Salvage from citadels could easily be retabulated to be viable without screwing over the victims, especially now that you can't store items in indestructible sov null stations and either firesale or try to retake the station if you lose control of it.
---
Asset safety doesn't affect ships in build as construction materials drop as loot.
---
The issue is unlimited simultaneous builds and the increased safety of an XL citadel with sov null's supercap umbrellas.
---
I wouldn’t take a fight against KSTY Mistari unless I also have 60k dps
---
I think you will find more people care about the ui then not. 
---
Making NPC Null space more profitable just gives us sov-Null peeps an incentive to conquer it.
---
Instead, I'd argue for more opportunities to make good isk that aren't tied to the specific geography/region. A buff to Abyssal rewards would probably help that a lot. Basically find a way to make it easier for people living in NPC Null to make a living without making the space itself more valuable to hungry neighbors with large super fleets.
---
This and sov fights don't force capital brawls any more, now you have these massive stock piles of caps that only come out when a keep is on the line. 
---
Osprey Navy Issue pleassseeeeeee
---
Ancillary reppers do provide better repping power, but when the paste runs out, it's worse than t1 and you have a 1 minute reload timer. A tech 2 or faction doesn't require paste to have good rep amount and thus you can perma run it as long as you have cap. 
---
Ancillary reppers, both shield and armor, should be thought of as a burst repper for when you need it.
---
There were jump bridges before jump gates... what’s changed in that regard really?
---
Also the biggest issue with supercap proliferation is the keepstar, any retard that can fly a carrier on their main can now fly a super whereas before you’d need like a 3rd alt that can fly caps
---
Fucking spodbrain retard

Hoping that isn't a solid print, that's a lot of filament
---
those jump gates are overpowered
---
just make them have no damage cap, no reinforcement timer, cost 5b, be outside of gun range, and give them like 15 million ehp
---
You tell that to the Severance jump gate that got reinforced tonight
---
You are right. Sry for beeing downvoted
---
So here's the problem...
---
&gt; They're supposed to be like normal stargates in every way
---
Says who?
---
&gt; apparently they get all the safety of citadel dps protecting them
---
Right... b/c they are a Sov structure. They are nothing more than a replacement for the old POS Cyno mechanics. But instead of needing to always park a Titan at each end so you can ferry your members back and forth, you have a permanent "Titan" gate sitting at each end.
---
If you thought other people were going to put their time, effort, and money into building YOU a shortcut, you're wrong. They built themselves a shortcut, and you're lucky you can use it at all.
---
That will not help migration in any way.
---
Personally, I think it is a type of structure that is being encountered 
---
GFs all around...see you guys on the next moon...and the next...and the next...and the next...
---
Oh no a c4 corp getting evicted a real shame!
---
Exactly.
---
https://zkillboard.com/ship/35841/
---
Seems like they are killable to me!
---
Says who? listen to all the language used when they announced these. It was supposed to be the trade off of removing jump fatigue, they were supposed to be indistinguishable from normal gates. If they're not gonna be like normal gates then JFatigue should apply to everyone.
---
If you're an alpha, don't use an astero. Yes, it's got better bonuses than a t1 exploration frigate. It doesn't matter. The point of an astero is the cloak, which you can't use. Without it, the hugely increased cost is not justified. Trying to use an astero will cost you more from your losses than you'll gain from increased loot. Stick with a cheap t1 exploration frigate - you can lose twenty of those for less than the cost of one astero, and the astero will *not* give you twenty times the performance. 
---
Pirate miners spawn in areas of space that you find that pirate normally.
---
Over half these kills are people that abandoned that space. Is that really your best argument for their killable? or you do you mean the ones with over a 100+ people in the fleets as killing it? These things have way too safe. The CSM acknowledged it as well.

https://www.eveonline.com/article/phs7yj/navigation-structures-inbound
---
&gt; With these first new navigation structures we have a few goals that we are striving to achieve:
---
&gt; - Replace the functionality of current jump bridges, cyno beacons, and cyno jammers with improved structures that are easier to deploy, use, and understand
---
- Ensure owners have granular control over access to their services
---
- Ensure attackers have ways to disrupt the infrastructure of their enemies
---
Already, I'm not seeing "an alternative to Stargates". What I do see is "a replacement for jump bridges". And I also see "granular control over your services". So the owners have rights, not the users.
---
&gt; Unlike previous long-distance teleportation technology available to capsuleers, Ansiblex gates enable movement for some capital ships as well as avoiding jump-fatigue for their users.
---
Working as intended. The gate is moving you from A to B, so you don't suffer fatigue like you would if you were moving yourself. Or at least, that's what the fluff text says. I don't see why you'd suffer fatigue if someone else's Titan is moving you, but whatever. =)
---
Eve has always been a game of risk vs. reward. When all these changes occurred to make capital ownership and captaincy much easier to obtain, it was a no-brainer to spend most of your time making that isk and dabble a little in PVP (for most people, including myself at least). These changes in April definitely shift the spectrum to such a point that I myself have considered not even bothering with ratting and mining anymore. Sure, the rorqual is still the premier mining ship in large nullsec alliances and the carrier is still the premier ratting tool, but perhaps now the risk will be high enough that I don't bother with it. I've stockpiled enough isk to ride out fleet fights, ship losses, etc. for a while and I still table in industry with t2 ships. 
---
I guess I wonder how many other people were also on the fence as to whether it will be worth it? I don't think so anymore.
---
Good on you brav. Best advice I can give you is just go out there and try kill things.
---
Record your fights so you can watch them so you can learn quicker. Don’t be afraid of the red.
---
And lastly.. FUCK SNUFF
---
It worked basically exactly how they work now it’s just back then you had a decision on whether you wanted triage or damage fit. 
---
Activate the triage module and you are immune to basically all effects non friendly and enemy on you except for neuts. You could not be repaired. As a trade off you got huge boosts to remote reps and local tank. 
---
Back then you could refit in space too while in combat. There would be a lot of refitting mid battle. If primary then quickly refit to max tank, as soon as you’re no longer then back to cap regen fit for reps and so on. 
---
With the exception of he in space refit they worked almost exactly how fax work today. Except now you have to decide do you want a damage carrier or triage before you even undock by choosing the actual ship and not just the modules. 
---
So it's perfectly normal then? Does that mean that he has a fleet nearby that can warp in or am I still pretty safe just mining away in the same belt?
---
I'd love to have an Orthrus so I can look at cancer while flying cancer.

Brutix Navy Issue with spirit skin and neutron blasters.

While you are right in certain situtation at that time eve had at least 5-6 neutral zones with conflict. Now it has 0. Fatigue was a bless for the game.
---
No, the entire login system server side would have to be re-written to handle how you are loaded in.
---
That is a list of mostly uncontested gate kills, if contested by an active station gunner who actually knows what the fuck they are doing  its a pain in the ass, if you add a defending fleet to the mix its a fucking nightmare. 
---
Give me the anom rework and offensive cyno inhibition changes I want, I'll give you an Eve where it doesn't even make sense to live with more than 10000 accounts in a single region as a single alliance.
---
Then how come eve dropped from 60k pilots online to 30k. And while it had 60k the average accounts / player was something like 1.3 and now is more like 3. So when you see 30k ppl online is more like 10k max. Vets are bitter because they saw eve early greatness and potential. And thats gone.
---
[removed]
---
Power blocs are relevant only during timer warfare.
---
The problem is about spontaneous warfare and supercap umbrellas. People living more spread out in smaller alliances would affect that.
---
Anyone who puts more than 1 super/titan per char is retarded anyway, you buy more chars and multibox em
---
Haven’t there always been two main coalitions ever since Bob vs redswarm/NC? 
---
Reducing the level of turbomaxcanceraids needed to build and own supercaps didn't impact their main balance issues - mainly, being so retardedly good they're unbeatable by anything other than more supercaps. 
---
It just made it less turbomaxcanceraids to join the "people who matter" club. This isn't a bad thing; since the club exists and everyone outside is fucked, we may as well make it easier to get in so people can play the game. 
---
If you made people punch themselves in the balls to own titans, people would still do it, and the game would be dominated by the chief ballpuncher alliances. We'd have the same core issues, our balls would just ache a lot more.

Eve-Uni is the only corp in WH space dedicated to training people afik. Most WH groups are small enough that there is no reason to have a dedicated newbrow wing. That being said many are newbrow friendly and will gladly teach you what you need to know, even if they aren't a corp dedicated to doing just that.
---
You would need to change the sites you run in that case. DED sites are good isk, but are generally run in things like T3Cs instead of VNIs. Another option is smart bombing macherials. You can use them to blitz anoms, but this requires coordination and multiple characters. You could alos try the abyss. Generally run in gilas, you can make great ISK once you get use to manually piloting. In high level sites you can easily pull in several hundred mil an hour, though the risk is there if you aren't experienced.

Unredeemed PLEX is apparantly carried on  CCPs books as a liability as it represents services yet to be claimed. Deleting the PLEX removes the liability at no cost to them.

Yes, though you can use something as small as a small, unfueled tower somewhere right now. That will change when war HQs are introduced, but for now it is a rather minor hurdle.

They are easily killable even with the citadel manned, as long as your fleet know what they are doing and have the common sense to warp away its easy, torp bombers are 1 such example, warp off when the citadel yellow boxes you, warp back, keep shooting, it's up to the defenders to get a fleet on that fate if they really want it

You either were not playing back then or are viewing the past with rose-tinted glasses. Your changes will not result in the goals you seek.
---
Eve has always been dominated by the people with the most friends. Eve will always tend towards a bipolar balance of power. It was a bipolar universe then and it is likely to remain that way forever. If we are lucky, there will be brief periods of instability as new groups form, old blocs collapse, but Eve will essentially remain in a Cold War state until the server shuts down. The last time we had a great period of instability was when essentially all of Eve decided the Imperium was a paper tiger and tore it to shreds. But then those people simply switched places with the Imperium. 
---
Another barrier to new groups forming is that there are simply not that many people with the time, energy, and personality to lead groups. They tend to join together with like-minded people of similar competency levels to share the immense burden of running a corporation, alliance, coalition, etc. In sovereign space, these have never been jobs for a "casual player." There is too much work involved for that.
---
Now, you can make life easier for smaller, less well-organized groups. And CCP should do this... Because every time they have tried to "make life harder for the big blocs", what they have actually done is raise the barrier for everyone else who doesn't already have the dozens-hundreds of capable hard core players who can handle the new burdens. That won't fix the bipolar balance of power, but it will make it easier for more people to become real players in the balance of power game. One thing that should be done is to add more NPC constellations throughout sovereign space. These can function as lillypads for logistics, safe havens for retreat, and staging areas for guerrilla warfare and harassment campaigns. These NPC constellations do not need great monetary resources. They just need unkillable NPC structures and relatively easy logistics to and from Empire space. They are simply a way to ensure that there is always some player-provided risk.

---
I dont think that the current situation is really because of the sov or citadel mechanics. The problem is as an alliance in nullsec you must grow to survive, stagnation leads to death eventually. Growing means more numbers, more systems. To get systems you need allies.
---
The only problem from a sov/citadel perspective is that those things make you settle down more and fight for your sov. If you have more nomadic mechanics, than sure, you will have more smaller entities.
---
Ehhh your point on faxes is kind of moot. You have to remember that triage was still a thing and all the big groups would do was drop several hundred slow cats with capital reps to keep their supers and titans alive. Fax just changes the fleet compositions. It did not create some repping potential that was previously non existent 
---
Ahh no wonder I couldnt reach you on discord, PM the deets.
---
They are a bit OP but for 0 of the zeros you list
---
Destroyer hulls don't get enough love.
---
1. Magus. I don't think I've ever seen art of the algos hull even though it's ridiculously intricate. Then again I spent a lot of hours staring at it as a newbro and I've had a soft spot for it ever since. 
---
2. Confessor. Best looking T3D but it gets a lot of appreciation already unlike the algos hull.
---
As far as cruisers/BC's, Minmatar have it on lock.
---
Ah. That makes sense. I tend to fly around a lot in wormholes (wormholer btw) so cap is a bit more valuable to me. The fear of getting neuted out is real. That line of thought makes good sense in null // when you have cap logi // etc. Thank you for the response.
---
Hope you know you have to go large like first. 
---
If you don't shoot the miners they won't aggress, tho, will they? If there are other ships than mining ships you have to be worried I think.
---
Stay tuned.
---
If it doesn't have a diamond and/or isn't actually mining you can shoot them and in case of haulers really should be.
---
This is more kills in same amount of time than I would see with Jump Bridges, which is what this is replacing.
---
They are killed more often than what they replaced, so not sure what your gripe is.
---
y'all are not seeing the point this dude is making
---
one moderately large subcap fleet (hacs or bcs) has less mass than *one* capital. putting a coalition worth of fleets through an ansiblex uses less LO than putting a couple of triage through with them for reps, let alone a capital fleet
---
and it's not so much the cost, because the cost of jump fuel isn't really an issue for a group like goons or panfam, we've been living on the fat of the land for years and have plenty of money for LO - the issue you run into trying to put capital fleets through ansiblexes is that LO isn't small or particularly easy to source in those quantities. to keep a bridge network fueled to the level required to push capital fleets through, you'd need to have dedicated ice mining ops pretty much constantly, and you'd need to be titan bridging freighters full of LO all around your space constantly as well
---
it's not the cost
---
it's the *logistics*
---
it's just not worth the effort to keep gates fueled like that when you could just travel fit your caps and gate them instead for free and without making your logistics team want to kill themselvse
---
Off, orbit 500, assuming you can hold down the confessor.
---
If you're trying to orbit in too tight of a circle, your agility (as great as it is) won't let you maintain your speed and the sig bloom will make you easier to hit.
---

1. Vagabond. CCPLZ give it 40km range so I can fly it in kitey nanogang.

3. Stratios. Perennial favorite.
---
Shoutout to the manticore for being such an aggressive, industrial looking design and being the first ship I ever did PvP in.
---
That is the most infuriating thing ever. Every other time I go for locking whoever is scramming me that fucking thing pops up. They should bake it a button instead.
---
I rather be able to log in a specific character on each account with the launcher
---
Because they were never designed to function as a regular gate. They are replacing Jump Bridges, which, iirc, you could use while tackled.
---
This isn't directed at you personally, but that last sentence is so WVE. You'll see more of me on the battlefield as soon as blah blah blah. Every krab says that. There's always been time to sit in rorqs for hours, but can't find a little bit of time for that pvp just quite yet.

Ha, sorry. Hope you follow through! Good luck!

Aww mannnnn, there you go, throwing facts in. Can't do that, Apollexis doesn't believe in facts!

The greatest accomplishment of Satan was convincing Man that he doesn't exist.  You're right, I'm full of sh*t, go back to sleep.
---
He’s right, but cost isn’t the limiting factor in sending supers fleet through the gates, it’s the logistics of keeping the gates fueled
---
"Settle down more and fight for your sov" what sov fights you see in eve atm?
---
i heard karmafleet was recruiting
---
Move to another keepstar? Then the next. Then the next. And so on and so forth. 
---
This is just a rare standard belt NPC. It transports a bit of ore, so  people call it a hauler spawn. There's bigger versions of it in the more dangerous regions. Domain is a Sansha region, so it is normal to see that guy there.
---
Jump bridges were not based on standings.
---
Blames rental ticks and RMT.
---
"Except for FRT". Literally the most insane botting empire and RMT shitshow.
---
Yeah. People want them out. Shocker...
---
it's a sandbox mmo, which means there is close to zero content or goals and you have to make your own way into the world by finding something that interests you and pursue it
---
Sweet thanks. I definitely have to play it more then.
---
Have you read any history book lately? Can you please tell me which independent entity managed to sustain its Territory for more than 100 years? Cause it's only the Byzantines and the only reason that happened is because they puppeted everyone and made allies with everyone in their borders. It's amazing you are implying that "people that have connections shouldn't have so much power". This is literally the number one way to keep sovereignty in most situations.
---
I wouldn't be fine with it if people "connecting" more to other people didn't give you an advantage. It's how alliances and federations were meant to be. Even in real life situations.
---
Usually in programming "way harder than it sounds" means "we designed it to not do that and there is no way we are spending resources to refactor it". Which in turn is slang for "fuck you no".

---
&gt; How did triage modules work back in the day when carriers used to fit them?
---
more or less the same as they do now, with some small differences
---
&gt;What effect did they have on the ship and its capacity for remote repair?
---
the repair range bonus wasn't cooked into the triage module itself pre-citadel, it was on the hull itself. carriers pre-citadel could rep for a considerable amount outside of triage. triage's bonuses basically amounted to 50% cycle time and 100% rep amount on local and remote reps, and ewar immunity. t2 triage had a 20% cap usage reduction as well
---
&gt;What drawbacks?
---
can't move, can't jump, can't use ewar. that's about it
---
&gt;How did carriers work together as logi?
---
triage could "weave," meaning two or more carriers would alternate triage such that one would rep and cap transfer the other from triage while the non-triage was refit for full tank, entering triage on full cap and armor
---
carriers as "logi" was probably slowcats, which worked more or less the same as guardians do, only slightly less efficiently. archons (and chimeras i guess) don't have a bonus to cap transfer efficiency, but they still generate cap at skill 4/5, so carriers would fit capital cap transfers and form a chain just like cap chaining logi do, then just rep whatever needed repping, while also doing damage with drones or fighters
---
i heard james was planning to give you the password to secret minerbumping channel
---
Given the resources required would be completely scrapping and rewriting the log-in systems from scratch...yeah, it's reasonable to not want to commit to that when they could fix pretty much everything else on the same timeframe (and if they fuck up, no one can log in at all until they do a complete roll back and basically write off months+ of a whole team's work before deciding to start again or shelve it with zero progress).
---
&gt; Is it worth now after the balance of haw to get a titan?.
---
yes, if you have the money and spare character
---
haws were only ever a small part of what makes titans truly useful. titans are instruments of coalition warfare. they do a shitload of dps with capital guns and massed targeted dd volley is the only thing that can reliably kill other titans in heavy tidi. additionally, long-range titans are the most reliable method of killing keepstars (and also other citadels but you can mostly kill those with subs), as you can sit them at 290-300km shooting the keepstar with fax outside 300km and due to the way keepstar dds bounce they will never touch the fax and never kill a titan either
---
supers are much more versatile than titans and if you only get one you will probably get much more use out of a super than a titan. that said, if your flair is accurate, you should probably aspire to own both
---
Curse, Vindicator, or Hel
---
And definitely will donate cuz that wallpaper looks amazing 
---
If I can suggest you something it would be to go step by step. It's very easy to set a goal in EVE thats very far away and only ends up demotivating you but the game has so much to offer that you can go from one acivable goal to another until the big ones are within reach.
---
Apparently you have a lot of information on botting in FRT, could you share that with CCP instead of shitposting on Reddit about it?
---
Already have. multiple times.
---
Uhhmmm.... Weren't they based on knowing the forcefield password or smth? Actually, I just remembered a fight where we were able to chase hostiles through a JB because we were blue to the POS owners?
---
I doubt its a bigger change than a 64bit client. Or the new launcher. Yeah it's hard but I doubt it's really THAT insane.
---
I do think you have some valid points. Personally from what Ive seen, and the people Ive talked to that have played the game far longer then me, the problem seems to be linked to content.
---
Eve is a fantastic game, that let you explore and exploit an entire universe, as you, the pilot, see fit. Unfortually, it seems its not usually worth it battleing it out with another alliance, as there are not good enough rewards for doing so other then  "having something to do/content".
---
What I would love to see in this game is some sort of endgame/
---
Condor or Widow
---
You’re in Tri right? Remember when CPA did a fleet in Gilas we were trying to defend a CENTI ihub that they decided to be useless for, we used their JB to get back close to Y-F before the ihub exploded... i don’t know the specific mechanics of JBs vs JCs but I think that other alliances could use JBs
---
Too much sov (or not enough initiatives to hold more sov) not enough players?
---
Are the capital shipyards past the new gate in t5s? 
---
If someone is talking about unlimiyed supply in a Sotiyo I assume ships that are ready. Not that they still have to be put in the oven when he loses one. 
---
What I would love to see in this game is some sort of endgame/seasons/time-limited content, that would force the superpowers to fight over objectives on a more regular basis. This would maybe, hopefully, make it so that you would see more backstabbing, more competitiveness and more change in space on a constant basis. How such an idea could be implemented witout ruining the sandbow is a valid question, in the other hand. 
---
Back in the day I played several strategy-games online, of the point and click type. These games were usually season-based, and to earn the glory you were forced to compete against and together with other alliances. What really made these games fun, were the scheeming and plotting, and of course the fighting. You never knew in peace-time when or what something was going to happen, but that suddenly someone would try to invade you space and hell would break loose. Everything that happened, were actions made towards the goal, winning the season. The only way you win Eve today, is by quiting it. 
---
Because you're better off spinning up another character for say an exploration character after you have more SP, it will cost less injectors, im not buying injectors at 150k SP, even at 840m that is ridiculous. 
---
Injectors also have to shoulder some blame for a mass increase in supers, titans and faxes and rorquals... the last of which caused their own set of issues and contributed to todays current plex price.
---
Some background: ive played eve since '06, when titans were totalling under 20 in the game and a doomsday would wipe out a whole grid, so to see thousands of titans in game now is eye popping to say the least.
---
Yeah I was the same, sold all my rorquals and the characters, injected a few extra pvp toons and have plenty left to dabble in markets, otherwise just gonna pay my subs, do abyss for any money I might need and just have fun again in eve 
---
It's a rare random spawn room you can get when you enter t5 abyss. There are a lot of enemies, and conveniently you don't need to defeat all of them to escape through the gate
---
Great work OP, Marshal please :) And maybe a Carrack from SC? 
---
The new gates allow force projection too easily without tradeoffs. The fuel use for subcaps isn‘t high enough to be noticeable, they can be activated even warp-scrammed.
---
If Fatigue doesn’t return for the gates they should either be usable for everyone (wasn‘t this how the old POS bridges worked?) or not placable on Grid with citadels to give them some balance.
---

Maybe not bigger, but roughly equal, and if you have the choice to dedicate X resources to something that will work and future-proofs your product, or X resources to something that'll _maybe_ work (but possibly make the game literally unplayable until it's completely un-done) and is only a QOL issue... smart businesses would laugh that that's even being offered as a choice.

Depending on your agility I would go for 500m orbit without MWD, or if your Astero is instawarp fitted 1000m with MWD on.
---
Great post. I appreciate you clearing up some of the details. With that said, while those details may be important to the narrative, they don’t fundamentally change the point: which is that for whatever reason, Eve wars are almost never wars of annihilation. A diplomatic plea bargain that lets everyone recover is the normal outcome to an Eve war. Whether due to fatigue or friendship, Eve wars tend to preserve the status quo ante. Organizations don’t usually die, they simply relocate.
---
I am well-aware of Eve’s tendency to burn out content creators - at all levels. It’s one of the reasons I oppose attempts to “make things harder for the big blocs” because it tends to burn out content creators and cause the remaining ones to clump up where they can share the burden.
---
Finding a work-life-Eve balance is a real challenge for almost everyone who loves to play this game.
---
HK was peanuts though, now try it against goons or test and see how it goes.
---
Tbh only way for goons to get evicted is either an event like WWB with TEST against them or imploding internally (cough BOB cough)
---
I like the idea of more 'neutral' zones in null. Would encourage players like me to venture out there: currently there's very few areas where I'd not just be dropped by locals for being in 'their' space, and usually a bajillionty jumps through hostile gatecamps to get there, and again to get home, is not worth the risk. Having more 'open' zones where I at least have a dockable station, whether as a target destination or as a safe place to sit out a stalker or nip to the loo during a longer travel, would make it feel like a viable option.
---
Like i said earlier, we won't really know how "broken and op" it really is or isn't until the first wars invasions and evictions since their implementation start happening.

  You'll never get a perfect system for everyone. Welcome to an open sandbox mmo.

Isn't this what people in /r/Eve asked for post space aids?
---
Tell that to HK and the north that lost 5 in a day...
---
People need to read empires of eve. Since 2005 it's been major empires vs .amor empires. The great war again BoB is an example, and that was two thousand and FUCKING 5. 
---
Depends on your standing: below -5, and they will agrees just because you're on grid. Also proximity can trigger it, so if you approach them, even without firing or in a non-combat ship, they will smoosh you. 
---
Plus, the diamond miners/haulers warp off when engaged, and summon reinforcement waves that scram/web, so it's not worth hanging around to find out if they care about you being there.
---
"except for FRT"

  lmao

Are you actually that dense?

Not everything has a high volume, things such as officer mods, super/structure BPOs, rare commodities, etc.

Generally it depends on your experience and where you are exploring. Generally if you aren't a experienced explorer I would always go for cheap T1 explo frigates, because you will die pretty often. Same goes for nullsec exploratiion where I also would advise to stick to T1 frigates unless you have enough ISK already that you don't mind loosing a bunch of Asteros. Lowsec exploration is where the Astero can be extremely useful for alpha clones, because even with bad skills you can just fit 4x interna stabilizer in it and be immune to lowsec gate camps + if you pay attention escape anyone trying to catch while you're in a site. In WHs Asteros can also be useful for alphas, even without a cloak. Just fit 4x warpcore stabs and simply warp away if someone starts shooting you.
---
So my original statement applies, if it isnt going to sell dont contract it, find someone to contract it to then contract it. 
---
The need to allow us to bind HINTS like that to a key like SHIFT.. so Holding SHIFT and mousing over anything throws those hints.
---
Annoys me when in my carrier and those hints pop up every time I mouse over the fighters guns etc. let me see that if I hold a key to show it, otherwise dont show it.
---
I know a solution to this
---
1. Make it possible for corps to have thousands of members
---
2. Make it possible to have any number of corps in an alliance.
---
3. Make it possible to blue anyone in the game.
---
4. Make it possible to control as much space you want or like to have
---
5. Make it possible to anchor a shit load of citadels in a system/grid with out any penalties
---
6. Make it possible to jump in an entire super/titan fleet with a single shit 300 LO cyno.
---
7. Make it possible for super/titans to hit sub caps.
---
8. and much much more

Intentionally being dumb or is it just natural.
---
They are underutilized because they, like all triglavian ships, are designed for small gang warfare and not for fleets. In their intended role they are quite strong.
---
Jump bridges definitely were based on standings, jump gates are based on acl
---
The exception of FRT was regarding the "old names of 2015", not RMT/Botting.
---
That does not help foster smaller groups. That penalizes less well-organized groups, which promotes larger groups. What helps foster smaller groups is easier logistics and movement, not harder.

Banderlogs are probably better than INIT if it was pure alliance vs alliance, but lets be real here, INIT would lose one fight and either roll back to Fountain or batphone the rest of Imperium in order to not lose face.
---
I like confusing people
---
evesterdam attendend here.. having sound issues. theyll start in about 15 minutes they said
---
Coalitions/Alliances are far better structured than BOB back then. 
---
If directors could even pull the plug on Mittani, they would just reorganize a new alliance the matter of hours. 
---
Also it doesn't make the entire "fortress delve" implode to lose sov after the alliance was shut down. Citadels are still just as much a pain to grind.     
---
The invader can just put up his own structures faster. (which helps but isn't the same as the debacle BOB faced).

Jump bridges were based on standings, Ansiblex are not. They use the new access lists that came with citadel.

There never was. By design. Unless you are the hegemon, you cannot be independent. And if you are the hegemon, then by definition you have the biggest blob.
---
You should talk to your dealer about getting enough for the rest of us.
---
thank you buddie
---
The new structures don't cause jump fatigue. 
---
You couldn't chain jump bridges the same way. You had to look carefully at which bridge to take so you wouldn't ramp up fatigue but cut the most gate jumps.
---
Unless you are talking of jump bridges before phoebe.
---
It took INIT. a 3-4 hours moveop to get from Fountain to the keepstar in lowsec last week.
---
That required pre-staging the day before the timer. Who benefits of torturing us more than 3 to 4 hours? We could have started 5 hours earlier. Or 3 days before. 
---
All it would have done is make it not worth it to even try. It didn't happen in the end, but making it a pain in the ass to ever leave home doesn't incite conflict.
---
The current state of Fatigue prevents power blocks to drop on an ongoing engagement across the entire star-cluster, but enables them to prepare a short offensive, that would otherwise never happen, and be back in a reasonable time if a counter offensive from the back was launched.     
---

Gila can easily run all T5s except dark (your drones can't hit anything in dark filaments). You just need to stop using passive tank fits (which I assume you are using since you have trouble running anything &gt;T3) and go active with some mild bling and boosters.
---
A Cerberus works well for Darks and Exotics and doesnt need a fit over 1b, even for T5s. You dont even need a crystal pod, just 5% damage and ROF hardwiring, and 3% application implants.
---
A Sacrilege excells in Electricals, but needs a girthy pod cause you're brawling instead of kiting, and it doesnt have the range bonuses a Cerb has.
---
A passive regen Gila is fantastic for Gamma-Rays, due to the shield HP buff and Triglavians (and some other NPCs) having a natural explosive resist plus the Gamma explosive resist.
---
Firestorms suck and I havent bothered to perfect a sub 1b ship that can reliably do T4s and T5s.

Volta lives in Thera, which is more NPC null than wormhole.
---
Yeah, this abrupt change must certainly be caused by conditions which have existed for several months and is definitely totally unrelated to the incoming April update. Definitely, I am absolutely sure of that.
---
How come they did it so shitty in the 1st place that you have to completely shut down the client for character switch ? I mean, even back when Eve launched character switchign was pretty much industry standard. EQ, AO, Dar Age of Crappalot, Just about every single game had it. 
---
I just got myself a 3d-printer as well, so maybe I will have those as well..
---
Sweet, I will check it out.
---
Yeah, it's so rare you actually want to change those overlay settings. 99% of the time you get that popup it's by mistake when you're after something else.
---
I would very highly recommend training into Trig ships if you haven't yet. Also, buy PLEX, there is only one direction its gonna go, don't invest too much into too many hulls and whatnot and don't hold onto ISK, these are major losers.
---
Say NO to Drugs! Dont Drug and Redditpost!

There's no big boy, that's a meme to make NullSec krabs live in fear and drink their kool-aid.
---
"You can't camp these gates bc auto killed" lmao
---
Honestly, wormhole space as a whole is more or less dead. No "wormhole superpowers" anymore, just small scavengers trying to fill the power vacuum left by Hard Knocks and Co
---
Art is really well done. 
---
Active Gila, blinged though, can do T5s electrical and fire very easy, the passive one is better suited for Gamma and Exotic. Sac can do Dark, Fire and Electrical, with different fits though, but avoid gamma and exotic in it. Phantasms and Zealots are good in electrical, I personally like the Phantasm much better.
---
Some people also use Ishtars and Vagabonds, I don't like either, not my thing, especially the Vagabond with its 4 mids just sucks for me.
---
Thanks for the comments guys I don't mind changing out of my gila to something else yes I'm running s purger build currently but just want to get higher tiers as I really like the content it's the only PvE I seem to enjoy
---
Active Gila, Sac and Vedmaks do very well in Fire, but not sub 1 bil.
---
show me on this doll where the supercapitals touched you
---
Yeah the point is to make it at or below 1b. I was thinking blasters but you lose a lot of time burning to the targets.
---
how does the Sacrilege do in dark t4-t5's?
---
Probably cause he's 1 of the mouth breathers with rorqs mining on those moons, if he has 3 brain cells he knows that said rorqs basically never die because idiots balanced them and he may not have even been around for dominion sov or for pos mining when, you know when people had to interact with structures far more to win.
---
Keepstars alone wouldn't have made the game like it is now, it's the fucking Xl citadels+injectors+rorquals combo that fucked everything imo
---
Doable but I prefer the Cerb. That missile range bonus is amazing, being able to shoot CN Scourge HAMs at 47km and kill off the repping frigs before the main body even gets to you... plus if you ever get the frigate spawn, steer them into the blue cloud and two shot em with CN ammo. If no blue cloud , it takes like 3-4 shots. 
---
Sac can get really fucked with missile range TDs
---
That's kinda my point though: you could have staged on the night and got there in one jump (but then have a cooldown before going home) or staged the night before and left the second you were done. You have options, and less time spent scouting, moving alts into position, etc. 
---
It's also (as far as I see it) a benefit to not have already entrenched entities with a home to defend have to balance home defence versus expansion/assault. Being able to have one fleet both for move-outs and base defence seems a little cheap, if you'll pardon the phrasing (can't think of a less offensive way to put it).
---
But I get your point. Maybe have some kind of diminishing returns so that jumps within [insert reasonable distance here] of your sov have one cooldown, and those further afield go the full 24 hours? Means you can still spend the same time as now on the op, just you only have to do a single jump and wait, if it's within a contestable range of your boundaries, but if you want to drop something way out of the way, you have to commit a fleet that you know can't come back for defence, meanwhile lowsec entities still get penalised for over-escalation.
---
Oh, and thanks for reading and responding, I know I'm a bit ramble-tastic, so that's a feat in itself. :)
---
Could you share your t5 dark cerb fit ?
---
Can confirm, HK still lives in WHs though, but from a C1, and they still evict any new up and coming WH corps, this past 2 weeks I've seen them evict a promising 5-5 corporation that was fielding 30 man fleets daily.
---
Probably a long shot but what the hay.
---
Would it be possible for you to make a trade route tool for EVE? For example one feature being looking up all the sales in one system and moving them to another.
---
EVE hasn't had one (at least a similar one) since EVE-Central went offline, and think its not coming back.
---
You might as well ask for auto-biomass on destruction of capital ships.
---
&lt;That's kinda my point though: you could have staged on the night and got there in one jump (but then have a cooldown before going home) or staged the night before and left the second you were done. You have options, and less time spent scouting, moving alts into position, etc.
---
do you mean jumping into battle right from the moveop?
---
We expected heavy TiDi and the OP to possibly last hours deep into the night (for Euros). I was fully prepared to do so, but i doubt i would have been after already having moved a couple of hours.     
---
What i meant was, that there was not much of a chance goons all of a sudden dropped their full titan fleets on the ongoing engagement, like it might have been the case pre-phoebe.
---
&gt;But I get your point. Maybe have some kind of diminishing returns so that jumps within [insert reasonable distance here] of your sov have one cooldown, and those further afield go the full 24 hours? Means you can still spend the same time as now on the op, just you only have to do a single jump and wait, if it's within a contestable range of your boundaries, but if you want to drop something way out of the way, you have to commit a fleet that you know can't come back for defence, meanwhile lowsec entities still get penalised for over-escalation.
---
Your suggestion gives the defender another gigantic advantage over any possible attacker, though. Don't we want the opposite?
---
This is a perfect example of why you should never trust a stranger.
---
Probably Lazerhawks, but nobody's making a big noise these days. The wormhole community as a whole is chastened by seeing how nullseccers can blob anyone if they decide to do so.
---
Nope. Blasters perform pretty horribly. Especially sub 1 Bil.Even with super bling they are by far the worst weapon platform for Abyss. Doing AByss in a Vigilant or Deimos is like riding a bicycle in Daytona 500 and trying to win. I mean you will eventually cross the finish line but ...

Superpowers make things stale.
---
Yeah, about that. I just started a job, after being out of work for nine months. I am not yet in the computer for my supervisor to assign my more permanent schedule. So for now, I am filling in random shifts to get my hours. Plus, I already have half a trillion ISK in the green on zkill, compared to roughly 2.4bil in the red. It's not like I haven't been doing pvp. Right now, my pvp pilot is sitting in a tengu, and is ten days from undocking and using a dread. I'm not some scrub that has never undocked in a fleet, or been afraid to 1v1 away from my "home" system. Several times I have intentionally, though unsuccessfully, tried to hunt down the likes of Olmeca Gold (don't say his name two more times, it summons him) when he has been doing his thing. My last pvp action was about two weeks ago, because I am taking a brief break while I get work situated.
---
Tdsin is the largest group by numbers. Lazerhawks haven't done anything spectacular in a while - they seem to be less activities than they were at their peak a year or so ago.
---
Inner hell has stepped up activities a lot more these days. 
---
Odin's call is pretty big and active as well.
---
But clearly Ronin ONE are bob's blessed these days. :P
---
what are you even talking about retard
---
injectors are not the problem, injectors make the problem appear much more fast. super/capital proliferation would have come 2 years later, but it would have come anyways
---
Eve had 60k pilots online back in 2007-2008.
---
To be honest, my original logic was that, within your space, you have the new gates: to encourage their use (build, fuel, defend), they mean 'fatigue free' jumping within your own area, which gives a bonus to defenders in terms of movement, but also requires them to invest in the infrastructure and have multiple more weak points to be attacked in order to get (and keep) this bonus. Having a lesser version of the bonus extend into next door neighbours' parts seems fair, if folk who actually live there think that (I'd be happy enough with not).
---
In terms of defenders getting there easier, yes, that would be the case. However, a) in the example above where it's a low sec system, that's outside sov, so won't get the benefit, and b) in any case, whilst the defender might have an easier time getting into the fight, surely that's better than a structure bash racing jump fatigue as a fleet moves in? That's where the fight actually happens, plus with being locked into the system, even if the structure goes down, the fight can continue rather than the defender (or attacker) running off. More big fights, less shooting at silent brick walls.
---
I would also argue that the example given of the keepstar in lowsec would probably not even exist. Why do you have a keepstar there? To house capitals? But if it's not worth the bother of getting the capitals in/out of the system, there's no need for capitals there, and thus a smaller structure can be used (or if they decide to go for the KS for e-peen value, it'll probably still be defended by subcaps and thus can be attacked by subcaps).
---
Please delete yourself in game 
---
I'm always happy to see more Eve video creators.
---
 I look at all the posts about nullsec problems and realize I don't have to deal with this because I'm a wormholer.

 Ahhhh relief from getting stressed out about super umbrellas, not being forced to worry about some super coalition coming to get you, and not caring about dumb ansiblex whatever mechanics.

I Just get small gang fights all the time and whep wonderfully to them lol.

Yeah, I got burned out from Eve after about 2 years of playing pretty much daily, but it was mostly because I did not have a goal to work toward. I hope I come back eventually, I just hope the company does not fuck it up by then.
---
to bad i cant understand it.

What Evewars? The content fights you mean?
---
I'm on the opposite side of the spectrum, just started a few weeks ago having a good time so far.
---
How do you know some of the 11 aren't multiboxing as well? I agree, it's 4 v 11.
---
They just needed one or two more people to reship and come back, looks like you were out of cap boosters?
---
Nice fight though.
---
I need a Loki background to celebrate my first T3C before it gets nerfed to hell

Injectors and Plex allow him to have those supers. Without it. The Keepstar is a non factor
---
Not bad. made in three parts and glued right?   
---
looks like a print that would take some hours ;-)

is it printed in PLA? And did he just use exported 3D figure from the game? I could be tempted to throw a model on my 3D printer too and see how it turns out :D

I have printed a stratios before in small version that turned out alright. But not something bigger yet.

I recently toyed with the idea of making room for a magnet inside the print and do a mag-lev stand so I had a spaceship that levitated. But haven't had time to do it. (Master thesis eats time like no tomorrow) ;-)

Ouch still a bit salty it appears 
---
That's good to hear, I would definitely suggest finding a corp with people you enjoy being around and also setting some short and long-term goals. I noticed after a while, isk just stops mattering in a way, especially if you don't have it going toward something.

Not sure if the Mutaplasmid for Damage Control was a joke or serious.
---
I got some friends to bounce around with, we got plans for what the money is for.
---
hmm maybe, but I need to understand your need first, what are you saying by  "For example one feature being looking up all the sales in one system and moving them to another. "
---
looking for price difference between multiple system? can you specify your thought I am not sure to understand right
---
That whole thing is such an unnecessary addition. Not sure why it even has an on/off switch, since it doesn't turn anything off.
---
It is , because even with one character to move them you can easily produce endless supply of those ships.
---
Scarcity of resources creates competition, competition creates conflict, conflict creates drama, and drama ensures conflict becomes self sustaining. EVE is driven by conflict. Even acknowledging CCP's increasingly frustrating tactical game design decisions in recent years that make it HARDER to fight each other (timezone tanking with citadels+sov is a great example), the desire by large entities to WANT to fight each other doesn't exist because it is irrational for them to do so from a leadership perspective. Now that they all have their own established spheres of influence again, tacit cooperation interrupted by overhyped content wars is what the future looks like.
---
If you ever really want to rejuvenate EVE, you will need a major game re-design that fundamentally changes the political meta and the calculations leaders make about their relationships with others. 
---
Frankly, there is too much space in this game with the declining player count. My recommendation is to delete half the nullsec systems outright while introducing dynamism to desirable resources like moons and system truesec values that shift geographically over time ("depletion"). CCP needs to ensure that the new, smaller nullsec geography makes sense for 2019 jump ranges through a handcrafted rehaul of the EVE map. Shifting resouces with less to go around forces players to fight and create diplomatic drama instead of sitting static in their fortresses like Delve.
---
This would be a massive disruption to the status quo and a big inconvenience for players at its onset.
---
But it is 100% plausible to design a revamp like this in EVE and then implement an orderly process to make it happen without punishing players during the transition. It would only take boldness, money, and dev time from CCP.
---
Will it happen? No obviously not. 
---
CCP views EVE Online as rental income at this point--x amount of dollars per year pretty much guaranteed with minimal work since the game is effectively already finished. Major disruptions that could drive away large amounts of players like removing level 4s from highsec or deleting half of nullsec space is a threat to their income's bottom line. A revamp like this probably wont lead to a large influx of new players to EVE online or a massive return of bittervets who have moved on with their real lives. 
---
A radical re-design would absolutely benefit the current player base dedicated to EVE online, but it could also risk shrinking that same player base. CCP and the major coalition are all obeying the same, rational rule:  
---
If it ain't broke, dont fix it.
---
I'm not sure why you think it will take 14 days to move a fleet by taking gates. Clearly you have never moved a Supercapital fleet by gates (I have). Once you get past the first jump, it's actually currently possible to move a Supercapital fleet about as fast via gates as it is via jump drive - you just have to make a fitting choice to make that possible (and of course you run the risk of actually getting a fight. Oh, the horror! The horror!). The first jump is the fast one, after that fatigue slows you down just enough to make taking gates an attractive option. Of course, it's that first jump that also lets the Supercapital umbrella exist. It's that first jump that makes it easy to save Rorquals. It's that first jump that lets you drop a Nyx on a solo cruiser. The first jump is one of the problems with Supercapitals.
---
Goddamn beautiful! 
---
I would love to see the orthrus done in this style. 
---
lmao
---
And I am someone who got doomsdayed a while ago at a hostile ansiblex . Still see no problem with that. At least it has to be gunned. POS JB had guns that shot without human intervention.
---
It's not a stargate that you can camp. It's the replacement for jump bridges and belong to players. Be glad the Ansiblex itself is not gunned.
---
Although I agree it could be reinforced a bit faster.

I think I was in their C1 the other day. They had 2 rorqs out mining. I was only in an Astero so I couldn't do anything.

So it turns out we're both right. It was not possible to receive reps with triage on, but repair amount with triage off was not insignificant like it is with faxes. And fits could be changed on the fly since there was no restriction on refitting with an aggression timer.

Also the jump tunnel animations, the nebula will change if you're jumping cross-region etc.

&gt;First, remove the insane bonus to warp core strength. 
---
HAHAHAHAHAH no.  one of the appeals is that a single interceptor can't hold them down, you need either alot of ships or a specialized ship.    
---
&gt; Second, double-down on the NSA changes
---
keep in mind CCP wants people to ACTUALLY PLAY THE SHIPS.  not make them so gimped that they dont get used.   the NSA change is already a major fitting change, specially for shield caps.  and even has impacts in PvP.   so its fine as is.
---
adding more wieght to it would drive people off playing caps. and thus hurt CCP.
---
&gt;Third, simultaneously nerf and buff jump drives on Supercapital ships.
---
....the stupidity in this....is so fucking idiotic, my brain is actively trying to kill itself to forget reading it.   once a year? god i hope this post is a troll post...cause if your serious....
---
try traveling from Delve to Gemi in nullsec by gate.  and then, because of gate camps. you have to go in convoys.  so that means maybe 1-2 ops a day.   the total hours it would take...would fuck over the movement of super caps.   might as well buy a new one at the destination.

Absolutely, though I admit I did get a more expensive house than I prefer to put my kids in a great school district.

FRT is not independent, they are aligned with the North. They didn't come out of nowhere, most of them were null powers on Serenity. GalMil is loosely aligned with Goons.

So everything is okay and having only two options when you want to join null as a new entity is utterly fine. OMG.

Didn't want to be that guy, but there already is a T2 trig ship in-game...   \^_^

Muta's for damage controls though? That's a strange one.

Most likely not, it was a tech demo, not a showcase for a new game.

40-45k players online with the average char-to-player ratio about 1.7 
---
Now it's 30k players online with the average ratio over 2 due to botting.

Lowsec and NPC null being a wasteland.
---
All is fine. Nothing to worry about.
---
Honestly the best way if you're only interested in isk. The isk a new player makes in an hour grinding is laughable at best, where an hour of work can easily equate to billions of isk.  
---
It's sort of a trade off of "Do I mind spending hours of my life grinding for cents, or do an hour of physical labor in real life to actually play the game".  
---
Each to their own I guess, and to answer the question - if you're not in a null sec alliance I would look in to that. From there you can go and do some AFK ratting in a Vexor Navy Issue.
---
Something something "streets ahead."

Very cool!   Painting it should be fun....

Erm.
---
If you think the only way to play EVE is to mine moons in your rorq indefinitely then I understand why people like you prefer the way EVE is now.
---
Passive income tied with the distribution of minerals means there was an actual reason to fight over those moons. There is no reason for anyone to bother to fight for the moon 20 systems away if you can get only marginally worse moon in the very same system you live in.
---
 Honestly the best way if you're only interested in isk. The isk a new player makes in an hour grinding is laughable at best, where as an hour of work in real life can easily equate to billions of isk.

(might be wrong tho)
---
all out
---
Ah yes, players literally leaving the game in droves because it became nearly impossible to find consistent fights was the best thing to happen to EVE.
---
My how times change. Soon enough not only will people have forgotten about Monoclegate and Why We Hated WiS but they will have forgotten how bad the first iteration of fatigue was. They will have decided that actually citadel timers are awesome and perfectly balanced. And most shockingly, they will have determined that actually entosis was always the most enjoyable mechanic in EVE.

It takes some time to set up properly but you only have to reset your extractors every day (less if you want) and do pickup of items every now and again. It takes a little getting used to but it's the most passive(ish) thing I've found. 
---
Levis were a mistake you must accept the duel tanked rusty rod into your heart.

VEDHAC HYPE
---
Just asking, question was flair based.
---
:/
---
that should have it own reddit thread tbh :D
---
&gt;  with so many injected pilots we will not see this again
---
I've got 2 ssupercarriers alts, 2 titan alts, 1 apostle alt and none were injected, this game is fucking old and now everyone aim for big ship since they all already train the ssmaller one
---
Specifically, hisec ICE mining in an Orca, as these ice blocks are huge and don't deplete quickly. Plus, the profit is higher.
---
bollocks
---
I’m brand new to this game and the fact that anyone both has the funds for this ship
---
And can afford to lose it blow my mind. 
---
what? i never said that.
---
I never said that either. 
---
Thanks CCP for these or whoever it is that makes them. Definitely adds some immersion
---
With a caracal you can do t2s if you wanted
---
Very very cool. Well done. I've always enjoyed the app but this is even better.
---
Can I have a force recon first please?
---
VNI ratting forsaken hubs in sov null.
---
Thanks for this, wonder if there is going to be other keynotes at the other events or if this was our actual keynote that we would have gotten at the normal fanfest.
---
Really cool what they are doing for Katia Sae though
---
You ll get there... Just dont expect it to happen within days. Or weeks... Or even months. Except you throw a small cars worth in RL-cash on the table for injectors and stuff ;)
---
Vedhac confirmed
---
Oh yeah Im little bit on safe side, low missile skills atm
---
That monument is fantastic. Nicely done CCP.
---
Ayyyyyyy
---
It's true.
---
I used this flex seal to tie this scrap metal together. Now it's a naglfar
---
Play the game you want to play. 
---
The Eve I play now is nothing at all like the Eve I played when first getting into the game. 
---
It’s ok to change it up. If you want to accumulate, go ahead and mine/krab.  If that is dull, do something else....or do them both.  Just keep in mind the amount of ISK you need to play your game and have some way to generate it (or buy PLEX from CCP).  
---
If I could offer any advice though, it would be not to do anything in Eve that you don’t enjoy.  To accumulate ISK/Ore and not have fun with the process is a set up for burn out in my option. 
---
In any case...have fun and see you on fleets!
---
It watches your pr0n! /o\\
---
erebus too
---
they said they left some stuff for the other locations
---
The confessor pilot is just bad then.
---
armor and shield buses was a thing in x47
---
The profitability is in the gape between buying the plex, and selling the skill injectors. 
---
you compare the prices between months.
---
The moment when you realize that he went isk positive in that fight.
---
Mind=Blown 
---
That's a funny thing to say. I'm not sure Tri has a choice on this front these days. See previous Tri lowsec vs "all of eve™" supercap smackdown
---
I might start calling people Nergal
---
Its the same in highsec.
---
After getting ganked, so many miners with 10 year old characters will say "well I am only mining for now. Soon I will be out in Nullsec!"
---
you can do 3s in a caracal worth about 30mil...
---
always funny doing this and entering the pvp arena at the end.  sometimes you get a combatant sometimes you dont.  if you dont free loot if you do you can sometimes kite them and make them pay out if they have a super expensive ship
---
Moracha :-)
---
Thank you!
---
The Scope is definitely a CCP production! I think CCP Loki's the main force behind them. The Discourse is a player-created Scope-a-like. :3
---
well asset safety is better than station flipping was I mean you used to just shoot until you owned the null station and then nothing happened but you now owned the station. At least with asset safety that's 10% of the value of everything stored in the structure that gets charged to the players the lost the structure.
---
CCPls can they not be OP as hell like most of the existing Triglavian ships.
---
Are you retarded?
---
I'm not really sure what your point is there. Yes, wormhole space is fun to play in because of the things you said, and nullsec would be a lot more fun if it were possible to roam for small gang content without supers being dropped on you, uncounterable cynos and local (which you forgot to say).
---
I will say this - just think about how bad prices for minerals would be without keepstars.
---
I think it needs a few changes.
---
One - increase plex cost of skill extractors.
---
Two - make them less efficient.  Let the diminishing returns hit far quicker.
---
Three - give diminishing returns also after more than "x" number used in a week.
---
https://eve-tracker.org/whkills
---
I'm pretty sure this is a bigger buff for Erebus/Avatars. They can receive decent reps on a half-assed shield tank more reliably/safely than a Ragnarok getting reps on a half-assed armor tank.
---
For fun in X47 I tested my Hel and reached I think it was 84m EHP with heat.
---
I am sure supers having even more EHP is just what we need.  Komodo, Wyvern, or Leviathan would put my Hel's EHP to shame.
---
Exactly my complaint with the game as well and why I lost all interest in it. Carriers are now just another ship, and so are supers. People throw them down and other stuff like its nothing, it is annoying to know that what you kill now has no value is no fun apart from the fact that your notorious plan worked and that sound when the target goes down and the killmail popped up.
---
Massive buffs for Shield Capital Fleets.....  
---
Shield HP implants and buffed rechargers.
---
I stopped doing pve year ago. I just can't stand grinding. I relied on skill farm and some market trading for isk. I only get on when I see ping for fleet or if buddies need helps. 
---
yeah I saw there might be a dread or HAC soon. More and more people are getting into the Triglavian ships now, and since I have a massive influx of ISK, getting the skillbooks won't be a hurdle like it was in the past. No excuses! 
---
I like the implant changes. Maybe my wasted 5mil LP in blood raiders can be turned in for something useful now...RIP the dream of the chemosh bpc being available like the vehement 
---
It doesn't say which summer the shield slaves will be complete.
---
Capsuleers, don't give shit to concord, bloody twats.
---
calling it now p-drakes unironically becomes the meta 
---
That would be me. What can I do you for? 
---
I'm all for celebrating player achievements, but Katia got more screentime than things we hadn't previously seen. I'd like that 2 hours of my life back thanks.
---
&gt;I might start calling people Nergal
---
Nergal please.
---
Didn't realise Chaos gods were getting added to EVE. 
---
i dont give a shit about lore. So the fact that slaves which everyone is usta being armor will now be shield is gonna annoy me. they should just keep slaves as armor and create a name for shield 
---

---
Or which decade
---
And to think, literally yesterday I saw people lamenting "the CCP who made monuments just for people playing the game".
---
Not wanna disparage DU, as it looks like a game I'd play. However "30000 **simulated** players" sounds like bs, I just can't put my finger on it.
---
I just wish they'd advertise with actual achievements, instead of pulling a No Man's Sky.
---
It's not balanced correctly and major null blocks get the most benefit out of it with alts. Considering there is a balance pass on anything faucet,sink and income/production related it only makes sense. Sorry the concept of balance offends you and hurts your pocket
---
Sorry to develop on you like that. Get developed on
---
Ah, unassailable humor...

when people said HK was unevictable, it was meant as no other WH group could evict them. If you lag the system with 1500 retards, then yes, anything is possible. 
---
Normally I would write the system out in a text box. Like U-Q, highlight, right click, search system and click the one I needed. Even that feature doesn't work anymore. It requires 3 letters and the tack no longer is considered part of that

In order for this to make sense, you need to be a retarded nullbear who can't fathom living without set systems surrounding their home, with afk intel botters keeping them notified of all the traffic coming in.

Are they? After pospy got evicted, and bbtic fled to lowsec, who does ronin one sleep under now? 
---
Seconding the fact that Noraus has had CCP action against him due to RMT. 
---
They already have one
---
Too bad nobody cares about how you feel, kapow
---
Yes, they confirmed ages ago Trigs are an entirely new race and not a pirate faction. 
---
How much loot do they normally have?
---
Instead, catapult capitals.
---
- Entering siege makes it capable of throwing huge veldspar rocks at huge range.
---
- Rocks have low velocity but high aoe damage.
---
- Rocks can be mined on the fly, giving mwd-speed exploration frigates a new role in combat.
---
... It turns off your sensor overlay. I'm in agreement that it's useless 99% of the time, but the on/off switch does actually turn it on and off.

their tank is that they require a duel invite to be shot

CCP finally decided to delete C4 Space
---
Null should be like w-space. No asset safety. Loot fairy gets to zap shit.
---
This whole scenario sounds like a pve confessor found in a C13 by an exploring astero. The confessor would need to warp out to his mobile depot to refit a point, so technically he isnt bad.
---
Well, depending on the value of all those abyssal mods, he might not have gone ISK positive...
---
Shield Slaves still incoming. yay!
---
.....an implant set for drone dmg.......as a rattlesnake pilot....this is gonna be appealing.
---
That thing wasn't for a CCP project. It's from haedan to work on their projects. CCP provided the ingame assets and hopes to benefit from haedens work long term.
---
I got sucked into the krab lifestyle when my last alliance went from FW LS to full on NS living. The money from the moon mining was really good, however the lifestyle and priorities was awful. Eve was no longer a fun game, it was more of a wealth build up simulator that took up too much time. 
---
There is no point in amassing ISK/assets in Eve if you’re not going to use them!!! You don’t remember/reminisce on the stuff you had but the experiences! 
---
But... Then all the drama and "giggedygiggedy allready replaced" would be lost... Dont bring logic into this!

---
Who uses accurate flair here? 
---
Why can’t CCP just delete all existing supercaps from everyone’s accounts - problem solved. 
---
Honestly, don't try to plex, it will make this game a terrible chore.  Why not get a refillable debit card?  They don't need to be linked to your bank account.  If you save up for a while while play in as an alpha, buy your plex during the next sale, you can do 3-6 months all at once.
---
As far as ship fits, I'm pretty against the WCS in the lows, they kill your lock time meaning more time on grid more time to be scanned down.  Fit nanofiber and or initial stabilizers to reduce your align time.  Keep d-scanning and be ready to flee before another ship lands on you.  
---
Who would get a ship blow it up just for a couple mil....when you can just get a ship, and go get dank rat ticks. That literally makes zero sense....hell VNI ratting probably even takes less effort than Insurance Fraud...you don't even need to press any buttons.

I also recently wrote a guide based off the low-effort way I do PI, which only requires check-in/flying around every 3-4 days.

Wow that monument is bad ass.

No way will they release it without tweaking some numbers... right?

i think they said they were going to adjust base shield hp/shield extenders on capitals so that they are a less dramatic boost than just adding them in cold turkey

I think jumping once a year is stupid, but I think it’s an interesting idea, especially if it was toned down to say, once a week, I think it would be a really good idea and add a lot of depth. I don’t see what’s wrong with having a single interceptor tackle a titan, it makes them more like glass cannons, and means that you have to have a proper support fleet to use them.
---
it takes a 3b ship+pod but its fine. But you need virtually perfect missile skills as you can tank everything fine but killing shit in time is a bit of a stretch

Ah, ok that makes more sense. My bad

There are real conflicts in the game, you people just don't want that. If you did you wouldnt join a bloc that literally cannot and does not allow itself to have a real conflict.
---
Ailok the game mechanics are only half the problem. The other half is the players. You should know this first hand, you left a small group to join the blob. Every player that does this adds to the problem and you won't fix the problem by just changing game mechanics.
---
It is easy to blame game mechanics, and they do contribute a large amount to the problem, but the core problem is that people are lazy and inherently want security and content at the same time while not having to do much actual work for it and that isnt possible unless you join a large bloc.
---
People have to be willing to work for success. Not just the CEO, not just the FCs, but the entire corp, all members. Unless that happens no matter the game mechanics, the corp members will whine its too hard and you'll all just join a bloc.
---
At this point the game has polarized so much in this way that growing an alliance to competitive status takes literally 6 to 12 months plus minimum. People do not have the patience for that. Large groups jump on ever small conflict there is because they have nothing better to do and ruin that content. One group batphones which makes the other group forced to batphone and good small conflicts just end up making content for shitty large blocs that cant be bothered to go fight someone their own size.
---
Everyone that complains about this shit ironically sits in a big bloc. You want to be apart of the solution? Don't do that.
---
The problem is human nature and you can't fix human nature.

Used the app is really good is this browser one a new edition

The Rambo shipped faulty, which made a cascade of other problems from blowing the hot end heater, the filament sensor, the extruder motor. All the while trying to get customer service to give a crap about me. I got the printer in January, it took until March to get the printer fully functioning again because they would only send me the parts they thought I needed and only one at a time until they finally sent me a new Rambo. It was not unusual for them to say they would get back to me in 24 hours but I would wait 3 days with no response before angrily contacting them again. If the printer didn't have the speed, accuracy and features it does I would have demanded a refund and given up on prusa.

In the same field, the popup over items that gives you the skills needed and offers to directly insert it into the skill queue.  0% of the time do I want that tooltip, and it blocks me from doing what I want about 99% of the time.

You say this like it's a bad thing? Armor cap fleets have had their implants for a long while now and it's not as though there are many shield cap fleets to begin with due to the aforementioned armor implants.

Yeah it's pretty terrible to have a good BS brawl. Maybe FRT can lend us some of their bots so we can afk grind to get supers again lmao

Yeah I got that, thing is, in my experience at least back in the day (2014-2016 for me) whenEVER CCP made changes, it was usually for the worse although they always think they're making things better.

Why exactly? Deets please.

The n+1 problem in EvE is analogous to first-past-the-post-voting IRL. It kills diversity since banding together and having more people is always the solution. Therefore both always trend towards a two party system/eliminating diversity and consolidating power.

Ok..if the old EFT fitter still a thing? Used that more than pyfa.

Honestly, I feel like it's a little... Ostentatious? Idk. But it reminds me more of handsome jack pragmatism than of intrepid exploration. I still think they should have named probes after her, but it's cool just to see them recognizing the community.

Its natural for players to congregate into large entities. This will occur no matter what.  Why fight it?

Im not familiar how pvp abyssals work? My cara fit is same that PocketDK uses in his youtube abyssal guide video.

So far ive been lucky with frigate bps and skill books and t1s are breeze so thats why im sticking with them.

“Armor HACs” (Zealots using Scorch crystals) have a decent optimal range and kiting ability, but once you start using lasers in falloff range the damage drops off really quickly. The FC started to call primaries in the falloff range which made Shadoo have a stroke.

Not the first time null folks go balls deep into wh space, your experience just had more publicity.

if I get a Väinämöinen-spaceship I will come back to playing Eve.
---
The lower the security status of the system the better the spawns in that system can be. On average you will find more/better loot in -1.0 than -0.1.
---
The BigMack doctrine will rise just you wait
---
Null sec is all the same from a legal perspective. But that negative number rating factors into other mechanics behind the scenes. Things like how many and how powerful the rat spawns will be. Or how effective certain Sov mechanics can get. Stuff like that.
---
I don't even know what you plan on doing with it. Read the dev blog first. https://www.eveonline.com/article/rebalancing-strategic-cruisers

Ah great, thank you!

Aha excellent, yeah that rings a bell that I'd read that somewhere ages ago. Thanks.

airdisc? is that you?

Great  PI guide.
---
But am I really that Spod-brainwashed to look at \[isk\]/ \[real time invested (hour)\] and just don't even bother if its well below 500M-1B isk/hour? I feel like making money has sucked the soul out of me and Eve. Nothing is the same anymore and I even start to wonder why people even bother with PI in the first place.
---
Keep in mind for exploration it doesn't make as big of a difference as it does for other PVE activities like ratting and mining. RNG will be a much more significant swing factor than sec status in null.
---
Lmao NJED isn’t on there because it still has ABA listed. We left ABA like... 6 months ago. Any idea who I can talk to about getting that changed?
---
Normally, I'd agree with you, but Veritas was the one who said it. Before he left CCP, he was famous (or in one case, infamous) for doing things with EVE code that should have been impossible.
---
It would not surprise me to learn that his infamous instanced PvP code that he intended for tournament play was repurposed into Abyssal PvP.

Sorry to give you this disappointing response.... No.

That never stops being funny.

erm French connexion a goon pet? off base there. they were given a constellation as part of a long term agreement by Noraus (fraternity) who then immediately welched on his agreement (as he does) immediately after he found out said constellation had the top 5 moons in Detorid and made up some bs story about French connexion relaying opsec to some made up boogeyman enemy. How they were able to obtain this super secret, game changing information, that apparently had no effect on anyone while being neutral, not ever in fleets, not ever in comms, not Chinese, and completely uninvolved in winterco is beyond me. Maybe they're that good.
---
well not one particular thing. I used Tengus for all sorts of things...null and wh pve and pvp. Data and relic sites sometimes, almost anything you can imagine. I basically I had collected or designed Tengu fits that sort of made it a great Swiss Army knife swapping configs with a depot.

"Silent Coalition" or "SiCo" is, in essence, a loosely-allied group of corps designed to bring a bunch of noobs, turbokrabs, and unskilled players together so they can easily be farmed by leadership alts. Check out the kill board for "seadc", their "entry" corp. It's pretty bad.

After my corp joined the "group", I was talking to leadership, complaining about embarrassing losses on zkill, and it was explained to me that people in EVE were already autopiloting valuable gankable freighters around, flying deadspace pve rattlesnakes into wardec ops, etc. So why not bring as many of them as possible into one place and one comms where you can just ask them where they're going, and what they're moving, and if they're at keyboard? Or, more often, they just volunteer that info without being asked.
---
Their method is basically just to throw as many recruitment mails out as possible, shotgun style, claiming all of the advantages of citadels, etc,  with none of the wardec risk in highsec because of "careful manipulation of game mechanics" or some such, and offer "paths to null/wh etc". Obviously that appeals to a very particular kind of player. Competent (or semi-competent, in my case) players mostly leave, and, based on my experience, feel the need to take a shower after.
---
I was the Jaguar pilot and 1 of the scythe pilots in this fight, honestly we really thought you were bait tanking and debated on disengaging much earlier in the fight, Was still a fun little fight either way =\]
---
You mean those studio backed , funded and published AAA Mmo releases?
---
Why did they offer something that an indy company of bedroom coders with little investment, who's "Servers" were just desktops at launch didnt?
---
Hmmm?
---
The tengu is still a good solo ship, I fly mine regularly for hunting. It is also still great for PvE as well. Strats will now have a more difficult time fighting any T3 1v1, though it is still doable you are more heavily reliant on your opponent having a poor fit, they still work for exploration for the most part.
---
It was a kit. It all went back to the faulty Rambo. Changing it out solved all my problems. 
---
Damn I had typed a reply but something when wrong..let me sum up.
---
I had configs for almost any role you can imagine and would field swap using a mobile depot. Like cloaky null to travel then switch to a combat config when I land someplace interesting.
---
Thanks for the link. 
---
You're dumb lol
---
And his 3b pod: https://zkillboard.com/kill/75839542/
---
We already get this to an extent with suprcarrier burst weapons. It's just that the cap version of EWAR is not anti-cap EWAR or more effective EWAR, but AOE EWAR. 
---
Hello and welcome to EVE Online!
---
You will find EVE Online to be easy to get to know, a tad harder to master.
---
The people are friendly and sociable, it’s always been this way :-).
---
Never be afraid to reach out to people if you need a helping hand. There are people who will help you navigate to your very own spot in what we call ‘null-sec’ [0.0] security space, for a nominal fee. Contact anyone in Goonswarm, they have an impeccable reputation within the game.
---
Welcome to EVE Online. It’s amazingly like any other MMO out there, except for those parts where it isn’t!
---
This makes me happy :)
---
KK hunting anything in particular? Explorers? Miners?
---
Also that's interesting that comment about T3vT3.
---
I was just watching a vid of a close fit between a Tengu and Legion, not sure if was pre-change or post though I'll have to go back and look.
---
Good fight! Tengu won by the way.
---
Oo does that mean we get trig logi?
---
For me new jump portal effects are the coolest stuff :O
---
The assets came from eve online and Valkyrie iirc.
---
Usually it's because someone either dumped a bunch of the higher yield ore on the market dropping the price, or bought out a significant amount of the lower yield ore, raising the price.
---
Unfortunately the days of 1100 dps HAMgus with BS level tanks are over
---
they killed his ship once so clearly they are OP
---
they were listed as TBD
---
Yeah.. I Have no clue what ya just said.
---
Short answer: no, that is reasonable... for your circumstances.  
---
Long answer: Frankly, it depends on the player and their alliance. If you have a safe spot to sit (and the ISK/skills to invest) doing super ratting or Rorq mining, then making an extra 50m ISK a day is chump change. If your area of space occasionally tends to be camped, you don't have a massive super umbrella, your alliance doesn't own space in null, or you don't feel like subbing multiple characters, PI is an excellent source of supplementary income for the small effort you put in. Heck, putting in an hour or less of work every 3 days gets someone (with very little SP/ISK investment) the equivalent of an hour of VNI ratting every day for each toon they do PI with... and they don't need to sit out (potentially getting shot) in a VNI to get it. Most of the time they'll be in station/logged off, and the rare time they do venture out, they just pop from one POCO to the next in their epithal. Until PLEX prices went coco-bananas, I pretty much maintained my sub with just the PI I made on that account.
---
Additionally, some people don't have logistics support where they can easily import PI from trade hubs to build structures, T2 modules and ships, and other cool stuff. If you're part of a mega-bloc, this is NBD, but that is not the universal case.
---
Gf man! It was a good ending to my whiskey roam so I gotta give you props for the fun. 
---
*insert obligatory wish for one more sexy logi pilot*
---
I also wanted so bad a Trig marauder, probably they will add it in next set of ships (hopefully it wont be blackops). 
---
But also is hard to think about it. Will it have bastion or maybe other type of ability (like extreme resisstances all aroud but cant fit invus, and gun without spool time or cery short one?
---
Yeah I had a HAMgu fit or two but don't remember the DPS.
---
Hey thanks so much. I was playing for a good 30-45 min and I loved it. I did ask for help in game and the other players where so helpful.  I was just reading another post about the whole " 'null-sec' [0.0]" thing and it was a bit confusing. It seems like this is the type of game that I need to do research as I play.
---
I've looked around a bit but I can't find anywhere the exact targeting priority of Auto-targetting missiles. I've heard that they can target people in your own fleet, but I've also heard they only fire on targets that have previously fired on you.
---
Are they safe to use for ratting (even if someone jumps in on you)?
---
## without a tank and cyno is shameful
---
jesus christ that's sad
---
It's retarded. 
---
No.
---
I saw this and thought "oh it wasn't just Pitts that thought that's how we were gonna get the new capitals." Then I saw it was Pitts... Poor guy
---
Tengu is great. It ALMOST has enough scanres to lock a battlecruiser before it warps.
---
We already have t1 and 2 logi for trigs
---
Well, now you can even swap out the rigs, and carry more subsystems with you.
---
Armor titans were already dual tanked back in b-r and probably even before that
---
What a Poor's fit. I expected more out of the most risk aversive group in the game 
---
Yeah I noticed about the rigs and carrying the swap configs did create a cargo space problem before.
---
Because?
---
&gt; It seems like this is the type of game that I need to do research as I play.
---
You know, I think that might actually benefit you with regards to a couple of nuances here and there where it comes to EVE Online. It’s an older game now, it has a bit of history. There are a few established ideas.
---
Also, it is an ever-evolving universe. Things that were [like this] 2 years ago, now turn out to be [like that]. It’s a difference, the difference is important.
---
In as far as you’re not made aware of this yet, there is a useful bit of information that you really do need to be aware of: your ship will be blown up at some point. This is not an ‘maybe it will’ thing, it’s a given. Somebody will shoot your ship, you will lose it. In this context it is important to understand that you don’t get the ship back. It’s gone. Everything on it is gone. Everything in it is gone. Count on it happening.
---
When that happens [not: ‘*if*’ it happens], what you don’t want to do is to complain about it. You will likely find it a huge inconvenience and more than a little bit annoying. You will take it in stride. The -only- thing you can do is to get another ship and carry on.
---
It is also not a matter of a new player versus an older player. *Everybody’s* ship gets blown up at some point. That’s what happens there. It is part of the natural progression in New Eden. At some point your boat goes *pop*.
---
If you accept that happening and you can live with that idea, and you’re going to have to, I say what I say to anyone who is crazy enough to join that place:
---
Welcome to EVE!
---
And people say there´s no justice in the world
---
This happens to me all the time cause my PC is a piece of shit, nice work! 
---
Cruisers to be exact. And all trig ships have Armor Remote Repair Hull Boni.
---
Yeah, the first time I saw a diamond guy guristas warped a fleet in onto me with tackle frigates and battleships seconds later. 
---
The implants will be renamed like el_smuff said, then they will be removed from Sansha and added to Blood Raider drops/LP store, with the new shield slaves being added to the Sansha LP store.
---
Supercapitals are people too.
---
Thanks for showing you care. 
---
Waaaaat
---
Oh Lord Odin, LMFAO thanks so much for the warning because I would have flip my shit if I freaking lost my ship hahaha. Yeah that's fine.. It is a game after all. I try playing the game sometime back in 07 but my PC at the time wasn't good for it.. finally by 2009 I was able to play a little to the point of the character creation. A night or 2 ago I finally updated the game and early today I was in space.
---
eagle fleets will break 200k
---
Wow, that pilot gets a statue. I’m cheering and envious. I really should do my own unique thing first [no idea what it would be].
---
And she also lost no ships doing that. Amazing!
---
Wonderful video as always. The Scope is a phenomenal asset.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Make me thinking about agile capitals:
---
- move like battleships or something around that
---
- or maybe MJD bonus
---
- low hp for cap ship
---
- subcap capable weaponry
---
Not enough neutral logi, smh
---
at some point in the next year, the big boy in wh space will probably be part of a PGL fleet.
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75841717/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75841717/) 
---
Can you give some examples for a newish person? 
---
&gt; I would have flip my shit if I freaking lost my ship hahaha
---
A surprising amount of people simply *cannot* hack the idea of losing their ship and not getting it back. It’s how you know someone will be leaving soon and never come back and who will say “Well. that sucks. Give me another.” Those are the stayers.
---
It’s not communicated all that powerfully, although there is a training mission in which you *will* lose your ship. It’s like a Kobayashi Maru scenario. It is designed to teach you that this will happen to you and the only thing that can be done about it is to get a new ship.
---
Make all your big mistakes now. Now it’s affordable. Losing 25 million ISK may seem like a lot, before long you’ll consider it pocket lint.
---
Whatever you do: **YOU** decide what you do in EVE. If you are ever approached by an entity called CODE and they ask you to pay for a license, ask them if their dick can touch their ass and if they respond in the affirmative, tell them to go fuck themselves.
---
If you want to say someone’s idea is stupid, you generally need to provide a reason.
---
It's too retarded to deserve a response.
---
Ya one more Scythe and I would have been so fucked!
---
Next on “constructive internet conversations”.....
---
Plenty of good answers in this thread. To add to it check out this link and look for the section on TrueSec:
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/System_security
---
How long have you been a mawd for ? 
---
More importantly, will you use these new found powers for good or evil ?
---
Tengu is ok.. Get a loki. Does everything the tengu does but better now. Thy over buffed it, Its the king t3 now unseating the tengu after rebalance. Its a shame really. They killed the proteus and legion off, legion to a lesser extent but still no fucking drone bay for lasers like wtf ccp.. Anyways.. 
---
In short tengus ok but not as good as it once was loki is the better option.
---
Exactly my point.
---
You can't constructively respond to something as retarded as OPs ideas anymore then you can constructively respond to a pool of drool on the floor.
---
I think New Eden is implied, agreed with the rest.
---
Nergal Farage, for an exit of the Ammatar Mandate.

The relevant expansion came out on 4th November 2014 , how is a map from one and a half years later relevant?
---
K thanks!
---
FW, Factional Warfare. Tell me the situation of it,  and is it worth getting into?
---
Im not looking for mad cash, I just wanted to do something that have a goal and have fun shooting. 
---
Are there people invested in doing FW? Because most people are saying there are spies in the general chat, so coordination is limited to specific corporation that do this side of EVE exclusively. 
---
Any general corp for recommendations?
---
I think originally you were right, but over time it's changed. The small sized structure that is the POS replacement is still coming :/
---
Soon(tm) 
---
Ah,sov null, it's an unassailable safe haven. Just a moment ago you were fighting against things being too easy. Rorquals are one of the most extreme example of ridiculous money you can make in EVE and it far outpaces anom ratting AND burners before the nerfs came/come in. The only bonus on the burner side is at 10+ daredevils you can outscale the operation; awesome for the 3 players in the game that do that.
---
The ore generation is bonkers and should be on the chopblock. Nerf ore by 35% minimally
---
That intermission shit is jarring, need to work on some fade transitions or somethin ... still cool vid
---
Depends what you're using it for. In some ways the Tengu got better. In other ways it got worse. 
---
Confirmed - I'm AFK at work right now
---
I guess at least goons keep their titan blob at home, right?
---
This will mostly work just as it did before. The CovOps sub became more useful and for all but the hardest sites you pretty much can leave it on and run the site with it. So less depot hassle, which is good. The problem starts if you try to get the sensor strength sub going (because Guristas, duh) you'll notice a lack of low slots, add the afterburner sub and things get silly. There's ways around that, a sensor booster can be scripted for ECCM for example, but I was always a bit miffed about those choices and then I EFTed the Loki and never looked back. Speaking of EFT, check the official forums in the PVP section. There's a guy updating the data files.
---
I'm not sure you follow the games development but there are planned nerfs to both ore acquisition and capitals. They're already on the chopblock which makes it ironic people talk about nerfs when they're in the pipeline. Additionally, LP payouts in null, LP costs and the ISK required to purchase implants should be reviewed and balanced all the same especially with new implant sets incoming.
---
It's time for a balance pass to catch burner missions up to current year.
---
My thoughts are that a lot of the movement issue is that Citadels are incredibly cheap. Even ignoring Delve, Legscy has a Keepstar within 6LY of all of their space. And a fort in damn near every system. 
---
Honestly that was a huge mistake. Keepstars should’ve been 4-5 trillion and forts 500 bil. 
---
It’s broken that you can shove a 10-30 TRILLION isk super fleet inside a 300 bil structure.
---
Or 500 bil capital fleet inside a 10 bil structure.... 
---
Or people like Simple Farmers can drop 200 structures in someone else’s space as a “Christmas present” 
---
Structures have made this game so fuckin safe
---
The boost to cap rechargers and shield rechargers will literally change get the entire meta of ship fitting for active and passive tanks. Cap boosters will be a thing of the past if they make this really nice.
---
Stop, I can only get so wet
---
You'd think so, but never quite sure...
---
That's gonna be a hard pass from me, bro. I'd be all for doubling a supers jump range and giving it a max 5 hour blue and 30 minute red for that jump though.
---
Wingspantt? Is that really you Bro? If some I'm watching one of your old vids right now!
---
o7
---
Not really.  What happens is that the serious problems, the ones everyone is experiencing and that we have to fix right away, wind up on Reddit after we’re already looking at them but before we have pushed out a fix.  So, it feels like posting to Reddit did something.
---
A few of us in different departments do read Reddit and might pick up something interesting that gets posted here, but it’s a roll of the dice, not very likely, and not every developer can fix every problem.  I can’t really do much for you on this, for example.
---
(Going to re-read the OP and edit in a sec)
---
I see nothing wrong with a 40 meter craft tackling the warp drive of a 15 kilometer vessel. /s
---
As exciting as the shield slaves were, I was blown away by that monument. Good job ccp art team, definitely stole the show there imo.
---
That trig AF got me excited too though, holy moly, time to finish the second half of AF V
---
Tiamat and Hydra (AT prize ships)
---
Nah, they're still good for scanning (combat or explo), DED sites, and they make a great sniper. I've also seen some interesting blaster fits for ganking.
---
Yeah to me the thing with CCP always was a certain portion of players learn to enjoy and succeed at some aspect of the game, some SMALLER portion of players would bitch about it OR some player(s) would find a way to achieve victory(non-exploit, just good thinking) and CCP would effectively bitch about it and next thing then sooner or later nerf hammer or worse would come out.
---
Inb4 Savior implants work on fax machines.
---
For this guide in particular: Probably not too good on the isk/hour. Doing P3/P4 is mostly a m³ concern, because P3s mostly lose you ISK. Making P4s, while profitable, in this kind of setup requires daily log ins and hauling, since you can only fit so many hours worth of production into a launchpad.
---
I do the least skill/effort intensive PI you can probably do, and that's about half a bil per hour, which includes all the time spent restarting/hauling.
---

Good to "meet" you Bro!

Honestly, a tengu can be tanked to tackle almost any subcap that doesn't use multiple neuts. You may have a difficult time breaking some tanks and some targets will be difficult to apply to, but you are fairly safe 1v1 verses anything BC and below as long as it isn't bonoused for neuts.
---
Yes.
---
Here's one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHIhp_vpeIs
---
Veritas built up a reputation for charging head-first into some of EVE's toughest code challenges and then somehow figuring out a way to defeat them. He's credited with being the key guy to get Time Dilation working (which greatly increased the size of battles that could happen in EVE), and the guy who architected brain-in-a-box (which greatly increased the number of people that could be packed into a single system, and greatly increased the speed of session changes). 
---
Veritas was also very famously the only person that could get CCP's notoriously twitch Alliance Tournament tools working consistently.
---
He left CCP for Riot Games in 2014 (ironically, Riot instantly put him in charge of the same challenges that he had solved for EVE) and his last action was kind of notorious:
---
https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=5050487
---
He prototyped a "dojo" tool that would have allowed players to set up instanced PvP areas intended for closed tournaments. So if I'm in Rote Kapelle and you're in Clockwork Pineapple and we want to have a 20v20 T1 cruiser fight in Ostingele, we can set up a dojo that would only allow the people we specify to enter, and then we can fight it out without Pandemic Legion dropping supers on us.
---
Needless to say, this announcement was highly controversial but Veritas was never afraid of that. ;-)
---
So yeah, when he said this particular problem was insoluble, I believed him completely.
---
Why a marauder Leshak when you could have a blops Leshak instead?
---
My exact thoughts. I remember seeing that near-identical implant chart all the way back at [Fanfest 2016](https://i.imgur.com/D4RhEk5.jpg). At least now we have names.
---
 Ever since this news of triglavian capital ship came up I gota wonder why would they need it.You can technically just throw more leshaks at your enemies/their structures and win.
---
Please do not @ me
---
OMG, this is BEAUTIFUL!! xD
---
Nice kill! Glad to see people fighting back :)
---
Falsely conflating small gang and fozziesov   
---
:ok\_hand:  
---
Shame on you dude. Do you even Eve ?
---
To quote myself 
---
&gt;Eve never had 60k pilots online for more than one event, that was hyped for weeks/months in advance. I can't even remember what it was...
---
That was not a representative player count. 2010 to 2015 had an average daily top count of ~50k, which is admittedly more than i would have guessed.     
---
But it's still closer to my mentioned 45k than it is to 60k.
---
https://i.imgur.com/QRKSrDq.png
---
Thanks Brah!
---
Thanks! I'm still figuring out the whole video editing thing but I'm impressed with this one :p
---
I like the idea but not sure how balanced it would be if it applied to other holds as well, definitely don't let it apply to drone bays though
---
they are balanced but only if you load them evenly on both sides
---
Is Katia Sae a player? Or just an Npc? 
---
only a few Titans in EVE. Promised.
---
i wonder how many people will fall for this
---
:Smart:
---
Flair rusing is a time honored tradition
---
You do realize that 2 of the ones I mentioned at that time were self published and were also done on extreme low budget right AO and DaOC ? DAoC didn't get bought out until quite a few years down the line. And there are so many others. Not to mention the non-MMO RPG games that were also done with online components or smaller groups. And don't even get me started about single player games.
---
The only true reason I see for this is that at the time Eve was being developed, about all the way until 2001-2002 data storage costs were indeed expensive. But even then, its not as if they don't charge for extra characters and once the data storage costs were brought down and phone modems and ISDN was phased out completely there was absolutely zero reason to not have done it.
---
Moreso, there was absolutely zero reason to not have planned for it even if they weren't able to do it at the time. But hey, this comes from people that take fucking years to do regular plain-of-the-mill balance passes just for starters.
---
And it took 12 years for your mom to discover she should've swallowed 
---
Pls make BS hulls more big 
---
They said that about cap rechargers and shield recharging mods that will see a dramatic buff but have stacking penalties. 
---
This is a beautiful and befitting celebration of someone who took the spirit of New Eden to its fullest expression. They’re a name now.
---
That’s the point. I don’t mind at all. It inspires greater things to aspire to.
---
I now have my own plan, I’m not telling you what it is, to get some kind of recognition myself. It needn’t be much. The simple fact of the nod of recognition is more than enough.
---
Make all corvettes cargo equal #AmarrCynoAltLifesMatter
---
I've seen enough heresy to know where this is going
---
The blinged Vedmak comes in around 850-950 mil and can do T4s fairly comfy while T5s with heavy implants and boosters. But even with that you'll still need some implants, so the total sits around 1.3-1.4 Bil. And now there is a Trig HAC incoming, we'll see how that will do.
---
Nothing beats Ibis trading. I will hear nothing else.
---
they also switched the background.
---
credit where credit is due.
---
You can very easily do t2s with a caracal, you should give it a shot, you might even get some cool skillbooks or bpcs for yourself! (that's the only reason I do them)
---
2% cargo hold increase per level, but 5% hull reduction at the same time.                
---
^(who cares about safety - just cut some of those bulkheads)       
---
Better yet, why either when they could make a T2 Leshak with ability to use XL disintegrators ?
---
Damn, thanks for the history lesson! IFW is recruting

Now it takes 15 to put them on SISI
---
I miss you Alq &lt;3 
---
Yes but I assume you're also counting in putting up buy orders, and selling via sell orders. That is where you're making your money, not on the fact that you made an extractor and injector. Do the math just right click buying, and right click selling everything, you take a loss.
---
The bigger fact here is this type of activity is consuming large quantities of plexes, and driving up plex prices. It's not the rorq alts.
---
Yeah I agree it's pretty bullshit people can make literal 200m per hour while flying ships that die to literal t1 frigates.

Noob question incoming:
---
What's the difference between the amulet implants and slave implants?
---
seems like trig caps are gonna be released before angel caps
---
Yeah I am psyched about the Trig HAC! Vedmak was on my idea fairy list, but like you said, I was struggling to make it sub 1b for T5s...although 1.3b total isnt that bad at all.
---
KK...I've tinkering in Pyfa now..main difference I see from the old days is a lack of low slots regardless of what configurations I've tried so far.
---
I would ballpark that I spend about 1.5 hours over the course of three days to make about 150m. That's 100m ISK/hour for relatively low-effort pursuit. I'm ok with that, and the guide is written with similar-minded people in mind as an introduction to PI.
---
Also, if you read the guide, you will note that it does not require daily hauling; hauling is only done every 3-4 days (pretty sure I said that several times). Doing the P1 to P2 conversion on the extraction planet means that you don't need to pull stuff out every day, and with the 3-day plan, you only produce about 45-50 P4s, which only take up half the space in your P4 launchpad. Even if you do need to move stuff to/from your POCO, all you have to do take 30 seconds to undock, import/export stuff, then dock right back up. You can pick it up during your semi-weekly Epithal runs, content in the knowledge that it will sit in the POCO until then.
---
We need triglavian cargo expanders that spool up cargo size

&gt;"DIRECTIVE 4"

Am I the only person who gets really creeped out by this? Because of the idea of a Triglavian, for who so much of their culture is based around the number 3, suddenly dropping a ***4***?
---
It's unfair you project your piloting prowess or skill unto others. We instead should seek to balance around good pilots. 
---
Lol right? Nobody ever shoots back at P I R A T or Marmite.
---
As far as named null sec systems goes... I’m not sure I know of a specific reason why some of them actually have names instead of just letter/number combos. Good question.

---
Also, I wanted to respond toward the encouragement of asking as many questions as you want about this game, and discourage the idea of made fun of for being curious. 
---
I’ve played since launch. There’s a fuck load about the game I know nothing about. If anyone responds negatively to you asking about a 15 year old, 7800 star system, multidimensional gaming universe..... they are a chodelord. Ask as many questions as you want. Just not dumb ones. Ya noob ; )
---
Very much a player. :)
---
Probably because they dock up as quickly as possible as soon as they get yellow boxed.
---
You sound upset.. too upset for a video game. 
---
The 1.3 is for T4s, with basic implants. Mainly 5% to all turrets ROF and tracking. Rest cap and armor implants, you can use the mid ones, don't have to be high tier.
---
For T5s you will need the really expensive implants, + some serious boosters.  Thus the pod will be about 1.5 Bil.
---
This is my current Vedmak Fit for T4s. For T5s switch the EANM to A-Type and the AB to A-type, up toyou if you like to use a recharger or booster for cap, I like the recharger better. It requires the 5% cap implants, both of them, as well as the Turret ROF and tracking. Also for T4s you need to use the standard 20% armor rep booster to increase rep / cap efficiency, which is cheap. For T5s you need to go better and/or stack it with hardshell on top of the implants.

You haven't seen what stopping on 100,000 does.

They only named asklepians. The rest were TBD but stil has the bonus focus and faction.

It looks as though slaves are being changed to a shield hp bonus (instead of the previous armor hp bonus), and amulets are getting the armor hp bonus instead.

Nothing.  New Amulet = Old Slave.  New Slave are shield implants.

Nice one.

OP doesn't even know the history of supers, yet comments on it with blatantly false information.

Maybe learn a bit about a thing before coming up with ideas on how to fix them.

Yep, it's buggy as hell - quite a few issues lately

/u/vily_r any comments on your offensive language?

You're trying a little too hard.

I have recently had to shutdown my own PI farm due to plex prices and lazyness. But profit per time is based on how much the Extractors are pulling up vs the time to flip them. So myself running 4 accounts and useing a multibox method can easily push 500 mil per day with between 12mins of work most days and every 4th a hour or so.

Considering most of our logi is in-corp... Hmmm these changes don’t really effect much other than having to use another character to scout with.

I predict you will still cry afterwards how we have 2:1 logi to dps.

lol those 10 tornaods were definitely isk positive

what frat slurs

Your mistaken, he misspelled Villy on the character creation screen.

What is it about TEST that attracts "leadership" who cannot contain their need to spout racial and homophobic slurs?

How disappointing.

I know for a fact you can light a cyno in a FW system.

What is this cynojamming you are talking about?

I started by upvoting your posts to combat the salt, but then I realized that downvoting is actually a bad of honor bc of the types you piss off. Take another downvote sir!
---
it looked good but I dont like the ship stuck there, doesn't feel like it's 'in' the tunnel, rather that it's just superimposed on top of the eeffect. 
---
I have even better ideas that the op might feel balanced:
---
Actually make them have negative warp core str so they are selftackled as soon as they undock.
---
Remove fighters, let them only use light drones (5 at a time ofc)
---
The NSA will have polarized effect so your resists will be 0 while it's on.
---
And finally 1 related change: make nulsec greensites respawn once a year.
---
A ship, no.
---
Many ships, that's another matter. Especially as it means you're getting isk directly from minerals, rather than needing to ship them somewhere.
---
Don't worry, there are already copies of the full show vod being uploaded right now. Shame on Vily for using such a word! SHAME!
---
No the Rag is best for this, especially when every other super fleet in the game is 75% Avatar
---
Needs a few more sticks to be a bundle.
---
We're these edited? Seems alot more crisp and vibrant than actual eve. 
---
It must really suck to be a LGBT+ member in TEST, when a high profile leader, such as Vily is using outdated and offensive slurs like that on such a public platform.  
---
have you tried 8008135?
---
Loki shat on Tengu after the patch. The Loki is actually better than a Tengu when using missile configurations in almost every situation. The Loki is also very versatile and is pretty much the best t3 out there now.

are u using armor Rokhs ? im so confused

6 mids = ab, 2 sebo, 2 TC, 1 cap booster

2 lows = 2 hardners

highs is rails.

Thats a Rokh unless im clearly missing a shit. Ether way, looks fun as hell, GJ

Oof. That's a spicy burn. 
---
This post was made not to criticize him for saying it.
---
It was made cause it's funny as hell that he did.
---
NO COLLUSION!
---
Excuse me pal that was like 10 minutes after this, totally unrelated conversation.
---
Just Vily's ego causing him to do dumb things. For details, browse this sub further. 
---
Yup, 300km armor rokh !! The natural Kryptonite of the wild LSH cancer Naga. 
---
I'll make the comment about my language here rather than elsewhere.
---
In a heated exchange on the Metashow with Hy from Snuff i used some inappropriate language. (the F-word) I have always tried to push for the improvement of the language culture in the alliances I have been involved in and obviously have succeed at some points and failed at others.
---
There aren't excuses and i know better. If anyone felt particularly offended i'm glad to talk to them personally and apologize. I have a role in EVE where i represent a lot of people at times and it is important to maintain their trust, part of which means both holding myself to a higher standard. 
---
This is a real truth. 
---
Are people actually offended because he said faggot? 
---
It's nice that they fixed it and sry im not knowledgable about AT shipprizes they are all out of my reach even if a Tiamat only goes for 90bil or even 70bil I'd have way better things I could do with that money.

Snuffed Out is a literal bundle of sticks.  Film at 11.

He needs straight talk, not burns
---
i was meme modded just for that post
---
I can either apologize or I can say I did nothing wrong. I DID do something wrong as per the standards of our society. In THIS culture of EVE i used to say the F word constantly. Someone privated convo'd me a year ago and said they didn't like it and i mostly managed to stop. Obviously in a heated moment you can lose your filter a bit and i did. So i failed them and I can only continue to try and do better.

FUCK SNUFF.... who cares if you dropped the F Bomb in 2019

Well thanks for the answer but yeah like the other guy said there’s no connection. Those are neutral, thank fuck

---
When you are right, you are right.
---
I think the gates are only part of the problem. Citadels are the bigger problem. In the old days, you could just leave and move to a new region that already had stations. Now you have to unanchor everything and move (and lose the expensive rigs) or leave everything behind, and completely start again. So there is no incentive to move to a better region, even if you could conquer it.
---
 I was born into a family of non-yeeters. Every morning before I went to school my father would say, "if I ever find out that you've hit that yeet, I'll thump ya."
---
"Yes, pa," I would always reply. It was a regular occurrence for him to burst into my room unannounced while I was relaxing or doing homework.
---
"Y'all hitting that yeet?" he would seeth.
---
"No, pa," I would answer.
---
"Good." He would then walk out the room and shout, "If I ever catch ya, it's a thumpin'."
---
It was a difficult upbringing. I had seen my friends hittin' that yeet at school, and many of them encouraged me to partake.
---
I would swallow my pride. "No thanks. I don't wanna catch a thumpin' from pa." As a result, I was an outcast. A loner. I became depressed, knowing that I would never be like my peers, I would never fit in - I would never hit that yeet.
---
One day, when I was still but a wee lad, I became curious. I was in my room, watching Instagram videos of fellas my age hittin' that yeet all over town without a care in the world. My intentions got the better of me. I stood up, my knees trembling. Carefully, I leaned onto my right foot and raised my hand in the air.
---
I breathed in.
---
"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!"
---
My father burst from my closet. "I told you I'd thump ya if I ever caught you hittin' that yeet, nibba," he ejaculated. Then, he thumped me.
---
I haven't hit that yeet since.
---
Before or after, idr which, mittens comments on how there's a lack of hate in the game, meanwhile you have Vily popping tf off on Snuff, then Hy saying "You'll see what happens [when you back stab snuff]"
---
There's no doubt that everyone on the show was aiming at Vily but what Vily did was p awesome. 
---
Vily made a mistake assuming Snuff wouldn't drop him
---
Vily get's dropped by snuff, becomes angry

Vily is now out for blood, not worrying about dipo bs

This is what eve is about, go on Vily.

Whos standards? Peoples offense levels over words these days is pathetic. You can tell the majority of society has it so fucking easy now that when someones says a word they dont like, appoligise and freak outs occur.

Eve is not a safe space, tell them to lighten up

nothing, it's dumb
---
What is it 15$? You can get prepaid debit/gift cards from gas stations, grocery stores, and pharmacies. You can find 15$ a month somewhere?
---
I didn’t know that EVE accepted gift cards lol
---
I think you mean *trebuchet,* my friend.
---
Damage is terrible and their control is minimal.
---
0/10, would not recommend.
---
Is there a video of the full episode of the meta show?
---
Mechanically they work the same as a debit card if they have there visa or MasterCard symbol on it.
---
Just because its all green doesn't mean it's actually good. Load up a comparison with all the XL shield boosters and then drag this abyssal in to see how good it actually is compared to other XL boosters.

Are you on your bike in the way to the store now? Haha

The demand for shield slaves will be so little in the long run as the new reps make armor supers more attractive and the fact that there are more armor supers in the game than shield.

Same supply from sansha lp, less demand for shield slaves.

no mention, but I suspect they'll swap them over. I'd certainly be pushing for such.
---
very cool and very legal
---
With special logi, that increases as you use it.
---
Just a word so why is it so important? You fall into the trap of thinking it matters as much as the people you seem to disagree with.
---
You have an option to show jove observatories. Is there a list with all systems that possibly have these?
---

oh no

If this community unironicaly lynches him for saying faggit then the zaza and Loki logi before undocking I don’t know the specific geography/region.

Are you sure about your assertion that P3-&gt;P4 is not a valuable operation by volume? I worked it out as halved volume and approx 10% more value - as you indicate, not worth the faff unless hauling volume is a concern.

 Ansiblex gates  Should cause jump fatigue.

as a fgt who is also in TEST, no it doesn't suck, nice concern troll though

 I just st use a very small .bat file. No need to install unsigned .exe files for such a trivial problem.

Nope, because i wouldnt have brought it up. You have a choice, listen or walk away. Not tied to a chair being beaten to death with it.

---
Thinking about getting a bus now - but i also hope that CCP will come out with something more creative.... as introducing something that players can already combat doing stupid thing is bad to game.      
---

I'm fine im still mad at you for saying fake things about me.

An astero cannot win in that situation, because a c13 has c6 wolf rayet bonuses on it and the confessor would blap it so fucking fast it wouldn't know what happened.

Fair enough, I took on this project so I can learn the technologies. I know it's a trivial problem, its just simple copy/pasting of file, so a .bat file is probably all you need. On the signing part, I am only a uni student, and I haven't really worked with signing technologies before so if you have any pointers on how to get it cheap/free, please send me a DM.

At least you can stop roleplaying the good guys, seeing as you as the TEST leader is morally bankrupt as per the standard values of american society.

Ehh TBH I thought that it remains confidential enough that people got away w/ it because they have decided to be some CCP accountant's wet dream
---
&gt; You sound upset.. too upset for a video game.
---
You do realize that we can all see the mountain of salt you've been spilling all over this thread, right?

No I meant for the image

This is, without a doubt, the quickest I've upvoted one of PH's killmails.
---
We are all brothers on this fine day.
---
What the actual hell are you on about? Hes done the complete opposite. 
---
He is playing both sides, even going on INN to argue his position to keep all the diplos happy? Literally everything he did was because diplos, he went out of his way to tell imperium diplos he was defending it due to his agreements to panfam diplos. He is part of the biggest blue NAP/NIP donut the game has ever seen and you claim he is being bold and not caring about diplomatic agreements with his choices.

Thanks, totally forgot about Youtube.

Stop being gay
---
alliance member 5647 of an alliance known for being cowardly and the beta in a relationship talks about "this thing called a pair of balls"
---
lul
---
yes dual tanking has been a thing
---
Stop it. Being gaybois under my thread is illegal!
---
no but twitch has a wierd TOS so it had to be taken down cos of him saying it
---
Gorgeous 
---
Actually... that's the left too
---
Thanks boss

Someone posted [this](https://i.imgur.com/Ckho4fZ.png) in another thread.

Its an advantage to hide your actual number of war targets(logi) in local or close by systems.  If you cant get neutral reps, its more balanced this way.  no fucking question.    
---
It was a piss poor system and always taken advantage of by high sec aggressors against those with the clear disadvantage of being new(er) to the game.  
---
Just joined the group.  Looking forward to the exciting banter that comes with dealing with current and ex-military service members.
---
its ok to say faggot vily 
---
vily tries to be godfather ends up creepy uncle
---
lol ok m8
---
Listen we are a very PC corp 
---
Betrayed anymore alliance mates and friiends recently? Or was that a one off.
---
Correct, this scenario is okay because choice is involved, a certain freedom, you could say.
---
Some would say they would prefer that.
---
Some will continue to cry about a word.
---
Yeah, its pretty hard to fight back in a 2 week old character flying a badger, or against 5 guys camping a station undock.  
---

Just a preview, cloaked ships will be untargetable but show up on overview, allowing for a future update to let you try and locate them using new gear.
---
There's also that thing happening. I think your ratio might be a little off ;)
---
lmao why you so mad bro?
---
the new map. It fails in so many ways:
---
* It's compressed to begin with
---
* It doesn't have half the stats the old map did
---
* Even when it does, statistics like 1 ship killed in the last hour and 50 look identical (if you can see them at all) 
---
* the Agency uses the worst version of the new map
---
* When jumping out of a WH it no longer marks the exit point on the map for easy scanning
---
* the contrast between black and the red sigs is for s\*\*t
---
* CCPs quiet admission it's crap by not removing the "try new map" feature even though it's been out for well over a year
---
(deep breath....)
---
yeah....so...new map for me, I....er... think it has problems
---
Man you are dumb lmbo
---
We've been shouting this for years. change FW, make it great again. If CCP does actually decide to change anything, FW can't be like null. It has to invite different styles of play through a mechanics-shift that encourages/enables smaller fleets/gangs and "the little guy" to stand a chance against the massive fleets. Also... seriously consider a frontline mechanic that allows constant action in certain areas. give the underdog a chance but give FW groups a good reason to stay in FW. 5-10 man gangs can't survive station timers but they can certainly fight over novice/small/med plexes to protect their home.

Can't say Pirat trash doesn't belong in the dumpster 
---
That looks nice, give me that.
---
mmm not really, just saw a terrible post by one of the scummiest guys in eve, thought i'd comment.
---
Is this how retarded you become if you believe everything they say on the meta show? 
---
Damn this sounds plausible. I buy it OP. 
---
Considering vily said it himself on the show. 
---
Very Nice Horde
---
&gt; scummiest guys in eve
---
Aww so I have a special place in your head if you remember me &lt;3 
---
If it makes you feel any better idk who you are. Just some salty cunt online that hates me like hundreds of other people.
---
Like that weapon tiericide coming in summer 2016(?). (It has been so long since that was announced I have even forgotten what year it was said to be coming)
---
Vod was taken down, full show will be posted to Youtube tomorrow as twitch has a 24 hour exclusivity clause.
---
Nice job! 
---
That's March 9ths episode. 
---
Uh so I'm a bit out of the loop, is 1B per hour really achievable now in this game? I haven't kept up on money making methods, clearly.
---
hundreds is abit low, but yer basically
---
Too bad extreme effort posts like this will be buried away in reddit in a matter of hours 
---
I got mad and went to RF their staging system changing fight values thing was literally 14m 55seconds when they get dunked. but history shows the also stop logging in for that matter no Panfam super fleet engaged even a remotely comparable armor fleet.
---
Lol! Maybe the OP failed to realize that?
---
lol ok bud. 
---
Snuff Fuck!
---
Same.  I'm not military/veteran, but having volunteered as an NGO medic in Bosnia and worked as a contractor in Afghanistan, I've worked with so many vets that I'm really glad this community exists for them.
---
No attention is bad attention, enemies are just fans. The more the better :)
---
It should do well, test the fit in small regular sites first. I have not done any wormholes in ages. The tank is a bit low, but the damage and tracking is good, it should do fine as long as you use the range to your advantage.
---
yeah my bad linked the wrong one.
---

Something about stopping when you're on top. 
---
Don't worry man, your posts were good once 
---
This still makes me sad
---
I am giving away a Hel because I'm probably not gonna play for a very long time lol 
---
Burn the Recidivists!! (In game)
---
I hear this a lot, and I can see why.  But, why not simply write something that wraps the process we currently go through anyway? have it programatically log out, select an account, log in and choose the character required?
---
:wtc:
---
I'll show you my flow if you show me yours
---
First thing I thought too!
---
wtf I love horde
---
And it's useless for its most fundamental purpose - navigation. Connections between systems are nearly impossible to see, much less make out navigable routes. It insists on showing the "real" location of systems, which is pointless when that doesn't correspond to actual gate connections. Two systems can be right next to each other on the map with ten jumps between them. 
---
You need to use the autopilot to get anywhere if you don't have the region memorized, which makes the fact that autopilot won't take jump gates even more infuriating.
---
One of our corp members keeps a region and jump bridge map regularly updated for us because the in-game map is a useless navigational tool.

We've been destroying their ships in abyssal deadspace as much as we destroyed drifters and rogue drones in there. Something tells me they are not happy about it. 
---
Yeah, have to agree, also in general it’s weird that we all have to use dotlan to get any useful info.
---
if he could kiss my heavy neutron blaster fitted on oracle
---
donate it to signal cartel
---
 Vily Confirmed. Most TEST pilots are fgts.
---
molok can  do dual tanking and with  shg slave set  its too stronk
---
Overall kinda yes and no. Triglavians seem to care a lot about human will and the ability to prove yourself against the odds, letting capsuleers into abyssal dead space wasn't some acident, it was basically an invitation by the triglavian collective to see if capuleers are worthy of being considered "part of the people" (Narodyna)
---
&gt; We have already fought with Ancient Enemy Azdaja (Sansha Kuvakei), the Deviant Automata (rogue drones), and the Corrupted Narodyna (Drifters)
---
You got that wrong, Ancient Enemy Azdaja are the drifters/sleepers and Corrupted Narodyna are the cyborg slaves of sanshas nation.
---
I'll sign up if they give me their pimpin' hat.
---
Murica: You hurt me by using an offensive word. I am offended.  
---
Other countries: Sup faggot?
---
What makes sense is pando and the guys from init who set that whole thing up said how that was the most stressful part... seeding rage with the ships.  Yes I know there’s no local.  That’s why WH you’re constantly dscanning and watching the holes.  Watching the new sigs.  But whatever dude.  Idgaf
---
DOTLAN got an update?
---
Ahh neat, so it took them 1 year to make the names then 2 more years to.....
---
Took me a sec, but to be honest I'd love to see the Dread have multiple supratidal weapon hardpoints instead of just one very big laser.
---
Not sure if you can implement either 3 Supratidals (HAW's) or 1 "anti-capital" gun.
---
Lol pirate dude calling someone else autistic. 
---
So.. Battleships? 
---
u can carry  small pos in  sunesis if u configure it right. 
---
and astrahus in battleship if you do same (works only on navy armageddon,navy apocalypse,paladin,praxis)
---
haw weaons for battleships

what about triglavian strip miners,triglavian gas miner,triglavian mining drones,triglavian 
---
WE STILL DONT HAVE triglavian weapon rigs
---
That's a very good scene, according to a friend.  I haven't seen it myself because I'm not an incel.  But he is and he recommends it.
---
I don't get it.  Faggots are meatballs with gravy.  Who's offended by that.  Vegans?
---
When you set a destination and half the time the next gate is auto selected in the selected item menu, so you can just click jump and other half it isn't. Whyyyyy 
---
Praise ~~Nergal~~ Nurgle!
---
Implants?
---
It should be called "bin packing" not "cargo stacking".  Software devs will understand.
---
Very nice! This has been long-desired by many.

Looks like they lost more in isk today, than in quite a while added up together
---
7.5/10
---
The lore is not confusing enough
---
This has happened to me before, and since you can see the brackets, you can burn towards someone who's cloaked to decloak them and kill them. No need for a special module with this bug.
---
My biggest pet peeve is that the gameplay is made for multi-boxing accounts but that you have to use a 3rd party app like isboxer to get the added features for multi-boxing. And i dont mean input broadcasting. Just having each client assigned to a core with the small windows able to change character screens integrated into the client somehow would be nice.
---
Wait im not good at lore, who are Azdaja, Automata, and Narodyna?
---
hey stocking
---
doesnt have the broken burst projector
---
Maybe get gud and dont expect a frigate gang to kill a super that the pilot isnt sleeping in

fucking faggots all around
---
That needs to be the skill description.
---
So you're telling me the people who have no idea about wormholes, talked up the difficulty of the thing they did?
---
Weird.

Should I even ask which countries these would be?
