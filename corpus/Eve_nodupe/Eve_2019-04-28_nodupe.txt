Consider it was explained in one of our most leaked channels your sources are bad.
---
U already have a replacement device for POS's it's call citadels.  The last part of the upwell puzzel we are waiting for is the fabled beachhead temporary structure.
---
But CCP Falcon has also stated that CCP has not decided on a time line for POS removal or any compensation for holders of them.  So it appears they are going to be with us for the foreseeable future.
---
Do you even played in this war?
---
Because skill urself have been our main enemy in tenerifis for a while (legacy member pov)
---
They were the biggest threat and our main enemy in a warfare I never saw before. Them, and scourge, formed many Loki fleets... Sure now we face Frat&amp;Co most of the time now, but don't try to say that they were useless. They tired us a lot.
---
why did he get banned?
---
Adversity. is recruiting
---
How many mortals can actually say they're fucking Mittani?
---
Uh... thanks dude. The temporary beachhead was the part that I was talking about. :P
---
I'm trying to keep them around 4-6 minutes.
---
imagine being so partisan that you think the only way people can call out the actions of your 'leadership' is that if they have ulterior motives are the 'opposing side.'
---
I don't think 'own pvp fleets/roams that did not involve the rest of TEST' would be a bad thing. That kinda sounds like camaraderie building, but I could see how if it's a turd group then it wouldn't matter
---
im thankful that avree lewis is doing all my modwork for me

Who?

Except it's not lol. Screen reading is not and never has been against the rules.

Yes, the PVP gate is in the same room as the exit gate.

None.

200m isnt that much. Get a T1 frigate and go relic hunting. You could possibly earn 2billion a day if you are lucky.

Good job.

Can't say it's surprising, heh

No one has explained it afaik, so far the closest was sappo saying xfiles leadership playing brinkmanship is bad.
---
You're welcome to correct my info.
---
Got any fits to share? Sounds fun
---
The way this event was handled compared to other high profile bans as well as the way it was announced and the fact that the investigation seems to have happened after the bans were put in place point to this being done by someone with no experience handling this kind of situation who also didn't check with anyone. Because the security team should have said not to announce or act on the info until an investigation was complete, PR should have said to not give details or even think about mentioning violation of the NDA as the cause and you would think that what's left of the community team would have recommended using the format from previous announcements about similar events when posting the initial announcement dev blog.
---
B...but Endie did all the work. He was superior spymaster in every way. He said so. He told them how he was the mastermind of all the things. 
---
Did you know Endie single handedly beat BoB? Yup. It was all Endie.
---
&gt; i don't really understand the problem people have with it.
---
You don't understand what happened on Serenity and what part in that bots played ? And do you want the same thing here on TQ now too ?
---
Their leader prefers General Secretary over President from what I've heard.
---
Funny cause it was a Goonswarm Owner!
---
Why u always set more than one alarm
---
Seems pretty clear to me. Don't buy a shield titan; instead buy more dreads. Then when you get kicked by test, you can sell them for decent ISK because they're not a shield titan.
---
&gt;Dmg logs are not chats though.
---
Similar enough and actually they are quite often output into chat 1st, recording actually logging them is actually optional in many games in order not to bog down the client on weak systems.
---
Yeah but your imagination happens. You imagine the alternatives. Your kids like listening to "Little Bees".  Maybe they are talented powerful people! Wearing suits and shit! Even though.. 
---
You know what? Fuck it. Goons suck rotten dicks and are eve AIDS.
---
Not my job, I'm sure Dran will post to the alliance at large but leadership was made aware.
---
Something can, at the same time, be a legitimate tactic, and make the game less enjoyable.
---
He doesnt know all the shit I've done in game.
---
BECAUSE IM A FUCKING NOBODY, I FLY UNDER THE RADAR IN THIS GAME.

Didn't the leader of Pandemic Horde name a fake currency after himself?

" With the switch to a 64-bit client we have decided to drop support for the 32-bit client, given that only around 0.5% of our pilots are currently playing on 32bit operating systems and the cost to support both architectures isn’t where we want to invest our development time. 
---
  To facilitate the switch to 64-bit client architecture, we’ll also be looking to change the minimum requirements for EVE Online. The nature of 64-bit applications means that they utilize more memory. As such, we’ll be increasing then minimum memory requirements for EVE Online from 2GB to 4GB when we release the 64-bit client.
---
 The release of a DirectX 12 client will mean that all pilots will need a DirectX 11 capable graphics card as a minimum requirement to play EVE"

And from the discussion thread about this dev blog;

&gt;or the crazy multibox setups just upgrade with a bit more ram and continue as if nothing changed
---
For legit players this will make zero difference. We’re already running 32, 64 GB system RAM + 6,8,12 GB or more of VRAM. The ones that will need to upgrade, or in professional botters case pay more for an upgraded host, will be the mass multiboxers that tend to part time bot or input broadcast and professional bots that run 20,30,50,60, or even 100+ clients at a time.
---
If all you’re running is 2-3 clients then you will still be able to do that even on some grossly outdated toaster with only 16 GB on it.

Theres been numerous good skirmishes but WinterCo has been doing a great job not feeding and winning multiple skirmishes per day. FCs on Winter's side have been doing great work around the clock and people are logging in pretty consistently.

Mrs. The Mittani?

I would highly recommend the Brave Newbie's Wiki page. A vertiable gold mine on almost every aspect of Eve life, right from the basics of ship fitting and navigation, up to massive nullsec fleet warfare and sov mechanics. The site contains a mix of video, audio and text-based tutorials, presented to you by the dedicated Brave Dojo team, as well as Brave Collective Fleet Commanders and line members alike.  
---
 [https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/dojo/class-recordings](https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/dojo/class-recordings)
---
CCP dropped it? That kinda explains a lot, the app is quite good with EVE mails and giving you a quick glance at what skill your training, would've been nice if they stuck with it.
---
1. Buy a server with E5 cpu, then creare multiple accounts. 
---
2. Setup fleet for your accounts
---
3. Go digging
---
I do applaud your efforts. However, the sheer fact that you have to resort into all of this and use such methods in the very first place, speaks volumes of just how truly fucked up the game design of Eve Online actually is. The fact that it has come down to this in Eve Online is a fucking sad disgrace.
---
The number of accounts, the hoops you have to jump through, all that shit, all of it put together is just fuckign rediculous. 
---
Nothing will change in this game until 5 rando dudes playing 1-2 accounts each, in T1-T2 basic ships can hop out of HS on a daytrip out of HS to rip apart a juicy target and successfully make it back. Things will just continue to move in their current directions until something like this becomes possible.
---
As tech moves forward, when I actually read some of the most recent and current stuff on OCR and what is available, how it works, what the system reqs are, etc. it is becoming plain and apparent that we are very close to the point where writing bots using any other methods will be the wrong way to do it.
---
With the advances in technology, the only way to truly address these issues is to re-design the game from the ground up so that botting itself becomes not worth it, or would require so many accounts to turn a profit that it would immediately stand out screaming its existance within the game.
---
Nobody is chaining you to your desk. There's a wide open door for you to leave through.
---
Just imagine looting that guy...damn I can't even fly most of those
---
I'll have you know he's the Mittani. Do not say such mean words.
---
Man I so liked eve.  Cruising with my tier 3.  Solo exploring deep space.  Running blockades to get the loot. Then I got canned.  By some asshat with like 6 accounts flying his own fleet.
---
No real input costs / less work
---
No,  the future is the 64 bit client. 
---
Due to cost CCP can't support both, so the 32 bit client is being retired.
---
Shield boost bonus is fine. The ramjag issues os a combination of several things.
---
1. Jag has a small sig. Makes anti-tackle ships less effective since its sig is ~105m with mwd on. Larger sig = more things can apply which means it dies faster.
---
2. Its a little too fast. Nerf speed by a small amount.
---
3. This goes for all assault frigs. Cut ADCU time by half, then give HACs a bonus to ADCU duration to keep them the same. ADCU AF are too strong. ADCU HACs are well balanced. 7s of invuln on a frig is a lot more balanced than ~15s.
---
Fire are Russians. They only can fight defensive wars. Sort of their thing, you know. Really good at those. Attacking?.. not so much.
---
We have a spare Yonis, half price, barely used?..
---
&gt;And there it is. Goons are the only alliance in the game they are the only example to think about no one else matters.
---
Nope. But they sure as hell pioneered it, perfected it and basically exported it on a mass scale which is now basically becoming gamebreaking.
---
Not many have witnessed a vagabond
---
Yeah, corps able to fulfill objectives independently is a net benefit for everyone involved, since it means we don't need to throw everyone at everything, and people can provide entertainment for themselves. Same theory as SIGs. We're very pro that kind of stuff.
---
see below.
---
From what I am understanding,  with the 64 bit client, the limitation of the number of clients per machine will be governed by how much RAM you have installed, as EvE will require 4GB RAM per client &amp; then you will enough left over after that to run your system.
---
What is this, a way for redditors to feel better about participating in the vicious smear campaign against Brisc Rubal, jumping on the bandwagon and brandishing pitchforks at the INIT Three? You were completely wrong and should be posting heartfelt apologies for having behaved like a herd of animals.
---
There are probably people you can pay to do that, you just need to find a group taking contracts like that instead of setting a general bounty.
---
Geniunelly one of the most effective strategies, sadly. Almost as old as EvE as well. 
---
A decade ago IRC used it heavily against the old RA, creating false alliance CTA mails for the RA spies in IRC, meanwhile telling CEOs in secret that "their corp only can skip this one CTA and make money, great job guys" - to all corps actually... so RA would sit there, waiting for shit to go down, like an hour or two every few days, meanwhile IRC would just make ISK deep in dronelands... then RA would not form once - IRC would attack and take an objective. Add that to all POS' timers being deep into US TZ, forcing RA to alarm-clock for any gains... 3 months of that - RA collapsed. 
---
I hardly remember any details, but I do remember saying at the time, that in 3 months of fighting IRC had won only 3 big battles total. The firsst one, the last one and one in the middle sort of deal. Lost every other major engagement. Still won the war.
---
Harkonen pig smh
---
Because the website would require manual input every time rather than just reading and interpreting a log file on your machine. Also would require ajax to continually update said page. Couldn't be developed without an outside cost associated with it either. Once you reach the max number of simultaneous connections the website will begin to bog down and issue data slower and slower until it stops working completely and crashes.
---
Oh god I wanna fuck the Mittani so bad omg....
---
Yeah you have to log off to do that!
---
I am struggling with that very same question.
---
Oh so goons are the only ones even allowed to do it then?
---
Oof, I need my covert ops cloak or i feel naked.
---
Could you point me in the direction of the story of this happening?
---
lol
---
I mean, having more then 5 options would be nice.
---
&gt;Hilmar doing the yearly PR talk, nothing to see here move along.
---
True. But this is a good question ? Will they let it die completely ? Just because he said CCP will be focusing on China market doesn't mean it will be via Serenity, or especially in its current form. If they do let it live "as is" then they won't be focusing on the China market.
---
I’m the Fucking mittani I don’t even play this game
---
Thanks for that pointless advice. If I wanted to leave TEST I probably would have done it sometime in the last ~7 years.
---
Man gets angry that somebody fucked over people of an allied alliance, which ended in CCP removing someone over an NDA violation, something that has real life effects and consequences on the person in question, which then turn out to be false.
---
I managed to scoop an unanchored Astrahus sitting near a gate in an untanked T1 industrial in lowsec once. Didn't have to scan it down or anything it was just on my overview. Got PushX to take it to Jita and made a sweet 700m profit.
---
It is quite a rush trying to grab it before anybody notices, here's hoping you find more!
---
More like dabigredoaf tbh
---
Actually I'm a nobody so check yourself.
---
I'm an avid PVPer in a nullsec bloc.  I mine and build caps to make isk (don't judge me) .  I set up near2, then stopped using it because I thought "This breaks the game.  The reason I play Eve is BECAUSE it is dangerous." 
---
I do have scouts, and I watch intel, but I honestly don't think near2 is a good thing.
---
He's really good at cloaky camping.
---
And he didn't get banned afaik salty scrubs are just salty.
---
This needs to be top comment.
---
Per my calculations it’s about tree fitty
---
SP farming.  SP toons re almost always at least isk neutral if you have implants.  I have many sp toons.  They make a "reasonable" amount of cash, normally, but essentially after the initial investment they can omega forever so long as you don't need to train skills on them.
---
The manual input is always necessary whether it's a chat channel in Eve or a website or something else. If you are worried about multiple connections you can always use a discord bot or something to recreate the chat channel -&gt; uploader -&gt; output flow, outsourcing the connections problem to discord, and it becomes equivalent to the already in use and working webpages. All that would change is the platform of the intel chat channel and hosting a bot instead of relying on people running a dedicated uploader.
---
I doubt the connection issue is as bad though. I admittedly don't know that much about web programming but I do know that there won't be more than one uploading connection per second (and that's an extreme situation). Listening connections are already solved. The example that I know handles them just fine. Maybe there is an upper limit but people will find creative ways around it if it becomes an issue. Even if it's a constantly refreshing hosted text file that gets fed to a locally running near2 where it replaces the old local chat log file.
---
Brand Newbros confirmed 100% homo, we kicked all the non homos after the last audit.
---
I can do 10 on one computer (miners, don't judge me, I do it to support PVP) and 3 scouts on another, but at that point things start to grind a bit.
---
you mean exactly like the old standings
---
Maybe remove warp core stabs from the game, too. You finally catch a vni and it's stabbed.
---
Dude what

Yes, but he wasn’t a tool.
---

---
The context of the apology was more sorry for causing this shit storm by buying the molok but who knows since mittens don't have evidence and all i heard myself was rumours. Was too much spin on the show to know either way honestly.

Ceo decided he wanted to leave but his corp did not.

Wish them good luck in their next endeavor.

Hey [Mar5hy\_eve](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mar5hy_eve)  how many clients could a HP Z820 run with ISBOXER? I just got this a few days ago:
---
Dual E5-2687W (8core 3.1GHz + HT)
---
64 GB ram (I might boost it to 128, 192 or 256GB RAM depending on if I want to pull apart a DL360p Gen8 I have sitting...)
---
1070ti 8GB
---
256GB SSD

When he was camping Eso, I killed all 5 of his bombers that were bombing a rorq with a Paladin. If he had been input broadcasting, that wouldn't have happened.

Is it ever really an invasion if massed supers aren't used?

There's probably a distinction between the *player* (not a problem) and the *safety enjoyed by the player* (definitely a problem). High PVE rewards should be gated by degrees of risk, skill, and effort.

Ok yes. Tremendous to see you thanks for coming to the dinner ))
---
Listed a few dozen of these ships for 74m and change, logged in this morning to more ISK than I'd have expected if everything sold. No big contract sales, although all the VNIs had gone.
---
A little investigation later and this showed up.....
---
Someone has bought one and made a fairly inexplicable market typo, albeit one I will happily take advantage of.
---
Just in case it wasn't clear, this was solely a reddit ban. 
---
But tl;dr a bit of brigading but the whole situation was honestly stupid and escalated needlessly for many months. We talked a bit and everything and I think both agreed the whole situation was nothing but a gigantic waste of time. I didn't see a reason to keep him banned after that.
---
Solely an r/eve ban.
---
Also FYI we average about 2 bans a month - that includes spam accounts.
---
Hopefully you can give the money back unless the client is a goon.
---
Wait where do I fall on the list?
---
I'm guessing it must've been a heated argument or something?
---
Are there options for "shit player, good person" and "good player, shit person"?  Those are the options I want.

I'd love to see it revolve around covert ops/cloaks. You don't show up in local for the initial 60 second invluln cloak, if you're in a combat recon or have a covert ops cloak fit to your ship. it makes sense thematically, wouldn't be hard to implement, would give a reason to vary what you fly, and would completely gut bots.

&gt;I mine and build caps to make isk (don't judge me)
---
Nah, no judgment. We gotta get our caps from somewhere, at least you're not just mining to export to Jita.
---
very low, very very low.
---
This is completely untrue, shortsighted, and frankly stupid. what happens with local being deleted? sure, you can put even more accounts out on gates to watch for the gate flash. at that point you have a choice, are you going to dock your ship every time there's a gate flash? good luck getting decent ratting done. or are you going to wait to see if it's a hostile on the gate? Give the hunter time to actually see where the ratting ships are. then it's a race, warp to and tackle vs align time.
---
But even that completely ignores the main advantage of deleting local. YOU CAN HIDE CLOAKED IN A SYSTEM FOR MORE THAN A DAY. So yeah, the giant vaginas that dock up every time a neut hits local will have their little bots on the gates, and will run and hide every time there's a gate flash. BUT. you can put a cloaky character in system, and leave it in system for a longer timeframe then the bots will account for gate flashes (a day or so). Then you just log your cloaky in the next day, and hey whaddyaknow? The carebears are back out ratting with no idea that you're in system, and you can kill them.
---
sometimes you just unanchor it and leave it cause you dont care.

I am heavy user of ISboxer, I enjoy mining with up to 9 accounts and right after CCP update the TOS about input broadcasting ISboxer made it so you had to knowingly enable it. So this sorry it was a mistake BS is BS in of itself.
---
Ok this is pretty epic but I am only just getting back into the game, trying to understand everything that's going on. 
---
You are cloaking alts in systems where people are ratting in big ships so you can cyno onto them and get some salty mail? Also something about selling the information you gain to others.
---
"Hey we can win guys, we just need 2-1 numbers!"

That's fine, the original comment I made was saying his sources are shit. Find one of the nearly 100 people in the 'opsec' channel who will leak it. That channel leaks so often we routinely say hi to the leaks.
---
10% of a 3b hole can fit enough T3Ds to fuck you up.
---
Ummm....no? I honestely don't give a flying fuck. An Astrahus is like ~1 bil isk. Its the equivalent of a large POS stick or thereabouts. When you're the person who is in charge of 3000+ citadels and regularly deal with units of isk in terms of hundreds of billions of isk I long since stopped getting excited about single structures of that size.

What's your Tristan/Vexor fit? Both ships are considered powerful, versatile ships in the FW 1v1 meta.
---
Watching that wow.

Get the fuck out of here either you knew what you were doing or this is some shite rmt coverup. You know, like when someone is telling a lie and they over explain it.
---
Wait why the fuck would you cross out the timestamp, we know when it happened we can see that it's between 16:01 and 16:02 per the transaction above and below it
---
That was only done to highlight the line in question, not to obscure anything
---
Uh... there's no story. Just the combination of drifter mechanics with the addition of citadels, lead to a meteoric rise in lazy, low-risk rattlesnake farming.
---
Before that, if you wanted to kill high-class sites to make the ISK that is actually any better than nullsec, then you had to commit sieged dreads or... well, you could run them in a full fleet, but that's not good ISK for your time.
---
So, basically sieged dreads were your only option. So, people would rage roll to find those dreads and kill them.
---
Now, your rage rolling efforts are met with just barely missing rattlesnakes that MJD'd out of the site, as soon as the new sig appeared on the probe window. So, now high class is dead.
---
Svipul is a great ship. 
---
A couple of years ago it was the king of gatecamps, but sadly CCP nerfed it pretty hard. That said, it's still a good ship today and you can have a lot of fun with it. 
---
I'd suggest it in more of a small gang composition rather than solo -- if you add sensor boosters you can get close to instalocking and grab tackle/web while your friends apply DPS. You should still do fine against frigates and other destroyers solo.
---
Yeah that makes sense. Actually that would have been the right buy order amount too.
---
Good, I'd been worried that it may have been dirty money intended for someone else.
---
I was initially worried that it was dirty money intended for someone else. However someone else had an explanation that's more likely - the buyer was typing a buy order price and fatfingered the extra 0s.
---
If I was nice enough to do that I wouldn't be playing EVE.
---
I wore my last fat finger market mistake (which was quite a bit smaller than this one...)
---
time is precious
---
A small bounty is a great way to piss off a "law abiding", "minding my own business" type carebear. It mars his character sheet with a gigantic WANTED label branding him as an outlaw, and to get rid of it he has to lose a ship.
---
I've had this happen on a couple occasions.  Poor guy adds a digit and boom billions. This is the primary reason I don't keep tons of liquid isk on hand...one extra number gets very costly when market pvping.
---
Dat name doh
---
Welcome to the current US political scene as shown by all sides.
---
He's fucking the Mittani? What?
---
Hey I just wanted to be polite and let you know I didn't read this, nor care to.
---
Im glad Blood of Gods lost a Nyx but the bigger story here is that you only killed one supercarrier with 10 or so dreads plus carrier support.
---
Good job, I guess, but hardly worth a smugpost and "ironic" AAR.
---
You killed me so I'm guna change out standings from fuchsia to light red. '.;..;.'
---
But can you do anything?
---
A T1 frigate will have problems, but any frig that can fly faster then a warrior II can at least hold one. T3Ds can hunt VNIs, and many of the assault frigates would work as well. It mostly comes down to being able to deal with drones and avoid incoming rat DPS simultaneously. I've even know someone to do it in a polarized bomber, but I wouldn't recommend that option.
---
EVE isn't like that though. The last couple wars looked like attempts to do just that (in a controlled way) but they came off like scheduled play-dates. To "bring the excitement back" would require large groups to be willing to actually lose their wealth. They will never do that. Null is the way it is because that's how null's population wants it. That "static nullsec" was the goal, not just an outcome.
---
As for a big war driving up new player counts (that aren't just alts), big wars don't really do that. Few people outside of EVE care about or get mildly interested in what happens in EVE. The idea of what EVE might be or could be is what gets most people to try it. However, the reality often falls short of expectations and so retention is poor. One of the biggest factors in this is not pvp but a lack of pve content. People need engaging content while they train and acquire needed assets. EVE is very lacking in this area (although some effort has been made to address this).

Are any ships capable of exceeding the 4K necessary to speed tank warriors without an MWD? It seems like the signature bloom from an mwd would leave you vulnerable to rats.
---
Apostle is a fax.
---
Lone carriers can be killed by organised gangs
---
The context makes it worse.
---
&gt;What we need are incentives to live more spred out, and we need actual benefits from taking sov. Right now TCUs are fucking pointless and Ihubs are meh, all you really need are citadels.
---
Exactly this. We don't need big wars - we need thousands of smaller wars all over Eve. Even in highsec.
---
I tend to make speculative purchases instead (the VNIs I was selling were all purchased at 51-57m and I'm still sitting on a thousand more of them)
---
Not a fan of managing even a hundred billion in buy orders, much less quarter to half a trillion.
---
Had the opposite happen on buy orders the other day. Somebody decided 20 hulls at 15k a piece was a reasonable price. Can't argue with that.
---
No, because that costs more fitting (which it doesn't have any to spare) and takes away the utility high that all assault frigates are supposed to have. Also it doesn't serve the purpose of nerfing the ramjag without nerfing the jag in general by replacing a tank bonus with a dps bonus, it'd just be a straight buff (if you can jam the 4th launcher on there).
---
My worst market mistake was like that (although still very small). Went to sell 5 Enyos to a 24 million buy order (fair at the time), didn't realise in time that the buy order was actually 2.4 million.
---
Cheap lesson to be fair.
---
No, you use an MWD. Many ships have a bonus that reduces the sig bloom from an MWD, and even without that bonus you can often still keep enough traversal on the BSs to survive on grid.
---
Hes the fucking tuz
---
I don't know why but my mind went "Make a color for role-players so they tag themselves and we can shoot them on sight".
---
Part-time role-player by the way.

Just make it a -10 to 10 standing slider with a color gradient between dark red and blue with "steps" for each integer

So I guess you've never used a capital?

No guns, bottom decked out with drone damage ii and one armor module, Middle is warp disruptor MWD and an immobilizing nodule. Rigs are armor stuff. High slot is the drone range increase module.

---
TL;DR
---
- We had a problem with other Russian corps
---
- They are writing shit on forums about x-files CEO
---
 - CEO talked to Valkorsia and Valkorsi told to pack the shit and gtfo
---
 - They had an option about disbanding and joining other Russian corps in test (Soviet Union or Xaos reloaded)
---
 - We will be strong and other stuff from x-files CEO
---
Rough translation from his statement.
---
So -10 all the way to +10? I mean might as well. for those that are color blinded an option to just tick a default shade of color with a +X or -X would be nice. even for those not color blinded cause we ain't gonna remember what color is what beyond the ones we got already.

I wanna commend you sir for suggesting a change after an experience where your change would have got you killed unlike the rest of new eden where people would suggest the opposite.

Its a good idea for sure though and could also work against the attacker too, the site defender could trigger the next spaen in an attempt to get the next wave to attack and ewar the " invading " party.

Yes!

The joke is that you arent allowed to FC any saved after feeding your rag :)

Battleships that have change to spawn with long range web that would be needed to be focused down. Would kill a lot of the afk ratters/bots. More pointing rats like you said, so bots wouldnt be able to escape as easily.

I need one for "shit player, shit person, but somehow still liked by people". Can we make that one happen? I think it should be booger green since I'm colorblind and it would just look gray.

I mean, yeah, we should definitely do that too. But I'll take whatever movement on this issue that I can get.
---
This has been offered many times.
---
It doesn't address real problems with safety because safest regions do not rely on not being tackled for defense (they rely on capital umbrellas).
---
👏
---
Be humble OP
---
I'm not proposing this as a solution to the root problem -- and I explicitly say that in the post -- it's just one way to make the situation incrementally better in the short term. We should still definitely be pushing for broader and more comprehensive solutions in the long run.

Omg you just solved the answer to cloaky camping. Cloaks that expires after x amount of time. Genius!!! I hope CCP is listening!
---
One of those eagles is not like the others
---
He needs to drive cloaked.
---
You are talking about solving the safety issue. The very reason why Eve krabbing is extremely safe is that there are lots of motivating factors to band together, particularly Rorquals, so people have banded together and created ultra safe regions. Now you are adding one more to the motivations
---
Better yet, five buttons and a text box so you can just make your own damn standings.

New player; what are contract scams?
---
Oh i see, that's interesting. I've heard of using citadels to kill drbs but didn't really think much of it. I just have a fleet, and far from being not good isk for your time its more isk per hour than super ratting so it seems fine to me.
---
***Good.***
---
Local still needs to be at least delayed. Hell, a 5-10 sec delay wouldn't necessarily have that big of an impact on legitimate players but it has the potential to have a huge impact on bots, which is good.
---
Um, why do you have 4 of the exact same shade of red, and 3 of the same blue?  How would that improve anything?
---
And what does the brown mean?
---
TBH i'm surprised that more rats don't point you. I think it should be more along the lines of all elite frigates, cruisers, battlecruisers and battleships should be able to.
---
Dudes hard in that construction zone right there.
---
That did bring a smirk..
---
In case you haven't noticed, most VNI or other small ship ratters (who this would impact the most) are already under super umbrellas.

So are we talking DND archetypes? Or are we just asking for rainbow colors so we can identify our degenerate friends?
---
Most large and small ship ratters are under super umbrellas. Doesn't change the fact that you create one more reason for others to move. They are still better off in umbrella regions after your change. After the change, in both regions they get tackled but the umbrella gives them regional protection and someone to come in after a cyno (and SRP for small stuff for that matter). Before the change the non-umbrella VNI could at least rely on warping off.
---
Does this matter at all?
---
&gt; This is the primary reason I don't keep tons of liquid isk on hand
---
This is also why I have the market nag-windows turned on.
---
I usually leave them behind and named "for sale 50% of market value".
---
Works out 50% of the time.
---
Je suis fucking Mittani
---
You create a contract and advertise selling a Vexor Navy Issue (cost of about 70-80m) for instance for 50m, only in reality there's an added 0 and the cost is 500m. This is, of course, spelled out on the contract, but the scam relies on people getting greedy and clicking without reading.

I am always impressed how pirates don't fit scram, web as standard.

Interesting. Yea, I notice with pricing various loot I always have to go directly to what's happening in regional market because a shitzillion people have buy orders for 1% of what an item is actually worth.

I'm aware, but "And yet you post" isn't about PenifSmash, is it?
---
Im sure this post will get un-removed in a week.
---
i can shine some light on this
---
Long story short it was over Mobile depot names. 
---
the other Russian corps in test alliance dropped depots and used them to recruit or offer services, some of them in Russian.  This pissed x-files off (because they lost recruits to these other corps because of mobile depots - hilarious i know)  and so they killed them.     This caused test diplomatic team to get involved because killing blue stuff is not allowed.  
---
When x-files was told that they are not allowed to kill these depots the CEO freaked out and had quote "a melt down on par with one of trumps tweet storm tantrums"  and said he was pulling the corp out. 
---
From what the x-files CEO told me, after he cooled down he went back to the diplomatic team and apologized for his behavior and said he didn't want to leave (this is largely because a sizeable part of his corp doesn't want to leave test and hes going to lose lots of people if they leave)   But the diplomatic team said that his meltdown was inexcusable and they told him their was no coming back, they could merge or leave.    
---
TlepecBET (x-files ceo) is to proud to merge or so he told the diplomats he will leave, shortly after he informed his corp, a large group of his members confronted him and that caused a massive argument, by the end of it a large part of x-files told the CEO pretty much to go fuck him self and left.   (largely because in private he tried to spin this as test going rogue against him personally and when the truth over depots came out the members lost their collective shit) 
---
 Week in and week out the diplomatic team had to deal with one pants on head retarded drama after another with x-files, it has been building for a while but this was just the final nail in the coffin for them.   
---
It was so bad that test had to hire 3 new diplomats not to long ago because so much of the teams time was dedicated to dealing with whatever daily
---
My first thought:  (former) CCP Punkturis slightly negative?

Perhaps look at the visible spectrum as a model ... then make it all grey so as not to confuse the various forms of colour blindness.

Do you mind copy-pasting the fit?
---
You can open the fit in the fitting window, and in the left side in the fitting menu, ther should be something like "export fit" and export to clipboard in EFT format. Then you can paste it as text.
---
Then on Reddit you can highlight and click the Code button to format it properly.
---
Your idea is gonna push more people under umbrellas. With all the recent inactivity Delve is like 30% utilized atm. Esoteria is under 15%.  You want more stuff dead, I want more stuff that, this won't make that (statistically) happen.
---
A more useful feature: the ability to add corp/alliance notes on a character.
---
+5.7%+5.6%

You can't just leave the affiliates out of the picture. Those are isk producers and important too. If you ignore them you scew the relevance of it even more

&gt; However, the sheer fact that you have to resort into all of this and use such methods in the very first place, speaks volumes of just how truly fucked up the game design of Eve Online actually is. The fact that it has come down to this in Eve Online is a fucking sad disgrace.
---
Nail on the head. The game is fucked, has been for a while.
---
My favorite part was how he spun the apology part.  Pay attention to him when its first talked about it... then he tries to spin it to his spy network already told him that.
---
During the course of normal fleet fights, especially around a structure, ceptors are 90% of the time pings and scouts. However they can be fighting their own small skirmishes with enemy ceptors also burning pings, and they can be called in to pick tackle on a fleet that is running or relocating to get as many points as possible on stragglers. There are also some occasions in which you should be with the fleet; you can provide some utility by instalocking, harassing things like dictors, and shutting down booshes.
---
Did you make it from memory? If yes... Cool! If not, why oh why?
---
For awoxers or cynobaits?
---
So long as that tackle is a scrambler which turns off mwd I'm good.
---
I respectfully disagree. I think that's just a good argument for doing nothing, which is a worse idea.
---
Yeah, have been doing that, still annoying though... :/
---
It will arrive a bit later, stay tuned!

Local delay is such an obvious botting fix, makes you wonder why CCP dont do it...

I once accidentally contracted a load of researchled BPOs to some random guy instead of an alt at no cost. He was nice enough to contract them back for free, which was remarkably lucky for me.
---
They were only worth a couple of hundred million between them but the time lost on research would have stung.
---
Nope. Push for mobile cyno inhib revamp and further anom respawn rework. That's how you fix the umbrella.
---
I think you're right and that Olmeca is a bit blinded by his dislike of umbrellas. I don't think the scenario he speaks of it too likely, mostly because of the tedium involved in jumping in FAX+carrier to save a VNI, a hundred times a day. Leaving aside the fatigue incurred, the caps would have to come from somewhere, that somewhere being naturally the standing fleet, which means they would not be available if a super gets tackled (by players :) ) which would make it a tricky proposition.
---
Downvoted but true
---
Yep.
---
Have you considered our lord and saviour the dual neut Osprey Navy Issue? He can help guide you through these troubling times....

Do you also have a version with kills last hour??
---
Don’t get me wrong here but how would it make it worse. Some colors might look the same but that means you have a few options less, but overall you’d have more options.
---
Yes, thats INIT.
---
As a non-colourblind person, his use of colours is nightmare fuel. They are all over the place.
---
Eh, saying "They have no resources they need" could swing both ways. It's a matter of intonation, which fails written down on the internet, obviously.
---
But context should make it clear.
---
You're off by an order of magnitude.

Use 150mms for fitting and dual MSE (drop the web). Lose the cloak (it seriously affects lock time) and use faction probes (charges) ALWAYS. You can probably get away without a co-pro if you do this

You could fit a web if you want, often people with do 280mm arty fits with a web and point and try and kite. Idk where you’re using it or in what circumstance so maybe this standard fit is not right for you

It really isn't. That guy with 50 Covetors or rorqs or VNI bots? Now he has 48 VNI bots and a couple of eyes sitting on in-gates in pipe systems or pocket entrances. Reprogram those bots to watch the overview for new entries and bam, you've got an intel network.

Wormholes means you'd kill more, but general roaming wouldn't get you that many more kills once you pass someone's sentry bot.

---

---
Seems like a great idea but, the botters would just deploy some scouts to meighbouring systems and once someone appears in local there they would just dock up the bots in the next system.
---
Fair enough, see what you mean. Here is a hair-brained idea, what if there was a way you could "create" a wormhole connection into a system of your choice. Not sure how that would be balanced to be fair to a defending entity, rather than just an attacker. Then at least attackers could wormhole into botting systems.
---
Pretty much agree with this guys philosophy on this situation, even if the campers are on my friends, at the end of the day it's cancer VS cancer.

Now that will keep him busy, keeping it up to date 😂😂
---
Well, no... the fleet works out to a lot less ISK per hour, because you would need at least a half dozen characters to do it. It's more something that newer corps do, to help newbros make ISK.
---
After considering the time spent rolling holes, and rolling frigate holes, and running the logistics to support such farming, it really isn't that great of a payout, unless you're actually doing the running with dreads. The payout's the same, it just means that you respect the value of your own time.

Anyway, cheers. :)

---
&gt; I think you're right and that Olmeca is a bit blinded by his dislike of umbrellas. 
---
I'm not blinded by it. You folks are blind to their negative effects
---
I do research and collect data none of you collects. For example, umbrella regions lose under 3% of all their mining. This averages 10% everywhere else. Imagine how much content people are being denied by half of Eve moving under them.
---
3 years ago I was arguing space was too safe and I was being laughed at. Today even most of the GSM have to agree on summits that not enough ships exploding is a problem. By every shred of argument we pour our sweat into we get small changes like cyno inhib anchor reduction. The game needs more. If it was left to Imperium etc. we wouldn't have any. I can't even understand their endgame as idk what they are doing with the 200t they must have collected as taxes from Delve so far. It clearly doesn't seem like content creation as if it was, they have enough to unblue everyone and burn the entire Eve. 
---
Don't let the flak I got from voicing all that trick you into I am the one hating umbrellas. They are (and you if not flair baiting) the ones hating the idea of game balance against krabbing interests.
---
they do that for 4 months at least. so nothing new about that.
---
it's actually pretty easy: in chtz, wc wins objectives/ in eutz fire/legacy does.
---
so it's pretty much a stalemate for now. neither side can push into enemy area due to tz difference.
---
but there is a constant threat of dropping on miners, ratters etc on both sides. and eventually with lower adms, luck etc a side will be able to get an enemy ihub which leads to a fight without those annoying cyno jammers
---
That's some nice DOTLAN skills, keeping it up to date might be a challenge though
---
We're you in malpais or etherium reach?
---
lol. who cares about thera
---
you put clones in anything smaller then a fortizar?
---
&gt; Is that really the case?
---
In the beginning of changes I was doing wh rageroll fleets for Bombers Bar. We were killing Rorquals left and right. Then everywhere got drier and drier. The game turned into a graveyard of alliances without a super organized umbrella. They happened to be a beacon of content for whalers. SOLAR, Care 4 Kids, FCON, Provi, and alike. Each such alliance dying dried their host region. Over time most regions were dead and kills became rare. Do you know where their people are now? Go to zkill and check current alliance of 100 top Rorquals for each of these alliances. I did. 80% of the currently active members are either in Delve or Esoteria.
---
Meanwhile, Delve was farming more than the rest of Eve, and was untouchable. A year ago I moved there to do something about it. Ofc as a single person I had a minimal (but still significant for 1 person) effect. As more and more people got into assets they want they even stopped krabbing. Meanwhile, nobody has something to do with all those farmed titans. So the game slowly deteriorated, and today even Delve has half the activity that it had a year ago.
---
Is there a way to give discord channel access based on in-game location? 
---
I aim to have chat channels based on people being docked or not in certain stations. Then I will open up my J-lounge Astra in an empty c4 c3/c5 where we can all have a drink and a chat
---
Now we know who's reddit account is linked to the lost Nyx.
---
Placids were i grew up in eve
---
Fun place
---
because ccp wants you to run the most accounts possible because it provides them with more revenue.
---
the easier and more desirable it is for players to run as many accounts as they can in parallel is what's best for ccp's bottom line.
---
Bless you
---
It should go back to what the roq w which s origionally designed for a mining support ship not a mining ship
---
Not sure what you mean?  NEAR2 does also ping yes, but only for specific channels. 
---
What my suggestion would do is apply pings (if set to on) for all channels. There would be no difference between the ping sound you hear for corp chat, jita local, alliance chat, or.. yes.. an intel channel.
---
But using this for an intel channel would not be the thing to do if you were in any other channels at all.
---
Otherwise you'd be checking the client for every ping, which you'd quickly learn to ignore by that point, id wager. 
---
I guess my suggestion is an "all or nothing" approach to it - not selective.
---
Legacy/Fire co. declared war, now they can ask for peace...
---
Hah, lucky bastard!
---
completely agree.
---
The problem is that afk vni ratting of an actual player and bot vni ratting look pretty much the same. This means CCP has to review every report and get enough evidence for a ban. Especially after the most recent init3 ban. It takes a lot of time and then those asshole botters just create new alpha accounts with VPN and such. With players disturbing bots heavily while ccp looks into those cases we can make them suffer before they get banned
---
I once tried to print out a .gif
---
Wormholers btw
---
50 is too much, but like 2 or 4 extra standings could be nice
---
It's all I currently do I dont use excavs no point really
---
Yes, that would make my point useless, but also  most likely your feature request. Having to decide between pings from every channel or from none would end up being most likely none just because of the spam in some of forced channels Local, Corp, Alliance.
---
You could also just use the highlighting feature that already exists.
---
&gt; Bots should just be banned
---
  https://imgur.com/a/tOhouGv
---
You’all have to talk to INIT.
---
Then you get the swarm of tickets sent to CCP declaring "THIS GUY IS A BOT" all because they were at their PC and warped off. CCP need to filter through these, as well as the legit bots- and determine 100% of the time, who is who. Imagine if people started getting bans for not botting all because they played the game all the time while ratting?
---
Didn't have 10 stations in every system though.
---
&gt; so people have banded together and created a few ultra safe regions
---
  How dare people live and use their space, and defend their alliance mates?!
---
This article is pure cringe and shows just how badly you are out of touch with the game. The replies by pando and dumbdwarf illustrate the glaring problems with your article. Do you login anymore?
---
Make barges effective enough that people will still be willing to multi box them with their rorq but still no where near a rorqs output. 
---
PANIC affects sub caps in its area so if you do get seriously jumped, hit PANIC and your hulks or whatever are still safe for 6mins till response come or you dead.
---
Just throwing the idea around, literally a shower thought.
---
Do they though?
---
Glad you are having fun exploding
---
Most of fighter micro comes from retargeting. If you want micro rorquals rocks are the one that needs to be more like NPCs. Imagine you had to frack big rocks into smaller rocks, target smaller rocks and scoop them.
---
Half a dozen? Our minimum viable fleet comp is 4 battleships or 2 battleships and 3 cruisers. And when you start stacking on more battleships or cruisers the isk/hr doesn't drop because the site clear speed goes up dramatically. 
---
What's a C5 site clear time with a dread then?
---
This is why you keep no more than a billion or so liquid isk in your main account.  I could have taught him that lesson much cheaper than 6.7b
---
I'm a month in and the closest to winning I got so far was when some guy tried to attack me but he missed pretty much every shot so he just warped away.
---
Yeah, the mini-game part. Another thought I had, was to give excavators a fuel/energy bar, that goes down at a variable, irregular rate. When out of fuel/energy the drone becomes inactive, but saves enough to be recalled to the ship. Make it irregular to pilots can't time their drones together and in between accounts to run out one after the other, you'll have to actively be looking.
---
Or as you said, make excavators blow rocks into parts so they have to re-target frequently, there's quite a few things to be made of it.
---
the classic salty goon response of saying incorrect and easily disprovable things in order to look less dumb
---
Honestly, that's one of the best ideas of how to handle a local delay that I've seen, and it seems in keeping with the purpose of a gate cloak.
---
Blops bridge does this already
---
Yeah, there's a few creative solutions. To be perfectly honest though, when botting is this widespread the first thing you need is to give the security teams real teeth - including coming up with creative ways of dealing. I'd say something like not being able to extract SP before a character is 4-5 months old, plus the old Security Task Force "report bot" button and its 3-strikes rule. (check the old 2012 team security devblog from CCP Pollux)
---
The problem is, all these things reduce eve's concurrent users and the subscriptions bots are using.
---
this
---
So you guys can just Blue the entire of Eve.
---
Pretty much this. I've been accused of input broadcasting when fleet-warping my hulks to safety. Half the people don't know what cheating looks like, quite frankly.
---
Someone on /r/eve accused CODE/Goons of IB because "they all warped in at the same time".... le' sigh. To think thousands of players like that guy probably jam up the ticket queue.
---

Oh nice. Goregeous images. Gonna pull these up whenever I get asked: How does Eve look?

holy fuck thats a brilliant idea, google streetview in eve..

Not sure why you seem to be confusing me with pando , but even if I had FCd that fight which I didn’t , I can still fc if I wish lol :)
---
This is awesome! I'm not sure if it's because I started doing pvp in the last 2 weeks or what, but I feel like I'm seeing more of these types of stories pop up. It's awesome to see them. Keep at it! Nice work.
---
walk through your suggestion for a second...
---
For starters, the amount of rorq pilots will drop, "good" i hear you crying, but keep walking through this, so most rorq pilots that multi box rorqs will stop doing that, instead they will multibox hulks or skiffs with a single booster on field..
---
So now Hunters are wandering through systems, gone are the days they would walk into 10 rorq's in a single grid, gone are the 5 rorqs on a single grid, with changes like these you will have 1 rorq, hell maybe even no rorq and 1 orca or porp just pumping out boosts while a fleet of 10+ hulks or skiffs mine, your hunter enters system and all those pilots are off grid before you even land, the orca's probably off grid as well, and if your lucky you might get the rorqual.
---
You'r basically wanting changes that will kill off whaling, make it more efficient for miners to not use the ships you want to kill, make it more efficient for miners to use ships that can get off grid faster and avoid you all together, your basically asking for changes that are going to kill your own playstyle.
---
People asking for a delay to local need to walk through that thought as well some before asking for it again because the potential blow back from that change could be a total disaster as well.
---
Hey, we can't kill that single cruiser whose drones keep taking everyone out. Let's shoot at the drones.
---
Says almost no NPC ever.
---
just remove excavs, problem solved.
---
literally excavators existing are the start and end of all the balance issues with rorquals.
---
Grrr gons grr
---
The % warning messages are so fucking broken and annoying, but I leave them on for the same reason. This item is 37282926484917274% higher than normal, are you sure? No, CCP Round, it’s not. Go home, you’re drunk.

More rocks, less per rock, rocks spread further apart.

Nice! Thrashers (and destroyers) are very cheap for the firepower they pack. The Algos is my fav. Keep it up!
---
No.
---
I wrote a bit of software that does this actually, it watches for the common WWW, or DDD or RRR etc and Play's specific sounds I have set for those noises, so when some one in fleet calls out with oh fuck help www and I'm busy on another client I get the audible ping and quickly go looking for source.
---
This would be something id love to see in game, but id like to be able to pair a string with a sound so I could replicate what Iv done with a 3rd party tool.
---
This isnt about making intel better, Near2 does an amazing job of this on its own, an people bashing near2 are idiots, because its not just near2, I feel like near2 gets all the flak but almost all big alliances have their own intel maps that all do the same thing, suggesting that an alliance not have intel is the most idiotic thing I read on this reddit and it happens regularly.
---
Or Just get good?
---
god i wish NPCs would keep shooting the ship that's been killing them for hours instead of switching to the PvPer that wants to help them.
---
It’s funnier when you explain it for us, thanks! /s
---
I agree in principle but not with your choice of colours. It should just go from bright red to dark red for -10 to -1, black for 0, and dark blue to blue for +10. But we should definitely have more than five colour options.
---
&gt; The problem is that afk vni ratting of an actual player and bot vni ratting look pretty much the same
---
Yep, which is why we also need changes to ratting to make it require a brain (e.g. dynamic spawns, more tackle rats, rats that can warp or burn to you intelligently like diamond ones) and more APM (e.g. rats target drones) as well as changes to local.
---
This is absolutely the minimum that makes sense but I don't understand why CCP haven't already done it. It fits perfectly with lore/immersion - you don't appear on overview, how does the beacon know you're there? - and it moves in the direction of better balance because at least now the person entering system gets to load the system before the locals are aware of him.
---
We payed a lot, but we completed our objective + loot was ours
---
The umbrella is the biggest problem, and there's several threads (mostly featuring you :-) ) with good discussion about how to deal with that. (I favour a strong shift in the cyno vs inhib balance by making inhibs much easier to keep up, have them shut down active cynos when they activate, and giving cynos a spin up time so you can't go "oh, inhib, I'd better cyno".)
---
But this is still a good suggestion to address a different part of the safety problem.
---
Need some colour-blind hostile colour gradients. Red-Green diverging everywhere.
---
Yeah, the Algos can be an absolute beast when used correctly.
---
Do any rats scram? I thought they all just pointed.
---
Who will then talk to Goons to get the final okay
---
Let’s not make hunting too easy and risk-less now

If the last Meta Show would go viral in the States, and someone in the staff of the president would see that, and/or give it to Trump himself, and he sees the spy-network of Mittani, i think he could become the next big intelligence boss for the United States,  specially  if hears what Mittani claims to know, - after someone else says it, and as in the show said by himself, even without hard prove, cause no skycourt, just a allyleader....
---
I don't know of any rat that scram. Maybe in burners, not in anoms.
---
upvote, cause player has fun at playing eve active!
---
Congrats, you've learned that personal capability and learning how stuff REALLY works makes all the difference. Most EVE players, the vast majority of them, never get that far. Never stop learning, never have the masses (or any corps or alliances you join) drag you down to their level and mould you into an obedient follower.

Well then you need a fighterbay in the rorqual, but i would like a rorqual with fighterbay and fighters, so when a saber or light tackle comes in you can bomb them InHell...
---
rmt vni
---
&gt; Reprogram those bots to watch the overview for new entries and bam, you've got an intel network.
---
Sure, but programming a bot to watch the overview as opposed to reading an intel channel is way harder. Still pretty doable, but there's a major difference IMO
---
AFAIK Jag is the only one with 3 launcher hardpoints, which suggests an intention of keeping its damage in T1 range. If CCP decides to go for the angle suggested in the OP, that's the first thing they can do as a straight up 33% buff to the rocket portion of the DPS. Otherwise damage boni are just trying to squeeze power out of 3 launchers. I don't advocate for or against the OP position, I am just saying this would be the first step to make Jaguar into a heavy hitter.
---
Ehh... They already know how to target rats, which I would presume uses the overview to know when a site is complete.
---
We have never announced that we will give everything we have on Serenity.
---
Mantou(our CEO) believes that we don’t really need much attention to stabilize our domination of Serenity. On April’s fool, we formed over 550titans while everyone else on Serenity could have only 350.
---
We will bring more fun to TQ. And maybe, just maybe, we could give Rooks and Kings back to you guys.
---
I like it! Good work.
---
Right, but that could be a simple matter of setting the overview to only show rats, then continuously clicking on the top few. The trigger for 'site clear' can be as simple as looking at a single pixel on the top row in the overview, which will then always be the same shade of red if there are rats present, and any other color if the site is clear. 
---
You could set up something as primitive as that to detect a neutral coming in, but you couldn't get their name or ship type or where they warped to. You'd need the program to be able to read text for that.
---
It's like the MS Paint version of Dotlan. Props.
---
Disconnects you from the game on a successful hit
---
Total noob here. I played a long time ago for a couple months and am trying to get back into this game. I am currently an Alpha Clone.
---
I decided to haul some freigh around and found in Domain that I could buy and sell dairy products for a nice spread. I had a bestower and got blown up when I was in .3.  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76452284/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76452284/). 
---
Two questions:
---
1. The pop-up said that I "foolishly engaged in criminal activity" but I don't even have guns on my ship. So how is it possible that I did something wrong?
---
2. Would it have been possible for me to tank this and jump? I got hit going through the gate on the way in, but on the way back is when they got me. I think b/c it takes longer to jump. 
---
I am not complaining that I got killed and don't really care. Just trying to better understand the game and it's pretty daunting.
---
Yeah for real
---
What is this fun you speak of? I thought we were just supposed to complain constantly?
---

i have killed a vni in a talwar with berserkers on my tail, but also fed a svipul that should have been able to tank praetors and hobgoblins. it's a bit of a gamble really, it generally *hurts* to take a chance so always be prepared to warp out.
---
af and t3d are go to options, wolf especially sees quite a bit of success in the south due to 90% em resist right off the bat.
---
Exactly, I don't have any friends
---
At my peak I would die in thrashers 20 times a day too (okay, maybe 10 times a day) because I would throw that thing into so many engagements. I'd do 1v1 but I would also happily throw it into blobs trying to take out something expensive before exploding. They are amazing ships for the ISK.

Keep up the good work.

vily would appreciate that

Lol, I used to do this when it was called escrow kiddo.
---
How does Mittens still look like hes mid to late 20s
---
It's true, our fleets of F1 monkeys all warp at the game time because we broadcast. Over mumble. Verbally.
---
I feel your pain fellow colour misidentifier. 
---
They should overlay with numbers on the icon and have it as a overview tab to display a plain number. 
---
Also have you tried the beta colour blind mode? Did nothing for me but curious for others.
---
Nope never even seen one
---
Maybe next year....
---
what ship did you use for that
---
Yes it would be very helpful also hire someone that has less brain power to re work the overview settings so they make sense with out hours of study. Show ships would be a good start make it a button.
---
The unfortunate answer is the intel you could gather while virtually invisible. 
---
At current I can d-scan someone down within 4-10seconds. Make me invisible for 60 seconds and I could tell you where everything on scan is. Plus I can see who is in local and who they belong to, and get the layout of all citadels in system. 
---
I would love to not be in local till I decloak, love love love it, but I just don’t see it happening.
---
Lol but I really can :)
---
Pink would be Garmur pilots.
---
Come join a wormhole corp. Every ship in the fight matters and the isk overflows our wallets.
---
Wormholer btw.
---
Almost like the amount of systems under an umbrella shouldn’t support a large amount of people. 
---
Almost like there should be incentives to spreading out and taking risks. 
---
Almost like rats shouldn’t keep spawning where they’re getting genocided daily.
---
just replace them with tier appropriate diamond rats. you need points to hold them down. or they warp to pings.
---
Thrasher
---
Good thing you don't have flaired up so I don't need to be ashamed :)
---
Who is the hottest dude in BSB?
---
Good idea, but does nothing for super rating and titan BFG ratting, both have a warp core strength beyond what even a large rat spawn can tackle.
---
One thing I'd note is that while that would indeed make VNI ratting more dangerous, it wouldn't have any impact on carrier/super ratting and I really don't think the game needs another balance step in favour of capitals.
---
Also, if you are *actively* VNI ratting, you should be able to get away if someone enters your system.  
---
If you afk rat you deserve to lose your VNI now and then, but tbf in that case the current tackle rats already work since your VNI is prioritizing enemy rats from the top down, leaving the tackle frigs for last.
---
was actually going "hm this sounds like a good idea"  until you said "increase the yield from where it is currently"
---
rorqs already overkill enough.
---
PH rage..
---
Best idea buries so deep down.  
---
This is great though. This could let you tag standings with silly tags like "Blue in &lt;System&gt;, otherwise neutral", which would promote such mannerisms and probably make freeports more interesting.
---
Justice for thee but not for me
---
Pics of said RX7?
---
So what you want is a carrier, not a rorqual
---
Give me an orca and multiboxed skiffs/hulks over 10 rorqs any day. Forcing mining operations to dock is a great way to get someone to whine in intel and bring a fight.
---
can you link your zkill?
---
pics or didn't happen
---
I am not sure I like the idea, but what about no local and no scanning while cloaked (any kind).  When you are cloaked, you wont appear in local, but you cant see local, or see whats going on unless you are on grid with it.
---
But tapi Lost 2 (was it 3?) Fortizar anchoring in a row were they just stood down in eutz.

Got to put in the deaths before you get the kills

---
His corp CEO tomorrow: “we’re leaving Placid and moving to another region”
---
OP: but muh map bruh 😭
---
i disagree.    CCP actually goes out of there way to make life harder for people with many accounts.    Even look at some of the latest content, Abysmal space.   Its setup to only allow one account in.  
---
Many other aspects too:  no shared inventory or wallets, no multi-account management options, etc.
---
If you’ve ever tried to run more than 2-3 accounts you’d see it right away, its a nightmare.
---
May we also get bluetral color? That would the most used one of the entire palette
---
Thing is, krabbing is something 90% have to do to fund fleets or other fun projects. A blanket "make krabbing less safe" would just hurt players.
---
A split between low risk low reward krabbing and high risk high reward PVE would be better.
---
Iff the top of my head something like deadspace that prevented warp outs except via a gate positioned in the site would be a fun way to up the risk. Even more so if it dumped you out at a predictable point in the system
---
Ahhh - I remember when 200 mil was a lot of money...
---
I also made this suggestion on the forums, where you could stack different overview tabs up
---
ahh lol, the classic 'my opinion over actual facts' that's ruling the majority of toothless dumb fucks in america that considers everyone else 'mouth breathers'.
---
noice! xDeeeee
---
Alright, fair argument. How about something like hitting dscan when a target appears on an overview, then sounding an alarm? They'll know to check the dscan window for a record of the ship, which catches all bar the dscan-immune cruisers. 
---
I'm just saying that a sentry that tells you someone has entered your pocket or pipe systems is not a huge problem if bot software is already running gilas, vnis and nyxes and warping to poses whenever a neut enters local. It doesn't need perfect intel. Removing local works against people who actually play the game, but against the biggest bot users it's not as effective.
---
As someone who spends 90% of his time in a mining barge, I don't think this is unreasonable...even with the advantages you mentioned. Gate cloaked only. Once the gate cloak timer expires you're on the list.
---
1. It's much more likely that the "criminal activity" message was for the people who attacked you. It shows for everyone, but it will be their names in it, not yours. You are right that it would be impossible for you to do anything aggressive.
---
2. If you want to try and haul in lowsec, you need to learn the cloak MWD trick and use it. https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Cloak_trick - there are probably examples of it being done on YouTube too.
---
If you want to do hauling/etc. it's generally a good idea to avoid lowsec while you're learning things. Lots of lowsec has pirate-y groups that will kill anything that comes through. Also, if you're going into dangerous areas, make sure to use an empty clone. :) Then your loss is basically nothing if your ship is cheap.
---
There's an ingame channel dedicated to haulers that might be able to help you. "Haulers channel" it's called.
---
It used to be like that but there was a bug that would sometimes jettison your ship from the structure. They couldnt fix it so they just got rid of it. I miss it too.
---
Avoid Sunlight and Delegate stressful tasks to others.
---
Are you really trying to make a fat joke about spaceship nerds on an MMO subreddit?
---
Play another game.
---
Have you tried not being colorblind?
---
And have web frig warp in every minute or so.
---
Yeah, but I had too much free time so I just decided on a hobby
---
Them sleepers hella do.
---
&gt;It really isn't. That guy with 50 Covetors or rorqs or VNI bots? Now he has 48 VNI bots and a couple of eyes sitting on in-gates in pipe systems or pocket entrances. Reprogram those bots to watch the overview for new entries and bam, you've got an intel network.
---
Make them do it then and find a way to get through that. Anything, no matter how small, is infinitely better than doing nothing.
---
Barges are shit tho, not enough ore hold or dps vs rats, and orca is shit for yield. The only viable solo miner is really a rorq and that is the real problem
---
A few of us were brain storming an idea the other day about turning the Rorqual into a true mining dreadnaut. Instead of excavator drones the ship used seized mining laser that had similar mining amount to the current excavator, limited to three turrets. Completely eliminate the PANIC module and force the Rorq to siege up for maximum mining results. Give it one single dedicated fighter bay for defense.
---
Interesting theory. Except someone putting in an order for 67,300,718.83 would have no need to put any extra zeros at the end. They would simply type "67300718.83" 
---
It's possible they simply forgot the decimal point and hit enter before double checking, in which case the game would read the bid as 6730071883 Which is what seemed to happen here.
---
Thera is not a wormhole
---
lol. how is an intermediate, unneccessary step of making copies and build from those copies instead straight from the BPO less work to you? I'm probably missing some important detail on the whole process..
---
Tunnel Snakes rule!
---
ELI5 what you said?
---
How do you see the top rankings for solo on zkill?
---
But cyno jammers have been massively buffed so...
---
&gt;ever tried to run more than 2-3 accounts ... its a nightmare
---
Good. Because having to use even more than 1 account is beyond me. While it's been a thing since day 1 of Eve and Im sure there's more games where having multiple accounts is a thing, it's still kinda bizarre to me. It's a MMO. Those things we use multiple accounts for are meant to be group activities. 
---
Moving a capital ship? People flying the capitals, people lighting cynos. Mining? One person in a ship that gives the bonuses and can compress ore, others mining in exhumers and hauling industrials, like a good ol' mining op.
---
Et fucking cetera.
---
I wonder if, had CCP known the game would take this route, they would have restricted running more than 1 client on a single system (I know, I *know*, there's way arounds this) like other MMOs.
---
It's a pic of the irl crab nebula. (Don't lie some of y'all were wondering.)
---
please tell me what internet space ship games you play :)
---
Totally agree. If you can swap clones in keepstars without affecting the jump clone timer, you should be able to do it in NPC stations too.
---
And the problem with that is ... ?
---
I mean, in J space you can literally dscan the whole system and warp onto grid with all the structures to get numbers online, if you're flying covops. This would still be nowhere near that level of risk for the locals.
---
Not having local appear for you while you are not in it could be fair.
---
It's tough being King.
---
&gt; A split between low risk low reward krabbing and high risk high reward PVE would be better.
---
This already exists, the low risk low reward area is highsec combat sites. The trouble is players feel entitled to low risk high reward PVE.
---
They were playing on a gate with some wormholers iirc and the Hel was tackled long enough ~30 minutes or more that Odin's Call managed to boat over and help kill it. All of this was during a stratop.
---
He's an idiot if he thinks skill injectors make a game p2w (not commenting on the genuine problems that they do cause btw).
---
You're a bigger idiot for reviving a 2 months dead conversation thread to make a point that didn't need making.
---
I find highsec more risky than nul though. I put more at risk running lvl4 missions what with ganks for less isk than VNI ratting in nul
---
im not talking about running multiple accounts simultaneously, im just talking about owning multiple accounts.
---
Make it possible to mine 4 hours worth in 40 minutes of focused control with rapidly diminishing returns afterwards and I’ll actually use that damn Rorqual for mining once a month.
---
Implement diminishing returns through belts composition and rock sizes and make mining barges greater that rorqual at cleaning up when boosted and I’ll gladly boost for others using my mindlinked clone and perfect bonuses few days a week.
---
As it is right now, that character is flying command ship on incursions or a shitfit BNI because that way I don’t feel like killing myself.
---
PS: Who am I kidding, I haven’t logged in in four months at this point...
---
That's not me redacting anything, just using a highlighter over empty space (there) or unimportant info (date/time) so it stands out more
---
Yeah that's what I meant. Fat finger oops with no checking.
---
In any case, I'll put that ISK to bad use.
---
&gt; I once accidentally contracted a load of researchled BPOs to some random guy instead of an alt at no cost.
---
This is why I ALWAYS contract to my own alts from my contact list. I just drag my alt's name from the contact list into the contractee field and click 'next'.
---
Well im glad you guys Came hopefully new things Will happen and things Will change in nullsec if you have taken over space     some new People is what tq need.  A new alliance that takes over stuff.
---
Talk about hotkeys!!!!
---
Exploration and drones are waaay easier with hotkeys set up!
---
Yea. And when they find out they can talk here in the subreddit
---
You guys are doing gods work
---
Is there a way to see who is first for solo kills with a hull on zkill?
---
Get good standings with them and they will rep you instead of attacking you.
---
ADAPT IDIOT
---
i love Tomalak and Blights Wretch, both are really cool, Intigo has helped me a lot but that dude always offends me for my poor decisions, Intigo if you're reading i love you but you're a bitch

Pretty sure this is the worst experience for any and every Hunter.

There's nothing with sound but there's an in game feature where you can have a chat tab blink upon certain keywords that you enter into a list.
---
seriously. would help alot!
---
Sounds like an awox story waiting to happen
---
👀
---
Logs are useful. But maybe they should implement a buffer that holds till you exit eve or a set time an hour or so then dump the log to disk.
---
looks like 2 boson
---
Do you know you can open people &amp; places ( Alt+E ) window and stick it to the UI right ?
---
Are you doing this in low or null?
---
Look at how many FCs let people bring their drakes!
---
select the ship, on overview you'll have on the right a tab of players, those are kills both solo and with other players, on solo you'll see the ranking for solo kills
---
I agree Tomalak is a real QT
---
lowsec, i dont feel like the thrasher may do well in null solo
---
yes,  select the ship, on overview you'll have on the right a tab of players, those are kills both solo and with other players, on solo you'll see the ranking for solo kills
---
This is a good idea.
---
roam FW space
---
They're for literally whatever you want them to mean.
---
You're literally describing the period before mining rorquals, and the game did fine then.
---
To be fair the AI should focus on the guy hitting them and not the one who just showed up but isn't the priority based on EWAR and PvPers use more ewar than PvEers
---
I've long wanted a "we ain't blue but we like you" standing color.
---
was 3, thats true. though the same is for FRT, only they anchor astrahuses and reitarus. 
---
If you look at the strategic situation, neither side has a significant edge. WinterCo has the better isk efficiency for sure, but TEST has alot more breathing room thanks to the highsec market. Also no war was ever decided by isk, but by players willing to participate.
---
He doesnt understand how isboxer works
---
So no local while cloaked, sounds fine.
---
I dont actually play the game anymore except for fleets, but I can confirm that half my corp was ready to awox every single one of them shortly after they joined TEST.
---
/r/Eve:  
---
&gt;Cynos are too op and there needs to be limiations on teleporting ships.  
---
Also /r/Eve:  
---
&gt;We need more WHs in every system so we can teleport ontop of ratters with no prevention or counter.
---
What was ur main motivation for continuing to play when starting  to play Eve?
---
So we going back to 2007 where all pvp alliances hold token figurehead sov and a small number of super building systems, and all the line members run l4 missions on alts?
---
Sounds like fun....
---
Except covert cynos can work under cyno jammers.
---
Wow...
---
There are wardec corps you could hire to wardec your target and kill them
---
I agree
---
I mean, not for nothing, but couldn't this be based on modules/rigs and fuel costs?  You could even have the costs be non linear.  (one fuel block multiplier for one clone, 4 fuel blocks for 2, 16 for 3, or any such type of mapping).  
---
The idea being that you would have to 'pay for' this, so that clone spam doesn't happen.  
---
Speculating, there may be reasons the limit is one : In a wormhole, the current limitations force a corp/alliance to anchor multiple stagings so that characters may have multiple clones.  If you allowed an infinite limit in one station, with no additional penalties, it changes the calculus for a wormhole corp's logistical needs.  I think, I am speculating.  I think it would make an interesting risk decision : multiple stations with multiple single clone bays, or one station with multiple clones.  Which is cheaper to run?  Which scenario mitigates risk correctly?
---
Now, if you made the rig/module which allows for more clones to use the same/similar materials that the astrahaus currently is constructed with, that might help reduce proliferation of astrahauses (astrahausi?) by changing the demand for said goods.  (Which would probably also screw up the market for other goods, yeah yeah).
---
It just like that old story. One man said to his wife that he will fuck her really hard. But in reality he cannot hold for a min before this whole sex 'thing' over. Yeah, so plz donate some sex pills to TEST.
---
Allow multiple clone facilities per structure. Each facility gives +1 or +2 clones.
---
this has been asked for for as long as i can remember, I guess theres some wierd reason it cant be done, maybe performance?
---
More tackle rats would be an awesome change - groups with active pilots and a defensive umbrella would be mostly fine, but bots would no longer be able to escape 99.9% of the time.
---
No, old rat AI will target switch on new arivals to counter an old dual-box trick where you brick tank a ship and warp it in first.
---
This just goes to show you how much powercreep has happened over the years.
---
Right click... You get to see all your bookmarks...
---
What should they have responded with instead?
---
Thought I'd see some spectacular map of placid worthy of r/cartography instead saw a napkin doodle. I got excited for a moment.
---
Interesting wormhole Corp?
---
Get t2 tank ASAP then work on t2 launchers. :)
---
I shield tank my curse.
---
Any time you're higher on a kill list than Suitonia you're doing work.
---
Ishkur has drone bonuses, so the enyo should get a rep bonus.
---
Ok. CCP marketing needs a heads up! Fantastic.
---
&gt;The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting
---
*fights*
---
You need to know how to google. This gets asked literally every day - go look up one of those threads.
---
It would make sense but I'm against it because it would make this game easier. The annoying little things you have to do are what makes opportunities for mistakes.
---
This way he can play offline
---
OK that wasn't bad
---
Tools at least has some use or meaningful function. Gobbin's can't even run an alliance.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Increase the number of rats with tackle.  
---
&gt;Is it a real solution? No, of course not, but it's a relatively easy tweak and it would move the needle in the right direction.  
---
&gt;The reason why I suggest this is that I nearly lost a VNI a moment ago when a hostile jumped into system while I was tackled by rats. They're generally quick and easy to kill, but it was timed so that I just barely escaped before he landed in my site. If there had been one or two more tackle frigates, or even a tackle cruiser, I probably wouldn't have gotten out in time.  
---
&gt;Food for thought.
---
Been suggesting it for ages now. Random Interceptors, dictors and HICs would be a good addition to the game. Also for VNIs since the 100 MN VNIs move pretty fast webs or grapplers are needed.
---
It really irks me that it says 'somewhere in wormhole space' and then proceeds to be in Kspace... But otherwise, I like it.
---
Not entirely sure but it would be best if you made separate channels meaning different discord rooms. Risky tho, they could use it as free intel if they wanted to bash you.
---
Learn how to use the google and search button.
---
good for you. IM happy you are having fun my dude
---
Right, but that's only for the last 7 days.
---
6 month! that is nothing ... no honor 4 that ;-)
---
Wouldn't it be even more accounts to force people into barges anyway?
---
the fact that it's super interesting, hard, vast and complex
---
select hull &gt; top, you can choose all time and monthly
---
In addition to Elo, WinterCo has over the last six months built up a pretty significant FC team from across timezones that have been running strat ops, HD and skirmishes. Given that the southeast is such a meat grinder, it's actually a great place to train new talent.
---
i hear firing people that just got bitch slapped across the face for doing a dumb thing and then hiring a bunch of people who could very well make exactly the same mistake cause they havent learned from a bitch slapping is definitely a good way to run an organisation and a group of humans that make mistakes.
---
some random dir suggested
---
doubloon -&gt; gobloon
---
wow so self absorbed
---
I agree with this. We do need teamwork anomalies.
---
I don't really wanna follow suite, but seriously, you can just do a search on here and find answers to this question. It does get asked a lot. I'd go mess around in FW space in the Caldari area. You can get a lot of solo and small gang stuff all the time. At least that has been my experience. Welcome back :)
---
well staging and some of the footage is from w-space but yes the majority of the action is in k-space.
---
&gt;because ccp wants you to run the most accounts possible because it provides them with more revenue.  
---
&gt;the easier and more desirable it is for players to run as many accounts as they can in parallel is what's best for ccp's bottom line.
---
\^\^\^ This.
---
Note the declining players numbers, sometimes decline quick, sometimes slow, sometimes just hang for a little while without decline before declining again but overall its a downward path.
---
Meanwhile, while that number is in decline, average accounts per player either holds steady or keeps slowly rising. No big jumps like PLEX prices, just a very slow steady continuous rise while player number keeps on bleeding out and diminishing.
---
Nice!  Too bad pods don't count as solo.
---
I'm the number 18 top thrasher pilot of all time, despite not having played in quite a while.  Knock me off my spot!  only a few thousand kills to go!  You could get that this summer.
---
I highly suggest you rework your fit for pure arty goodness; you'll net WAY more kills, and when you can't kill them in the first volley or two you have a chance to escape or kill their transversal.
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75007405/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75007405/) 
---
dual web is nice, but that AB isn't doing you any favors; you're dead or the target escaped - the AB isn't going to change that 99 times out of 100.
---
Any chance u can get an evefit of your fittings?
---
Alright chill lol - the point was that you could pretty much pick something any alliance director (or any leader of any large organisation ever) has ever said and apply the same logic of them being self absorbed and delusional. Mittens doesn't really stand out too much from the rest in terms of personality.
---
buy a titan alt rat in it.
---
Do you mostly go to plex sites in FW space? How long are you online?
---
username checks out
---
&gt;Goons, for example, will shit on Montolio for being crazy. Despite the fact that most of us in leadership at the time (though a bit split, admittedly) felt like he was right. It's all a matter of perspective.
---
When step 1 of your plan to start a bloc war is to disband your own coalition, yeah people are going to ask about substance abuse or recent concussions.
---
we are working on the video as i type - it will be uploaded to youtube when completed - along with match commentary
---
&gt;You'r basically wanting changes that will kill off whaling, make it more efficient for miners to not use the ships you want to kill, make it more efficient for miners to use ships that can get off grid faster and avoid you all together, your basically asking for changes that are going to kill your own playstyle.
---
As opposed to what ? Continue with the status quo and remain on path to becoming Serenity 2.0 ? Will that not kill everyones playstyle his and yours and every other other one except bots altogether ? Killing a single or even two playstyles is a far lesser price to pay then killing all of them.
---
A Cross-site scripting (XSS) exploit is where you abuse some oversight in an otherwise trusted website to get another user's web browser to execute your javascript code when they browse that website, usually to do stuff like steal data/cookies/etc.
---
If you've heard of the [samy worm that got some guy millions of friends on myspace years back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtnuaHl378M) that was a really basic XSS exploit.
---
Rax is implying Mittani or someone in his spy network could "just" (highly illegally) abuse an XSS exploit in Discord to scrape peoples chat histories (also extremely illegal).
---
When seconds count navigating menus can be an unacceptable delay.
---
It does do well in null also. Suitonia has been using it lately on stream and Asilthar posted a video of his harassing of Pandemic Horde around BWF recently.
---
But the autocannon fit is better suited to null sec.

The number of bosons seems right
---
I had someone a few weeks ago sell plex to me via buy order for about 1/4 the going rate due to their fumble fingers or drunk. Sure they learned a hard lesson I hope, same as your buyer did.
---
Combat interceptors are still nullified, you should definitely haul any valuables you have through null with them.
---
Agreed, but plenty of other places where mistakes can and will continue being made. 
---
I'm not a fan uf dumbing down this game. Could argue that even from a sci-fi immersion perspective you'd think that so far in the future capsuleers have developed more efficient ways of doing things.
---
Have an upvote OP. I laughed out loud.
---
&gt;And when they find out they can talk here in the subreddit
---
Add to that finding out that like half of them, if not more, use VPNs other then the approved ones.
---
They've already made skills to reduce the timer. Why not jack the timer down to 99% reduction
---
rorq pilots everywhere instanly hate you
---
yep
---
thanks
---
I can’t believe I have to say this on r/Eve 
---
It was a shit post. XSS, SQL injection, or any of those other “hacker things” you hear about are indeed very illegal and will get you prison time if you try to do it on unauthorized systems. (Pretty much everything.) 
---
Pro tip, if anyone thinks penetration testing is cool, there are websites that allow you test of them, or even virtual machines that you can download to your own PC that are made for you to explicitly try to crack open. 
---
Don’t try them on any website/system you don’t have clear was day permission to do so. It’s bad mmmkay

humor me... would you rather cook or earn x more $$$ working that additional hours that you spend cooking, most people pick that and get takeout/got to cafes etc especially when they earn far more than minimal wage...
---
You can download the maps.
---
nobody was wondering, because it says that right there in the title
---
That's why I think Abyssal Deadspace is an amazing testing ground for new rat brains. You have a few people who can multi-box them, but it takes some serious focus and thought to get through the sites unlike orbitting a forsaken hub. The threat priority, the fact that the battleships will fly you all the way to the edge of the pocket and force you to pay attention to where you fly, they may be "safe" and "solved" PvE, but it still requires your focus to safely complete.
---
Imagine if, warping to a Haven, you know, the place where tons of these criminals hide out to plot crimes and what not, undocked sabres and bubbled the shit out of site to try and keep the aggressor on site to kill. Just making the sites more engaging would be a benefit to me, and would make botting harder and less safe.
---
In a sentence that also explains why many of the supposed 10,000 new players every week don't stick with this game. I also kept at it for the same reasons.
---
 Congrats sam :)
---
O shit fam never noticed there's a top 100. I'm #33, right behind wheniaminspace, whose dank vids were the reason I moved to null and started flying Thrasher. https://i.imgur.com/XgbcC4i.png

Clones n stuff are all on brain in a box.. Altho they can queue commands instead of pushing it all to brain immediately. 
---
Like with skill queues. You have to remove or add them all individually and every time it pings brain and ask it if its cool instead of gathering up the changes and making it all at once.  Its very annoying.
---
Altho the amount of session timers is getting a bit much.. Its even worse when you think youve changed clones or ships and try and undock and end up joining fleet in a pod.. Thanks ccp.. Fucking session timers.
---
Looks like the old ombeve maps

the song is from the avengers infinity war trailer so I bet there are a couple more like these out there. nice vid anyway.

isn't that what this post is about? literally asking how people fill their newly found spare time after quitting? or do I need to spoon feed you this tldr?
---
&gt;And maybe, just maybe, we could give Rooks and Kings back to you guys.
---
Dude, I used to hold a great deal of respect for R&amp;K, lost quite a few ships and pods to your smartbombs alone, unfortunately I lost it once it has thrown in with the status quo. This game really needs entities that work on the old R&amp;L premise of "fight with less and win" instead of n+1. But I am just not sure if that is possible anymore due to game and mechanics changes.
---
You guys were an inspiration for a lot of small and mid size corps that have now almost disappeared from the game entirely, except mainly WH and HS regions. Even LS has gone to shit blobs and caps now. Game really needs less blobs and return of all those small entities to become alive and organic again and that means some really drastic changes which will never happen because of krab meta screeching and GSF controlled CSM.
---
Bubbles and hictor rats my man
---
yep really good song, both nice vids btw
---
Make rorqual drones latch onto asteroids and drill, they cant be pulled back until their 1m drilling timer is up and they have no shields while drilling.
---
What's a BSB?
---
That doesn't fix the problem. The problem is that I have like 5 different implant sets. When I want to change them (when I change ships) I have to...
---
1.  Undock
---
1.  Dock in structure with correct pod
---
1.  Leave ship
---
1.  Jump into correct pod
---
1.  Get back into ship
---
That is 6 session changes I have to wait for just to switch pods.
---
&gt;It's not tho? And with the war with frat its becoming more fun for me at least.
---
Are_you_sure_about_that.gif just wait until the Chinese fully migrate to TQ and end up either blueing goons or getting absorbed you'll end up with 80% of the game population literally jacking each other off, doing nothing but feeding RMT machines and mining 23/7, organizing occasional mini conflicts that don't matter and hold no value whatsoever to either side...
---
Get over yourself, it's a fucking game asswipe, you're letting it destroy your life. There is no reason for you to have quit the game, then come on here and post how shit it is and how you're feeling so much better other then to try and seek out attention. Clearly it has worked out for you.
---
I understand why you see the suggestion as "make krabbing less safe", and it's more or less what the author of the post wants to convey, but I personally look forward to "make krabbing less predictable". That part might hurt player's assets, but it would stimulate their interest and keep the game more entertaining.

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system.

---
Is there a way to see all time solo kill ranking?
---
[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) Please, for next time.
---
I had failed trying solo pvp. Wanna come back to Eve so bad but never had much direction. This is inspiring though, especially since Thrasher was my favorite ship.
---
Thanks think I see what you mean now. Found the below in the github error submissions. I will try it.
---
"Please read release notes regarding it:
---
https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/releases/tag/v2.9.1
---
"Change Charge (All)" menu item has been removed, use regular charge switcher with Ctrl key pressed instead
---
Added option to "General" section which controls behavior of ammo switcher. By default it is set to change ammo just for selection without Ctrl and for all modules with Ctrl"
---
as far as I can tell rats have pretty basic aggro tables and ewar is pretty good at jumping to the top of the list, especially since most invading players activate a scram, web, neut, and/or guns in a single tick.  And as said looks like there's some random switching in there too, but I'd guess a ship that warps in and does nothing takes a while for that to happen, but it's been a long time since I've had two ships in a site.
---
https://obsproject.com
---
This is what it looks like when you truly win EVE
---
Yes, because we need more power creep in EVE. /s
---
Go fuck yourself, blah blah. 
---
Next.
---
EVE is pretty
---
Weak argument tbh.
---
New player, 4 months old, haven't done a fraction of this, probably because I suck.
---
AMA
---
that only works for the diamond rats, anom rats do not respect standings.
---
So make a tower or something with lots of hp to hic point you.  The hic point would go down when the site is done or the player grinds through the tower hp.  It would make the player choose between max ticks by skipping the tower or more safety by killing the tower first.
---
Ok, ty for the info.
---
Please consume the content I create (feeding)
---
can't see this, can you mail me the vhs?
---
Random tangent, but IMO not giving keepstars a jump drive was a missed opportunity for content.
---
They should have made their construction require a capital system with fully maxed indexes and custom IHUB upgrades, and then allowed them to be moved a certain number of lightyears every few days, subject to the deployment and 12+ hour protection of a deployable cyno beacon.
---
So rather than a keepstar appearing on the front lines with one battle, it would have been a staged deployment, a massive moving battle fortress edging its way forward over time providing ample opportunity for counter-attack.
---
The things you do to kill time during a structure bash...
---
ditch the Intel channels - local is good enough to know what's going on. don't bother being on comms either, too much hassle. just pick a haven and boson away
---
the less right click menu shit the better. we can see bms in space, having them on overview is a good next step
---
shining because of bosons :)
---
I've seen worse in highsec near jita.
---
A procurer is a better bet for solo mining with code around. It fits a ridiculous buffer tank that they won't be able to Gank before being Concorded and can put out a fair amount of dps if needed.
---
Yes i am. And dooming and glooming about it makes you miserable and unable to enjoy what is there to enjoy.
---
a modified version of the the scatter can mechanic could even be used for this, just with the rocks lasting a bit longer
---
As number 1 Vigil pilot a few months ago I salute you!
---
Any algos tips?
---
Could easily make the colours customisable, as they are currently. For instance I have no standings set to yellow so they pop out on my overview better, and I can use neutral as a tag while hunting. 
---
I'd love to be able to set unique colours for individuals when hunting, it's really awkward to have the choice of only red/orange/neutral as the first two are used frequently in alliance/corp standings, leaving only one viable option. It'd be nice to be able to differentiate between titan pilots, blingy ratters, cyno alts, etc using just local/overview colours.
---
Probably because I'm not trying to argue anything
---
I would rather remove all standings other than purple (fleet member).
---
Not to mention clone bays have the second lowest fuel cost of all structure service modules.

I just got the game a day ago. I really want to get into it because the dynamics of this game fascinate me, but none of my friends are enthusiastic to play a non shooter type game. Anyone that I can enter a discord or type of group with that does not have a problem with a noob tagging along and learning?
---
 I mean I can't disagree there
---
Races have no impact
---
They would have to remove the ability for Super caps and Titans to dock at them then because then they would just become an oversized ship hauler or make it so that the ship could not move whilst the Titans and sup caps we're docked. That would be op
---
You can fly any race even as caldari - as an alpha you are just limited by tech and skill points. All races have something to provide in most eve contexts, so you are good with any of them when you start off.
---
You won't be too limited by race since you're learning the game, and you can quickly train other races early on
---
If corvette you said refers to rookie ship as we used to call them, no, they are equally useless across four races, well, less for Velator but not significantly better than others.
---
Your starting empire means almost nothing except for character appearance and starting system so pick whatever you like

Easier? Its basic UI change not a balance patch.
---
why?
---
This is why I somehow love this community.
---
I could almost imagine The Judge inching our assets toward delve one jump at a time. Meanwhile convincing us we are on the offensive or something.
---
Just look at his loses.
---
I disagree, the old mining system was good only for people with a lot of accounts.
---
If you only have a couple (perfect balance for normal players) you can do almost nothing except really small stuff.
---
Rorqual mining was a great idea imho because it gave the opportunity to almost everyone to try serious mining and industrial things.
---
Same problem with all the other capitals and also supers, the problem is the excessive proliferation, not the ship.
---
Reduce ship abilities is the wrong answer, CCP should work towards reducing the number of characters able to fly them.
---
How? 
---
- turn injected skill points back into injectors and give a free remap for remaining skill points
---
- make injectors usable only to characters with less than 5M SP
---
Results:
---
- huge reduction of capital pilots to almost pre injectors era
---
- huge drop on injectors prices that will help newbros and alphas
---
- huge reduction (if not erase at all) of characters created only for botting or AFK krabbing (new chars specifically injected for rorq mining, super ratting, bots etc etc...)
---
- huge reduction on resources that will raise ore and capital prices to normal
---
It's not hard, it require only that CCP will do unpopular things to save the game.
---
They must choose between continue on this path (have a small revenue today pushing on plexes and destroy the game in the small/medium period and lost everything) or change the route removing the worst decision ever made on this game (injectors), this will give less money in the small period and let the game survive and continue for many many years.

at start i was dying really a lot, dying 20 times and killing 0, sometimes 1 people per day, i got discouraged a lot but on my corp chat and on the channel "Bringing solo back" people were asking me what i was doing during fight, this way they helped me analyze every death to understand what i was doing wrong until i improved enough for this little achievement. at start you simply ask yourself why you're not winning, then you start to see the point on why you're not winning
---
the experienced you get on pvp and the more you understand what you can engage, it's also true that you have to engage everything at start to understand things on each ship you encounter.
---
solo pvp is beautiful, not today tho, i died 7 or 8 times in a row now ahah, gotta focus more, see you around
---
i'd suggest you to go for 7 280 howitzer if you can, i can only fit 6 of them because of lack of pg and cpu so i sorted it out using 7 250
---
also if you can maybe go for tech 2 rigs, i just make it cheap because i still think im in the process of learning and want to make it as cheap as possible

Thanks a lot! See you in space capsuleer.
---
Really? That doesn't make sense.
---
Thanks!!
---
For your catch all skills, look up 'the magic 14' that should keep you busy :)
---
Damn, I miss wheniaminspace :(
---
Thanks for the info. It just seems so much has changed in the past few years and I’m just looking for a little direction. Appreciate the help!
---
Lets be honest, r/eve just wants to buff hunting and nerf defending
---
Have you tried asking your FC?
---
Start with what will hold you down and impede you. Tackle and ewar are detrimental in the long run to just set aside. And understand your fleet. If you're a fast moving kitey type of doctrine, get that huginn/rapier/loki off grid asap. Are you more cap heavy? Focus on getting the bhaal off grid. Etc.
---
You'll also want to pressure their logi if they have some. Although with logi you will have to coordinate to switch targets at the same time so that everyone's alpha can quickly eat through before reps arrive.
---
I'm by no means an experienced FC, I'm still learning (just like you :)). You'll be making mistakes and all, but that's the best way to learn.
---
Disclaimer: I am not an fc take what I say with a grain of salt
---
From what I’ve heard and the experiences that I’ve had in fleets, you want to target dps ships first and see if you can break them. If you cannot break them due to Logi, go after the Logi, kill a few, then go back to trying to kill dps. If you still cannot kill dps, repeat the process.
---
There’s a lot of content to sift through. I was just looking for some guidance.
---
why
---
yes i mostly go to plexes, but i enjoy more open fights, they are way better, i like chasing down a target. btw i work from home so im usually online
---
Do you have a link?
---
i dont think we should be sorry for that to be honest, not everyone has the focus to stay behind eve, most people rather prefer to stick with faster games and it's totally understandable
---
What other, newer voice chat client has the level of customization and utility as Mumble?
---
Yes, had a good chat with him. But there isn't just one way to FC, he is fairly new to it himself. Always good to get more than one opinion
---
:)
---
hey sorry mate, indeed Kaasumi is the one that has helped me the most tbh, but i dont know why i forgot about him, i guess it's also because i dont read him that much on the bsb chat, my memory also sucks and im forgetting more for sure
---
thanks sir!!

If your bookmarks are in a folder you can drag that folder out of the people and places window to create a new window with just that folder's bookmarks.

Not what I meant. Though we do this anyways... Who doesn't?

A crab with a cyno where its heart should be, perfect representation of delve.
---
I mean, you could try krabbing in Esoteria. Also not safe.
---
Dont do it alone. 
---
Focus on one thing, and then get backseat FCs to do other things. 
---
So for example if youre the main FC, you can be anchor for your fleet which means that you control the group's movement in space, you decide when to engage and disengage, when to cycle boosts, and when to be bubbled by your own dictors. 
---
While youre doing that, you have other FCs (backseat) do other things, such as call targets, scout around you (so you dont get bombed), creating pings if youre trying to pull some scheme off, scanning, or doing anything else you need done that you dont want to divide your attention over. 
---
It is possible to everything yourself, i have see a couple of people pull it off and be successful, but i personally cant and never could, it is just too stressful, and i would make mistakes all the time.
---
They just need to make it where mining feels better. Feels less like a waste of time grinding so you can buy your next injector. Make it a mini game, let the good, attentive single pilots reap the reward for playing the game right. Make it rewarding. And just nerf the 20+ rorqual spam. Make it still viable but just barely.
---
&gt; If you’ve ever tried to run more than 2-3 accounts you’d see it right away, its a nightmare.
---
i have - it's not. for an activity like mining it's very easy and very desirable to scale in a linear fashion.

2nd worst logi pilot tri ever had !

This is a legit question. As a pvp beginner i struggle to find right encounters too.
---
I either end up getting blown by something way stronger or by a blob.
---
well i posted it on mobile ^^
---
Even max skilled you're probably going to need implants if I remember correctly.  For a long time I went with web, point, and sebo.  That reduces the fit significantly.  You have no prop which people will scoff at, but it is a really good fit if you know how to strategically warp.
---
&gt;While this was happening Higher Then Everest was camping 2 jumps over and picking off anyone who warped directly to the 46dp gate in T6GY in a non-nullified ship, I guess they are alergic to tidi which I can definitely understand.
---
tbf 5 dudes picking off reinforcements/reships is infinitely more useful than +1% f1 numbers
---
This. I have zero coordination and it's worse if the shakes start.
---
I just wish that when updating an order, it wouldn't take into account only the price that Eve thinks the item is worth (which is sometimes way off), but also the price you were already selling it at. Changing an order by 0.02 isk should not trigger an "are you sure?" warning, regardless of the actual price of the item.
---
Depending on what type of fleet your running honestly.       
---
If its a  strategic/objective based fight:       
---
Target logi or support based ships like Huginns/lachs.      
---
Target DPS if your scoring kills despite their logi.      
---
Target tackle to disengage.      
---
If is a random roam/welp fleet:      
---
Target highest value first.       
---
Target Ewar first.      
---
Target weakest tank first.      
---
Knowing what strategy to use and when to use it is always going to be the hardest thing to learn.
---
Yeah no kidding.
---
The bullshit is that you pop into local before you even fucking load grid.
---
sort your overview by distance (closest at the top) so you aren't calling targets outside of your gang's ability to kill them
---
Yeah I'm just *oozing* with machismo telling people to *learn to cook* because that's a super masculine activity and shit. Sick burn bro
---
Proof if ever it were needed that it's never too late to start playing Eve.
---
So a logged in bot that is scraping intel and local channels is not directly interacting with the game?
---
shoot all the things, all the time
---
But no other game can offer me 5+ hours of content devoid solo roam in a brawler frig so I can be killed by a 20-man fleet gate-camping jackdaws.
---
yawn ..everyone drum rolling on injectors ..when ppl speculated it almost 4 yrs ago ... so many posts .. . STOP allowing injectors into capitals .. ppl be like "injectors dont give  you skill to fly the ships so its ok" . here we are at inflation point and ppl are beginning to realize the various problems. Pathetic, so short sighted and shows the lvl of IQ . Instead of suggesting unrealistic stuff like " make injected skill points back to injectors" get real and deal with it . Its like saying to an invading army " can you pls go back i did not see you coming " i want to die another day .
---
Often there are player corporations that will recruit around the starting hubs. If you want people that are willing to be super helpful they aren’t a bad start. There is also a help channel in the chat, it a little bit of a crap shoot but is still a good resource.
---
‘Library’ would probably be the better term
---
Init were not third partying this. After killing a a frat rorqual and some subs FRAT offered this fight to Init and we accepted to come and help winter co as a one off. No idea about it. But we were there so we came and had some fun.
---
&gt; I'd say something like not being able to extract SP before a character is 4-5 months old
---
This is actually a pretty good idea, I would take it a step further and make 2FA mandatory for at least the first time extraction, or until logged off (so per session), in order to help out with accounts that get hacked and stripped of SP in addition to helping out with botting.
---
I know RTF's CEO very well. If he is in that corp he pvps as his primary activity or he's not in RTF, period, full stop. If he pvps I dont give a droplet of piss in the wind what you think about his stream. Talk to CCP.
---
All you need to know is that you need to go back , and don't play eve
---
&gt;Lets be honest,   
---
&gt;r/eve  
---
&gt; just wants to buff hunting and nerf defending
---
As opposed to what ? Further slipping down the path of Serenity 2.0 ? We are almost at the precipice and what happens or doesn't happen in near future will determine where and how this game will end up with. Do you really honestly want to end up like that ?
---
Webs ships &gt; links &gt; logi if you cant break dps ships  or dps ships if you can break them then logi. depending on fleet comp you should either take out tackle first or have a dedicated anti support for this job (e.g. rlml cerb)
---
But remember; a bad target is better than no target
---
Heh, in no way am I advocating for more wormholes, just saying that's how you get around the gate activation letting a hypothetical sentry bot know you're in system. The guy above me in comments who suggests not appearing in local until you decloak has a much better idea.
---
What a fun brawly fight 👍
---
It makes sense if you have an understanding of history. The diamond NPCs were deployed to test an experimental new AI.
---
You must be playing in delve
---
It's good for wormholers so of course they won't add it.
---
A single dude used to terrorize null ratters in an auto thrasher.  Look into wheniaminspace
---
He finds mostly wrong encounters, look at his board.
---
To answer your question, go to fac war and find a system that isn't super active.  Learn to Dscan.  
---
And then tell CCP to do ANYTHING about fac war because it's the most readily available content in the game to people of all skill levels and for some reason they've ignored it entirely for a decade.
---
I will change it, might not be able to figure out how to strike out the original so sorry if the edit makes you look a little deranged.
---
You might get upvoted more if you don't insist on sounding like a condescending prick.
---
Some activities just take practice. Take on that role of junior FC, back seat during fleets, take out some small gang roams in cheap frigates or destroyers and start calling shots.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76446862/
---
Yeah. While on paper Rorq mechanics force fights, in practice all it does is make them way the hell too safe to deploy. Compare a Rorq with an equivalent value in exhumers and Orcas, the former is going to get caps formed for it while the latter will just be left to die if it gets dropped.
---
Username checks out
---
...to win it.
---
No
---
&gt;We do need teamwork anomalies.
---
How to make them real teamwork instead of multibox cancer though ? 
---
I think it'd be better to have T5 Abyss style soloable but difficult encounters and mechanics and AI, for example, from the moment rats notice a hostile in their anom a timer starts ticking, you don't complete the instance in time rats disappear and there would be no bounties but instead you have to pick up or interact with objective upon defeating final rat or boss of some sort.
---
You could expand on it much more, for example after defeating the rats, make it so you have to interact with a can or object and either salvage or hack it or whatever for a minute or so, not just get bounties automatically transferred into your account. Or how about you have to loot something of off regular rats you kill then turn it in at the objective in order to obtain the main reward.
---
There is a ton of stuff that can be done, unfortunately it just simply isn't because of CCPs lack of willingness and short sightedness.
---
&gt;I don't know how you go about deciding what to shoot first, when to switch target, jamming etc.. 
---
So I usually try to run by a few primary tasks:
---
* 1 - Try to prioritize targets before an engagement. Even if you are not the FC (especially if you are backup), try to get a handle on what you are about to face. Good communication and understanding with your scouts can really help here, an FC as a scout usually knows when to mention some specifics. It also helps to know in advance so you can set up some overview tabs with priority targets in advance.
---
* 2.a - Prioritize targets that interfere with your fleet first. Whether they disrupt your ability to fight, or inhibit your ability to stay alive. It can be situational, but typically the latter is more important. For example if you are a kiting or dig-tanking doctrine, enemy Huginns and Rapiers may be more of a threat than falcons or DPS. Killing tackle is somewhat situational. If they can’t hit you, a non-scramming interceptor or dictor isn’t much of threat. Also keep in mind that headshotting enemy FCs May be effective, but also can end an engagement pretty quickly. If you want maximum fun I don’t recommend doing it. Also e-bushido dictates that is bad form. Don’t forget, fighters and drones can also be targets if you can properly apply damage to them. Often with carriers, the fighters are much easier to kill than the carrier itself.
---
* 2.b - Second priority will usually be any support ships that help the enemy survive. Links and logistics are the usual targets. However, it is not always necessary to prioritize these ships if you can kill DPS easily enough. For example, if you are an alpha doctrine, it may not even be necessary to kill support if you aren’t having trouble killing DPS.
---
* 2.c - Always work downwards on the list above. If you can’t kill the priority, work on something else in the mean time. You want to try and kill as much as possible over time. If you can’t kill recons, links, or logistics, it’s ok to just take the low-hanging fruit like tackle while you maneuver.
---
* 3 - Always try to keep a backlog of targets to keep friendly weapons active. You may not broadcast them all at once, but sometimes you won’t be able to hit or kill a priority target. Having a continuous and orderly stream of targets reduces any downtime and maximizes your damage output. 
---
* 4.a - Avoid Analysis Paralysis. If things are dying quickly or just moving at a fast pace, don’t freeze. Just pick something to shoot and then do some more quality target selection as time allows. Sometimes quick orders are better than no orders. On the flip side, you do not have to work targets at an absolute breakneck pace. Just go as fast as you can reasonably handle at any given point. 
---
* 4.b - Keep in mind your pacing and the coordination of your fleet. If you broadcast too many targets or are seeing wide-splits of dps, feel free to reset everyone and have them break all locks and start fresh. Slowing your pace can also help prevent your fleet from becoming disorganized quickly if there are fewer active locks going on. It can be pretty hard to split dps if only one target is broadcast at a time, so balance that with the speed you can kill.
---
* 5 - Try to balance the difficulty of a kill with its payoff. For example a HAC and a T1 BC May have similar damage outputs, but the BC is likely going to be the easier one to kill, so focus fire on that one first. 
---
/
---
While that may sound like a mouthful to remember quickly, none of these suggestions are ever really hard rules. They’re just ways to make your target-calling more effective. Don’t get too caught up trying to offer the absolute best targets at all times.
---
Yeah. So much BS with nerfing the tank and the PANIC making the damn thing essentially useless without a super umbrella (and twice as useless in wormholes) when all CCP needed to do was nerf Excavators into the ground.
---
Unpopular opinion here, but the Rorq should not be able to mine enough to overcome the cost of running the I-Core, or should only just barely be able to do so. It should be a pure support vessel with a shedload of tank and the ability to hold its own until the cavalry arrives.
---
The real problem is that EVE is a relatively niche game and it has little name recognition outside of the people who are already in that niche. Literally just advertising the game more and creating more content for it (*cough* Scope *cough*) would go a long way towards reversing that decline and making the game healthier overall. If it keeps bleeding real players then it's going to get locked in a downward spiral.

Might as well get rid of overview entirely, gotta click on shit in space directly first! Lol
---
Thank you for your input. 😂

Hey I didnt know about this shit. Changes my opiniom of him. He already likes to mine my moon without a tip as is lol.
---
You dont have to be a jackass about someone informing other people. This is not common knowledge and if it was I doubt he would have that high viewership in the first place.
---
&gt;I don't know of any rat that scram. Maybe in burners, not in anoms.
---
Burners, some DED sites and Abyss rats scram
---
it's only unpopular because the proliferation of the ship means that 95% of active subscribed accounts would become essentially useless as you'd never need more than 1-3 rorquals per mining operation unlike now where every ship is a rorqual.
---
the issue with the rorqual is that it's the very best ship at every aspect of mining. which makes every other mining ship in the game irrelevant and pointless.
---
Join a corp. Even new player corp. So u cam ask questioms and grasp game faster.
---
&gt;If you’ve ever tried to run more than 2-3 accounts you’d see it right away, its a nightmare.
---
I regularly run five Ventures gas mining at once. I can make upwards of 100Mn ISK per hour per account with little to no risk. It is so much bullshit and Venture gas mining needs to be nerfed into the ground.
---
While it may be hard to multibox some PvE content, it is incredibly easy to multibox most mining content.
---
&gt;no shared inventory or wallets
---
This is incredibly easy to deal with. Either put all your accounts into a corp you own with a 100% tax rate or just trade between them when you need something.
---
Init to win it....
---
Never heard that one before...
---
That would unironically fix most of what is wrong with multibox mining.
---
I like how we have all these well thought out solutions to a significant problem and CCP is just going to ignore the fuck out of it.
---
Feels good knowing your game's developer doesn't even care.
---
I love the idea for turning things in, like collecting random loot and some random NPC Corp posts a buy order in a random HS system for 50MN Restrained Microwarp Drives for 20x thier Jita buy price, or Medium Restrain Shield Extender for 10x the Jita sell price. It will inflate value to random modules.
---
Also, the final boss idea, make it three enemies that run from each other and circle around one guy and hammers him with 1100 dps and does the racial ewar within 35-40 km and changes targets ever 90 seconds to stop VNI and Ishtar Pilots from being OP. Make them AB fit so they break tracking, make them move 700-2000 m/s depending on size. So you have to have a guy doing tackle, you have to have 2-3 guys hammering it. If you dont take it down fast enough the others get close enough to rep it. And then scatter again
---
Doesn't matter, the narrative is always how people spin it!
---
Dont. The only ship better for huffing is a prospect then venture. You need like 8 huffers to equal a venture and no ore bay.. So just dont.. Its worth more to lose the venture and try again than lose a battlecruiser and the time spent hauling.
---
Too late
---
I eagerly await the ability to make every corp chat read like [Niles and Frasier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGA8z3ycKcE).
---
Not Teal Shoot It
---
... but this one is aquamarine? No wait, it's fecal brown...
---
Tbh they just need to make the default ones less bad
---
&gt;You are talking about solving the safety issue. The very reason why Eve krabbing is extremely safe is that there are lots of motivating factors to band together, particularly Rorquals, so people have banded together and created a few ultra safe regions. Now you are adding one more to the motivations
---
Sorry man, but in this case, this is a small change that would help address some of the symptoms while at the same time addressing a whole otehr issue which you are accidentally ignoring, and that is boring PvE. Boring PvE contributes to botting, AFKing, etc. Making it more engaging and more active  is a good thing all around, take T4 T5 Abyss and Trig ships as an example. These are just simply put much more fun to do and to use.
---
So while it won't solve the problem, it is certainly a step in the right direction from multiple angles. 
---
I would also like to point out that a lot of the stuff you keep on proposing such as addressing cynos etc. is likewise focused on just alleviating symptoms rather then the root cause.
---
If you want to address the root cause then rework the entire way bounties work in the game along with all PvE and the entire CCP business model of concentrating on multi-account whales of all sorts, while at the same time rework the economy so it becomes a lot cheaper to sub then currently and much more expensive to plex to the point that RMT becomes almost unprofitable or returns too little profit for the effort. And GFL with all that. None of it will ever happen due to the whale business model. 
---
It has gotten to the point in the game, that those who are the biggest whales, either collective or single, directly or indirectly can no longer function without AFKing, bots, etc. at the level required to remain competetive. This is the real problem. The root cause.
---
whats there to upvote or downvote in what i said  . if you are going to downvote it , downvote . I am not making an suggesting anything or contradicting what this guy is saying . Its something i want to the say to the guy dreaming about skill injectors . if it sounds like a prick then so be it . at the moment i am jus enjoying the inflation in the game.
---
wtf is that title tho
---
Been there done that.
---
At least now with the nerfs the smaller entities should move back to the Orca.
---
Add the ability to "discover" new systems. Wormhole opens up there; move through and build a gate back to civilization. But not Stain. No. Not there.
---
Performance for who ? The client is responsible for showing the overview.
---
People who don't want losses on their KB, or who think having people who get killed on the corp KB will bring more hostiles to our super secret wormhole mining paradise.
---
I feel like I was never ruthless enough for this game.  My personal values would compel me to give most of it back.
---
Excellent post! Thank you I appreciate it.

not really, the rorq still has the highest mining yield in the game. nothing about the recent nerf addresses anything about the problems other than either lowering your isk/hour slightly, or encouraging you to get a few more accounts (oh surprise, ccp want you to get more accounts)

Removing is a bit heavy handed. Make flight of excavs output what an unbonused hulk does.
---
pirate sites spawn up to c3
---
&gt;Makes Barges the actual afk miners and take rorqs back to their original purpose, buffing but with a reward.
---
So my opinion on this is two-part:
---
1 - There should never have been a single massive mining output ship. It was antithetical to mining from the start and just opens up many negative possibilities. 
---
2 - Mining has always been a low-input, low-reward task. Efficiency in mining should rely more on indirect methods like choosing better locations, finding better ores, and setting up more efficient operations. 
---
Making excavators like Fighters is just a bandaid to the real issue: rorquals mine too much for almost equal (if not lower) levels of input. CCP tried to balance this by simply making it a more risky isk investment. The biggest problem with that thinking is that once you can effectively and regularly mitigate that risk, then what you’re left with is just plain OP.
---
that's already a thing - they're called miner IIs.
---
&gt;I love the idea for turning things in, like collecting random loot and some random NPC Corp posts a buy order in a random HS system for 50MN Restrained Microwarp Drives for 20x thier Jita buy price, or Medium Restrain Shield Extender for 10x the Jita sell price. It will inflate value to random modules.  
---
&gt;Also, the final boss idea, make it three enemies that run from each other and circle around one guy and hammers him with 1100 dps and does the racial ewar within 35-40 km and changes targets ever 90 seconds to stop VNI and Ishtar Pilots from being OP. Make them AB fit so they break tracking, make them move 700-2000 m/s depending on size. So you have to have a guy doing tackle, you have to have 2-3 guys hammering it. If you dont take it down fast enough the others get close enough to rep it. And then scatter again.  
---
&gt;Edit: More idea. The guys each drop 1-2 random idk tokens to turn-in  in HS. Like you are guaranteed 30 mil in a site but it could randomly become 35, 40 and a max of 100 at a 1in300 chance with a fraction rat spawn being the only one to drop that much. Adds an element of risk to ratters. "My hauler got ganked in HS so I lost our 5 bill in tokens :(" would also cause a lot of fatter drama and less trash because you would absolutely have to have loot.
---
I don't think it should be regular loot to bring up gamewide market prices, CCP already partially does that at the bottom line to make sure loot doesn't fall below certain bare minimums via NPC buy orders. It could be something like tags or overseers thingies or trig data sheets that we already have in the game. They could further tie these into rat types that are dominant per region, and thus control income / regulate ingame economy simply by adjusting individual looted items.
---
For the boss idea, sure, there could be lots of different ones, in fact there should be because if its just the same thing over and over again it will get stale and boring. Could even have Abyss style spawn / AI / tactic variation for final boss spawns. That would make thing much more interesting.
---
Having to loot would also change peoples fits and tactics. Many ships that are currently used for ratting would become too slow and impractical for it. Sure, you could complete the content and kill everything easier, but then you would get less reward per time spent in it. Which woudl actually be great as it would shift things in the whole risk vs rewards scheme more towards where they need to be.
---
In a default Corp atm, and that is less than helpful as we all know.
---
Thanks for the encouragement!
---
Good job I'm a Brit then :)
---
Channel "bringing solo back" - someone will take you under theirr wing, although advice/encouragement is abundant from many in there.
---
Samuelle was and still is determined to get better, sometimes it feels like one out of every 10 messages in there is him asking another question. 
---
He would often post a loss mail and just ask what the hell he did wrong. He quickly learnt what to engage and what not to. Worth mentioning that to begin with he was engaging each and every target coming his way. Your first days pvping that is prob a good idea.
---
But like he said, get ready to lose many ships. You will be lucky to get a kill for every 20 losses. 
---
It was cool seeing him progress though and more killmails over the past month.
---
Perfect example that its not about the skillpoints in this game. It's experience and determination that make you a better pvper.
---
&gt; it's going to get locked in a downward spiral.
---
It already is on downward spiral, but not quite locked beyond point of no return yet, but that point is not too far off.
---
Don't forget your 6th drone.
---
Thank you for posting this lovely picture of our home. 
---
For those who don’t know Krab Nebula (delve) is a beautiful accepting place where bears and krabs coexist peacefully to create a society with simple rules like get more titans..... and get more fax alts.
---
&gt;Abysmal space.   Its setup to only allow one account in.
---
Ummm, frig Abyss is 3 accounts and yields better rewards then the solo cruiser Abyss.
---
&gt; If you’ve ever tried to run more than 2-3 accounts you’d see it right away, its a nightmare. 
---
I have. Though not recently, and I disagree with you entirely, and since I have there have been a whole bunch of improvements made to support better multiboxing then there was in the past.
---
Can I fly with you? I could be in a talwar shooting pesky slashers...
---
Suck you may do, but so did Samuelle 1 month ago, still does,but so did we all. 
---
The end game in EVE very few people reach. I personally still feel like I suck. But you are always improving/learning.
---
Buy 100-200 ships. Dont try and fly everything under the sun, just pick one ship like he has with Thrasher and just fly the fuck out of it, till you learn it inside out. 
---
Be prepared to lose, a lot, and you will get better. You cant do it alone though. Just join "bringing solo back" channel and post your losses in there. We will break apart your fits, give advice, give you a hard time when you clearly fucked up or engaged a ship you never stood a chance of winning against etc. and help you get better.
---
Fixing the should be your first step, what are you into?
---
Then why are there no bots in wormholes? :)

We killed a poor dude twice as he tried to bring fresh link Lokis to the Tapi eagle fleet. Poor chap was really trying to be the hero tapi needed.

To clarify, I'm not trying to make it so the NPCs kill the krabbers, I'm just suggesting that the NPCs hold the krabbers in the site for longer so that it reduces (but doesn't totally eliminate) the odds that they warp off to a citadel when a roaming hostile comes through.
---
It's a balancing act between increasing the number of VNIs who get caught by solo/small gang roams without making it happen so often that players stop using VNIs in anoms or make it standard practice to cyno in a super for defense.

Isn't using server's to run eve accounts against the rules.

sorry i prefer solo to be honest, but my corp is great and we have small fleets going on every day, we have strong guys here, i dont feel like i can do names because they really rock and i dont want to pick one above the others. i strongly suggest you it, if you may be interested shoot me a message on eve, Samuele KLLSM

Why stop at just more warp disruptors? Make interdictor rats do bubble runs on citadels, heavy interdictor rats that can trap bosoning titans by spawning at randomized spots

So tech. (the term for that)

Hint: I'm not flairbaiting :-)
---
what ? A proof of that ?
---
I can also get a random characteristic of eve and say it's the reason for people not sticking to the game.
---
IMO it's more the lack of fun for beginners that prevent them from sticking. and later the lack of fun from farming.
---
exactly, and it always goes to shit when I show a full overview in potato-mode scale battles. maybe multiple visible tabs would hurt even more.
---
Myself and a couple of my corp mates will be there. We wish to pay respects and honor the memory of the fallen.
---
next time, try this same exact full overview with "disable brackets" on. The overview is not what consumes CPU in my experiences, the brackets are.
---
they divorced because he cheated on her with a vampire larper
---
Cheers mate and yeh is sick to see how far you have came since you started out looking forward to the future :)
---
You I g to homi :)
---
It's still recoverable if CCP actually puts the effort in to create some name recognition, and increases the number of starting skillpoints.
---
Jesus I need to start building Eagles...
---
Just touching tips?
---
agree, though a full overview does also have some impact.  I've fiddled with the settings etc.. a lot :)
---
Ive been thinking about fits, isnt shield is just OP compared to Armor in terms of solopvp?
---
ASB does not use caps. AAR use caps
---
Shield extenders blows up sig but maintains speed.
---
Armor plates slows you down and be less agile.
---
In a game where who-runs-out-of-caps-first and range control are the crux of solopvp, where is the balance? Can someone tell me any of shield weaknesses in solopvp?
---
"someone bosoned the concord street view ship in delve again"
---
true, all of this, also you want to fly a ship you like, dont think a thrasher is better than other ships, it's actually easily outplayable, i achieved this little achievement with the thrasher but trust me, my losses are double my wins, i know of people that with an atron can crack most ships, me as well of course, simply because they used it a lot and know what to do and what to engage. find a type of fight you like first, brawl/scram kite/kite, then choose a ship for it. also dont be afraid to try other type of fights, at start i was flying an executioner because i wanted to outplay my targets making them not hitting me, but it wasnt working very well and i wasnt having much fun, then i tried the thrasher and i liked it a lot :)
---
nice post

I once set the collateral for a hauling contract to 20 mil instead if 2 bill. Didn't realize it until the guy sent me a Thank you note lol

Looks like cactusjack wrote it !!
---
&gt;25. CCP reserves the right to close, temporarily or permanently, any user’s account without advance notice as we deem necessary. Furthermore, we reserve the right to delete all user accounts or inventory of characters as warranted.
---
26. We reserve the right to ban any user from the game without refund or compensation.  
---
   
---
You should read the ToS some day.  
---
  
---
The Brisc ban was problematic because of the public accusation of breaking a legally binding contract. 
---
They do not need evidence for a simple ban.
---
They honestly should. Would make running 30 of them near impossible

---
I understand, and I am suggesting to take it a step further so that total losses from PvP and PvE combined at the top end highest paying sources are roughly equal to those from T5 Abyss, so about 9-10%.
---
Currently the PvE losses are so minimal they do not account for even a single %, while the PvP losses swing if a region enters an overall large conflict, in regular krabbing time it is only about 2-3 %.
---
So do the scram / web rats, see what happens where the PvP loss average ends up, then make more PvE changes to bring it up to par.
---
Reel it in a little. No one mentioned white knighting.
---
I wonder where you learned some of this?
---
Not trying to snark you like the others, [https://updates.eveonline.com/](https://updates.eveonline.com/).

I was only 9 mil when I left but this helped me catch up, hope its the type of thing you were looking for. If this isn't enough im sure someone in an NPC corp will help you out :) Have fun

Oh I understand it. FW out there is good. Some good groups too. If pvp is your thing you want to try, that's where I'd go. Well it's where I went. You'll have fun, you'll lose a lot of ships learning, but you will still have fun.

I want to try small shop fleet and solo pvp. The only area I haven’t really explored beside giant corps and alliances. Not looking for mandatory stuff because of life requirements.
---
Thanks for the assistance!
---
&gt;Damage caps are the only way to prevent larger groups from just cynoing in a hundread titans and erasing things from existance in a single volley.  
---
&gt;What is it exactly what you don't like about it? If it is the limit I think we could debate where to draw the line for ages, but the concept itself is kind of needed for things to actually not be shittier than they already are.
---
They went way overboard with them though. They need to be lightened up a bit, especially on low structures. They need to be at a level where caps come into play to take out at least the largest structures which is currently not the case, the smaller ones can be kept as sub-cap focused content, except in HS where mechanics need to be altered due to abscence of caps.
---
Then totally check out the link I sent you, at least the corp I’m in seems to be your pace and style.
---
A previous response on this that you might find useful:

---
As to be expected, pbuh.
---
Join eve university corp
---
Have a check box next to bookmark "appear in overview"
---
&gt;  then thats a aprox 36b/hr 
---
Your calculations are way off and impossible. 36 bil / hr = almost 26 tril per month, this would blow up the MERs as it would be more then twice the total output of delve and would be immediately looked into and acted on by CCP. CCP is slow to respond but if something like this showed up on the MERs am willing to bet they'd be on it like flies on shit.
---
If you would like a better estimate, then check out  [https://www.eveonline.com/article/ppsmbz/monthly-economic-report-march-2019](https://www.eveonline.com/article/ppsmbz/monthly-economic-report-march-2019)  then note the regional averages for bounties, resources etc. and track them backwards for a while then graph them out. You will notice at one point a drastic rise. The difference from time before that rise to present is roughly what can be attributed to rise in large scale botting.
---
I'd upvote for visibility, but these calculations and conclusions are too far off.
---
Thanks a lot. This is exactly what I needed.
---
we aim to have them out before the 11th May - but dependent on real life work for all involved...video 1 is with the commentators - so production line has started
---
&gt;There are bots in every alliance and every region of null.
---
Yes. But some much more significant and on much bigger scale then others.
---
Try looking into faction warfare corps.   A great way to learn PvP and a lot of stuff happens with frigates and destroyers which are cheap and fun to fly.
---
Kiki is a dirty whore.   Don't dance with her unless you're gonna use protection.
---
O.o
---
You web them down so that they can warp off more easily ... and you still managed to get solo kills?!?
---
Montolio built a new coalition to start a bloc war. Booda disbanded it.
---
Global notes, reddit-like
---
Why not just switch who warps in first if that's all the sophistication they've got? 
---
I imagine there's more to it.
---
I can't deny that my memory of that sequence is a bit hazy.
---
high sec salt is the highest grade there is
---
Like maybe make their HP less, but giving them much better AI would definitely compensate. Who knows, maybe the new AI they use, if being processed in massive numbers causes too much server load or something, it could just be CCP being lazy and dragging their feet though, probably more likely honestly.
---
Is everyone missing how the music is sync'ed up with the effects? That was rather well done. Bravo!
---
They especially love to web and then shoot the expensive Geckos, those dirty sleeper bastards.
---
The same thing happened to me.
---
Good post. Killing logi is good but sometimes you don't need to (this is more for a really big fleet or if the enemy fleet have very few logi). Don't be afraid to "test" a couple DPS targets first, if you can kill them under logi reps (in a reasonable amount of time) you lower the amount of damage they can do to your fleet which increases your own fleet's survivability. There's a trade off to this though, if they start taking out your DPS their logi can become relevant again as you lower how much damage you can front load and this can come back to bite you. It's one of those things you'll learn to develop a feel for, logi first is almost always a good call. 
---
If you want to extend the battle longer a lot of times you need to practice a bit of FC psychology though. Lots of FCs will leave the battlefield when they hear "we have no logi left" so sometimes it's good to take out around half of them. If you can figure out who the logi anchor is especially leave them alive as they will be in charge of communicating information to the FC about logi and if they are alive it's much more likely the FC will feel like he still has a functioning logi wing. I've extended a ton of fights this way and picked up a lot of danku frankus this way. Part of being a good FC is getting into the mind of your enemy FC because PVP on a fleet level in this game is 99% consensual, sometimes you have to show a little leg to dance.
---
This is why I enjoy the new Abyssal sites so much, even though there is technically "less player to player interaction", I still feel like whenever I go into one my ship and pod are at risk, and once you get to higher levels and even the lower levels, if you don't target prioritize or pilot right, you can actually die to the rats pretty quickly. Even if the isk is lower than ratting, it is so much more engaging for me as a player.
---
because it's easier and safer to bot in empire rental space. my bot can see players in wh local, since the xmpp migration, the code to hide it is entirely client side
---
Had the epiphany the other day.. PI should just be factorio.. A CCP version yea but it should just be factorio 
---
Would make PI fucking interesting lol
---
I wish i had that much free time
---
This happened to me one time when i was selling a dread gurstias light missile launcher for basically pocket change, i got like 1.8b isk for, that was an awesome day.

He didn’t inform anyone of anything, he sperged his heavily biased speculations about someone that isn’t really doing anything wrong. Do some research, Markee is open about his monetization methods in the past but when things started to turn to legal involvement he changed his angle. 
---
Markee is a krab without a doubt but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t create positive content for the eve community as well as help educate other miners and provide them an entry level community to get involved in. As a matter of fact I first heard about him from some industry head I work with so he has some positive influence right?
---
GSOL has been doing shit on the big scale since 2008
---
Never said he didnt but my opinion has changed of him none the less. I thought he was just a cheap skate.. Turns out hes an RMT cheap skate.. Awesome.

---
You sell the bpcs not building from them, meaning you don't have to buy/move materials
---
I didn't know that and stand corrected. Thank you.
---
uwot
---
I'd recommend three RR Nestors instead.
---
The rats will also have the debuf, they will also have the buff.
---
ahh micro.  bots will never be able to do micro.
---
Yes and no. We all wish it would be that easy, but ccp randomly banning people will get public and will effect the playerbase dont think i havent read that but well people like you will just follow whatever rolls their boat. Maybe try to get a bigger picture at some point instead of that small minded crap.
---
Cause we just missed out in a vni in one of those regions, but can't remember exactly where we were
---
False bans are nothing new for CCP, and it has been discussed more than enough in the past weeks.   
---
I can't really take you serious calling me small minded if you walk around with your eyes closed.
---
All i've seen these years is how whiny the EVE player base is, i only wonder how this game has survived all these years with this kind of players, while other games have failed in the same situation.
---
Yeeep. Player skill can counter a whole bunch of IG skills. It's why I laugh when people use skill injectors or sell PLEX for "teh uber shipz" and then lose them immediately. just because you can fly X ship, doesn't mean you should. I'm glad you found a ship that meets your needs and I hope you continue to kick ass.
---
To do next?
---
Do the career agents from your faction to earn some isk, mods and free ships. There are 5 of them. 
---
After that do the Sisters of EVE epic arc for more isk and a nice standing increase to get access to higher level agents. 
---
In the meantime read the EVE Uni webpages for all kinds of information. 
---
After that....you can do what you wish.
---
Yeah it has be discussed for years and will be discussed as long as eve or any other online game is present. And there are dozens of articles because of bans in several games. Its always bad press if you start banning without evidence. Only question is if the publisher gives a fuck. CCP just isnt big enough to ignore that
---
It just needs to be a more active engaged process.
---
You are right sorry thera is a System only accesible through wormholes
---
Abyssal weather affects all entities within, your ships, enemy NPCs and your drones. So for example, NPC in Electrical sites will have a huge EM resist hole.
---
And the reason your drones missed a lot in Dark sites is that turret range penalty also applies on your drones, making them harder to track targets
---
Yep. Think of it as an NPC null system with dynamic gates
---
It also explains why so many Eve people are tech nerds.
---
FYI you can print region maps off of Dotlan.
---
Wait, wait.... you think all the PR lately sorrounding that ban is gonna be *bad* for CCP or EVE? Man you're delusional.
---
I'd write something smart here but I'm happy to keep my enemies dumb. Downvote pls.
---
you dont know how many kills i missed, i just now missed a fed navy comet kill. but yeah, the dual web helps me better, with scram i might die sooner
---
Who’s pando and why do I care
---
A bad call is better than no call
---
only reason i'd use skill injectors are cpu/powergrid/capacitor stuff, this way you have less limitations, i enjoy seeing ehp or dps improved because of skills in queue, wouldnt use skill injector on that
---
If you haven't watched the Clarion Call series by Rooks and Kings i reccomend it. Its got some good FCing to give you an idea. Especially Clarion Call 3.
---
Well, the way I see this war is basically Test/xix trying to kick our asses and pretty much every time having their asses kicked.
---
Ooh didnt know that. I was wondering already why my drones were missing so often. Thanks!
---
God thing we can pick what goes on our overview then.
---
Two parts to this.  
---
Part one is more rats including a higher percentage of both Cruisers and destroyers and frigates need tackle.
---
Part two is a speed especially of frigates needs to be increased if the target is more than x distance away.
---
has that been confirmed anywhere?
---
I like Doom
---
And you think every PR is good PR?  Thats also a bit delusional. Btw i only mentioned the crap from the last week because thats something CCP fucked up big. But having people write about unsubstantiated ban waves because they got reported as bot will have negative impacts.
---
Maybe CCP should have an actual aggro mechanic where they keep track of damage dealt to allies, ewar dealt to allies, and remote repairs to enemies, like the kind that has existed forever.
---
Then please point to when low profile false bans in EVE have made it to the news. The game is 16 years old now so according to your own remarks about how that stuff works you should be able to provide a lot of sources.   
---
And btw yes, bad PR is better than no PR.
---
I hear you need multiple dollars for them.
---
Because people don't let their grievances overcome the joy they get from the game.
---
I mean, how is that any different from the reporting of players in a game like CS:GO where someone's good game sense or overbearing skill could be interpreted as hacks? EvE might benefit from a system like CS:GO's Overwatch (pretty much a "Project Discovery" for bot detection).
---
I really enjoy the convenience of it.
---
Wormholer btw
---
oof the cringe
---
One change rorquals need.  Give them two different indy cores.  One for boosts and compression.  One for drones yield.
---
You like turning words around dont you? My first post said that ccp does have to look into reports and doesnt just ban at free will.  Even giving people often second chances. But well I am done here. No point in arguing any further. Yes ccp can ban who they want but that doesnt make it as simple as just baning every person who gets reported. Good night Sir.
---
Better to move to the new site if you have more sites than you can do. If it's your home wh maybe you want to get all the money from your sites.
---
If you get a passive rattlesnake and 4-5 polarized dps ships (oracles, bombers, drakevac mb?) you can do it on the side. 3xtinker rattles + 1x passive rattle + 5 bombers + 1 salvager was my multiboxed setup, netting about 1.5b/hr.
---
Well, shield extenders bloom your sig making you easier to hit, where as armor doesn't. Also, shield has no passive version of the adaptive invul, so even buffer ships are vulnerable to neuts. Armor reppers also use less cap then shield boosters, and the T2 armor repairers are actually worth running when compared to T2 shield boosters. This means that unless you resort to bling active armor ships will usually have more sustainability then active shield ships. Armor tanks also tend to have slightly higher resists when compared to shield tanks. Finally, shield tanking takes mid-slots, leaving only room for damage or agility mods in the lows, where armor tanking leaves room in the mids for EWAR, which is generally more useful then anything you can fill low slots with.
---
&gt; Most of fighter micro comes from re[-]targeting.
---
And it's awfully boring too. I miss the days of sitting with my ass hanging out of shields having fighter groups to people.
---
It's definitely one of the most discussed QoL changes in my group. We all really love it.
---
Oh man imagine how much nicer that is for someone that lives in a hole with a Null Sec static
---
Oh dear lord shush! 😱
---
Take your time &lt;3
---
You also stated they always have to get enough evidence on every ban which, evidently, they don't always do. Or am i turning that around aswell? Or maybe it's you whos turning words around. I never said they should ban everyone who gets reported without a check, but your claim for them *needing* to do a lot of work on gathering evidence is simply wrong.
---
ASB may not use cap while you have charges, but it used so much cap it's completely unviable once it runs out, whereas an AAR can still provide reps after running out of paste. Passive armor tank can't be neuted off (since you mentioned capacitor warfare), and it leaves much more room for utility in the mids - webs, points, cap boosters, additional props are all items that are all much more easily fitted on armor ships. Don't underestimate the importance of your sig either, signature bloom is a very real thing. And finally, most ships are just better suited for one type of tank or another - you wouldn't fit a solo retribution with a shield tank, for example, since it only has two mids.
---
That's a 7 day rolling list I think. Top all time Thrasher pilots have 17,000+
---
100% wish we had dread abyssal sites for us to run in dreadnaughts.
---
thanks lou :D yeap thrasher can perform really well in null. I have a new video coming up soon which shows that it can solo a retribution. I hope we fight sometime together again lou.

yea i did still does it unfortunately

Init. Fc who was recently unbanned by a major ccp fuck up. You care because you made the effort to write this.
---
Oh I would have absolutely no problem with it. It would make my life so much easier.
---
I'm just aware that this would be extremely powerful.

Have you submitted a support ticket yet?

Eve University is a great group to start with and are all about helping you learn the various aspects of the game.  Their wiki is another great source of information on nearly all areas of the game.

how come you dont fc when you know this?
---
Don't forget the Nyx!
---
They should be priced x3 though.
---
Ok so you can't double click on the wreck, but can you move your ship simply by setting speed to max? Is it possible to just forget the wreck and move on?
---
in b4 CCP bans you for RMT and refuses to discuss the ban with you
---
Dont they accumulate if you dont kill them? Or are those the cap escalation ones? Its been a while..
---
if i move it stops responding but i can click around the menus and do stuff but the moment i move i have to close the game
---
Ill certainly take a look, thanks
---
yea i did that, i just did this cause ive heard alot of people say they dont respond

I heard his parents gave him the trust fund, either way dude is spoiled rotten.

Imagine wanting to be noticed so badly that you try to get attention on reddit of all places.

You could setup the camp in a pipe system with smartbombing battleships on the out-gate.  The smart bombs would then "catch" them as they're landing on the gate.
---
Note - They'll need to warp directly to the out-gate as a gate tactical may cause them to land out of range.

If you're in a corp you absolutely kill the drifter response battleship, or at the very least let your corpmates know there's one on the loose.

Restrict grid sizes. Limit the number of stations allowed in a system based on it's size. Watch New Eden burst into war. Primarily affects hisec, but it can be done

Hands down one of the best video's in a long time. The editing was spot on!
---
No, we're asking for. Less multiboxers/bots= higher value of  ore

I know right.

That defeats the purpose of being affordable to newbros. Ease of skill purhase was one of the main goals  of this QOL feature.

You could set up hotkeys and click on mouse button 4 and 5 to change between windows - previous and next. These procs should be as hard to manage as 13-16 covetors
---
Cytoserocin Gas Clouds will explode randomly upon harvester cycle completion for around 1500 mixed Thermal/EM damage. This is all based on RNG, so it us possible to proc multiple explosions back to back. For this reason a passive regen shield tank is recommended which can reliably tank at least 50 DPS.
---
And yes, Mykoserocin is utter garbage, don't bother with it.
---
Well you better reimburse that tempest!
---
Hah just messing with ya bro! Always glad to help! o7
---
I'm nearing 50m SP on two of my characters, I'm thinking about buying some skill injectors before that happens to maximize their worth:
---
1. If I inject and don't allocate them will they increase my total skillpoints to 50m?
---
2. If I inject and don't allocate them until after I pass 50m I assume the amount of un-allocated skillpoints will remain the same?
---
3. Any other tips?
---

---
greater scaling in how things are priced would be appropriate, both skill books and skills.  for instance an obscure omega skill for research might be 3x priced, while a base armor skills should maybe only be 10% overpriced
---
I'll do you one better. If you can warp in w/Prospect cloaked, you can maneuver to a point where you can huff the gas at least 100km from the sentries. They won't aggress and you're free to huff the whole cloud. Be very careful going around the cloud though, the "0m" radius is much larger than most objects, and it will decloak you if you get within 2km. Best to give the clouds a wide berth then sit on the top (or bottom, for the lower cloud) of them to huff.
---
Can't be *constantly* because then there's no time for updating spreadsheets to track who's turn it is to complain
---
CEO of CCP
---
It's ok. It will be another year before all the freighters have been seeded
---
I think it can be summed up that shield tank fits in mids. And be careful underestimating the sig radius penalty and most shield tanked ships have low base speed as a balancer. Shields are also more cpu intensive, which means it competes more with your dps lows.
---
I won eve years ago, but this brings back so much memories. I loved this place.
---
Well, about 10 times in comms FC told people about that specific gate camp, telling them to not just fly in like an idiot
---
Thank you!
---
I think the fight at the athanor was kinda happening because of those 2 carriers caught 80 off the athanor, which ran away to another structure as soon as the frat fleet landed (the bubbles were on one side of the carriers, the other structure on the other)
---
Wait. Hang on. What happens if I neut a passive shield tank?
---
Because I have 2 toddlers I take care of full time now and I was taking a break/vacation from it after FCON fell apart. Granted I would likely have less to deal with now but I dont want to be in the middle of something important and have to log because my 2 demons are doing something they shouldnt be.
---
show on this doll where did INIT touch your rorqual.
---
Lemme just gate my pve fit carrier around live on stream without an e-cyno, what could go wrong?
---
That pretty much describes my feelings reading that bullshit, well done.
---
If you mean passive recharge (as in shield flux coils etc.), those can't be neuted off, but they are exceedingly rare in PVP, mainly because of the sheer number of mods you have to fit in order to get a decent tank out of it. Buffer and active shield tanks almost always depend on at least invulnerability fields working, and therein lies the weakness to capacitor warfare - there is no equivalent to energized adaptive nano membranes for shields, or even adaptive nano plating - in other words, a passive module that provides resistance to all damage types.
---
People make mistakes dude. I think it would be better for the actual PEOPLE working at CCP and the community if they simply learned from the mistakes and made an *effort* not to repeat them again.
---
It's not a war crime if they deserve it.
---
Look at joining Eve Uni.
---
1. Yes
---
2. Yes
---
3. Injectors are like crack, using them is addictive and leaves you strung out. If you have the spare ISK what you are doing isn't a bad idea, but generally I wouldn't recommend injecting just for the sake of it. Be careful you don't fall into injecting just to supplement your skill que speed instead of injecting because you need something now. The latter is very useful, the former is just a drain on your ISK/wallet.
---
Oh look Evan dying again, colour me surprised.
---
Somewhere out there Piir8 is mad you didn't offer him up as the answer.
---
That's a really fucking sobering post. More power to you dude.
---
nah
---
i am an amateur and I wrote a thing to yell 'enemy spotted' when neut appeared on overview, log event in text file, and screenshot named with timestamp. Took about an hour.
---
way overestimating how hard code is
---
I don't see how Goons would solely benefit from Dread Abyssal sites.  I think it'd be a fun thing in general and a good way to get Dreads involved in PvE.
---
Good fucking riddence
---
i fixed it
---
As a newbro your first priority is to try to find corps. /r/evejobs is a good place to start. There'a plenty of newbro corps to join.
---
In the sidebar there's a Discord server link. Ask for help in #newbie-help.
---
Though if you want more one-on-one guidance, [Dreddit](https://www.dredditisrecruiting.com/) does have a mentors program which you can apply for once you join.
---
We're a Reddit-based corp, so if that's not your thing you can try out other corps like Brave Newbies or Horde.
---
Look forward to seeing you all there!
---
That whole cost thing is why I have been trying out doing the Firestorm and Dark sites myself. I think the firestorm has a lot of potential, you just have to fit more damage than tank and rely a bit more on your buffer (which can be very scary at times). 
---
I think the Dark sites are cool, the main issue I am finding is finding ships that are in the cruiser class, have primarily missile damage focus, and have most if not all of their hard-points for launchers. Some people say you can do them with a specific Gila fit that uses modules to increase drone optimal range, but i'm not sure how well that works, never tried it myself, Caracal seems to work, but having a really hard time thinking of more, possibly T2 Mini. ships have more launcher focus?
---
Several of our corps do that and that's not a bad thing.
---
I’ve never really had an issue, I usually have the people and places window connected to my dscan, and all my safes and stuff are in there. Plus i feel like adding bookmarks to the overview would mean that my 2000 gate tacks would quickly become cumbersome.
---
Fun fact there are two crab nebulas! One in the northern sky and one in the southern sky. The one in the pic is the southern one.

Lost 2 bil 2 weeks ago.. hell of a good fight though :D
---
a carrier a day keeps the doctor away. 
---
This guy has issues.
---
And now because he left, 3 families are gonna go hungry because those diplos no longer have any work.
---
Oh pretty cool, didn't know that.
---
What did it?
---
didn't really find a situation to use it... until I jumped an alt into abyssal flying a worm ... without racial drone spec trained and T2 drones.  
---
That QOL saved me from self-destruct.
---
This guy again...
---
What is it you want to do in eve? Like when you think space mmo with lots of groups and history what do you see as your part in that?
---
This. 
---
They are the most newbro friendly have classes and everything for you to learn from. They will teach you everything you need to know and are active in all space.
---
And a good way to turn Abyssal Deadspace into more Abyssal Krabspace.
---
No thank you.
---
You forgot Dreads are already plenty involved in PVE.  
---
Wormholes.
---
yes it is and i know it, i thought it was clear it's only for 7 days
---
I just wana see you personally give it a shot.  I'm willing to bet you can't, because unlike the other people the shit I said was simple and sane.  CCP doesn't randomly (should put that in past tense now for sure) and if he WERE wrongly banned the best course of action wasn't public thread posting, it was quiet conversation with the company.
---
Tell me which part of what I said was some how wrong, in your own words.  Try using line breaks to split up your thoughts.
---
Come on... Are you trolling?
---
LOL I saw this guy on twitch earlier and wondered if someone was going to pop one of these.
---
he is doing it intentional btw
---
oh, evan. gotta respect the guy - he liked using and losing caps.
---
Wormholer mad people use dreads for PvE
---
Oh the irony
---
Basically how I see it if the attacker doesn’t kill the structure there’s no amount of spin.  They lose period.  Don’t form up for a bash on day one  if the intention isn’t to kill it on day like 6 or whatever
---
so tired of astra/rait bashes.....or antiplex jump bridges.  so little fun, so little excitement.  and yet 90% of ops now.
---
maybe we should reduce small citadel reinforce periods to only ONE reinforce.  
---
and remove reinforce entirely from low power....
---
--------------
---
remember the days people used to drop caps on POS,  get tackled,  and both sides would drop caps for a brawl.  fun times.  also killed off some caps.
---
Wormholes don't allow dreads to be prolific in PvE to the same extent that anomalies allow carriers to be.
---
There's a world of difference between using one dread to kill high-level rats, and multiboxing a dozen to run sites with rats barely smarter than the average nullbear spodbrain.      
---
Nice try though.
---
Go to eve uni and firstly (I MEAN FIRSTLY) train the magic 14 *and shove in some skills to atleast like 3 or 4 for a couple of ships you do want to fly*
---
For me i trained into armor ships first, and turrets and drones. So, at the beggining between the magic 14 i trained turret skills, drones, and gallente/amarr ship skills.
---
Prob fhe first easiest route
---
Also you should train into your "isk niche", ie if you want to do explo start getting up the scanning skills between as well
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0ximxe4XtU
---
Come to lowsec, we are shooting random people flying random shit all the time!
---
Basically because there isn't anything else to do here, the place sucks, but you can get a lot of good fights.
---
Hi multi
---
Also I’m confused what
---
this is news?   one carrier?
---
are the pvp opportunities today really so bad?
---
Asher has great legs
---
Time stamp for full video is 5:04:00
---
The main corps for new players are Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, Eve Uni, and Signal Cartel. 
---
I recommend joining the in game channels for all of them, looking them up on their websites or finding websites talking about them, and seeing which one you think you’d like the most. 
---
Also, don’t be afraid to jump around between a few of these groups, none of them will hold it against you
---
I agree. One of the best changes to Eve that CCP has made since I've been playing.
---
Removing it from low power is the answer. Small groups need a possibility to defend I know big groups spam them but thats the problem not the reinforcement timers.. 
---
The fact that null can spam 100 astras and raits just as an EHP defence.. Is the problem.. The fact every system has a keepstar has a fortiz.. Theres no limit.. I honestly can't believe ccp didn't limit them but they fucking decide to with the jammer and beacon.. Fuck off ccp.. If you dont know what your doing stop and fucking let us.. This is becoming cancerous you will kill eve before you make it better at this rate.
---
'SOV' Nul-sec Bloc PVP isn't the be all and end all. Just saying.
---
I don't understand why this guy's so obsessed with fitting Hels and Nidhoggurs with armor tanks.
---
Careful, he might ban you next!
---
Yes, they did
---
There is probably a technical limitations to that.  
---
Did you notice that overview tab only updates once every second?  
---
It's because tab content is created on the server and sent to you over the network.  
---
Every additional tab means more work for the server, and more stuff to be sent.  
---
Now Imagine you are in 9-4 slugfest with 10 overview tabs open...
---
LOL.. I really probably make 1 bil a week just PVPing and scooping the loot.
---
Speak up and make your presence known. Follow what the fc was doing (if he was calling logi keep at it etc etc). Clear jams first if you can and focus on anchoring the fleet properly.
---
Creep MacCreep
---
I too am a wormholer btw and really enjoy the convenience of it. Particularly for low cost books for an alt.
---
Dirk was more than a little drunk on Saturday night.
---
Because space is already super empty with high pocket/umbrella concentration points.
---
We need incentives to spread out in the space we already have while limiting the ability to protect large areas.
---
This would be a first step towards incentivizing smaller style gameplay.
---
I know what people you talk to and what about, it's not 'much' nor 'diverse' lmao. Those same people all think you're insufferable. The only brainwash bubble that exists is the non-reality one you have created for yourself.
---
agreed.
---
as for small groups. honestly i don't see how dmg caps and reinforce periods do anything to defend them from larger entities.
---
outside of asset assist. and TZ tank. living in NPC space was honestly easier as you had stations they couldnt take you out of.   
---
maybe we should look into some "limited" form of sov control(activity grows) in npc nullsec for these small corps.   (or find some other solution)
---
Fair enough. I feel like the comparison to Abyssal space is a little apples to oranges, since it's generally more work intensive to catch abyssal runners (safe from pvp while in the pocket, gotta have probes to scan the trace, etc) so I would lean towards tilting the anom losses to pvp rather than pve, but otherwise I get what you're saying and I think we're on similar mind tracks.

Going to do some body work on it and do a full respray.
---
The one issue with that is that that's more rewarding to an experienced player than a new player. A new player looks at a week-long training queue for a single module, logs off, and never logs on again.
