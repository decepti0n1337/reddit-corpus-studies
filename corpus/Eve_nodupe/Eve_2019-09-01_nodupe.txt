You heard it here folks, actually collecting the numbers and running statistical analysis of those numbers is officially koolaid because Olmeca can't spin math.
---
---
---
It was fucking embarrassing. Vets on coms were talking about the fight to come as if it were going to be one to talk about for a long time. It was impressive seeing the caps in full array in my little jackdaw but....man. You know you're fighting bads when even your own fc's sound embarrassed about the other guys staying docked up.
---
actually in past years, this is when the PCU would start to recover as people were coming back from summer and getting re-invested in the game and getting the traditional Fall and Winter wars started.
---
Goons aren't exactly doing much to change that with all the ridiculously toxic comments in here lol
---
CCP says up to 20,000 accounts are created a week, those bot numbers are a drop in the bucket.
---
&gt;I don't have to have data for my position
---

---
The Olmeca method: "I don't have to prove I'm right, all I have to do is accuse you of being wrong and then hum loudly so I can't hear the counter argument"
---
Wow, and I though the Gabloons shit was fucked up, this is down right an anti-member way to run a coalition, especially if you aren't operating 100% SRP to compensate
---
the first time some nobody dies trying to JF their shit to jita to sell on the market is going to be a beautiful shit storm to watch.
---
Bring back SPAI buyback.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
^(*I have no bias in this at all*)
---
Is the model old? or just ugly?
---
It's kinda ridiculous how they tend to turn sub-mode on so it just becomes a list of people agreeing with everything the mitanni and boat say 
---
Like today they were arguing with Olmeca in chat, and then in the middle of the discussion they turn the submode on and then continue to talk about it without allowing Olmeca to respond lmao
---
you seem like the kind of person who puts applesauce on a steak.
---
Exactly what I look for when I browse here. Great one. 9.2bn isk kill. Love it.
---
Did you fly too close to the drones? Afair in the briefing they cautioned not to approach the drones.
---
said no one ever.
---
Keep your eyes open for more foxholers shenanigans in the near future
---
We have another AAR getting written
---
I like the bulb-iness of the older Gallente ships. I hope any Helios or Atron remodel keeps that.
---
I prefer Mayo on my steak
---
My only claim is that I trust CCP likes money. I don't need any data to base that claim on.
---
The guys who ran Enron liked money, and they claimed the numbers said whatever they wanted them to till the money ran out.
---
Which ones are the newer gallente ships? Hecate?
---
Thats literally the point though. It's not some forum for open and fair discussion. It's a circlejerk of people that have so little in life they're willing to cling to and pay for two autists tell them how to feel.

Well fuck.
---
I've been here since the beginning.
---
a*
---
Still better rate than some of the LP buyback rates by fw corps out there.
---
That's mean blackout doesn't change
---
Yes I sometimes do, and I leave my car in my garage. Pretty cool huh
---
Yeah but there is no short term cash grab in this scenario.
---
That is the data you and everyone else can access.  
---
The data you and Mittani are looking for (active subscription numbers/alts/etc.) is held by CCP and even if they decided to share it with CSM members, he could not talk about it.
---
Aeon
---
I hate the Ferox look, but it's such a good fleet ship
---
Except no. Our of those 20,000 accounts, only about 800 still log in after 30 days.
---
Among those 20 000 accounts, there is the 90% of new players that doesn't play longer than a few days.
---
Ketchup is where it's at.
---
iron armada was fun to flywith when i was in fountain.
---
Am I the only one with one account
---
Please have PI extractors be able to be restarted by the app. Only restarted would save so much in game time.
---
I like the moros :(
---
Right? I can't tell if it's because the text keeps changing every time I read it, or if the text is somehow draining my intellect every time my eyes pass over it.
---
Had only ever heard of RKK doing this?
---
ROFL, WHAT? Did you forget Hilmar's sale bonus check is dependent on the next month or so of game activity and performance? It doesn't get much more short term in the business world the guy has 30 days out of the 1 year window left to hit whatever goals were agreed to in the PA purchase to secure his performance based sale bonus. Its why he's taking the "throw everything in the kitchen at the wall and see what bumps numbers" approach to game design at the moment, its why he went from full on AFK for most of a decade to suddenly deciding around 3 months before the deadline that something had to change right this very minute and to hell with the consequences.
---
Me too, but it could look so much more badass
---
They said that they are ready to take a hit in the short term for a healthy game in the long term. It's barely been a month that those changes started...
---
Well...imho both lol
---
And the other 10% are returning bots that will be here for at least 6 months before being banned again.
---
and how many of those 800 are bots coming right back to the game and using the previous botted and laundered money to inject right back into their preferred botting ships?
---
Same! Except for the ISK flow part :)
---
In the end of the day, it's their stream and they can do whatever they want. They do not need to provide a platform for Olmeca, wrong or right.
---
Blackout or cyno changes aren't injecting cash to CCP or filling the game with short term accounts and profits. Making it about Hilmars bonus is the ultimate koolaid you can ever hear in INN. Stop parroting everything they say and start using your own critical thinking faculties.
---
But you still post here non-stop.
---
Wow. This thread.
---
Blackout rules null sec is alive can’t wait for cyno changes
---
I haven't heard them say it once yet, I'll wait for you to point out the twitch clip showing where they did. This is simply me looking at what they posted about the sale, reading a calendar and putting Hilmar's actions in perspective. 
---
"start using your own critical thinking faculties. " For a guy who sounds like a grr goons broken record 100% of the times it's hysterical to see you say that. You can see past your own bias and its as funny to me as the INN bias is.
---
Interesting, well done there
---
Eve is far from dead, and there's plenty to do. It's definitely worth playing, especially now because of the blackout. You should try joining a community in null security space and really experience the other, more exciting part of eve. Dreddit is currently recruiting and has alot to offer a returning player.
---
What's wrong with Aeon? It looks like a proper carrier, an the textures seem pretty modern
---
0, according to CCP.
---
0 of the accounts are bots.
---
Yeah, I'm aware. I didn't even suggest they do.
---
Chimera
---
This is a thread about visuals, not ship  performance. What would you change about the Ferox?
---
Wormhole space has never been more fun. Moved my guys into a c2-null and it’s the most fun I’ve had in 9 years of eve
---
Welp, my freight services just started. Jita and back
---
I strongly disagree with your opinion, I think the new chimera is the best-looking ship in the game. Not that the old one was bad, but this one is glorious. Maybe Just replace the Leviathan model with an upscaled old chimera model
---
Navitas was remodelled quite recently.
---
navitas remodel, vexor remodels, dominix remodel
---
So it worked when given direct assistance from the developers of the game, including licenses to print isk and Inside game mechanic knowledge.
---
New one isn’t bad, but it lacks the imposing presence the old one had. 
---
Watch day of darkness 2, and imagine new model. It doesn’t have the same effect.
---
Btw fun fact. Empyrean age, refers to a chimera super carrier.
---
Or just move into Thera in live solo
---
There's a whole lot of people without horde alts these days such as goons ;)
---
PCU has been lower then it's ever been for the last 4 years, this isn't a new thing.
---
Horde bad for not adapting and building an empire like goons.
---
Horde bad for not offering the same deals as some of the other entities.
---
in eve, the fighters of a carrier are controlled by the pilot of the carrier.  
---
the closest thing to helping a carrier would be piloting a subcapital ship alongside. this actually has been a very relevant discussion of game balance for the last few years where capitals can fulfill their roles without needing a support wing of actual pilots. some people are pushing for changes to give subcapitals a more significant role, but as it stands, it's more desirable to have 10 carriers on grid than having 1 carrier and a support wing of 9 pilots. add to that the fact that the barrier to entry for capitals is significantly lower than before, and you've got yourself a situation where it's basically a race to having the highest number of capitals on grid.
---
to sum it up, the answer to your question is negative for the moment, but given the recent attitude of ccp towards these issues, it might be worth checking again later. maybe even start a free account to train up some skills in the meanwhile- but it's no big deal if you don't want to bother either.
---
" 0, according to CCP. "  
---
Go ahead and link the dev blog, and then explain how corps have people get banned, and then 2 weeks later someone else with the same number of accounts is right back in that corp in the same space running the same bots?
---
I absolutely think this game is what you make of it - if you think you're going to enjoy coming back, pick her up and get going my dude.
---
Onlined. They didn't get contested at all either, so now they have super projection over half of detorid and can push wicked creek/scalding harder.
---
Yeah. I think that's the biggest issue we face right now - free intel. Both from in game and third party tools.

When Legacy formed and we were all in the same comms

Not sure he even actually pilots ships as Mittens ever. Which is a shame, I'd love to collect that corpse.
---
Well geez. Glad I left beans when I did. I don't think I could survive another night of 20-25 people in comms, but only 3-4 active in eve while everyone else is playing anything other than eve. Having to perma mute officers in comms who can't stop screeching memey reactions with their mic shoved so far down their throats it could tickle their assholes.
---
It wouldn't have been so bad if pings didn't consist of:
---
* Flying an all dps bs/bc fleet, split between hs/ls, in and out of thera towards another wh chain to defend a guy who ends up having 1 unfit fax to help defend his own home with. 90 jumps in a bhaal later we are back home.
---
* Flying 25+ jumps into the corps alpha alt farm hole (yes) just to dock up for 2+ hours, then go home.
---
* Inviting 2-3 other alliances to join us, corp officers fucking around and being cancer in comms, causing 30 people to drop fleet at once and bail. THe op turned out shitty anyways.
---
* Waiting until 3-4 am to ping for rage roll fleets after everyone is done playing minecraft and going to bed.
---
* Playing minecraft instead.
---
But it was that bad.  Literally someone had to say "UWU" every 30 seconds or the autists would start spasming.
---
RKK didn't have a communist structure iirc. Evolution did though and for the most part still does from the last time i played. Times change though, so a communist structure doesn't pay off as well as it did when the game first started.

---
The working theory is that among the concept art produced for the ship was one piece that was a cross-section. For some reason, that image was the only one sent to the modeler. Despite the incredulity of it, the modeler would rather be paid than voice concern, so that's the ship model they ended up with.
---
True story, the art team forgot they were still working on the model and submitted it 3/4ths done
---
Nova left a few years ago but he always lived for the triage game play. Waiting for the day to see him dying in a faction FAX because I know he would have a good story about it.
---
The symmetrical redesigns that showed up in a recent presentation (fanfest maybe?) looked alright.
---
This is essentially tax on mining, same as npc bounty tax. Just 30% is a little steep.
---
Silly newb question here, how do you “easily” control an alt at the same time as your primary instance ?  I’m in enough of a panic as it is if someone surprises me while ratting outside of hisec, I can’t image issues commands to two chars. 
---
Can you run both on the same eve client somehow ? Or is it running the client twice? Or is it using two computers (or virtual machines)?

Incursus,

---
Vexor,

Have YOU quit then?

Just move to wormholes man. I came back from a year break that I took after a 3 year break and I can promise wormholes are way more fun than null ever was. I spent my entire eve career in null and really nothing else compares to wormholes

You can change skills now via the app!?
---
Yes, this.
---
Early Gallente ships had this kind of curving, techno-organic feel later hulls and redesigns kind of lost. I really miss it.
---
Actually, all the 4 factions have kind of been moving towards a "middle average" aesthetic.
---
Are they really doing anything about that though? Someone making nullbear isk can easily afford a cyno alt right? It’s business as usual... what else did they change?
---

all other reasonable responses aside, it was his second time flying a dread period from the op, so sheer lack of experience is also an explanation
---
TIL I pay less rent than bloc F1ers.
---
And the main promise made by most blocs in exchange for being one of those is free krabbing space...
---
The numbers don't lie. Chaos has resulted in fewer players logging in. That is a proven fact.
---
are you memeing or is this real? Because I don't see the unfinished part
---
Eh, they do it for the last 15 minutes of every show to try to get more people to subscribe. Now, they absolutely do ban people from chat if they're being too obnoxious or off-message or whatever, so it's not like they're without sin in this regard. The sub-only mode, though, isn't for that reason -- it's for money.
---
The short-term cash grab is Hilmar's acquisition bonus for meeting KPIs come October.
---
A good third of the Minmatar fleet could use a spruce-up. Cyclone (which also needs a buff) and Bellicose are probably the bigger offenders.
---
Let there be no doubt that Pandemic Horde exists solely as a money making enterprise for a very small number of people.
---
I don’t get it. Are u arguing that we shouldn’t calculate the mass on a wh so that we get the most bang for our bucks before jumping into Novac?

We can’t undock more, bc we literally fit as much as possible.... u dumb wingspan man.

Ps: excel &gt; clipboard

Tell me how blackout and cyno changes help hilmar to meet his targets. You can't argue the game is dying and losing players and say this helps hilmar to meet his targets simultanesouly.

Meme of rabbit with secret Barghest  counter needs updating

More than likely will be a horde leadership alt.

Hard to starbkard

So the reason I go for the stuff that’s closer is because I can make use of my grapple and point. If I go after a battleship that’s 35 km away, it doesn’t matter how much damage I do, that damage is wasted if the target can just warp off anyway.
---
Thank you. I really appreciate the explanation as I just came back and I am pretty ignorant of current people. I only know famous people like Mittens, Shadoo, and progod from Scrapheap.

---
Explained it and just going to add the Triv invasions looks like shit content imo they are forcing on to people. Because most people didn't want to do them and because the lack of participation CCP I guess is forcing it on ppl.
---
That long?
---
Yeah. From what I gathered, it was a couple peoples first time flying a capital in combat, myself included. So you’re likely to see a bunch of shit fits if you look deep enough.
---
Welcome to fighting at the highest tier. 
---
You think these guys that brawl in super blingy ships are stupid shouldnt be thinking it through? Is that what you're trying to say? 
---
Do you think these kind of fights just happen? Come on man.
---
The carriers are all pretty reasonably fit except for one shield Thanatos. No idea why there were so many pro fit dreads.
---
True opinion? Go find another game. Go look at eve-offline.net and actually see the eve is dying meme come to life. CCP has actively been trying to squeeze the last few pennies outnof the player base thats still around to look good to peral abyss (ccp and eve were sold to a korean gaming company and hilmar was promised large bonuses for hitting certain sales and login numbers). On top of that ccp has been implementing shitty changes this summer that are ensuring the final death of eve as everyone has known it for the last 16 years.
---
I would not be shocked if a large portion of the loss is bots
---
Can someone explain why barghests and why those fits?
---
&gt;Go ahead and link the dev blog
---
Oh god, you autistic fuckstick. You really need to learn how to put pieces of information together. If you really need everything spelled out for you, you're gonna have a rough life.
---
It was mentioned at FanFest (2018), it was mentioned on TiS (2019) and it was mentioned on the EVE Invasion Tour on Twitch (2019). Every week roughly 10,000 people log into the game *for the first time*. They're not bots coming back from a ban, *because bots have logged in before*.
---
Of the 10,000 people, 96% aren't logging in after 30 days anymore. So of 10,000 people, about 400 are left after 30 days. And the number likely gets smaller by the 6 month and 1 year mark.
---
So no, 22,000 bans is not "a drop in the bucket". 400 players per week last 30 days. 22,000 / 400 = 55 weeks worth of new accounts to recoup that number, and that's assuming **all** the players who are still here after 30 days are bots. If 50% of them are, that's 110 weeks worth of new accounts to recoup 22,000 bans.
---
Considering that bots probably have more in-game time per day than people, this obviously has a noticeable effect on PCU. PCU has been trending down, and the loss of 22,000 accounts to bans was a considerable portion of that.
---
You're arguing that botters just make a new account when they're banned. If that's the case you'd expect to see new account numbers spike after a purge and for the PCU to reflect the recovery - but this doesn't happen. There's random spikes in new account creations, but it doesn't correlate with an increase in PCU. And if it did happen, dollars to testicles CCP would notice and check up on it.
---
&gt;explain how corps have people get banned, and then 2 weeks later someone else with the same number of accounts is right back in that corp in the same space running the same bots?
---
No, I think it's *your* turn to present some sources/evidence now.
---
That was an amazing fight, I can't believe I just moonwalked out of there😂
---
Bring back the old Moa
---
Indeed good sir. Have a gold!
---
Hey cool, my Phoenix didn't make it on your shitfit list :)
---
wormholes
---
find a good low class group, they actually get fun content
---
At least yours was active fit with active rigs, still bad for a dread fight but there are situations where it would be good.
---
Ah, the classic “huge taxes and still terrible SRP.”
---
Oh you sweet summerchild....
---
This is my solo HAW fit that does good most of the time. Basically I was sitting in comms bored out of my freaking mind and a friend was like "hey are you going on the cap roam". My ears perked up and I was like "a fuggin wat?!". He said "yeah they just left, bring whatever random fit dread or carrier you have". So I just grabbed the only thing I happen to have at that station and rolled with it. It turned out being pretty good and doing a good bit of work on their sub-cap gang.
---
I'm not hating wyvern :p I just want that wyvern would be more useful so my Alliance wouldn't be so pissed for me wanting one :p
---
I would be.  If 6,000 players are bots then eves already dead
---
Miss you N0va, and your balls to the walls "fuck it let's goooooo" mentality, even if it was ~~sometimes~~  often suicidal... it was usually epic :P

Kestrel, I'm fine with the current model but I'd like to see what the remodel would look like.

Yup just safe log a few bros in system.

A few hours later log in SB, cloak up immediately. Scout for a warpin... everyone else logs in and warps to SB, get kills, log off afterwards GG no re.
---
Bruh, I joined around the time Goons were dicking Bob. I am going to just throw my 2 cents on why Eve is in a permanent decline. Unlike others here, I don't drink the circle jerk kool aid from what I read on this sub reddit, on what is causing the ills of the game.
---
1. CCP said they made 1 Billion € Profit with eve. Since Crucible they didn't put money into eve again. They put 600 Devs sometimes in the past on different Projects all that Projects failed. EVE their Cash Cow is still not on their AGENDA. WE just have Falcon left from a whole community team which we once had. We have under 10 Dev's working on EVE. We don't have devblogs for Rework of Subcaps (t1 Destroyer - BS) we dont have devblog about Tactical Ships. We dont have Devblog about any changes/rework new content and mechanics for Lowsec, Hi Sec, Nullsec or Wormhole space. Factionwarfare is still shit and no update. WE don't have any work of devtime for anything. No big rebalances, rework, no inventions! And don't let me start on the UI and new player experience. - author Elkantar1981 
---
2. The communities elitism, which I too am apart of the blame. This community since I joined in 09 Shat on players who were quitting out of frustration. The terms "can I haz your stuff", "bye", "another carebear gone", and etc was constantly thrown around on the main forums. CCP encouraged the "hardcore nature" of Eve and the community + CCP prided on the pic of the cliff of difficulty.
---
Well doing that over the years has an effect, the only people you have left now are mainly hardcore players. You have no new blood coming in and this communities obsession of pvp fuck care bears is how they say in America "the chickens have come home to roost". 
---
Everyone here blames CCP (which is the bulk their fault), but it if I had to gauge blame % I would say 70/30 (30 being the community). Everyone here is blaming these changes or something else and the reality is the core level the community on top of CCP incompetence. 
---
To be honest I think people on this sub reddit can't accept that Eve is going to be in permanent decline and will shut down in a couple years. Because I can guarantee you, that these changes reversed will not be a flip of the switch and the game will get better. This shit was 10 years too late and this is a desperate attempt imo to restart the game just short of a full wipe.
---
3. Last thing is people being risk adverse with this blue doughnut.
---
TLDR version just read the after the numbers
---
There are only three HQ groups left. The amount of competition you portray isn't even possible when theres 4 fleets up because of TDF running an alt fleet.
---
" Oh god, you autistic fuckstick "
---
awwwww, did I push somebodies button?
---
 "considering that bots probably have more in-game time per day than  people, this obviously has a noticeable effect on PCU. PCU has been  trending down, and the loss of 22,000 accounts to bans was a  considerable portion of that. "
---
They announced banning 22,000 accounts in the last 6 months. We are not down 22,000 people in the player count in that time frame, which is what we would see if they were on so much more than normal players. The decline has been ongoing for close to 6 years, the ban wave is since Janurary. Your math is based on faulty assumptions, you want to see a certain outcome so you make assumptions designed to lead you there.
---
&gt;defenseless targets
---
Yeah man, that Orca with a cyno that can magically spawn 10 supers instantly is totes defenseless.
---
Runs perfectly on the Samsung Galaxy S9+ if that info is of any help.
---
Is that why they're making changes that are supposedly driving the PCU and sub counts down...?
---
But that currency is the SRP, which you redeem for in-game isk, covering the loss of the ship?
---
Name checks out
---
Load up a few frigates and destroyers and head to a FW hotspot to find some random fights and maybe meet some people.

Mittens only pilots during elite scenarios. Super fleets and alliance tournaments

---
&gt;They announced banning 22,000 accounts in the last 6 months. We are not down 22,000 people in the player count in that time frame
---
Why do you think 22,000 banned bot/RMT accounts would result in a linear drop of 22,000 PCU?
---
&gt;which is what we would see if they were on so much more than normal players.
---
No it's not. We'd only see a decline. There is absolutely nothing I said that necessitates a linear decline in PCU. I said that bots have more play time than people. The average person plays a few hours/week.
---
&gt;The decline has been ongoing for close to 6 years
---
Oh, so it's not because of blackout? THANKS FOR AGREEING WITH ME. XD XD XD XD
---
&gt;Only the ones not perma banned, the fresh ones count as new log ins, how can you be so supremely arrogant while responding on this topic and then say something that stupid?
---
Okay then little guy, tell me, how many of the new accounts are bots, and where is your source? :)

Probably very few. Those graphs are a few years old, but the numbers represented where the main character of an account was. While some people have dedicated accounts for alts or industry alts, most people put them on extra slots. Even with people having extra accounts for cynos/dreads/titans/etc, hisec numbers still dwarf nullsec.
---
Fozzie sov is good.
---
Eh, winning is winning. The enemy not showing up is evidence they were outclassed.
---
Just an update like the Eagle got.  That went from the ugliest ship in the game to one of the best-looking IMO.
---
My inner Marx approves.

That would be an insane amount of work to track that..

---
yeah, we were doing the flat earth retardation for a while. Then after i think it was 2 months, that fort thing happened. Feign left shortly after that because our space was promised to an imperium group without our input (ty iron, really neat) so we left
---
I don't think the goontard thought that far ahead.
---
I hope IA find themselves. o/

We have some information regarding alts. This is a few years old, but according to [CCP Quant](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/eveonline/original/3X/9/a/9a48aaa121838d21703c9c91860e379dc5002322.png):
---
* 65% of players have 1 account.
---
* 20.6% of players have 2 accounts.
---
* The rest (14.4% of players) have 2 or more accounts.

A guy in my corp once said 'The Moros is like a fat girl that gives great head. She's beautiful in her own way.'

It can sometimes be tough to notice. Its much easier to see from the front [like this](https://i.imgur.com/0PzAjcn.gif)

I only have one account too!

---
BR: Recon Nyx got tackled by a goons Stuka fleet. Goons thought they was init/snuff and dropped dreads, gave it the old college try.
---
Pamfam calls DDs green, the rest is history.
---
TBH, EVE would be in a much better place right now if Goons hadn't picked it up. And it would be in a much better place even if Goons stayed, but Mittens had quit the game before he became anyone of any relevance.
---
Can you still install from that?
---
When you resort to crude metaphors to describe diplomacy, your credibility goes out the window. TEST was being ganged up on by the rest of the galaxy and was pushed South near Goonspace. Then the choice was between being ganged up on by the rest of the galaxy plus an eight hundred pound gorilla, or making friends with the gorilla.
---
I was there
---
OMG, ATARI WAS DIRECTING EVE DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS TO MAKE CASH BACK THEN?!
---
yeah i can't even install it :( says somthing about not compatibile with your device or somthing like that Even though phone has android 7.

I think they were just the contracted publisher of the physical media.

Oh nice. As dead as eve has been lately, today has certainly felt alive.

And hull tank so you can fit a bunch of tackle.
---
Well said. Actions speak louder than words and all the actions of the past several years show that EVE is no longer CCP's primary focus. It is disheartening to see the skeleton crew that remains. Supporting EVE means subsidizing the development of all the other (so far unsuccessful) games CCP spend their time building, which are aimed at totally different audiences, while watching the game we are interested in languish.
---
Please god this poor ship :(
---
So after a year of hearing about the unjustly elected "GSM", the CSM elections are fair after all.
---
Their metrics are based on Monthly Average Users. They can juice that number severely by putting in changes that bittervets have been clamoring for over many years, and bait them into resubbing, even if just for one sub cycle. The target date is some time in October for the acquisition bonus to pay out based on this (and maybe other?) contingencies. They don't have to worry about the deleterious long term effects of their changes if they win the immediate short term.
---
Our dudes are arguing that this is bad for the long term. CCP's upper management is packing their golden parachutes using the MMORPG management equivalent of fire-fallow agriculture over the short term.
---
They don't care about the long-term effects of their changes. They just want to bait you and yours into resubbing once so they can meet their MAU KPI and jump out of the crashing plane that is Eve Online: A Space-Themed Spreadsheet.
---
You may wish to understand the topic at hand, even vaguely, before posting like that.
---
They can manipulate any number they want or hide it from you.
---
In this case they have no reason to. If you are right and game is bleeding subs as of right now, they literally have no reason to manipulate data so that they can save blackout. There is no immediate short term win, neither middle term or long term win.
---
Thorax. Imicus. Gallente ships in general look weird and dumb for the most part.
---
Where is the best place to store items/ships ?
---
All accounts are omega. I run x3 screens and each client in window mode.
---
Yeah, the kind that doesn't drop intact armor plates.
---
Of course it's your first.  A cat sitting on a keyboard can get cap kills in null now.  Good AAR though.
---
Uh.. not really.
---
woosh
---
70% ? wtf ?
---
Ugh god fuck no. The only thing uglier than the old Moa is the Celestis.
---
What about the Aeon?
---
For Abyssal Proving Grounds? It's 1v1 Cruiser PvP, so a ton of money can result in really consistent wins. Expensive typically means over 3b for Abyssal, though winning fits for a lot less are still feasible.
---
nice
---
&gt;wormholer btw
---
&gt;only one account
---
No one said I needed fixing. They said your post makes no sense.
---
That's more because of the Gallente  aesthetic than their models though. Thorax for example looks great if you ignore the protruding engine on the bottom
---
&gt;PS: god it's a hard work to maintain composite and walk with Goons through their horrible reasoning but the audience likes it and someone should do it lol.
---
After living with goons for over a decade, the playerbase should understand by now that 90% of what goons say/post/argue/spin is for things in their advantage and against things to their disadvantage. Once you understand the bias and slant, you begin to notice glaring contradictions like the one you just pointed out.
---
Remember, CCP literally had to intervene in the market to save EVE's economy from goontarding.
---
We literally were batphoning goons since the beginning, every single major timer from february until now goons have been on grid with a 200-1000 man fleet to support legacy. But pls keep pushing "it's only cuz panfam (who we outnumber combined with frat) are coming to get us too!"

are you complaining about LZHX reshiping twice with each character and feeding basically 2x shield fleets?

I'm gonna be honest... I'm kind of retarded.

TIL about a new ship

Nice argument you (don't) have there.

&gt;Oh, so it's not because of blackout? THANKS FOR AGREEING WITH ME. XD XD XD XD
---
its been going on for years, in the sense they've been losing a few thousand a YEAR, they just lost 4+ thousand in 2 MONTHS.... no one is agreeing with you besides the voices in your head.
---
" Okay then little guy, tell me, how many of the new accounts are bots, and where is your source? :) "  
---
Oh, so now I need sources even though you have none either?
---
My reaction after I read that. [:ricflair:](https://https://gph.is/1Nkn5mN)

Should've been yours too. :)

Hey man, outfoxed was 3rd party on that one...

We got dropped on by that nyx and a rag
---
Why not just give you the fucking isk?

it's in flux

The client on that disc is Apocrypha, so he can install that and listen to the title screen music.

who gives a Flux abt the Aeon?  :-)
---
every dead body has a few twitches on its way to the morgue.

never been in horde but i see no announcements confirming this

I think waffles are in C2-null static now. I've heard great things too!
---
Theta?
---
can't believe you responded to this nerd's jab at init's pride as if his jab carried weight, but you are a good poster, so you had to reply to someone I guess.
---
Init has earned it's right to ignore trolls like this.
---
not a bot, just a disgusting weeb
---
Sees CO2 tag, not sure if flairbaiting.
---
&gt;they are just in HS and more are needed
---
At least they are in plain sight and not hidden in empty nullsec. And ccp gets more subs if they create more accounts. And they will be in problems when highsec income is nerfed. And I'm smelling a big nerf coming soon.
---
&gt;Its a theoretical concept that hasnt been true in reality for Eve.
---
It's always been the reality. Imagine if ships and modules didn't explode. Have we been playing the same game? :D
---
&gt;you dont control when to get tackled anymore, its chance based
---
Be aligned? Warp off when tackle lands? Have scouts on gates so you see who is coming? Accept few losses now and then if you still make ok isk/hour?
---
&gt;Its the 12 multiboxing Rorqs that just roll a new recon alt
---
I'm sure ccp will nerf rorqs also. If they actually do that chaos stuff they have promised.
---
no idea on the inner-workings of horde but some provable sources or facts would be nice.
---
Yes.
---
I still have that too, and the items that came with it.
---
Oh, you mean TEST?
---
How would we account for the number or bot accounts that have stopped logging in since blackout?
---
I did but i don't agree as you couldn't store supers in stations and most systems didn't have stations so lots of people lived at POS and never cryed about lack of asset safety.
---
A simple fuck off will suffice
---
This game has been alive and well, what're you on about, chief?
---
Imicus hulls, Celestis hulls, Aeon.
---
I see NOVAC is working on transitioning into null sec to fully embrace blobbing and out shipping targets!
---
China's Firewall... the original blackout
---
Well, that is just a reason to not join a shitty alliance.  Join a good one that does not charge monthly rent.  Taxes, sure, but not "rent"

&gt;its been going on for years, in the sense they've been losing a few thousand a YEAR, they just lost 4+ thousand in 2 MONTHS.... no one is agreeing with you besides the voices in your head.

Like I already told you, **[it's August](https://i.imgur.com/2mK7k1t.png)**, you unbelievable tin foil retard.
---
&gt;Oh, so now I need sources even though you have none either?

You can't be **this** fucking retarded... can you?
---
"*It was mentioned at FanFest (2018), it was mentioned on TiS (2019) and it was mentioned on the EVE Invasion Tour on Twitch (2019).*"
---
If you're going to sit there and posit a claim (about bots), post some sources. I already indulged your shifted burden of proof for the sake of charity. That was your one freebie.
---
The point is you can’t publicly advertise your buyback anywhere. So good luck getting any significant number of people to use it. Sure, a few people will get around it somehow, but the majority will either stop mining or deal with the taxes.
---
God cod 1/2's stalingrad intro was gorgeous
---
There is a price to pay for SRP so that developing FCs can actually take out ships en masse and take fights that could be full wipes. It's a decent mechanic that line members don't feel.
---
That's not correct, actually.
---
Scooty Puff Did Nothing Wrong!
---
Thanks I'll make an alt for that.
---
no, but I stopped subbing most of my accounts and waiting to see what is gonna happen in october.
---
the fax u lost movin out was worth a loggerhead...if that counts.
---
Makes it easier on leadership. Or to be specific, makes it easier on Kalibur, since he is literally the only person who handles that stuff, or at least he was when I left Horde earlier this year. 
---
I do have some complaints about the amount of srp, but the gobloons just streamline everything and make it easier for kalibur to keep up. If people choose to cash out after every other loss instead of after each one it cuts his work in half, and a lot of people wait longer than that.
---
Feeding sabres is bad. Stop doing this.
---
It's pretty good. NullSec tumors are being bled. Expect some power vacuums coming up, and hopefully if there's real changed to capitals/cynos/structures, expect lots of wars.

It seems NOVAC is finally learning from the best blobbers in WH History

But yes it's always been said that PI would be great on mobile, but that means CCP will never do it.
---
Which made me more curious why brunch of Icelanders chose to name their video game company CCP two decades ago
---
Barghest have the most missile Volley damage of any subcap (9 effective launchers), paired with Golem (or Hyena) paints and Loki webs they also apply well, as for fits, do you mean the Barghest fits or the cap fits?
---
what the point if those people don't even contribute to his life, afk mining/farming is boring AF and don't create any content 'cause they dock immediatly 
---
i would prefer if CCP keep the blackout and make Eve MUCH more dangerous BUT the reward worth that risk we need more explosion make PvP worth it and asset just a consumable you will loose sooner or latter, make farming less time consuming (high reward but limited like WH) soo people can enjoy PvP
---
and i agree, CCP should adress this issue faster but just "remove blackout" is insufficient, waiting X month the isk sink is dumb and we can't enjoy a better gamedesign
---
You aren’t wrong! They’ve been killing it in that c2-null
---
It's named CCP because the original name wasn't documented
---
Except China is only doing well by taking advantage of capitalism...
---
I think he's pointing out that the corps screaming that Novac wouldn't have been able to take that fleet through a whole have done the same thing themselves, reshipping isn't any different.
---
This.... Is about the tax that I pay IRL. :(
---
Now if they just lower their market tax to a point where people actually seed stuff...

I think there are quite a few smaller corps that still thrive under space communism, it was popular in some of the WH corps I participated in ~ 3-5 years ago.

So what you are saying is you have no presentable proof... cool that's all I needed to know.

" Or to be specific, makes it easier on Kalibur, since he is literally the only person who handles that stuff "

Sounds like  a leadership failure when it comes to setting up alliance structure if there is literally a single person handling that.

Don't bother with industry unless you're doing it for fun. Margins are so tight it's better to buy and sell products like 98.37% of the time
---
No, salvaging doesn't need a fix. Salvaging is almost perfect. However, I like the idea of salvage probes.
---
Salvage is valuable exactly because of its limited field of application and its relative scarcity (despite salvage being virtually obiquitous). Unlike modules which can be recycled or retrieved once a ship pops, salvage is gone once it's submitted to industry.
---
Hi Dragon,
---
Regarding solo "hunting", you listed T3 Cruisers, bombers, and kiting ships. I think you are correct, but this was the meta before the Blackout change was implemented. Why do you find this "chaos era" attempt to be boring and what did you mean by "all fronts" ?
---
This was a surprisingly informative and friendly response.  And correct.

It might not seem like much to old wormholers or whalers , a shit fit nidhoggur . But many of these boys were previously nullbears in faceless Corps where they never got content like this or feelings of accomplishment. I for one, am super proud of the boys for going for it and even more proud they got results.  I’ve never been happier to lead such a band of misfits.

Yeah lmao. Though I don’t think brave is actually there anymore. I think they’re staged somewhere else
---
probably better than horde pets
---
When someone bots to RMT its a money earner. When they get banned they create one or two extra accounts like the hydra. Banning them isnt going to contribute to the falling numbers, if anything its probably keeping the true damage disguised
---
I mean, it has players but it feels empty. No local removes the feeling of people being online with you. Regardless of the games health, it makes it feel sooo much worse because there’s no feedback. Like, is there someone here I missed? Or is the system empty?
---
I’m not really dogging blackout specifically because I like the idea, it just feels really bad
---
Here's to hoping null stats dark permanently!

jokes on you for caring about the OP's opinion at all.

What? Imicus' thrust vector is not aligned  with the center at all, while the only "off center" part of the caracal is the extremely thin beak which probably has insignificant mass

Checkboxes anyone?
---
Okay cool so let's recap:
---
* I posit that 22,000 banned accounts contributed to a declining PCU.
---
* You disagreed on the basis of "22,000 accounts are a drop in the bucket against how many new accounts are made each week".
---
* I point out that 10,000 new accounts are made each week.
---
* Of which, only about 400 are still playing 30 days later.
---
* [You claimed that all 400 are bots.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cy0ihe/mittens_challenges_olmeca_gold_to_a_data_war/eype613/)
---
* I pointed out that in that case, it would take 55 weeks worth of new accounts to produce 22,000 bots.
---
* 110 weeks (over 2 years) if 50% of them are bots.
---
* You asked for sources re: new accounts, I provided them.
---
* You now deny that I provided any sources despite the fact that I did and it's right there on the screen for everyone to see. Stunning play friend, stunning play.
---
You = flaming retard and you've run out of diarrhea to spew and are now so desperate that you are resorting to lying out of reflex, so I guess we're done here.

You shut your whore mouth. Thorax is bae. Even the Imicus isn’t horrible, just different and original.
---
i thought panfam was finally learning how to operate as a modern sov holding coalition, guess i was wrong.
---
Your welcome, karmafleet is recruiting.
---
You make it seem like we've never blobbed a corp before
---
What part of "golden parachute" am I failing to explain? The people responsible for these changes aren't interested in whether the game profits or not, at all, after October. They're taking their payout from Pearl Abyss and leaving entirely. Hell, Hilmar already pre-spent his bonus payout on some VR chat nonsense.
---
Turns out capitalism and authoritarianism work pretty well together.
---
Feel free to make an argument other than "bee man bad" and I'll gladly respond in kind.
---
You = guy who talks about 10k accounts per week. continues to ignore that perma banned bots would be in that number, also ignores that CCP released a stat saying their max monthly new accounts is 20k. HALF your number of 10k per week.... somehow I'm the idiot for not agreeing with your numbers. You proceed to say I never presented any numbers even though my numbers come from teh same source as yours, CCP...

Fair enough. I tend not to be too bothered by it, since I mostly fleet up with the corp for mining/other ISK operations. But I think I get it. I think it just means that people have to form more localised communities, possibly via. chat at the constellational level.

There's no contradiction, though. CCP is baiting people to resub by going down a checklist of popular, empty-calorie game ideas, so they can meet a KPI and get a bonus payout from Pearl Abyss.
---
I can't even see an announcement
---
all I see was that aegaeonos did an impromptu q+a then a bunch of people started complaining about reprocessing
---
also

---
I can bet that the retention numbers are now worse than ever, it was NS that kept them up. We cant even do that now due to the blackout. All these changes could have been made in a more moderate way but first after fixing other things, especially HS and the newplayer experience. Then atleast the bleeding would be stemmed somehow.
---
Just matching your level of discourse.
---
Just the way ccp is pushing to me it seems they want to go with cloaking online. The meta suggest to be clokie ships with a large bomber back bone for dps. I personally just dislike how the meta shifting and find it boring with bomber game play going to be the most entertainment.
---
You can automate all of it.
---
Yeah man they're baiting people to resub by making changes that make people not log in. Brilliant!

The KPI is monthly active users, genius. A user is considered active if he logs in once in that month. If they don't log in again that month, who cares? If they quit and don't log in again after October, who cares? The bonus is paid out and the golden parachutes deploy.
---
Players are making the call on the blackout. Go check CCP Rise interview where he openly says that the decision to keep it in is based on player feedback. Just that, none of the other bullshit being used as arguments.
---
Think minute 16 in the talking in stations, heres your source.
---
&gt;Let there be no doubt that [INSERT NULL ALLIANCE HERE] exists solely as a money making enterprise for a very small number of people. 
---
ftfy
---
&gt;also ignores that CCP released a stat saying their max monthly new accounts is 20k
---
[You said it was 20k week](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cy0ihe/mittens_challenges_olmeca_gold_to_a_data_war/eypcf52/)... which one is it, idiot...
---
Trying to twist and spin now huh...
---
&gt;it would take 55 weeks worth of new accounts to produce 22,000 bots. " (LOL nice counting job). HALF your number of 10k per week.... somehow
---
&gt;somehow I'm the idiot
---
Yes you are, idiot... Go on back up and reread, slowly...
---
I said 55 weeks *worth* of new accounts... only 400 accounts last 30 days...
---
"*400 players per week last 30 days. 22,000 / 400 = 55 weeks worth of new accounts to recoup that number, and that's assuming all the players who are still here after 30 days are bots. If 50% of them are, that's 110 weeks worth of new accounts to recoup 22,000 bans.*"
---
I was only counting the 400 players who last 30 days... idiot...
---
&gt;You proceed to say I never presented any numbers even though my numbers come from the same source as yours, CCP...
---
I asked for your numbers regarding how many of the new accounts are bots...
---
Idiot....
---
The Goon screeching and whining in this thread makes the whole thing worth while.
---
Raven is a weird case in my opinion. Sure it's an old model, but it (and  the golem) looks so good, I'm afraid of them changing it for the worse
---
1. There used to be salvaging sites. They were in the same category as Relic sites. But then they got... Scrapped.
---
2. I'd love to see more emphasis put back on Salvaging. 
---
- Specifically, I'd make a Sig that Core probes can detect again. Then you don't need an Expanded launcher to look for them. 
---
- The last wreck to appear on a grid starts a timer. After 1 hour, it spawns a Sig beacon (and all the wrecks turn blue). That way the original victor has 1hr to come back, and then scavengers have 1hr before it auto despawns after 2hrs anyway.
---
Well just leave it at that. But we have expressed our fears in the same way we did regarding the blackout.
---
The young are always unrealistic idiots.
---
not in test
---
also tired of hyperbole
---
When I was in RvB I had neutral salvagers/looters on several gates and would blue the wrecks as I roamed by (the tears were delicious btw).
---
Was thinking of putting some istabbed tanky haulers otw from Amarr to Jita and seeing what I can pull in a day.
---
ah yes, the calling of names when one has no defensible argument.
---
also childish
---
This, right here, is textbook CSM honeymoon speak. I'll be right here, waiting after the summit to see your spirit crushed.

Yeah sure and goontards also said the same shit about Incarna/monocles but here we are almost a decade later and EVE is still going.
---
You guys keep beating the same drum but times keeps proving you wrong. Get a new gimmick to peddle. Nobody's listening anymore.
---
The guy is an idiot that cant spin shit now.
---
I wish that the drops were a bit more worthwhile to be honest.  I feel like scrapmetal is a bit of a cop out, especially when you salvage larger wrecks.
---
Cap as in Capacitor, not as in Capital.
---
Crowd Control Productions put out a board game to fund the initial development of Eve. They probably weren't thinking about China at the time
---
"" which one is it, idiot " 
---
I'm not sure, you're the one not quoting numbers released by CCP in a devblog where they state their numbers are 12-20K TOTAL per MONTH not 10k NEW per WEEK.  You're the one who needs to make a choice.   
---
" I asked for your sources regarding how many of the new accounts are bots" 
---
and I asked you to reference that dev blog and you were the one who used a lot of words, but didn't actually link anything.
---
Yeah, you got nothing left...
---
Can't even keep your nonsense straight lol...
---
Most of these idiots are used to getting free kills from their intellectual peers. When confronted with someone who posses a three-digit IQ and isn't afk, they get confused and angry because they are denied the free killmail that CCP has led them to believe they are entitled to.
---
Unfortunately, CCP is sympathetic to their cause and is working to ensure that intelligence is neither a requirement for receiving killmails nor an effective tool for avoiding lossmails (unless said intelligence is used to win EVE).
---
Well one was the original and the other a friend gave me. They’re about to go in the trash with the rest of it since I need the space and it all just sits there.
---
Wich data you need to see? you only need to log in the game and see that almost all the activities are almost dead.  Only a total idiot cant see that...
---
derogatory term to describe players who only PVE. so for hunters all their victims are crabs
---
Its derived from crabbing meaning hoarding food. i think it started with Russian wormholers. Whatever word they use for pve content sounds like the english "crab". It caught on with other wormholers (namely hardknocks) and spread through the game as Hardknocks grew. It doesn't actually have anything to do with crabs. It's also "krabbing".
---
Tell me, in your own words, how Incarna ended.
---
Trying to twist things again huh, querns_idiot...
---
Did CCP cash out and close up shop? Nope...
---
Not gonna do it this time either...
---
You'll see... :)
---
Blocking you now, by little idiot goontard. Will love every day that you're proven wrong. :)
---
LOOL  wtf? haha ""If most of the PCU drop can be attributed to botter, cloaky camper, Rorqual 15-boxer, afk VNI 10-boxer etc. accounts; then the game might be just fine (or just not horribly worse off).""  W T F...
---
Sorry but? are you dumb or something?
---
Hang on, those aren't all Eve install boxes are they. Are those books? DVD? What is all that?
---
In HS they are hell of a lot more hidden than empty null. The only way to see if someone is a bot is by breaking them and you cant do that in HS. No they dont since they are alpha accounts. I doubt HS will get nerfed, it will get buffed, only way to actually raise retention rates.
---
I am talking about the effects on the economy. Isk value.
---
Okey Im gonna take this question seriously and respond to it in a similar manner. You are not vulnerable when you are aligned. Btw aligning only works for carriers/supers, the rest will drift outside of range which means they have to orbit. That alone makes sub cap ratting russian roulette. And you are speaking of a few losses here and there, you are disregarding that blocs constantly have 24/7 hunters which means its not just a couple of losses, its constant losses. 
---
But the losses aspect isnt the issue, its the lack of counter to a loss. Like I stated, this isnt isk/reward related, its the fact that chance is at play. Simply put what are the odds someone ganks me this time around and not can I get safe if people want to gank me. This is the issue.
---
And the aligned ships, carriers/supers. Most vulnerable when they land in a site, every good hunter knows this. You can easily scout one out, warp to the next site in system (which is easy to know, especially if you have eyes on him) setup a cyno inhib when he starts warping and light a cyno for heavy tackle.
---
GG. They only counter was local. There goes the tackle aspect and now the umbrella is getting nerfed which means your chance of getting help just got smaller.
---
Scouts, sure they work to a degree. But there are usually multiple gates to a system and you cant always watch all of them. But its still easy to get around, just log off for an hour. Log off traps have always been a thing and now they are just much much more dangerous. 
---
It doesnt even matter anymore. NS will die due to these changes. In a couple of months the only people around will be in pocket systems with backup everywhere. Content in most systems will be gone as you can already see on the ADMs on dotlan. The rest will move to HS. The content will be completely gone and the thing is, who do you think will go the next? Its the PvPers because no more content means no more reason to stay. It will create a massive cascade that will most likely kill the game within a couple of months.
---
Heres the thing that people have missed, we all needed eachother in this game. It should have never been PvPers against PvEers. And Im telling you this as someone who stands in the middle, I honestly never have to do anything PvE in the game ever again, I have more than enough isk. But I did it because it was playing the game. I did some industry, some explo, some straight PvE, some PvP, it was a package for me. 
---
Now all that is left if PvP and I dont have hours on end to just sit in fleets and on coms to find content. Solo roaming for me died with the blackout as well cause targets dried up, just empty systems all around. Small gang also did in a sense, atleast the types I would join. Its only big fleet PvP left but there is no real reason for me to do it because Im not enjoying the fruits of my labor.
---
The game just got boring for me, as did it with many other. We lost too many options. Thats why people are leaving, not because of risk. Because the package deal was broken, NS just became much much more boring that in used to be.
---
But, I can still do everything that I used to, granted probably with more losses which is fine. But I just have to put in so much more work for it and Im not gonna do that. Eve was already a second job, now it requires overtime. There are other games out there man.
---
Someone who doesn't buy money.
---
"good hunters" is an oxymoron, at least in the context of this game.
---
By "good" you obviously mean "skilled", and in this game, "hunter" means "someone who apparently can't handle challenge but wants to get kills anyways".
---
It's kind of like calling someone a good bench warmer.
---
won’t need to,
---
As usual when the “elite” pvp crowd find out it’ll be hard to hunt in the upcoming meta they’ll quit just like they always do
---
&gt;“elite” pvp crowd
---
Awwww poor bitter little boy.
---
Show me on the PvE ship where the bad players touched you.
---
Lmao what the fuck happened to you mate. Used to be a solid dude, now are randomly cry posting on reddit about horde like the rest of these idiots. Morons that are going around typing with heads up arses that conveniently double as an echo chambers. Replacing facts and logic with straight up drivel inducing accusations they find up there.
---
That's exactly what it looks like, but bent like you dropped it from a moving vehicle.
---
Two install disc. Original art book and new art book. The limited frigates book and some other limited ones with the lithographs. Comic and some of the playing cards. I’ve got a load the the card packs in another cabinet and the 3 original shop models. I have the 4th to a friend since he wanted it.
---
Avaren is a cunt.
---
I would fix it and the aeon by nerfing the fighter bay on the nyx/hel to their size.
---
Were you even playing this game during Incarna? You really have no idea what you're talking about. Like, nothing even remotely adjacent to an idea. All you have, in fact, is a flaccid hatred for Goonswarm Federation in excess of the norm around here -- quite impressive, that. Link your freighter lossmail, please.
---
The basic shape of the thorax should not be changed.  They could get rid of that protrusion though.
---
Hecate is fucking beautiful.  Navitas/Thalia got a pretty good facelift.
---
&gt; Goons 0 - PH(pamfam) 2
---
Okay, do you people actually put effort into being as stupid as possible? Do you get frightened when a rational thought pops into your mind, and then proceed to smash your head into the nearest wall until it goes away?
---
I'd like to think that that's the case, and that natural selection hasn't failed us so hard that people are still being born with so little intelligence that they can't understand that the blackout hurts legitimate miners and ratters at least as much as it hurts bots.
---
dont think he has logged in for like a year
---
but yeah he's a cunt
---
This is actually socialism, 
---
Communism would have the miners giving 100% of their ore to the alliance and being issues alliance owned ships and equipment
---
Why do you hate the dino carrying its suitcase so much?
---
The raven is such a sexy ship, thou i would like a HD lift to it.
---
Damn. Nice collection there
---
Yeah, I had forgot about that tbh, but it was removed to make armour and shield tanks more unique vs one another from what I remember
---
CCP is the Chinese communist party.
---
Thank you. I thinned it down a lot a few years ago. This is some of what survived. Time to get rid of it all I think. I still play but don’t have any of this on display anymore.
---
still no link supporting your claims, but somehow I'm the one full of "nonsense"... lol better luck next time kid.

I'm curious, what would you have rather seen Iron do, in their current situation? Unless you have a strategically better alternative, I'm gonna go with  you're just salty for the sake of being salty because someone pissed in your ice cream.
---
Does any other null alliance do as little for its members than Horde?
---
No. The answer is no. Remembers kids, SRP is for the weak! 😂😂
---
Waffles seem to be full of former 1337 players, who were probably bored by the blue donuts and all the cancer that comes out of being in a big sov entity. Way to go!
---
Classic advise would be uninstall everything Eve related, fully uninstall and reinstall video drivers, reinstall Eve.
---
 Could you be more specific? What do you mean by 'best'? Do you mean safest?
---
Just doo it!
---
Nulsec krabs will whine and tell you CCP killed tye game with the recent changes, but give it a try and see if it is true. To me wormholes are far more fun than my previous life in nullsec.
---
Every day you have new neighbors in the wormhole connections, every day different options to shoot at.
---
I think you're missing the point -- that even with all the reshipping in that BR, you add up all the ships and the mass doesn't come close to exceeding 3.6bil mass.
---
boy, hs corps get wardec when they do this to newbies ...
---
Mittens and Boat are such incompetent fools, surrounded by a very competent leadership.
---
Yes. That’s the joke
---
Cool
---
I think that having most resilient fighters and biggest fighterbay is too strong combination.
---
Thanks for reminding me that I own this and have some friends I can make play it.
---
So you accuse olmeca using a method, mittani is using forever and lots of lemmings are following him.
---
We have a guy who has decreed that your skill in smallgang PVP is determined by how many Sabres/Bifrosts/Stilettos you feed with your alt account, per day.
---
My record so far is 3 in one day, which is unfortunately a very inconsistent number. I am therefore not a highly skilled smallgang PVP pilot.
---
Someone like Intigo on the other hand is obviously a PVP god, because his alt account reliably feeds 3 or 4 Bifrosts every day.
---
yeh.. i'd love to see how drastically THAT has changed with the last 1-2 years.  
---
Honestly my bet would be something like 50%+ of players with more than 2 accounts
---
It’s been Pandafam vs Imperial Legacy from the beginning. 
---
Test wouldn’t be able to do much against Frat by themselves, so they’ve always been batphoning goons for major timers, and of course frat can’t do anything against test + goons alone, so they batphone Panfam.
---
Only a handful of people account for that, stop and think about it for a second. The rest just agree with the vocal, salty whiners on Reddit.
---
Morons like Mittens just spin it in the echochamber and their minions nod in brainless agreement.
---
It is also true some krabs have stopped playing, which results in some kind of emptyness when you roam. But in the end, when they were logging back in the day, it was impossible to catch them anyway. Subcap ratters will just align and warp when you are spotted on intel. 0 chance to get caught unless very retarded or afk.
---
Whenever they do pings for bomber fleets and only offer SRP for logi and the special ships, I always wonder where all that isk from their renters and the highsec market that they held for like forever solo and uncosted went.
---
(in TEST for example we do SRP for all pinged fleets thats not a roam and we have done that since we were a poor alliance. Much poorer than Horde should be atm. You're being scammed by Horde leadership, dudes)
---
Using one of the richest eve player as example. Mittani could use wyvern as a throwaway cyno ship :p
---
Yeah it's really weird because it's just a perception thing, not necessarily a population thing.
---
Have you ever looked at the algorithm they use for determining CSM election winners? It's a very interesting algorithm and it makes it surprisingly easy for lone dark horse candidates to win a seat.
---
Not going to comment on fairness of elections here because that's its own can of worms, but it was rather amusing this year watching Steve Ronuken knock out Sort Dragon by 12 votes in the final round.
---
I just use them interchangeably, apparently it used to be on purpose to annoy them but it’s lost that meaning a long time ago
---
The Mittani has time and time again presented numbers run by the people in our alliance who actually bother to run them. Olmeca consistently ignores stats and numbers and states his "feelings" as facts and that's a load of crybaby BS.
---
This data does not show how many bots or afk ratting farmers stopped logging, does it?
---
you ok hun xo
---
I am not looking for active subscribers or alts.
---
There could be wow levels of subscribers, it is irrelevant unless they log in and do things in space. Which, the data shows that they are not.
---
It is also irrelevant for "People in space doing things" whether it is 2 people flying 2 rorquals, or 1 person with an alt.
---
Did you expect pandafam to just drop in Titans despite being vastly outnumbered and having no hope of doing anything but feeding? 
---
Congrats, your leadership have managed to blue most of Eve, but that’s going to mean you get a lot of blueballs and not many actual fights, even if you can win wars.
---
Perfect! We need hard data’s and facts to make a good decision on this blackout. Everything else is bullshit.
---
Tapi is the abortion of this game
---
Complete cancer
---
80% of null comes down in full force, surprised to get blueballed by the rest.
---
Looking PCU speaks of reatrdedness. It takes very little IQ to remember PCU does not consider the bot and multiboxing farm chars that stopped logging.
---
Try and think...
---
Cool story, bro.
---
Should have told him about the blackout. Then he'd be here to read your lost connections post.
---
Someone whi actually gets it.
---
I know their intent, I only doubt if they are capable enough to do it.
---
Do you know how many of them were cancerous 10+ rorq multiboxers?
---
Mittani hasn't really personally generated EVE content in almost a decade now. He was the man behind the man who destroyed the Band of Brothers alliance ("The Mittani sends his regards"), he was the focal point of Goonswarm Federation back in that era before he got banned for a while after the Wizard Hat; but in the time since then he's basically just been a giant face who talks a lot and alternates between occasional moments of brilliance and a lot of koolaid. The GSF in-game content at this point is more run by the other GSF leaders.
---
However if you want to talk about non-EVE content... his image has developed into the cult-leader of the GSF and his speeches on things generate more circlejerk and rage on /r/eve than any other single person; and he gives speeches frequently enough that the flamejerk is nearly continuous.
---
So if people associated with olmeca, who are playing with him, or like you for mittani, just present numbers, they run by themself you would believe.
---
I bet mittani wouldn't, and he surely would find a excuse it's not so, even if he can't prove the wrong/or truth of his own words then.
---
Legit pushback there
---
Years ago scrap metal used to take up a lot more cargo space. I used to jettison stacks of it to make room for more actual salvage.
---
That sounds better honestly.  People are more incentivized to keep doing what they want.
---
Honestly, I'm not used to it. I go to fighting game tournaments and a few lan parties here and there for the pvp. I've always played mmos and have heard talk of EVE as being the best pvp ever. I'm starting to believe that it's all hype coming from a bunch of socially awlward middle aged Karen's  who've never actually had to pvp.
---
Wow..i took a minute to realise you were talking about cars...
---
People keep saying you can do it, but how the Ruddy hell do you skill-fu from the app?
---
Because CCP? Shut it down after login.
---
&gt;So if people associated with olmeca, who are playing with him, or like you for mittani, just present numbers, they run by themself you would believe. I bet mittani wouldn't, and he surely would find a excuse it's not so, even if he can't prove the wrong/or truth of his own words then.
---
we will never know, because Olmeca and his supporters don't present numbers, or hard verifiable facts. They present their "feelings" and their abstract opinions on the game as fact and demand CCP take that the same as they would a statistical fact.
---
yeah yeah, not like TAPI arent \~3 trill in the hole right now and spamming Reddit to creat a "we're winning" narrative. Source - ESI or whatever tracking system in place this whole time.
---
Eve is dead. After 5 years of loving this game, I'll be winning when my subs expire in a month. Don't waste your time and money.

Yes bro download Eve Portal app 2019

An alliance that large and with its economic backbone shouldn't have problems building an SRP cache without imposing rent on its members. If that's the line they're giving you, you're being lied to.
---
I meant as the ship he flies on his main in superfleets
---
I wasn’t part of this, but I imagine that the CDFE-rigged dreads were collecting dust as anti-caps and the pilots didn’t want or think to get new rigs
---
On my i7-8700k it starts at about 10% CPU while it's looking for patches/updates (the network traffic spikes as well) and then it stays around 1-2% for me.
---
I'm quite content being in my own alliance, where I pay no rent and am not required to conform to a bloc where I'd just waste away.
---
because CCP needs to tell you about the new mobile game and the sale on skill extractors.
---
Tayra and Badger, bring back the old models.
---
You should prove yourself right, this is basic profile that, for example, scientific community uses. 
---
Imagine everyone making some bs up and asking others too prove them wrong lol
---
Mining Bitcoins to get more cash from ramaning player base.
---
i mean, if i never interact with you, is there really a difference?
---
So they should only pvp in pre planned fleets?
---
They want to pvp in small groups. Manually piloting ships, people knowing what to do, etc. A lot of them would love it if you undocked similar ships to fight them. 
---
Sadly, people like to either give no pvp, or drop a full fleet or caps on everything, so everyone winds up bored and without kills
---
Have you tried only having the accounts part showing on the screen?
---
Tikles activity recently is what's actually disgusting.. What's happened to you guys :(
---
Figured the war with winter would've done you guys miracles
---
Good players because they press warp. Pog
---
Do you also align and anchor??
---
The Barghest fits. Capital fits I can understand, but not the completely passive 100mn torps. Is it just maximum brawling power with no capacitor reliance?
---
Its just are those extra accounts subbed?
---
You do know that the reason you stood no chance last time, is cause you decided to use a BS comp, went too hard on it, massed yourself, and thus couldn't get your dread in? You almost got our BS support off field, but didn't have dread pressure.
---
So, your response to having a mass heavy comp and failing to get it all on field, is to increase the mass of your comp and just wait in home?
---
Capitalism bad.
---
we don't.
---
just think about it, your vni and carrier bots are now broken but you still need isk to do stuppid stuff with or even to rmt, Highsec bots exsist so you'll just move your bots to there. 
---
the bots are still here, they just live in highsec now
---
So all the NS bots have moved to HS?
---
It's only easier on leadership because you guys apparently have no fucking idea how to run an SRP program efficiently.
---
Works on Honor 8 Lite. Which is not a particularly powerful phone.
---
most of them. Noizy gamer tweeted that the high and low sec activity went up (based on kills), and null sec declined.
---

---
I dont really get what you want to say here. Are you trying to say that fighting a lengthy war wont cost? And that TAPI isnt currently winning? 
---
Cause costs dont matter if you can handle it. Do you really think that TEST cant handle 500b/month in expenses for a war? When TTT alone probably provides much much more income than that in the same timeperiod. Not to mention the very fact that costs matter much less than content, especially if you can carry said costs.
---
And its not a narrative if you managed to place the hostiles homeregion under your own supercap umbrella. Its not a narrative that FRT are losing the war and have lost systems after systems, just check dotlan if you wanna talk about data. And its not a narrative that FRT has already evacced PvE assets to another region so they can survive.
---
These are simple facts and everyone involved in the conflict from both sides know this. TAPI doesnt need to create a narrative, they can just present reality.
---
I'm sorry but I feel I need to point out FW when talking about broken for YEARS!
---
Solid vid. Thank you for this

Don't you dare touch my beloved Drake!

Deaconsogood. Well done lads.
---
The feeling of that login screen when I first played at 12 was so magical. Really wish CCP brought back the mystic and “otherworldliness” atmosphere back.
---
It's wishing that people would act against their own obvious self-interest and the wishes are usually made by people who wouldn't dream of doing the same.
---
That Gnosis MJDs away when it does get targeted.
---
The problem is that mobility is so important in EVE, forcing yourself to go stationary just means capital guns can track you or you can get turboblobbed and alphad.
---
are they moving to period basis?
---
Since the word was invented almost 200 years ago, why?

Do you mean the spikes every X seconds when the UI updates? You can activate gpu acceleration in the launcher settings.

Poor thing :(

On the contrary, the openness of capitalism is something that the regime has to manage. Hong Kong is a good example of this. A totally controlled economy would be much easier for them to contain, but they want to growth and prosperity that comes from capitalism.

Galaxy Note 4 running Android 6.0.1. It's an older phone but it's got an Adreno 420 in it and so should work for minimum requirements for Unreal Engine on Android per the UE SDK website...

I mean I wouldn't bother contesting when you're fighting both max test and goons either, its an impossible scenario, which kinda shows the state of eve. (and the blue donut)

Corrupt Goon Capitalism is bad, but Free Enterprise is not when it is not corrupt. Socialism is just the extreme opposite of that where it is the Government goons controlling everything and stepping on the little guys.

---
Most of the larger cities in mainland China are designated economic zones, but(as I've seen/read) there's not much in the way of resistance. I think that Hong Kong and Taiwan are particularly special cases, due in fact perhaps to a post-civil war sense of nationalism and a reimagining of their national identities and values over decades(a bit of a tangent but it's interesting so I wanted to bring it up).
---
I must admit to being quite disingenuously quipy with my original comment. What I would really say is that I don't think that capitalism and authoritarianism are incompatible. That in fact they exist in parallel with eachother on the mainland and has birthed a backwards land of farmers into a modern industrial global powerhouse. Whether that is due to the wealth of resources and manpower that China has I'm not sure, but business is marginally healthy on the mainland(besides like ghost cities and that one time people invested all their savings into bikes, now there are just thousands of useless bikes everywhere).

This is reddit WTF.              
---
Do you mix EVE with RL and EVE with reddit?
---
Socialism is just as bad if not worse. And there is no such thing as capitalism, it is called Free Enterprise. it means if I have something you need and you have something i need, we can do a trade. Socialism will put all of that power in the hands of the Government and super-rich elite. Do you need something? Well get in line buddy because everyone else does too and there is not enough to go around. Do you need a life-saving surgery? Well get in line because you will have to wait and by the time you can get it done, you will be dead.

Rendering Falcon at that level of detail takes a lot of cycles.
---
I needed your comment for that
---
And youre really telling anyone that capitalism does not put the power into the hands of the super rich elite?
---
I do see your first argument though. Free market/enterprise is a very aspiring goal. However on a larger scale (read multinational coorporations) this system breaks exactly because of the very same reason communism/socialism failed: human greed.
---
CCP Falcon being on the launcher, it takes a lot of CPU to render his mug.
---
No way, the Imicus is by far the sexiest ship the Gallente has!
---
A dual T2 hyperspatial istabbed recon is a pretty fast moving ship, just saying.
---
I don't think CCP understand that their PVE content is shite. The only decent PVE activity is incursions and that's partly because of the reward and partly because it's a group activity
---
Huh. Never encountered imperium superfleets and I thought they preferred armor..
---
I am not sure if Mittani is one of the richest eve players to be honest.  
---
Also cyno changes will make sure that's no longer an option.
---
Easy wins with a strong fleet right on top of a weak enemy is one of the things they are trying to fix with this change.
---

Avatar and erebus, they look poo.

You will participate in morale boosting activities, CCP demands it

That's crony capitalism. It's what happens when there's too much regulation for the little guy in what's suppose to be a free market and too little for the big guy at the top. But when you let your country be controlled by the FED and their policies, laws stop mattering for those privileged enough to be part of the system.
---
"Put me in control of a country's currency and I care not who makes it's laws."

You just said something pro capitalism on Reddit. Get ready for the downvotes!

There is nothing I could add to that.

The opioid crisis, and monopolistic nature of ISPs, healthcare providers, cell providers are clearly demonstrative that, sans government intervention, all the money will be extorted by those at the top.
---
The opioid crisis was literally a case of "You don't need this, but i'm going to payoff everyone who should tell you otherwise, get you addicted to it, clean you and your insurance of every penny and leave you to die." Corporations are not people, they are self-serving, capital extraction mechanisms.
---
Do you think that people who create anything substantive should be paid? Do you think that those who don't should be required to pay?
---
The richest, most profitable business do not create capital, they simply accumulate it and move it around; without taxation, capital stagnates. A society based on incentivising the accumulation of capital is Capitalism
---
God dammnit, I expected something like this but not somthing quite like this! :D
---
That too. Cynos have many uses that make eve onsidedly easy.
---
It was never easy to get market data from Eves api. It is, however, now possible to do so.

---
Especially in 50km of bubbles next to 2 enemy fleets that will alpha him the moment he uncloacks, just saying.
---
Well but this is what capitalism evolved into... Marx' ideas about socialism were widely different from what was implemented by the ussr.
---
He want's it fast on grid.  A recon isn't going to chase down cruiser gangs.  As this change intends.
---
Just warp the recon to a cov-ops sitting in front of their fleet???
---
Fake , small gangs cannot kill caps as they are OP  
---
Read about it on r/eve.

Its ridicplous, and considering you have to buy at sell its even more.

Ah well if he tweeted it, surely it’s true.

I'll fix this. My buyback is making a come back

It's almost like both systems are good in principle and theory but human greed fucks it up...

Graffiti is pictures or words written without permission on a wall.
---
It doesn't have to be decent.

Writing "Anarchy in the UK" on a wall for example is still Graffiti...
---
Authoritarian regimes can, have and will continue to function in a capitalist system since they have the ability to engage in the market as a single entity, eliminating by force any competition within their borders they deem to be hampering their efforts. 
---
Ironically we've even seen this with countries such as the Soviet Union, ostensibly communist, engaging in the wider capitalist global economy in such a fashion even up to the point of controlling Warsaw Pact aligned economies in a similar manner by proxy.
---
To do this day more modern examples of course exist, such as the Saudis, China, Russia, DPRK, etc. All at varying levels of 'success,' depending on how you choose to define the term.

Marx was a drunk who bathed once a year and was generally seen at the time as an ill-tempered old fool who hated pretty much everyone. To understand Marx though you have to understand the world he came from. Unfortunately when all is said and done he made that world worse than had he just left it alone. To this day academics are fascinated with the ideology which is why young people are too. Professors are intellectually dishonest with their students and romanticize the atrocities that took place under the ideology he created which always morphed into something far worse in actual governments.
---
&gt; that have so little in life
---
And you are here :D
---
Would just like to have T2 salvage drones. I wouldn't mind trying out you're #3 suggestion though.
---
Pulsars have a bonus to energy neutralisers, so cap independent tank is quite important, especially when you will be up against a squad of Bhaalgorns. The AB is for transversal to minimise Anti-cap Dread application, Torps are for dank alpha/dps.
---
Then you can set up your own bait buy order as Horde leadership and whoever sells their ore publicly gets the bullet.
---
!Remindme 01/10/2019 Well fuck, end of month seems to mean 09-02.. Awkward
---
T2 punisher hulls look ridiculous They just glued some wings on and ruined the perfection of the original hull.
---
nice vid with nice music, always nice to see videos from small independent groups
---
The point is following a fleet and getting ahead of it
---
On the flipside you're also going to have people with a strong fleet gatecamping/blobbing and being able to fully avoid any sort of resistance with how blatant a recon cyno will be. I think cyno + bridge is required for the game to be healthy, otherwise you get stuff like P I R A T in highsec, camping with slaved + officer fit cloakies in pretty decent safety.
---
im not braindead im just a reddit bot &lt;3

Fit RSS probes in your launcher

Nullsec: Skill into a muninn. Done.
---
Go away and stop trying to ruin the potential fun for everyone else wanting to play this awesome game

PL has to fund all those new keepstars, sotyos an tataras somehow

And the lack of buffer mid because pulsar give extrashield HP
---
Your PI stuff is perfectly safe, but your space stations can be killed, meaning POCOs, structures and such.
---
Can I get some confirmation from a non-goon that this actually happens anymore? I'd be massively surprised if Mittens is worth shit in AT.
---
Condor / Crow / Raptor needs its left wing cut off and returned to its asymmetric roots.

You think a game where the map actually matters in more ways that jump ranges is a bad thing?
---
The USSR failed _because_ it tried to control every aspect of the economy. When you don't allow competition, you're not capitalistic. The more you do so the worse your economy will be (USSR, Venezuela, North Korea). China had many capitalistic reforms that gave it a lot of power and an increase of quality of life for its population. Once a company becomes successful they're "taking over" to manage the cultural influences and to line their pockets. The huge capitalistic industrialisation and increase in quality of life is a huge challenge for the communist party and (I hope) it's going to get harder for them.
---
Plenty of active battleships that can tank a HAW dread till downtime.
---
Subtle injector pay to win complaints?
---
Well tbh I am surprised that people aren't going after my jugular for a lot of the crap I said. So I am going to add what I think might help and this spiel will probably have a lot of people lose their shit in this subreddit (I am assuming). So going to spit ball here as I don't see black out as a negative if they fix the main issue.
---
What is the main issue you ask? Resource Scarcity. Whether it is isk, minerals, lp, and etc. So how would we fix this issue?
---
1. Give every person subbing with an actual credit card 1 billion isk per month to do what ever. Come up with some bull shit lore that the different factions is giving out the "freedom dividend" (see if Americans recognize that term lol). 
---
What is the point of this action you say? Get people less risk adverse and go pants on head retarded risky as the concern of having to grind those losses are gone. This community wants pvp will this will get you plenty of pvp as you can lose a few dozen frigates a day and more likely to log on possibly. 
---
2. Automate a lot of the grind. Allow players hardcore into watch rocks melt hire npc miners that cost isk hourly per miner that they can control to mine out belts if they are using a porpise or w/e. CCP seeds the market of these npc miners and the rates go up slowly by how many douche bags decides to kill them for lulz per week. People who mine themselves get quadruple the amount and put ore holds at the freighter level and tank them up significantly.
---
Mission grinders get triple the isk pay out and quadruple the lp payout, but standings grind rate stay the same and allow people to grind faction standings aka mission fleets allow one person to do the story line and everyone get the faction/corp benefits. Lowers the isk/lp costs by 10% at the lp store and add more items that can make the lp stores more specialized. 
---
With both of these changes we scale them according to risk. Empire sec you get the above rates, low sec double that shit, and null triple and start putting mission agents in null that does level 5's. What about wormholes? Fuck them. People were blown away the amount of isk being pumped in by that section and I am surprised many people didn't notice the recruitment adds after wormholes of claims if you join you can make 500 mill per hour easy.
---
CCP Sinks, all bpo's, skill books (yes even in the lp store), Corp taxes in a regressive rate*, npc's that player can control, plex ceilings that ccp seeds, alliance taxes regressive rate*, Citadels in high/low sec taxed per hour online or w/e, med clones with significant sp loss if we are going to keep injectors in, and w/e other shit this subreddit might run with it.
---
*addendum BPO Research goes up significantly in cost and time to research for another sink as well. Also seed T2 bpo's with triple the costs of T1 bpo's that are priced according to the stipend and research times/costs tripled.
---
Regressive tax rate = Price goes up if you want to dodge the npc personal income taxes and create a 1 man corp and goes down if you want to get as big as Dreddit/Karmafleet and ofc capped at a certain limit. Same applies for alliances. So if you can't pay and go inactive you will be put in an npc corp and taxed by npc's and if you fail to log on for a month the tax stops and all of this is applied monthly or every 30 days. Alpha accounts aren't counted to corp numbers for tax purposes unless they are plexed/subb'ed.
---
I had more in mind, but it is 5 a.m and I just started drinking uptime.
---
Now what is the crazy ass reasoning for these ideas? Well it just comes down that people by nature are risk adverse. All of these attacks on Goons, Test, and insert big coalition here for a blue doughnut is retarded. Humans tend to group up as they say safety in numbers, more so if you lost a bunch of ships during the week that you are either going to have to plex or grind with these artificial reductions ccp is putting in the faucets.
---
A lot of people are probably going to be butt hurt over "mai sim is ruined". Well this is a vidya game for one, two asking new players to invest time/effort/money to farm up for something that they can lose as soon as they leave empire, like a golem or barghest etc, they are going to pull up another mmo or vidya game instead.
---
My time playing Wow pvp that getting gang raped by people all the time isn't upsetting as the losses were nothing. Pvp was actually fun to some degree, but farming/grinding made me realize that I would have more fun dragging my ball sack across a mile of broken glass. 
---
Now could this shit works, maybe, maybe not. If there is anything I learned about policy research there is a lot of shit that crops up post policy release that makes you realize you fucked up (Iraq war and TPP etc). But my perception is that these changes people are harping about, CCP could switch it back and it honestly isn't going to start having an increase in numbers.
---
If CCP is doing Triv invasions with black out they already see the data that the company has been hemorrhaging customers. As CCP is definitely the type of company to not fix what is broken, but put in shit to get more players and milk them, while breaking the game in the process.
---
Also the numbers above is just figures I am throwing out. Debate and discuss what would be beast to solve the resource scarcity. Economy might get destroyed, I am skeptical as the economy isn't that sophisticated. If Blizzard gave a shit they can make the auction house region specific on those islands and you would still have ppl ferrying goods to those locations and sell shit.
---
Also, I have been working on my English and so if I can get grammar nazi's offer criticism, I would appreciate it.
---
 
---
Addendum 2* Fix Sec status, suicide ganking, and scamming as well as some of these offer little in my view to the game. Convince me otherwise.
---
Not really. The Chinese are manufacturing the world's goods yet the regular workers are essentially slaves owned by the CCP (the Chinese one, lol). Real capitalism is what you see in the US and Hong Kong where the regular people live affluent lives.
---
The Hong Kong youth are fighting for capitalism and freedom because they understand that the CCP's socialism = the nastiest of tyranny. Those little Hong Kong nerds protesting are some of the world's greatest heros at this moment.
---
A bling, implanted leshak can tank 3.5k dps with a bit of heat here and there. You wanna go for shit you can actually kill.
---
People using carriers are idiots, better to use a tristan for the drone dps
---
Agreed
---
its lowsec, use proc n porp
---
Ah thanks!
---
Thanks!
---
Just a quick update. 
---
GM says they didn’t register my login on a specific day, but I know 100% that I logged in, because I was coming back from an 8 hour bus ride and made sure to check my accounts before going to bed.  
---
They won’t give me the SP due to that reason, which I understand as a basic rule, but can’t accept knowing that this has to be a technical issue.
---
So hordelings will just use their own horde alts to sell to orders.
---
"any sort of resistance" except y'know...sub-cap resistance. ;)
---
jeveassets is also a great tool, i use it for maintaining stockpiles
---
Social score increased by 1!
---
Join goons, welp a hundred fleets, then get poached into a better alliance :P
---
Oh yeah, I remember magnetometric sites. Some of my earliest profit was living next to a lowsec pocket in Minmatarland and going into there to run mag sites.
---
I really like your last idea, making it turn into a scannable anom would be cool.
---
My memory in this game is not that old but IIRC in general these sorts of things tend not to go well for an alliance.
---
Example: CO2 [banned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6s96ws/epic_mail_from_co2_logistics_director_no_export/) the [export](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6saded/people_trying_to_smuggle_minerals_gets_awoxd_by/) of minerals outside Impass, followed by everything getting out of hand and the alliance collapsing.
---
Also... anyone that can get me an invite into their corp in case badmouthing leadership gets me blacklisted? 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I'd rather learn to be a good FC instead of welp fleets for no reason. I don't mind welping, but I'd prefer to get some blood on my hands in the process. (I have nothing against goons though, they fight like monsters when they get the chance)
---
Bringing a Loggerhead isn't exactly standard either though...
---
The hype for best pvp in eve were prior to the changes CCP made which destroyed most of the small gang engagments  
---
also as stated in the comments, legacy is the 2nd biggest coallion, who is blue to the biggest coallion (39k members + 41k) to vs one coallion (Winterco, which is mainly just 1 alliance)  
---
it's no suprise to anyone that there was no fight to be had  
---
the golden time of eve was before the age of the true blue donut
---
Well every welp is a learning experience.
---
Hunter tengu again eh
---
I mean. for the last 2-3 years. i wouldnt be surprised if the number was like 60% with more than 2.. and of that. atleast 30-40% that have more than 3.  
---
Whether they are subbed NOW? now that they have a giant pile of isk and isk isnt as stupid safe to make as it has been the last 3 years? dunno, why have your 15 farming alts subbed when you dont need them, and you might actually have to PAY ATTENTION every once in awhile.
---
I mean if you're buying ships at sell price and earning bounty minus tax it's the same difference, the only reason this is ridiculous is cause it's 30%.
---
Im unsure about if the cyno changes are good or no.. Cyno being prohibited on caps = good but cyno only on 300m+ ships = errrr...
---
Afk has balls and brought a faction dread. Novac pulled a dog move.
---
What else is there to discuss?
---
ITT EVE players love communism. Makes sense with the new phorde announcements.
---
Communism bad guys
---
Yeah, CCPLS. We totally need to be able to bridge 50 feroxes on top of that nasty thirax, roaming our space.
---
Instant presence on the map is something bad for the game, imo. The chase, the hunt, outmanouvering your foe, lookijg for your foes on the map is the thrill. And you have jump bridge grid everywhere anyway.
---
Well, train recon alts and use them for that.
---
Get ready for structure bash or blueball fleets. So much fun and so much win!
---
Say the margin in jita between buy and sell on minerals is 10%, then theres the value jump in that minerals are more valuable than ore when calculated, you loose much more than 30% by being forced to sell and buy.
---
What's the bustard for?
---
Implying Horde didn't stripmine eachother's corpses already
---
Well not trying to be rude but, if youre doing youre first fleets they most likely will be welp fleets. However, welp fleets dont meant that you wont kill anything! Take out 20-30 cruisers and head over to GE-, if youre joining goons.
---
Horde will also let you lead fleets if you join, no doubt, probably as good a chance as goons. If you wanna go without joining any big alliances, you could fly a bit with spectre fleet and run some fleets for them once you get the hang of the normal etiquettes.
---
he played in the last AT to mess with peoples heads, worked flawlessly
---
For hunting: cov ops cyno T3 -&gt; blackops (-&gt; mjd) -&gt; caps
---
Eh, I bought one anyway. :)
---
r/evejobs is the sub for recruitment. Dreddit is the new player Corp for Test if you want to rejoin them.
---
https://m.twitch.tv/videos/290208712?t=03h53m14s

It's from ATXVI
---
 "T3Cs will be able to utilize interdiction nullified"  
---
This is precisely why its not gonna happen. And its good that ccp finally decided that nulli cyno is pure bs.
---
right. thanks for the info i'll check it out!
---
I assume a 4-thread (2 or 4 core CPU), in which case it means the launcher is consuming 100% of one core.
---
Genuinely surprised that a. He did that and b. It impacted anyone's performance.
---
Just checked on my machine, its using literally zero CPU and like 133k of ram. Which means you need a new computer.
---
Yeah joining horde soured me on the game a bit. So nepotistic. Kind of felt a little too like real life orgs. Are all big alliances like this?
---
&gt; Time to get rid of it all I think.
---
ill gladly take it into my collection if you dont mind
---
so you want to keep the ability of a heavier doctrine being able to remove all speed advantage of a lighter doctrine?
---
Exactly
---
Basically if you do any PvE then you're a lowly carebear to the extent that the elitists would have secondary accounts to make money on so they can keep pretending they don't do any krabbing at all.
---
Errot 404, argument not found
---
if covert ops sub-system fitted only covert cyno, if that sub-module not fitted, then normal cyno possible...? just a thought.
---
It would only take one to take advantage of the situation. The blue donut exists because someone else has one. And if no one has one. Then you'd be foolish to not be the first to go get one.
---
Actualy V.E.G.A. didnt even batphoned us. We waited on another timer and saw some movement in that pocket so we decided to have some quick fun.
---
&gt;Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) is an antibody present in most rheumatoid arthritis patients. Levels of anti-CCP can be detected in a patient through a simple blood test. A positive anti-CCP test result can be used in conjunction with other blood tests, imaging tests, and/or physical examination findings to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis.
---
So, they're just fighting against arthritis, I guess. Technically, arthritis may be caused by the wrong Lifestyle, and this is basically the definition of Eve gameplay process
---
Apkpure is like a alternative appstore. You can download it from there.
---
How are you removing their advantage ?! They still outmanoeuvre a drop, be it burning away or crashing gates. In your territory the defender still has 0 fatigue ansiblexes to get infront of you.
---
the crack in the armor about hard facts is in every statement from players, and on top of them mittani's, since he also has no numbers and verifiable facts. That's what only CCP has.
---
I have been successfuly running DED 3/10 and 4/10 sites, it's profitable for me because faction module loot..  
---
Now I'm going to upgrade to omegas, and planning to train salvage drone for additional income..  
---
Is there any source of information of how much we get from salvage, it seem I can't find it anywhere, like how much bounty should rats have determine it profits or it is pure luck like loot..
---
This line of thought is totally retarded, you have two players , one has a few ships he likes to fly all fit and sitting in his hanger, his pal only has the one ship cos he cant afford to buy a new one.
---
Of the two who do you think you have a higher chance of meeting in fun PvP ?
---
Players with low assets and low isk, and who are now struggling to make any kind of decent income are now less likely to go on a roam and lose the one ship they have left, meanwhile his pal Mr Money bags with 5 of his Favourite ship is far more likely to take a few out and get them blown up because he knows he can replace them.
---
iPhone 7 here it runs fine, maybe it’s time for a new phone :P
---
Adding alpha clone skills would be nice
---
Damn never thought I'd see the day PL begging CCP for help
---
You can download it trough Apkpure!
---
People were giddy with excitement to see me suffer when i was the poor guy. Now i am numb to it.
---
But that vet with all the assets and earning power ruins the economy by never actually getting anything destroyed just accruing more assets. Soon there will be no game for the poor guy. What then?
---
TBF it was never feigned
---
So a no go on my phone. I guess later they will get around to an app for Motorola flip phones....maybe? Lol.
---
No I don't use a flip phone, but I have one for places I go work wise that don't allow a camera to be on site. The guards don't even ask they just say "Ok" even tho it has a camera.
---
Should have tried to awox him and get his stuff.
---
Basically "undue a huge part of the Nerf".
---
How about let's see how it goes first?
---
Maybe next time don't logout when your probes are still in space?
---
Not if it's a testing app.
---
It isn't listed at all.
---
Possibly also this mentality of sitting in a staging citadel until a cyno goes up somewhere.
---
[https://apkpure.com/eve-echoes/com.netease.eve.en](https://apkpure.com/eve-echoes/com.netease.eve.en) and here you go. I am playing since yesterday and it works fine.
---
The blackouts will continue untill morale improves
---
Nope, we're still staged in ge-8jv for catch, a lot of people have moved to our space in Impass since the blackout has made any krabbing in Catch difficult
---
Even after a month, I still have no idea what you meant by this.
---
Super valuable input. You are the best pc master of all time. Clearly.
---
I always carry two sets, after some of mine went missing.
---
remove local everywhere. problem solved.
---
Always carry two sets of probes just in case you lose a set. Also comes in handy in the sense that your launcher reloads automatically with the next set
---
you misspelled Infogrames
---
can I have your stuff?
---
You should look at average usage.
---
Yes, it peaks at 25% on my 10 year old Phenom II x4 (so possibly its just fully utilizing a single core) but its average cpu usage over 60 seconds peaks at 4% (only during one of those 25% usage spurts. Generally its closer to 0.1% over a 60 second period).
---
Now, yes I should look at a longer averaging period to get a better number, but I'm just glad anything still runs on my 10 year old Phenom II x4.
---
Yep, live and learn. Will always carry two sets now!
---
Ph have three reasons why they are good for this.
---
1: any one can ping for a fleet. On day one you can ping and get 60 beans in your fleet no issue. There is also constant opportunities to ping response fleets for new fc's, our "good fight" space is one of the most high traffic  zones in the game.

Thanks mate. I am sure my curiosity about EVE will take me back to this sub reddit from time to time.
---
I didn't meant that you should not speak out in general, but this video snippet was clearly meant as a provocation. Best way to deal with such a provocation is to ignore it. That's an honest personal advise. Talking of koolaid when he is talking about player numbers just gives the impression that your on your brand of koolaid.
---
On other occasions you should represent your position calmly. We all want some changes but is really everyone who doesn't agree with your vision for the game on koolaid?
---
The eve launcher seems to schedule verify passes on its download cache, but it also downloads, unpacks and apply updates in the background so you always have an upto date game. It could have just been running one of these processes when you checked.
---
Im sure ur always welcome back :)
---
just careful with the salt mines here, Ull probably need Salt Mining V and Salt Harvesting V to deal with some people here XD
---
due to the size of their superfleet they can afford to do both. last one ive been on was 9-4 in the shield super fleet with my Hel and The Mittani (pbuh) was in a Wyvern and constantly complaining in fleetchat about the terrible delay on fighters in max tidi
---
We really didnt and people pushing this meme openly in test are likely to find the door
---
I would like it but I'm pretty sure they considered it as it's one of the most obvious options. So kinda waste of time to propose.
---
Well you know he's either going to be bait tanked or 0-tank heavy DPS. Probably depends on what result he rolled just before hopping in to the ship.
---
Their current situation is afk leadership, and main FC who prefers to fly with blues rather than Iron guys
---
If there's no surprises why would it impact anyone's performance? Seems like a lack of imagination
---
U foking twat
---
Would love to listen to the SOTA, see how Tridgit spun this lmfao
---
Does Horde now ask for full ESI access? What happened there? I thought you didn't need any ESI at all to join them.
---
Every big alliance (and small) will be centered around "who can you trust" so friends gets more access than people that leadership don't know. 
---
That said, if you want a space job, thats easy to do and then you can just work your way up there.
---
Most big alliances are better at managing it than Horde tho.
---
My best find was a blue tengu wreck sitting on a gate somewhere out in the boonies while running the sisters arc. Easiest 500mil I ever made.
---
Should have mentioned, only one FC any others who claim to be an FC are shit tier
---
Fair play to ehefkae for playing the game right, and fair play to novac for responding. Looks like that was challenging for both sides.
---
Exactly this, WELCOME TO THE NEW AGE!
---
You think we aren't there, but we are just sitting on the side like vultures waiting for the fight to finish. Then we swoop in and loot the carcasses! Thanks for leaving 1b in loot for us!
---
Not mixing your tank is hardly knowledge specific to capitals
---
The real question is balls?, stupidity? or bait?
---
Sounds fun lol. I keep trying to find drifter holes and have a look inside them, but Whenever i find one im always trying to do something else and i cant be bothered lol. Is there anything special thats inside?
---
dont you dare touch the drake, its PERFECT
---
Yes, safest, a place where you can have all you loot
---
Yes, because "you need a new computer" is a valid answer. If someone wanted to tell me I have an issue with my machine (I don't), I would not respond the way I did. Saying WHOLE NEW MACHIN LUL is just dumb.
---
Wouldn't it be *horrible* if cruiser gangs could reliably be intercepted by massed capitals.
---
* shudder *
---
*The **horror***
---
I'm fine with the models as they are in terms of shape, even the imicus, but on older models the textures are way, way to obvious and the ships seems 'carved' into shape, e. g. the thorax, its outer armor and inner hull seem like one thing where imo they should be different and easily told apart
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
That would be an NPC station (the ones that look like a square on your overview) in lowsec or highsec. They can't be conquered or destroyed, so your items will always stay there. And if it's in highsec, you will always have easy access to them.
---
Haven't done much exploring yet, but there's eye candy...

Why are HS+LS added together? they are vastly different areas of space mechanically. I'd really like to see a graph with those separated out.
---
Thanks !!
---
Mixed highsec lowsec regions. I assume he works based on regions.
---
Ooh!! Now it's there! It wasn't last I checked!!!
---
ah, that's a good point. It may be impossible to separate them out then. Pity because I would have loved to see it.
---
why would they stop logging in?
---
if your boss said you have to do something a slightly different way but you're still going to get paid - would it really bother you that much or would you rage quit your job because it changes a little bit?
---
pressing "start bot" in high sec really isn't that much of a change to pressing "start bot" in null sec.
---
Nice graphs. Some interpretation help would be nice. For example some vertical lines for some expansions/changes. (I'm sure nobody will be over it in regard to blackout. ;P) Also some noticable wars might be interesting to add. Or for highsec when burn Jita was.
---
yea i know :( . Its a lot more work to do but if these wil get enough interest i will do some more improvements. And ISK valuse destroyed too. But we will see :)
---
It's fairly easy to scout the type of gang needed to pressure a slaved prot/loki/etc if they have to gate to you.
---
&gt; It's kinda ridiculous how they tend to turn sub-mode on so it just becomes a list of people agreeing with everything the mitanni and boat say
---
it's literally just the last 15 mins, it happens every show - it's a perk of being a subscriber.

trying to pretend that's some conspiracy is hilarious.

oh man, thats the one I started with iirc, 2009ish?
---
not impossible but some more work for me. just shared with u what i managed to achive so far

Lol.

Into the dumpster.
---
 Seriously considered this one..
---
Lol I left Eve. .I'm getting google adsense adds now for an eve app that lets you buy plex from android.. #eveisdying
---
Or maybe they are purposefully not allowing interdiction nullification cynos so you have to position cynos strategically instead of being able to just make it appear where you like, giving battlefields some terrain with bubbles etc as they would with a subcap fleet (bar slippery Petes etc).
---
Yes the defender already on grid gets a big advantage, however again maybe this is by design.  For bashes it will mean getting into position earlier.
---
I watched this whole show.
---
First off Mittens talks about only using facts, then they claim that buying three Vanqs costs $60000. I wanted to ask in chat where that number came from, as my brain is old and addled and I likely messed up, but the stream was in ~~propaganda~~ subscriber only mode for this particular declaration.
---

---
Now I understand that these are the smartest and most vigilant data using people in the entire game, and I'm just one salty boi, so maybe someone can find my error? Boat implied he'd verified the working afterall. I've erred on the side of the total being too high rather than too low in my calculations on purpose.
---
\- The two Vanqs lost were 354b and 320b. Let's say the third cost 354b too. Total 1.028t (Note, the stated cost in my clip is 200b)
---
\- The amount of ISK you can get for a rapid sale of PLEX is around 3.6m. It would have been more a couple of months ago, but let's use that figure to err on the side of caution.
---
\- 2860 PLEX is £84.99 which is $103. I'm guessing it's normally $100 in internet accepted units, so I'm going to use that. If you want to add 3% onto the final total, be my guest.
---
\- Amount of PLEX needed to generate 1.028t ISK = 1.028t/3.6m = 285,556
---
\- amount of $100 bundles to generate 286,556 PLEX = 285,556/2860 = 100 
---
Total money to get 100 bundles = 100\*$100 = $10,000
---
My thought is that the true number is $6,000 given the comment about the Vanqs costing 200bn, and Goons multiplied it by 10 for propaganda purposes. My fear is that I've dropped a zero in my workings somewhere. If it is the former though, they should get their own house in order before claiming to be using data in a meaningful way.

Why does the Android version contains Oculus and other VR related libraries? Are you planning on anything VR related? 
---
If not, removing those would most likely alleviate a number of potential issues.
---
What happened summed 2016 to cause that big dip?
---
That's kind of sad, why didnt you join in and brawl it out?
---
With the calibre of triage pilot you guys have, having a regen triage is a massive advantage. You've adapted your nighthawk fits too and we don't really 1-shot them anymore. We put together the fit from ship scans and that dread would not have broken it. That's just my speculation though.
---
I'll gladly take the next fight into your home if I am around.
---
Join a small alliance (If those even exsist anymore) FC for them. Learn how to FC by actually doing it. Don't follow  some step 1-12 bullet note guide on how to FC. There are some basic fundamentals, but don't try to emulate or copy this or that FC, you just end up a shitty clone that does it worse trying to emulate someone else. Fly cheap ships, you'll die.. alot.
---
Don't listen to people shittalking around here. You can still find interesting content in cheap ships, as long as you're willing to deal with a bit of work and dowtime, I personally tried the handing-ships-out method [with Spectre Fleet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqF5uNnnQpI) and had a decent amount of success with it.
---
Get out there and do stuff :)
---
Theres a good argument to put cynos on hictors but not t3s.
---
Would you consider reshipping into arty nados fair game, if you were fighting in someone elses home?
---
I like it, it makes it feel more uncertain and more space-like. There might be a 250 man fleet lurking somewhere in the system :)
---
If you consider a Jeep wrangler a car...
---
What do you consider it to be? A truck? A ship?
---
Where is the good fight zone! 
---
Asking as that sounds fun
---
The Android version says it targets Android Lollipop (5.0) as the lowest. Android 7 is not that old and it's not the issue here.
---
You are one butthurt motherfucker, fine i'll bite... As you probabbly (don't) know France has a homicide rate of about 1.3 per 100k, compared to you favorite USA at 5.3 per 100k. I'd also take my chances in a country where the worst that can happen is a"knife attack" opposed to some maniac wielding an MK4A1 mowing down people, but heeeey... pretty sure your brain is already atrophied from living in there... USA! USA! USA!
---
Good.
---
The fuck is an mk4a1 you pussy?
---
A Jeep is a Jeep.  It's not a car, it's not a truck. Trust me, us Jeep guys are very clear on this 😆
---
nice graphs, would be nice to see the drop in lowsec kills after passive moon mining was removed
---
Hahaha, thanks for explaining. Also which race is it? Caldari?
---
Lol at the guy who thinks he has no requirements to conform to anything.
---
My welcome what
---
It’s lxq
---
Between the typical rust and the half asses trail repairs, definitely Minmatar!
---
But they aren't nerfing covert bridges?
---
Yes, I do, actually.
---
It more often than not uses the same CPU usage as 5 clients for me.
---
FC is a very self-starter oriented sort of role. If you want to learn how to win, your best bet is to join an alliance with good FCs and get into their FC training program so you can both call for fleets and listen in to other FCs in their command channels. I've found that it's very difficult to split focus between FCing and trying to explain to a mentee my decision making process, but if you take notes and ask a lot of questions after the fleet, you're likely to learn a lot. From there, start running your own with the experienced FC backseating you and offering critiques and coaching. You can learn a lot just by doing, but you'll learn a hell of a lot more if you can get under the wing of someone with years of experience and who knows how to build a winning record. 
---
Nobody has a perfect win rate but off the top of my head, you'll find FCs who really know how to notch wins in groups such as We Form Volta, PL, FRT (specifically Elo), and to a lesser extent NC, Test, Goons, or PH. The first two mainly choose fights they can 3rd party or gank with advantageous intel situations (i.e. not easy to get a spy in, but they have spies everywhere else). The last five have FCs with worse win percentages, though I'd argue in large part it's due to circumstances - they own more contested space and have more soft targets to defend, so they're sometimes forced into FCing from disadvantaged positions. 
---
Init and a few other groups come to mind as well for having solid FCs although I don't know how easy it is to get into Inits training program compared to the other large blocs. I mostly have experience with Test, and the people who do well there are the people who have the time to take out lots of fleets, fill various support roles for other FCs, and ask a lot of questions. Additionally, you'll want to vary your experience between small group pvp and large fleet fights. They are very different beasts but there's good cross training to be had.
---
Cyno up , enemy lock, you volley him ... and like 1/3rd or 1/4th of enemy jump in just under your guns.
---
Are EWAR ship (looking at T1 crucified for example) are viable for PvE ? Where the damage come from (drones or turret?) If drones then better arbiter I guess.
---
Thanks.
---
Also, are navy frigates a real upgrade? Looks like a chore to get one.
---
Awwww it's so cute how you don't even know anything about my playstyle, but you make assumptions just because I disagree with your whining. &lt;3
---
What cpu are you running?
---
It frequently uses the same CPU usage as 5 eve clients for me, which is ~25% CPU on my laptop. It's a pretty high end machine, but even if it weren't the fact that a static image of someone's face somehow takes more CPU usage than a fully 3D game is kinda ridiculous.
---
Have you moved to C5 space to try out the brawl meta there for your FAX fix?
---
Yeah.  Same
---
Fuck the changes, staying docked has always been a "tactic" in this game. Can you imagine playing a fighting or fps and NOT fighting was considered a smart move? You'd be known as a bitch. But somehow the weirdos with downey frowneys make up excuses as to why it's a smart move in this supposedly good pvp game. 
---
If Legacy and Imperium are the number one and two corps, where the fuck are three, four, five etc etc?  And if the general consensus is to be believed, both alliances are full of retards. Well, retards can always be outsmarted and outplayed.
---
Don't give them ideas.
---
Dital
---
Stay in lowsec. You will feel much better about getting to know each of the members in your Corp and building a functioning team with them.
---
There are plenty of opportunities to FC in FW lowsec.  I think your problem is that you aren't logging on when all of the other people in your Corp are logging on.  I pick corps with 100-200 people.  There should be about 10-20 people on comms during that corp's peak hours. I check the timestamps in zkill to confirm a corp I'm looking to join is active and the time that they are active lines up with the time I wish to play.
---
Use Wormholes.
---
With Local removed from NullSec, a Wormhole will allow you to enter 1 system free from being scouted by the streamers sitting cloaked on gate.
---
That lock and volley time is still short than cyno and jump time, especially if there are multiple cynos.
---
And u less you can now alpha off most of the fleet that did land, the rest will be there in a moment.
---
This is actually a good mindset. Whelping just makes you better at whelping more.
---
Yeah no
---
thanks for sharing.  
---
is this an open source way of generating images? Wanna share that, too? :P
---
nice, and i am still waiting for my 6 careeragents stuck and unable to do them for 12 days... 
---
lucky you :D
---
I wouldn't really worry so much about me, considering the CSM summit is now. :sun:
---
Use Thera
---
Ahh, that explains it. I was tapping around like a madman on the old one trying to figure out where they hide the skill que feature.
---
Wow, someone's been bottling that up for a while.
---
Just isk for the estimated market value.
---
You sound like you're actually hurt that someone would be mean to you on the internet.
---
How very carebear of you.
---
It's mining plex, best to close it.
---
In the loft I've got the 2003 case, I think the disc is inside... Need to check
---
This. There is a site somewhere that updates all the Thera connections for your convenience.
---
I was wondering about using Thera yeah... but I'm not sure :(
---
I’d suggest fiddling with the launcher settings. Hardware acceleration on/off etc. Makes no sense that mine takes 0 cpu and others are getting lagged by it.
---
...and that friends was how it happened that Code came to Perimeter. Fat loots were had by all One and all and Concord got all the killmarks.
---
No buff needed. It has been in a constant state of deflation for years now, with the sole exception being "contaminated" stuffs due to upwell rigs. 
---
It is almost invariably true that if you have a favored way of making isk you should never ask for your dream buff to it, it will only deflate out of its current state of relevance.
---
But muh blackout... there so many more people dying in null sec!
---
T3Cs are already the most versatile ships in the game and one of the most popular ships in general. I don't think it's such a bad idea to force people to fly a bigger variety of ships yeah
---
You got two choices:
---
1) everyone here saying their launchers use trivial resources are lying, misguided, or are playing on supercomputers 
---
2) it's your machine 
---
Pick one
---
Yes, we could all be under the rule of PIBC BOB, with their T20 loot and GM loot events.
---
Ewar is rarely used in pve, it’s almost always better to use a dps ship than a ewar one, simply because in pve there’s so many ships that using ewar in each one is harder than just bringing more dps or tank.
---
 Most of the navy frigates are very good, and a substantial upgrade over the t1 versions, and because of that, they can run 5x the cost of a normal frigate, wether that’s worth it to you is up for you to decide.
---
How were the trends in null sec unsustainable, and what evidence do you have for the claims?  What trend even?  If you bring up PLEX your argument is immediately invalid.
---
you use to be solid too and then you went max power trip like the rest of horde leadership :D
---
Are these not [triglavian killmarks](https://i.imgur.com/YWDhImT.jpg)? This is on my kiki. Maybe the lashak is bugged...
---
N-6 in Great Wildlands is a nice Freeport, well stocked market. GW itself is rather empty for the most part but you have so many connections to other regions.
---
Alekseye and the rest of Capitalist Army do frequent nano gang roams as well, with no obligation to join them.
---
It’s very easy to supply with a dst alt or you can even use freight services. You don’t really need to scan, just put an alt in Signal cartel and copy the bookmarks. Do not use the top station (paleo) as it can often be camped. You can also have a clone there. It’s easier than most npc null and much better content. Pure blind npc used to be decent staging when horde and gotg were there but it’s pretty dead now. Dittal used to be not bad but provi is more or less dead as well.
---
Goons didn't uncover the T20 scandal, they just used it to their advantage to rally people against BOB. But goons have not been shy about using CSM to gain advantages in the game.
---
Say what you want about BOB, but at least they didn't have a media website ring to make money off of creating EVE content.
---
All seem to be trending down, but could also part of that time of year.
---
It's a Pokemon.
---
That's what I care about. Gimme my hunter tengu.
---
OOF
---
Im on an actual offensive deployment and don't have access to jumpgates
---
Salvage is partially based on chance, partially based on the wreck itself, so a bigger or more advanced wreck will drop more salvage. Also I think rat type determines salvage, like serpentis have a chance to drop contaminated Lorentz fluid. [this forum thread from 2015] (https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/5514293/) explains why predicting salvage loot isn’t accurate enough, so a calculator would just be way off all the time.
---
Reminder of CCP's Data:
---
&gt;Average Null Sec Tick: 270m isk
---
By including data all the way back to 2009, you've squished the relevant data 6 months pre-blackout through current day, post-blackout) into a tiny part of the far side of the graph and made it very hard to see the before/after context.
---
Have all of these graph but only show 2019 data.

If this makes you feel better, the last time I played EvE (early 2017) the launcher would utterly annihilate my piss poor DSL connection while doing precisely nothing.
---
A normal state of affairs was as follows:
---
Launch Launcher, everything fine
---
Launch Game, bandwidth disappears, browser response times slow to a crawl, character select could take 30 seconds to 1 minute to load
---
Play Game, 500-1000ms response time in game, browsers cease functioning, internet radio dies, every other device on the network thinks the internet no longer exists
---
Alt-F4 the launcher, disaster subsides, ping returns to normal, DSL connection becomes usable again
---
In summation, the launcher has been absolutely fucked for a small subset of the player base since its creation. Good luck.
---
If you mean fanfest 2016 sure, these are old as fuck.
---
ahah yeah, it was an intended plot twist :)
---
Ah i see, thanks for sharing that forum link. I think I'm gonna stick to not salvaging them and focus on getting to next sites quickly.

His  biggest achievement was taking credit for a disgruntled director disbanding Band of Brothers. That's all he does, other people around him do things, then he presents himself as the mastermind behind everything. It was interesting and funny in 2008, then he disappeared for 10 years and now that GSF is #1 he's back again to take credit once again.

Portable UE4 micro instances are non-trivial for a company with ccp's level of UE4 knowledge.  They would have to use a custom tailored unreal packer, which is not that hard, but they would not have done the required QC for production release probably.

I might look into the possibility of repacking the app since I have some pretty deep UE4 knowledge.

blackout should be wandering seasonal thing, that moves randomly to different areas of null and it can influence wars and so.
---
also a lot of people came and bought 1 year subs and real damage wont be seen till 1 year later. so they can try experiment and thats why they did it in summer. if they did this in winter, boy would the game be so screwed

Consolidating with our blues/abandoning sov and moving into the great unknown/reforming into a new corp/moving into a wormhole/join another small-to-medium alliance that is at least somewhat shares our values - literally anything but joining goons, really.
---
The battle was amusement pure.
---
Imagine giving a fuck about wormholes whatsoever.
---
Imagine when jumping in 2 carriers was considered "dramatic".  Now players don't blink when someone jumps in 200 Titans. 
---
Players clamor for "Eve Classic" but want to cry when CCP nerfs the I win button of their "End Game Ships" because they've "earned it".  What a time it would be when committing capitals would actually mean something and dropping a couple of Titans would elicit "OMG a Titan" again.
---
I believe the respawn on them was nerfed.

&gt;ld prefer if CCP keep the blackout and make Eve MUCH more dangerous B
---
Right, think about this for a minute. 
---
1. Bots are related to RMT; or, in other words, BOTers set up bots to farm isk to sell for money on third party websites. Botters thus make a living through botting;
---
2. There are *many* ways to bot in the game beyond nullsec ratting. For example, there are level 4 mission bots, there are courier mission bots, there are level 5 mission bots, there are even faction warfare bots;

So your argument is that the people who make a living botting, because of the nullsec blackout, just decided "oh hey, I guess the way I pay my rent got totally shut off in null sec, therefore I will quit RMTing and get a real job," instead of just moving to high or low sec where they can continue making a living botting. 
---
Makes *perfect* sense.
---
till october when he also gets a performance bonus based on past years performance. maybe they sack him after that maybe not, but kpis till october are all he cares about
---
Message Susurrus Synaesthesia in game. We're recruiting, and you can FC with me till we get you your stripes!
---
&gt; Blackout or cyno changes aren't injecting cash to CCP or filling the game with short term accounts and profits. 
---
try again. Blackout brought a lot of pvp players back and many subbed for year, which will increase short term accounts and profits
---
same with cyno changes as people will skill inject into recons to keep their logistical chains to null, which again will increase short term accounts and profits
---
whoever leaves because of blackout, and even the resubbed people leaving because there is no content in null, will not be visible for another year
---
3rd/4th link in the OP is what you are looking for
---
If that was legitimately all he cared about, he wouldn't be pushing for this changes now. 
---
I honestly believe that he thinks that this changes are good for the game, but as i said, the motivation for these changes are probably not data driven, and more likely driven by the common narrative pushed on reddit by the vocal veterans here, basically, people here on reddit over the years convinced him that this is the way to go to fix eve, and started giving marching orders based on said narrative.
---
Great work. I assume you added the total number of kills for the different regions? And if so what is the timespan between the datapoints?
---
Is it as profitable?
---
NO! DATA IS KOOL-AID! GOONS ARE BAD BECAUSE I SAY! WORMHOLES ARE THE BEST! THE EARTH IS FLAT! EVOLUTION IS WRONG! AIDS IS CAUSED BY GOD! STOP SNORTING DEMON POWDER OFF THE GENITALS OF THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD.
---
Looks like a graph generated with an excel sheet to me.
---
meh
---
So what about cloaking and it’s counter
---
And speed tanking and it’s counter
---
You don’t like your end game gank ships being nerfed just as much as titan pilots want their end game defense or fleet ship getting nerfed
---
no way, ccp should remove the  interdiction nullified form T3Cs
---
Uh, if you can't find something fun to do in the San Diego area you're probably braindead. At worst you can go back up to LA, where there's as many options if not more than Vegas.
---
Sure and capitals should still be able to fit them too why not right? /s
---
Why skill injections are bad. Nice fight though.
---
We shall see.
---
Frankly, I have more faith in our FCs than you do.
---
You're right lets all get tickets to the next Chargers game!
---
You are so wrong on this. Decent write up. A tad self important but a quality read.
---
Dang it I was going to post this!
---
Here is her blog link. I don’t know if its already up there or not :p
---
https://ashyin.space/aar-biggest-fight-ive-ever-started/
---
So claoking doesn't realy have a counter except for maybe decloaking them with a fast ship when you know where they cloaked but an already cloaked enemy vOv. The counter to speed tank is actually webbing and being a rather good pilot.
---
But for 200 titans the only counter is 200+1 titan. So what is easier achievable?
---
Defending fraternity is an offensive deployment now?
---
As I said elsewhere: I don’t have a dog in this fight. It’s interesting to hear you say that he disappeared for 10 years when I have heard him mentioned, with great frequency, over those years. I’m in year 12, I suck at EVE but at least I -can- say ‘I was there’.
---
"A tad" 😊
---
We don't really drop capitals on cruiser gangs. We usually drop cruisers.
---
At least in the context of the OP.
---
As I said, it's not on the membership.
---
What  are  your proposed  changes  for  cloaks?
---
Contact EVE Scout.  They’ll get you out.
---
Just fyi, as far as I know: when navigating HS, you will notice "Jove Observatory" on the overview in some systems. Those systems contain wormholes to Drifter systems.
---
This partially solves the finding them again problem.
---
trusting company that messed up every other game they tried to create to fix their only one game that works only because it survived as they were not really focusing on it. roger i get it now :P
---
&gt; what you got?
---
a fucking tourist guide
---
My only question is what the fuck is a drekkavac?
---
You might want to invest in a co-processor.
---
It's written for entertainment on my own blog and was a hell of a lot of fun. That'll explain the style of writing
---
If you don't like Blackout or Cyno changes, you'll probably downvote me. Blackout is amazing, and cyno changes are a good idea but I think are too focused.
---
Sure, perhaps the 'awesome form' of hotdropping vanishes from the meta in your eyes. But, do you know what also disappears? Every single ratting ship fit with a cyno (which is probably close to 75%, especially myrms and domis), cyno noobships, cyno interceptors, and god forbid carriers/rorqs that cyno in more of the same to save themselves. In response to what OP said, I think cynos should not be allowed on any frigate whatsoever. Oh no, your SP farming cyno alt has to train a month or two to fly a recon now before you can make money on it again instead of using an Ibis. 
---
Cyno inhibs should work for the entire grid, not just 100km. Countering them is really easy; just warp to 100 from the tackled person and burn the rest of the way, or bm that spot, warp to something else, warp back at 100km. If you cyno in carriers or dreads, to my knowledge, that range really doesn't matter. They can still combat people. Realistically all it does is delay the cyno on the ship/fleet that is engaged in a brawl.
---
Now, that said, I do think it is a BIT too restricted. BLOPS as cyno ships is out of the question in my eyes. They are WAY too expensive for that purpose. Recons, I think are an excellent choice. They have the right amount of risk vs reward, and Recon is literally in the title, right? These are the guys that should be looking for people to shoot. These are the ones that can sneak around. It makes sense, guys. It really does. I think that it would be logical to have command destroyers and command ships also have the capability. It makes sense, it's in the name. If you notice the trend in my logic, it is because I'm merely going off of the name of the ship class. I suppose you could say BLOPS makes complete sense too, and I agree, but I just don't think it is viable.
---
A buddy and I were booshing Excavators off of rorquals and killing them, and TEST dropped a TITAN and a carrier on us. A frigate and a command destroyer. That's ridiculous. That is the sort of thing CCP is hoping to quell. Will the actual good fights become slightly more difficult to manage logistically? Not really. If anything, use your 'cyno interceptor' to burn in front of the fleet, then warp the recon to it. Congratulations, you now have one more step.
---
TLDR can't wait to see all the downvotes. Lol.
---
It really should be a permabannable offense IMO.

At least 2! They're small and cheap, I usually carry 3 sets just to be extra sure.
---
Not for nothin, AFK seem to be the only ones committing real hard to trying new comps in an attempt to not be locked into shaq meta. Big brass balls and will welp 30b+ to try something new
---
Hi Ashy &lt;3
---
found the retard
---
I better be seeing you at EVE London &lt;3
---
Yes. Two sets of Sisters, one set of combats is my go-to.
---
You will need to remind me when/where
---
Mine uses 5% cpu so not sure, what are your specs?
---
I’m watching
---
Number two and four are pandafam and Fraternity. Legacy is number 3. But, goons + Legacy can beat literally everyone else as we saw last summer, so now nobody is going to bother fighting Legacy if supercapitals are available and goons are there. 
---
You seem to be missing a lot of what Eve is. It’s not just a spaceship fighting game, and if you treat it like one you’ll be disappointed. Especially if you do this after joining the largest mega coalition in the game and then show up to all the “important” timers, 99% of which will be blueballs because your alliance wouldn’t take the fight in the first place if it didn’t have overwhelming superiority. 
---
Join some small FW group if you want lots of casual, low stakes pvp available on demand.
---
It's not just about finding something fun to do, it's about finding something fun to do for a ridiculous number of people.  
---
Which is significantly easier in a city like Las Vegas, dedicated to entertainment.  Not impossible in San Diego,  but you'll have significantly more options, especially on short notice. Which were the two points made.
---
LA is a terrible place
---
The history of EVE and a vast majority of its content has been shaped by self-important, narcissistic assholes.  The game would be boring without them.
---
Good bye!
---
Eve Vegas is awesome, but honestly I’m excited for new locations. I went to Eve Toronto and besides a really strange pick for the Saturday night party it was an incredible event! We’re Eve players, all we need is somewhere with bars and we’re good to go. I guess a conference setting during the day is good too!
---
Maybe I’m weird but the same thing over and over gets old, so it’d be cool to switch up the scenery and go see/party somewhere else.
---
I'll take 40,000 tons of human waste and used needles on the streets per year for 500 Alex.
---
Nice writeup! Thanks for creating fights!
---
I’ll buy it if you’d be willing to part with it.
---
Yeah this app is really awesome. I’ve always wanted to ability for a companion app for Eve where I can do anything on the app that I can do docked up in Eve!!
---
It's fairly easy to scout a gang and then interceptor cyno the perfect counter right on top of them too...
---
&gt; What a time it would be when committing capitals would actually mean something
---
How many big cap brawls have happened in the last 2 years? 
---
Do you ever wonder why, on a weekly basis, big blocs form full capital fleets but don't drop them?
---
The issue is that it costs more cpu than several clients.
---
Let's put cynos on a cloaky nullified ship. What could go wrong.
---
There was a space shooter mmo that uses 99% of GPU at all times on main menu, but 40% at most in-game. EVE launcher is bad, but it's not that bad :)
---
Cloaking is a counter to bloated alliances. For speed tanking.... There's a module called a stasis webifier, it can be fitted on your ship... If you fly a capital you should know what a stasis webifier is... Yikes...
---
&gt;He was the man behind the man who destroyed the Band of Brothers alliance ("The Mittani sends his regards")
---
no he wasn't? feel free to check the rest of this post for the people who actually did shit at the time (dj, rive, etc) talking specifically about it, pretty sure there's a few other comments on that issue by dj, but i can't be arsed to find it. Here's rive's comment tho: https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/42co46/im_darius_johnson_former_ceo_of_goonswarm_csm_1/cz9ckuq/
---
ps: note that dj's reddit acc was deleted, so if it looks like a direct response from him and there's no acc name([deleted]), its prob him
---
&gt;  he was the focal point of Goonswarm Federation back in that era before he got banned for a while after the Wizard Hat ...  talks a lot and alternates between occasional moments of brilliance and a lot of koolaid
---
what moments of brilliance? the original question wasn't in bad spirit, im really curious as to why people think he's that much of an important and smart guy, because all I see him doing is giving the go ahead to the people actually coming up with all the stuff(asher mostly nowadays i guess, and kendarr?. fuck if i know who manages the industry side of theirs, you get the point)
---
&gt; Mittani hasn't really personally generated EVE in-game content in almost a decade now .. The GSF in-game content at this point is more run by the other GSF leaders.
---
ok, but what content has he generated in-game a decade ago?
---
/u/TalkingBackAgain this migh as well be a reply to your comment as well, aint gonna duplicate it
---
Fit combat probes on your recon, land on top of the fleet. You even have covert ops cloaking capability.
---
&gt; egressive tax rate = Price goes up if you want to dodge the npc personal income taxes and create a 1 man corp and goes down if you want to get as big as Dreddit/Karmafleet and ofc capped at a certain limit. 
---
now you must be trolling :P
---
Navy Frigs are not terribly hard to get if you have a FW character. They are substantially cheaper on the FW LP stores than elsewhere. For example a comet is, what, 10k LP with Federal Defense Union, and something ridiculous like 80k elsewhere?
---
Depending on who is controlling the war zone navy frig prices at market are usually between 10-19 million isk.

Has an Atlantic City vibe to it.
---
People live regular, affluent lives on the mainland especially if you live in a first or second tier city. China is not only a manufacturing titan, but also lays claim to the robotics and hardware development capital of the world(Shenzhen) with foreigners from all across the globe doing business with the local Chinese businesses. They've got rap music, a massive film industry and just about everything you could ask for. People are wealthy on the mainland and own successful businesses that produce capital. As I've said before, the CCP took a backwater nation, invested in their infrastructure, schools, education and thrust their country into a superpower. Back in the eighties people were still pedaling around in Rickshaw's but almost everyone owns a car in China now, villages have turned into cities and so on. All this and still with an iron-fist.
---
I support the struggle of the Hong Kong people, I am arguing however that liberty and capitalism are not one in the same nor that they must exist together to succeed. I think you confuse, "capitalism" with classical liberalism.   
---
Capitalism has also flourished under monarchist regimes—in fact the birthplace of capitalism was at the center of the British Empire and is exactly what made it so formidable and power-hungry. Empires the world-over scrambled to establish control over land and resources to power their industries.
---
But the boss might find some other venture (= game) since there's a pretty significant difference between ISK/hr in nullsec pre-black out and high sec when it comes to botting meaning they cant extract as much real life money out of it.
---
came here to post this
---
I tried to install it and it says my phone is not compatible. It's a 2019 mid range phone, and it's not supported. Is it still in beta?
---
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
---
the irony when all that's left on r/eve is you and mar5hy alts and a few bombers bar dudes and the V0LTA vote brigade
---
you are using zkill pricing and neglecting the titan pilot itsself along w/ fittings
---
Considering that joining goons is the polar opposite of what iron always claimed to be....
---
Either delete or become the small independent alliance you always dreamed of.
---
Joining goons is weak. :)
---
Nah, not a fan of wormholes. Every good wormhole fleet is built around destroying faxes too. It would be some awesome footage though.
---
They tend to be left to last in the high class brawls (basically EVE jousting) because if you kill them first the enemy fleet bail. 
---
here's a cool fairly recent vid that includes triage POV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TsKXC8UcK0
---
I think I got this site, from eve scout right ?
---
these are month per month data, not day per day, so in 2017-2019 you can clearly see last monts. These charts showing overal trend in past months. (yes after blackout youcan still see drop).  
---
In next updates i will do some time better timeline including important changes.
---
You’re missing the point. I didn’t say he did everything in EVE, because you can’t do that.
---
The point is: by being on the mind of so many people for so long, he’s one of the big names in EVE, for better or for worse. I have seen hundreds if not thousands of posts referencing him. Whether he did it or not, whether he was there or not, he was in people’s head.
---
I’m stressing again: I have no dog in this fight. I’m just observing. I’m not shit posting, I’m not trying to win an argument. I’m just saying that he’s been talked about a lot. If you’re saying he hasn’t contributed in 10 years I’m going to be even more impressed because he’s then been talked about for so long, very much more than what his contributions would account for. That in itself is a talent.
---
I do know, from listening to some of his conversations, that the least you can say about him isi that he’s not an idiot. This is a smart man in a game for smart people [whether you like him or not does not really matter]. That aspect of him I do appreciate. It doesn’t mean I agree with everything he says or does, I hope to be smart enough to put it in the right context.
---
google sheet to be precise. Data were collected through some c# coding :)
---
1 datapoint = 1 month here
---
I miss RnK
---
Other than 'a large oragnised group of players represents a large portion of the MER' what exact trend did you notice.
---
It sounds like you are projecting other people's opinions and analysis onto your own.
---
So streamers are a problem too then I guess?
---
Uh, just close it once you have your clients open. It makes relogging slightly slower but if you never log out you'll never need to log back in ;)
---
Your entire post is predicated on the assumption that 'less options = less good'.
---
Are people this fucking bad at logic?
---
How do I change skills in the app?  I've been clicking on every skill in the queue, but I can't change them.

24% is used to render CCP Falcon's face.
---
Can you show ship_destroyed/online players?
---
You Canadian?
---
where did he mention blackout at all? not everything is about it jesus
---
*a ha haaaaa*
---
Was it the inferno changes with the new war dec system, or the retribution changes with the new crimewatch system that spiked activity in HS/LS?  
---
Or was it the improved NPC AI?
---
We’re into September now, guess we’ll see if it ticks back up or stabilizes over the next couple months.
---
Is moving Eve Vegas to San Diego a bad call? Yes.
---
Is San Diego a bad place: No.
---
Go apply to be an FC in Specter Fleet or Bombers Bar public channels. You don't need to join a particular corporation or alliance to do this and in Spectre Fleet you'll get a junior qualification that first allows for certain types of fleets before full FC tags which allow for whatever. You'll get fleet numbers almost every time and generally the better you do the more people will be excited to come fly with you. 
---
As far as learning, there is no better way than doing. Just start with easy stuff and get fleet movement commands down and basic target calling then after that you add in more complex stuff.
---
Next EVE meetup will be in Yakutsk because chaos
---
Also can you load like 40 probes into the probe launcher now? I figured that out after returning from a long break and its made things much easier!
---
I thought it was very entertaining. Good fight, good write!
---
We know you only drop when it's a one sided win.
---
His total losses on ZKill are 970bn. For the number given to be correct, we need to find another 9 Trillion.
---
Sorry do I need to go make the other thread of "what playstyles have come into existence because of recent gameplay changes?" thread for you to be happy?
---
You mean HK and pets right?
---
Agree to disagree, we got some solid FC's.
---
Once aagain, ever wonder why thats the case?
---
Yeah I don't see San Diego as a place to never visit.  I don't see it as a place to have a horde descend, party, get into rated R shenanigans.  From a cost and logistical stand point its just a non starter.
---
Because the majority of people who play this game are risk-averse and just like accumulating assets like cookie-clicker in space
---
About MER specifically was the amount of wealth being generated by an ever shrinking player base, i just don't see how that can be sustainable for the economy, plus the isk generation, it has been off the damn chart, yet the sinks haven't keeping up with that.
---
Also a simple look the size of super capital fleet of the big empires should be another cause of concern for the game, though that one to be fair, i have always advocated to be a solvable problem, all ccp needs to do is hit those ships with a giant fucking hammer and the problem will solve itself, but that won't solve the economic issue of course, but it will at least improve the optics of the game.
---
Runs at &lt;1% when not focused, with client running. If I hover over it or click things, it goes up to between 3 and 10%.
---
Yep wait and see approach
---
So that would be a no then.
---
Insider tidbit for you foxy boys. We used you as bait... Goons had active hunters and some of us suspected that "random wormholers (btw)" could be used to  bait the safe logged dreads they have been sneaking into our space. While the initial drop was about 50/50 clueless space nerds/masterbaiters (not to be confused with masterbotters in deklein) i am most pleased goons decided to take the bait and especially so that they did so with such gusto. Delicious. 
---
O7 foxy see you next time. 
---
P.s i sadly missed out on teaching you the ways of the scorch (Praise be) come back soon
---
We just created a corp today maybe you wanna join us?
---
Man, you need to reread your own question.  
---
I think about it a fair bit, and having seen what bloc line members feel about non-helldunk meaningful  
---
 pvp, the above is the conclusion I have arrived at.

Blood and Fayral sit down with Fredrick VonHole and Dankguy to talk about Small Gang Capital game play. Dankguy focuses on hunting targets of opportunity while VonHole is known for hunting hunters.

Aside from what others have said - you have the right mentality. If you welp often people will stop wanting to fly under you, even with SRP.
---
As others have said Thera is probably your bet. Living in NPC null can be a pain logistically unless you have the isk to pay for a JF service. Stain is unironically not bad since you have some fairly decent regions nearby (esoteria/catch/impass/delve/tenerifis/immensea are all within about 20j)). Sakht is great is you just wanna roam Delve. I haven't set up a Kalevala staging yet but there's plenty of candidate systems in the neighboring high/lowsec regions. NPC dronelands when ccpls
---
Please just spit out your thesis.
---
Gate 30 caps outside of your umbrella and maybe we’ll drop in you :)
---
&gt;I think about it a fair bit
---
Obviously you don't, line members never make the decision to drop the fleet or not.
---
As a new player, does the learning curve ever let up? I'm 50/50 sold, but I'm not sure I can commit to it and if I should cut my losses. 
---
Most of my time has been spent docked reading about things like how to bookmark, how to find my wreck, or how to scan. Will I eventually just be able to play for a solid block of time?
---
Tap, hold, drag
---
It has a *crick* in its neck!
---
Why would that cause a *drop*? I believe the spike immediately after across all areas of space in the result of alpha clones, but I'm not sure what would've caused the huge drop right before that.
---
I returned after over a year off, and my Corp is now in a place where I can't use most of the higher-tier skills I trained. And I have to train these new Trig skills. Just feels like typical Eve after a break. At least the "Season of Skills" helped me train some new skills that didn't exist before.
---
I'm also a lot richer, as tons of stuff I bought is now way more expensive. Then about 2 weeks ago it all started dropping in price, after I sold it =P
---
I have never used extractors or injectors, and don't plan to. Debating resubbing other accounts I had.
---
Takes a while to find your legs again in this game, after a long hiatus.
---
Idk why you're shifting the conversation, this isn't about why the USSR failed or thrived, this is about authoritarian governments existing under capitalism. Which they do, as I said before, in different degrees of success.
---
I can't get over the weird metal fin on the bottom.
---
We'll certainly try!
---
Post WWB, pre Test and C02 moving South.
---
I think youre dumb. . .
---
It was not there 2 days ago I believe. A friend notified me that he found it yesterday. That's why I shared it here 😊
---
Cool shit. Small groups causing trouble  is the best.     
---
And I'm always surprised when I ask someone who isn't a newbro to do a remote rep cap chain with me and they have no idea what that is.
---
because N+1 means win so why would you feed instead of them feeding? Also in the wealthest age in the game people seem more fucking risk adverse gotta stack assets. Gotta get that 14th rorqual + alt intead of fund pvp
---
When I lived in fountain I used to farm them. We had a non invasion pact so no structure bashing IIRC, but I had fun shooting them before moving to south delve.
---
I'm in the process of liquidating and moving out myself, tired of the forced F1 fleets that are not fun and being blue to half of eve.
---
Yeah I learned 2 important lessons the first time I had to self destruct in a hole.   
---
Always book mark your exit wh. And keep backup scanner probes.
---
Everyone dose :(
---
So give us your wisdom.
---
You should already know capri, if you lose it you're fucked, there's a reason when two cap fleets go at it as soon as one fleet starts losing a few supers/titans they nope out, it takes time to replace and in that time your enemy gets to run roughshod over everything with impunity.
---
You better be pretty damn sure you're coming out the victor before you drop, which is why on a regular basis full fleets are formed by both sides but not dropped and we see 1-2 super fights a year decided by the first few titans to die.
---
I know they have a launcher with increased capacity. Idk how much
---
Upvote for the amount for times you mentioned fried chicken
---
thats the expanded probe launcher iirc.
---
ya ok I was worried you were going a different direction with that.
---
Well we elected Dunk Dinkle, so at least be sure he's gonna keep pestering CCP to introduce T2 salvage drones.
---
I was trying to get them to think about it for themselves. :(
---
I mean I was there for that fight on the Novac side. It was our fault for only bringing 1 HIC who didn't put his bubble up for the first half of the fight. You can't just not bring HIC bubbles so you can min max you fleet comp for dps and ewar, then complain about reshipping. You have to sacrifice 2-3 toons to make that not happen. It's on you.
---
Kestrel
---
Is this blackout content?
---
Now all he needs is the Microsoft installation DVD guide and the trilogy will be complete.
---
Either a WH with a NS static, or Thera, depending on how much you are willing to invest. 
---
Solo staging from a wh is going to take more logistics, and you can't have your clone there, but you are more likely to be left alone in your staging (wh space is pretty empty). 
---
Thera will be much easier on logistics, but you're more likely to become someone else's content at your own doorstep.
---
I thought the service got offlined, and any active jobs got stuck, when it went into final timer? - I'm not much of a builder tho, so may be extremely wrong about that.
---
In any case, tho. For 99% of the assets in null-sec, it's not really an issue. You can JF anything out of the thing if it looks like it might actually die, right up until the moment it actually does die. That's the major difference between null and j-space when it comes to this. In j-space you have limited options for evacuating assets. That's far easier in null.
---
Plus. If asset safety were removed, people would simply pick a keepstar or fortizar to stage out of, and stop stashing anything worth anything in medium citadels. Killing Astrahuses and Raitarus would rarely drop anything worth while.
---
I think you're confusing "hunters" with "actual players". The distinction between "huntard" and "normal player" is one of risk and challenge aversion, not an interest in pvp or the size of their respective fleets.
---
Pretty much everyone in EVE, except perhaps the krabbiest of krabs, wants to pvp to some degree, and small gang seems to be the most popular among actual pvpers.
---
The kids who call themselves "hunters" are typically those who roam around in cloaky or disposable bullshit, avoiding anything remotely resembling an actual fight, and either gank newbros/miners with their T3Cs or drop blobs on anything that could actually present a threat to aforementioned T3C.
---
EVE has little enough content to go around these days. Free/easy kills from krabs have been sustaining the playerbase for a long time, keeping people happy between actual fights, but krabs are becoming an endangered species now. At this point, people who consume content without contributing any in return are a cancer that is kicking EVE while it's already down.

...and yet, we have these stupid kids roaming around avoiding fights and farming the few krabs we have left, because they want killmails and are either too selfish or too stupid to understand the damage their so-called "hunting" is doing to an already struggling game. If you are one of these kids, either man the F up and start looking for *fights* instead of standing in welfare line to collect your free killmails, or give up your delusions of being a pvper and go play Hello Kitty Online.
---
In case it wasn't clear, I am by no means saying that krabs should not be killed - if you happen upon a krab doing something stupid, enjoy your free killmail. The problem is people whose idea of "pvp" is doing nothing but looking for such opportunities for free killmails; this only serves to drive krabs away from the game and make those who stay even more risk averse.
---
Ancil repper is fine even on buffer fits, at least on smaller ships.
---
Ah ok that makes sense
---
To be clearer. What's been happening from the beginning is that both panfam and goons have been batphoned for every major timer. The more recent development is that panfam deployed to Detorid and TEST has been asking around if anyone from the imperium wants to deploy nearby.

No idea but, I'd give him a hand.  :-)

"Digging numbers out of our buttholes" is not "data analytics", buddy.

always happy to be used as bait (if that's what that was), next time, can one of you die so my KB gets more than the sabre I bombed while it was trying to loot shit? (preferably lose a nyx next time I bomb it)
---
Nice try CIA
---
&lt;insert&gt; would like to know Your location.
---
They get stuck, but you can still cancel the job, not sure how much is lost in terms of materials and blueprints.
---
I cannot count the number of probes I lost back when I first started exploring. My internet was shitty and any time someone decided to stream something I'd drop. I log back in, my probes are gone and my sigs aren't scanned. 
---
Still, now I always carry 4 sets of probes and bookmark every single wormhole.
---
Yeah, that's the protruding engine I mentioned. That thing looks so off center, it feels like the ship will start doing donuts when you turn it off
---
soct constellation in geminate where goons also have freeports

i think curse is somewhat underrated
---
You'll never ring it of em man, blue team good red team bad.
---
I remember when we got dropped on by 3 carriers, a few supers, a tackle rorq, and a titan because we caught a carrier that left his fighters out while on a fortizar. 
---
You guys couldn’t kill any of us then.
---
Your titan then warped to a gate, and we caught him again. You then dropped more supers XD
---
No one died still.
---
Were we bait then?

Botting is a problem in all MMOs. Especially when the gameplay can be as monotonous as EVE.
---
It is not about what FC can/cannot do, but how ingame mechanics work and how people behave.          
---
**Any** type of traps require for people to be logged out most of the time.       
---
If you tell 100 people to login, trust me at least 20% of them will be logging in much slower than others.
---
I gotta hand it to him, he really loosened the grip from the game.
---
Coreli corporation make boosters so do
---
Es and Wizz are or used to at least.
---
There are probably more but those are the 2 which come to mind.
---
Great stuff!
---
He is playing the game just quietly now.         
---
CCP bans him when they confirm that it is he.
---
Mittens looks like someone that would use "despite making up just 13% of the population..." in an argument lol
---
I thought there was a button that reconnects you to lost probes? Or is that unreliable?
---
It does sound like you have an old processor though... What have you got? I'm betting on at least a 5th gen i5/7
---
I'm glad! Tanking the supers with our Dreks was super fun and we all had a great evening. Made a change from the usual instant 14 Nyxes to shut down any opposition. :D
---
I've been ootl, where did we plant a keep in detorid?
---
If you’re the kind of person who’d ask this question, you’re the kind of person that’ll like eve.  
---
Yes, a large number of rest apis.  This kind of gameplay is serious in eve.  There have been several influential players that just deal with market based stuff.
---
Don't put words in my mouth. Nowhere did I say that line-members make that decision. But even if they did, I don't think they would take the uncertain fight.
---
[carries 10 sets of probes]
---
Being paranoid has it's advantages.
---
There used to be, but CCP made them legal and removed that aspect of the game

I remember having to do it with implants. 💀

Leave sniper alone!

Majority of the AAR aside, cute to hear that you're still chilling with Tedward on occasion. De'Aren says hi.
---
If you want to stay in losec, and learn the ropes about Fc-ing, contact EVE University. They have a FC training program that offers tips and guidelines, and have regular fleets of cheap frigates they send out at least weekly in the Placid region. You will learn and at the same time, teach new players and scouts. No pressure to perform, a learning-friendly environment and a lot of tips/learning resources in the forums. After that you can see if you like it and move to another corp if you wanna upscale.

my wife's son really liked this post! updoots for you good sir!
---
lol we actually reference the MER and player count graphs when making arguments, those are hard numbers generated and released by CCP, also known as facts. The other side just keeps saying how they feel about the changes and how they think the player base feels about the changes, 100% anecdotal, 100% subjective, 0% fact.
---

We hear you. Everyone of this corp was once sitting in your very position. I love not having blues

---
I would throw in baiting as a cloak counter, but there is some issue of it trying to force an error on your opponent's side rather than some action you take to deal with setup X.
---
Great interview, especially when they're going over tactics.
---
Dirty tricks, MI6
---
And right now you don't know if someone is even there so baiting is more 50% of a counter maybe.
---
Cant find the V key
---
Everyone knows you carry 16 (or even 24, why not) core probe I in your ship for emergencies, then 8-16 sister probes for your regular scanning.
---
Trader here, if you want you can PM me and I could explain you the basics and link some resources, programs (mainly Evernus) around trading in EVE. 
---
Also if you have a real-life trading experience I could really make a use of your skills now as I am more of a programmer (Python) and wannabe trader (cryptocurrency markets).

The war with the same enemy we've been fighting for 3 years because it's the only one Dran didn't blue? Who is now 20x our size with a superfleet to match? Sadly it has done quite the opposite for us. We are good at fighting groups with greater numbers but poor coordination and/or a smaller/similarly sized capital fleet to us. Sadly Fraternity is no longer in this category so we are now just another face in the blob, unable to do anything without big daddy Test
---
trending down or just outright flat lining, the HS+LS line shows just the tiniest beginning of an increase that just stops cold and flattens out right around the June/July releases, abyssals look pretty dead starting at the same time, everything else shows a decent drop, kinda makes you wonder where Hilmar and Falcon are getting this whole" There's more stuff fighting and dying than ever" story line they are trying to push. And its the time of the year where we normally see people start to return to game, the summer is mostly over or winding down depending on where you live, the game's median age is way past the point where population dips can be blamed on "going back to school" usually the blocs would be bulking back up on their player counts and getting ready to a pick a fall war with someone.

Is there a web equivalent to Evemon? Or something that runs on Linux. GTKEvemon is dead, and I'm quickly getting tired of running a Windows VM just for that.
---
None that I can find. It was an educated guess made by my partner based on her understanding of the game, server counts, etc. If it's true I assume we'll probably hear something official about it at some point in the future, but blizzard is a lot more secretive about this type of thing than CCP is.

Agreed! LOL :-D

You can also configure it to pulse the F1, just increases you get confused.

I was selling some items in jita today, and someone from No Handlebars. alliance tried to buy something from me, I kindly told them they are a scammer and they are not allowed to purchase items from me, they sounded truly outraged they were lumped in with the scammers.

After I pointed them to this post, and told them to look at what their “friends” were posting, they left the convo after expressing their shame for the corp and alliance.
---
Tisk tisk No Handlebars, your own guys are disgusted with your conduct, and I understand from your aggressive behaviors posted in this thread, why they are scared to say something.

Thanks, have a great day!

Dear Dori Long,

Thank you for your reply, and you're welcome!
---
As a founding member of the congregation and the proud creator of no handlebars alliance (including ignoring everyone’s opinions and uploading an alliance logo that includes handlebars…) I am appalled.
---
I knew from the very moment that no handlebars lost the alliance tournament that their moral compass would swivel round to due south. I simply cannot hide my disgust at this horrific turn of events. 
---
I have also entered the offices of our legal department and moved information pertaining to this even back to the top of the "in" tray, as well as stamped the envelope with the "super duper important" stamp, the one with the brightest red ink. But I fear this will do no good as Morvin is in fact the head of the legal department and is kept on retainer for tax purposes. I do know a man in Washington who promises to get a deal sorted out. A great deal. The best deal you have ever seen. Because he says he knows more about deals than anyone. But he is dealing with a bout of wind at the moment and may be delayed (he does have the best people working on his wind though, he assures me).
---
I am setting up an alliance “go fund me” with the help of the more God fearing members of the alliance to assist you in the procurement of counselling services to help you work your way through this. We need to address your upcoming trust issues and ensure that you can once again love… And be loved.
---
I pray for your recovery, and that you once again touch tips with Jesus Christ.

Blessed be. Blessed be.

Edited my post, definitely the ice belt, thanks you.

Considering ECM is the only counter to trig DPS im suprised we dont see ECM everywhere currently.   
---
The Triglavian ships mainly Destroyer up just outclass the empire counterparts in almost everyway thanks to powercreep, poor balancing and a terrible decision on how to implement their weapon system.   
---
Baffles me how they thought they would be even remotely balanced :P
---
Looking at the tracking #'s, your down like 15 people but up 16 total from the last chart DV so nicely provided. So not too bad.
---
You can still make amends and send me that 5bil you owe me.

these guys still havent righted their wrong. be wary!

its just shity bomber fleets everywhere.

bomber
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
better remove bomber from game
---
Oh it was? Ye thought I saw ice there but assumed I saw it wrong. Too tired:p 
---
Gf btw, was fun.
---
If that's what surprised you about people who play *EVE* being obsessive, I have something to tell you.
---
BRAAAAAAAIIIIINNNZZZ
---
You have my downvote
---
I would love to see more salvaging stuff in general in the game. More ways to salvage, salvage materials being more useful and in many more blueprints, more and different types of salvage.
---
My reasoning is very simple and straight forward. Salvaging as a method to gather resources in the game is much more active gameplay then mining, PI, etc. Therefore a lot less people would get turned off from it then they do from these.
---
&gt;flys a capital
---
&gt;whats a remote rep

Maybe you should try flying something good at killing bombers then? That seems like a good time to me.

Ya dude cause 30 battleships and 2 dreads def fits through those holes. Props to them though hopefully they still stick around.

We don't seed holes with alts like other corps, but there should hopefully be rescue caches left by our scouts in those systems (we have 72.5% of holes covered at time of writing). If OP had reached out to us we'd have probably got him out quicker than his support ticket.

Expanded Probe Launcher holds 80 Core probes. (To separate regular from Expanded launchers, they made Combat Probes 10x the size of Core Probes, then limited the regular launcher to only hold 8 Cores. However this has the odd side-effect of making the Expanded launcher a bit huge.)

Cloaking doesn't affect you - when the ship's attacking you it's decloaked and normal combat applies.
---
Speed tanking can be countered by web/grapple, scram, neut and piloting to manage transversal.
---
Oh...I am pretty sure most people know how this will go and I am pretty sure CCP is indifferent to the player concerns regarding this.

They think it’s a great plan, so there you go.  No need for all this time consuming discussion and deliberation BS.

What events/battles/wars do you wanna see on these?  
---
I have main Expansions + some main battles + jita burns, what more guys?
---
i like how the other comment that says the same thing has 12 upvotes
---
A more terse answer: No. In Eve, even the largest ships are completely controlled by a single player, including any smaller craft the big ones launch. Maybe someday. There are people who'd like to see it.
---
There’s them delicious tears I mentioned.
---
Hold up, what?! I thought the expanded probe launcher was just to use combat probes? Since when does it hold more probes?
---
Thst battle rep looks like the age of supers to me.
---
I think for a large segment of the CCP Convention goers it really doesn't matter where they host it. They show up and go listen to Devs talk instead of reading a Dev Blog for a change. Then they go meet whichever friends they may have made in-game at whatever bar is closest to the event. Rinse and repeat for 2 days. Maybe attend whatever drinking event CCP hosts to show other Eve players you have a group to hang out with and aren't a total basement dweller while drinking on CCPs tab for a short time. Perhaps show up to whatever awful activity they plan as well like those mentioned above so you can say you were there and laugh at yet another CCP mishap.
---
I'd say that covers a fair percentage of most attendees. There's still others that would certainly take advantage of the location change in earnest by seeing whatever unique landmarks and such may be around that particular town. However, the few times my normal Vegas trip happened to coincide with Eve Vegas the majority of people seemed largely rooted to the same areas I always saw them in as I went about my normal Vegas activities. I wouldn't say Vegas necessarily even served the broad community well since my experience was only a small fraction of attendees there actually did any gambling or traditional Vegas events from what I had seen. Convention, Bar and maybe a Room party seemed to highlight the average plans most players would respond with when asked about their weekend plans.
---
You’re so right.
---
Also what is the meaning of the name “WE FORM V0LTA”?
---
Depends what kind of null you want. If you're looking for sov null it wouldn't be the place for you, but Orvolle is a highsec system with a decent market right next to Syndicate NPC null and lowsec systems and is a great staging location. 
---
There are some cheeky folk out in Syndicate though. I wouldn't suggest scanning down and warping to MTUs in the area.
---
BuT cApS aRe OvErPoWeReD gUyS
---
this is incorrect.  Booster production is alive and well.  The only aspect that has changed is method of distribution.  With the legalization of boosters it has opened up traditional markets.  The drug running and more personalized sales model largely died with the changes.
---
OP: If you're interested check out Coreli Corporation, Lethal Injection, or Hedonistic Imperative (Es and Whizz).

---
Idk why they had the warp strength to begin with. They have fast align time it's just adding a layer of brainless safety to an already safe ship.
---
They are removing the venture as a ship that can do fleet warfare nodes. I know of nothing else.
---
All indy and miner ships should have warp core bonus's to dis-incentivize solo kills. Also prospect doesn't need covert cyno unless we are getting proper covert mining vessels.
---
Change my mind
---
It can go and stay go
---
Part of me wants to be bitter and point out this has been a thing forever, another part of me wants to put out there's other models you can get an even harder kick off (try an apostle for most gallente stations), but it's fun watching people see this stuff for the first time.
---
There's a couple stations around the game ([this one especially](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Arton_II_-_CreoDron_Factory)) where folks will camp it by sitting ready to undock a moros that will instantly bump to stop people from warping then kill them because they can't dock.
---
INSANE!!!!
---
You can still bait the occasional stupid mission runner by shooting their MTU. It is amusing and works.
---
Damm that was good. Nice action, nice handling, and nice music.
---
I’ll bite. Why should solo kills be dis-incentivized?
---
In Osmon the ones I've seen about aren't bots, just often afk with an MTU out.
---
fucking galaxy brain over here
---
didn't apply  to KarmaFleet, doesn't count.
---
i always said that minmatar ships are just stolen amarr concepts before the classical beautiful amarrian armor plates are put on them :P
---
You are getting a massive stipend on top of resource bonus so of course there has to be sinks. But like I said debatable and I am just a player looking in. Interesting that the community no longer buys into their shit of Eve being not solo friendly (lol) and best to band together with actual people and not create more alts. 
---
If I am trolling then this community is at a whole another level of delusional. Literally the same stuff bickered 10 years ago in regards to the game dying, how to fix it, is still discussed again. Only difference is Goons/Test is the big bad entity and not the Northern Coalition and we aren't on the forums.
---
I would think that all these points is why I think the community is delusional.
---
Buying into the idea of having excessive grind on top of loss real is going to attract new people.  
---
Bickering on this subreddit the same shit that people were complaining about with the Northern Coalition. The proliferation of caps, super caps, more coalitions. 
---
Ignoring that something is seriously wrong if the Dev's are doing some extreme stuff to drive artificial conflict. On top of withholding player numbers. (Definitely biased opinion and holds little weight.)
---
I appreciate the reply, as that is always better then being ignored. Not really trolling as I honestly see these subreddits of how to fix Eve as trolling. Literally the same shit, but with more vitriol and a circle jerk of who's soup we can stick our dick in now. Looks like recently it was null sec players who is eating their dick soup, next on the list is worm hole players.
---
Hopefully the game will last long enough for me to get back into null sec for a bit before the real black out.
---
C12H16N2 is that you? 😆
---
Real wormholers remap it to spacebar. 
---
It serves a dual purpose, as it also stops you from typing in local like a scrub.

Ok so anothet graph that confirm the useless of blackput to have more pvp in NS : there is no more frag.

I strongly urge you to become one!

There's some really interesting fits you can do with a legion. For example a 300k ehp buffer tank. That one's not cloaky though. If you want cloaky you can do around 150k, but has to be rlml not hams.

This right here. Some folk do use tengus but it's way less common than Lokis. Can get some mean dps though.

Nice video, solid music and decent fights.
---
I think it does show that the Nergal is kinda weak though. 24 minute video &gt; number of times you ramped to full = 0. You could have literally transplanted this entire fit on a Vengeance and every fight would have ended the same way, except the Vengeance doesn't cost 200+mil for the hull + gun. Now obviously the Vengeance has less dps and range and all that, but none of that was really a deciding factor in any of those fights.
---
Also, those Comets must have been newbros. You can see them orbiting at max speed and out-tracking themselves. 5 proper fit comets would have put out 1,500dps perfectly applied which definitely would have instagibbed that Nergal.
---
Entertaining video nonetheless and props for taking out a turbo blinged frigate out. Big balls.
---
Pahahahahahhahaahahahhaahhahahahahahahaahahhahaahhaahahahhahahhahahaahahahahahahhaahahhaha *breaths deeply* pahahahahhahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahhanahahahahahahhahahahahahhhahahaahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Over a year still fucking hilarious!!!!!!!
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
to be fair, when MTU and salvage drones are working. not much to do but afk xD
---
We need more "because fuck you" campaigns
---
[citation needed]
---
Dont need to, you wont change CCPs mind ;)
---
Girlfriends/wives are terrible for gaming/hobbies/fun in general.
---
I see no problem with lots of small ships killing few big ships.
---
i agree actually . the nergal dps is anemic and way overpriced to make it shine like that . vengeance tanks more and is cheaper. but nergal attracts alot of fights cause everybody knows its  a pinata
---
good stuff. that last fight was bonkers.
---
Like on a 20 man Drake gang lol
---
Which is when it amuses me to swoop in and pop the MTU then sit there staring waiting for them to lock me up.
---
This is posed in the Corp &amp; Alliance Discussion, as a warning to any corp that is looking to join a alliance, or any alliances looking for trust worthy allies. It is open to discussion.
---
Prospective Members might see this thread and skip over this scammer alliance, for a trustworthy and professional alliance.
---
An alliance that actually values integrity.
---
Right now, No Handlebars. HAS ZERO PULL or any type of intimidation factor on me or my alliance/corp. They do not know my main, and can not retaliate against me for calling them out for what they are, and that upsets them.
---
Almost every post is proof of that.
---
Pahahahhahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahhahahahahaha 
---
Much funny, such wow please dont stop
---
I felt i gave them ample time to resolve this issue.
---
If you check the dates on the mails, i gave them a month. That is more than fair. And i certainly didnt RUN to the forums the second it happened.
---
The points covered in those mails and on this forum post by me, are rock solid and not disputable. that is why everyone, including yourself have nothing to go on, but to attack my character.
---
And if you cant tell from the eve-mails, its all one big joke to them.
---
This is Eve. Scamming is perfectly legal. but when your a scammer there is a chance you are going to get called out publicly for it. Thats where we are today.
---
I am sure Morvinn didnt think it would go this far.
---
I cant breath dude 
---
This is the funniest thing I've read in years.
---
Please never stop!!!
---
Phahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaah
---
good for every meat in alliances
---
If the CEO, the Diplomats, and All Members, sit and watch and do nothing.
---
they not only endorse, but encourage that style of play.
---
Any “proud” person, would kick them from their corp/alliance. If they let them stay, than they support it.
---
You fly under their flag, you follow their code. If their code allows scamming. They are scammers, weither or not every member engages in it or not.
---
The point of this thread is to warn anyone who might deal with the No Handlebars. Alliance.
---
get in shape and you can come to the beach
---
That's what you get when you make battleships utterly obsolete as fleet units.
---
I thought you'd disagree TBH. Every time I say the Nergal is kinda bad everyone spergs out "800 DPS FRIGATE ASDJSIDASBID". It's sad that its main selling point is "Everyone wants to shoot it". Kiki is just so much better.
---
Yea the ending blew my mind, GG, Well played and F\*&amp;% the guy in the griffin.
---
I think that CCP wanted big ass capital ship brawls because it got them publicity in the gaming industry.  Mittens and the Imperium saw this early on with the addition of the excavators and set loose all the autistic, number crunching nerd pilots to built a large cache of capitals.  "Two titans for every pilot." I think Mittens stated that on one of his streams in 2016.  I think I am wrong on the year.
---
Now we got blackout crap, the drifter crap, and the crap cyno changes....  The EvE Online is dead meme is starting to take shape here.
---
If CCP Hilmar reads this, please add an "What would an Min/maxing, autistic, number crunching nerd pilot with at least 12 omega accounts do?" to your thought process on making changes to this game.  It sounds like he just plays one account at a time unlike some of the pilots out there.
---
Tbh, I'm a but far from understanding modern platforms to make a call. Though, I believe that technology is not crucial: with ANY you can implement a sluggish crap. Ans even though, technology is important, what's even more important is the proper design.
---
It will only work if the keyboard has a voice recognition and highlights F1 only when FC say "fire".
---
I  have also had shady dealings with No Handlebars, especially Morvinn he's the worst with his big old wig wobbling around. He's like a brunette version of jhonny bravo just without the chin. 2.5/10 game content rating for No.Handle im afraid.
---
I'm sure someone was up to some shenanigans with new players. This is why we can't have nice things.
---
I question the over use of boosters versus more resistances. Can't log in or pyfa to test what the resistances of the loggerhead would be with this fit.
---
is this some kind of in-joke copypasta?
---
remove assest safety in kills will rise
---
Would do afain 10/10. My guys loved that fight.
---
No this dude genuinely believes that 1 No Handlebars is still an operating alliance and 2 that his opinions matters to us or anyone xD
---
I like it, looks tastefully retro. Better than anything razer has ever made.
---
You can put normal probes in it too.
---
"Unidentified Wormhole" is the beacon for entrances to the Drifter wormholes.
---
You gone done it now!:)
---
I think a lot of people are interested in seeing the effects of the blackout. Dunno the best approach to it but a 3 month period, june-august excluding wars which mainly has been 2, the northern one (june) which I belive period basis was the center of and the southern one which is detorid (june-august) and scalding pass and wicked creek (july-august). It will still be skewered due to summer being a generally lower period so a comparison is needed from last years june-august to see the relative decline excluding wars so it can be subtracted from this years relative decline. Both destruction and ship kills.
---
I ofc know its a lot of work so just a suggestion since you asked. And I totally get it if you feel it will get too political and choose not to. Or any other reason for that matter.
---
Its nice work btw.
---
He’s in 11 hour ques for wow classic
---
thankfully i havent done that.
---
but i have learne that you don't do suicide ECM to save people who do.....they deserve to die &lt;.&lt;  ffs i did ECM on the person scramming them, and they didnt think to warp off
---
I have the those decals too! Just never got around to putting them on my car.
---
I agree with this sentiment, but there's also extra parameter involved - effort. I do not know why Pyfa has been coded to commit to DB on every action, I suppose it was because ORM used - sqlalchemy - doesn't play well with threads, and there're few threads involved (like price fetcher). Maybe it could be worked around initially one way or another, but now it's at the very least very hard to do.
---
Can you work around by overhauling whole app design now? Yes you can, if dependencies like SQLAlchemy allow it. If they do not allow, can you write some Pyfa-specific ORM to have everything we need to make it faster? Sure you can.
---
Will I do it? Never. I can change architecture if I will rewrite Pyfa from scratch if performance can be improved at not very significant cost effort-wise, but I will not waste any time writing ORM to interface with database in a convenient manner.
---
not to mention Vegas is a lot cheaper both for the players to stay at and for CCP to host it.
---
God forbid a solo player have fun for once.
---
He basically upgraded our doctrine fit with pith a types.  Its pretty much how we want all of our rorqs fit, so they tank like bosses.
---
If the goal the of super/titan changes as well as the Rorqual changes was to allow more super capital fights with the intent of getting more publicity for eve online, i'd say they absolutely failed in their objective.
---
This can be shown by the lackluster coverage of the 3 biggest titan brawls eve online had since b-r (the titan brawls during the war last year) in comparison with even minor events in eve history that got a ton of coverage in the news.
---
Its possible that one of the reasons for this is that the titan brawls were so huge that none of the people that would normally be able to create good videos showcasing those battles were able to record any decent footage from it, due to constant client crashes as well as having to essentially play in potato mode where all you see are static images that get updated every few minutes.
---
But also i think another reason why it didn't generated the usual amount of buzz, is because people got tired of the news, especially considering that the titan and super numbers this days are so huge, that the loss of a few dozen titans is not even noteworthy anymore, and if the production of titan and supers continue to be this high, the typical losses of titan engagement will only become less and less meaningful, since replacing those losses is becoming so easy due to the ability to have 100% safe mass stockpile of titans and supers in your home regions.
---
This video is a good video. My favourite EVE videos are thematic, long form PvP compilations with sick music.
---
Tick, tick, tick.
---
I think it'd be on SiSi by now if it were coming in September. And it's not. Mabye it's coming later, or not coming at all.
---
Anyone who has ever dropped on people knows how its going to go. 1) People are going to stop using caps for offensive drops and are going to switch to T3 fleets and stuka fleets being dropped in by SB's with cynos fit off grid so the defender can't snipe the  cyno ship or see it pop up on the overview. 2) The umbrellas are going to keep doing business as usual because the people who can afford an umbrella can afford recons to drop and faxes to keep the cynos alive. 3) Within a month or two everyone who though this would stop people from dropping 250 on their 8 man nano roaming gang will be crying about how they are now being dropped by t3c blobs and how booshing stuka fleets are overpowered. 4) CCP will come up with some other hair brained idiot way of trying to enable 8 guys to fight a 1,000 man alliance because the reddit crowd told hilmar that's what is wrong with the game.
---
Cisatracurium and Propofol is a bad combination.
---
First time I've seen another player name their ships after Pharmaceuticals, as I do with the things I draw up at the hospital for IVs.
---
lol that chimmy
---
By before the true blue donut, do you mean the time when the map was split by the CFC and NCPL? Or Bob and RedSwarm?
---
And then die the second you turn the cloak off to light the cyno. People seem to be missing the part where the second these changes go through people are going to primary every single recon they see the second they see it because they know its the only way the opponent can counter their caps now. The game is going to switch to whoever gets caps on field first wins because all their subs will spend the rest of the fight killing any cyno ships they see while their caps continue to be just as oppressive as ever because CCP isn't adressing the issue of HAW guns being OP they are trying to avoid that issue by making it harder to get the OP thing on grid.
---
This has confirmed it. I am resubbbing and flying frigs around solo until I get the hang of the game again. Though I might need to abandon my plan to fly around in Comets, you made them look weak haha
---
google play tells me to gtfo with my phone version. Google nexus 5.
---
Wot?
---
Hia, we are indeed a new bro friendly corp. The griffin pilot was using a t1 fitted ship. We where surprised he got that many jams off like he did... was a super fun fight.
---
What
---
He calls her Daddy now Man it's weird
---
Empress Catiz I, formerly of House Tash-Murkon.
---
It was the only ship on contract in system. He had isk and just said YOLO
---
The pulot never flies ECM and just wamted to try it. It was a great fight.
---
Well, I keep trying other games and I keep coming back to EVE, so... yep.
---
kudos to him
---
It's not Vegas, but you're severely discounting the Gaslamp. San Diego is well equipped to host a horde of nerds, it's where they have Comic Con every year. There's plenty of night life for whatever R-rated debauchery you'll want to partake in.
---
I heard that some stain guys are back... but forgot their name
---
That's a good one. Yes, overlay these please.
---
&gt;vs one coallion (Winterco, which is mainly just 1 alliance)
---
\+ PH and PL.
---
Yeah luckily I was only rocking +3 's in that clone ha
---
Singing despacito on a corner in Vegas for loose change?
---
Until you realize that the ship still has limited fitting space and can't possibly be effective at all those bonuses.
---
Astute observation.
