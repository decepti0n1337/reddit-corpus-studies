Epic gamer moment

Depends on how good your corp is. But my old corp would pop out of one of our static worhmoles into nullsec and take down targets. Depends on what corp you join is to what content they find.
---
It is similar to most other areas of space; people tend to only engage when they have an overwhelming advantage.
---
It was most likely RMT. It likely that they would delivered their goods using methods that creates obuscated logs, or no logs at all.
---
One word. Odin's Call. That's right, it was actually two words but that doesnt matter. We're a tightly knit learning community that lives in a C2-NS/C5. Our home system is great for content as we get battles from both the Nullsec connection and the Wormhole side.

You can still solo some L5s with a Raven or most L5s with two ravens. Or barghests if you're up for spending a carrier's worth.
---
The pvp was mainly sneaking around and choosing the right engagements. There is no Local chat so you never know how many people are nearby. So it's more tactical kind of pvp with small gangs. No dropping capitals or anything like that.
---
But you can mjd out of a bubble when not scammed right?

Wormholes are small gang to medium sized fleet (no cyno blobbing). The exact content and fleets depend which group you find to join, but when it's not an eviction most wormhole content (aside from ganking explorers/miners) is brawling armour cruiser/BC sized compositions.

It's fun, you should do it!

Goddamn nostalgia.

I'm pretty sure it was a bug. Gotta say though warping back to station in my rifter had my palms sweating after I saw that loot value. At the time noob me was getting most his isk from venture mining.
---
Imagine caring so much about zkill that you shoot the remaining dread to get in it's killmail, if it even died. But also try to eject from your ship to deny others the killmail as if that changes anything..

---
CCP's response to people getting upset that they can see people on their overview who are several AU away is to just let them kill eachother
---
While there are sites in the hole. If (numbers pulled from ass) you make 1.25B ISK running all the sites in the hole, but it takes you 15 minutes before you run out, that's technically 5B ISK/hr if you extrapolate it to the full hour, but not 5B isk in your pocket.
---

That is fucking cool. Nicely done CCP.

There are exactly 19 systems with this effect, and of those only 1 has another C6 static.

2 if you count the shattered.

Mids - b-type 50mn micro, 2 faction LSE over 2 passive resistance amps for flavour. 
---
I love this thing. 
---
And sorry, it's 927 dps cold. 1073 hot. 
---
I try to get missions that deal mostly kin/them as it frees up 2 mid slots for whatever you want! Painter/web? Done. 
---
This thing is a fucking beast.
---
Divide by the total hours you scan and wait for site to spawn and you get 20mil isks per hour congrats
---
u pull 50-60bil a month if you run all your sites which is 4 sessions of krabbing or like 15 hours of effort
---
Single player can have that if they are total nerds and play extremely boring way. But alliances often dont have that high efficiency.
---
It’s a sandbox game and if you want to play it like a turboretard then it’s ok but mechanics should try to make it harder.

If you haven’t played as omega then it’s still perfectly fun as an alpha, you can do a lot! 
---
If you’ve been omega for a bit though it’s hard to go back.
---
It's not something I'd ever bring to a PvP engagement because literally any other command ship would do better - but if you don't want to manage cap for pve work - only having to worry about the mwd cycle is nice. 
---
And even on the roughest bits of PvE work - between the 28k shield hp and the 70hp/s passive regen I never have an issue removing points, killing incoming dps before my shields hit half and start gaining faster than they lower.
---
It can round out for em, kin and therm with crazy numbers. I only have 74 exp resistance though. That's using 2 passive em wards, one a-type and 1 c-type.
---
I generally shy away from heavy explosive dps due to having amarrian hulls better suited for it and the overall omni of this leaves a bit to be desired. 
---
But if you want to whore 4s in Caldari space - you will *never* lose this thing. Just keep your fit under a Bil and the ISK required to take it from you is way more prohibitive than what you've spent.
---
Depends on the corp and what they focus on/ class and statics they live in. In some very broad strokes a few categories would be:
---
\- the C2 C5/null corps like odin's call, tuskers, (and now hard knocks I guess) that focus a great deal on null sec roaming/raiding.
---
\-C4 C5/C4,3,2 corps are generally more mid to beginning level learning corps that lean high on numbers (perhaps 60-100 active players max), but lack the experience or desire to field cap fleets regularly. The C4 aids them in having access to C5 space's isk and higher end content for more experienced members and a low class space for easily attained isk for low SP members. Examples could include Pos Party and wormhole society.
---
\-C5 C5 corps often have reasonable numbers and skill to the point where they can field heavy armor and/or heavy shield fights, generally composing 2-3 caps per side (usually 1 triage 2 dreads) and roughly 30 subcap pilots in various support ships and DPS comps (i.e loki/damnation/nighthawk et cetera). These fights are some of the most sp and isk intensive fights that can be  found in eve, and yet are still limited to reasonable numbers by wormhole mass so that every pilot matters. C5 corps are also aided by the C5 highway (there are a very large number of C5-C5 holes and thus connect to each other often) so they can often have very large chains of wormholes that lead to all over new eden. Letting C5 corps dabble in pretty much all eve has to offer. Examples include No Vacancies, Lazerhawks, and Scary Wormhole People.  
---
As for general experience, wh space takes a little more effort than living in a large null block, but in my opinion significantly more rewarding. Scanning is critical obviously, comps are generally much more isk/sp/real skill intensive, and spontaneous small (2-10 players) kitchen sink brawls can be common. Although logistics are still pretty easy so long as you scan your chain reasonably often. Isk scales C1-6, and C5/6 ratting offers the bast isk/hr in the game at 1bil+ (if you use dreads), but also more dangerous as anyone can roll in at anytime. Some drawbacks are that combat sites don't respawn in system like null, so you can't contentiously grind for as much isk as you want. And chains are random and as such content can also be random and prone to floods and droughts. However, if you like to actually make a difference in fights, and tired of being someone's N+1 I highly suggest you try it out.
---
Then where were they when Goons attacked? Certainly not in fleet

very cool thank u

thanks for commenting letting me that you think my post is cool

Yep, big blunder
---
If only we’d bent the knee too, we could be strong and respected like GOTG is now
---
It's not blingy by any means in my opinion - except the mwd. It's kind of unnecessary and a throwback from my first attempt at an active tank on it - just never removed it.
---
This thing is a fucking brick that can spit impressive dps in niche roles. 
---
Would I bring it to a fleet engagement? Probably not. Drunkenly kill 4s with friends like a pubbie? I can't even lose this thing while blacked out lol
---
&gt;It’s a sandbox game and if you want to play it like a turboretard then it’s ok but mechanics should try to make it harder.
---
there is no effective difference between how high end players play in nullsec and 'high end' players play in highsec
---
they are selective with their fights, why is that a bad thing?
---
Fun fact, killing a empty ship still generates a killmail from the last pilot in the ship. Being panfam they'd have just killed it anyway. Also blue whoring is standard.

     Hey at least yours partially cloaks... I had a bug for months that caused my covops cloak to get crazy long reactivation times occationally when I would Decloak and take a gate, sometimes 1-2-3 mins... Other times 35 mins 55 mins.  One time I was in a viator with 6b in the cargo hold, went from lowsec to nullsec and got a 40+ min reactivation.  Had to safe log because only way I could ever fix it was to dock unfit and refit module couldn't offline and online it so without NPC/blue stations I was screwed.
---
      After three tickets to CCP one lost viator (empty thankfully) figured it would never get fixed.... Then suddenly one day I realized it hadn't happened in months lol thank Bob.

---
How do I go about this? Do any of you guys have experience with this? 
---
I’m so lost and confused. I haven’t really spoken to her since she’s told me. I’m not sure why she only told me now and not at the beginning of our relationship.
---
I would argue that it is not, however I know several F2P players that do indeed play the game 100% F2P earning their Omega with 100% ISK Grind. I would say it really depends on what you want to do, how often you're willing to pay, and how patient you're willing to be. Grinding for sub takes dedication, and a lot of work. If you want to mine for sub you're out of luck, the only profitable way to mine is with omega and a lot of training. PvP isn't all that profitable in the first place depending on how you do it so that's out of the question, let alone with alpha skills. I'd say train into wormhole ratting ships and rat in WHs, easiest and best isk in the game.

First I know. Thats why I said NO % increase. You can see it in my post above if you read it.
---
Second it doesnt proc more for less time.
---
The drone cycle time remains at 20 sec.
---
The lenght of the jam IF it hits is now only 5 secs when it was 20 so theres a 15 sec gap in the jam time where the drone is just doing nothing now.
---
My complaint is its not a balance.
---
A balance would be appling the jam time change but giving it a % increase in the chance it will hit, even a small one, this would still leave them as a viable option.

I’m glad your study don’t find a correlation with psychological well-being. I suspect it’s like many things: the vulnerable few are deeply affected while the majority are not.

Sure, but without buying a sub, you can still gradually round out your "main" a little, as much as the alpha skill limitations allow. And daily alpha injectors tend to be a little cheaper per so than regular injectors.
---
You certainly shouldn't grind for it, but a little boost here and there as the wallet allows is possible.

 I can't believe in 2 years with 60m/hour you haven't made any progress unless you trained something useless to your progression as a pve character,like say science skills.
---
  If you been using PLEX to sub it can  be causing your frustration as you're essentially spending 35-40 hours monthly so you can spend 35-40 more hours next month maintaining this vicious cycle.
---
 My best advice is change scenery mix it up get out of the monotonous vni grind train for a t3 do some DED sites,train for hacking go and bust some of those null data sites.You may call it wasted time but if you have good npcs like Guristas or Bloods their 6/10s can drop over a bil in loot.

Well, you have to remember that wow is a fully detailed world for every square inch of soil. Eve, on the other hand, is mostly empty space. All you have to do is update the animations, and the planet textures. Not the entire foundation of the game. I'm sure I'm simplifying what is required for Eve but still.

I'd rather see the other navy frigates get tweaked; the comet is so much fun to fly and it gives alphas/sharp newbies a fantastic platform for learning about kiting, scram kiting, brawling, drone combat, different kinds of tank, etc, and to punch above their weight a little earlier than perhaps expected. It may hold the edge on other navy faction frigs on average, particularly in lowsec, but it's not game-breaking and the other navy frigates are very capable of beating comets while being fun in their own right.
---
First ever day in nullsec, I looted a cormack's modified magnetic field stabilizer. It was from the rat.  Damn thing nearly killed me too.

technically speaking botting and RMT was legal on Serenity. you may think to yourself that you wouldnt do it cause its scummy. but especially in eve where people always try get an edge over their competitors you would eventually have to give in and conform to the norm in order to just keep up the pace of isk influx and materials needed for the machines of war.

As much as you may consider that behaviour to carry over to tranquility, bans for that may only actually affect those players who are willfully ignorant of the policy differences. And i imagine PIBC leadership will inform their members of the differences.

Unpopular opinion but, is the fact that you had to post this for validation a sign of you not having thick enough skin to let it go. Sure he doesn't have thick skin but neither do you if it effected you so much that you had to post it. And if it didn't effect you because this was what you were seeking then I'd just consider it harrasment. So why do you not have thick skin or why is it your harrasing the eve community?

I mean think about it, if unfilled orders were counted the donchian channel for every product would go from 1isk to 1trillion isk, based on all the fake/scam orders that get put in.

Darkness has known this has been coming since they traded all those faction stations to goons.  Look at Darkness's sov footprint from the first day of that war to now.  They've rented, sold or traded everything they possibly can down to almost nothing.  
---
They've known this was the outcome from the moment the Imperium, anyone watching on the sidelines (like me not being subbed for over 2+ years) could see.  I just wonder how much rent and payments they got before this all happened.
---
k
---
I have never had it happen to me, but I have heard of ople getting reported for nothing more than the usual local sperg during a fight. Dont know more than that.
---
EWar modules are a "size neutral" module, and apply equally to all targets.
---
Obviously, the effect will be based on the target ship's stats and/or any bonuses the EWar ship has.
---
lmao or you know put legacy with legacy (fire) too
---

Ah, but it spawned in Delve, there's no shortage.

Are all of these tournments getting all screwed up because CCP fired that community/alliance-tourny management team back at the end of last year?  Everything used to be as smooth as silk and in the last 6 months it's like everything is ameatur hour again.  What really happened?
---
And yes I know about Pearl abyss buying CCP, so I figure they did the normal 'oh lets get rid of all these useless people that don't do anything, you know the type, HR, QA, 'special situations' we don't understand, and anything at all we consider 'redundant'.   Ahhhhh the smell of money!.   What do you mean everything is on fire?'
---
I assume it's more than that.  I left EVE 2+ years ago, I'm outta touch tbh, so just curious.
---
I haven't done any subgroup analysis yet but I may in the future. There's still data I haven't even coded yet. For example, I was asking for usernames based on Kokkinakis, Lin, Pavlas, and Wade's study (2016) on how chosen usernames predict interactions in MMOs. I wanted to see if usernames were related to sociability and gaming social capital. But I now need to code all of those usernames. I haven't had time to do so with finals coming up. So subgroup analysis is definitely a possibility for the future. There's still so much to do! 
---
Thanks for the interest. The main reason I wanted to do this study was because I'm a gamer myself, and games get such a bad rep. I wanted to look at some of the positive aspects of gaming. I'm happy I'm not the only one interested in this topic.
---
Sure. Im sick
---
I have a sudden urge to go to geminate and look if hes out in another vni or not.
---
hey look im posting in a garlic shitpost
---
Lasers are my favorite weapon system and a sansha titan for 300b would be sweet for shield fleets .  Also an angel titan would have the obvious sick falloff and warp bonuses.  Both I would imagine would be 7-7 slotted, allowing them to be used in Shield or armor fleets.  Would also give armor fleets access to an explosive Doomsday

lol apparently
---
Yea they used to be legacy affiliates
---
I fix
---
Cause NC PL share rental space goons legacy don’t
---
Agreed. And still RR and Sib Sq are pretty piss-poor. Cut the soft underbelly of their indy krab corps. Disrupt their JF/Freight routes to/from the Pentagram and Triangle (E-FIC0). They'll bleed one way or another.
---
And then I used the PC’s magnify utility. There’s not much to see. After depleting my knowledge of Latin I had to guess some letters until I got some kind of translation.
---
Or he simply found the exchange funny and wished to share? You could be right though.
---
&gt;The argument I'll get is that the lack of resistance nulls the need for balanced thrust
---
This is actually the opposite of true. If your engine configuration is slightly unbalanced in the atmosphere, aerodynamics and control surfaces (i.e. ailerons, rudders, flaps...) can compensate, hence why multi-engine planes can fly with engines only functioning on one side. In space, if your thrust isn't balanced with your centre of mass, you will either:
---
1. spin everywhere uncontrollably and not be able to actually fly anywhere, if you don't have thrust vectoring
---
2. fly a bit sideways, if you do have sufficient thrust vectoring to compensate for the thrust imbalance
---
3. have to run some engines at lower power to balance things out, assuming your engines can throttle (which EvE ones can)
---
How on earth did you keep the transparency on the banner
---
Do the pirate fobs drop anything of value?
---
&gt; Can you actually make decent isk on the bpcs?
---
Yes, but good lord are the BPOs expensive.  Most of them take **years** to earn back what you paid for them.
---
lol, was that a ratting titan ? In M-OEE8, border to lowsec ? wtf these people have in mind ? Either they are very stupid or very very rich. The latter doesn't always justify the stupidity tho... I wouldn't show alone on the grid in paper thin titan. NEVER.

Hmm I accidentally took a nap that lasted through this fleet.  Interesting.  Vysh, when you're around what would you say was the biggest problem on your end that led to the massive unbalance in performance despite outnumbering our boys considerably.
---
I’ve kicked people out of Corp/alliances for less. Fuckem
---
What rock have you been living under? Null is already heavily dominated by one side that can dick swing with Titans against any other political Bloc.
---
Ay I did buy up all the exo skins just to have a skin for all occasions
---
Until they got more Russians into their group. They are not part of Legacy Coalition, they are their own, and should be listed as such.
---
Because NC. is actually blue to the rest of PANFAM, Legacy and Imperium are not blue to each other.
---
Are you joking they’re just Legacy pets. Don’t drink the koolaid man. Maybe one day they’ll be independent but not right now.
---
Just because they say they’re independent doesn’t mean they’re not latched onto TAPIs teat

True you could be right but I think it's more along the lines of he was seeking this kind of response in that case it would be harrassing.

You can get capitals, just not titans.

If you want to play that game, might as well put Winter Coalition and Holy Rental Empire into PanFam.

Well, you can't fault him for giving himself a bit of arguing room so he doesn't get Body Exhibited.

Not entirely sure you get to complain about recycled comments with yours... It's probably the most mentioned contrarian point in this entire thread.  
---
Anyways, he's violating the Twitch TOS by:   
---
1. Not fullfilling promotions/giveaways  
---
2. Potentially violating the EVE EULA with a giveaway using real money (not fulfilling a transaction is not only still RMT, but scam contests are illegal in a lot of places)  
---
3. \*Potentially\* violating the law for the above reason  
---
4. Potential ban evasion (this is his second account, first one has been deleted or suspended)  
---
Honestly would not be surprised if you're a friend or an alt account, because no one should have to spell this out to anyone.

ppl care about nc?

This level of laziness tells me that EVE is not for you. The skill ceiling requires effort and research. If you just ask people everything you need to know,.... well...

Sometimes the faction rats spawn in regular belts too. It's rare but it can happen.

Looks like [Other ships have Latin](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/topic/86514/) on them. It is probably a Lorem Ipsum placeholder.

Has nothing to do with the koolaid. I'm sorry that you are incapable of understanding the idiosyncrasies of null sec politics. Maybe one day you will, but not today it seems.

can a hugin actually fit it? since they have pretty big fitting requirement

Those poor machs got absolutely meat grindered. Who'd have thunk jumping 50 arty machs in at 0 on a fleet of 10mn cruisers with 1 total webbing ships doesn't work? Considering there were two fax and like 10+ logi on field I'm not really sure how so many broke even before logi went down though.
---
If I had to guess it would probably be bringing one web loki to a 50 man mach fleet against 10mn cruisers.
---
Bots ... Gemini are like 99% bots. Theran Alliance are their masters. Ranger Regiment are the ones trying to get space for them and Unreal Alliance is the helping hand when Ranger Regiment fails.

I had been playing for a few weeks when I finally tried out salvaging. Warped to a site just as a rattlesnake was warping off, and got to work. He was kind enough to drop his own MTU and scoop it without looting since I couldn't afford one. There was a 300M or so implant in there and I was flabbergasted, since I assumed this is normal and I'd be rich momentarily. Imagine my disappointment in later sites :)
---
&gt; they’re just Legacy pets.
---
So not a part of Legacy.
---
&gt; Just because they say they’re independent doesn’t mean they’re not latched onto TAPIs teat
---
It does mean they're not a part of the Legacy coalition, I don't know why you're finding this concept so hard but we're here to help you through this.
---
Hmm, it's been a while since I've played, but I'll be in the area on that day.  Just gotta find somewhere nearby that I can park my semi.
---
I don’t know why you can’t seem to understand the meaning of EFFECTIVE. They’re EFFECTIVELY part of Legacy no matter what they say, you fucking mong
---
But not actually part of legacy, so that would make them...
---
Drum roll...
---
Not a member of Legacy Coalition. 
---
Next you'll be saying horde are a member of Winter.
---
As a BPO collector i am curious, do you have all that smaller BPOs as well, or just capitals and whatever you need for production?
---
&gt; there is no effective difference between how high end players play in nullsec and 'high end' players play in highsec 
---
Except that it's totally different thing. There are more groups out in null than just 5:
---
&gt; Five corporations are responsible for 50 percent of the wardecs. Destroying 105 ships for every one that they lost. Only 4 percent of defenders were able to score a single kill.
---
&gt;why is choosing only fights you can win so disgusting to you?
---
It's clearly way too easy to abuse the highsec mechanics in highsec if only 4% defenders score a kill. It's not fun gameplay. Something is wrong with the balance. This war hq stuff might fix it in some ways.

Would a Damavik or Kikimora be any good for Wolf Rayet ratting?

I lived in nullsec back then, screaming in corp comms grants you some pretty good dps. We initially brought a couple vni’s and a rattlesnake and the dps wasn’t enough... Then we just lit a cyno and an archon came to blap the officer.

That is not accurate. The main purpose of the law apparently is to establish a legal framework that allows the state to fully control the information flow between Russia and the outside Internet. No government needs a sweeping "Sovereign Internet" law just only to fund a $38M project. But sure, a law makes funding easier.

I quite like things like this TBH. Keeps people on their toes.
---
Imagine caring this much about denying people killmails
---
Well Gemini has no sov, but only relies on others to provide it for them ... so eventually Slyce or Darkness are the ones that come to help if there is nobody else left
---
I guess you mean RMT? Not like the same happened here on TQ and is still happening. CCP has other rules regarding RMT and botting then Tiancity so I don't see that much of a problem there.
---
When NC/PL were at their heights every fight they COULD lose they started dropping titans. And like I mentioned before every enitiy would probably go for a complete victory with conquering all of nullsec if they knew they could 100% win, but they can never be sure that not somone will use a shitton of isk again to unite everyone against them. The other point is the very risk averse gamestyle we have here on TQ so everyone uses their super fleet with caution because you could lose it, so better blue up a shitton of other people and have a stagnation.
---
We need a super highsec, with no pvp at all :D jk, people need to HTFU
---
They were planning this all the way back in 2016 when they left the north to colonize Delve, seeding freighters all the way back then!!
---
Lol you got bated m8
---
FOBs drop their citadel fittings, some of which can be faction (Dark Blood Heavy/XL neut, Guristas ECM). This is the only way to get those mods and they are reasonably powerful.
---
I believe they *might* also drop faction mods (where as Sotiyos drop multiple faction and at least 1 guaranteed officer module) but I am not certain.

Oh fuck, he got killt AND kicked from his corp?
---
I know Goons play to win, but this is some next level pvping.
---
I bet this has been asked a billion times already, but when is it ever appropriate to use the more absurdly priced officer/faction modules? I'm asking because I have been primarily playing mining, and I cannot imagine a situation where, for example, an ORE Miner or Aoede MLU would not immediately send out a gank bait alert to every pirate in a 10-jump radius. Is there ANY situation where these niche modules are actually advisable? I actually could afford to buy them and it'd help my profits but I'm pretty sure I'd be blown out of the sky within an hour of the purchase, regardless of tank.

&gt;isn't against any rules in EVE as far as I know

I guess for imp news? Surely ads on a site that gets maybe 10k unique views per week bring in the big money right?
---
Depends where you mine and what ship you're using.
---
If you sit in Null by all means bling your Rorqual *^(with Tank)*  but if you're a highsec Pubbie in a Procurer you don't really need to do so.
---
I guess no, Confessor should still be your best choice for its superior active tank and range variety from different lenses.
---
It can mitigate a lot of damage in Defense Mode too.
---
Also its way, **waaay** cheaper!
---
like a train terminal solution?
---
idk, i haven't seen any adverts for anything from the imperium lately.

I feel that f2p is fun if you're in a group or fleet. An extra person is always welcome.

For solo pve, it's doable. You won't make more isk than subscribers, but you're playing for free, so in a way you're winning by default.
---
For solo PvP, alphas suck. Its much better subscribing, so you can chase juicy targets.

Capital Ancillary Shield Booster Blueprint with 5 runs. Sold it for around 3b before the big nerfs.

This is some real shit

That reminds me of a time when I got to the Sleeper relic site for the second time. I couldn't do anything to them on my Heron but  I decided to kite them away for 300km, warp to the site and have a very limited time to unlock all crates before they come back. Stuff like that is why I like Eve. You can come up with a shitty tactics and sometimes it works and the game rewards you for it. That makes you feel smarter or something like that.
---
This is the cringiest post ever.... tldr you bent the knee and kicked a guy because you was petrified that NC might kick down your space sandcastle
---
I'm not up to date with the eve stuff over there. What do you mean by that?
---
I mean.... it's a stupid design yeah but on the other hand more things exploding isn't bad
---
No, but that does literally translate as "fascist" and it's pronounced exactly the same in Russian as it is English.
---
They were keepstar routes to your space. They were there to make it easier to move supers to defend you. was a GOTG region. MOA and KOS lived there after Horde left. PB was a GOTG region. 
---
I know you like to think that those numbers are actually good for you, but they are not. In that post your average fleet numbers are 152. Co2 had an average of 63. Co2 had 2500 players, while GOTG had over 10000. 
---
Yes. Horde brought useless jamming ceptors, no one have said that wasn't retarded. But the keepstars would have died even if horde brought 100 titans. The fights wouldn't have gone better. The attackers have the advantage of being on field first, and in a 1k titan battle thats op. 
---
 The narrative was never that you didn't show up, but that you didn't carry your weight. An coalition of that size should have no problem flashforming 250 man fleets every day.  There were multiple battles daily over Ihubs (the only viable thing to defend keepstars) that you didn't show for. That post only lists 15 out of hundreds of battles, many that only co2 and horde showed for.
---
why would anyone want to be "left alone" in a fucking PVP spaceship game
---
Just avoid rl shit and you're good, really. It doesn't matter how much profanity and violence you throw at people in game, as long as it's in game.
---
Of course people could also try not to get overly attached to their ratting VNIs... but I suppose some people just can't help themselves.
---
Is this different from any other year?
---
Not even dual rep fit with a cap booster, max tank is fake news, maybe like, 80% tanked  
---
disapointed in these clickbait titles
---
Thanks for continuing this, look forward to more (-:
---
I remember being told a long time ago that if you eject with less than 5% structure the ship will go kaboom without any kill mail. Something to do with the pilots skills giving it that extra Hull and when he leaves the ship it just explodes
---
Level 4 burner missions or a public incursion group like warptome. both have a low enough set up cost that you can easily fund them even from just vni ratting.
---
I am actually ok with OP ships, at least in FW, you get to pick what you engage, the stronger a ship, the less people want to engage it. It's sort of self balancing.
---
good job
---
Hi Eve-(ers?), I'm really interested in playing Eve. I have extensively played X3, X4 Foundations and Elite Dangerous (I know, this one isn't that complex, but I still like it). How much of Eve is accessible for F2P-ers? How steep is Eve learning curve compared to X3? Thanks in advance.
---
I think  [Dangerous Voltage](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Dangerous%20Voltage)  left Legacy and joined FIRE. as they are russians too.
---
To be honest, I found Eve very generous for alphas. You can fly all T1/faction ships (up to battleships) you can use T2 medium weapons (drones, turrets etc.) So you can be somewhat capable as an alpha. You can fit out a decent PvP cruiser with those skills.
---
HOWEVER, when I came back to the game and started playing as an alpha, I was already well above the 5 mil skill point cap.
---
You can use daily alpha booster to pass the cap (I don't know the pricing, it was around 60 mil when I was using them).
---
Recently, restrictions have been put in place on certain mission types for alpha players (level 4 missions, not sure about level 3)
---
I'm Omega now, I'd recommend subscribing, but like i said alpha is a great way to get into the game and it's pretty flexible. I think if you know how to focus your skills you can probably get decent use out of the 5 mil skillpoints.
---
(Inb4 bittervets saying they have a zillion SP)
---
Dafuq are you on about. HiSec is so damn calm. I operated in HiSec when i first joined the game, i lived there for maybe 3-4 months. I got banked once. Cant get any more care-bear than that
---
Need a bunch of fitting mods and maybe an implant, but yes you can make it fit. 16
---
what is tank?
---
I always wanted to come back to Deklein for old times sake...
---
It's very difficult to not shoot the random freighter autopiloting.
---
Can we interest you in some delicious Kool-aid Rick ?
---
thx for repling, do you use a specific rids ?
---
Eve is very easy to try out as free to play, you can do almost everything, albeit on a limited level. If you play long term you'll want to subscribe, but if you just want to try it out and see what it is like then alpha is good.
---
The learning curve is pretty steep, but not as bad as it once was. The tutorial is still not very useful, but only because teaching the complex parts of fleet vs fleet combat when you're a single player fighting only AI is nearly impossible. However, plenty of large groups exist that will take in day one new players and I suggest you join one of them for at least a few weeks just to get on your feet; if you don't like it feel free to leave and run around faction warfare lowsec or something looking for different corps to join. Just make sure to be on comms and be joining fleets, if you don't do those things then no one can help you learn.

Alpha clones were added in the Ascension expansion, which release date is 2016. Technically, this mean that the OP was already playing one year prior to their implementation, so it would technically mean he’s already Omega, or at least already was.
---
Even as an Alpha Clone you can have a pretty decent Rattlesnake toon, so that’s already more money I guess. And if he’s in nullsec, he can probably run DED sites.

Yep that's why I stopped playing 😂 once they changed the engagement rules for high sec systems and killed off can flipping or solo pirating by making it so everyone can attack u not just the Corp u attacked it felt very different. Now it's just blob camps and very few roaming small ship gangs

fire and kwg are legacy affiliates, they're not separate, although fire aren't technically part of legacy so affiliate is probably most accurate.

@CCPlease add soft shadows, and fix the shadow obscurring that occurs from the pov of the camera, this occurs when near keepstars where depending on where the camera is the ship can either be in sunlight or shadow which is wrong it shouldn't matter where the camera is I think now that we have RTX you can perform actual raycasts from the light source and not from the camera, will make the game more realistic and wont be a bad performance hit because for some reason eve only has single sun solarsystems not saying that thats wierd but ita also pretty inaccurate their should be binary or trinary star systems...

I have found a True sansha in hi sec belt, dropped stuff over 900 mills, so no this is not bullshit, i got low grade omega and other nice things.

T5 Gamma have great bonus to shield amount, but it also applies to the enemies which are more numerous, so I guess it would be hard to complete the site in the limited time

Volta is no longer with skill urself, also the rest of alliances are renters (besides da imbalance). I'd rather not make the list like snuff than have it being so wrong.

---
&gt; Except that it's totally different thing. There are more groups out in null than just 5:
---
i mean there are a lot more groups in highsec than in nullsec, so that's just wrong
---
&gt;Five coalitions are responsible for 90 percent of the kills.
---
&gt;It's clearly way too easy to abuse the highsec mechanics if only 4% defenders score a kill. 
---
statistics don't imply balance, these people play in a way to make it so they rarely lose ships, they choose their fights and lose a lot of legitimate targets in order to attain that level of efficiency. it looks like their only sin is that they're too good at the game.
---
&gt;It's not fun gameplay. 
---
it's not about being fun, if you want to anchor structures you open yourself up to wardecs. anchoring a structure and getting fucked when you're unable to defend yourself isn't supposed to be 'fun'.
---
&gt;Something is wrong with the balance. 
---
this assertion has yet to be proven
---
&gt;This war hq stuff might fix it in some ways.
---
you're fucking braindead if you think it would. a 600m raitaru can be anchored and lasts over a week. that's a fraction of the cost of their wardecs anyway.
---
Buy a Russian for the purpose
---
Me neither. Reading [the full article about it](https://newedenreport.com/2019/04/18/the-fall-of-aphelion/), it seems very ruthless and I wouldn't be surprised if most of the players in that corp quit the game.
---
I keep reading about evictions that they typically don't happen unless you really piss someone off. Looks like all Wormlife did wrong was to say no to a 25 bil extortion.
---
&gt; why would someone start hitting your structures over some shit tier reddit posting?

Huh interesting, last time I was in Frulegur there was at least 10-12 of them but its been a few months.

It's fairly easy, although I was running with 3 LSE's (2 modified T2's) and 2 t2 adaptive's (one thermal switched in for firestorms), as long as you knock out the right stuff first it's a bit of a doddle.
---
T5 gamma's you need a good bit of luck regarding spawns. I managed to run about half a dozen of those before getting 3 consecutive Drifter Assassin waves in one site... the 700-odd dps on tap wasn't enough to clear it in time. That said, the loot/mat drops from those seemed quite nice.

This article is a few days old but I still wanted to post it since it's very well written and feels like it's newsworthy enough to be its own reddit post. It feels to me like an entire playstyle - industrial corp in a C1-null WH - has been shown to be unviable.
---
this is total bullshit
---
nullsec doesn't have a force that consistently appears in fractions of a minute that instantly kills anyone who attacks you

Go to Provi sure but don't get comfortable and stay there. You'll hate it.

there is no other game like eve online, so what the heck are you taking, you should stop

When was the last time Imp and Legacy fought each other in sov warfare, each other or against same structure?
---
Just curious.
---
Bro, just join Goons and hop in our standing fleet. Theta squad will be there faster than CONCORD and with cooler ships. 
---
Just make sure you’re not shitfit.
---
If you cant fit a cloak don't spend the money on an astero. Use a T1 scanner or a Sunesis, both of which offer better performance/cost than the astero without a cloak.

Ever shitpost so hard your own body tries to make you stop?
---
Can i buy the salt u mined? I need it for my reactions
---
yes. You should not go burners at once, but instead start blitzing in HS.
---
So first use a mach and learn to blitz;
---
Then use a garmur for anomic teams, and start training rockets to V and caldari frig to V ;
---
when you have the money, buy a dedicated arty mach for dread pirate scarlett, becasue this mission is worth … 8M implant +10M bounty + reward + LP in 6 min.
---
When you get assault frig IV-V you can start getting more missions : 
---
 - caldary frig V and good missile skills unlocks agent serpentis in a hawk
---
 - gallente frig V and good navigation skills unlocks agent guristas in a enyo
---
 - minmatar frig V and good turret skills unlocks the blood agent in a wolf.
---
  - minmatar frig 5, gallente frig V and a lot of engineering/gunnery skills to 5 (really) unlock agent sansha/angel in two different daredevil fits.
---
After that you can train to minamatar cruiser V and gallente cruiser V, HAC V then train the abyssal cruiser to good skills (including weapons)
---
 - minmatar cr V unlocks the base angel in vigilant. though the skills is not required to use the ship, it's required to complete the missions without overloading anything and no booster.
---
 - HAC V allows to use an efficient vagabond for the serpentis base. you can use less efficient T2 gallente/caldari CR or BC  but as I said they are so bad it's not worth doing this mission unless you have good vagabond skills.
---
 - abyssal cr V allows to do the base blood in a very efficient ship and with very low issues.
---
The price tag is (less than)
---
 - 1B for the initial mach
---
 - 700M for the arty mach.
---
 - 200M for the initial garmur (not pimped)
---
 - then 500-800M for each frigate (pimped) though you can use unpimped verisons
---
 - 1B for each cruiser
---

It is a very nice killmail.
---
And in null you can bubble fuck your in gate, while knowing that everyone in local is friendly to you. And Safe up when a neutral enters local. It’s pretty fucking safe too.
---
Oh Tuz honey, I am used to better from you. Have a nice cup of coffee before posting next time :)
---
cash from streaming eve lol.
---
what makes the rev strong at small drops is its ab bonus making it very slippery and its application bonus making it very effective at killing tackle
---
the ab bonus alone would make a sansha titan extremely strong for drive-bys, but the double damage/4 turret loadout similar to the molok would open up utility slots for things like a neut and smartbomb while still fitting 3-4 haw guns, which even post-nerf are still strong at clearing tackle and small ships
---
The Problem is that the whole gallente line is very strong. This means all the other factions have less people in them. Therefor one empire is always dominating as they wish. And before anyone comes with caldari currently ahead thats only because the big boys in gallente want to cash out. As soon as they made their money it swings right back
---

TEST brought in three Komodos to save those rorqs, not just one. Source: I was one of them.
---
Do we know mango staging yet?
---
Too much abstraction. In reality what you're trying to express is that a viewer watching a stream can receive items from a streamer in-game. However, CCP state explicitly, that all viewers must be eligible for sweep stakes and must not be exclusive to subscribers or people who have donated.
---
Setting stream goals for sweep stakes is perfectly fine too, I think. I.E: If I get 100 subscribers, I will give away 100 frigates to all viewers to celebrate kind of deal.
---
However, the final example is highly suspect since "stream points" is essentially trying to avoid the first example by "weighting" the chance of winning from free viewers. I would personally say that this contravenes the spirit of CCP's twitch policy as you are still effectively giving in-game items for cash by heavily weighing chances that are tied to your monetary gain.
---
That's not to say that "stream points" cannot be fair, if sweep stakes were capped at say 2 points and a viewer only had to watch for an hour to accumulate 2 points with more points awarded for subscribing or donating, then they effectively have the same change / participation as someone who is paying. It falls into a realm of what we can debate is reasonable. A sub / donater might be able to participate in more sweep stakes or redeem additional functions / perks / benefits from the points but ultimately free viewers are not being excluded and thus there is no real guarantee of in-game profiteering by effectively laundering the in-game items through cap-less sweep stakes. 
---
If however, there is no cap and, in fact, there is a direct link / trade between donating, subcribing or long-time viewing that allows you to redeem items then there isn't any sweep stake and it is direct trade of monetary value or viewership for in-game items and I cannot see that was what CCP intended but, most likely, directly contradicts what they intended.
---
I think a possible objective test for this can be simple. Can I reliably redeem an in-game item by using money on the streamer's channel? If yes, you are committing RMT in my book.
---
Two Nineteen is an awesome cigar lounge.
---
cool story
---
'yaaaawn'
---
People are mad because of the degree of botting that Chinese players do. You can say we have boys on tranquility buy it pales in comparison to serenity.
---
Another worry is that the Chinese players are absolutely zealous in having server dominance and stomping out any and all resistance. Fault goons for what you want but  I don't think they are dumb enough to completely kill their enemies. Having just one group win and control all of nullsec is the end of eve.
---
I may be gay

Fairly certain that last one is a no go

You're elite sweetie :)

If I remember, wasnt someone also busted for #2, when their random viewer was not random?
---
I have a better way to RMT that is fool proof. I go to the sperm bank and wank for a few minutes. Then I take the €42 they gave me for my gallon of baby batter and buy beer. Then I buy ISK from a Russ at the pub.
---
Imagine caring so much as to pay for and then deliver so many shuttles to someone and then detsroy them just for the killboard alone.
---
They did, yeah.
---
More players Yay
---
He did, hpwever, denied that KM to almost 50 people. Out of 95 total on grid.
---
You so mossad
---
Begun the memes wars have
---
that's... surprising
---
Couple of alliances should be removed from Provibloc:
---
Elemental Tide - Left Provi during the PL invasion, moved further south, joined one of the new coalitions that started to pop up around that time, proceeded to die.
---
The Fourth District -  Folded into CVA years ago, at this point isn't much more than a glorified alt corp.
---
TSOE Consortium - Were kicked out due to inactivity, at this point pretty much completely dead.
---
That last one looks pretty dodgy and pretty much the same thing as scenario #1.
---
Number 2 is the only one I'd say is okay as long as it's truly random. u/CCP_Falcon, What say you?
---
Good reads
---
Yea, I can't be the only one with the opinion that any reciprocal ISK/Goods given back to a viewer in exchange for a cash donation is RMT, full stop.  
---
I get people can sub and give cash to streamers they like, but the entire "contest/giveaway isk" in exchange for direct tips should be restricted by CCP's rule.  
---
It maybe be fine in other games, but it has larger impacts in Eve.  
---
Botting isn't getting better, and CCP doesn't even have a community team to police/enforce the game now. So, I don't know why I'd even bother asking them to be more attentive to this, it's a fools errand.
---
Same thing happened to me, less than a week old.  Now it's 12 years later, what am I still doing here?
---
My poor JF, what a rookie move.
---
They're _all_ a no-go.
---
CCP can't confirm or deny that things are "truly random", that's why we can't have casinos anymore. There's no way any of these are a good idea.
---
This looks awesome :D
---
Then he wasn't busted for no2 then ?
---
Well Maybe finally change Will come to nullsec

---
You either do gay, or do not gay. There is no try gay

Number 2 is still RMT.  You get cash for your ISK.  That's kind of the definition of RMT.

I really wish that, after three or more threads about one streamer, CCP would weigh in on this. It really frustrates me that I can play a game, create content for 8 hours a day, and get 1/3 the views of a rerun of someone not even interacting with viewers and performing an idle activity. Why bother even creating content?
---
I know this thread isn't directly about him. But, come on. It is.
---
That's it!

Something something, half of eve does this, something something. Cool story bro :)
---
kicked for posting on reddit? What is Rote the new North Korea?
---
You know what would blown your mind doe? Tiananmen Square in '89 was already round 2.
---
There was a political protest in 1976 as well against the Gang of Four (a political cadre of 4 people that held power in China), it's just that the protest in '76 had some political backers that eventually won and got into power and sort of retconned it into being acceptable and patriotic. The protest in '89 wasn't similarly blessed, so tanks and water hoses time.
---
To expand on this: direct transaction is bad. Always use a "buffer" between you (who gets money) and the viewer (who gets ISK, Plex, ships etc). But make sure all kinds of money transfer happen via Twitch (donation, bits etc) instead of relying on a third party/GTC reseller. 
---
* 2nd scenario works like \[this\]([https://i.imgur.com/O9Co644.png](https://i.imgur.com/O9Co644.png)) . You get money in exchange for ISK but it's not RMT because the viewer who gets ISK may not be the same viewer who gave cash, and if he is, he only contributed to a fraction of the total cash goal. BONUS: you can make the "random winner" not so random but it's at your own risk!
---
* 3rd scenario works like \[this\]([https://i.imgur.com/gYnJt1O.png](https://i.imgur.com/gYnJt1O.png)) . You get money in exchange for ISK but it's not RMT because the viewer gets ISK only after converting his "points" into ingame prizes. \[this guy\]([https://www.twitch.tv/xraynorz](https://www.twitch.tv/xraynorz)) has been doing it for a long time without any trouble apparently  ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

What's not pictured on this BR is RC's constant reinforcement throughout the fight off a titan bridge in Camal through a cyno 250km above the KBP gate in B-W onto a cyno jammed grid. We had to fight them, we had a node war for that constellation. He did a much better job than this BR would seem to indicate, especially considering what he had.
---
That guy is also trying to draw parallels between his and the most recent ban cases which is a little ridiculous to be fair.

While I was thinking about its slipperiness, I completely forgot about the damage bonus meaning it would only use 3 or 4 guns, leaving a lot of free high slots.  Stuff like 2 high-end officer smartbombs and a boson would fit without compromising dps - so I guess the thing could 1 shot cycle any bubbles then jump out if not hic pointed.
---
But ya, in fleet combat I imagine you would still see it brought by its pilots - but always being a minor component of any fleet.

Perhaps the only thing that could get me playing again at this point is bringing back Eve-bet... I've yet to find a replacement for my betting on Indian minor league cricket fix.
---
So pretty much what happened was there was a talwar fleet and I was being cheeky trying to boson them. Charon was called on the taisy gate. Warped and killed that then my doctor alt say the talwars on the e- gate. Warped to a pearch missed my boson like a boss and say an atron light a cyno. Chuckled to myself for the fuck up and left to make a samach while some retards in place lost their mind over a game. All and all I had fun.
---
You realize that the Imperium as a coalition is actually grossly outnumbered by RestOfEvE.Exe? The blue doughnut that people cry about all the time isn't goons, it's the people who join forces any time goons so much as sneeze the words "war" "invasion" "deployment". The same people who can't be asked to commit... to anything much less an actual invasion of delve.

To anyone not understanding what I'm talking about this is the 'scam.' In non-strategic ops, they will roam each others space for content to farm the dummies.

At best it would be PANFAM+Legacy+GOTG which would give pretty much even numbers. But that will never happen as Legacy is with Goons atm.

what about making t2 titans?
---
He sought help from three people. As a alliance leader it should be his job to know the right people, he failed the political meta game of eve.
---
There are plenty of people in eve to help his cause, be it for a slice of power or isk.
---
Okay...? Sounds like you don't enjoy Eve itself, then.
---
Yeah, the skybox is awesome. But what i'm almost sure he meant is that the actual game space is 99% empty with stuff floating around here and there (like actual space). Which means there's a lot less to work on than a world with a environment that isn't just a giant skybox.

---
FW Question:
---
I'm trying to deplex a site in a 0% contested system (but the timer on the site itself has been run down a bit), I can't see a time and it doesn't look like the bar is moving at all.  Can you not deplex a site in a non contested system at all, even if the site itself has been contested?
---
And a massive one too. Holy balls!
---
I prefer my method.  Giveaway at the beginning and end of the stream, random viewer wins.  I don't care if I get 0 subs or 5 million subs that stream, same thing goes.
---
Who left for CO2 at that time? Also didn't a lot of the corps join alliances such as GOTG now that CO2 was basically dead, but ended up returning once they got up and running again?
---
It depends if viewers who didn't donate are eligible to win
---
Have an upvote from an old crusty dude who's blood pressure rises every time someone complains about eve being too hard.
---
That reinforcement is displayed on the br of they got on a kill. Are you a moron?
---
And when CCP makes changes to try to help newcomers get into the game, people post “They’re killing EVE!”
---
if they do take on one of the big blocks l think they will call it that just for the memes
---
I think the viewer giveaways are okay as long as you aren't required to pay to enter.
---
Last and first one look like the same thing, just with more steps
---
yeah. it was mostly corps that went to gotg after impass co2 died, was still a good portion of their numbers though. As to who, almost every corp in co2 came from gotg
---
All three of these have issues.  It is my opinion that anything given to the streamer that is of the physical world and is outside of the game that causes an action for something inside of the game to be given is an issue.    If you want to give something away in game it needs to be received in game.  I think CCP has been very clear on this and anyone that comes even close to RMT will get shut down.
---
Lmfao, yes let's make the biggest and longest skill train ships even easier for smooth brains.
---
We loved you in A4D Wally!
---

In theory, sure, but there's no way to be certain that they're actually random.

In practice, there's quite a major potential for RMT.
---

---
Interesting I think everyone in local was saying someone named Cj  from provi did it.
---
Not very valuable, but very satisfying. I logged in and undocked in a helios to see if there were any good local sites to run. I probed the signature in my home system down and found it was a 3/10 plex. That's a great start to the day - maybe get my day going with an A-type hardener or something.
---
I jump in my hawk and enter the site - Fuck. Wrecks. I immediately open up the context menu to warp back to station when my two little brain cells rub together and I realize that whoever is running this site is not done with it. I pop the afterburner and hurry on into the site. D-scan tells me that it's a Gila running the site.
---
I jump into each room - all wrecks. Finally, I get to the second-to-last room, and there's the Gila, sitting on gate, with just one rat left. I punch it straight to the acceleration gate. The fool chose to retract his drones once the last rat was dead, instead of leaving them behind.
---
Thus, I get to the final room first. I pick out the faction rat, headshot it, and afterburn in to grab the loot (using my assault damage control, as the entire room is now shooting me). I quickly loot and warp out. 
---
Fuckin A-Type Small Shield Booster. One of the best drops. Nice!!

I run electricals and gammas in a 220 fit vagabond for days. Its easy-mode. Go RF gyros and drop damaviks in a couple seconds thanks to amazing tracking, and ignore neut ships entirely in the electricals.

why? He is the content everyone wants

I always scale it by isk vs reward (PvP). Like sure, I'm not going to stick a 50 mil faction damage mod on my Merlin, but if I'm flying a 400mil HAC, then the additional cost is marginal relative to the hull provided that the module make enough of a damage increase to be worthwhile.

since coalitions are not well defined and there can be coalitions within coalitions (and in between) the entire attempt at making a coalition list with any detail is a waste of time. There are fewer words more fitting to this game than a waste of time however so i'll bite.
---
&gt;galministan
---
wangs in not in galmil anymore and was actively hostile to fedup so I don't think they'd be part of it anymore.
---
&gt; Tri-wagon
---
i'm not really sure what that is supposed to be? skeleton crew are direct ncpl allies. If anything is going to be a coalition of the nu-pb it would be weekend warriors + tri + combat wombat + gone fission + conifers (maybe novac and fweddit too but they don't really dwell in the area). With the "pure blind madness" of banderlogs, oldschool, fxr and anarchy.
---
&gt; Holy rental empire
---
why are you keeping the renters of skillu and hard knocks with skillu and hard knocks in the same coalition and not in a separate "associates" tab as you did with all other renters?
---
&gt;northern pandemic
---
how hard can it be to not come up with new names, just call it panfam dude. Also might be good to separate all renters under their respective "owner" alliances, and I say this for all of them not just panfam.
---
You're probably also missing the etherium reach(?) dudes with unspoken et al but hell if I know
---
Again hope use enjoy and thanks for your time.
---
This is one of those guys that you expect to eventually invoke Texas Law in his defense.
---
Just because it's happening on the server already, does not make it okay. Obviously no one has any ability to stop them from doing the no no things on tranquility (besides CCP), but it's proven that PIBC will commit to those things at a coalition level. The original point of my post was to simply say, "Please play fair." and that's it. To my knowledge, allegedly, PIBC did the no no things without impunity and spared no cost. This was probably the entire serenity server more than likely, but none the less PIBC was one of them.
---
There is no answer to fix the n+1 problem that Eve Online has. That is something we players will have to adapt to.

Is a Customs Officer a higher rank than Night Manager? If so, you're fired.
---
/u/querns_gsf i'll give you $3.50 to put this man on the Imperium voting bloc.
---
I believe you watched it happen. You're still retarded.
---
Yes, this article was very well done. Having its own reddit post is waranted, IMO.
---
To me, it demonstrates yet again that wormholers who think they have impervious setups in their home hole are specifically targeted.
---
they had deals on rorquals and structures though, so its still a reset, just not talking about the standings
---
My favorite part of this BR: Coalition Hispana
---
Scenario 1: I solo jump my assault frigate into Hispana sov, I am responded to with a 15 man gatecamp including hics, orthruses, and a cyno with carriers and dreads behind it
---
Scenario 2: An iHUB belonging to their allies is under attack and a major brawl is likely, they answer the call with: two machs and 5 caracals.
---
Stay free, idiots!
---
I wouldn't say unviable, just not impervious/invulnerable. If they had safed their assets in logged off freighters the losses would have been but a fraction of what they were.
---
If only 5% of viewers are subscribers and donators and a streamer wins 50%+ of the time, that's pretty suspect.
---
I see a lot of streamers doing pay-to-play giveaways even after people having told them it's illegal, though. I'm not sure Twitch enforces it.

Can you post the fit?

What's the expected lifespan of your ship? I have a scanning Loki that, based on reports from my corp-mates, I should expect to survive for years provided I don't do anything particularly stupid with it like jump into a lowsec gatecamp. For highsec mining ships, your life expectancy is directly tied to the bling on your ship, so it will never be appropriate to fit anything "absurdly priced".
---
Then again, if you're confident enough that you can get a full month of mining unganked with the blingiest of bling, the extra boost starts to add up pretty quickly. You'd have to do the math, but I'm betting it's not worthwhile to go above T2 mining anywhere in highsec.
---
Photons as particles is a hate fact against minmatar culture.
---
You got a UK license for those facts mate?
---
I've seen people use a Kiki, but keep in mind that spool time will keep your clear speed much lower than your maximum paper DPS.
---
A few weeks ago, 3 years anniversary of my corp, we organised a meme roam with ahead-of-the-meta fits. We choose to go to brave staging without knowing if we would be able to kill something with these meme fits but still, we warped on V-3 gate and opened a bubble. A stratios jumps in and try to cloak but somehow freaks out and gets locked by our mighty tacklers, we slowly grinded him -&gt;  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75964668/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75964668/)   
---
We looted something like 1.2bil, we could have been luckier on the drop but that kill made our evening!
---
Can you tell us more about the sticky situations you had to bribe your way out of?
---
Bit of extra DPS. Nothing else really goes there, so why not? Getting capped out is almost impossible so a nos doesn't make much sense, which is basically the only other reasonable option.
---
Won't do anything to frigates though, don't even bother.
---
Something something, CONCORD umbrella.
---
Thanks Sherlock Holmes
---
basically the only time i do giveaways is when i'm doing a charity drive, and i'll do the 2nd option for when i hit a certain benchmark. The best way to be transparent is by pulling up the giveaway bot on screen and showing it that way. 
---
In general I try to stay away from doing giveaways as a gimmick, because I'd rather have people that are there to watch the content. I think there are plenty of people who have done giveaways effectively, but the best example i can come up with is JEFFRAIDER, who literally would just throw ships out regardless of any kind of cash being thrown at him. 
---
I dunno, I feel like doing giveaways in general sets you up for failure, because eventually you run out of shit to give out, and you'll become more focused on getting shit to hand out than on creating good content.  But that's just like, my opinion, man.
---
none of these are fine in reality
---
The bottom one SHOULD be "entertainment and content"   
---
People pay the streamer RL money, and get entertainment.
---
Maybe the problem is that the newbies don't know that they have that extra security in those starter sysrems? I know the game doesn't teach that to them...
---
Which died about halfway in. Dunno maybe he reshipped or people started calling the wrong name.
---
Apparently doing an instrumental core resevoir. I have no gas harvesting experience at all. How is he tanking heavy sleeper fire like that?
---
Won't work. That video is old (lol suitcase). The NPC's in the Vast, Vital, and Instrumental neut for 24,60,and 72 respectively. Personally tried a 10mn fit in an Instrumental, the neuts will turn off everything as soon as they lock. They also have webs, so no, not feasible.

Its pretty funny imo, i may have to do this to a corpie at some point haha
---
They called the wrong name. I got killed fairly early and saw this boosh from an on grid structure. Unless the machs got booshed off, burned back, then got booshed off again, it was Virion. Again, gf.
---
I wish they'd add a dreadnought level abyssal where you get mutes that affect capital mods.
---
We don’t really need more powercreep for capital vessels. First they should add Battleship-class Abyssal sites, to finally give them a use outside of nullsec DED sites and Incursions for some faction battleships.
---
Just stop posting
---
LPT: [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a wonderful (and free and easy to use) service.
---
I know we're talking about TOS violations but I don't believe it's legal to run the second one without adherence to sweepstakes regulations. Otherwise you are essentially running an unregulated and illegal giveaway.
---
I was doing Proving Grounds in an Orthrus not too long ago and I came up against another guy in an Orthrus. I ended up winning and our fits were similar, but he had 3 Abyssal rolled BCS and two of them dropped! One of the two BCS was worth around a billion ISK.
---
Issue I find with the Breacher is its engagability is really low. 
---
Makes finding fights a pain, guess you had same issue as most the video was you and Lasker. 🤣
---
That Maulus was very interesting though.
---
A question: 
---
* I undock in a JF/Carrier/Super and someone targetlocks me. Can i still jump to my cyno? Can i still do the latter if he also starts to shoot me?
---
Man in my country it takes years to get on the list if you're lucky enough to pass the screening, and then you can only do it for one family. So instead I donate blood for sandwiches, orange juice, and snickers, and barter them with hobo's for cents. Then I buy ISK from a Russ at the pub.
---
20bil in a year?
---
You'd make more VNI ratting.
---
 WOW calling highsec hard we're reaching new levels of pathetic in the year 2019
---
On a phone at work right now, but the gist is simple.
---
Highs: 
---
5x 220mm T2 autos w/ rf emp
---
1x T2 HAM w/ CN mjolnir 
---
Mids:
---
Pith X LSB 
---
T2 invuln
---
Corelum C-type 10mn AB 
---
Thukker large cap battery
---
Lows:
---
3x RF gyros
---
2x T2 TEs
---
Rigs:
---
T2 burst aerator
---
Cap control circuit 
---
Dont skimp on the cap battery or LSB. The CCC is only needed for non electricals. Your cap stability is 75% with everything running. The 115m sig means you dont need to permarun the LSB if you dont want to. Tank is 520dps cold. You can get a ridiculous number with pills and implants. 
---
Ill be using this fit for T5s soon as well. My only worry is the DPS wall of the kitey  drifter BS, but so far, on SiSi, I have yet to have issues.
---
Each of these scenarios should be against both CCP and Twitch's agreements.
---
It doesn't matter how the viewer is compensated. The only thing that matters is that at the end of the day, the streamer is receiving donations for an implied isk reward to one or more viewers in kind.
---
The definition of RMT is converting in-game assets into real life assets.
---
If the streamers were truly interested in just building their stream as opposed to directly enriching themselves, then the giveaway paradigm would still function under non-monetary principles, or ones which are not open ended, for example, tying giveaways to SUBS ONLY, or a certain Tier of sub maintains the allure of the giveaway while establishing a finite financial cap tied to the popularity of the stream, since you can only sub once per month (if people want to make smurf accounts, more power to them)
---
These types of streams, ALL OF THEM, yes, even the very popular and well regarded ones (I will not name names) are bad for the soul of this game and in my opinion are directly HARMING the image of EVE Online. CCP should be embarrassed and shamed that they allow some of these streamers on their official channel.
---
EVE is a shitty stream game. I'm sorry to say it, as someone who loves both EVE and Twitch. There's nothing you can do about this. And it's a sad state where basically the only EVE streams which pull real numbers are nothing but thinly veiled slot machines. CCP should end this. If they want EVE to have a stream presence, they should be providing gameplay options that lead to high quality live content. Abyssals \*sort of\* achieve that in their own lame ass way, but there's work to do on the PVP side as well.
---
Gemini are renters, not associated with us. and thank you u/protostar71 :)
---
KK thanks! Thanks for everything. So I guess we'll have to do the gas for 14 minutes then run like hell thing. Uhmm they do still only pop up after 15 minutes right? I seem to remember that being said somewhere although like I said, I've never went huffing myself.
---

---
Are Hulks still in game?
---
They are the typical “we are helping” alliance
---
lol useless
---
step number 1. stop crying about it. step number 2 report botters. step number 3 work hard and you will overcome. dont stand around pointing fingers at a group of people who want to enjoy this game with you, when a good portion of them just want to have good fights and assimilate. gold selling will always be an issue but have some honor and fight for you space without being a cry baby about it.

Popped out a wormhole into null sec, was scanning to see if anything good was about. This was in the time of poses, so I usually just checked for a force field, Corp hangar, ship maintenance array, and the control stick.
---
Slap dscan. Control tower, sma, cha. Wait, am I reading that right? Slap dscan again. Control tower, sma, cha. Oh. Oh my.
---
Warp to the moon it's anchored at. There's no force field and those structures look mighty undefended. Laid into the sma, nothing. Laid into the cha, 2 loot cans. Better than nothing.
---
They were full of einheirj (or however it's spelled) and a single, fully researched bpo for said fighters.

It was a good day.

I here you lol but really I didn't have to much of a problem finding fights most of them I did not include in the video is due to them being pretty boring that being due to it being so strong.

Twitch usually does enforce it, if you ever saw one of the csgo streamers do thier thing in the golden days of skins gambling etc it would be sub only giveaways etc all the time. Then from one day to the next it pretty much stopped instantly because twitch started raising the banhammer and took out a few people. Odds are that viewerships stats are kinda low (which is pretty common for eve streamers) meaning fuck all reports it as a violation of twitch TOS. As far as i understand the report feature is based on amount of people who report a given streamer.
---
It is by no means okay to do it, but people act like PIBC comes to TQ and invents botting and rmt on the server. And they will never do it on a coalition level on TQ as they will then most likely leave the server faster then they could open a cyno due to ccp.
---
There will allways be the n+1 problem becasue having 200 vs 201 euqually skilled players the 201 will win.

Thats awesome.

who are WHISKY anyways?

This would be a pretty cool integration with GESI since you would be able to use `CalendarApp` from within the script editor.  https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/calendar/calendar#createEvent(String,Date,Date)
---
I.e. Get industry jobs, create event for each.  Ofc would prob need some logic in there so prevent duplicates.  But it would prob be pretty easy imo.
---
idk some nerds

no i mean, really, who are they? like INK v3.0?
---
What the hell is this fit
---
Yes it most definitely can.
---
Brain cells meet their end on all of 1DQ1-A's ingates...
---
risk to what? being shot ingame? that is basically negligible, as they earn so much in the meantime of not being shot. Of course, if they would start ratting with stuff they regularly lose, then ye. but that is why they won't use NSA-carriers anymore.
---
What is your basis on "a bot is free"? On the business side of bots, they would simply make more bots if an additional bot makes them more money. ZERO reason why not to...
---
But VPN, as you said, as well as time to set them up, PCs they are running on etc are costs...
---
Actually, when I'm writing this. I think i got the solution to our bot problem... Make the game eat more CPU (thanks 64bit client), so much that it's basically impossible to play with more than 6 accounts or so... (honestly who does this already, except very few specialists?)
---
So they simply cannot bot with many accounts without the additional/expensive hardware. So we put their cost higher (also they electric bill)
---
origin is recruiting if you breath in ustz
---
Corpie, sure... but how salty one must be to buy and deliver a thousand of ships into a wh just to mess up a stranger's kb a bit? XD

because actively going after 1 member of ccp has worked out so well in the past, hasn't it?

While we're being cheeky in random reddit threads....
---
It's most certainly "not good" that TQ is literally being overrun by a wave of Chinese bots while you people sit around with your thumb in your assess telling us there is nothing you can do, when we all know you're just too lazy, cheap, and stupid to actually address the problem (whose outcome will cost you all your jobs and us the game we love).
---
TL;DR: Don't expect to not get shit on when you do absolutely nothing about a much bigger problem when commenting on something comperitively meaninglessness.
---
Where’s the automod bot when you need it?
---
how is scenario 2 different from somerBLINK?
---
a prospect with 2 mses, recharger, 4 power relays, and purger rigs has like 100 dps tank with em alone, with explosive its almost 200.
---
There is just one requirement to get saved by that standing fleet and its the one thing 90% of dead rorqs in delve forget
---
1 is an obvious no, 2 seems fine as long as the winner really is random, but 3 is a cash in exchange for in-game assets situation so I would think that would fall under RMT rules.
---
was 3/4th afk running a serpentis den in highsec in my geddon and this ishtar trys to steal my site, he kills the overseerer but I loot it, im about to warp off when he long points me, 30 seconds later I was 2 bill richer.
---
Not at all unviable. Assets of AFK players in w-space drop as loot. Assets of players who pay attention get shuffled from citadel to citadel, preventing this sort of loot spew. Spare assets of players who do a little preventative maintenance get shipped out to k-space, also preventing this sort of loot spew. The fact that dozens of Rorquals dropped in that system suggests that dozens of pilots couldn't be bothered to log off in their most valuable ships, nor self-destruct them when things looked grim.
---
Life in a wormhole always has an expiration date. It's a question of how much extra can you make before your system burns. (For my part, I would bet that this was a profitable venture for Aphelion, despite what appear to be some truly astonishing errors at the  end.)
---
Who are you again? lol
---
&gt;step number 1. stop crying about it. step number 2 report botters. step number 3 work hard and you will overcome. 
---
Did you just copy that straight out of the latest self help guide on Amazon?
---
You know what's also "not good"?  
---
Hyperbolic word salad.
---
2003 fit. Even in the comments it says that now they apply webs and neuts so it won't work.
---
There's a couple counters out there especially if the breacher pilot doesn't carry Javelin rockets to extent their engagement capability. Anything that will get out of rocket range will take down the breacher. Just kill the drones 1st if you think they will be a problem.
---
Eh, we can establish a rotation.
---
You're a dumbass.
---
&gt; viable option from the industry comes along, likely star citizen.
---
And you lost all your credibility. That game will seriously never come out as a finished game, it's such a scam. Even if it comes out there's no way we'll get the same type of large-scale combat that we see in EVE, which is a unique thing about this game that a lot of us enjoy.
---
&gt; this game has 1-2 years life expectancy lef
---
Noted, we'll see ;)
---
Yeah my instincts were it was overly optimistic.
---
There it is. We almost had a thread without the current racist gibberish of every other thread on the sub for the last two weeks.
---
Thanks I'll have to Pyfa that..sure wish EFT was still a thing.. I liked that better than Pyfa by light years.
---
What exactly did I say that was "blatantly false?"
---
that fit is just plain special, and how the fuck do you die to diamond rats on a gate?
---
6 whole rorquals? I'm sure their economy is paralyzed
---
&gt; you people sit around with your thumb in your assess telling us there is nothing you can do, when we all know you're just too lazy, cheap, and stupid to actually address the problem
---
So… all of it.
---
&gt; in all my knowledge i was gifted by the lord of light in game design, i make a conclusion, like a doctor does upon a diseased patient, this game has 1-2 years life expectancy left, unless radical changes are made to heal the disease, starting with the above methods of cure.
---
I think I have only 1-2 years left after reading this sickening post.

---
Will upvote for the mustache
---
well us threatened them to cut them off internet and swift banking system for years. so its just ensuring that they are able to exist in case those threats are followed upon.
---
for banking they were initially using chinese system, while they developed their own.
---
Still not seeing anywhere where you pointed out what I said that was "blatantly false."

It’s only gay if you give a reach around tho..

One of my favorite parts of EVE is when another player tries to have non-consensual sex with my face and instead dies to rats.
---
Are you that guy who threw the bitchfit on the official forums after your roleplaying highsec whiteknighy group got ganked by a couple of drekavacs?
---
Maybe stop looking in the mirror long enough to read?
---
seems like willful ignorance if they've been playing since 03 and don't get it to that degree.
---
It's not entirely straightforward, since if you never admit that you're rigging it, then there's no incentive to donate/subscribe. If you rig it so subscribers are more likely to win, but obfuscate that fact sufficient for it not to be banworthy, you're ALSO making it hard for potential subscribers to tell that they should be subbing to increase their chances.
---
A much more likely scenario is that the subscription/donation system is just used to launder preexisting RMT transactions, which is obviously and categorically against the rules.
---
Funny that you tell the story of a bullshit rename and unironically call the CFC imperium.
---
Oh god, how will they ever recover. Now they have to drop the Eagle fleets and switch to Moas for strat ops and ctas
---
Well you know... “You can finish on my face, but don’t tell anyone” 😂😂😂😂

CCP's biggest problem is CCP.
---
There, fixed that for you in one sentence.
---
Risk of getting banned? I know its almost non-existent, but in theory it is there.
---
&gt;What is your basis on "a bot is free"?
---
If you can run one, you can probably run 100.
---
&gt;Actually, when I'm writing this. I think i got the solution to our bot problem... Make the game eat more CPU (thanks 64bit client), so much that it's basically impossible to play with more than 6 accounts or so... (honestly who does this already, except very few specialists?) So they simply cannot bot with many accounts without the additional/expensive hardware. So we put their cost higher (also they electric bill)
---
Actually they can. One of the things that is usually done is to not use the real client. So they create their own client that doesnt have all the graphics. This makes it possible to run maybe 100+ clients per machine.
---
The VPN setup is all going to be automated at this point.
---
I think its around 15-20 minutes yes. Ninja huffing is meh. You can fit a raven to shoot out to 300km to clear the instrumental, takes about 30-40 minutes depending on skills and WH flavour. Gila clears a Vast easily.
---
The camels nose?
---
Its darn beautiful is what it is, i wish someone would give me all that free stuff!
---
Yeah. That's definitely what I was talking about. Although the rest of your post is also pretty dumb. I'm sure you're speaking from your experience in management of a game development company.
---
I don't think banning these actions in game is true to the spirit of the game. 
---
I think the changes to War-Dec mechanics and aggression/neutral alts addressed a lot of the grievances people had with the system. I'd like to see this one play out and see how it does
---
Ganking- This one still needs some tweeking. 
---
1.  Sec status should mean something other than just being able to be shot at by other players.This penalty is easily avoided by flying corvettes and shuttles that you don't care to lose and not flying implants. My suggestion is to make it be combined with standings to determine eligibility to dock in stations. Low sec status can be offset by high standings with a corp(i.e. corps will hide criminals they are on friendly terms with). Citadels/structures have made it possible to have safe harbor if you can't dock in stations. I think that could make for some interesting gameplay like sieging a pirate safe haven.  
---
2. Concord response time should be by default based on a systems security status but can be affected by large amounts of criminal activity in system. More crime = Concord is patrolling for criminals resulting in shorter response time. This could make for some fluidity in movement around systems and not just have the same systems camped 24/7. 
---
\-On a side note this should be implemented in null sec for ore and combat anoms 
---
I think they are some relatively good changes that could break a lot of the stagnation with the gameplay as I see it.
---

I'd say log in and follow the tutorial. You will learn a lot over the first 20 hours. Keep training skills and upgrade to the paid version when/if it makes sense. You won't regret the time spent.

Perhaps you should show us what you actually wrote?
---
*waaaaaah das rayciss*
---
I have many questions to ask this guy but I doubt I'd get good answers. Did he put down a structure before getting to know the area and the players? Also, many people in high sec get war dec ransomed. It's unfair to a degree but it may have been avoidable if he thought before dropping a station. If not, pay the ransom? Plenty of people have and not bitched about it. And wtf was he doing since 03 that he just now decides to drop a structure and get his ass handed to him. I call bs. Tears were delicious.

Funny, I’m in my mid 20s and I’m pretty sure my grand children will end up inheriting star citizen just in time for its release..

You can down vote me all you want but at least I don't harrass our community for my own enjoyment. I'm not a sociopath so my enjoyment doesn't come from causing other people undo stress.

And probably eat some lead for breakfast one of these days.
---
And yet new games still struggle to make mirrors work.
---
I think this is a very optimistic statement to...as far as how much longer they will be in development. Double that is probably closer. lol
---
Without considering every possible frig matchup, I think its safe to say there is more balance than imbalance. The reasonable solution is to nerf the overpowered ones: comet, worm, succ, and garmur. Cruor and GNI need to be redesigned.
---
&gt;the comet is so much fun to fly and it gives alphas/sharp newbies a fantastic platform
---
Yeah, because its overpowered.
---
&gt;but it's not game-breaking and the other navy frigates are very capable of beating comets while being fun in their own right.
---
A frigate cant break the game, but its clearly the best among the faction frigs. It can be beaten by niche fits, but its always very strong and difficult to fight.
---
The title literally says "to get money from your isk", this whole thread is rmt
---
Power creep is exactly what we need.  We need pirate guns and ships that use 3 factions worth of skill points. it's the logical way to buff veterans over injected newbies: make stuff powerful enough that uses so many skill points, that injecting into them is impractical.

I run 5's well with an 800-1b fit depending but only run the shield or cap filaments. My skills are pretty much all maxed though. A lot of it comes to know what to kill first and how to get under guns. When it comes to leshak spawns you just gotta burn in at a slight angle balls to the wall overheat your MWD and take out the renewing first.   
---
Cost has less to do with clearing time (dps) in a Gila than survivability.  The only expensive blingy thing you could add to a Gila are the x ballistic controls that increase drone and missile damage.  What cost really comes down to is the more expensive your fit is (as long as it is a proper fit) the more room you have to screw up or get unlucky without dying. And yea, I notice a decent increase in loot from 3-4 but 5 is where it's at. Keep in mind though, a loss will set you back a long way.

There is something I don't understand about this whole story:
---
So the residents built a "squadron" of capital ships that they had no way of ever exporting. Presumably, the entire reason why they built those caps was to defend their system. 
---
So why didn't they use them to destroy the battleships and structures that the invaders brought in? They left their capitals in the Fortizar to be ejected upon its destruction and then used by the invaders to accelerate the assault?
---
Why build caps in the C1 in the first place if they weren't prepared to actually use them?

You can space lawyer this as much as you want. It's all RMT and they will ban you for it.
---
Oftentimes the people that own those caps/heavy assets are just afg and didn't have the good sense to liquidate or transfer them beforehand. It's dumb, and it happens.
---
About 50% of the destruction of eve's values come from the same 5 corporations 
---
50% of the wars in eve are launched by the same 5 corporations
---
from those wars, there is 105 kills to 1 death for its members
---
4% of the people war dec'd are able to kill 1 ship.
---
82% of eve players are pve focused
---
46% of the population will not do pvp at all if they can

Statistically we do not know, but we can ask

How many players stay in high sec starter corps to avoid war?

How many stations are there to avoid war in alt corps?

how many people left eve due to station camping?

i know chuggi well enough now, and it's mostly because i think he is out of touch with the political landscape for the most part.

Not really, no. There are risks you can mitigate, but the joy of a sandbox game is that there are so many ways to play and many of those ways involve shooting at other people.
---
Happily, it is a game and often you can talk to and learn from people that kill you. The smart ones know that they need to keep people in the game to shoot at so they won't be too jerky.  I actually have gotten some great ship fits and tips from people hunting me.
---
I have been hunted and had fun running and I have been the hunter laughing at how "they shoulda checked local".
---
EVE is so realistic in that the same things that protect you in real life work great here.

2.  Have a plan.

3.  Be a fearless psychotic bastard.😁

And honestly? This is coming from someone that sucks at PVP and loves PVE, this game us predation and paranoia and I love it.😁

Locking and firing weapons doesn't prevent you from jumping, just like they don't prevent you from warping. You can jump to cynos if and only if you can warp - in other words, if you're not tackled by warp disruptors/scrams/bubbles. If you have warp core stability (such as from warp core stabilizer mods or the stability inherent in supers and titans) you can still jump while pointed as long as their point strength doesn't exceed your warp core stability.
---
Hence the new changes to War-Dec mechanics. I'm not sure what point you're trying to make unless you just think they need to make it 100% safe, which I don't agree with
---
My god...
---
Where can I sign up to shoot his structure?
---
Ahem... It's true that the mechanics have changed a great deal since the last time enemies of The Imperium had any teeth. But let's keep it 100, it's not the mechanics that make invading delve difficult. It's the fact that certain groups of people had their war chests sized and wallets zeroed out when CCP banned a certain large scale RMT operation. The same large scale RMT operation that was bankrolling half of the game to kill goons. Except it didn't take did it?  Righhhht... before MBC could deliver the killing blow they deflated like a sad balloon animal.  That must be so frustrating... To be so close to something only to have it ex machinad away from you.
---
I think you are crybaby.
---
Actually, after reading your post second time to reply with arguments and make a fine post, i did really felt you an idiot and it's waste of time.
---
EVE is pvp game first, even in its current state.
---
There should be LESS safety, wardec was fine, now with HQ requivement it's sounds great. It could have some more flavour like warscore, wargoals, fatigue, penalty for not accepting peace if wargoal is achieved or not taking white peace if war went badly for attacker, but those can be easily implemended in future. 
---
Player retention in game like EVE is fine as it is not popular casual game and highsec hugbox is about 1% of that game has to offer, new players leave more due to boredom of highsec. 
---
By the way, considering how old EVE and CCP are, it is hard to believe that CCP is not competent.
---
&gt; Is there ANY situation where these niche modules are actually advisable?
---
To answer your question directly - yes, lots of people use them. Primarily it's either in situations where you don't expect to die (ratting or mining in the safety of a nullsec empire) or you think it's worth the extra edge in PvP. Highsec mining is *not* a place to use them.
---
If I were running an EVE channel, I'd use giveaways to pump up viewership numbers to get people hooked, then provide interesting content to get their subs.  Since I have no meaningful insight or interesting content, I do not run an EVE channel.
---
A quick [search](https://www.eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=WormholeSpace) shows that the c4 sites deal under 500dps and can probably be run in a passive praxis or myrmidon, my fit for a myrm gets up to like 450dps passive (just have LSE IIs in mids, power relays in lows, and purger rigs). C5s you’ll need something bigger, the core reservoirs deal 1800-2300 dps, with lots of neuts, and you’ll need a marauder or a couple rattles/Nestors to tank those sites (comment on the vital core said he was in a rail Kronos and almost died, that dps is no joke)

There’s nothing wrong with that, but the reason I, and probably most of the players here, play for is the risk vs reward that EVE offers. The best thing this game offers is true loss. A death costs you. A mistake costs. You don’t just respawn and fix your armour. Your ship is gone, plain and simple. Without the paranoia and danger this game would be less fun.
---
Sounds like someone got ganked and/or wardecced and doesn’t want someone else to affect their gameplay. Sorry, bud, this is EVE and when you undock you consent to PVP. If that ever changes EVE stops being EVE and will be a bastardization of itself. 
---
If EVE has 1-2 years of life left, perhaps you should go try to find a new game to play now instead of waiting. I suggest No Man’s Sky, Star Citizen, or Elite Dangerous. All offer good space mechanics and offer you that sci-fi feel.
---
Good luck to you, sir. I hope you find what you’re looking for in this universe!

I honestly can't remember, I just remember seeing location a wreck with a few t2 modules and this booster, I didnt need it and checked prices. Needless to say I hightailed it to Jita and pressed sell ASAP
---
I don't think you are following the discussion.
---
Where are you getting these statistics?
---
It's cool..some people pointed out the Jedi Huff videos really old and the sleepers have been buffed to the point where this won't work now so you just have to ninja huff and run before the sleepers or anyone else shows up.
---
I've been away from EVE for probably a good two years now, maybe more. But I happened across a meme earlier this week about bots invading and something about a Chinese alliance. Is this just a running gag, or did something prompt the shutdown/merger of the Chinese server (and have they really been migrating over to Tranquility en masse)?
---
&lt;3
---
You're missing the biggest value.
---
As a new player (assuming you are not injecting) it will take months to build up your skills. Sure, you can do things, but you can do them well (for a while).
---
Then it happens, that skill that's taken weeks to train (BING!), suddenly a new ship type or module is available to you. Maybe you can fly faster now or take more damage. You earned it, you have been waiting on it. 
---
Eve is difficult, but it rewards you for taking the time and making an effort to learn the mechanics.
---
Your mirror is broken. That's not in reverse.
---
I dunno, losing your ship to a completely AFK ratter is pretty funny!

The issue was he was giving EXTRA ISK value if you purchased from his partner, who gave him a kickback. What that means is the EXTRA isk above the value of the plex purchased was RMT.
---
After everyone bitched and complained so much about the last few, the developers may think their player base does not enjoy that feature.
---
Man the original titans are so impractically large. It's hard to imagine one ever being built. Think of the amount of material it would have. A regular titan is 15km long right? How big is one of these things? One interesting thing is that stellar bodies tend to (depending on their composition) go into isostatic equilibrium (rounding into a spheroid) at roughly around 400km in diameter. Imagine building a spaceship so large that you are experiencing gravitational stresses at the ends of the hull.
---
Red (Fire), Blue (Legacy), yellow (Imperium)   
---
Is this grouping friendlies? the only ones you have done that to is PANFAM/GOTG

Now that PANFAM/GOTG have officially broken apart you could give them Blue and yellow and give Imperium/Legacy their colors.
---
Ahh thank you. I never heard of the ban being lifted before.

This cool story brought to you by Bro Inc.
---
My last straw with events was actually Permafrost and before then I got weary of the whole mining in events bullshit with the BPCs. For me that is what is ruining them.
---
Then of course add on top of that Guardian Gala which was a fucking fiasco all around not really an event. 
---
The good thing is, they might have gotten the hint from the feedback they received over Guardian Gala and are actually working on a larger, really cool and actually functional event and new content involving the Triglav.
---
The bad thing is, we don't know how it will turn out. Might be good or might be horrible.

Eve is a game where an action that seems stupidly simple to vets is opaque as all get to a new player. The simplest thing to do in game is mine in a belt in HS. How many sentences does it take to describe how to do that and not get ganked, or killed by rats? That is what this post is about. Not give safe space plz. There is a reason that "what's a Jita?" is laughed at, but it is a really difficult thing to explain to someone who has never really interacted with the market.
---
Oh yeah, definitely the cyno. Tho without both you *may* get saved, as long as you are on coms.
---
I think recent events have demonstrated beyond any doubt that you can put an end to an alliance without showing up to a single citadel fight. But don't let these facts get in the way of your narrative. You do you.
---
I mean lets do this.  Because why not.
---
Last year was gura hiva for easter. The npcs were actually difficult to farm with scan down sites, escalations and timelimits for the sites. Clearly you know what you are talking about.

Also let's be honest, what regulatory body is gonna go after a video game giveaway that involves the equivalent of like $100 changing hands monthly (at most)

Great question. That is information I don’t have. Somebody should determine what the mass density is.

Most kind. Saves me looking in the morning heh (if I remembered).
---
D3vil's Childr3n is recuriting if you give up your rorquals

If in-game assets are used in giveaways to promote popularity of a stream or video, there must be full parity between users who are viewing the content for free and those who are subscribed, and all viewers of content must have the same access to giveaways and the same chance to win prizes regardless of any subscription fees paid.
---
I would interpret that to imply getting entry to a contest or giveaway because you paid a direct tip is against the  ""there must be full parity between users who are viewing the content for free and those who are subscribed, and all viewers of content must have the same access to giveaways and the same chance to win prizes regardless of any subscription fees paid.""

Yup :P The Empires have actually banned them from being used within the gravity well of inhabited worlds due to the danger of harming the populace. 
---
They're also so expensive to produce that most Empires don't have more than two or three, and CONCORD had to intervene and limit their production as attempting to keep up was bankrupting the Minmatar Republic (in it's earliest days).

Regular plain HS L4s give you more then this, and by default if you do them in a cruiser you can also do up to DED 5/10s and T3 Abyss with same cruiser skills. Bling some once you can and bump your Abyss to T4s and DED sites to 6/10s. Sidetrain to T3C or cov ops and go on WH daytrips. Then you can also do burner missions as pointed out already.
---
I'm assuming you are in a bad spot in NS, where you're stuck using a VNI cause using anything better would just mean a ship loss. Leave it. Seriously, talk to your corp mates and see what you all come up with, if nothing, leave them. Being stuck in VNI ratting is a horrible existance.

I expect the isostatic equilibrium point is a function of the strength of electron bonds in materials, which are variable to some limit.  And of course the internal structure, i.e. the mass of material in a ship hull is far less than the equivalent volume of rocky material.

Yeah that's correct, you're talking about a solid 400km object, not one with a lot of empty hull volume, but imagine applying a thrust sufficient to turn one of these titans on one end of a structure this large and the kind of stresses that would place on the entire hull? If they existed I imagine they could barely move. Since, I think, stargates don't actually move an object I can just kind of picture one that is more or less tethered to using stargates.

Remember the last time you saw a pager and were like 'oh shit I totally forgot that existed'

That’s the exact reason I have like 10 solo kills out of 500ish, one is the FW problem that you mentioned along with the rest of them and there’s hardly anywhere that you can practice solo pvp as a new player, other than that it’s just gang bullshit.. I honestly don’t feel any accomplishment from getting group kills.
---
You mean the spinning Gurista dreadnought?  I liked that it made capitals viable, but the reward for a capital level site wasn't worth it.
---
They are all fine just not amazing.
---
For the average high sec dude it's a great event each time
---
A few things.
---
1) This is a _lot_ of words to ask for suicide ganking to be removed.
---
2) If you think Hilmar is the key to making this happen, or that he is the thing holding it back, I don't think you fully understand the situation. 
---
3) EVE Online is a game about threat: Its projection, mitigation, and compensation. A lot of activities in EVE have no inherent threat to it. Without suicide ganking, effectively the only thing stopping many industrial or explorational pursuits is the capacity of the equipment. This does not lead to good gameplay. 
---
Let's look at mining for example. Without threat, the only consideration is the raw yield, with a secondary consideration of holds. There would be no options to weigh, there would be only one fit, and the activity would be pretty well optimized. 
---
With the additional threat that other players, with enough cost and will, can project their force changes everything. Many people will mine and haul for days and weeks without any problem, others won't. The issues that come from this are emergent. If a place is more dangerous it is because other players are making it more dangerous, not some variable in the code. This makes it naturally dinamic. 
---
The threat and availability of suicide ganking make the gameplay of avoiding it worth it. No matter what someone else does, you always have a way of disrupting or even capitalize on it, if you understand well enough. 
---
So this is why you are getting so much negative feedback. Saying that EVE would be better without suicide ganking is akin to saying that games like WoW would be better with 0 trash in any dungeon, and the honest truth is it simply isn't. 
---
Certainly, there are parts of the way things work that should be looked at, and thankfully they are. However, suicide ganking as a whole isn't going anywhere, just as much as the concept of permanent loss isn't. It isn't some side feature, it is core to the way EVE works as a game.
---
Wait I was thinking about the drifter one.

They didn’t fight. There was big thing about it. It was even the main topic on the meta show. I guess you missed it.
---

---
Bringing back Plex Sliding won't change anything, neither CCP could "fix" PvP
---
It's just the nature of the game, EVE has been around for 15 years, there are lot of really old players only care about their KB
---
For a brand n ew player it is.
---
As far as I can tell, neither. The dominant Chinese server alliance is migrating to Tranquility, but I haven't heard about anything specific prompting them to do so. The meme you saw is a response to their announcement. There have been a number of responses, of a variety of levels of acceptability.
---

I for myself enjoyed looting booster bpcs and mining event ore with abysmal refining yield to build accelerators...

I wasn't the one who made the case for citadels being a hard stop to invasion. You did. Now that IS embarrassing because without any effort on my part you refuted the central premise of your own argument in 2 posts only an hour apart.  Yikes...

People sure do get all fired up about pie charts, this must be some sort of math subreddit.
---
Some art dude at CCP a decade ago must got really drunk and didn't expect to really put this thing in to the game(yeah Soltueur was once actually in game but not this ridiculously big)
---
Well, maybe if they made events similar to the ones that weren't shit instead of trying to outdo themselves on lack of quality/QA every time, maybe people would appreciate them more.
---
Fucking dope.
---
EVE 2 when
---
TBH the accumulated assets in this game has grew so ridiculously large that there is barely a incentive for players to play the game
---
The last one is easily translatable into RMT lol. Wut
---
Pretty much this, last couple events proved they were a testbed for lootboxes.   When it was made clear players won't put up with that shit, Papa PA didn't see them as worth the dev time sans-lootboxes.
---
Nope
---
It may have been low or null.  I couldn't tell ya exactly where though.  It was awhile ago and was when I was living in WH space so I didn't farm the same area all the time.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

That's a Gallente ship, the Hull is definitely not empty. They use a real man's tank.

---

---
How would this differ from the in-game searcher, though?
---
Have you removed their roles?
---
I predict much hate,  but they need to get good. Eve is famous for its learning curve and low survival rate. You make it or dont.
---
Damn someone used it before me XD
---
Yup you just make a close off grid perch, drop extra bombs there in a can (Takes about 20 for an instrumental). Instrumentals are easier than vitals, you just warp from your perch to the site BM at 30 launch bomb then cloak, wait for DMG then warp out. The sleepers don't regen when you are off grid so you are not dealing with that. Before you start you will want to warp in piloting a capsule at 30 to make sure the clouds will not prevent you from cloaking.
---
Vitals are a bit more complicated so send me a PM if you want a breakdown. Hound with all cargo expanders is best and takes about 20 mins with 2 bombing chars at level 4 bomb launch. IT is almost completely safe from PVP and can be cleared in as little as 5-7 minutes in a C5-C6 red Giant.

lol carebear lobbies to kill EVE, players fight him in game, carebear cries harassment. 
---
Controversial opinion: I believe that carebears who refuse to play EVE by shunning PvP should be given the option of renouncing their capsuleer status and gaining PvP immunity, but be forever limited to toiling planetside for the standard civilian wage of 1 ISK per year.

Literally everything was wrong with it, showing corps unrelated to the search terms, not showing anything at all, not even being able to open up Corp ads..
---
Flying through hostile space in a cheetah (Y-2 when TEST owned it), finding an officer and telling the locals.  
---
They apparently didn't believe me so I proceeded to poke some corpies that flew over and we proceeded to kill it with about 35 reds in local.

I agree, also since people can put whatever they want in those ads, there is a lot of false stuff in them

Player count on TQ has been steady since early 2015.

Congratz, your entire argument is invalidated by simple facts.
---
well then you're either trying to push a narrative right now or you're pretty bad at your "job". (btw noone who works in anything intelligence related in the imperium would brag about it like that on reddit, but nice try)
---
Fyi, on your front page, you have "show me cooperations" rather than "corporations"
---
but cool looking site.
---
We liked the old events just fine. The newer stuff has been too elaborate/complicated to get the rewards.
---
Hese things are special events, why mot make it easy farming that creates pvp opportunities?
---
Jove tech

Before reporting the bug, please verify that it actually is a bug instead of you just misunderstanding the mechanics. You cannot kick a member who is logged in and undocked. You can send him to the kick queue (which you can view in the corporation window) and he'll get removed at downtime automatically. If the member is docked, you can instantly remove them.
---
fixed, thank you!
---
3 weeks.
---
He should go back to Farmville. Less chance of getting ganked.
---
My man I appreciate your work, by the way I tried adding a Corp but unfortunately the search engine doesn’t seem to be working, my Corp or if there’s any at all don’t seem to be showing up..
---
We've got 1-day old toons injecting into titans, there's nothing short of making a ship that actually requires every skill in the game at 5 that won't be injected into instantly by spodbrains.
---
no only local reps

I am holding onto tinfoil hat hope that the Triglavian Dreadnought gets debuted in an event of it vs. the highsec empires, and they have to bust out their Iapetans to fight it.
---
Elo led 5 huge barwls in 24h, all winned! Even killed the ihub of TS capital system. 
---
He is cool, awesome, amazing, great, unbelievable, charming and so on and on. I can't praise him more until I learn more beautiful words in English. 
---
By the way,  He even could tell cold jokes in Chinese.
---
Probably forgot that Guristas structures don't shoot EM torpedoes anymore.

30 jump orca escort gone bad after 4 jumps
---
Dude wants to talk about injectors and p2w where his alliance is being attacked by either RMT or just rich people shitting cash for lols.
---
Nobody addresses that and everyone goes for the easy bait instead.  Sad day for eve.
---
theres diplomatic relations and theres diplomatic relations not everyone is supposed to know about (some of them more, some less obvious). if you say its your job to know about both of them then the answer to your question is: you did. if it's not then you either misunderstood my other comment or just horribly failed at trying to sound important in your answer to it.
---
It thought it was a barrel bomb. LOL
---
Only one thing is safe - sitting, docked in an out of the way high sec station. The second you undock, consider a large target painted on your hull.
---
You'll probably be OK 99.99% of the time, but you will eventually get blasted to ash. If you assume it'll happen, you're less pissed when it does. I lost my original blockade runner a while back. I was sad, but ultimately, I undocked it. From that moment I considered it dead, same as I do for any undocked ship.
---
So they have this tech and decided to be whiteknights and keep the empires from getting too crazy but have no interest in making their own empire?
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76275372/ here is the fit if you are curious.
---
Well concord was created by all the empires, but is independent from any one. The jove gave them the tech because of their position, so the causality there isn't quite right. I could be wrong on specifics BTW not an expert
---
Sorry, but you can't kick your NC./PL subordinates that are actively losing their supers/titans until after they are podded/docked.
---
My tactic is to make it look like all I left were the shitty cans then kill the guy taking the shitty cans.
---
That might be but still not as sad as this dudes' corp.
---
SOMER was quite different.
---
Why not sell the injecors/plex and skin in game (skins probably not worth much).
---
They saw what you had when they scouted you then formed equal numbers to have honobru combat sans wormhole bushido guidelines. If you like this style of more competitive pvp you should look into joining a wormhole corp. 
---
The bigger entities will blob in wh space but he smaller groups like to test their metal in more honorable fights that get the blood pumping and adrenalin going.
---
According to the lore, the original titans caused earthquakes and tital waves from the gravitational forces.
