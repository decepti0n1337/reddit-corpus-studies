wow nice leak bro!

Yes, I don't really disagree with kicking someone from fleet for disregarding the FC or denying an order. I think it is a bad idea to force that issue over something that is so small. Certainly, he could have stayed in fleet if he had acquiesced, but I suspect he felt bullied / violated and decided his integrity as an individual was more important. I mean, what if the guy had been kicked for having a ship named "LGBT"? Would you think that was a bad idea?

The Gila still retains its tank, damage output, and ample drone bay. It'll just have a pronounced weakness in drone durability, but it's still going to be crazy strong in other traits. 
---
Disappointing. When THE BASTION announced this move i was most excited. Sure, they have shit thrown at them from time to time who don't understand how the IMPERIUM works, but this was their big chance to show the EVE ONLINE world what they are capable of. I hope that they get out in those rorquals and super carriers and show the bad guys that they are not afraid and they own fountain. Best of luck to the boys of THE BASTION, from PROVIDENCE.
---
I only ever lost implant sets in low by being lazy and/or stupid
---
I really thought the VNI drone velocity nerf was a bit much, they should consider keeping it but at half or maybe a quarter of the original bonus.
---
I don't think the fax taper off starts early enough personally. You don't need 15 faxes to save something except from a dread bomb. Might be better to taper off at 5 or 10.

Well, you're not wrong, tracking needs reducing as well.
---
Imagine u/StainGuy's brain randomly saying "gate" instead of "door" while having casual conversations
---
Sorry small fey they pnly care about goons. Time to lose them rorqs ;)
---
Sure it does. Never seen a super rat in a c5?
---
We said it would hurt those people more but they no listen.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in oldsch00l, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on tri, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in sov warfare and I'm the top entosiser in the entire pure blind madness. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this constellation, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of locator agents across YS-GOP and your location is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your sov. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my lachesis. Not only am I extensively trained in getting booshed, but I have access to the entire arsenal of banderlogs and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the region, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
---
Maybe a good few hours to deliberate on the changes, but those changes can be put in by the end of the workday.
---
I figured you would have sold it in February after the summit. But I guess its smart to keep using it until just before the rest of EVE hears the changes.
---
Them: I'd love to go to Iceland some day.
---
Me: Oh you'd love it. I've been five times.
---
Them: Five times?? Why?
---
Me: Perhaps you should sit down...
---
Would actually make the cynabal insane though wouldn't it
---
i think you should group up in a corporation and find interests that way
---
Use a t1 bs

I’ll do it for three fiddy

weebface mcweebface

Good job CCP, after two years spent on planning, saving isk on mct for honestly training (not a single injector used) my rorq pilot and my reprocessing and industrial toon you broke everything just a few months after I reached my dream.
---
And you did that thinking it will fix the only real problem created by yourself: injectors. 
---
Thank you, you gave me a huge push towards winning Eve.

I guess it’s time to buy some more plex as well, need to refill my wallet..

---
5th race? \*TinFoil Engages  
---
3 houses to pick from  (just as other races)   
---
more ships seem to be coming to fill out the full line of ships... 
---
#GetReadyToHate... but this is good for Eve.
---
High prices means that the real $/isk through plex is lower. At this price it is slightly less than $10/bil. This means that the bots and RMTers have to sell their isk at even lower and less profitable prices.  I doubt PLEX will ever reach real RMT levels ( I am guessing right now its around $5/bil.) 
---
The closer price competitiveness creates more of an incentive for players to support CCP directly over RMTers. You pay a premium to not get banned. That premium lowers as PLEX prices rise. That's good for Eve.
---
I agree that it sucks that people have to grind more to earn play time. I will fully admit am totally a wallet warrior. I just hope people find the best way to make isk (WH space is great!) without getting burned out. It's a balancing act between PLEX prices crushing RMTers and players not getting burned out. I don't want to be CCP trying to find it.
---
I mine ice, so about a week of ice mining should cover it.

I absent mindedly forgot i was flying through null the other day and hit d-scan out of habit.   Nearly had a heart attack.

lol

PLEASE

haha true

fuck man kspace in general is scary.  highsec is nightmare inducing.

I'm talking about ratting in a Hel...

Part of why the game is in such a bad state, they can do one good thing every 2-3 years and everyone instantly forgets about the years of shit that led to those problems in the first place, and the cycle repeats.

Minor tweak: colapses all available wormholes in that system for 24 hours, including any static.
---
I'm a noobie Alpha with barely 1.6 million skill points. WH-space is a blast. As an Alpha without cloaking and limited ship options high-sec will generally have to wait. But WHs lets me get into places without needing to crash gate camps. I was two deep in WH-space yesterday when someone tried to take me out. They webbed me and I still out ran the drones headed my way. Then on the way back somebody living in the system I passed through tried hunt me out with combat scanners. So just for fun I created 3 safe spots in a triangle and ran in circles to give their combat scanners schizophrenia while remaining visible in local. As a low skilled Alpha trying to have fun like that around gate camps is certain suicide.
---
Wait a second here are some skills wbich are not seeded. How would precursors change?
---
use haw titan to run lvl4 in lowsec/null. theres couple missions that allow titans
---
&gt; I figured you would have sold it in February after the summit
---
  TIL I have direct knowledge of what happens in the CSM, even though TEST doesn't have a rep, and I'm not in the CSM.
---
looking at the cruiser graph honestly, you won't notice it until you up to like 30/40 logistics cruisers and at that point, it's an alpha game anyway, it means the loser might be able to take a couple more dudes down. something that honestly isn't bad as it encourages people to fight more when the numbers are not on there side because the might win the isk war.
---
Tweak: titan deaths deal boson damage to all ships within a 10km radius.
---
No, I have not because the only way it could is well with an exploit, as there is no legit way to move a super into a c5 ;). 
---
my wormhole is  bit off genesis - atm nrear lonetrek.  i could help with devoter,this bastard will run whole 4/10 solo with  toe in mouth.   i stopped doing ded 4/10 in gilas stratios ishtars because people were baiting for fight,after taking the hic into play  nobody stole from me single site. 
---
ask in eve-scout/signal cartel or eve-university they will help you
---
I'm thrilled about these changes, and hope CCP doesn't cave on the NSA change.
---
The tears in Delve have been delicious today, though I feel slightly guilty for laughing at my butthurt corp-mates
---
Minor tweak; t3c nullification sub now allows for interdiction sphere launcher to be fitted and used. (Even with covops cloak)
---
Minor tweak; it brings resists down to 0, like polarized guns do.
---
What's wrong with the ishtar and gila?
---
thx
---
thnks u,ur da goodie
---
Just because someone kicks their pet once in a while doesnt mean they cant give them treats.
---
I would say cut it's capability in half, but not disable warp tho...
---
With there being more skillbooks than ever, why are all of these changes to increase price and not decreasing any?
---
i tried now in eve-u channel, ppl are offering to help with a destroyer ^^

If you have nothing better to do, i  can wait for you.

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
actually nevermind, apparently someone else ran it already. Damn, ppl are fast.
---
The whaling loot is barely enough to reward a few hunters, FC, and fuel costs for bridging 100 people around.
---
There's a possibility that this is a variation of the lore that we're already familiar with, developed in some isolation from the rest of the cluster.  
---
*Initially, the Early Slavs believed in only one Vyraj...it was apparently located far away beyond the sea, at the end of the Milky Way. It was often imagined as a garden beyond an iron gate that barred the living from entering, located in the crown of the cosmic tree.*
---
The iron gate referenced in the historical legends may correlate to the EVE Gate.  We call it New Eden, they call it Vyraj.  We're both essentially referring to it as paradise.
---
"The Ancient Domains beyond the Flow of Vyraj are lost to us. Intruders in the Ancient Domains (???) are closed."
---
Ancient Domains = Human civilizations on the other side of the EVE Gate?
---
The split in Vyraj into two realms may be the creation of the Talocan: Abyssal vs. Non-Absyssal.  K-Space vs. J-Space may not even make a difference as far as this is concerned.  Abyssal space may well be a completely separate dimension.
---
Asset safety

some sleep would be a decent idea if not a markov chain post
---
Sorry that ez kills aren't delivered to your lap Capqu.
---
Oh really. I heard Delve is full of PvE bombers.
---
Except for this time I catch him in the very next Proving Conduit and the blood flows :) https://zkillboard.com/kill/75670953
---
We'll have to see how much the application nerf to fighters really hurts the krabs, cause you know they'll be the ones screaming the loudest.
---
Yeah it already had weak drones. You already couldn't bring gilas against prepared enemies and now it's even more so. 
---
thanks for the fight! 
---
To be honest, I'm pretty much over the idea of new T3 ships. Both atempts at them have been riddled with balance issues.
---
Insurance change was dumb imo. If you want to fix faucets, nerf pve. If you want to fix capital overuse, nerf caps.
---
If anything, it seems like what everyone probably actually wants (more capital deaths) is marginally less likely with lower insurance payouts.
---
Personally, I would like to see nullsec local changed to be like wh local.
---
&gt; ve who goes on a quest to find an Elite Bots, but first must overcome a rabbit version of Olmeca. Olmeca teams up wit
---
The overall roaming speed is still reduced and its pretty important. Oftentimes that afk dude is 3 jumps away and you reaching to its drones 10 seconds later makes a big difference. And there are detail issues with why its better to have hyperspatials on the ones with the cargo as well.
---
Drone volume doesn't nerf you if you are a Rorqual in Delve. You shouldn't die in Delve as a Rorq anyway, for wetu to become critical.
---
Great fight, more like that please.
---
Cash funds more tears.
---
Move up and use an ishtar all my 10 accounts has change to ishtars 😊 
---
Then you sacrifice the ability to warp under 4 seconds (inertials). That's even more critical than warp speed, but I won't go into details why.
---
OP is one of today's lucky 10,000
---
Counter-point (this is conjecture but I think it's probably true): People who put the most time into this game (content creators, the dudes responsible for leading fleets &amp; wars) probably have so much free time because they arent working full time. These people would be more hurt by Plex changes than anyone.
---
Yeah its killing me lol
---
If you knew anything about me you'd know I made pretty solid income before booshing.
---
Never had a titan, never will. No, that's just EVE's birthday that year.
---
Ramming damage implants.
---
Oh I like that interpretation. It started out as just the one New Eden, then was split. But then what is Abyssal space? There are 3 dimensions here, and Vyraj has 2 parts. Could New Eden be the original, then Abyssal and W space were created to be the new Vyraj and the Talocans left K space at that point? But then if Abyssal space was made the same as W space why does it work completely differently? The more I think about this the more questions I have.
---
Literally every ship is meaningless and nothing in the game is real
---
Trust in CCP restored 
---
The amount of salt in this thread lets me know that this change is a good thing.
---
Fuck, I did this too.
---
Did you miss the fighter nerf on purpose?
---
the gila is definitely not fine as it is. 500% tank bonus means the gila's 10 drones have the equivalent HP of 60 unbonused medium drones.
---
meanwhile the worm's 5 drones have the equivalent tank of 20 unbonused lights and the rattle's 7 heavies have the tank of 26 unbonused heavies. the gila is way out of line with 60 effective drones to chew through.
---
Can't kill rorqs, they too powerful. Nerfs coming to address the incessant whining. 
---
*But the rorqs still die anyway*
---
Is a rorquals not more than 1km across?
---
Change: The Capital Tractor Beam can now be used on ships.
---
Loosen the tin foil hate buddy
---
Sorry fanboi - I never flew Falcons. 
---
But I guess people who liked flying Falcons did get a bit salty. After spending money on omega accounts to train skills only to have the money wasted when CCP moved the goal posts likely did make them upset. 
---
That said - Falcon pilot salt couldn't be as tasty as the tears of the babies who cried to CCP until ECM was made useless. 
---
imagine sacrificing a 9bil isk JF to bomb drop on a supercarrier
---
Imagine being this socially autisic
---
I'm thinking that W-Space and K-Space are the same thing, just different regions connected by wormholes.
---
Triglavians confirmed space gopniks...
---
it's in the design of their ships! how have we been so blind! Three prongs, three stripes...
---
Why not just pay for the sub and be done with it?  I think a lot of players burn out this way. Have to pve in order to play, but pve is so shit they burn out. 
---
There is zero recourse for this, all you can do is try to appeal to Chribba. Mod hierarchy is everything.
---
I remember giving it a shot on and off a few years ago but a couple months ago I gave it a fair chance and now it is my favourite MMO by a wide margin, I feel there is still a pretty steep learning curve and it can be rather difficult to find what you like but my 3 tips would have to be
---
1. Find yourself a good (and active!) Corp. This makes a massive difference because it gives you people to play with and things to do if you want to join them
---
2. Set yourself a goal. Wether it's making your first billion isk or flying a ship you think looks awesome, set yourself a goal and work towards it, it gives you something to set your sights on.
---
3. If you are feeling bored or burnt out, try something different!. If you are bored of mining, ratting or industry try something different to mix it up!. Go blow up some unsuspecting miner!, Go attack that rat battleship in a frigate! (Actually more fun than it sounds), work towards building a badass ship!. Explore the endless expanse of space!. There is so much you can do in eve it's amazing so if you are bored of whatever you are doing try something else just for a change and who knows, you might like it better.
---
Basically what you're doing is pyfa-warrioring for mining. Travel time and partially wasted cycles bring these numbers down quite a bit in reality. While I do like the changes, your arguments are not entirely factual. Especially the arguments you make about the moon mining income in that other comment you made, since those figures get HAMMERED by the low volume per rock.
---
That's what I thought that Ballistic Control Systems were for initially
---
Any of those drone boats?  If not,  what's the meta for that? 
---
Sorry to disappoint you, but [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta)
---
My rocket destroyer can now fit a single medium shield extender!
---
Ishtar I suppose is still an option, as it still works with the skills I've trained up.  Gila nerf on the other hand  (odd that they didn't nerf the Snake along with the VNI and Gila if they were nerfing drone ratting)
---
A bit out of my league, and is that really viable with multiple accounts? 
---
I care
---
they are used  to help run some sites in wormholes. 
---
Carriers quite a ways out of my league now..  and as with some other suggestions,  is that really viable on a solo account? 
---
Titans can fit remote bosonic field generators with a range of 8 light years and can be initiated with a cyno. 
---
Pretty weak memes
---
^ this. I I stop taking damage from the BSs around 700m/s. Max speed is typically around 1000m/s, so I doubt the 10m increase in sig will be enough to offset that much speed. I guess it'll hurt people who don't have good nav/engineering skills
---
Seriously.
---
Considering if you wanted to go max ISK efficiency, you could reprocess the damaged one to offset the cost even more.
---
Here's a good question for an industrialist, does reprocessing damaged modules give you less material? Is it even possible to reprocess damaged modules?
---
not on either alliance...keeping up with reddit trash lol
---
The Leshak viewed from above isn't all *that* far off from the Adidas logo.
---
Please let it be so.
---
I raise the counterpoint that content creators deserve to be paid for their efforts.
---
However, alliances would only support their leaders and FC team, leaving the smallgang-solo group out to dry.
---
Thankfully, CCPPA knows where their bread is buttered.
---
From *Inheritance* we are told that the Talocans created Anoikis (W-space). Reading back on that chronicle, one quote struck me as relevant if the Trigs are in fact Talocan descendants:
---
&gt; This is not merely stellar engineering. This is engineering the topology of space and time so as to serve a civilization. This was nothing less than an attempt to focus the telos of the universe itself on their existence and needs. Astounding arrogance. A hubris the like of which casts we Jove into the role of humble mendicants to the impassive stars. We should be thankful that the Talocan, while leaving their traces behind them, are no longer present in New Eden or Anoikis.
---
Maybe their hubris finally caught up to them somehow, relegating them to their "hell" or the Abyss.
---
Try using it on the phone with a customer...
---
Have you been to Fanfest?
---
You should log a bug if you haven't already and use this clip (and your last) as proof. I used your last clip on my entry about 2 weeks back along with one of my own as I have hit this 3 times now myself. It'd be awesome to see this fixed. :)
---
It’s easy to stay away from that conversation.
---
Until they ask ‘what’s that tag on your bag for’?
---
Well...
---
Or: I’m going to a convention.
---
Really? Where?
---
- Iceland
---
Iceland?!? They have conventions in Iceland? What for?
---
- It’a s local product.
---
It’s software?
---
- Yeah. I go there, meet some people...
---
A few minutes later “What’s EVE Online?”
---
And away we go...
---
Minor tweak: It only works on capsules and it prevents both warping and self-destruct.
---
sorry cannot arrive.. i saw people doing 4/10 sites in algos/astero but thats insane hardcore. i have doine sansha natio occupied mining colony in thrasher but took me half hour to run site. got only true sansha adaptive nanomembrane true sansha medium repper .... the hero algos was playing around vylade aunia and fricoure,he was running  sepentis phi outposts in  algos only. only for final room he invited  4 more algos players either alts or friend.. it was time when was running there lvl4 agent missions,it was my first mission running spot after dodixie and ashokon.  stopped doing misssions and im  hunting ded sites and explorng wormholes for relic sites. i run data for filaments . i only aim for  electric ones  i sell others. 
---
as for mul-zatah you can run it alone.. kill the web towers first,the one on front of you,move up to pass far from another webber then pop ithat,remember to avoid contact with rats,minimum distance 15km from them must be keept....  when all front web towers are gone aim drones at "inner sanctum" blow it up  launch mtu,bookmark it warpout for 2-3 minutes. warp to bookmarked mtu scoop n loot. 
---
i have bad news about mul zatahs. i've done  within month around 300 of them.  i did count all,from 251 sites  i was getting only overseer or overseer and some useless t1/meta mods. some had c type mods some had only green faction mods and once got ashimmu bpc. only one time.  
---
problem with mul-zatah monasetry is that cnanot cargo scan inner sanctum.  u can scan dark blood alpha in ded 3/10 to see if hes worth popping.
---
take people in destroyers then,
---
LMFAO that epic PEW PEW 
---
I'm not nearly confident enough in my own nerdery to talk to anyone about Eve :(
---
I think that you should require 33%/50% more SP to fill an injector if your account is being plexed.
---
i dont have problems with drone aggro. dock up leave ship, enter ship if you get bad aggro. theres a known bug. otherwise its basically tehsame
---
that said i  only do abyss on a solo account or 3 hawks. can easily multibox 2 if 1 friend lets you anchor up and then u do dark 5s
---
please  oracle with 8 of those and  triglavin titan/dread with 7 of these. ccpls
---
Man do people not recognize the navy seal copypasta anymore... What has the world come to.
---
mmm glue
---
Nou
---
Because some people have many accounts and paying $300/mo for a video game is silly. Incidentally, if you have to "do pve" to afford plex you're doing it wrong. People that are new though, yeah it's probably best to pay for a sub since you don't have the skills or knowledge to make the big bux yet.
---
Will CCP ever fix afk cloaky camping?
---
iv kvnow vrightv hev doesntv knvow vwhat hve's tvalkving avbout
---
apoc is tracking bonused, and actually has a tank. as opposed to the oracle which isnt tracking bonused and has no tank. 
---
"reeee i'm a fucking retard please help me"
---
good god now i remember why i left this sub
---
wtf?? we take every bait I've ever seen even knowing we would be outnumbered
---
nah, because the incomming shield reps actually add a layer of buffer (all be it, shitty buffer) on top of the armor reps, and allow more time for the armor reps to land.  
---
as an example, think of the masb and saar breacher.  you wait until youre in armor before you rep at all. and you take advantage of the shield boost bonus, and use it to allow you to get off all the charges of the saar. 
---
Ok, now THAT's a real spoiler alright. I basically stopped the video because of it.
---
this is the kind of shitpost that I enjoy 
---
bang bang
---
Gosh, I miss that neocon..
---
minor tweak: requires IntelHD graphics to work.
---
Ya great idea, let’s add fuel consumption to AB,MWD,MJD as well, maybe add fuel required to launch drones from drone bay too. Maybe add fuel bays to all ships. Or just no
---
lmao
---
Imagine being this obsessed with goons
---
minor tweak: 100m3 cargo
---
In which /u/calmatt makes yet another terminally stupid post.
---
Is that your video? Did you extract the game files to find the animations?
---
But then how does PGL get on Canadian news?
---
Relic sites, commander NPC wrecks.
---
If they have lower margins, they have to bot more to keep the lights on.
---
Plex has not stopped going up, nor has the whining about botting.
---
I bet my ass there's a connection.
---
Not me, no. But you can find the animations [here.](http://caldariprimeponyclub.com)
---
We've been waiting far too long for the legendary BigMak doctrine
---
I mean this takes planning. This doesn't usually just happen. 
---
Fwiw haven't lost a pirate clone in over year... Maybe even a pod. And I fly exclusively null &amp; low. 
---
It would have to be an extended period of time for it to make an actual impact. Anyone who uses local for intel would simply not log in if it only existed in the realm of hours/days and was rare.
---
Jesus Christ I can only get so erect
---
&gt; Maybe their hubris finally caught up to them somehow, relegating them to their "hell" or the Abyss.
---
East of New Eden?
---
He will go back to cheesing FW LP, like all good shit tier scrubs.
---
Time to buy low and sell high.... CCP, you may charge the normal credit card.... my usual order please
---
Don’t I need an exploration or combat ship for those?
---
Just another reason to turn auto-repeat off on that thing.  Been doing that for a while.  Saves the cap a bit.
---
Best be referencing the post I made almost a year ago about trig mining ships.
---
If it could act as a special event, maybe like something that happens randomly an anomaly over new eden that disrupts the signal... There could be a way to predict it this, with a certain activity. 
---
That way you could plan attacks, set up defenses around your home area to prevent enemies intruding trying to ambush your miners/ratters... 
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
they will fly for whoever can RMT their replacements.... FRAT CEO ... with the least delay.

Nicely done lads and gals, no doubt he'd be proud of ya and appreciative 
---
CAPS FOR ETERNAL VICTORY!
---
If this is what the AT died for it's a cost I'm willing to pay
---
Minor tweak: whole sub becomes locked 🔒
---
Oh wait, wrong thread...! 
---
That's dumb, and you know it.  My very specific issue is that I am looking for balancing that doesn't hamper this playstyle, with effectiveness regained by N+1 mechanics.
---
A small tune to fighter application would've been much more in order, rather than just a large nerf.
---
Given the flat 100% damage increase on dreads, I'd have to argue that it's a flat 50% damage nerf, not halving the damage bonuses.
---
K-space Relic sites generally have no rats.
---
Obviously for NPC commander wrecks you'll need to kill them first.
---
So the Corax will be good now?
---
There was activity graph by time and day. That was easy to confirm the players active time.
---
We need a 3rd stage guild navigator.

Yeah I pay for my first account as a year long subscription. This is for my Alt which I cover with PI.

Ain’t no way I’m paying more than $100 a year for this game. I love you guys, but no.

Done that.

If you want to avoid caps then a Rattlesnek has always been good (albeit expensive).
---
For maximum memes join a WH corp and run C5 sites with other guys in Nestors/Leshaks (need at least 2 Nestors for a C5 site, 3 if you want to kill the Drifter), you can easily net more than solo NS/LS ratting can bring you.

Had a perfect rorq pilot before skill injectors and rorq changes. I feel as though youre one of the many youngsters who hopped on the rorq bandwagon and never did any real mining. If you had ever used barges you qould know just how little interaction a rorq takes

said teenager will either be very interested quickly or not at all. you'll find out soon 
---
I don’t care about ratting so much as its ability, the VNI was a great droneboat with the drone velocity bonus but now you can’t chase with drones much more than a normal Vexor without it.

Once you have perfect rorq skills it is a much larger difference, epsecially with t2 rigs.

I agree, shrinking mobile depots is not the way to go.  I'm pretty sure it would mess with *stuff* (maybe short-term storage?) although I'm too inexperienced to know exactly what.

It really depends on if all these changes as a whole increase or decrease mineral prices because if they stay the same the rorq really isn't worth it unless you are fielding a fleet of them.

Super carrier ratting is stupid because of what reason? Those are 100-120mil ticks. That's without an officer or cap spawn.

That’s not true at all. I am totally fine with the potential fights we get on our War HQ. I am 100% certain we’re gonna get blobbed like crazy just so people can say they “defeated” Pirat, but it’s not going to be a deathblow :)
---
The reason why I don’t favor structures is because I give a week... maybe a month.. maybe two months before you’re tired of chasing our timers around. Then whose going to shoot at our structure? No one! You will be hard pressed to find other Highsec groups lining up to respond to timers.
---
Yeah you’re going to get your blob on, but it’s not going to have a long lasting and positive effect on the ecosystem in New Eden. 
---
For exploration, *technically* you can bolt an analyzer onto whatever ship you want.  You'd get better results out of a T1 frigate, however, and they're almost free.  Exploration hulls get progressively better and more expensive, so you'd have to decide where you want to draw the line on your cost/performance curve.
---
Running combat signatures is pretty good money within my experience, however (I lived in the dronelands for a while, and the commanders would drop drone goo for excavs.  Outside I think they drop faction mods and implants).  Most of those sites you could do with a T3 destroyer for low risk / slow reward.
---
ah damn he got a promotion nice
---
This to a tee.. Its yield isnt the problem the shear number and infinite availability of resources is. Either one per belt or diminishing returns some how. Its fucking silly.. In theory they can just perma panic.. How has this not gone unnoticed!
---
The n+1 afk nature of the hull means nothing else is going to get used.. Look at vni/gila.. Whats the point in ratting in ANYTHING else.. Besides guess what bigger versions.. Gila and carriers!

The Gila has been overpowered for years lol

Which is why I said it was the MAX output. You can plug in numbers you find more "realistic" but in my experience you can expect -10-15% off the max mining value which is still pretty considerable for an income that has huge scaling potential. "Oh no, we can't make 200m/hr with each rorq now!" Cry me a fucking river.
---
&gt;since those figures get HAMMERED by the low volume per rock.
---
"low volume" here means 120-250k m3 at even 1/2 max pull on a moon, and if you are in an alliance that has a broad amount of space that's regularly 350k-500k m3 rocks. Not even mentioning the potential for lucky strikes on a moon.
---
You'd have to be repositioning after every indy cycle to seriously affect your income when moon mining. Tbf though, you're in Bastion which is percolating with j4gs so I can understand why that might be an issue for you.
---
nsa cycle time reduction plz
---
Thats not any after death paradise, it is slav paradise!
---
Needs some trig squat memes I thinks.
---
So, for some clarification - the Triglavians are definitely not the Talocan, given that CCP said as much during the[ fanfest lore roundtable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNk6VFvLTcw) last year. While we don't know who they are exactly, there are [a lot of strong clues](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/compilation-speculation-the-lore-of-the-enheduanni-and-what-they-may-have-become/139682) that suggest some possibilities.
---
The above would also fit for them calling the Drifters "Ancient Enemy", especially given theories on [that faction's origin](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/compilation-speculation-the-lore-of-the-drifters-and-their-other-possible-identity/143079/4) as well. On the side of the Talocan again, however - though they aren't the Triglavians, I'd bet they're involved here.
---
The name Talocan is extremely derivative of "Tlalocan", the first "heaven" in Aztec mythology - New Eden being paradise beyond home would make it "Tlalocan". We also know the Talocan influenced spacetime to make travel and movement effortless, and designed the Anoikis cluster (w-space), which seemingly moves into higher levels. 
---
Aztec mythology has [thirteen heavens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Heavens), which could be compared to W-space, plus additional classes/realms we haven't hit. But there was also an underworld, [Mictlan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mictl%C4%81n).
---
If the Triglavians didn't create the Abyss, and instead took up residency in it, it'd match the Aztec cosmology once again - thirteen heavens, and 9 levels of the underworld - combined with the Talocan and their "grand design" as we learn in [Inheritance](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/inheritance/), I'd bet that's the true nature of both w-space and the Abyss - and that the Talocan have moved into places we can't yet see (though would we even want to? yeah, of course we would).

Its still too slow with no other reason to fly it. 
---
I'm not sure how I feel about it yet. One one hand caps are so meme tier cheap now compared to a year or two ago that the insurance changes still make them cheaper than a year ago. On the other hand some people might be less willing to dreadbomb. Either way caps costing less than 800m after insurance really isn't acceptable considering that makes them cheaper to losse than many battleship/t3 cruiser doctrines.

The mother of all problems in this game is umbrella space being too much advantageous and accomodating to everyoned.

We needed anom rework and cyno inhibition rework. We got PANIC nerf, yield nerf, tank nerf, and volume/wetu nerf. All of these which creating additional reasons why a Rorq should move in Delve, Esoteria, and so on. So WP to GSM on that part (they either intentionally manipulated stuff, or didn't have a clue about the effects of their 
---
FAX nerf, fighter application nerf, and HAW nerf are fine.
---
This is probably the most likely answer.
---
&gt; Yeah you’re going to get your blob on, but it’s not going to have a long lasting and positive effect on the ecosystem in New Eden.
---
That depends very much on what incentives CCP gives to put all your eggs in one basket. 
---
If CCP wants to play this aggressively, they should just add a multiplier to every unique war-hq per alliance and encourage people to centralise them all on a central location.
---
Good luck with 50 groups working together to come down on your main HQ.
---
Can rorquals still use deployable micro jump drives

Tweak: All items are reprocessed.
---
Yeah it will be interesting to see how CCP tweaks things as they release. I can’t say that we would stand a chance at all if 50 groups came after us, especially if we only have 1 War HQ. Sounds to me like you’re in favor of anything that completely kills this part of the game though. Weird how people are hellbent to have gameplay removed just because they find it unsavory. Do you not find any reason for wars to exist in Eve?
---
light cyno, in jumps JF, Alohasnackbars and wipes all supers in a 15km radius, we have fixed the wrecking ball problem bois.
---
I would argue that those timers are meant for either strategic gain / defense or they are to provoke a response in which a fight escalated in your favor.
---
I don’t see you getting that kind of experience out of chasing around our timers. Who knows, you may like it though! Like I said, just because timers and structures are a thing in Nullsec doesn’t mean that they are actually good for the game everywhere. I think the “content” will be short lived though. 
---
Don't forget they added more time to the bomb as well, so more time to shoot them down.

Will do! Should I do the SoE epic arc before Eve University, or after?

gila's at least needed something done about the 100mn ab fleets.

I'm pretty ok with beam buffs tbh. It's been too long since lasers were a top tier medium weapon system.

Why?

Goons will care about getting tackled a lot more when they're increasingly forced to spread out via lower anom spawn rates and capitals no longer being nearly as efficient at killing subs.

---
You know man, having been decced many a time by you guys and generally finding most highsec war shit pretty annoying I actually agree with a bunch of this. I like the recent change requiring a structure to be Dec eligible but I don't think the war headquarters needs to happen. Just remove neutral logi and up the war cost and leave it alone.
---
&gt; Though fresh ideas and input are very welcome.
---
Here is one rule you should self-impose.
---
If someone accepts to be a mod then they should give up the rights to stuff like toxicity, [obfuscation of legitimate balance threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b0pt5f/hidden_nerf_to_excavator_booshing_btw/eigbo5e/) by off-topic assholery, agenda-following, trying to trigger people they don't like into saying bannable stuff, any kind of trolling, and so on.
---
Most of the stuff above is allowed for posters for freedom of speech reasons. But this doesn't change this kind of stuff should be undesired and discouraged. It sets a bad precedent if even mod do this stuff. They should be held to a higher standard. Modding is a position of authority and acting in the abose stated manners breaks the trust in mods and in the subreddit in general. Other such positions, such as judges, have codes of conduct such as "avoiding appearance of impropriety", that expects more than a standard citizen. Mods here should impose some similar stuff.
---
If these standards are too much for a mod, then they can give up modding.
---
Thank you for your insight and wisdom. Care to elaborate?
---
lol they were 600mill when I started playing.
---
I haven't salvaged since probably 2015
---
I think it’s cute you guys still giving Viktor a hard time for his suggestion. 
---
Go to Zoohen(Genesis) and ask Signal Cartel.  Some of the most trusting pilots in the game.  
---
If you are bitching about your HAW Titan not being able to wreck subcaps as easily as before I think the changes are on the right track.
---

Haha calmatt is such a fucking dweeb. Except he wont see this because he blocked me like a pussy

Devs probably have a wall of shame for everyone who was dumb enough to train that.
---
It’s a good book, generally doesn’t require a huge amount of EVE knowledge. Might not be that engaging for a teenager, but I enjoyed it. 
---
It's a pretty easy site you just need to be able to snipe (50km+ range, ideally not drones bar sentries).
---
On warp in just clear the grid, it's pathetically easy and shouldn't take long. Take the accel gate to the second room.
---
Second room, don't move. Target the **Inner sanctum** and snipe it to death.
---
Bookmark the can that drops and warp out.
---
Wait for the site to despawn (2-3 mins) and warp back to the can.
---
Enjoy your loot.
---
All together shouldn't take more than 10 mins and gives decent BR C-type cruiser size loot.

Ty. Why not for a teenager?

I used barges extensively up until a year ago. I interact about the same between the two.
---

---
It’s a lot about nullsec politics and intrigue - but as another poster commented, it probably depends on the kid. 
---
I'm amazed you guys remembered the GNI exists, also would be amazing if non-cap faction guns could finally use T2 ammo.
---
They dont care about stolen drones...they want drones dying with the rorq
---
Yeah I don't think the current war system is perfect, which is why I've advocated for some changes and have enjoyed working with Brisk Rubal in the Wardec Project Discord. While it has definitely been noticeable in the amount of people we can shoot, I think the war eligibility thing is nice. It does leave a bad taste in my mouth that it's bypassed so easily with ACL's, but hey.. at least the children are protected!
---
Wars need more attention than just removing neutral logi and changing war costs. The rallying behind all these changes are driven by the want to see content and features removed from us. We need changes that will alter the meta of almost exclusively camping trade hubs and pipes. Changes that empower and give incentive to players to either fight back on their own or enlist help.
---
I wish I had a direct line of communication with CCP, because while I appreciate Brisc being our go-between-guy, there's some things that we don't see eye to eye on and I'm sure he's not pushing to devs ;)
---
Any specific reason they hate EVE?
---
My "favorite" part of EVE is how anything you say about it requires eight paragraphs of backstory and context.
---
I sold two at 300mil to afford my first freighter for 700mil.
---
I honestly don’t know, but I hadn’t been there long when I had to make my first business trip to Iceland. I was looking to hit the monument on a free day and it was like farting in church. Maybe the CEO got scammed in Jita or something?
---
I eventually made it to the monument next trip, I just didn’t say anything. 
---
I'm guessing they hear about it/see it everywhere. I used to live near hobbiton and have grown to hate LOTR
---
Your entire corps philosophy is gank haulers in shiny Vindicators, and run away if they bring an actual fleet. Because 'lmao blob' as if a hauling ship stood a chance vs a gate camp. 
---
The changes are great, and it will be difficult for you to keep wars going indefinitely. As it should be. 
---
Excavators are the only risk factor for umbrella Rorquals in certain regions, which do about half of mining in this game (and a greater portion of all null mining).
---
They should care about excavators. Perhaps even more so.
---
"yeah it's kinda hard to explain. You fly spaceships and blow stuff up but most people just shoot at computer controlled ships or mine rocks all day. Yeah I don't really know why they do it either"

It's an awfully weird niche to make this not abusable.  
---
It needs to be raw reps, but also not count overhealing.
---
have fun with slow as fuck drones, lmao
---
I guess I just think that while obviously there is always room for sensible iteration at some level the war dec system is a lot like the bounty system. It's this thing trying to do something that should be great but is immensely difficult to keep from being gamed out. There certainly is some value in figuring it out though as like you sort of indicated otherwise you end up with a million highsec citadels in alt corps. 
---
Our Alliance is built in a way where we try to control and interdict traffic around the busiest area in Highsec (probably the game, tbh). For the most part we try to kill everything we can, and yes you won't find us taking a fight if we feel there's a chance we'll get wiped.
---
It makes sense to me, really. Our entire playstyle revolves around guerrilla tactics where we almost always have the advantage. We don't want to walk into a fight that is favorable to you, but we want to set it up where we're going to come out on top - yes it happens.
---
I am excited to see how things pan out. As you know, we'll do everything we can to fight dirty and maintain our position!
---
I am a simple wormholer, I see post praising Bob, I upvote.

Are you implying that being a goon make it easier for me to call "free fire on algos"?

This isn't a real measurement.  It's not like the dudes with 12 rorquals are stopping when "they get enough to meet their industry needs".
---
you made mistake!!... now you'll get addicted and can't get away from it.
---
Welcome :)
---
It may be that CCP started the tourist movement that brought the great unwashed to pristine Iceland. I can see that as a source of problems.
---
I don’t know what the perception of EVE is in Iceland today, it has to be one of their largest exports.
---
If you only see the tourists ogling Hobbiton, I can see where you would get sick of seeing them.
---
&gt;I personally would have preferred a haw tracking penalty for titans
---
Delete HAW guns and give dreads a *significant* buff.  They may need a signature radius/tracking rebalance between battleships and capitals.
---
I love every single thing in this Dev Blog. 
---
Yes I need to do that!! You've had it happen 3 times already!? Holy crap man, that's horrible... No body should ever have to feel the pain that we've felt hahah.
---
So dumb question - what's the proper way to report this? In game or on the website? 
---
So there is counterplay but it requires effort on your part. Hrm seems like you just want free krabbing. Maybe you shoild just adapt! ITS A CLOAKY SHIP! Just bring more friends to act as juicy bait.
---
Still better than giving a carrier. People will always adapt. Maybe you will get some kills when it is deployed. But people may realize it's not worth anymore. If VNI don't cut. Maybe we will go back to gilas or mirmydons. 
---
With the Rorqual Nerf and insurance nerf it's pretty much what gonna happen.
---
Get your dank leet carriers killmails while they are still out there
---
Boosh in highsec? yes fucking please.
---
It's like the kid in school that really wanted to be the hall monitor, for the minuscule amount of power...

I feel I should elaborate; I certainly don't mean to be that guy who's like "ugh tourists are the worst", I like to see people enjoying my country in whatever way they want and I'm always as welcoming as possible. It's just personally I've been so oversaturated with lotr references that I have no desire to hear about it if at all avoidable. I'll speculate that ops work mates feel the same

1. If they interact with each other, ie sending isk between them, then it'll raise eyebrows. Otherwise no. 
---
2. Overkill, won't help you in regards to #1 and most people don't need it.

3. Overkill.
---
4. Just use separate email addresses for each character and account but beyond that it's overkill.
---
5. Not sure what you mean?
---
The API checks are going to look at interactions with other accounts/players that could potentially be alts, seeing you send 2bil to a character with a similar name is clearly an alt. Keep each one completely separate and don't add your chars to contacts or send isk and you should be fine. The biggest hurdle is going to be getting some activity on zkill and such on so many characters to actually get into a lot of these corps.

Anomalies should spawn, you might need to travel to a less popular area though or take sov to install the upgrades. Wormhole anomalies spawn but in the systems you can use moveme for they're run by titans, so you'd need to scan a static in one of them and go to a different system. 
---
I think the idea that a handful of groups can wardec tens of thousands of characters with little counterplay is counterproductive to the game's health yes. 
---
These changes go some way to change that. If you want to poke a lone bear, good luck, if you want to poke 50 bears at once and not expect them to maul you to death, then I would argue that is not really in the spirit of consequence.
---
By all means, wardec half the galaxy, but be prepared to face the consequences.

The counterplay is in the combat in my opinion. I know it's not everyones cup of tea, but that's how guerrilla warfare is fought. You want to kill us, but you want it the easy way. You want CCP to change the game so that you and others can do so.
---
I agree with you about poking everyone, but understand that its prevalence is directly because of how the war meta has shifted over time. Increased war costs in the past, removal of the watch list, and now war eligibility. The pilots that enjoy this kind of content will adapt to ensure that content is there... So you increase how many active wars you have and you sit near trade hubs.
---
Having relatively free travel of highsec and fight generation is a far more tangible strategic gain than most null timers to the average linemember tbh. I think that while hs content certainly wont eclipse null content, you'll get a lot more takers than you think here on a regular basis.
---
Ccplease allow us to save a planetary setup and drop it on a planet! So many needless clicks. 
---
&gt; So there is counterplay but it requires effort on your part.
---
No amount of effort will counter it. That's my point. We could have 1000 guys combing every grid and never find them.
---
&gt;Just bring more friends to act as juicy bait.
---
Are you fucking blind? I just said they don't take the bait. We've set out VNIs, HACs, T3Cs, carriers, they don't bite. The only thing they have ever bit down on was a rorqual and we smacked them down. And guess what? Still fucking camping.
---
I’m guessing it was some sort of joke, right.
---
Either way, as a mod, he should try to not appear to be such an asshole, even if just a joke.
---
Oh god this is literally me. A few years ago, through external circumstances, some random girl and I got stuck together for a couple hours with literally nothing to do but chat. Never met each other before. Started with typical bullshit small talk "what do you do, where do you work, etc". She was cute, so I was doing my usually spilling spaghetti everywhere, but I successfully didn't mention eve.
---
Then she asked me what I do for fun. 
---
I sperged about eve for close to two hours. She wasn't much of a gamer, had no idea what eve was, yet she listened and asked questions the entire time. Genuine curiosity, mixed with a little bit of "holy shit, this exists?", and a touch of horror towards our/my sociopathic tendencies in game as well as how far we take things to achieve our goals.
---
2 years later, we got married. Sometimes, uncontrolled eve autism gets the girl.
---
Yeah, acting like an asshole is very not-Eve
---
I'm sorry you were bullied. May I ask how you were bullied though? I can't help but feel that maybe you weren't given proper direction on how to operate while at war.

---
These are really basic things that most pilots don't learn about or bother to do. Instead you have terrible CEO's and mentors that either recommend you stay docked up, stay logged off, then possibly not return to the game. Rest easy though, as now new or uninterested players can opt out of war by not anchoring a structure.
---
At one point I may have been willing to listen to your arguments with an open mind. But since you all wardecced Signal Cartel, the only corp in EvE that would never ever shoot first. I'm less willing to listen to your arguments. 
---
As a member of Signal Cartel, I offer the traditional traditional fireworks and snowballs. 
---
As a member of Horde, though, I'll say we like fights, and we like kill-timers, and we have a lot of bloodthirsty beans who want to get their kill requirements fulfilled early each month. I'm sure we'll see each other on grid. :) 
---
As someone that use to mine in WH, it took me almost a year to stop hitting Dscan every couple of seconds when I moved back to HS.
---
I think  “elite” npc ships drop blue salvage. Eve uni says they spawn in sanctums but I haven’t seen any yet. Am I on the right track?
---
Also is elite also a designation for player ships?
---
As one of the folks who suggested an anchorable structure that the aggressors would have to defend to a few CSM members at this point.  Here's why I suggested it.
---
I've been around a while, and while my primary character is a null sec pilot the large majority of my time has been dealing with trying to get folks into the game which usually starts in high sec.  
---
Invariably they would get to a point where they got noticed and war decs would start, often from Marmite or one of the other mass wardec groups.  This was usually about the time they acquired their first freighter. This would generally end to the group quitting the game because there was nothing they could do to get out of the 'at war' state. There was no 'win' condition in the war for their side.
---
They couldn't really ask for help because even if we spend a month or two babysitting them, the wardec would persist, and it's be back to being ganked constantly as soon as 'big brother' was gone.  We'd get no fights because said wardeccers wouldn't bother to engage them while we were around and would just go elsewhere to harass one of the other 50+ wardeced groups.
---
Their only real effective answers were a.) corp hop, b.) stay in NPC corps, or c.) join up with another null sec or low sec group.  Either way costing them their identity and independence at which point they'd go back to whatever game they'd come from.
---
With a way to 'win' a defensive war, most of that changes.  It provides a goal where none other then 'wait until they get bored' existed.  
---
It's not perfect but that's the reason for it's suggestion.
---
After the third group of associates that fell into this same pattern, I really gave up trying to bring anyone to the game that I couldn't almost immediately throw into an established group.  
---
Putting a war in on Signal Cartel makes sense to me... Yeah they are harmless, but they are explorers that often times can carrying good loot.
---
We enjoyed your attempt yesterday with the Talwar fleet. ;)
---
Stand by for this to hit 3b.
---
No it doesn't. On moons with rigs that would clump the asteroids closer together, it would fuck over all but the first few (especially with the changing dynamics of the belt). Hell, it would even fuck over those who clump up in regular belts.
---
Give the corax a speed buff to keep up with things it wants to use those rockets on and we're on to something .... 
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
yeh this allows them to make FAX and logi more powerfull at small scale without just blowing the balance of fleet fights out
---
Considering the majority of the mineral markets have cratered over the past 2 years, the Rorqual getting shot in the leg is worth it.
---
so funny that it was exactly in Zoohen :D
---
I did the first room by myself, but second room i got volleyed 300 damage and i got scared, lol. Then i finally asked in local as the last resort and some guy helped me out, i chatted with him for few hours now and i will join his corp. Not from Signal Cartel though, but i'm going to say hi to them if i see anyone around :)
---
I haven’t played eve in like four years and I still say tac 
---
As i said, i'm a newbro, 1.2m SP total with quite a lot of it in exploration. This isn't as easy for me as it is for you :P

Just things like being relentlessly hunted while i was trying to mission run or mine. Being camped into station. Being alphaed off the dodixie undock in an unfit burst by instalock tornados.

My CEO recommended undocking and going down swinging. Really hard to do when you are reduced to undocking in Velators because you are literally out of isk.

This. I was in class one day and saw that the first virtuoso was killed and I was kinda bummed because I live near stain and was toying with the idea of trying to bait it like the guys that killed it did. I ended up explaining exploration, the alliance tournament, stealth bombers, the whole ISK&gt;plex&gt;irl money conversion thing, and how npc regions and sov regions work.

Jibbles does not 'mod-deep-throat' and made an effort to create a discord in which new players are legit directed to spaces where they get answers.

I don't normally reddit from my phone and I missed the context when only reading the reply. That's my bad lol.
---
I see your point. I support the war eligibility change, but would do some tweaking on how ACL's are used to bypass this. Your past grievances are almost completely solved here with that single change, which has nothing to do with Upwell structures.
---
I understand that a option to win a defensive is important, and I agree. What I don't agree with is that a group of newer and mostly passive players that just trained into their first freighter is going to come and bash 3 timers with the type of response that Marmite and Pirat can bring.
---
Since things are different now, I encourage you to get back to it though. A few nights ago I spent almost 2 hours watching an Eve Online streamer. He was a literal brand new player and I was offering the basic helpful advice that new players need such as how to adjust your overview, what things do, how to pilot your ship, and just all the many things that can be confusing or overwhelming. During this whole process I explained all the areas of space and what the differences were. I made sure I consistently mentioned that Highsec isn't safe and what he can do to have the cards in his favor. It was fun.
---
Can we ban people who don't use the dark setting?  This seems like the real issue here.
---
It didn't look too different to me, or what am I missing?
---

Being able to kill a structure to end a war dec makes sense to me, we are explorers who like to get their expensive loot all the way to market. 
---
We are still having internal discussions about whether a war dec is a significant enough act of aggression that we could destroy a war dec hq without it jeopardizing our reputation. And ultimately we will abide by whatever our decision is.

More than a decade ago, I went for a job interview. Interview went fairly standard until...

“So what are your hobbies?”
---
I like reading and I do play computer games
---
“Oh? What computer game do you play?”
---
EVE Online
---
“Never heard of it. What kind of game is it?”
---
*dam breaks* 
---
20 minutes later
---
“Well I have to say you’ll really enthusiastic about it”
---
Needless to say I didn’t get the job...
---
Thou ironically I got another job about a year later and it used the above company as a supplier. Met the above interviewer again. 
---
bumping, lag, wormholes, botting, anoms, lowsec gate to stain, relic sites, autocannons, cruise missles, moon mining

Very excited but it needs a bit of a speed buff as well. I want to rocket something to death ... but as it is today it needs to stop moving, damnit!
---
Not soon enough ... 
---
database numbers that could have been tweaked moths/years ago... it seriously takes forever for them to adjust anything. they could have done most of these changes piecemeal to adjust individual hulls and not let the game stagnate so fucking hard. 
---
33% bonus to the volume within your optimal.
---
&gt; The counterplay is in the combat in my opinion.
---
If you want to make that argument, I'm afraid you'd first have to wait for everyone to develop sudden collective amnesia and forget that the overwhelming majority of people killed in wardecs by the largest group are individual pilots, almost always flying alone and unescorted around trade hubs, or through pipe systems.
---
Also, killing your structures is a way to force an end to the war. If their intent was to continually kill you, they would leave the structure un-touched and allow you to continue to pay for their right to shoot you.
---
And my axe!

&gt; I don't multibox.

Ok
---
&gt; This is hisec in 2013.
---
I started playing in 2012 and my first corp in Highsec used an intel channel so we could mine and mission and be safer while at war.
---
&gt; I didn't have one.
---
No Teamspeak in 2013? Sounds like you are either stubborn or the corp you joined was shit. A big part of drawing players in with a good corp is communication and being personal. I would say the CEO did you a major injustice and doesn't have any business trying to create something like that.
---
&gt; That's why only a couple of my barges ever died.
---
Outstanding, that's good.

These people are shooting anything and everything that shows up red. You've been subjected to this yourself you say... Do you think they took the time to make sure they weren't shooting some new player?

can i have more mordus hulls thanks
---
THE RULES
---
Multiple reasons behind it, at least for what response fleets (supercap umbrella) tend to do:
---
1. Projection and flexibility - titan has a jumpdrive, but - opposite to dread - doesn't get forced into being immobilized for 5 minutes by siege. This means you don't have to deal with all the logistics and hassle of getting close to bridger (with keepstar undock it takes time, especially in battleships), fleet can just undock and jump to cyno. This is key for fast response fleets.
---
2. Buffer - when you deal with, say, fleet of HACs or even bombers, when bringing in any subcaps you're very likely to bleed some ships and trade instead of just wiping the grid/forcing hostiles to warp off. Again, dreads as compared to titans have the issue of being unable to receive remote reps when in siege, so being suspectible to have some traded if hostile fleet is ready for dread drop. This is to turn effective response into effective response that gives attackers no way to fight back. If you want actual fight, you'll form subcaps anyway, dropping titans is a way to force no fight happening in first place (reasons for that vary).
---
3. Clearing tackle - this doesn't apply to umbrella, but is valid point in various different scenarios (especially trying to move alone) - having effective HAWs means you have some chance of clearing tackle if you get caught on your own and try to get away. It's very unreliable, but I've seen HAW titans quite effectively blapping dictors/HICs and actually managing to warp off thanks to that; now even unprepared group that just happens to tackle a titan can have a chance of bringing more tackle if they weren't ready for that in first place.
---
4. Fun - bugzapping frigs with HAWs, racing for who gets more killmarks etc. is quite hilarious.
---
It is people like you who write (or don't) /s pompously, or in that case implied
---
But erm, about those dick picks
---
Make sure to do it from the *in game* reporting tool as soon as possible after the next occurrence of the bug so CCP gets all the logs and such.
---
It's examples like these where I like to pose a question:
---
If I were camping a busy pipe in some Nullsec region where my primary objective was to interdict haulers and other relatively defenseless or disadvantaged ships, AND make it out with the loot... would it make sense for me to jump on your Iteron 5 when you have PVP support on-grid that decreases my likelihood of being successful?
---
This type of behavior and gameplay exists in all areas of space. Sure different people are different, but Highsec isn't some magical unicorn where it should be taboo to shoot at some hauler from Nullsec.
---
When I was working as a camp counselor for a week straight my bedtime stories for the kids were Eve online background stories, leading up to the thing I actually wanted to tell them about the last night. The topic was so dry most of them were asleep before I got a third of the way through.
---

---
With prices this high, I'm surprised more people aren't wallet warrioring PLEX. Where are the whales taking advantage of this?
---
I'm not an economist. I'm curious how much PLEX it would take to start dropping the prices back to even 1.5b. Is it tens or hundreds of thousands of units at this point? Millions?
---
just reduce the ammount of anoms/ore that spawns. that will force them to spread, and reduce the resources that sustain high numbers of miners. 
---

---
&gt; They wardecced brave because they knew that they would get lots of easy frags. try again.
---
Yeah it does change things since you literally have, "noobies" in your name. Still, not everyone was a noob and sometimes new players make silly mistakes that absolutely should be punished and taken advantage of... how else are you going to learn not to fly with 700m in your unfit Iteron 5?
---
If you are paying attention, vnis will have much lower ticks because lower dps. T2 fit tier 1 bs usually have +1000 dps. I used my fav bs when ratting. Use yours. Make sure you overtank and fit an mjd the first few times. Mjd if a neutral enters local and warp out. You are more tanky than a vni, insure much better and do more dmg/isk while being tanky. Good choices are raven, rokh, dominix, mega, hyperion, etc. Use your favorite.
---
bring back old aura
---
You're a good ganker, but don't try to deny that PIRAT and a lot of other wardec corps are extremely risk averse. Wars issued by such corps are done with the intent of finding people to shoot at, but not back. You played in Wormhole space from late 2017-2018 in the same corp as me, so you would probably be familiar with attempts by MCAV and NoVacancies to bait HS wardeccers, which typically started with heavy tackle faction battleships and ended with wardec corps warping away after a few losses. There was very little reciprocal engagement, and it was ultimately a mechanic that was used for the longest time to engage in a very pitiful form of PvP. 
---
There can and should be improvements with Structure based combat, and you do make good points about it, but you can't deny that there's a lot of bullshit involved that ought to be iterated on, and neutral logi and wardec costs are just a start. I don't even remember if you can still use neutral Bowheads to store ships with a combat timer, but that was definitely one of those things. 
---
Who cares? 
---
What's a good usage for the Endurance ice mining ship? I played a long time ago and used the Prospect to mine and gank explorers and just saw that this ship has been added since I've last played. I've never mined ice, don't know if it's worth it and don't know where to find it. Any tips before I try and grab this ship?

&gt;Still, not everyone was a noob and sometimes new players make silly mistakes that absolutely should be punished and taken advantage of...
---
Logging in and undocking were a mistake?
---
&gt;how else are you going to learn not to fly with 700m in your unfit Iteron 5?
---
I never did that because i'm not stupid.
---
That said i think the best way to help new players learn the game is to sit down with them first and talk to them not to put a bullet in their head. They can find the bullets on their own without you doing it for them.
---
The weirdest thing to me is that, while she genuinely understands why this hobby means so much to me, and values the friendships I have in this world, and even draws and [paints](https://i.imgur.com/atBwmbg.jpg) eve shit for me and my corpmates, she doesn't play and doesn't want to. I guess she just wants to live vicariously though me? 
---
Glad it worked out for you, good stuff.   And although r/eve can be a touch salty, most of the people who are in game will be willing to help out, as you have found.  Fly safe. 
---
&gt; mechanics that will severely limit their projection of massive force
---
Since you mentioned spreading everyone across more space, we already have a solution for that - jump fatigue.
---
No, of course it wouldn't... but you're expressing a certain amount of cognitive dissonance here.
---
In one breath you suggest that the value is in the fight, but with the next breath you suggest that it makes sense to avoid fights which are not against relatively helpless, unsupported targets.
---
Those two beliefs don't really work together. There is little value or counterplay in a fight which is a foregone conclusion.
---
And that's perfectly okay....  For me Eve's really a secondary hobby to the medieval re-enactment one we do together, she doesn't play eve but gets it....
---
She regularly rolls her eyes at fleet comms tho...

You have to buy me dinner first. I'm not TGAT easy! HashtagTAQOSQAD.

How about you just remove the fucking Rorq from the game for "pressing ceremonial reasons" at this point. Every time I think you idiots couldn't possibly nerf the rorq some more you go and prove just how much lower your balance teams IQ is.
---
Hey Immelman! I can't reasonably say that we aren't extremely risk averse - it's true.
---
What was thought to be a good and easy kill ended up as bait, and that's awesome. We get lazy a lot of the time and end up forgoing proper scouting and whatnot. I will say that with the experience I have as being a Highsec wardec player, I know areas where we are most vulnerable and I can imagine that I would have made different recommendations in order to produce a better result.
---
Yeah fighting in this guerrilla warfare type combat can be real scummy, but if you're dedicated and good at it you can get kills and deny content just out of sheer fear that the innocent Iteron 5 might be bait.
---
My whole point in this is that I don't believe CCP nor the angry mob is going to get the result they desire. We'll see though! Hope all is well :)
---
It's like the aeon of titans lol
---
Yes I have an official statement to release on this matter!!1!11!!!!
---
I don't know of any botters that are in Pirat. We aren't funded by botters. It may be because I joined Pirat when VMG merged. If there are botters, I don't know them.. If they are botting, I hope they get banned. :)
---
I get that “score” or modifier part but how long does that last?
---
What happens when you keep reps cycling and that modifier remains high? Does that mean when 50 faxes run their reps (say 150 reppers) trying to save a titan the first cycle they’ll rep for 40ish% on average then that scores stays high so all of them then rep at 15% for following cycles?
---
Oh god... She's started parroting me in the worst possible moments. Last week, we were stuck in traffic, and some dumbfuck cut me off. Suddenly, my right ear is ringing as she screams **"TACKLE THE FUCKING TOYOTA. I WANT TACKLE ON THAT TOYOTA RIGHT THE FUCK NOW. ALL DPS ON THE TOYOTA, I WANT HIS FUCKING CORPSE"**
---
Do that all the time
---
This was the last straw for me. I just spent over a year training my main for capitals, training a Fax alt, and training a rorqual alt.  
---
What a giant waste of money and time. I win. Bye.
---
Oh that's gold...
---
For me, she know's when I'm on fleets or has a rorqual in core... And thus exactly when to suddenly play the sexvixen card... It's like.... Nooooooooooo.... core red, core red...
---
&gt; Logging in and undocking were a mistake?
---
Absolutely not. That's not playing the game. I don't understand your defeatist attitude. I think it's possible because I've never seen myself as a victim. Who knows?
---
&gt; I never did that because i'm not stupid.
---
Oh I absolutely agree that there's a time and place for having a nice and proper teaching lesson. Eve Online is a harsh game set in a dystopian universe, and I think the fact that Eve Online is / was the way it is / was is perfect. It's not meant to be easy, but it's far from impossible unlike the position you take on this.
---
I read the book BEFORE playing, and it got me hooked on the game. Read at your peril. (It's a great book, and a great game.)
---
Although it has been a busy day with a lot of emotions after the Spring Balance pass change, I wanted to share something cool I made recently.
---
My favorite person in the whole world got into a Leshak and was really excited about it, so I took some of their damage logs as they were shooting a target and wrote up a Jupyter Notebook to read it and present it as a matplot lib graph. It was all over the place at first until I had the epiphany of separating all the different hits by the quality of hit (Smashing, etc.) [and it was much clearer.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/487389101428047892/554910097612996610/leshak-allhits.png?width=888&amp;height=474)
---
I then figured out how much those types of hits' average deviated from the total average and removed that factor. Did you realize, by the way, that it heavily affects dps? Smashing hits are like a 160% multiplier while grazing a target gives you like 65% damage only.
---
After cleaning that factor off the hits, it made this pretty blue line. I've fitted an orange trendline so it's clearer, but you can see how the damage ramps up and caps off and I think that's pretty neat.
---
Not anything ground-breaking, just wanted to share. Hope you all are having a good day.

That's a lie and you know it. Most of the dudes I talk to in corp regularly are have a partner of some sort, whether dating, engaged, or married. I mean, we are largely one of the oldest, in terms of irl age, populations among different games. Eve attracts an older crowd.

---
You misunderstand me. The value is in the fight in which we have an upper hand. That's how we play the game and what we base our strategies off of. We use the mechanics available to everyone in conjunction with attempting to min-max so that we can be efficient in what we do.
---
Hell yeah if you allow us the opportunity to get the edge on you, it might not be as much fun for you as it is for us (if you even have any fun). Losers typically don't have much fun...
---
Thanks
---
Yeah! I'm glad it's still around!
---
There's a big difference between 'Not taking fights where you think you'll get wiped' and the more accurate description of what you do, which is only fight what cannot defend itself. 
---
Yeah, that's what worries me.  If they introduce shield slaves now, they'll have to reduce the shield HP amount to make it balanced (or else hello 100m EHP leviathans), but that just means that every shield super pilot will have to rip out whatever they've got and buy the implants, without actually fixing some of the other issues with shield capitals.  
---
So unless they either don't nerf it too hard or are very careful, they'll end up just making shield supers cost 4b more than they currently do, but not be any better. :(
---
oh my God you made me burst out laughing on my bus and get weird looks I hate you
---
Yeah, either that or add an EANM equivilent for shield modules, or reduce the effectiveness of capital neutralizers the same way they're reducing the effectiveness of cap transfers.  That could work.
---
For me most of changes for null-sec look pretty solvable by “bring more ...”. Which hurts smaller entities while not affecting goons and like.
---
what is the dark setting?
---
Oh, and you'll need a cruiser or a buddy to beat the last boss in SOE. Highly recommend asking someone in Corp chat for help with him, or just asking around in local when you get to that point.
---
i will still build my Nyx but this time i will fit it for PvP and rat with dual boxed thannys

Yeah if you hit F12 in-game it loads the bug entry form. Paste your links in there. :)

Lmao i posted "you come after the community you better not miss" in Sions infamous r/Eve is not a community and he went full retard thinking I sent him a death threat...  stop drinking the goon coolaid. 
---
He caught me off guard with the direction he came into the plex. I had already taken the plex but I wanted the fight. I had just pushed this guy off once but he was so much faster than me I could not make the switch from range to tackle. I thought my web would have let me grab some range but I was wrong. 
---

---
will subs ever be 100$ for a year ever again?
---
Yeah, I'm not really keen on being able to skirt the system, personally with ACL's.
---
And you're right, those new players wouldn't be able to win that fight, they wouldn't have had a dream of it themselves, but it's a perception thing.  
---
It's one thing to say "This is the way EvE is, there's nothing we can do." and another to say "If we get good enough or hire enough help, we can take that down and be done with this."  
---
It gives agency and something to aspire to, both of which are important part.
---
On getting back to it, I've got to stop 'winning' EvE.  I just haven't had the time to log in and do much.  I miss the hell out of it though.
---
That's not true.
---
PH came to fight us on our way back from a structure op. We obliged. We were able to pop 2-3 ships before they fled.
---
We've also had BL bait us very well which resulted in us escalating due to us believing we had an advantage. A few days later we willingly fought them in the same way and ended up losing due to a few pilots mistakes and the massive language barrier between us English speaking members and the Russians. 
---
My point is yeah I'm giving you three examples, but believe it or not there's not a lot of people just rolling through trying to bait us into a fight or even just rolling their large gang through. There are other numerous examples I can give you of us brawling it out with other groups, but it seems like it's much more convenient to focus on when we do turn-tail and leave you blue balled.
---
I'm really thankful I thought to bring a cyno inhib with me,I wanted to find something bigger than a happy fleet and didn't fancy getting interrupted by a Titan.

Luckily I managed to anchor my inhib before the cyno ares got positioned

&gt; And you're right, those new players wouldn't be able to win that fight, they wouldn't have had a dream of it themselves, but it's a perception thing.
---
I hate that our goal is to leave a perception that someone stands a chance even if they don't. I prefer to have a system in which someone may have a reasonable shot... even if they aren't the one involved in combat.
---
There are plenty of pilots and smaller groups in Highsec that absolutely HATE us. This structure change ensures that we will stomp on them and their ability to wardec. Here you have a natural opponent of ours that lives and operates in this space. Players that are accustomed to the wonky mechanics and love it just as much as we do.. CCP would rather throw the fight elsewhere in the name of "perception".
---
I can name plenty of people that would come to stop us on behalf of a client that pays for them to win the war in my scenario I suggested in the OP.
---
&gt; It gives agency and something to aspire to, both of which are important part.
---
Yeah sure I understand the agency and stuff, but what happens when they actually see how stupid and bland structure based combat is? It is different in Nullsec where you have more interesting ways to counter and be tactical on a structure... In Highsec it's just 3 timers against a group that's going to pull out all the stops to defeat you.

Somehow the sub turned into a mix of everyone taking it seriously but at the same time never posting anything serious. To be honest I'm debating bailing on it entirely. Not decided yet but the amount of time required to fix things is just not something I can do. On top of this no viable mod candidates have appeared (Everyone offers to be a mod, very few are actually willing to do the stuff that makes you unpopular for the sake of the subreddit or setting the record straight). The things that made it fun are slowly being replaced with just 1 sentence garbage posts, no one uses the small questions thread and instead spams, newbies are starting to get shit on, it's brigaded to high hell now by multiple groups oh and if you lay down even the smallest of punishments they just brigade and turn it into a huge issue. Since the platform is based on speed alone you have a few hour window to make your case or the damage is done. Currently I'm left with the choice of getting lynched by the community and fixing the sub (as much as we are able anyways) or just hoping the right kind of person appears out of thin air.

WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH I WANT TO AFK CARRIER RAT WITH ZERO RISK INVOLVED
---
 Well at least they are dealing with bots... Oof well at least they aren't nerfing my way of making income mining... Oof man what a time to still be playing for some reason... 
---
What about HACs?  I'm better skilled there.  Could always reshuffle skills if needed. 
---
The key is to not engage worms outside of a hard counter (^:
---
Use tracking enhancers in the mids and the ticks shouldn't be killed much. You'll have to time the NSA correctly now, or fit sebos. Ticks will probably still be the same, it's just an increased risk
---
Like I said, it's "remote rep received per second". So it will compute based on the "per second" part.
---
jibrish is a faggot powermod
---
&gt; With Plex prices what they are, an individual who derives most of their income from carrier or supercarrier ratting to continue to play will need to rat twice as much to continue even playing the game. Combined with the VNI nerfs this significantly impacts the ability of many players to continue playing in a game that already struggles with player retention. 
---
Nerfing isk income lowers PLEX prices
---
Very roughly, if it takes you X hours to grind out 500 PLEX now, then it will still take you X hours once the dust settles from the nerfs
---
&gt; We have plans, and work is already underway, to adjusting the hangars and their lighting situations in near-future releases.
---
two thumbs way up.
---
one specific suggestion: maybe change the lights that are on the floor of most hangars that point upwards so that the flare spot isn't so intense?

AN AFK CLOAKED PLAYER IS NO THREAT TO YOU.
---
Change my mind.
---
As yes, the ole' "it hurts the little guys more than the big guys" argument.
---
We'll just overlook the fact that you mention "average line member" and super ratting in the same post. Now, I haven't lived in null for a while, but last I checked the average line member isn't ratting in a super.
---
Even with VNI nerfs, it will still be easy income that can be done with very little effort, and standard carrier ratting will operate just fine with much less time to payoff.
---
Actually, upon further thought, now I think the viability of offensive reps is really going to depend on the definition of “applied reps”. 
---
If armor repping someone with full armor doesn’t actually apply a rep (like how the notification says 0 hp applied) offensively repping a shield ship with non shield reps is impossible unless their shields have already been ripped off enough for armor reps to actually apply.
---
On the flip side this also means that offensive repping would almost always work on armor ships, since they’re shields are gone anyway.
---
There are people willing to pay hard money for the big stuff. There are people interested in the game that do not even play the game when the big stuff gets blown. Not as much interested is shown when talking just about \~real PvP subcaps\~ however.  
---
Take that as you will.

I'm not a big fan of the current state of structure combat, even in null the larger structure based fights I've been in have been more tedium then 'fun' until we say 'screw the structure' and just enjoy brawling with the other groups.  But I've felt that way with pos warfare, dominion sov, etc.  
---
To be honest, I'm not entirely on the war HQ.  I'd have rather seen some sort of other structure not necessarily tied to the citidel reinforcement timers.  The concept I pitched was some sort of 'concord jamming array' that would serve as a replacement for the actual 'wardec' itself.  Fuel it with goods like starbase charters, online it, and that structure is now your wardec against a specific group.  
---
It gets blown up or runs out of fuel, wardec ends.  Could be a single reinforcement bit system like a pos, or small structure.  Something to give the implementation more wiggle room to tweak without having to screw with citadel mechanics.

---
worms have way too much tank and too much dps for a t1 frig to handle. The only scenario where I could see a torm beat a worm is if you catch a very lightly tanked, kiting worm and brawl it, even then you might need an armor plate fit or plate+rep because you'll still be eating its full dps which will easily break your saar.
---
With that said you only seem to only have gleam and aurora crystals, you need to carry something that will bridge the gap between the ranges that those 2 crystals offer. try multifrequency (about 7km optimal) and xray or ultraviolet (10-13km)
---
So Rorqs are going to be mining more then. 800m3/cycle is a lot more then the base 100m3/cycle they currently have.
---
Weren't both sides volleying titans at x47? With small groups of faxes/dreads to hunt/save dcs? Not sure how this changes the prep, just bring more titans like before.
---
They're going in the right direction though.  Make rorqs be strong in their command bursts.  Mining fleet variety should bring back a rorq with other ships around it.  
---
I do that in meetings at work all the time.
---
Clashing of the Freighters
---
The longer we wait, the longer the detroid crabbers are growing in strength!
---
Lol dude you need to chill out with the flair crusading. I specifically said I like the changes, my issue was with your math. From when I was mining 2 week fracks, conservatively 70% of those rocks were single Indy cycle or less. You sound like a dev screaming "260 MIL TICKS" backing everything up with outlier data.
---
You know that they still have 250% more health than a standard drone on any other ship right? In otherwords they will still be the tankiest medium drones on the market.
---
It was done so its more difficult to automatically recall heavy and medium drones back to drone bay when they start getting hit. The primary ratting VNI fits are 100 MN and quite fast doing a wide orbit, heavies won't be able to get back insdie quick enough and VNI will lose drones. Without drones it can't very well AFK rat or bot. Its a small change, but it will help.
---
Combined with a sig increase, and if they make some actual small changes to rat AI, together it will make a sizable dent. And they did say that PvE mobs are on the list and are getting reworked quite a bit, just didn't give a timeframe yet.
---
&gt; I don't understand your defeatist attitude.
---
I was out of isk, i was out of ships and modules i was camped into a station. I stopped logging in.
---
&gt;It's not meant to be easy, but it's far from impossible unlike the position you take on this.
---
I'm not saying that it's impossible. I'm saying that the position i was in made the game unfun to play.
---
There is one extremely big mistake, that makes the rest of what you do during a fight a waste.
---
A large majority of fights in this game are won before the first aggression. Your engagement profile is arguably as important or more important than everything and anything you do in a fight. A beam tormentor is going to struggle quite a bit versus a Worm, assuming it has a chance to win at all. Being beams, there was no chance of defanging him, you'd be hard pressed to track him. You really struggled to do much of anything to him, so this fight was lost when you engaged him.
---
If you had a friend, for example, warp in afterwards, your engagement profile as a duo expands because you have more DPS, you'll break harder tanks, and you'll last longer in fights and individually be safer. Would it kill a Worm if you had another friend there in a T1 frigate? Hard to say.
---
A Worm has the ability to effectively ignore range control due to using 2 tanky light drones for DPS. It'll hit just fine out to the long ranges, or in brawl range, the only thing it loses is rocket DPS if you have great range control over him, that's marginal.
---
Overall though, you did just fine as far as your PvP actions and ship management, just make sure you understand your engagement profile.
---
Redeemer at 500 m missing :)

Pretty cool though

No. It's a T2 ship. It's price is dictated by unchanged T2 manufacturing requirements while the supply of T2 materials has changed.

Dont know under which rock you living but olmeca is banned at least 2 times daily :)
---
Ok, here is my AAR.
---
As I read the title I thought “Why would a Tormentor, ANY Tormentor, fight a Worm?”. A Worm should never EVER lose a fight against a Tormentor. So, obviously, a Tormentor should never decide to stick to fight a Worm.  But, meh, watched first 2 seconds of video, noticed AB, scram and web, and again I pondered “How will you expect to even tackle it with that fit, he’ll kite you to death...”
---
But then I noticed it was low sec, so I concluded “Ah, low sec plex, hopes for Worm to land at 0 and that it has no tank at all. Might work, and Torm is dirt cheap”.  But then I saw you moving away of landing point, screamed at you for moving away, just knowing Worm would land outside your scram range. And why you have long range ammo, dude, you want him at close range, so use close range ammo, that Worm will never get close to...
---
OMFG, why is that Worm zeroing on you? Why he not pointing you, why you not running?!? CHANGEAMMONOWWTF, why that Worm has a scram? (I actually paused here to check your overview and see if there was any other hips there). Well, it does not matter, you dead now.
---
/end AAR.
---
Jokes aside, unless he lands at you at 0, and you manage to tackle him before he runs away (and he panics and takes a while to use his drones), I dont think you have a chance on winning that fight. Were you expecting him to be scram fit? Is that a normal fit in low sec?
---
If that were the case, we'd be finding nothing but large amounts of salt cached in Abyssal pockets, and the Triglavians would be avoiding the well-armed cruisers that show up in their front lawn in favor of unarmed industrialists and miners.

So, ice mining is generally better ISK/hr, at least as far as HS goes (moon mining probably is better in NS and LS). The Endurance is a cloaky ice mining ship, and the only frigate that can do so. It's primary purpose is to mine ice in C13 wormholes, that can only be acceded by frigates and porpises. It is also a potentially lower SP option to ice mine else ware, though a retriever with even T1 ice harvesters mines more and is cheaper. It is also useful for mining in LS and NS when you don't have control of the system, as you can easily get away from people dropping on you with your cloak. Tee cloak on an Endurance doesn't have the speed penalty it would have on other ships, so you can align and cloak, then de-cloak and warp away on the same tic.
---
That's what I've been thinking for the past four years, but really, when she hard committed to it, I was a nobody in terms of access, and there was zero indication I wouldn't stay as such.

welcome back to the welcome point then!

Fair enough. So fake asshole then. :D
---
Still, it does make you look like an ass to those that dont know that.
---
u/CCP_Falcon has stated that cloaking and local are seen as being closely connected, and that you can't nerf one without buffing the other. We are about as likely to see a nerf to cloaking as we are to see a nerf to local.

You understood nothing I said or are just purposefully trolling.

Make the hulltank dream reality pls
---
Not a bad thing
---
If you don't want to spend the isk on improving your ship, you can always invest it in the market. For example you can buy some skill books from an NPC sell order, them move them to a trade hub and mark them up 10-20%. The ISK per sale can be low, but there is always a demand and volume is repetitively high and it gives your ISK something to do while you're not using it. (This  particular example was nerfed by the most recent patch, but there are other possibilities as well.)  
---
Another option is to find something else in the game you want to do. 150mil will buy you a lot of T1 frigates to fly in faction warfare, or it could buy 2-3 T2 asteros that you could use both to explore and hunt other explorers. If you aren't interested in PvP you could buy implants for your exploring, start some PI, buy a L3 mission running ship. You could get a hawk that can run T1-2 abyss sites solo, or you could save a bit more and get a gila to run T3 sites.  
---
Finally, if exploring is your thing I'd highly recommend joining Signal Cartel. They are a corp focused entirely on exploration with a strict non-aggression policy. If you want to hunt as well as explore WiNGSPAN Delivery Services is another option. Do join a corp though, Eve is a game best enjoyed with other people, and it can give you a direction that you can save ISK towards.
---
FRT didn't, though. The war is postponed for another week
---
TEST would crash and burn if you removed our most powerful weapons platform tho
---
Excavators are ammo, not drones
---
Spinning a narrative to suit your needs is also not needed. Unless if you somehow can spin a generalized statement.
---
The initial post's nature doesn't change the truth in what I said.
---
Hoboleaqs: T2 cloaks now use fuel and remove pilot from local.
---
For a miracle to happen and all bots get removed. Also Wormholes need some love.. But The thing I want Most is for the Drifters to come threw in that massive fleet with the big capital ship of there's "the one that broke the server" And wipe out Player owned structures Randomly across EVE. It be like an eviction fleet that keeps on moving and keeps Corps on there tows..

The only thing I could see having a small chance of success is gimmick tanking his Hobs, if those are his go-to option. Trimarks, 400mm plate and double a-type thermal resists. Takes good fitting skills tho. Then camp the warpin with scram + double web. Those resist mods are cheap, I can give you a bunch if you want to try. 
---
never said you did, also they were probably crying for a reason - and very good pvpers at that. Now i think its much more enjoyable to solo pvp without falcons landing in each and every fight.

This change will not hurt those with the 12 rorquals.

It'll hurt people like me.
---
Because the distance to you isn't measured from your centre point.
---
"adapt or die" :smug:
---
Looks at potentially 800b of loot. Not those things through.
---
I see only one valid idea in your propsals/concerns, which is a combination of something you don't like and something you want.
---
Keep the war HQ but that specific structure has your watch listing agent/module and you can o my have one per alliance.
---
This way you can find out where your targets are and actually leave the trade hubs, but it is now at risk of the targets getting together and kicking your structure in.
---
Your alternative idea of having the war continue if you kill more than the defender will just lead to you being even further risk adverse, which frankly isn't what any one wants.
---
I have one proposal for you in addition. What if when you declare a war on a Corp that has positive standings with an NPC Corp, the aggressor cannot dock in those NPC stations... you know they like them and younddclared a war:)
---
Citadels, Citadels, Citadels. The fact that this further buffs no skill N+1 blobbing. Citadels, oh and. Citadels.

1. Holy Rental Empire - supercaps/caps/sub

* These guys might have a lot on the line long term. If the Russians retake the central east, eventually they are going to come for the dronelands. Although they are very skilled, a coalition of around 3k pvp characters will probably have a problem defending 300+ sov systems.

In short: yes, it was a scam.
---
You know what?  Seeing how long it now takes for the anoms to respawn, it will probably not matter at all if you clear the site and then keep sitting there for a bit waiting for the siege to finish it's cycle....
---
first of all im all for saving as many play styles as possible, we already lost so many. the ting i dont get is you keep using the term guerrilla tactics. in what way does pirat use guerrilla tactics?
---
I don't think this will change much.
---
If it does, Rorq multiboxers will probably just n+1.
---
What about the nerds that have been training forever to apply damage to subcaps in carriers of there own??? So now carriers will just be unused capital cannon fodder??? Who that doesn't have 30+ dudes is going to drop a couple of those small gang now, when all they'll do is get tackled unable to kill subcaps waiting for hostile dreads/supers to arrive.... If you can't defeat a carrier run away from it... This shouldn't be an issue Jesus. The butthurt is so strong.
---
I haven't played since around 2011-2012, but if that's comparable to 30 days play time, then it's cheaper than the 2.2-2.5 Billion a PLEX was going for back then.
---
But hey, they're finally restarting tiericide where they left off 5 years ago!  ZOMG CCP DA BESTESTESTT
---
I mean, its a pretty low bar.  If they stay on track and make changes like this every 3 years...EVE mighit be in a decent state in 2042?
---
Or, you know, they could stop being retarded and make them hard to multibox like people have been suggesting since the original rorq changes 3 years ago?  Even a hamfisted change like giving excavators a non-repeating fighter UI would work.  Bam, you can't realistically multibox more than 2-3 of them, little guy isn't boned, guy multiboxing 20 of them is.  ZOMG MUCH SMART MANY WOW
---
Sharkweek, baby.
---
Based and Triglav pilled.
---
Just wait for the next time that carrier get buffed.
---
 "The Deviant Automata must conform or be extirpated." may be the key here I suspect.
---
Is a rogue Triglavian faction hinted? 
---
The VNI "nerf" will have no effect at all on ratters.
---
Not to mention once we're at the scale that it matters, your biggest enemy isn't FAX, it's half of your damn dreadbomb not loading grid or guns not firing because CCP's server is in the process of eating shit by that point.
---
I know we say never not post, but that is on forums, not here.
---
I'm pretty sure plex was never this high before
---
We are the russians, we aint the good guys.
---
I had no idea it could cost you money like that, I'm sorry man.  I think when it impacts you personally and impacts your enjoyment of the reason you came to the sub in the first place it's time to look for a way out.  I respect that you don't want to just leave it hanging and get why you are trying to bring in new mods.
---
How are the new mods activity wise?  If it doesn't work out is it worth just putting the into the wild west and seeing who steps up when it catches fire?
---
It's alright Olmeca, we are all here to help you. No need to lash out.
---
I would describe it mostly as hit and run or evasive techniques that we use to catch and kill someone unsuspecting. Stuff like logoff traps are something we use from time to time as well. 
---
When we wardec some large Nullsec entity we don't realistically expect that we can win a traditional fight. So we don't play into their strength - we have to be annoying or difficult. What we can do is harass their members, catch their JF's, and much more. Does it have any meaningful effect? No, not to the Alliance or Corporation as a whole.. but ask that guy how he feels after he loses his hauler moving a Titan fit.
---
These tactics I describe as guerrilla tactics are more obvious and prevalent when we're talking about 2 Highsec PVP groups fighting. The group of players I'm with within Pirat come from VMG. We were directly responsible for killing a handful of other "Highsec Mercenaries" through the exact tactics I describe. Having killed so many groups like this, I know that fighting fire with fire is possible.
---
Thanks for the information. How hard is ice to find in Nullsec, and how hard are C13 wormholes to find? I assume they are the Shattered Wormhole type, can't remember if those were in when I was playing or not. 
---
Rolling breaks of local would be aan interesting intentional feeature
---
But everyone's already jumping for joy and acting like they're the BEST COMPANY EVER over these small changes that will probably be all we get this year.  Shows how low the bar is, and this community seems to be enablers.
---
When you look at a graph and it looks like it's from a super complicated science study but then it's eve online
---
Because they are often used as safe storage is wormholes, low sec, and null sec while the player is running a site, etc... 
---
It also makes failed drops that much more painful, and dreadbombing already has a pretty high fail rate due to the strength of faxes, which won't be affected by diminishing returns in those numbers.
---
I went for an interview a few years back

I don't get the idea that this is spearheaded by null sec alliances. I've been living in null sec on/off since 2006 and have never once been killed by the mechanics of high sec wars. That's despite being in alliances that were more or less permanently at war in high sec.
---
Yes you do catch people in null sec alliances who chose to risk themselves there, but mostly it was the new players that died in high sec to those decs. And then we'd teach them about out of alliance haulers, using jump clones to get skill books, and alliance logistics and it almost never happened a second time.
---
Most null sec alliances are more or less self sustaining, other than importing goods for t2 production or the t2 mods themselves (by out of alliance logistics).
---
If the null sec alliances have any stake in this it's because the game was losing players because of the high sec war dec mechanic (as CCP confirmed by their own metrics).
---
So essentially you're blaming the null sec powers for something that is entirely your own fault. You broke the game for so many new players that the game was literally unplayable for them and they quit entirely. 
---
Tl;dr: you reap what you sow.
---
New Eden used to be called Paradise in the history of the game.

Yep just make it so cloaks break after 30 minutes automatically or let them use idk 5 lo per minute or so 
---
&gt;With Plex prices what they are, an individual who derives most of their income from carrier or supercarrier ratting to continue to play will need to rat twice as much to continue even playing the game. Combined with the VNI nerfs this significantly impacts the ability of many players to continue playing in a game that already struggles with player retention.
---
Oh fuck off.
---
If you were able to make double digit billions to afford a super, you damn well know how to easily surpass the 65m/day threshold to plex your account. You probably do it passively from your reactions, manufacturing, pi, etc before you've even unlocked said super.

No one need a frigate player.

Yup, they will just increase rorq count and at the same time mineral prices will continue to fall. Meanwhile plex will go even faster up to support the n+1 of rorqs.

---
&gt;The Convocation of Triglav Outside the Struggle invoke Cladistic Proving. Glorification of the fit, and mortification of the unfit (???????) of the Flow.
---
Sounds to me like the Abyss pockets are a sort of proving grounds, where we are permitted to enter and see if we pass their tests. 
---
Perhaps if there is an event, there will be yet another gate at the end of Abyss sites, going to entirely new regions ....
---
Upvoted for discussion, but I won't venture to say that the recent movements are "good for EVE" - rather, it's the market doing its job. Where it's going to lead us is yet to be seen.
---
As a disclaimer, I have very limited knowledge of economics in general and, specifically, the market environments in EVE, but I'll try making my own assumptions.
---
The data on Evemarketer suggests that, as of today, we are in the aftermath of a large injection of new blood into the ratting/mining ecosystem. There clearly is ISK inflation, because all the key commodities have risen in price to some extent across the board. At the same time, there is overproduction of minerals, because everything T1 has fallen in price despite the ISK inflation - even in Jita, which largely has remained its own ecosystem due to the logistics involved in trading with nullsec.
---
Between Dec 31 and today, the average PLEX prices have risen by 17.7 percent, and skill extractor numbers are roughly the same, because their prices are directly tied to PLEX.
---
Skill injectors, however, are what reflects the value of SP - with a side of PLEX value, of course. Until November 2018, the prices were mostly flat with a downward trend. In mid-November, there must have been a big injecting buzz - probably, a lot of new nullsec krabs/botters scaling their production. The rise continued throughout the holidays, then a big drop, then growth again, but a bit less steep.
---
The thing with SP is that they're an investment tool for krabs. Every new injected krab alt starts as an SP consumer only to become a net producer in the long run. Back when everyone and their mother were injecting like mad, there  were entire specialized SP farms, because plexing and extracting alts would net you a profit. Right now, extracting a character with perfect attributes every month puts you 5-10 percent in the red, so SP farmers are out of the equation for now, and extracting is now the privilege of farming multiboxers and botters, who don't need to train skills any further. The net loss is compensated by their farming, so they see no reason not to continue.
---
The PLEX prices might see a decrease with the upcoming patch as people return to the game to see what's new. An, maybe, a PLEX sale.
---
Apparently you might just be getting your gate to stain, but with quite a few very, very angry triglavians to go along with it :P
---
I bet you would really like the improved locators
---
Awesome !! 
---
Oh yeah, since when were Excavators a base mining yield of 1000m3?  Someone should really look at the tool tip.  I'm looking at it right now and it says 100m3
---
Reminds me of [this legendary thread](/r/Eve/comments/25kusi/nsfw_sharing_eve_with_your_significant_other/)
---
Mmh. I am curious how it will go the first few months. Will especially with their new neighbors. 
---
:-) 
---
Yeah each 100m added to plex is 1h farming for me, yeah the game is cool but I don't want to have to spend 60$ each month which is equivalent to a brand new game for sub or spending more and more time to not have to pay.
---
I'm impress on the inflation rate
---
How about bosons damage being tied to sig radius... kindof like how missiles work. Stop the solo boson camps on many gates in delve/eso and require like idk 5 titans (numbers can ofc change) to boson a whole HAC fleet. Imo that’s almost as much of an issue as HAW guns on titans... could even buff single target DD titans if you wanted to compensate for nerfing boson

Pseudo science. Proper model is surely not a 4th degree polynomial. It doesn't make any sense to normalise by hit type. Have a look at the original graph. You can clearly see the linear ramp up in about the first minute by following the peaks. After that it's constant. From 1:52:30 to 1:53:20 is your transversal bad/high. You are actually missing at least one hit. (right after the orange/glances off line stops.) That miss would probably have been a penetrate or smash. In your final ghraph you actually take out that information.  
---
What is actually a nice idea is to plot the damage and code the hit types. Simple dots, triangles, squares (maybe with color) would be better than lines though.
---
Imagine being this retarded.

No you daft cunt, you are called mentally unstable for your hilariouslybad victim complex and obsession with goons

Sometimes people don't like to share their hobbies and just mention the boring things.  
---
I noticed this when I had a few applications on my desk. It's quite common in Germany that you mention a few of your hobbies/activities in your CV. Most people just write "normal &amp; flippy" things like Reading, Music, Sports etc. just to hide that they're doing "nerdy" things like being Clan leader in a MMORPG guild/corporation or hunting orcs at the weekendes as Earindil, the elven-prince from Duskwood in a 10.000 people LARP like 'Mythodea'.
---
Flashback :)
---
No, you're misunderstanding what the damage modifier means.
---
1.26 comes from (1+0.26) and corresponds to a 26% damage bonus. This is how all Eve stacking is done for calculations. For example cargo bay on a freighter:
---
 baseCapacity*(1+0.05*freighterSkill)*(1+0.279)^3 
---
For a freighter with 3x t2 expanders. (Numbers may not correspond to in game numbers, I can't check what the actual values are right now nor do I remember what the freighter skill multiplier is).
---
That 1.26x number is generated by not showing the full formula. If it were 0.68, that number would correspond to much worse than a 50% nerf. Think:
---
100*0.68=68
---
Vs
---
100*(1+0.68)=168
---
Why the hell would you do that when you can run L5s in a carrier and make 10x the isk ?

It is not a bug. It happened to me several times. Itțs very rare. They activate the proving gate while you only have under 5 seconds left on timer inside arena. It takes few seconds for them into the warp tunnel to get inside arena while your arena cloak reaches 0 and opens the gate.

Funny how if you google "guerilla warfare" the definition you get is "engagement in or the activities involved in a war fought by small groups of irregular soldiers against typically larger regular forces". Now show us where banking haulers and running from any resistance unless you outnumber them 3:1 is guerilla tactics. If anything, the people who come out to fight you are engaging in guerilla. You on the other hand, are just a risk averse, arrogant little shit, who even shamelessly admits to being such as if it's a good thing.

Some of the ISD lads really don’t like it when someone posts requests for.. anything really. It’s understandable that you ask in te ‘rookie help’ channel to be helped with your site, unfortunately it’s prohibited to do so. Next time you require any help with running sites or anything like that, shoot me a mail in game (Darum Rinah) I play very often and mostly in EU timezone. Would happily help a rookie out. (You can keep all the loot for yourself ofcourse).
---
You say fuck over, I say force other rorqs to go elsewhere, which is the goal
---
Yeah the wrecking shot multiplier on one gun is dope. Had a 25k volly when shooting a citadel once
---
/u/ccp_falcon how about you guys actually focus on fixing to fucking issues with eve first before making stupid and unnecessary balance changes (which are actually major nerfs) ??? Like fix broken local which you've made no announcement on today?
---
Shield slave set for only 1750 Plex in the first week after its release, plus an amazing special skin for your Rorqual. -And not to forget the special Pearl Abyss underwear for your character, just in case you shit yourself because it's so cool. 
---
Out of curiosity where would you draw the line there?
---
Should all drones operate on fighter mechanics? Should all mining lasers and excavators have to be reset each cycle?
---
Should actions like orbit and keep at range have to be reactivated every few minutes?
---
As someone who uses multiple rorquals I honestly have no issues with cloaky camping, having a threat that could come at you at any time is good for the game. Your opportunity for counterplay comes at the same time as when they make an aggressive play and that’s fine.

Triglavian is not down with the CCP Crew
---
I've literally never said that.
---
I have no issue with AFK cloaking personally, people just need to grow a pair and stop being afraid of something they can't see.
---
On local, if it was up to me, I'd separate the intelligence system from it, making it a system that needs active player input to stay up to date, and delete local completely.
---
Stop touching my furry weeb!
---
Shield slaves would be too OP given that shield caps are already more tanky than armour caps. I would rather want to see shield recharge implant set and X-Large Shield Extenders, considering that nobody uses buffer-tanked shield battleships as EHP increase from Large Shield Extenders is too insignificant to make them worth putting on a battleship.
---
Scan res implant set would be nice if it wouldn't make PIRAT losers camping tradehubs even more cancerous.
---
But no implant set
---
Making cloaks use fuel is a silly idea.
---
It would be on the same level as giving carriers and supercarriers ammunition holds, and forcing fighters to reload off stacks of ammo. Yes, it's realistic. No, it's not fun.
---
The only thing that is frustrating is 50 multiboxed, 24-hour-afk cloaky ships that you cannot hunt.
---
If there were probes that appeared on dscan and took a full minute to scan down a cloaky signature, that would be enough.
---
But it will never happen.
---
Oh look there is a typo in the title. Besides why would I care to spell the name of some SaltyBoi right?
---
Triglavians free Stain from Sansha and install a lowsec gate?

Oh my this is adorable

Suck shit.
---
Tbh I wouldn’t mind that - it enhances their role as a cap hunter whilst not making them too good in fleet pvp (generally you don’t run CovOps for small gang unless you are running around WHs)
---
Will do.
---
Good.
---
Lower anomaly spawn rate also translates to more tank as no reason to put hyperspatials.            
---
You can also get tank related implants.

TBH we will see what turbocrabs will come out with - but i guess they will surprise everyone.

Smaller groups neither make their income with super-ratting nor defend their space with one. It will get tackled or baited and dropped on because smaller groups don‘t have a supercap umbrella with infinite FAXes to help out.
---
It‘s a good and overdue change and first step into the right direction. 
---
I think you are missing the point here.            
---
Playing eve and being space nerd don't translate to your actions and how you behave in RL.       
---
Also how rare are C4's with C4/C3 statics.
---
http://anoik.is/systems?systemclass=c4&amp;staticdest=c3,c4&amp;effect=_unfiltered&amp;shattered=_any_non
---
Why are you apologizing for being risk averse when null-sec exists? lmao
---
Are you going to be living solo or are you going to have people to live with? If the latter then having a C4/C3 would probably be better for you. If you are worried about C5 space I think the chances are more likely that you would be evicted by a C4 entity over a C5 entity (If you live in a C4) especially if you have your citadels set to RU/EUtz.
---
There are 64 habitable (non-shattered) C4-C5/C4s 
---
There are 97 habitable (non-shattered) C4-C4/C3s
---
For an individual, particularly one new to j-space, C3 static ISK earning power is comparable to a C5 because the ISK/ehp of the NPCs is similar. ISK density is obviously a lot worse in a C3 so you'll need more sites to compensate. But another trade-off is that you can run the sites in a solo Gila or similar, rather than the heavier options for C5 space. 
---
In terms of PvP, C5 space is not bustling by any means. There are no more than 15 active groups that focus on PvP (probably more like 10) in the space and 531 systems in the class. So I can guarantee it won't be some torrent of content. 
---
There are other, more practical things to consider. C4 space never has wandering k-space connections. So having your home and one of your statics as that means generally longer chains to find a logistics connection. The C5 static wormhole from a C4 (H900) is a 3b mass hole, whereas all the other connections you're considering are 2b mass holes. On the one hand you have more mass to work with in terms of bringing fleets through, but on the other it is more work to roll the connection to look for better content. A 2b hole can be closed with 4 rolling battleship passes, a 3b hole requires 5-6 depending on variation. 
---
Living in j-space is hard work, and I would never personally recommend someone to try and do their own solo thing. Find a corp, they'll help you learn, split the work of scanning and maintaining infrastructure and have fun together.

I feel the lower insurance payout shouldn't apply to dreads. Let's be honest, dreads are basically stationary big guns you don't expect to bring back home anyway, and if you want to see more dreads around there's no point in making them cost more after insurance.
---
Anyone has some kind of thoughts how carriers nerf gonna impact it's tick ?
---
Since we're getting around 50mil ISK per tick in a Niddy, after those changes we will be hitting ~40-ish since frigates will take forever to kill.
---
You can improve yourself by getting more dps crystal, for example multifrequency and getting drugs like standard exile booster, and hardshell.
---
But actually, proper fit and skill worm can’t lose against T1 frigs.
---
If you want to win against Worm in T1 frig, check worm’s fit and skill is shit or not. If they are shit, you’ll have a chance.
---
I thought omen Navys were a meme just because lmao EM damage until I flew one and holy shit it's good anti tackle

Say what?

No one is safe. Furries on all sides.

Predatory metagaming btw

I've actually got a Vanilla C4 C4/C3 hole for sale with structures up if that helps with the decision. We moved out because of lack of meaningful content
---
That's pretty legit lol
---
kek
---
cloaky camper takes cloaked dst
---
You might also drop a mobile tractor unit before you start shooting ;)
---
Soooo you're complaining that a guy is cloaked up in your space, not going after active ratting ships, and the one time he went after a rorqual he got got? 
---
I'm not seeing a problem here.
---
Look lovingly at this now. With all the cap changes there will be far less targets to hunt.  
---
Is it really inevitable that Legacy and FRT will fight?Personally, I think our goal should be Imperium.This is a very huge existence.
---
I think that the "for the newbros" argument shouldn't be discarded given the impact wars have on retention
---
Best country in the world so far !

wtb tiamat 20.1b

&gt;Risk averse fuck from shit tier alliance complains about changes that add a small layer of risk to his gameplay.
---
Ok...
---
They need add 1 or 2 extenders in lowslots, or use a blockade runner to pickup those.     
---
Not much is changing, except for excavator price.       
---
well if you are allies to bastion it will be crap as you will need to save them alot. if you are enemies well then lots of fun bet.
---
the worst 
---
Hodor
---
So why even hold sov and risk trillions in assets?
---
Hodor! Hodor! 
---
You post me when you told me what I fundementally hate.
---
maybe even sooner seems there are more corps looking for a new home. to give you an idea of who might be leaving look at Zkill, the corps that used to perform previous months and then this month they are not. shows you how dedicated the members are. with bastion loosing already some of the best corps do you really think the corps that have been slacking all this time is going to build themselves up. Dont think so bastion will serve the Imperium better as renters at this point  
---
Yeah it s funny. I was in a small village when i started eve. I met some icelander ig. One was of my village he never wanted to say me who he was lol. 
---
Fuck right off.
---
&gt;It doesn't make any sense to normalise by hit type
---
And that 's when I realized you have no idea what you're talking about 
---
IKR. Just perfect for the job.
---
Why is fighter ammo holds not yet a thing?
---
It's a game where a bunch of assholes play together shooting at other assholes because somebody called them an asshole.
---
A ticking bomb in the room is clearly a threat, what the fuck are you even talking about?
---
I mean, I get your point, but your example sucks.
---
That is probably the most Slavic ship ever. I must have it 
---
i will (not) approve this
---
Really the tourism here has really nothing to share with Eve. It s just the landscape :)
---
Try to guess why shadow serpentis sensor booster went up in price 3x over 2 days. 
---
I can neither confirm nor deny 
---
Slow them down a bit but I think they can get only higher. It's supply vs demand, to lower prices supply would have to be bigger and it means usually new players. 
---
Stop being a nullsec crab, change my mind.
---
Well, just made sure that my 3 accounts are unsubbed. Super Ratting was the last thing I do in Eve. Also thought about getting a ratting Titan just for the fun. But that got nerfed too. So long and thanks for all the fish
---
I don't share your opinions but have to thank you for this detailed write up. Sadly reddit is a very bad place for a proper discussion. People downvote your post because they don't share your opinion. Last time it was still positive it was 2 up and 52% upvote now it's at 48 upvote. I might later answer you with my opinions, but first I had to say that it's a shame that minority opinions aren't heard.
---
You send some well tanked VNIs to do anoms, form a response fleet of your choosing and wait to see if he is afk or not; if after some time nothing happens everyone goes on with their activities but keep some people ready to respond anyway just in case, if he attacks you make sure he understands that hitting you was a bad idea.
---
After some time you can even figure which campers are a threat and which ones aren't (use a spreadsheet).
---
What if the camper isnt after vnis 
---
I think you missed the part where it said 'Interceptors'. So there's no 500 man titan fleets hiding in safe spots
---
And the rule 34 countdown beings.
---
My shitposting skills are in a dire need of an overhaul, I'll have to agree
---
I'd say you don't need much familiarity with EVE but it requires an interest in EVE. Great book.
---
Hey hit up "nornheim" ingamewith a mail, i can give a few pointers and enjoy helping newbros
---
Maybe they will add more agents.

Jump on the spectre fleet in game channel and join a public pvp fleet. We are newbro friendly and kill everything and everyone for the lulz.

Worm is completely broken and puts out facemelting, unavoidable, blaster level dps from 0 to 35mm perfectly while sporting the best tank of the entire novice frigate lineup.
---
It is essentially unfightable with t1 frigs and dunks most faction and pirate frogs as well.
---
Don’t fight it.
---
The in game representation would support this.
---
If you plot a route in normal space (longer LY distance better) you can see the jump gate lines in distance even in W-space.
---
I think you can even see the coordinates of W-space systems in same way as normal space systems.
---
But both of these could be just due to some dev deciding it would be too much work to create a new separate space for wormholes back in the day.
---
Would be better if you are flying a Drake. 
---
Honestly I don't care about downvotes.
---
The thing I'm most concerned is that CCP listen only to a bunch of people that consider themself "elite pvp" ignoring the vast majority of the player base who really enjoy rorqual mining.
---
For those rorqual opened a lot of opportunities that in past were available only to extreme multiboxers.
---
But CCP don't care about us, they prefer to fall into the actual narrative: "if you're not a pvp enthusiast you're a botter or at least a krabber to punish" 
---
Not what i said at all but ok. I didnt say anything about eve dying. I just said WTM is the largest incursion community and its not even close to dying like TVP has
---
Crap, I didn’t know that was an only-in-EVE thing.
---
&gt;logi
---
Makes me feel good. I've been practicing as logi anchor for the past few months 
---
I don't think it's possible. 
---
&gt;As the guy who sat with you in local
---
I was trying to convince someone to wait on the hole just to pop you when you came through to get eyes. I was the guy posting propaganda in local btw 
---
"Hisec pvp" is a joke. Come to lowsec with your blingy miner-shooting ships, i promise it will sting just a little.
---
Personally id rather spent the money on eve than yet another dissapointung aaa game.
---
&gt;  Super Ratting was the last thing I do in Eve.
---
Wait you were unironically enjoying super ratting ?
---
 I am former EVE University member and I know how you and other wardeccers operate. I laughed the part you said "if you want to fight us, catch us". It is hard to catch while you are running away like there is no tomorrow :) Most of PIRAT excels in Trade Hub and Hub Gate camping and nothing else and they use at least 2-3 out of corp alts to ensure victory (scouts and ooc logi) against a industrial or a pve ship. But you run away with the any sign of capable pvp ship/fleet that may counter you or you simply dock and refuse to take the fight. So in other words your suggestion 
---
 
---
&gt;Alliance **“A”** declares war on corp **“B”**. The war goes on for (1) week and the aggressor kills more in ISK than the defender. The war is allowed to continue as long as it’s paid for and the war report will be examined weekly to see if the defender has come back and surpassed the aggressor. If that happens, then see below for a similar conclusion…  
---
&gt;Alliance **“A”** declares war on corp **“B”**. The war goes on for (1) week and the defender kills more in ISK than the aggressor. The war ends because the defender was victorious and they are immune from a wardec from that specific aggressor for (2) weeks.
---
simply not good since you continue camping gates and trade hubs to kill newbros, haulers and etc easily while other have to put a lot of effort to hunt you down. Instead I have a better proposal, wars with defined objectives. Each time you declare war you have to define a goa and if aggressor cannot meet the goals war drops and 2 weeks of non aggresion will be followed. Objectives can be. Same applies if defender meets their own objectives; which will be lower then aggressor objective logically.
---
Structures are there not only for removing your risk averse methods but to force you put some effort for real wars.
---
We are practically certain that "Deviant Automata" means Rogue Drones.
---
The DAV datastreams indicated that one of the clades thinks Deviant Automata are good, one of them thinks that they are bad (and set up deviant automata supressor towers) while the third has not decided yet. So as a whole the Triglavians have not decided on what to do with them.
---
Uh... scared now
---
and hardbass, of course.
---
Yea I was playing doom when the first ping went out and hopped on. I thought it was the normal we have like 10 dudes they have like 0 dudes, but then they needed logi to ge the leshes out. Warped to the fleet with no prior knowledge of just how many dudes we were against. 
---
Please do, one less Rorq in the game can only be a good thing.
---
I don't trust you, but I have nothing to lose, so OK, I will do that ;-)  Thanks.
---
Yeah. It had some "meditative quality" to it. Watch Netflix on another Monitor and just grind stupidly. Did pretty much nothing else in the game anymore. 
---
Even just that is fine.
---
You completely ignored the morale noctis and my heroic voyage through a crit chain to ninja loot the can and wrecks 
---
olmeca stop posting trash on reddit alts
---
Gotta agree on the rorq thing. It's very much a sympton of infinite ressources available, and the sheer scaleability they provide. 
---
But ofc it's less ressource intensive on the developer time, to do a simple number tuning. That is very very typical of CCP.
---
Can't fix the problem if they don't fix the core issues.... 
---
Rogue drones must conform eh? Looks like the Trig may be coming to the drone lands boys
---
cloak camping not a issue
---
even that just fine
---
calm down miner i dont see you in o-p doing fleets
---
&gt; people will tell you to join brave or horde or karma or whatever.
---
And they're right.  I'm not too familiar with Eve University these days, but they have a good reputation and are likely a fine choice as well.
---
A larger group has a bunch of benefits that are really useful as a new player.  First, when you get into fleet fights, there are enough people on your side that you tend not to die immediately.  Second, the large groups are usually pretty experienced at teaching new players and are generally pretty good at answering questions and guiding you down a decent path.  They'll generally have recommended training plans, free skillbooks, and will essentially give you a guided tour of a good portion of the game.  Third, nullsec isn't that scary when you learn how to not get caught, and that's not terribly hard to learn.  Fourth, absolutely more isk than high sec.  Fifth, the larger groups send out notifications about fleets starting at all hours of the day, so it's real easy to go get into PvP.
---
It tends to be easier to go from larger group to smaller group than vice versa.  If you're in Brave Newbies or Dreddit(TEST) or wherever and you decide to go join a wormhole group or do faction warfare, no one is going to hold that against you.  And finding a good smaller corp can be difficult without being able to rely on the reputation of the larger groups.
---
But if you want to go somewhere else, that's fine.  Just if you get frustrated or bored with whatever you're going, go and give one of the large groups a try.  You can always leave if/when it's not your thing and you know the basics of the game.  I'm of the opinion that you learn the basics and what fleets and organizations should look like generally much faster in the larger groups.
---
Too many players want a small, tight-knit group and end up in a high sec slave corporation where the leaders just use the newbie miners/ratters for a pathetic amount of taxes until they leave the game.  Or a group with no focus that doesn't *do* anything and only has a few dudes in each time zone who are pretty much never doing the same thing.  And it's hard to tell if you're in a bad corp that doesn't know what the fuck they're doing if you've never been in a decent corp/alliance.
---
http://dredditisrecruiting.com/ but also Brave, KarmaFleet (goons), Pandemic Horde, and Eve University are all fine choices.
---
You can live outside super umbrella and not feed too much. Look init.
---
2012, when i started, had plex between 600 and 700M iirc.
---
 Maybe they will change how to get them.
---
Well, I can't say with certainty that this is incorrect. My impression of the situation was as I stated. But, perhaps you know better. Were you among the leadership that night? Are you confirming, therefore that this situation did indeed take place?
---
the thing is you guys got a brain, the ones in bastion with brains have already left the alliance or are not moving to fountain 
---
Call the inquisition
---
Time for exterminatus
---
Stars no longer look like this, you need to update it. 
---
So, you DO think it is a good idea to kick people from fleet for a ship name of "LGBT" or similar?
---
Yep, it's the only way to win.
---
I quit playing about 4 years ago or so now and don't regret it. Had a lot of fun but no real desire to go back. 
---
you cant beat a worm in a tormentor dude. like, close to 0% chance: he needs to be afk or - arguably -  disconnect, or else ur toast.
---
Around 2007, a 30-day Game Time Card (GTC) was about 300M.
---
thats one way to adapt
---
Lol, they too are part of the Fountain Feeder Federation.
---
Great arguments for why this is a good change. Very cool. 
---
Saving people are fun too ;)
---
So you just want to grind, tell me again what's the issue is with this patch ? You will get slightly lesser tick, or will have to sacrifice some tank for tracing mids ? And you will be in danger for like a full minute max if you see report of neuts in local / intel, what a shame, you won't as before.
---
In fucking Eve Online.
---
Wouldn't it be more appropriate to just remove insurance from capital ships? Or at least remove it from Titans and motherships.
---
One thing I've pondered is if you should receive insurance at all if you die in nullsec. It's nullsec. Why would insurers pay out to someone who risks their ship by operating in zero security space?
---
Do you know that this is, without a hint of sarcasm, the actual, literal truth?
---
I got shot at for calling the asshole who shot my first Hulk an asshole [I dropped a can in the belt, calling the can ‘asshole’, and he came back and shot at me.
---
/I’m not beyond being an asshole myself.

I have rarely read a truer statement here than this one. It is the actual truth.
---
well then make way init, the new feeders are in town, we will show you noobies how its done 
---
I was going to say one step at a time but they just climbed like half the staircase in a row, so might want to give them a bit of time here.
---
I can definitely see that if you were bombarded with it the live long day, that would get old really fast.
---
Miramar Air Force base, where ‘Top Gun’ ostensibly plays, has a $5 Dollar per infraction fine for every reference to Top Gun. I can easily see why.
---
A bigger nerf to the PANIC module for rorq would was required imo. Needed to be 50%.
---
An invulnerability module should not exist at all really.
---
Or all but four are...
---
I'm guessing they'll stick to their usual approach. Implement the change now, watch the resulting carnage for a couple of years, and then try to improve the situation in a series of small incremental changes over another few years.
---
Yes, you will finally be able to afford all the crap you need

Get a loki and roam null, be happy when all the miners and ratters keep docking up.
---
Revel in all the income lost because of you just being there.
---
And ofc gank anything you can.
---
They free Stain from Sansha an turn Stain into Lowsec, thus every gate in Stain will be a lowsec gate for Stain.
---
They should add for NSA also ability to prevent lighting cyno
---
People cried for freighter fittings.
---
Look what happened.
---
Shield slaves are no different.
---
&gt; Sansha relic sites will no longer drop intact armor plates that will be moved to Blood Raider relics. 
---
Is this true?
---
*shrugs in wormhole*
---
Piscatorial exploitation is not tolerated!
---
I would trade booshing drone against either the tank nerf or the drone volume and we got both and a small PANIC nerf.
---
This particular bottle was bought when my local store had it with 20% discount, actually I'm trying it first time here. Still not sure if I'll buy second one.
---
nice
---
Since no one here gave any advice beyond not taking the fight (who cares your in a t1) ill nitpick.
---
1. Always have your repper heated, it repairs more per cycle (meaning you get more out of every paste) and has a faster cycle time (meaning you repair more often)
---
2. Pre-overheat stuff like prop mod,tackle and guns before the fight, a lot of encounters are based upon range.
---
3. Why are you running your ab before hes landed, its wasting cap which can be vital in keeping you alive and running and lowers your agility, meaning your ship will take longer to align to points or approach someone.
---
4. carry more ammo types, lasers can swap ammo instantly, abuse that

I great slogan for EVE Ads "**Discover your new lows**"
---
Lol? Why?
---
One per anom would be a bit of a nerf, 5 might be interesting. They can't perma panic ever though, panic burns out at one use. At most you could perma panic a group of small mining ships. Rorq panic does not work on other rorqs :)   
---
VNI Gila are being nerfed anyway so i imagine won't see ratting as much, it is more the AFK nature of drone boats though since ratting is by nature, boring. Super ratting is the most active in terms of interaction. 
---
Looks like you can if they are on a titan lmao

No rorq nor titan in picture.

---
Not really, you can archive 540 w/ rage assault misslies and heat with 2x T2 BCU, the fitting you need to do to archive that are always gimped on CPU, so this buff enables a wider range of fits to make without fancy implants or some weird faction Co-Processor.
---
Assuming what he's saying is true then yeah i5 would make sense. Sansha ships are shield tank, it never made much sense for them to be dropping armor loot.
---
However I don't think salvage and loot tables were mentioned in the shield slaves announcement, so I'm hesitant to believe they're gonna completely refuckulate loot tables and not just move the implants around in LP stores. It's a fair extrapolation of their reasoning for the switch, but it's CCP we're talking about here, one thing at a time :)
---
Somehow related: do nullsec blocs keep each other wardecced too? it would make sense, i think that the war should extend into hisec too.
---

I guess I understand why you might feel this way tho..

used to be able to scoop them with the booshers i believe

&gt;it never made much sense for them to be dropping armor loot.

In non giant umbrealla regions, which is the problem. It doesnt hurt huge corps exporting the most minerals. 
---
In comparison to other BC's with their respective standard fits it's not to bad Imo, ofc application plays a role, but assault misslies ar made for brawling anyways, so the low range isnt' that bad.

WH's are fantastic and super safe, don't worry, there's *totally* no one cloaked 10km away from you waiting for you to slip up and make a mistake.
---
Hey! Me to :). From a noob to a fellow noob. ( we noobros ) #fistpump.
---
I can tell you about wormholes. Iv been living in them since entering the Eve universe. I think I tallied about 30 ships lost. But with one goal in mind ( win some wormhole experience) I can give you a ship fit that I have been using and it is cheap. 
---
Don't do what I did and buy Asteros and WotNot. And lose them to lost probes and self destruct, bubbles from sabres, general ganking from ending up in NullSec wormhole exit campers. Try my cheap fit.
---
For example. You can buy this ship 60 times over in one night of relic/data site hacking. If you lose it , no big deal. Go for astero or something shiny later.

Dude I'm armor tanked and haven't been caught in my astero in months 
---
i didn't biomass but i did quit and this change ain't close to near enough for me to come back. 
---
people who still play eve look fucking stupid from where i'm sitting 
---
speaking as a small/mid sized gang player mostly 
---
Oh no whatchu gonna do with 4 levels of capital industrial ships now?
---
Usually in military communication, you use tac instead of dash.
---
So I've been told at least.
---
It's not. Most former and current members of the military will use "tac" instead of "dash".
---
wher btw.
---
&gt; since null alliances spend most of their time prepping
---
I wouldn't say most of our time, but it's certainly our primary concern, yeah.  If you can't win these battles, you don't own space for long.
---
Upvoting as a former wardeccer. I don't have time to read but it is long and formatted, so it should have a few good points in it.
---

---
Eh?
---
Isn't that Ken Ashcorp's mascot?
---
You do the same with a carrier... are you stupid?
---
That would be quite a hit to Relics in Providence and quite a boost to them in Delve.
---
shitposting on r/eve is one of the best ways to play eve 
---
We in Test Alliance Please Ignore value very highly honor, honesty and morality. Unlike all the shitheads out there we only fight to defend ourselves and be known by everyone as the good guys. Fraternity be warned, we’ve already fought against all of Eve once and won, if they want the same treatment we will gladly do it again.
---
It is almost 3km, problem is that when you anchor you have quite bad control of where, so it sounds like hell to actually do it....  and defenetly more effort than the avarage spodbrain is willing to do.
---
I didn't get it in all of my alts :(
---
Yes, I missed the Rogue Drones! Thanks!
---
So how do we pick sides is the issue then. Are they going to do incursions and then capsuleers are going to pick sides in the incursion fight? That would be interesting :)
---
One more thing, the scariest part is hauling your loot back to sell it, be quick, set your destination once you resurface from your hole and zip back quickly, sometimes selecting celestial objects in space and warping to them between gates changes your warp path and you dont get caught in those shifty gankers set up in the warp path.
---
That moment you finally get back to base with a weeks worth of loot from wormholes to sell is amazing..   
---
Are you high or something? With nsa changes there is gonna be even more dead caps...
---
surprise, CCP fucked this up aswell
---
Remote reps and cap transfer will get diminishing returns. HAW Titian’s get FPS cut in half.  Light fighter application nerfed. Unable to warp while your NSA is on. Rorq’s tank cut by 50/40% t1 / t2, PANIC time shortened, excavator drone nerfed 20%, and the excavator being larger so only 3 fit in a wetu.   But no changes to combat cloaky campers.  Everyone complains about this turning into caps online. So they are getting the changes they are crying for and it make the super capital class of ships not a wise choice of ships to use for anything.

Imagine Triglavian fleets invade hisec systems and wormholes to wave wars against Sansha Incursions, Rogue Drones and Sleepers and capsuleers can pick a side and align themselves in these battles for LP and such :)
---
you had to be omega before march 20 
---
[deleted]
---
Extract them
---
just bring more ships dude lol
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one
---
Pretty much. 
---
&gt; most titans are HAW titans it seems
---
They're not.  You can even hit battleships with long range dread guns.
---
Who?
---
You had to be Omega on March 20th.
---
These skillpoints are being issued specifically for the service interruptions and extended unscheduled downtimes on the day of deployment.
---
Dont get me wrong free sp is good, but why did we get it? Cant find any post or anything
---
 &gt;next month CCP gives 500k SP to compensate bad chat servers again for all omega accounts who were subbed tomorrow
---
Sweet Jesus.
---
Maybe it is time to update your believes about EVE University since EVE Uni is not the same corporation once it used to be ( I did not know those times as well but I heard stories about strict WSOP rules). EVE UNI may be neutral and pasifist but I can asure you they can defend themselves and do counter offensives succesfully.
---
Boosh fleets are one of the few ways you can fight when massively outformed. Removing the ability to do so won't create more brawls, it will just mean that the fleet won't undock and come to the fight in the first place.
---
yeah, i have 3 accounts that run a 3 month abo for close to 2 years now, only one acc got the SP.
---
Cringe
---
Maybe u look at ur fratpings and you will have an idea where the tidi is coming from :) 
---
&gt; These guys might have a lot on the line long term
---
yeah the hre  guys are likely to qq unsub if they lose 300+ sov systems
---
Ironically, the news system is down right now so I can't publish news - our web team is working on it :P
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pocsim/skillpoint-compensation-delivered-for-chat-system-issues?origin=launcher
---
You should take your eyes off that spod roid more often
---
Firstly you are not wrong in ticks and am not arguing that. But secondly super/carreirs should simply not be able to rat in any way, that's just causing a lot of economic issues across the board.
---
Thanks to skillinjectors there are superpilots which their only knowledge is to rat and I do believe that's very wrong.
---
That's just cripling actual game, but that's just my opinion and anyone can have different.
---
And indeed there are people autistic enought to superrat, but god that clickfest is fucking horrible.
---
Very good explanation, but you also forgot to mention the outright fucked part of the meta modules. Sometimes a m3 would be better than a m4 and often the m4 would be better than the T2 in not only fitting and drawbacks, but just overall...  It was a hot mess for certain modules, making it a system that pretty much only people who spent hours in EFT fully knew about.
---
So I definitely shouldn't sign my work emails with o7? I'm pretty close to trying it and seeing what happens.
---
Hundreds of players made CCP aware in the forums that people who had been affected in the *nine months* following March were being left uncompensated. Nice to see the response has been the equivalent of "tHe LoGs sHow nOtHinG".
---
Let me tell you about our lord and saviour EVE Online
---
I had 3 accounts Omega, not a single one got the SP
---
Gg falcon GG
---
I like the lorem ipsum part though
---
Same... 
---
What about the 9 months after March 20th? I wasn't subbed that day but I have been affected like everybody else. Seems like giving out 500k SP wasn't very thought out.
---
Maybe it's because of powermad assholes like you who let arbitrary positions of "power" get to their heads?
---
you might mod the subreddit, you're still just a janitor. Elsewhere in this thread, here, to be precise:
---
&gt;  it's all of the people with something interesting to say or a story to tell just up and quit the game. 
---
the moment you arbitrarily decided that you are allowed to arbitrarily designate what is or isnt "interesting" instead of leaving it to the users, who are supposed to do so, the sub went to shit. 
---
This is 100% on you and nobody else. 
---
You need to step down before you ruin r/eve further.
---
This used to be the **BEST** place to come to get a - with a dose of ~narrative~ - good look at the machinations and workings of the game. 
---
Now, it's a shitfest circlejerk populated entirely by the kind of thing you and your shitheels find funny, and wonder why it's dying? Maybe it's because you dicks aren't the cultural arbiters you seem to have decided you get to be? Maybe if you look around and only ever encounter assholes, it's not everyone else that's the problem, it's **you**. 
---
No one takes the insurance on motherships and titans , its a huge joke. 1.6b for 5.4 payout for motherships
---
Thanks for posting, and sorry for the salt ;P
---
I had 7 Omegas at that time, only 2 received the SP. Does the allocation take time?
---
That would make sense, but the TIDI usually happens when there are no pings. Besides, people visiting us will soon enjoy the same same issues in full o/ 
---
Looking forward to that
---
Are they downvoting you because they think you are wrong or because of the butthurt about you being right? My ISK is on the second one.
---
Welcome to the Eve Online universe. 
---
As it turns out, not fitting resistances to your ship limits the ehp of your ship. Thanks for teaching me this lesson loo chondo!
---
Cool guys definitely fly ravens tho
---
yep, only 2 out of 4 accs. I'm not 100% sure about the fourth account but the third account was omega at march 20th 2018.
---
don't use rorqs. but well now i'm enjoying my carrier nerfs i guess. 
---
Scalie master race 
---
So I did get the SP, but i'm telling you, it's a dick move. Chat is broken since what ? One year now ? People that weren't subbed at that time got as much problems than others, and you are basically rubbing their face with your middle finger.
---
Oh no my safety
---
....nobody's falling for a shitpost because we expect you to act like a petty, shitty little cunt who's let power go to his head. Why are you suprised, after months of people calling you it, that you're getting downvoted for "pretending" (we all know you're not) to be it. 
---
Not sure what you’re smoking but you won’t end up landing at 30 km of a boosh fleet more than 21 that wouldn’t accomplish much. Even if you warp your hictors into the ennemy hic bubble your extra range wouldn’t do shit because they would just boosh away before you exit warp. Not to say that hics shouldn’t get a small scram range buff (just to get the scram to have the same range as the bubble at least)
---
I had 4 Omegas at that time, 2 paid for and 2 in plex, only paid for got the SP.
---
Dude give them a break yeh? They only had a whole month to fix the SP handout after the DevBlog.
---
Gold base is there for all of the ships to which this SKIN can be applied. You can see this on the wing of the Kikimora in the imgur shot that Choridon provided. The color of the light and the angle of reflection and type of material are pretty consequential here.  
---
The 3D Preview scene presents a dark nebula with an (average) blue-grey hue and neutral light color. When the light interacts with the gold, but not from a direct reflection angle to the camera, it results in a dark combination of the two. When the light reflects directly into the camera, you see something more akin to the brightly lit Hangar scene. It won't be identical, because every hangar type (there are 6 in game at present) has a custom lighting rig that illuminates from multiple angles in colors related to the empire origin of the station.  
---
That said, the 3D Preview does have two light sources, so you can rotate the camera to have the light bounce directly off the hull. The sources are placed directly beneath and directly over the center of the ship.  
---
Ways to access the preview before purchasing the SKIN:   
---
1. In the New Eden Store, click on the SKIN (or the bundle containing the SKIN).  
---
2. In the Show Info screen for the ship, select a SKIN in the left hand panel.
---
I have no idea what my accounts where omega on march 20. But i guess 3-4 maybe more. 
---
2 of my characters were subbed at the time 100% sure yet did not get it. Oh well
---
ITT: Some angry k-spacers take bait harder then the guy in the mackinaw I had jump into my C5 to “Haul my ore.”
---
I'm sure someone could waifu weebify the MMD.
---
Same, none of my accounts got it despite me being 95% sure two of them were subbed since before mar 20 and 100% sure 1 of them was.
---
30km range let you land on the edge of defensive bubble and scram stuff sitting inside of it.      
---
Indeed it is 
---
People will move to Sebo fits.   
---
Some mad good shit here, well done.
---
Wow. That was not clear at all. 
---
Subbed since 2016 (with money, no plexing) and no SP here, like most people I know. Guess you have another thing to fix now guys.
---
Huh are you really not getting that by the time you land the fleet has already booshed away. If you could just warp into it and fast lock dessies you would just do it with dps and alpha the booshers. I have the feeling that you have no idea of what you’re talking about which is fair on a subreddit I guess
---
There are subcapital counters to boosh fleets that don't require booshing. They require keeping constant pressure applied or using nullified ships, and they do require some setup time.  Boosh fleets could use a nerf but it's not as uncounterable as you're saying. 
---
Somewhere way way above us there is a dark circle with a small hole in it, motes of dust drifting in the light leaking through the hole.
---
That, is the bottom of the barrel.
---
Drugs (cheap ones) or cycle on and off each spawn also good engineering skills, you can mix those for expected result. 
---
Its still annoying having a cloaky camper in System you cant to anything against. You never know when the trap spings. I dont know if you had that but sometimes they wait days 
---
Must be fun being a bitter ex to an MMO
---
I can see from this thread that there's a few people claiming they didn't recieve SP on accounts that were Omega on March 20th 2018.
---
If your account was Omega Status on March 20th 2018 and you did not recieve 500,000 unallocated skillpoints on the highest skillpoint character on the account, then please file a support ticket.
---
The GM Team will double check to see if you were omega during the correct time frame and will issue skillpoints as required.
---
The nerds are angry Falcon
---
TIL :)
---
"ironically" ... lol
---
Literally said exact same thing as you about a different group of people 
---
Must be fun having 0 self awareness 
---
True ! "The land of gods" as Vikings calld it.
---
You should probably take another look at that. I have 4 Omega accounts that I haven't let lapse in the last two years. Only one got the SP.
---
The gesture is appreciated though.
---
You stow that shit Hudson!
---
This is fake news. Chat system is only breaks for those who subbed before 20th March 2018. It's totally fine for everyone else.
---
It's more like a shared google sheet, where you try and edit cells faster than everyone else
---
Yeah im hyped for the end of the NIP aswell :)
---
See ya on grid o7
---
Was it in 2013? That was my first PLEX that I purchased by exploring in null on a trial account (no cloak)
---
boosh fleets are stupid, they're not a fighting comp at all.
---
Gonna try some fits, but since this still doesn't do anything with Abaddon's atrocious capacitor instability, I'm not keeping my hopes high.
---
a ~~thousand~~ few 'GM Team' voices cried out in terror reading falcon reddit post
---
at least CCP_falcon showed up
---
i wish to be you right now
---
Indeed.
---
It's borderline abusive. Small glimmer if hope to keep you going, years of bullshit in between. It's the random reward conditioning. The cynic would say they keep things like this waiting in the wings for when the salt hits critical mass. The realist would say they are still as incompetent as ever.
---
Seems like you did not take gifted subs into account from what I can tell from my purchase history.
---
lol. CCP broke something? What's new sir.
---
Preeeeetty sure that will be more than "a few people". 
---
o7 friend, its not about ppl were subbed at the 20th maech 18 and didnt get anything.. Its about ppl subbed in the worst case at the 21th, had aswell almost a year a broken chat system but left without a compensation :( (no im not one of them)
---
A better solution would have been.. 
---
20th march subbed=500k sp
---
20th may subbed=400k sp
---
20th july subbed=300k sp
---
Or something like that..
---
Anyway thanks for my SP x) o7
---
Can't tell if troll or not.
---
2/3.14?
---
Again, this compensation is related to the extended unscheduled downtime and unscheduled server restarts on March 20th, the date of the deployment of the XMPP chat system.
---
1 out of 4 for me!
---
Really like the graph with all hits in grey and types colour coded and plotted as a line, great for at-a-glance seeing how much hit quality impacts damage. Would be nice to see this kind of graph with x axis plotted as rated dps for damage ramp up on various targets.
---
Sounds good! 
---
I unsubbed when they introduced instances.
---
Oh no rorqs are not super hard to kill mineral printing machine anymore :(
---
hol up
---
I've always flown it as a plex bullying rocket boat, or like a really big rocket kestrel. Theres ways to play it, but I do agree its speed hurts when comparing it to other destroyers. Still though, its a step forward. 
---
Sidenote: safety asset is amazing, I'd say just crank up the cost a bit
---
Yeah please send 500kSP to all my alpha alts, thanks.
---
That's basically how sov and umbrellas work now, cram yourself into a small space. What's been missing is resource shortage to act as a counter force.
---
First complaints are going to be "How are we supposed to keep all our systems at ADM 5 and keep our super umbrella effective if we have to spread out so much?". Yeah, that's exactly the point. Sov forces you to bunch up, resources force you to spread out, somewhere in between is an acceptable compromise between safety and efficiency.
---
yeah fuck me for subbing to the game right?
---
Nope
---
IMO it's not the corax that is slow, it's that everything else TOO DAMN FAST
---
Was looking for this comment ;) 
---
I think 'the patriot' with Mel Gibson displays this style of warfare rather nicely
---
So we're getting 500k sp for each day the chat wasn't working? Or is it for the whole year? 
---
Or just once per account like with the last event no ? idk, wtb brain ? 
---
his complain is about that specific date, as that is stupid as fuck. Whomever was subbed during that period till the announcement should receive SP as well.
---
But think about SP farms!         
---
Why you want to take isk from tens of thousands omega accounts owned by few people ?!        
---
This is free 500k sp to extract on each. 
---
I'm a little confused by your use of the word "solo". PvE has (with a few exceptions like SB-ratting, coop-abyssals) always been a solo activity and will continue to be. If even newbros manage to "solo-rat" in normal vexors I'm sure you'll still be fine in a vni after the nerf has hit.
---
There's also the ishtar, which is a very good ratting ship albeit much more expensive than the vni.
---
On the offchance you're not living in nullsec you can also try taking destroyers into lowsec to do beltratting which should be equivalent to vni ratting in null.
---
Most of the time the groups we dec are larger than us. You want to know what I thought of when I tried to find words for how we play? As a good American, I though of the movie, 'The Patriot'. The particular scenes that came to mind were when the rag-tag militia was intercepting the British caravans and transports on the roads... That's kinda what we do.
---
I don't care if you like my play style or not. There are many MANY other players in Eve Online that exhibit risk averse behavior that's even on par with mine. If you're so upset at us popping your corp and alliance mates 3:1, then maybe you ought to start coaching them on how to not be an idiot during war? Eh???
---
*CCPlease, when memes become reality*
---
Surely you understand that there has to be a cut-off point somewhere? Unsubbing because you didn't get a few days of training for free is a bit of a shame
---
That's still like free 250k SP for all of my alpha accounts. And I think I muse be cute with my 4 accounts compared to others.
---
Actually just for not using your brain fam. 
---
Here is a question. How would you catch the annoying pest doing this in a busy ns pipe
---
Until they maxkrab down the sansha loot prices.
---
They only nerfed the drone hp, it will still clear sites just as fast as before, and still have higher drone HP than a VNI.
---
https://imgur.com/dbaOanQ
---
I mean are they? They are a non-hostile exploration group. They leave cans with escape supplies in wormholes. 
---
I agree that it's neat and stuff, but hardly a benefit. I guess they do keep up with Thera connections and stuff, so yeah they are cool. What are you saying, they are a benefit while we arent? I don't mind being the Devil here, but we do provide services that many players enjoy taking advantage of. 
---
I'm not trying to "count points" against Signal Cartel though. I have no qualms with them, and there's really no point in comparing what we do.
---
wish in one hand and shit in the other, see which fills up first :)
---
I mean the kinda sad thing is that Abyssal is probably then the best isk/hr, which provides far less potential for PVPers to actually shoot stuff or get content. Forcing a spread out of rorqs and limiting resources would be a better way to deal with it. 
---
Mods are just a bunch of hackers and bullies. Good luck ranting. Nobody cares. 
---
Sexy !

&gt; March 20th
---
Fucking disgrace! We had no local in Jita for weeks between  November - January while CCP was on winter vacation and ppl like me that used to live in Jita during that time got nothing. Also my main that was paid with a meteor pack on march 20 as it appears on transaction log got nothing.
---
I want to share you my little story of the week :
---
Last weekend, we sacrificed some battleships in our wormhole system. It was a planned fight with respectable ennemies. I was aware, and as expected, i lost my Nightamre.
---
This Nightmare was my first one, it just had 3 years old, 9 killmarks, i did TVP incursion with it, fitted mutiple billions modules in it, then i made some fitting adjustment to make it a powerfull defense ship for our wormhole. Good times....
---
When i lost it, i was sad...but i knew this lost was not for nothing... this Nightmare has to die....
---
Everything you give to Bob, Bob will give it back to you.
---
2 days after, this tuesday, during a quiet morning, i was doing my scannning duty in a Shattered wolfrayet system .... and a wild Nightmare showed up ! I quickly took a garmur, came back into the wolfrayet sytem, tackled the nightmare, killed it solo.
---
That's it. I truely believe in Bob.
---
At least it's not as bad as the big dick discord. 
---
I think a wardec is already an act of aggression and you can consider yourselves fired upon already. That said I used to get semi tegular hellos in autz from signal cartel back in my Marmite days around hek/rens. They would turn up on station/gate/poco bash/whatever and launch fireworks at me. After the first time signal cartel members weren't harmed by me except during busy times when I didn't have time to check targets first
---
Im afraid of everyone who have wormhole aura.
---
I think the relic respawn rate is dynamic, i.e. not really maxkrabbable.
---
why was this arbitrary date chosen when the problem persisted for 10 months after this date consistently, and still infrequently occurs?
---
You can totally do it with a destroyer, it's not easy though.
---
The "think of the children" argument can effectively stop now since we have a mechanic that allows players to be in a player corp and retain their identity and friendships all while being immune to wardecs. They can even take advantage of structures through ACL. 
---
I have no doubt that wars had an impact on retention, but I don't see how Nullsec groups gobbling up new players just so they can be apart of your "Fuck you fleet" in your meat grinder, and then letting them effectively fend for themselves when they come to Highsec for anything can be any better than us "griefing new players out of the game".
---
Amazing since the local chat is still fucked every few weeks (including yesterday) that only so many people get the bonus skill points. 
---
The correct answer, from a customer service perspective, is completely fix local chat, then compensate (does not have to be skill points), if you are going to compensate at all (probably not actually necessary), everyone who is omega on *the day of the compensation*. 
---
Do you always copypasta when you talk?

I can’t find it anywhere. Is it drop only from the Abyss, or not ingame yet ?

It’s gorgeous. I want it.

Locator agents tell you the location at the moment you *start* your search.

You can totally travel 8 jumps in 4 minutes (or do a clone jump)

500k to every omega subscribed since February 20th
---
100k to every alpha that was active any time since February 20th
---
that's how it should've been
---
Yeah then brisc rubal would know your location
---
As someone not entitled to the SP (joined after the March date), yes, not getting free stuff for an issue I encountered sucks, but I get the rationale:
---
Everyone that invested money in CCP after that date (including me) did so where the current state of the game was known. We were not given less than promised, we got what we paid for. This includes alphas at the time who gave since gone omega, or were omega previously when there was no issues.
---
Everyone that had a sub active at the time of implementation, on the other had, invested money under one set of expectations and received something lesser than. They were not intentionally misled in any way, but they received an inferior product to expectation at point of purchase, and deserve some discount or recompense in kind.
---
I can't think of any other MMO that rewards trial accounts in any way.
---
CCP set the rules for this apology gift. Feel lucky that they gave any players anything at all....
---
Don’t post on here much. 
---
Thats not what the blog said, perhaps you should review it. You already gave SP for that day last year dude.
---
Shield slaves would still be so damn OP for supers. A max max tanked komodo with heated modules is capable of achieving 250.000.000+ EHP which is a fucking lot. Ofcourse this isn't that realistic but with shield slaves this will become a viable option, and I can't even imagine how much EHP you can get with maximum tank + shield slaves..
---
'solo' titans were never designed to be a thing, so it's not exactly viewed as a problem by people who have watched what capital proliferation has done to the state of the meta when that isn't an option.
---
That's like saying 'solo aircraft carrier/battleship' in RL. They are never sent anywhere without a sizeable support fleet. 
---
Ditto ratting titans, they were never designed for, they were a function of titans being overpowerful and spilling outside their niche. Your expectations are completely out of whack because (I'd guess) you've come up in an EVE that is basically capitals online, fuck everything else. These changes act as partial restoration to a healthier game state.
---
boost fleet comes in a problem when its comes to defend ur citadel grid , specially keep star . as the keep star grid so massive . they can run around side to side and keep shooting . basically they can shoot  300k  from ur keepstar, but from u they will be like 600 k even though ur also 0 range from keepstar . and its practically imposible to chase boos ravens during heavy tidi....
---
I appreciated the reference.
---
Thanks for reaching out to the community!  
---
Sure, but the point was to compensate players for the problems caused by the chat system, which affected people up until earlier this year. A scaling compensation scheme (as mentioned above, and last month in the forums, which were obviously ignored) would work fine. If that's too complex, just give the SP to everyone who was subbed on the date when they made the DevBlog, and thus had been impacted by the issues.
---
Selectively compensating customers who all experienced the same problems is never going to be well received. Especially given the irony that people running 50+ char skillfarms and who basically don't log in will get SP, but a single player who subbed a week after the cutoff, and who was actually affected, wont.
---
That’s what the war eligibility change was for though, and it gives newbros more space to grow and cultivate corporations in Highsec. The upcoming changes are for established groups to try and shutdown wardeccers.
---
Pretty much, and that was part of my original argument. Now that we (all of the major null sec alliance players) have been living under a super umbrella, we have come to recognize the benefits of that, and I am not motivated at all to risk my blingiest ship outside of that umbrella. 
---
The 'rewards' for doing so come nowhere close to being worth the risk, at least for me, and probably more so for people whose income is primarily generated through super ratting. 
---
Then combine this with the upcoming fighter and carrier/super changes... ouch--especially for shield supers. 
---
All that being said, after a few days in Delve just sort of testing the waters, I can safely say that the respawn changes have had zero impact on krabbing here. 
---
nobody really should expect that long cripled chat system and so damn lack of ccp developer power to do something about it.
---
And as well, why should somebody hold their subscription for unknown amount of time till they fix it? People gave CCP money even with cripled local as they have been expecting some sort of fix asap. Why anyone should wait with skill queue or other aspects of the game just because this?
---
Does it mean all those subs for CCP means nothing to care about? Should they next time simply not sub at all ? wtf is that logic about?
---
Yeah, but getting screwed over for months because of a change you were thoroughly assured would be positive and getting nothing as compensation is mildly infuriating at best.
---
I know.
---
And i saw him in local for one hour after he warped off to a gate and in one time i suddenly discovered a 200 people in local where usually sitting around 50 in this time, so i went to locator and launched searsh for him. Result on screenshot.
---
I posted it on reddit with some delay cause i didnt found thread about it today, so i did it by myself
---
Make HICs dangerous again!
---
Yeah so far the angel rats are absolutely alien static with this screeching noise at times, and some chirping. Pretty neat
---
Can the same be said of supers? How about if the Rorqual changes drive the ore prices back up, and super hulls start costing 25 billion again? 
---
How did the chat system affect the game?
---
I still played... still enjoyed....
---
\-WH
---
I used to have a cold every Monday and Tuesday morning
---
there is a reason they were so common.  
---
  
---
get some snakes and fly a pulse zealot, omen navy with more tank. 
---
&gt;  The hull energizers for a super might become a thing now 
---
They are already a thing. They are pretty much mandatory along with 25000mm plates for chinese supers
---
Exactly how am i supposed to see which ones of my 13 accounts were subbed that time?
---
Yeah, and? It's still interesting to see what's going on in the community.
---
Yeah, my time in null was in a small alliance with only a couple of systems, and my ratting alt is currently in PH, so I know how damn annoying it can be.
---
But since there are active things you can do against it, I think it's pretty balanced with all the stuff you have in favour of extremely safe isk making in nullsec.
---
Whoever wins we have all lost
---
LOI-L1 http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Omist/LOI-L1
---
That's my point though, a split umbrella is a less effective umbrella. And, for example, in Delve the super umbrella pretty much means that, unless someone does a hugely isk negative dread bomb, properly tanked supers will not be killed unless the pilot is very stupid. 
---
If you split that umbrella in two, or three, or four this will not be the case any longer. 
---
Sergaljerk is retired and not in TEST anymore
---
You have a problem.
---
Every day we stray further from the light. 
---
lol \^
---
It's time for a crusade the moment that NIP ends.
---
Now they just need to change the time for the NSA to five minutes like Siege, and all would be fine, or reduce siege time I wouldn´t care too, just make them work the same when it comes to time
---
0 out of 2 here. Support tickets in!
---
It 8s still great for boosting a bunch of subs.
---
Now i cant login into the server to petition because all are trying to petion at the same time. Nice.
---
 BTW i want to say what ever slight you think i did please forgive me its the 18th 10/10 DED in a row that i only get the CAN. 
---
\*Sobs.
---
Go for a C4-C5/C3
---
A bit easier to managed as you won't have the C4 dual static to scan and money will be better.
---
Regarding C5 pvp, there is roughly the same amount of C4 and C5 pvp group (while C5 are a bit more ustz than C4's EU) 
---
You're most likely not being evict if no baddy shows up during the anchoring timer.
---
Got it on one of my three accounts, the other two were probably Omega few days before or after March 20th, but not on that day. Lame. You would please more people if you gave free SP to everyone who had accounts in Omega state in between that date and some date not too far after that (say, two weeks later) rather than having them to be in Omega state at only one specific moment.
---
43 accounts, only 8 got SP. Something is wrong with the way this was distributed.
---
What would constitute one?
---
[lol i think CCP has a better idea of how to run their game than you sweaty :)](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=eve%20online)
---
What ships are these?  Is this the BB doctrine?
---
Well, they need to reduce either raw hp or raw local rep power of a fax. I would say raw hp. Them being massive time sinks for a fleet to speed bump through is annoyingly painful. I get that they need to be useful. 100 %. But being able to tank 100 battleships is oof..
---
Application is to their missile strike, not main gun on fighters I think. As long as you are applying those to the battleships it shouldn't impact it much. Also, if it does- add a paint to the carrier and paint your own target to keep ratting up. (also, less tank now sacrificing a slot).
---
confirming we put more effort into wardec gank attempts than literally anything else in this shit game. 
---
What happened with freighter fittings
---
Down voted for telling someone they should report racist idiots in eve. I &lt;3 you r/eve! You give me much faith in my fellow human beings.

---
This is either a low key code post or a complaint about the SPs...  
---
Wow! Amazing updates! To say “this is good” is a understatement.
---
If you want a good cheap whiskey, Old Camp is surprisingly pretty good.
---
It's only 500k sp dude
---
That statement is just wrong!
---
CCP already compensated every fricking Char (read: not Account, but char) with 250k Skillpoints at an earlier date!
---
Yeah which kills it for doing sites when your drones get attacked (like in drone lands).
---
But... "mother of all balance"!!! The game is fine now!
---
I would agree. Use a Nyx. Half tank, half dps. Hyperspatial rig + 1 hyper spatial module. (no tank if derp) Mid will be 2 sebo, paint, 2 omni.
---
awww
---
That's a lot of words about PVP for a group that just camps the Jita undock and scatters at the first sign of any trouble whatsoever.
---
let me direct you to the init killboard where you can see brawl after brawl with boosh comps.
---
zkill stats less elite - Flair checks out.
---
Freighters had no high, med, or low slots.
---
When they gave freighters 3 low slots they had to nerf the cargo so you couldn't expand it to levels that would allow you to import packaged caps to high sec, and the tank so you couldn't bulkhead them to absurd ehp levels, etc.
---
So they got worse in every way, to prevent one area becoming exploited by fittings.
---
Aka, freighters just got worse.
---
The funny thing is I actually feel like 500k is extremely generous for what has been only an occasional annoyance that in fact has caused more amusement and excitement (in content) out in nullsec than otherwise.  
---
You, sir, have a keeper
---
Wife her again!
---
All I want is that cloaky camping becomes more active like with the cloaking Module running for a maximum of 30 minutes before it auto declaoks you and you have to cloak again. 
---
You want good rewards in a subscription game? Subscribe or go fuck yourself. 
---
Auðvitað er Íslenska túngumál :þ
---
if you only think of ravens when talking about booshers. init has multiple brawling boosh configs. init also looses a lot of them. 
---
Nah, fuck alphas.
---
You want the good stuff, subscribe.
---
Afaik it's based on region, like you clear a site and it respawns somewhere else in the same region. Not sure of timeframe though.
---
You want us to do boosh talos? That's brawl. Narrative poof.
---
Upvoted ;)
---
I corrected it, thx. English is not my first language &gt;_&lt;
---
Or use sebo turbo jew carrier for same effect and lower costs. 
---
I don't only think of ravens, but of anything that is bulky, snipy and can escape danger by being booshed.
---
Like Feroxes facing decloaking bomb bombers on them.
---
Don’t judge this mans taste.  
---
Yea, I can see NSA dying outside of pvp. Although, just having the module equipped is what gives the massive lock range, right?
---
lmao...did u read ur own link? scroll to the bottom - its the same date. March 20. My point stands.
---
&gt; A tank usually has a machine gun on the top, in addition to its main gun.  That way it doesn't have to try to use its main gun to try to shoot infantry.
---
&gt; Battleships have smaller batteries, in addition to the main batteries. That way it can put more firepower on weakly armored close ships, while still engaging other capitals.
---
&gt; Carries have point defense, in addition to its fighters...
---
&gt; but somehow, in space, in only eve online, how dare a ship have secondary armaments to take care of annoying little things.
---
You are comparing reality to game design - that makes no sense. Reality isn't very fun when it comes to war and conflict. Eve is designed to be fun (no, it really is!). 
---
In reality, when you die, you die, you don't respawn. In reality, there's no magical insurance that pay back money for ship losses. In reality, there is no 100% perfect reliable coordination between commanders of ship. In reality, there is no 100% reliable intel of the battlefield like the overview and local in Eve. All these things were changed to make it an enjoyable game.
---
The rock/paper/scissors aspect is part of that game design. You want a rock that wins against scissors AND paper, and that's just bad game design.
---
Also, was not trying to be a dick. Sorry if it seemed like it. Cheers.
---
hello 911?.........
---
&gt;20% Rorqual nerfs will do that
---
Where to apply ??
---
tl;dr  
---
I tried stukas and I failed. NERF NAO CCPLZ
---
:-D, right? I honestly don't care about the 500k SP, but if they are giving free shit out they should give it to everyone. 
---
Imagine if only the people that were subbed on June 21st 2007 got a Rorqual? There would be riots.
---
I thought it was constellation-based, like WH.  Unless they changed it.  Anyway, yes, if there's a chance of IAP and assuming they retain their price, nobody's going to get rich on farming them in Delve.
---
Exactly what was NOT pointed out, if you knew how to read.
---
You actually already got what you asked for. In August every Char who was active got 250k SP.
---
Read more about it [here](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pcs4x8/login-database-and-chat-problems-the-war-continues)! 
---
No worries, I see it as a way to improve myself.
---
Lies! Deception!
---
In foutain it s our renter. Yeah renter feed sometimes.
---
The imperium controls more than the CSM. :Staredog:
---
Keepstars are not designed to be killed by subcaps clearly. You need to look at all the keepstars that died to ravens. H-5 was anchoring which is a huge difference and the rage keepstars were not effectivly defended on the timers and we could have done it with any other shiptype tbh.
---
&gt;really neat niche gameplay. 
---
That only one guy was using it as his lifestyle in 1 specific area, but don't worry you can still bomb them but I guess *Olmeca* Avecfort you are the kind to bother about it right ?
---
Im impressed. Something of this scale normally takes atleast 6 dev blogs and 7 months work time.
---
Advocating for such a nerf of the cloaking device that would evidently fuck up everyone using it (but mainly wormholers) because you want safer ratting space is a really asshole move.
---
Thanks for the tip. I really just wanted a fight but I see now that there was a good chance I could not win this. 
---
Thanks this is exactly what I was hoping to get from this! 
---
"What difference does a boosh fleet make to a gentleman?"
---
"I suspect it'll make a great deal of difference to a great many gentlemen, sir."
---
Thanks for the tip think I will avoid worms for now. 
---
your isk/hr in a rorq will probably stay the same as nerfing rorqs is a shift in the supply curve of ore, vs the unchanging demand of ore, so each unit of ore sells for more
---
however the price of literally everything goes up so vov
---
Fucking every kspace citizen because you cant just use 5-10 stealthbombers to kill a capital too but look where we are
---
Exactly, the proper response is "what's local?" 
---
Yeah but they say nothing about jumping. instead of warp you will jump. 
---
Thanks for the advice 
---
So now you're also complaining about Bombers.
---
Do you just not like it when you have a big dick I Win ship? I guess the game was better when it was F1 Machariels online.
---
Get rid of boosting without promoting a varied meta with a bunch of additional changes and that is what we will be back to. Hell Machs are still so strong that they're still quite present even after nerfs and a new organic boosh meta
---
Yep the navy multi will be on the ship from now on thanks for the tip 
---
FYI every last Mel Gibson movie has been bashed for being painfully historically inaccurate, especially the Patriot.
---
The only ship I ever lost to your alliance was a phantasm a few months back, when I actually came with 4 kitchen sinks ships to screw around with you. Your guys decided that was too much risk and undocked 3 logi nestors with 2 t3 and some other crap I can't remember. Total 9 ships or so. We're not salty. We just know you aren't fighting for content. You're fighting for easy kills. So stop pretending.
---
I'm getting the middle finger this April for being a rorq pilot. Never mind that ship funded my PvP and my junior fc efforts. If I get the shaft, then I don't see any reason why you shouldn't. I hope CCP completely kills you guys off, good riddance.
---
Who said I was salty about having to leave? I became inactive, I was told I'd be welcome back anytime.
---
Also look how many videos you've produced since I left...👌
---
You could always lower your graphics settings.
---
Following the same fate as the game in its current form then. Lots of the game worthy playing and subscription generation has stalled due to RL and/or time and the realisation that other games are scratching that itch. 
---
Gah, why are you drinking that swill?
---
Nope. Not going to happen ;)
---
Get yourself a bottle of of Rogue Stouted Whiskey you won't regret it. 
---
I'm assuming you filed a support request. 
---
Because posting here is going to do \_zip\_.
---
Thanks gamer.
---
I hope they give you some free sp.
---
Oh, i don't qualify for this, but i demand something because i have a silly sense of entitlement.
---
Please send me a fireworker launcher or i riot!
---
Taking almost a year to reimburse a faulty launch is arguably even worse.
---
You're missing a cigar.  I recommend a Punch Rothschild Maduro to go with bourbon whiskey.
---
was hopeing for some kind of graphic ui fix to make it worth doing
---
Last time I was around (fall 2018), CCP talked about implementing some sort of small POS that players could build to get started instead of investing into big structures right from the start.
---
Have those small structures been released yet? If not, what's the ETA?
---
If this isn't a bait post I sincerely feel bad for you
---
about 3 months to late...
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **2nd Cakeday** Marc_anneto! ^(hug)
---
I see Liek DarZ is still a loyal agent of code in the 3 or somthing years since i last ran missions ins Osmon
---
They are not out yet, AFAIK it's next on their list for structures updates. My bet would be some kind of information this week end during Evesterdam and most likely a release for this year extension.
---
PUT UP A WALL!!
---
i got rid of my tough cold by spending three nights with my brother, doctor jameson. 
---
most of us imgur.com
---
Honestly no one fucking cares, past 12 it has been constant whining on every update made. 
---
They’re trying to get away from POSs iirc.  Basically the progression starts with mobile depots and jumps to an athanor.  
---
You’re probably right in that a “basic” structure type (small?)  that does nothing except allow docking, fitting but can’t be anchored within 10,000km of an anomaly spawn.  
---
The short answer is it's much easier to query the accounts omega on one day.
---
We are ~~Legion~~ dozens! 
---
gimme website with timer, else I no believe youuu
---
He said adaptive, not reactive.
---
I use a damage specific hardener and rigs to plug holes though. Probably depends on rat types.
---
Aww :(
---
Now buff projectile weapons and minmatar ships lol.
---
When can we expect SP for the news system being down.
---
Ikr I wanted all my vni bot alpha accounts to get free sp too
---
last fanfest they presented player fob concept . look it up

Or just don't drink cheap whiskey

9 pissing accounts - all subbed for past 14 years no breaks and no fooking skill points on any of my mains - 9 fooking patitions for ffsk ccp

Sorry for the late reply,

Much appreciated for the link ;-)

Can someone tell if there's a way of forcing a really high-resolution screenshot save?  
---
Nice one Derth
---
There are also damaviks in the video firing 3 lasers similtaneously, so an assault frigate is probably also on the way.
---
f2p players were adversely affected too
---
They get shit all the time when they fuck up, which is too often but justified imo.
---
But i don't see why you have to shit on then for doing good things. You will soon enough get a reason to complain. Or not, which would be even better, right?
---
On the other hand they can't fit all of their drones into their Wetu?

as a mod you shouldnt take a "public trust" and use it to fight your battles. You have to be big enough not to censor your critics.

Remove the offending mods and sticky a post for fresh talent to apply, problem solved

I didn't say they weren't. They put nothing in, so they get nothing out.
---
Like bricktop said: if I throw a dog a bone, I don't want to know if it tastes good or not.
---
Unfortunately some things can't be forgotten.
---
And yet again ladies and gentlemen we have another F1 monkey here.
---
I would like to make u aware sir that you can actually change your ship in space.
---
So please imagine, if you will, a group of people, let's call them goons, jumping 500 Titans into a dead system at approximately 150 - 250 AU from the sun in your home region about 5 mins before down time.  Let's say this same group, goons, then jettison one combat interceptor each from their Titans and boards these spacecraft before down time.  Now, if your group has perfect intel, then you might just be able to steal 500 Titans.  But if your group in fact does not have someone combat scanning 150 - 250 au from the sun in every system (which is likely the case), you now have 500 Titans seeded in your home region that could be logged in and be ready to jump without you even knowing.
---
In fact, more likely would be a group, let's call them goons, having 500 Titans 250 AU off of their own keepstar grid with characters in combat ceptors (as not to show up in local) waiting to take a large fight on an attacking force who believes they will be getting a decently fair fight.
---
wait so saying it as TAC is wrong? fuck 
---
lol.
---
Youre thinking too small.
---
*safespot deep into the back end of the system*
---
*camper is running out of fuel*
---
*camper lights covert cyno*
---
*blops and crane jump in, drop fuel and jump back out.*
---
OR
---
*&gt;Campers now use Cranes, fuelled for life, whilst still having a 3.5s align time.*
---
Maybe not, but exploration might become more popular and sites more contested.
---
at least it makes it trivial to find vaguely-humiliating images to spam in local at them
---
Maybe - PvE caps certainly look weaker given the possible changes Falcon listed. If krabby-cap pilots decide to abandon their rorqs and supers for less-blingy stuff, yeah, there's going to be fewer targets worth a big fleet of bombers.  
---
At the same time, those fewer that remain will be more killable. I'd reserve final judgement until all the changes shake-down through actual play.
---
I mean, you see the hypocrisy there, right?
---
This. So much this.
---
You'll wind up paying more in taxes exporting P0 than you'd lose in effeciancy refining to P1 on the extraction planet. Also bear in mind you're sacrificing a whole planet somewhere to P0-P1, so losing what could be extracted there.
---
Coupled with the bulk meaning multiple trips, and it is simply not worth it unless you explicitly need the raw materials for something.
---
That's just horseshit.
---
But alongside this devblog CCP heavily nerfed anomalies. I don't think mining sites were part of it this time around, but CCP already stated they weren't finished.
---
&gt;They put nothing in
---
they put time in
---
Rum is more tasty plus u feel like a Pirate when drinking... It sets the mode for EvE 
---
This isn't communism retard
---
Yeah this right here is casus belli for test to just straight up cancel the nip early and go invade. No quarter given. 
---
Do you have any idea what time it is right now in Europe? Or Asia? That's a well deserved glass after a hard days work in other parts of the world!
---
Of the space I inhabit, both friendly and hostile areas, I would say 6/10 are VNI's, 3/10 are carriers and 1/10 are supers.
---
Could be that I live in china town and VNI's are just fucking everywhere.
---
I don't get this. "I'm not going to do the thing that makes a ton of isk because it will make slightly less isk!" Is there another crazy easy to make isk we all somehow missed that everyone will shift to after this nerf? Or is this just out of spite? 
---
Eeh... No. Learn to fucking read.  
---
"Pilots will find that every character on accounts that were considered active on March 20th, 2018 (the date of the March release and the subsequent extended downtime), have been issued with a gift of 250,000 skillpoints."

I’m doing that right now but I’m at work, and not playing eve :(
---
that gate looks very much like a fleet pvp/raid. that would be freaking awesome
---
with AMD drivers it's  called Virtual Super Resolution [https://community.amd.com/docs/DOC-1301](https://community.amd.com/docs/DOC-1301) where you can set your graphics processor output to a higher resolution than what your monitor offers as a native maxium.

Woah... this makes me realize I haven't logged into EvE in like years... when the fuck did it get this good looking
---
Taken from the Eve forums:
---
"Is this a joke? So you’re saying that you could potentially have gone through ALL of the shitstorm that has been the chat system over the past 10 months, without getting any form of compensation?
---
That seems to be the case for me.
---
These are my accounts, which were all activated with Omega after the 20th of March 2018:
---
Account 1 - Omega since 2018/03/31
---
Account 2 - Omega since 2018/04/01
---
Account 3 - Omega since 2018/04/02
---
Account 4 - Omega since 2018/05/26
---
Account 5 - Omega since 2018/09/03
---
Account 6 - Omega since 2018/09/04
---
Account 7 - Omega since 2018/09/16
---
Account 8 - Omega since 2018/09/30
---
Account 9 - Omega since 2018/10/31
---
Account 10 - Omega since 2018/12/10
---
According to your article, I won’t receive the skillpoints on ANY of those accounts, even though the majority of them have been Omega throughout the several weeks/months of the in game chat being completely bonkers.
---
Wth were you thinking when you made the decision on that date for the compensation?"
---
Sorry i missunterstood you then. I thought your problem was with being Omega at that point in time.
---
Perhaps the new remote rep system enables CCP to tie fax reps to signature size. 
---
A BS would get more reps then a Cruiser from FAX, but only repairing other capitals they'd live up to their full potential.
---
They are free to walk away with 0 loss if they don't like it. That's not so if you have an active sub running.
---
There's nothing to compensate them for.
---
&gt;Aka, freighters just got worse.
---
they got worse in 'general' but got much better in specialization, which is a buff.
---
If there is no threat of gank, you can haul double of what you normally could.
---
If there was a threat of gank, you can have over double the EHP.
---
If you have a brain, the freighter buffs were a massive buff.
---
&gt;Wormholes are static, so they’re always in the same normal space system, and lead to the same J space system
---
No
---
Wormholes have a static. That static leads to a class (c1 -&gt; c6, ls, hs, ns, etc). When that connection dies, it creates a new wormhole going to the same class, but (statistically) a different system. 
---
&gt;Unstable wormholes are random, appear and last for a few days, and lead to a random point in J space. So it connects to somewhere which may have previously had no direct connection to normal space.
---
All wormholes are unstable. Usually they last for 16 hours, some 24, some 48, and maybe longer idk I don't see longer but ccp is weird. Fun fact; there's c4 hole with a large enough jump mass to fit a super, except it doesn't spawn. Very sad. 
---
&gt;If I want to sneak into J space and go do a green combat site, I’m fairly unlikely to run into a bubble on the far side of a wormhole, and less likely through an unstable wormhole
---
People don't (usually) bubble wormholes. They might with a cloaked sabre, but not an anchored bubble. Again, all wormholes are unstable; no wormhole lives forever, or will consistently go from system A to system B. Just system A to class B. 
---
Also, bubbles will come to you in the form of sabres. Dscan often.
---
&gt;Assuming I don’t get got on the other side of either type, I warp to a random celestial body, then to another out at 100km, and I’m probably lost and hard to find.

People can d-scan your location. Most wh scanners will have combat probes to scan your location directly and warp to you, and many have virtues to scan you in one scan cycle. 
---
&gt;Then I can pick a green combat site and go do it, with little chance of being spotted.
---
Depends on your timezone and other locations. Some wh systems will be active, others dead. But yeah, more or less. Just dscan a lot. 
---
And assuming your entrance is there (didn't get rolled or expire) you leave the same way, yes. 
---
Wpsace isn't super active. You're fairly safe, but that seriously depends on what other wormholes are nearby. If you're one jump downchain from someones home, you're probably going to die. If you're in a dead-end system (no other wormholes) you're fairly safe, but no guarantees; someone can have their wormhole connect to yours by luck. 
---
Anime was a mistake.
---
I'd have every ship in the game maxed out if it was the former.
---
Was there a question in there?
---
remember there is a new ship coming out so maybe save the sp for that one, ofc if its the triv cap we think is coming then maybe not if you never fly caps
---
Well do you really need the Blood Raider security agents if you have Goons in Delve... ? :))))
---
Definitely not what the post said.
---
Abyss sites have some amazing visuals and effects. The lower difficulty ones can be comfortably be done by T1 cruisers, so you can do them as non subscribed Alpha Account.
---
Providing valuable learning platforms and attainable income sources.
---
Yea 32% is crazy high. Good on them.
---
Let's talk again when the chat craps out and suddenly you start seeing people in local in wormholes.
---
There you have it: perfect casus belli for TAPI.
---
&gt; I'm sure someone could waifu weebify the MMD.
---
Please don't give people ideas, Vily will have a stroke.
---
No you couldn't haul double, they nerfed the base cargo so an expanded freighter is barely bigger than it was originally, and you eat a hefty ehp nerf to get near or above the old capacity. 
---
WH are not static.
---
Each WH system has what we call a static WH, which means that for all time there is going to be a WH leading to one (for C1/C3/C5/C6 WH) or 2 (for C2 and C4 WH) specific type of space. For example I live in a C2 WH, with a NS/C5 static, meaning at all time there is going to be a WH leading to an NS sytem and one leading to a C5 system. If you close or the WH expire, another one in system will appears leading to another system (could be the same tho).
---
Unstable WH are just random WH that could lead anywhere. If they close, nothing particular will happen. You can find one leading from k-space to k-space.
---
&gt; If I want to sneak into J space and go do a green combat site, I’m fairly unlikely to run into a bubble on the far side of a wormhole, and less likely through an unstable wormhole.
---
Talking about every WH, you rarely have buble on WH, but it doesn't mean it's never camped. Especially high activity HS system WH have a good chance of being camped.
---
&gt; Assuming I don’t get got on the other side of either type, I warp to a random celestial body, then to another out at 100km, and I’m probably lost and hard to find.
---
Unless you're cloaked, you can always get combat probed. If you have a slow align time and slow warp time, warping to celestial body isn't super safe since you can get dscaned and chased down. 
---
&gt; Then I can pick a green combat site and go do it, with little chance of being spotted.
---
You can easily bet dscanned down and warped too.
---
&gt; And then get out the way I came, having bookmarked the wormhole.
---
Yup, always bookmark.
---
&gt; I reckon WH are in a way safer than Nullsec and lowsec. Entrances to Nullsec are guarded, and more chance of people patrolling lowsec looking for easy kills.
---
Not all NS entrance are camped but they indeed often are. WH are a lot less safer than NS because you cannot know who's inside since the local chat system doesn't list people in system unless they send messages. If you own the space you live in NS, you can easily see enemies and get to safety). In WH space, someone might be cloaked up hunting you and you cannot have a single idea.
---
&gt; Less chance of anyone looking for you in J space, and you’re harder to find.
---
Somewhat true because a lot less people live in WH, but you can still get caught.
---
&gt; I'm still to green to have the skills to be able to fight anyone off, so sneaking is my plan for a bit.
---
Use exploration frigates to run exploration sites inside them (the pirate ones, without rats) to get use to it I would say.
---
I'm gonna commission it then. :pog:
---
Who created this and do they take comissions?
---
How do you know that most of the implants come from agents and not from loot?
---
It doesnt matter what my opinion is, I'm not FCing a fleet.
---
Yes, the covi can outrun the jetcan timer.  Just keep that can open and keep dumping into that till it's full.
---
Of course they do. Because no company ever has made miscalculations when it comes to public relations and interaction with customers, or in the case of video games, community. 
---
Right, 'honey'?

I don't think a 100% facepalm success rate for hunters is what COX is aiming for.
---
But they can watch things and tweak how they see fit.
---
you went from like 800k to 1.1m with triple expander, it's pretty significant
---
Community? Ability to MAKE supers.
---
Fun Fact, supers were being made before rorquals could mine, a lot of people forget that.
---
There's a distinct lack of explosions in this screenshot.
---
Downvoted just because you made me read it three times to figure out wtf you're on about. Would help a lot if you used a spellchecker.
---
yeah i was memeing with this post. People took it way  more serious. I need a flair that says "Shitposter" or something, people always miss it
---
In other words, roughly one third of the player-base will be leaving their basements and attending an event in person. 
---
I don't have the data to support this claim, but I think that's a better percentage than most major sports. 
---
You obviously didn't read the local tank being halved, panic timer reduced or unable to stow all exavs with the reduced mining yield. 
---
It's almost like the majority of players don't live in the 8 places they're visiting.
---
The closest event for me would be over 1000 miles away.
---
I'd actually say that's pretty high no? Can imagine it would be lower for a lot of other games 
---
I thought it was 900 to 1.2. Semantics.
---
On a base that high, the extra isn't that much. Considering how much you sacrifice for it.
---
that was so weird
---

&gt;Wormholes are static, so they’re always in the same normal space system, and lead to the same J space system. You have to re find them in system each time but they’re always there.  
---
No, all wormholes are random. Some holes only last for 16 hours, others for 24 and there's the odd one that is 48 hours or so.
---
A wormhole will always have a "Static", this means that that system will always have the same type of hole in it, for example a C2 with a C4 (a Y683) will always have that Y683 hole and it will always lead to a C4. Each time the hole "rolls" or collapses either due to time (16 hours) or due to mass being put on it by ships, it will lead to a new C4 hole.
---
This means that holes are always changing, you end up with a new system ever day or so (or every time you roll the hole). 
---
Some people rage roll their static connection for content. Meaning they constantly put enough mass on the hole to purposefully collapse it to get a new one. This is a good way to find PvP or to find a specific hole.
---
You also get wandering holes, which lead to a random hole somewhere, either K-Space (Hisec, Lowsec or Null) or J-Space.
---
&gt; If I want to sneak into J space and go do a green combat site, I’m fairly unlikely to run into a bubble on the far side of a wormhole, and less likely through an unstable wormhole. 
---
Depends if someone lives there or if someone has seen you because you're in their chain (a chain being a string of holes all connected through either statics or wandering holes.
---
&gt;Then I can pick a green combat site and go do it, with little chance of being spotted.  
---
&gt;And then get out the way I came, having bookmarked the wormhole.
---
Always assume there is someone cloaked watching you. You are visible on dscan and hunters will look for wrecks on scan in wormhole. But yes, people can and do run sites via day tripping into wormhole. Sometimes you die, sometimes you don't. Always look out for combat probes and ships appearing on dscan.
---
As for getting out the way you came. Not always possible either due to it timing out or being rolled by someone. But 90% of the time if you're not jumping End of Life holes, you should be okay.
---
&gt; Less chance of anyone looking for you in J space, and you’re harder to find. 
---
People live in holes... They're always hungry to kill a random day tripper and they will often do so effectively. Just learn from losses when you eventually die, convo the pilot that killed you. Ask how he found you, what you can do to minimise the losses or learn how he killed you so you can adjust your tactic next time. 
---
Alternatively join a wormhole corp that does this and learn from them.
---
Are you crazy 32% for IRL events is huge.
---
It's really easy to stand on a soapbox and claim someone in particular is responsible for the actions of hundreds of thousands - but I'll gladly queue you into reality since you clearly have no clue what you're talking about.
---
&gt; the moment you arbitrarily decided that you are allowed to arbitrarily designate what is or isnt "interesting"
---
At what point did I start removing what I personally found to be interesting?
---
&gt;  instead of leaving it to the users, who are supposed to do so, the sub went to shit.
---
Such as the mod strike? That went well.
---
&gt; This is 100% on you and nobody else.
---
I'm not even  the top moderator. There are *five* people above me on the list and 3 other full time mods 'below' me. It's 100% my fault though because *redditor for 4 months* says so.
---
&gt; Now, it's a shitfest circlejerk populated entirely by the kind of thing you and your shitheels find funny, and wonder why it's dying? Maybe it's because you dicks aren't the cultural arbiters you seem to have decided you get to be? Maybe if you look around and only ever encounter assholes, it's not everyone else that's the problem, it's you.
---
So you want us to remove more posts **but only the ones you agree with** while also not removing any posts - because the community has to decide. Right now the only posts are remove are blatantly racist or can be merged with the weekly no stupid questions thread. I mostly stick to very clear cut y/n threads and opt out of modding content. I've locked exactly *one* thread in exactly 7 years of modding reddit, for example. You knew that though, right? Seeing as you're the expert after all - so much so that you can declare that r/eve is shit and it's squarely on my shoulders.
---
&gt; Do it, you're deluded if you think we're going to miss you
---
Aw, I'm hurt!
---
&gt; The sheer hilarious idiocy of you typing this without realising you're "their guy" to about 65,000 players (Imperium Legacy).
---
 This is what I'm talking about. You do realize that I got modded because I mod other subs as well, yes? R/eve isn't even the biggest one. You also realize that when I got modded the response from goons was *deeply negative for over a year*. There's plenty of evidence of this but, after all, you know all that already.
---
&gt; pretty much spell out clearly that you think your opinion of what /r/eve should be is more important than the users, which betrays a fundamental lack of understanding of your fucking voluntary janitorial position you powermad shitheel.
---
Your entire argument is based around the premise that someone who is an unimportant post janitor while also being important enough to single handedly destroy r/eve oh and also they aren't allowed to have an opinion. It's cool though because you posted it with *maximum edge* so it must be right.
---
Go to your account page (surprise!!!) and look at your transaction history (surprise!!!!)

Now for the hard part.
---
Look to see if you had a subscription during March 20th 2018, heres the trick, if had a 1 month sub, and it was payed on or after February 20th BUT before March 20th, BOOM you got it.

If you had a 3 month sub, well now we gotta start pulling out our calendars and really getting Sherlock Holmes on this bitch.
---
LMAO
---
So it's been quite some time since I last played.
---
Exploration Data sites, I've scanned a few down in High sec, do they all use Ghost Site mechanics now (invisible timer to site wide explosion with BS NPC warp-ins, roughly enough time to do one can) or have I just been picking up leftovers?
---
Also did the explosion get nerfed? I survived in on a non-tanked T1 frigate.
---
I’m with you on this. 
---
Have you never heard of Slippery Petes?
---
A fleet of 20-30 will dumpster fuck booshers in a typical boosh fleet. Especially since now Petes can be cloaked. Warp to 100, load Iron, GG
---
Yeah they're fixing issues with Eve. Such as broken fighter application and ridiculous isk printing from supers and rorqs
---

I’m actually happy you dug for your own research rather than ask dumb questions on reddit that are easily accessible. *self-identifying

Why are you throwing your gms under the bus? Rerun your script jesus fuck.

Wow, declared 32% attendance is crazy. 
---
Sadly, the flight to any of those places alone would cost me much more than 1y subscription. :(

Where is this info and is there a timeline? Have a dread in a WH whose ROI may have just dropped off quite a bit.
---
You can remove what was API key before and what is now what ever authorization token is used on Eve Online website.
---
You may have enjoyed it, but rorquals are ruining the mineral economy. They can't not fix something because a few players are gonna get butthurt about 'muh rorquals' when it is detrimental to the health of the game. Rorqs still mine a fuck ton, calm down
---
https://community.eveonline.com/support/third-party-applications/
---
Why are only omega pilots getting sp when this was a global issue that effected everyone including alphas?
---
dreads shouldnt be affected. 
---
Thank you everyone for the info. I think i was WROng. I now know loads more. Thanks
---
I'd forgotten about D Scan. Probably shoudnt ever do that again.
---
Both main gun and missile share application stats. Carriers can't use TP if theres NSA active too so that's at least 2-4 slots wasted to keep lock time + application.
---
Right now I'm 50/50 on it. The metagaming applying to the subreddit is a somewhat new phenomenon and it's honestly just annoying. I prefer to be in the background just doing what I do. As of now though pay close attention to the age and post history of the accounts making accusations. Most of the time it's someone A: ban evading or B: from a specific group of people (aka alt account or OP's corpmate).
---
I'm not looking for any sympathy about money spent or anything. That was kind of a about-to-sleep rant because of the change in nature of the subreddit. I love r/eve - and back it up by the thousands of hours I've spent dealing with posting instead of actually playing the game - but god damn is she a finicky bitch sometimes.
---
Yea but I meant in the actual game, not driver supersample.  It would be a bit of work for the engine people I guess as you have to segment the projection into N x M renders and then do your post-processing on the CPU... but for a game that sells itself a lot through screenshots I'm surprised it hasn't been attempted yet.
---
It’s a series of (mis)understandings that another constructive reply helped with besides your snarky comment.  -1
---
Would be nice if you could center it on something other than the command center. None of my stuff is near the command center, I have to spin the planet around like ship spinning just looking for my extractors.....
---
A minute is too long?
---
♥ Asher
---
I had the exact same thoughts for the most part actually.
---
Minor things id like to add:
---
Haw changes: Similar like the interceptor patch i believe ccp just went half way with it. I wonder what would happen if they made HAW guns polarized on titans giving them 0 resists and maybe 50% resists on dreads. Yes i dont think haw titans should actually be a thing at all.
---
NSA changes: Also not going far enough. Carriers shouldnt be able to receive repps when nsa is active.
---
Rorq and yield changes: I love hunting rorquals but i think the changes went too far here. I would like to still see them in space but i fear a lot of rorqual toons will now be extracted, resulting in the loss of content. Time will tell.
---
Hypocritical as hell for test to persecute others for having furries while T-S-K is in the alliance.
---
If my experience with any war Dec Corp stands up the whole "kill more isk than you lose" would go as follows.
---
Newbro dies in itty 5 with his pvp ships. 750m. Form fleet to fight war Dec Corp. War Dec Corp docks or brings 10:1 logi. 
---
War Dec corps are an annoyance to vets who have the spare accounts or instas in every system they may be in and a serious problem for new players or very small corps. 
---
I'm excited to see war deccers lose for once. 
---
I'm not complaining about the changes. I'm am discussing why I think the structure based combat isn't going to achieve the goal that CCP desires for wars.
---
I don't think you elite Nullsec pvp'ers are going to consistently show up after 1 month... 2 months... 3 months? Sure it gives a visible objective for you to broadcast to your fleet for them to press F1 on, so I can see why the typical Nullsec hivemind would prefer this. It's easy.
---
Run omni x 2, paint, and 2 sebo in mid on a Thanny? Dps and hyperspatial and you keep your total whore fit. Seems like a tick reduction but doable?

Not sure how well this would work, but you could try reaching out to diplos of the groups that control whatever space your assets are tied up in and explain your story, and see if they'd help you get stuff moved.
---
I appreciate your reply. It's definitely a harsh place here for anyone that doesn't share opinions with this echo chamber. I'm not worried about my karma or anything so they can downvote all they want.
---
It really kinda reinforces my thoughts that these people blindly oppose anything regarding wardecs. People are so salty that they would rather have some witty one-liner about how I'm a retard instead of having productive conversation.
---
We can have a difference of opinion, and that's perfectly fine! I think that productive conversation around this should take place and if you want to post how you feel about it all, I'll definitely take the time to consider it and converse with you.
---
Rating carriers and rorqs are being nerfed so risk vs reward might lead to fewer people flying them.
---
No he regularly drops on freighters which do die. And they feed live intel on our fleet position and movement to our enemies. Even if we switch to secure comms as soon as we undock they know what out response to any other aggression in our space because of the cloaky eyes. As soon as they know that they can't curbstomp our response to their aggression they just go dock up.
---
I'm sorry, but what is lowsec? /s
---
"Lowsec pvp" is a joke too man, lets be sad together.
---
I'm sadly waaaaay too far away from any of those places, but as others habe pointed, that's an incredibly high percentage of the player base.

Would you mind linking me (or telling me where to search) the source? We've got dread pilots in this thread who seem to think they're affected.
---
The funny thing is... For bigger alliances with the carrier/super nerf - training more rorquals is still probably the best option for scaling up operations? Just need those few extra rorquals...
---
what part of my statemrnt implies we arent going to try and farm them?
---
I’ve been asking for them. For, you know, reasons...
---
In Highsec a lot of people are cherrypicking containers with a cargo scanner, because the overall amout of stuff in these sites is fairly limited. Seems to me that is whats happening on your exploration runs.
---
As far as i know all sites despawn with an animation that looks like an explosion but only the ghost side ones have a damage component to them. Regular Data and Relic sites also don't have NPCs.
---
&gt; I am former EVE University member and I know how you and other wardeccers operate. And although your believes about the community belief about wars I like wars in Hisec since they always give me nice opportunities to bait wardeccers and kill their shiny ships. That is the part where I enjoy a lot in New Eden.
---
I'm glad you like to try to bait and kill us. It can be rewarding if done properly.
---
&gt; I laughed the part you said "if you want to fight us, catch us". It is hard to catch while you are running away like there is no tomorrow (although we managed to do that a lot of times) :) Most of PIRAT and other wardeccers (there are always exceptions of course) excels in Trade Hub and Hub Gate camping and nothing else and they use at least 2-3 out of corp alts to ensure victory (scouts and ooc logi) against a industrial or a pve ship. But you run away with the any sign of capable pvp ship/fleet that may counter you or you simply dock and refuse to take the fight. So in other words your suggestion.
---
Understand that the network of scouts and intel we use to operate effectively is so that we can see what is coming. This means we can see if another Highsec merc group is trying to setup a trap for us just as well as the hauler casually coming to Jita. Losses happen and we accept that, because we're subjected to the chance of it happening anytime we think that the hauler we're killing is harmless.
---
Having lived in the midwest for years, I've just accepted the fact that I'll never have a local convention that isn't at least 200 miles away.

Here is some good info on wormhole : 
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes
---
We also advise you to use a mapper that keeps track of the system you've visited such as : https://www.pathfinder-w.space/
---
It will tell you what you're in and the statics of the said hole.
---
Also when you get in a system you can always check zkillboard (https://zkillboard.com/ )  to see if one specific corporation appears regularly in the hole you're in, if  yes move along :D 
---
tweak: teathering during armor reinforce transfers armor from the tethering ship to the structure. 
---
It’s cloaked ;)
---
I think that Nullsec wars extending into Highsec is something that should happen more. Sure do Highsec wars have that much bearing on how a war is played out in Nullsec? No, because most groups have their own logistics network where they don't rely on highsec.
---
The coolest example I can think of was during WWB where we were paid to dec everyone and slay their jump freighters. Did that effect the corps and alliances? Probably not. I can say that I imagine it did have some sort of effect on the pilot that is apart of that corp or alliance though, and that's good enough for us.
---
Wars extending into Highsec are also super useful for wormhole groups too with how hole control and seeding holes happens. You can always tell when something is happening if you watch Amarr because you'll see lots of shuffling around of supplies by wormhole groups.
---
Best fix for cloaky camping is to remove local.

God damn it. Spreadsheets in space wins. I'll have to keep a log of the J space. 
---
Thanks for the tips 
---
ill show you being an asshole
---
I wasn't aware that camping the Jita undock is all we do. Damn, it's almost as if you don't really know what you're talking about... weird!
---
You know that currently they drop in Sansha sov? Like whole Legacy area... full or ratters, and yet biggest supply is from LVL4 burner farmers. 
---
I play nearly every day :(
---
Thanks, I'm a recreational player and generally don't keep up on the latest updates.
---
Ah this point, the insurance was just a joke tbh...
---
Well, looking at the official forums, more people seem to be angry about the coming Rorqual and super changes
---
Run some missions in NPC null space and you will know why do i know this.         
---
Aka how often you get a "implant drop" after whole day of ratting.     
---
Whole day of mission running give you multiple implants.      
---
I checked my 20 accounts and I only got them on 5 ? 
---
Wtf ?
---
Thanks for the the info - can I ask a quick question on Cloaks? As you're living in WH, you always using a cloak or will know about them Im sure. 
---
I thought I read terrible downsides to having one equipped. Doesnt it annihilate your speed and lock on times? Wouldnt that make attacks damn hard? Suppose massive ship superiority would compensate, and low speed is hardly a killer if you decloak in range. Probably lock on even with the delay before the other dude reacts. 
---
&gt; FYI every last Mel Gibson movie has been bashed for being painfully historically inaccurate, especially the Patriot.
---
I don't care about the historical inaccuracies in the movie. My point was that it showed a small rag-tag group of people taking on an empire in the best way they could.
---
&gt; I'm getting the middle finger this April for being a rorq pilot. Never mind that ship funded my PvP and my junior fc efforts. If I get the shaft, then I don't see any reason why you shouldn't. I hope CCP completely kills you guys off, good riddance.

Yay, "if I'm getting nerfed I don't care if you're getting nerfed". That's a strange mindset to have though, because as far as I understand the changes don't prevent you from hopping in your Rorqual and mining so I don't see how you are so doom and gloom about it. I do tend to take people like you with a grain of salt though... any change that shifts how efficient or safe you are and yall tend to cry.
---
"THINK ABOUT THE MINERS!"
---
Cute!
---
I accept your sympathy.
---
Spoiler alert, it's not because you boosh good, it's because you post bad.
---
Trust me ... yes, well actually only if you want to have similar prices. If you don't care about 8-10b for a full set then no. 
---
NSA don't give you huge lock range (i think) carrier base lock is over 4000 km
---
i feel like they just declared a holy war on sergal jerk 
---
I'm sure you're so butt hurt purely over r/eve moderation and not outside factors that [have nothing to do with r/eve.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/362417190596771840/555757014861742105/unknown.png?width=540&amp;height=158).
---
You're not that subtle.
---
None of which actually reduces the amount of mining really. You might have to.... I dunno, pay attention and do something if you've been attacked. So you might lose some isk by pulling drones more often/getting safe if something comes by that can kill you before theta gets to you. 
---
Let the purgation begin. 
---
So why did you allocate 250k SP earlier for March 20th issues only to allocate another 500k today (750k sp total) for that specific day and ignore the interruptions for 10+ months that's still ongoing to this day?  I have never seen CCP give out that much SP for 1 days worth of interruptions.  Something isn't making sense here.
---
This looks more like a Stain Guy alt.
---
Yep. We are giving ideas to CCP_MonkeyPaw, the new dev.
---
Covryn Clade #1
---
I will admit, that my time in Karmafleet on an alt showed me the wealth of information that is on the Goonfleet forums. I understand that with the umbrella recruiting that the largest groups participate in, there's no realistic way to teach everyone everything that they need to know.
---
So I ask this... When a newer player that is apart of some large nullsec group dies in a way he didn't expect or doesn't like, whose fault is it? The person that killed him? CCP's? Maybe it is the group that he's apart of that should do more to better shield and educate their members.
---
Granted I can say that the Nullsec collective is doing well to shield their members by constantly pushing for things that promote safety, and you can see it in this thread.
---
\^ this. 
---
I know the concept is foreign to CCP, but you thoroughly test your fix and then the same day you have downtime for deploying it, you compensate everyone. And not just everyone who is Omega, anyone who was omega during the affected timeframe.
---
And if the first fix doesn't fully fix it? Repeat the cycle. Make your compensation less valuable.
---
Hmm, you may have a point. Come to think of it, slave sets have a got a fair bit cheaper since blazeswarm moved into stain. Still, guess we get to control the supply now, I should start grinding BR standings on all my toonies.
---
No need for NSA then outside of pvp then, unless you absolutely need dank ticks and then I bet people mess up and are locked out of warp after anomaly is clear.
---
Did you start playing 1 year ago? The rate of inflation just started to take off
---
This is 100% it. I manage my subs by gifting from my trade alt. Missed out on somewhere between 3-5. 
---
Not the only error though. Looks like galaxy pack subs may have missed out and I have at least 1 which used plex but it wasn't gifted. 
---
And the word 'request' isn't in there either. Is this a joke being played on me at my expense?
---
But would you rather play a month of eve or a new game?
---
&gt; If my experience with any war Dec Corp stands up the whole "kill more isk than you lose" would go as follows. Newbro dies in itty 5 with his pvp ships. 750m. Form fleet to fight war Dec Corp. War Dec Corp docks or brings 10:1 logi.
---
It's all in the approach though. Yeah if we kill your Itty 5 and you come strolling straight down the pipe with no effort at all going into being covert, then how can you expect us to not either blueball you or counter?
---
Casually forming some fleet and expecting us to line up colonial soldier style is not how you fight us.
---
Do you just sell the dip? 
---
I spend 55% of what I make on player services.
---
Regaining faith ... praise r/eve for reeeeeing long enough 
---
"Rorquals are extremely powerful mining foreman ships, and their combination of power, utility, and defense has been crowding out other mining ships and leading to an unsustainable amount of mineral supply for the EVE economy."
---
In fact 100% exactly what I was saying since the buff ... and all the Goon REEEES I collected with that .... priceless
---
go outside m8
---
There is basically 2 types of cloak, the ones that doesn't allow to warp and the one that does (when active, that is). They also nerf your out of warp speed, but it's basically negligible, since any enemy ship that see you cloaking up will go much faster than you and will try to decloak you. And if you cloak with a improved one, you're most likely going to warp super fast out. Also beware you cannot cloak if locked, so yeah you're won't cloak in combat anyway. Most ships have a timber before they can activate module (or lock ? unsure on this one), unless they have bonus for it.
---
EG, you're going to use a improved cloak with ships that can fit it so that you can hunt or move very safely (eg, bombers, T3C with covops module, BLOBS, etc).
---
you probably missed the post, so it's understandable you're not on the same page - it was written by some guy named CCP Falcon, and it said "We’d like to apologize again for the substantial disruption that the chat issues have caused over the course of 2018. We fully understand that the severity of issues with the system was not fully realized early enough. "

Plex is constantly increasing

---
Well your seiged for 5 minutes at a time a 5 man vedmak gang will cause your tank to fail, drone yield is straight up reduced, and you'll lose 2 excavs assuming you stashed the other 3. Being careful is something you'd do in a carrier / super, ass planted for 5 minutes with half a tank. Only if your in a major power block (read as imperium) can you pop a panic and cyno to get your ass saved. Smaller groups will eat it over and over. Mining yield is straight reduced. Dodging neuts on a 5 minute siege cycle isn't skill that's luck. 
---
Yeah my eve client doesn't look like this on my 4 year old work laptop

I just found it very confusing that is says questions and in 15 sentences he doesn't actually ask a question. He made a bunch of statements he felt were true and said correct me and people did. I guess my "help" was more with writing than Eve but still.

Whatever I post that you imagine is bad, is still a game issue.

You don't have to defend even the ugliest thing your buddies do. You don't have to treat your relationship to goons like a fucking cult all the time. JJust accept talking about someone's mental health just because you disagree on game stuff is bad, and learn to separate spaceships from irl.

---
reddit smoothbrains not geting the obvious sarcasm and/or clicking the link smh..
---
I assume you used Navy Vespas? Then don´t forget that with reduced max HP, the shield reg will also get reduced hard. This was the main reason why those drones were so powerful on the Gila, because of the HP increasing so highly, the shield reg became so high that they could passive tank most NPC groups. This won´t be possible now anymore. They still have more HP than other drones, but you will have to call them back much more, as they can´t tank the incoming damage anymore as easily
---
Actually the damage range for turrets is 50-150% from base damage. And withing each hit quality type, there's a 20% damage range.
---
I haven't lost anything but a bit of time trying to explain to someone to actually ask questions in a threads titled "Questions I can't find answers to" or put the word request if they're making a request and want to dictionary quote about it. It's ok though, it's not a huge waste of my time and I am more than happy to help.
---
Give it the old geddon bonuses and I'll be happy +1 mid and drop a turret like you said
---
Just another LSH dread feed, nothing to see here
---
i was agreeing with ur point, go look at my posts on this thread &gt;.&gt;
---
There are basically 2 types of cloak. Covert Ops cloak lets you warp cloaked and does not slow you down, but can only be fit to certain ships. The normal cloak has to be off for you to warp, it slows you down while cloaked, but can be fit to any ship.
---
All cloaks give you a senor recalibration delay, causing you to not be able to lock anything for at least 5s after decloaking. If you want to attack you have to find way around this (Bombers, BlackOps BS, Smartbombs), reduce it(Rigs) or simply wait.
---
I've a question for you. How can we check which of our accounts were Omega on that date? 
---
I (like many people) have multiple accounts. If I log into the account management page on my main the last transaction showing was in 2017 when I bought a MCT with plex. 
---
There is no record of the omega time I purchased in game with plex anywhere. 
---
This might be the reason why some people are getting compensation on some toons and not others? 
---
I took a break last year for a little while but I don't know if I was Omega on the 20th of March on any of my toons and I can't see a way for me to even check this.
---
I came here just to say Angel's Envy.
---
move. on.
---
for jfs it's a buff across the board, no exception
---
for freighters it's still a major buff
---
one of the freighters had 700k cargo so just simplified '70% increase' to double
---
So glad you can make it!
---
please also next time you reward sp to a single character of an account, make it a redeemable item so i can pick which alt to give it to?
---
You are correct, the drones do bring in slightly less. I apologize. I did miss that in the notes. 
---
But my point still stands, watch intel and have friends to help you.
---
1 account out of 4 that was active got it.....
---
Does it make up for the frontloaded advantage of shield tank or exceed it?
---
doesn't really look like "eating shit" to me tbqh
---
You know some people have 100+ alpha accounts right? 
---
This arbitrary date, which you have received a lot of backlash on, is completely forgetting those of us who have dealt with the chat issues for months simply because we weren't Omega at a specific time. Many people will have dealt with all the negatives for months upon months and are being completely overlooked by CCP here.
---
Phantasm is the best ship.
---
Literally unplayable!
---
Smart bombs after decloaking! The bastards. Haha so sneaky. 
---
thanks
---
Just explaining how it works for now, I don't have any strong opinion about those changes in either direction.
---
What you should be saying here is the average line member of an alliance with more than 5000 players is ratting in a super.  Most alliances in the game has average line members not ratting in a super.  They are using carriers.
---
&gt; one third of the ~~player-base~~
---
one third of the people following eve on IG who bother responding to story polls.. I would assume response rate is pretty low on those things. 
---
so for us rl poor suckers who have to pay with plex, we can only petition the gm's and add to their workload for all the accounts we suspect are eligible but didn't receive the sp? :P
---
Could be, I'm in lowsec and the only folks waving giant dicks^Wtitans around are Snuffed Out. Since they kill cruisers and frigs and fortizars with them equally, my view is biased I guess.
---
imagine if rather than sitting around waiting for a cyno from your invincible mining ship, alliances did things like have miners in dead-end systems, prepared PVPers/tackle to slow down hostiles, shared intel, and gave you time to unsiege?
---
it's almost like it'd require some strategy, and result in PVP rather than just AFK krabbing. 
---
wild right!
---
Doesn't shoot first dt tank super hard?
---
Why? This is important information people might need to know when crafting posts on reddit. Especially Eve, people are known for being very sassy and mean sometimes so it's best to be as helpful as possible to avoid further issues later on.
---
Funny, I never realized that and I jumped out a few times. Must have instinctively turned that thing off in time then. Didnt even think about it :D
---
All I'm trying to say is that this isn't *that* crazy. People will quickly adapt and those who don't are bad.
---
As everyone has said, they are not out yet. However, the current medium structures, which do require a corporation, are quite affordable for an individual, so that's neat!
---
The problem is that we can't counter it period. There is literally no counter play.
---
A prop mod? On an abaddon? Pahaha.
---
   
---
The cap is meh, granted, however in abby fleets i always just ditched the propmod and ran injector, battery and 2 tracking comps. Worked a charm and no cap issues.
---
There's big difference between "being able to haze tackle" on the level of ratting supercarrier ability to apply damage and bomb bubbles (which is dumb), and to "not get completely stopped by random single sabre/broadsword until he gets his friends to login and form up to kill it over next 30 minutes or so". I did fair bit of hunting travelling supercaps and - with how HAWs work now - it gives nice balance between being properly prepared to move (proper travelfit for space you're going through) and being properly prepared to catch the mark (having a way of tackling the target if they're prepared to deal with dics/hics/rorquals, there is no single fit able to handle all cases reasonably well). As much as I enjoy every single supercap being killed, I feel like the killmail should be reward for effort put into hunting it down, not just having that one ship capable of holding it tackled forever.
---
Are you still here!?
---
Only kidding. You are correct and always were correct. I am sorry.
---
Now off you go......
---
It would! 
---
It automatically turns off if you initiate warp, so if you did warp -&gt; jump, then it was off for sure.
---
Heyo, just a little tip here: There is a standard way to format ship fittings across all EVE communities. Both the game and PyFa (a 3rd party fitting simulator) will let you export a fit as a block of text, which other people can then easily import. You can then paste it into a reddit comment, select the whole block, and click on the button that makes it into a code block (alternatively, add 4 spaces in front of every line, or just write it as a quote).

My issue is that, as you pointed out, high sec war deccers are risk averse and so they will not fight if you bring a fleet, its not engaging or fun for me I've successfully killed war deccers but the time investment per kill is significantly more than almost any other content. I obviously want more content where I live rather than in high sec making me rather biased but all this achieves is a requirement for more alts and tedium.
---
If your account lapsed omega for a day do you not get any SP? I think that happened for me and now I didn't get any :(
---
1400mm artillery Abaddon doesn't care about cap :)
---
Think it depends on what youre up against. FW engagements/fleets i can see where no prop is fine. 
---
An MJD is still considered a prop mod. Useful for escaping or repositioning (or dunking on a ferox 100km away).
---
Id agree that the Abaddon is not going to chase anything down, but im sure itd be nice to burn through a bubble in nullsec at 800m/s, rather than 101m/s.
---
i fondly remember solo killing abaddons with all sorts of ships like rupture, hurricane, vexor, exequror ( no not the navy issue one) . It's such a bad ship with the absolutely atrocious tracking speed, cap hungry... it's a huge brick with lasers on it
---
Sad so I should forget about the dream of making a dread in side my WH? Since I'd need a fort or need to have it sitting in a bubble.. 
---
70% is closer to 50 than 100. You're talking serious liberties rounding that up.
---
Which was last used 3 or 4 years ago? Stop living in the past man! Embrace the Abaddon laser heritage.
---
Also, leaving 37.5% damage on the table for arty fit when you have the mach or fleet pest as an option is silly.
---
You seem to have forgotten that they wanted us to fit ***rigs*** first
---
These things tend to roll/take some time to get applied.  I'd give it a few hours.
---
Even against other battleships it kind of flounders because its so easy to neut out. Killed one not too long ago in my typhoon FI.
---
Thanks for all the great feedback guys! Have definitely given me alot to think about! 
---
Seriously, like all they talk about is EvE!

Not at all. Why would we set timers out of our prime?

Thanks for the very detailed response! Also is there any use in researching all the other systems in my home holes group.

Also thanks for the response! 
---
The Ferox got the nerf it needed but let’s be honest. It will still be the ship of choice for most large scale fleet engagement. 
---
It is something I guess. Cant really see anything happen with it tbh. The geddon is ok. The apoc is..well its there. This is just a brick. A brick with cap issues. 
---
CCP can snatch Victory through the jaws of defeat by just making it a feature. Highly mined/ratted systems will have local go boom randomly for an hour every few hours.
---
That'll show them filthy krabbers hiding under the umbrellas 
---
Um...no. titans shouldn't be able to hit anything smaller than a battleshio, and that poorly. If you want to kill an assault frig gang, bring a cruiser or destroyer gang. Titans should do basically nothing to subcaps.
---
Komodo is a titan and not a super.

If you decide to do FW I highly suggest reading up on the negatives. I did it for years and it was great fun. I highly suggest joining an FW corp fi you go that route. I know Villore Accords (alliance) still has quite the presence in GalMil
---
The trick is to not show your hand to us. We engage stuff all the time if we think it isn't going to result in a trap or our fiery death. Make us think that and you've won.
---
Yeah it's more effort, but it results in actual dynamic combat. I'll tell you what's going to happen with structures... If you bring a fleet we can't handle you'll just get a cheap structure kill. Yeah you'll turn off your war for 2 weeks, but there's plenty of fish in the sea.
---
I just have a hard time thinking that groups will show up every 2 weeks to timers that last over a week to take the structure down. When citadels first came out and Pandemic Horde came to Perimeter to claim their market hub they paid us to stop harassing their timers because they couldn't be bothered to form for them. It was an inconvenience even though it was a major investment and potential profit to be had.

I noticed this today. It doesn't whip all around and zoom in like it's a drunk sailor.

You can also hit up Zam Slam in game if you want someone to chat with! Spent years recruiting newbies for lowsec PvP, I've since moved on from that but I do know a few good places to check out depending on your interests!

Use your fav hac in abyss sites ( I used cerberus). Normal combat sites use a bs (raven, rattle, etc)
---
I agree that structure fights aren't fun but I get more fun content not bashing structures almost anywhere outside high sec, for me ganking all the time isn't fun even if there is elaborate bait, so I don't fight high sec pvp to be fun. I agree that this will be shit for you guys.

How do you get it ? From The Abyss ?

I can’t find it on the market anywhere. 
---
(My question got lost in last week’s thread just before it closed.)
---
TBH if they just sorted out its cap it would be on par with other T1 battleships - just increase its base regen by a small amount (or possibly the whole pool which will give you a little more resistance from neuts).
---
Host them on imgur.com (as hidden, they have a strange community that doesn't get that most other internet users are using the site just for hosting purpose), and paste the link here.

It's +10% damage, 1.375 / 1.25 = 1.1

same and i lost a lot of ships 
---
Armour 'slaves' will almost certainly go down in price thanks to Goon autism farming, so I wouldn't worry about that. It has little to do with how many agents there are available but more to do with how many people are running missions from the available agents - SOE agents in highsec are few in number but tons of people per agent are running their missions hence their SP store equipment is relatively inexpensive.  
---
Just look how cheap Bhaalgorns are nowadays compared to when before Goons moved south.
---
I fly non cap boosted battleships all the time. Buffer fitals still exist.
---
Regardless, Most other battleships have more than 4 mids, or tracking bonuses to compensate lack of mids (mega/apoc).
---
I don't agree with the reasoning but I do agree with the result, buff hic scram 2019
---
&gt; As soon as they know that they can't curbstomp our response to their aggression they just go dock up.
---
Looks like you countered it.
---
The abaddon is more of a fleet dps slugger than a small gang ship tbh. The geddon occupies the small scale niche already, and if you want a web/grappler brawler, other battleships come to mind from other races such as the hyperion.
---
We countered their fleet. We did not counter the cloaky eyes.
---
Looks like the cloaky eyes didn't help them not getting countered.
---
At this point you're just bitching that you're not 100% safe in your space. Welcome to EVE.
---
You're right it's not how to fight you. Because you don't fight ships with guns unless you out class or way out number them.
---
We trained new pilots they were never in anything intimidating. Maybe gangs of 10 to 15 frigs and destroyers vs a gate camp. It didn't matter any Spike to local with WTs and they ran with tails between their legs. 
---
You have a very romanticized idea of what you do. I'm not asking you to pay penance for killing a new bro by lining up your instalock brick tank vindis. I'm just happy someone can end a war now because war deccers have been abusing an ignored mechanic for a very long time. 
---
There's nothing more frustrating than hearing a new player lost their Plex bought stuff to an unavoidable, unendable, whack a mole scheme  at a trade hub. Yes they ignored a logistics service, yes they learned a lesson, and yes it's all legal in the game. But it doesn't make the game appealing to anyone except you.
---
I think deep down you can acknowledge your tactics of retreating as a war deccer are more along the lines of "guns on ship + didn't undock from jita = flee" than "we only take fair or unbalanced fights in our favor" 
---
months ago
---
The clades disagree on rogue drones that is why you both have suppressors and drones flying with the Trig
---
Been wondering the same for a while now 
---
It's a good question.
---
So you have ruled out the obvious answer of 'just focus on your static' which is good.
---
It could be argued that you could work out a WH regional map, then using various third party sources which holes are most active in what regions and then  make an assessment, but i feel like that is a lot of work and will limit you to then finding that 'one hole (which is feasible).
---
Personally if isk making is what you want from your hole (I get that from you wanna run sites) personally I would look at WH size (au), PI variety and grade and then system effect before I tried to work out the best hole in the best region.
---
So in short you could crunch the numbers, but the effort would be huge and place a lot of restrictions in finding the right hole.
---
o7 
---
Jesus fucking christ you are dense. My guess is that you abuse this mechanic a lot so you have a lot of investment in seeing it remain uncounterable and 100% safe.

Can you imagine StainGuy’s reaction when he’s having remodel work done on his house and he asks the contractor to put a door in a wall...
---
And the contractor says “ok” before StainGuy has a chance to start his 53 chart presentation on the importance of the door and why both rooms will benefit from the existence of the door.
---
I can’t decide if that would be relief, or if StainGuy would die a slow death inside because he isn’t able to expunge all the arguments for his request, there’s no audience and no need to explain his position.
---
This actually may be the reason CCP keeps saying “no”... they’re just looking out for his best interests.
---
I never suggested otherwise. But more damage isnt going to make it relevant to fleets if they go cap dry from one void bomb and cant recover.
---
Then having cap issues and 4 mids doesnt make it desirable for solo/small gang either.
---
Also, having one amarr laser battleship that can properly brawl and not be stuck in a 4mid configuration isnt asking for too much, is it?
---
I've said what I had to say, you're just wanting to be 100% safe at this point. This conversation is over.
---
FYI - my laptop would probably burn up if I left 5 accounts open overnight. I just safelog.

Can’t wait for my higher caliber 600m glass cannon
---
I might take that compromise if there is a local delay too so you can enter a system then turn on cloak without ever showing up.
---
It will probably make moons private property instead of free for all again. So basically renting.
---
I figure if we use it enough it becomes the new correct.
---
Faction warfare is the greatest starting point for a new player hands down.  Just gotta join an active corporation of pilots to fly with, and most will give out  cheap starter ships for new players. 
---
there are several hypotheses about WH anoms. the most common is : then an anom depop, it respawn in another WH in the same constelation (some says it's in the same region).
---
If youy have an alt in each system of your constelation/region, you can trigger every anoms (warp and cancel warp), they will depop 3 DT later. do it every 3 days and you will have lots of anoms in yours home.
---
all of this is theorical, I never could verified this myself.
---
Hmm. Yes those are definitely good arguments. This should definitely be one of the last things you're worrying about compared to PI etc.. Which BTW was ass in my last WH with only 2 planets...
---
So about size. I assume this is just so we have a nice tight wh that doesn't have ridiculous 200au(hyperbole?) jumps that will add up over time? 
---
While I don't really hate the guy, he is kind of insufferable. He has delusions of grandeur about his goongriefing and regularly accuses both the mods and users of this sub of goon bias extending into the conspiracy realm. 
---
I feel like laser ships shouldn't have to worry about running out of cap during normal operation. Its like why would they design a ship that cant run its weapon systems the whole time?
---
Makers Mark uber alles
---
That art style reminds me of Zone

For one more second at most, those just made you have to restage

They do not have resist bonuses though (which is one of the strongest bonuses in the game).

---
I'm really on a roll of getting shit wrong today huh.
---
&gt;There's nothing to compensate them for.
---
there literally is though, a major portion of the game being inconsistent for a year now
---
Easy Fix.....just like WHs have a mass limit, and booshers can only jump certain masses. Put a limit on the module... "Can only successfully boosh up to X amount of mass per cycle" that way it can only boosh lets say 1B mass instead of 150 battleships with ease by 1 little ass destroyer? still gives viablility to the tactic  but requires more booshers and a longer cooldown instead of them jsut jumping around every 6 seconds on a broken and in many cases unbeatable mechanic?
---
Kinda sounds like increased content from Rorq save fleets to me...
---
yeah but the big fleets will always be cycling a boosh, never sitting still for more than 10s. Not really enough time to warp a fleet there, decloak, lock and volley.
---
It happens. EVE mecahnics are weird
---
700k is close to 600k and freighters can haul almost 1.2m now
---
that was my headmath
---
It's not even about Pirat getting the attention of everyone and getting blobbed - I'm fine with that happening. The point I'm making is that even for other groups in Highsec that won't get the Null blob knocking, these mechanics suck.
---
Lets say you have a small Mom &amp; Pop group setup for content wars in a remote area in like Minmatar space. You anchor a Raitaru and do things such as clear out nearby structures and engage the locals. You get a wardec from Pirat and they bring their hammer down and snuff you out. 
---
There's just not a situation where Structures are beneficial to anyone other than larger groups. I just don't see it as something that is going to cause more ships to explode. Instead it'll just be structures going boom.
---
what in the actual fuck did I just read
---
Ccp falcon bsckpeddling to justify not giving sp to players who subbed after march 20, should have just given any account that has had omega status since march 20 the SP as a redeemable (we had them for Christmas did we not...) but no why do something logical 
---
How can I tell what class of wormhole I am in? Do I have to do an external lookup of the system with a third party tool or can it be done in-game?
---
Dunno, maybe you should go see a doctor if you are unsure about your ability to comprehend stuff.
---
Or take less(more?) of the drugs/alcohol/whatever ;)
---
Underrated comment. 
---
Local chat has been broken for a hand full of days, it's really not that big of a deal.
---
something tight so you dont have to warp 30 au to a fight location from your staging citadel which is being watched, giving the opponent ample time to do something about it, I would say. 
---
At least that s whats bothering me the most
---
This was an issue for a year and is still a problem, setting a date in march of last year hardly covers this at all, just give anyone omega for 2018 the SP and stop setting arbitrary dates. 
---
iirc hardknox verified that for everyone when they held all the nice c6s
---
&gt;Local chat has been broken for a hand full of days, it's really not that big of a deal.

To fix this please submit a support ticket at https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us .

If I had to guess, a premium SKIN would be one that has never dropped in-game, only available from the NES.

13 years of research and study prior to starting playing sounds a bit light tbh. You'll need to sacrifice your social life for the next few years to catch up :p

third party tool. use a mapper tool, which is how you should go about whs anyways.

I can afford to build them and pay for upkeep but I'm currently not playing on a regular basis, so I can't defend them properly.

AAR: Typical whaling fleet of a Tuesday evening a few weeks ago turns for the profitable when a scout finds a pod in a Benny Hill-esque chase after a Hel, it having bounced off something inside the POS. We quickly moved to secure the capital  (some pun intended) and attempted to ransom it back. Despite offering a very reasonable price, we were unable to secure trust for the exchange, so opted to safelog it and move to get it out at a later time.
---
Over the last two weeks, our pilot has been chased across EVE null and lowsec by skill urself HICs at every log-on, but finally managed to move the Hel where the buyer we had lined up requested.
---
Very much one of those chance epic moments EVE is so good at creating!
---
&gt;The t1 geddon is the only amarr battleship that doesnt need a cap booster
---
doesn't navy geddon have a cap use reduction? o.0 like to 50%?  does that help...or not enough?
---
I disagree that fighters will still be able to apply well to cruisers (we’ll HACs anyway).  My experience has been that carriers already struggle mightily to apply to a competent hac fleet at all.  With this change light fighters will pose little danger so long as dromis are killed.
---
I thought freighters originally had one low slot?
---
yea looks like a close but lost fight lol. 
---
Test bad goon gud
---
Pod making chase was fucking comical. 
---
&gt;you're using them to make claims that are basically false.
---
at the end of the day the lowslots were a significant buff to haulers, just ask any ganker that sees the 600k ehp freighters moving around instead of the forced 300k ones
---
Im so excited for more K space salt....this is priceless. You could prolly go inhabit a C2 or C3 and make more at a lower cost than risking a super....just saying, maybe its finally time to stop stroking off the blue donuts and make eve more fluid instead of stagnent again. 
---
Cool so since I subbed my alt on March 23rd and still had to deal with fucked up local all year up through today, no SP for them, ditto my younger Corp mates. I'm not usually one to complain about compensation but this was a half-assed way to try and make a major fuckup that had major game impacts. 
---
I have 40 chars and none of them got sp. I don't have time for 40 support tickets.
---
Won’t be used until cap issues are addressed.  Also bhaals are so cheap they make more sense in most situations if your going to fly lasers.
---

---
Not without a significant corporate backing. I know dozens of groups that would lunge at the opportunity to catch something like this. Think of it like this. When you only have a medium structure like an astra you have a defensive value of 1 and a target value of 1. When you anchor a new structure (especially a large one) that value spikes but defensive stays the same. Once it is anchored, you again have a good value/defense ratio. It's mainly about that period where your value outweighs your defensive capabilities.
---
Starve the flu and drown the cold. 
---
wat?
---
you know, the guys you are trying to deploy against, but had to set a 5b fine for ratting losses instead
---
2.5 min boosh fatigue after 7th chain boosh. That way you can only constant boosh every 20 seconds.
---
Please don't nerf excavator booshing more.
---
It’s less wrong and more that it’s uncommon. It comes from Navy flag signaling, where “tack” refers to the tackline and is notated as a hyphen. Then the term spilled over into *NIX, because command options/flags have a hyphen before them, which programmers would call tac/tack.
---
Ahh ok I knew it burned out didnt know it dosent effect other rorqs. Thats good. In theory tho you could have a few of them in each rorq and refit. Unless it gives weapons timer which I doubt.
---
The vni and gila will still see extensive ratting use after this dont kid yourself. The vni needs to be redesigned its soooo strong. At least drop a heavy ccp fuck how does it wield more than a BATTLECRUISER ..
---
The vni I could see go down a little as we move to gilas but its still the go to platform..till they bring its dps in line with real cruisers its going to be king.
---
It does, but its strangled by fitting and its cap still hurts with certain fits.. Though as it has a utility high, you can at least use a nos to supplement the booster, which helps.
---
So I thought, until I saw the Aeon Eros Blossom (or am I mistaken, and was it not lootable during the Guardian's Gala ?)
---
would a similar cap reduction bonus help abaddon?
---
Had a break from Oct17 to June 18, glad i was unaffected by the chat issues and have consequently not received reimbursement of any kind.                 
---
/Sm just in case it was not obvious
---
It comes from Navy flag signaling, where “tack” refers to the tackline and is notated as a hyphen. Then the term spilled over into \*NIX, because command options (*flags*) have a hyphen before them, which programmers would call tac/tack.
---
Have you seen the Cown vids - 800mm AC and a fat tank used to work on the Abaddon for solo.
---
Yes, but then youre either losing damage or tank, both of which would knock it out if its niche.
---
Adding cap regen or pool would help get the same effect. Alternatively dropping a gun+plus more regen would help as well.
---
This is so fucking true and every time I talk to someone new in Corp I just assume s/he is at least 25yo. 
---
Designed to be run in a fleet context - amarr logi have cap transfer bonuses for good reason :)
---
If you’re looking for a Corp, I hear Dreddit is recruiting. 
---
To add shield slaves, they wouldn't need to shuffle everything around, but they want to. They could easily just add the set as Guristas' or something.
---
Oh okay, that's neat. I only got my numbers from looking at the means of each set vs the means overall. Some of those data sets were pretty small so mine are probably off because of small sample size.
---
That's still a lot though, wow

[][][] #FORTNITE  Me and my son have always had an up and down relationship. I think this is due to us not really have much in common, its hard for us to bond. He is a huge fortnight fan, and his mother made him a John Wick costume for Halloween (His favorite skin). He was beyond happy. He really loves Fortnight. I took Halloween as an opportunity to bond with him more, so without him knowing I had his mother make me a fortnight costume to surprise him. I scrolled through google looking at different skins and eventually decided to go as what they call "Rust Lord". The outfit seemed easy to put together and it had a bad ass feel to it. I even researched some of the more popular dances (The Floss, Best Mates, and Orange Justice) I spent hours learning these 3 dances, I don't consider myself all that coordinated but after some time I felt I had them down perfectly. Halloween night came and my son went out trick or treating with his friends. As they were out I put on my costume before handing out candy to the kids. I was surprised with the amount of kids that recognized my costume, I was a hit. Until this group of kids, dressed up as skeletons, I guess they are called skull troopers nowadays? I dont know, looked like skeletons to me. Anyway, what seemed to be the leader of the group didn't seem impressed with my costume, he actually seemed bothered. In a demeaning tone before even getting any candy he asked if I could floss. That smirk on his face turned into full blown surprise as I dropped the bowl of candy, and put every bit of energy into the best floss I could muster up. I nailed it. Surprised but still unimpressed the leader said not bad, but lets see your orange justice. I don't know what came over me but I completely blanked, he caught me off guard despite my hours of preparation. I couldn't let this 10 year old alpha me so I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, and started flailing around like an inflatable tube man caught in a hurricane. I finished my dance, and silence followed for what seemed to be an eternity. Next thing I know it the group of skeletons erupted into laughter and started jumping left to right while holding their hand in an L shape formation. I was embarrassed, I slammed the door and I kid you not, thought about crying at that very moment. My man hood compromised by a group of young children, but that wasn't even the worst of it. 20 minutes later my doorbell rings, which is strange considering I turned off the porch lights after that embarrassing incident. I turn the light back on, opened the door, and my jaw dropped. a Group of what seemed to be 50+ characters gathered across my lawn all jumping left and right with simultaneously while forming the L shape with their hands. I yelled at the kids, slammed the door and ripped off my costume. What have I done. 30 minutes later my son comes home and I guess word travels quickly in a small community, he already knew what happened. He didn't even make eye contact with me, I tried asking how trick or treating went and he ignored me, went up to his room and slammed the door. He hasn't talked to me since last night and I really don't know what to do.. I don't think he respects me anymore. homer sexual got him  me parents are fuqin nonces they like putting "RULES" on legit everything i wanna get its dumb so for example i buy headphones rules will be put in place for the headphones wanna buy a game they will put rules on that like a couple mins ago i asked for a legit credit card and there like NAH youll have restrictions and im like shut the fuck up youve already put rules on my phone, laptop, most shit i own and i dont even listen to the rules cos there that fucking stupid like one rule for my phone is "dont bring your phone to any place except home and school" like what type of gayass bullshit is that but ofc i dont listen then there like O_O and try to fuck me then i make them realise just how retarded the rules they make are.

---
Hmm. All the references to Eros Blossom on eveonline.com say that the SKIN was released during Guardian's Gala but only available from the store. It was to celebrate Valentine's Day.
---
Fair. So more then 1 medium citadel is a nono. How about sticks. Not for parking Dreads but just general discouragement of enemies. This would be a farther down the line thing once I've got some decent income coming in. But as far as your explanation goes they automate their own defence and can be a huge hassle if they're dickstars. Obviously they would have to give enough value to outweigh the added fuel cost.
---
Also. Wouldn't 2 citadel with opposite reinforce timers be a giant fuck you too any eviction entity or is that just inviting another time zone entity to harass me? 
---
i am going to miss stories like these.  POS are always a source of entertainment like this xD  bumping~

Speaking as the resident weeb here, I cannot condone furries in EVE. Please change to an actual anime mascot or see yourself out. &lt;3
---
Agreed. There's just something about living in a POS once in a while.
---
1. Do not start such discussions in the first place if you are not prepared for the possible outcome.
---
2. I rarely see supermodel / professionaly styled women in my day to day live and i mentioned something about going to a family trip, so your comment about tits was inappropiate in the first place.
---
3. There is a distinct difference in between the beauty of women and space stuff. Both are beautiful in their own way.
---
4. Even here in Germany, where there are liberties in that regard, public nudity is restricted to certain designated areas and in fact are a punishable offense in the rest of the public places.
---
5. I never said i prefer Reddit-Tits to real life tits, i was mearly pointing out that if i had a desire to see tits, i could do it rather easily instead of hoping for a chance encounter.
---
Just redo it. 
---
Size matters more than most people realise.
---
So firstly if you're going for site times, shorter warps means faster overall isk/he and more cap. But wait...there is more!
---
Doing PI? It's faster with a smaller hole!
---
Scanning? Faster in a smaller hole!
---
Running to or from a fight...that's right! Faster in a smaller hole.
---
Dscan is more effect9ce in a smaller hole, unless you're trying to hide ;)
---
Also rumours have it that the personal you sexually prefer (hey it's 2019) dig smaller holes
---
If you run a site in one system, it spawns somewhere else in the same region. There is 100% value in learning which regions are more active when choosing a hole to run homesites in. Some regions are more valuable than others when it comes to purchasing C5s. For example, TDSIN own a lot of 5/3 holes in r27, which makes it a pretty nice region to set up in. There's also regions such as r25 with no shattered holes, and therefore a faster site respawn rate.
---
Your username doesn’t check out.
---
Much as I appreciate your advocacy for battleships in general, I think that you're neglecting the racial flavour of Amarr with several of your suggested fixes, and your push for 5 mid Amarr BS. Amarr BS, like Caldari, are by design supposed to struggle outside of a fleet context.  Where Caldari can sacrifice tank for tackle and still make it work, Amarr are slot bound so lose mobility or control, but maintain the durability. You risk eroding the niche that is supposed to exist (debateable if it does of course) for Gallente and Minmatar ships, whose projection and  durability doesn't scale as well in a fleet context.
---
This all said, I think giving it an even more massive cap pool to give it longer time to cap-out would be a good change, but this ship was really designed for aug/guard cap support. A durable cap/armor transfer-bonused battleship that is designed to fill this fleet tender role without needing a cap chain would be a more interesting addition to round out the Amarr BS line in my view.
---
Very cheap considering the skin...
---
I can use a custom resolution with other games so I already had it.  
---
man you need to chill, and everyone else who commented also need to chill, yall need to chill the fuck out this is a game, we re here to have fun only :)
---
The skin is owned by the pilot who flew it to safety, they aren't attached to the ship.
---
&gt; Like Feroxes facing decloaking bomb bombers on them.
---
MJDs were explicitly created as a counter to bombs because bombs were oppressive, especially how 10 guys in bombers could show up to a fight they weren't even part of and delete a fleet. Now bombing requires work to remove the support ships and putting something on the field with some risk attached.
---
Well, in this case it should really just be a piecewise linear fit. I also did think about a log fit to get close to that but implementing the polyfit was just easier and at this scale it behaves more or less like the underlying trend anyway because of how 4th degree polynomials are shaped (enough extrema to approximate here)
---
Really what I should have done was use two piecewise lines (1d poly) but having to figure out what part of the damage to call the ramp-up and what to call the ceiling is a bit harder.
---
I'm not super great at stats and didnt want to spend that much time in the end.

Great response haha. How worth it do you think it is to just buy a holes location from somrone. Finding the right hole is a very long task and last time buying the info worked out well and I wasn't scammed. 
---
check the name of your region. if ti's begin by A-XXXXXX it's a C1, B-XXXXXX it's a C2 etc...
---
if you pay atention about the color of the WH before to jump in, you can knowing the class before jumping in
---
I think it's constellation based, but not 100%. If it is in any way geographically related, just make sure that you're triggering (initiating warp) to all the anime in all the holes you run into that youre not farming. this will cause those sites to despawn after 3 days, leaving a theorytically higher chance for you to have the anom respawns be in your hole.
---
Good to know! Love the examples!! Thanks!! 
---
I totally agree...sort of the foundation of my original post.
---
Minor tweak: Stack hits 5 debuffs, broken.
---
i was reinforcing your statement more than contradicting it
---
&gt; You're right it's not how to fight you. Because you don't fight ships with guns unless you out class or way out number them.
---
Sometimes we surprise even ourselves by taking the occasional fight. Last one was two real good brawls with Black Legion :) That doesn't get talked about though because it's much more fun to spin things negatively.
---
To be honest it all depends on who is online. There are certain people in Pirat that I want nothing to do with if they try to encourage people to form for a fight or brawl. Our senior guys like Luukje, Khromius, and Natural Clonekiller are the FC's that I personally feel comfortable around. So late USTZ when it's only me and a few other dudes and we see a cruiser fleet roll down the pipe, there's not much of an urge to entertain that. Lots of thoughts rolling through our minds such as, "Is this bait? Is there a fleet logged off on the gate that we missed?" So you'll see 10-20 Pirat characters and alts in and around Jita, but the actual number of unique pilots is far FAR from that.
---
&gt; You have a very romanticized idea of what you do. I'm not asking you to pay penance for killing a new bro by lining up your instalock brick tank vindis. I'm just happy someone can end a war now because war deccers have been abusing an ignored mechanic for a very long time.
---
Ultimately I enjoy what I do. I like being an actual Mercenary that people from all areas of space pay to do things. Sure some of them are super lame like fucking structure timers 23 jumps away, but money talks man. I guess it's interesting to me feeling like I serve a purpose and play within a group that shares the same sentiment.
---
I will be honest with you and say that there are plenty of people in Pirat that are just here to farm retards. That's cool and all, but I agree with the general sentiment that there's not much difference between them and a ganker that goes criminal.
---
&gt; There's nothing more frustrating than hearing a new player lost their Plex bought stuff to an unavoidable, unendable, whack a mole scheme at a trade hub. Yes they ignored a logistics service, yes they learned a lesson, and yes it's all legal in the game. But it doesn't make the game appealing to anyone except you.
---
I see merit in this statement because I know how it feels to be a new player tasked with trying to learn this daunting game. My personal hope is that corps and alliances that wrangle in these new players are doing due diligence 
---
&gt; I think deep down you can acknowledge your tactics of retreating as a war deccer are more along the lines of "guns on ship + didn't undock from jita = flee" than "we only take fair or unbalanced fights in our favor"
---
I think it depends on the situation that I explained above. If we have all right right people online that are capable of actual combat then we'll do our best to entertain the fight. We win some and we lose some.
---
Being scammed sucks.
---
With regard to buying a hole, I would simply say - if you are overly particular and lack the resources to evict some one or the time to find that right hole, buying is an option.
---
As it stands right now I would say wormholes are not so populated that finding a/the hole is beyond s small groups grasp.
---
Shoot me a mail/message in game and we can chat (I don't sell holes)
---
So you want people to return to using kitey nano shit fleets?
---
As much as I agree with the burning out of the bubble thing, I just don't think the Abaddon really fits the role of solo/small gang (Which I presume you're talking about as that seems to be your primary engagement type). As a whole the ship, it's bonuses and stats are almost entirely geared towards fleet combat - in particular close to mid range. And although it would be nice to have the speed to manoeuvre around easier without sacrificing it's cap stability, I don't think it would really matter that much, at least enough to make it viable in that solo/small gang playstyle.
---
This combined with the fact that for not much more you can afford to buy a Bhaal, which is alot more versatile than the Abaddon, with lr webs and pretty much no cap issues, it just doesn't really make sense to use an Abaddon, at least compared to its counterparts in solo/small gang.
---
Delete local.
---
Trig pod would be nice.
---
Esp for those of us who find ourselves in pods a lot. 
---
As for towers, putting a fueled and defended tower can discourage people from shooting it because they are quite annoying but really most people just put dead ones on moons to make it harder for someone to set up a forward operating base, but this is likely overkill for you.
---
As for two opposite timers, honestly, most groups are looking for easy bashes, just properly fit your astrahus and you’ll discourage 90% of people. The remaining 10% won’t be discouraged by a second timer and likely will have the time zone coverage that it doesn’t matter.
---
Might want to check the patch notes, shield boost from seidge is queuing to be cut in half 
---
Interesting. Didn't know it's that many...
---
Well, I guess it's more that it wa's supposed to be a bit of a limp fish without a support fleet - the damage and projection it has combined with its durability lent it a strong role in armor gangs with a strong logi component and independent tackle. It was intended to struggle for mids, if you gave it another mid (as in one of your suggested changes) that would just be straightforward power creep in my opinion.
---
If you make it 5 then you nerf excavator booshing. 7 was a carefully chosen number for that reason.
---
I guess I can live with it but im just tired of being collateral damage for sov null warfare balance issues.
---
The 4th degree poly was used because it could be conveniently implemented and most closely approximate the piecewise linear trend underlying the data without knowing where the damage ramp-up ends. This isnt really a research report, just a cool side project.
---
Normalizing by hit type brought the 5 trends together and removed the effect of that variable, which leaves the base hit damage. Variable transversal is not an issue for a Leshak sitting still and hitting a structure. There were no missed hits in the log.
---
It looks like I did in the final graph because I uploaded the wrong one now that I look at it, I had two datasets, leshak and leshak2. If you notice, the timescale is different. I'll fix the linked graph to leshak2 in my comment later.
---
This is your daily reminder that if people loved wormhole mechanics they would live in wormholes already.
---
In my job interview I had to convinve my boss that I am able to speak english.

That's pretty crazy, was it arty mach?

Eve is a spreadsheet plug-in. 🤫
---
We need another anime war
---
I was just poking fun and specifically said 5 to mess with you booshing. Sometimes we gotta laugh at ourselves and have fun on our game.
---
Hmm. Dead sticks definitely seems like a great plan for farther down the road. 40 dead sticks on 40 moons would make me swipe left on my WH if I was someone else browsing through WH tinder. 
---
Clades disagree (as some lore dude said on the forums, there's one clad who is not against the use of drones ) but this video suggest that some kind of higher organization above the 3 clades reached the conclusion that drones are bad.
---
look, you are welcome to WTM fleets whenever you want my man, come make isk, have fun thats all what its about dont take anything personal. this said now i have to say this reddit you made here is only drama making sorry to say that :)
---
im saving a lot of sp for a rainy day, have 2mil banked on my main atm
---
You also see when you used PLEX for a month of subscription.
---
Nope leshak. It only has one gun so when it gets a wrecking shot multiplier, it applies 3x damage to one gun, which is all of the leshaks dps.
---
We will give up hyperspatials for extra cargo. It's a decent nerf but not a complete defeater.

---
I hope they just keep pos as an anchorable forcefield. Or at least give citadels the option for a forcefield instead of tethering.
---
TN Whiskey is just poorly made bourbon. 
---
i still dont understand why those sp were gifted to the highest sp character, the one character you need it the least. instead of making them redeemable just like in the events...
---
There are quite a few goons that already do that, even without the implants available right now.
---
Is the SP because of the chat issues? Because I am not really understanding how not being able to safely Rorq mine while your intel bots spot people 10 jumps out in local would affect SP.
---
Connections to shattered holes appear regularly, except when you are *trying* to find one.  
---
Judging by [this](http://anoik.is/systems?systemclass=barbican,c1,c13,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6,conflux,redoubt,sentinel,thera,vidette&amp;staticdest=&amp;effect=_unfiltered&amp;shattered=_all), a C13 is a particular type of shattered system, probably the frigate-only variety, and there are only a 25 of them. Perhaps a wormholer will comment.
---
maxed out sp in no time!
---
There are of course better, more expensive bourbons.
---
But I agree, at the price point Booker's can't be beat.

I'm looking into WH exploration using something like an Astero. I toyed around with it a little bit on a lower-skilled alt that was promptly decimated by a camper looking to gank explorers. What's the safest strategy for being able to run something like a relic site, in WH space with possible gankers? Especially if you're flying solo? If I'm in an Astero and so are they, I kind of assume the higher-skilled player who gets the jump wins. Should I just align before I start working the site, and jump out if anybody decloaks? 
---
1. You werent asking last Sunday when fleeing around Fountain from ~30 Retributions for 2 hours.

The problem is: i find it sometimes hard to tell in writen words (especially as english is not my native language) what people exactly mean. I have a general rule to not take stuff on the internet too serious, but in this case:
---
I simply did not expect a comments on TITS on a thread about Internet Spaceships, so... pardon me if i did not see the joke here.
---
That said, no hard feelings from my side, but i think we should stop here and prevent it to get any uglier. I also do not have a fetish as you describe it in your last comment about anal penetration, but in general i try to not judge people as long as they do not try such things on me.
---
Have a nice day o7
---
Ahh thanks, of course it is. 
---
Done that, waiting in HS for something, and realising I'm pinging dscan for no real reason several minutes later...!
---
Cool thing about petes, they shoot to 220km, So get infront of the boosh fleet..... eve is not this hard
---
&gt;Brisc Rubal wants to know your location.
---
Fine, I give up. Spy on me.
---
aye.  hate tethering so much....like i get the idea, but in effect it gives to much of an advantage.
---
I'd do 1, then see.
---
what the fucking fuck? stop huffing glue dude
---
Nice, that's like a net gain of like, what are supers now? 500m?
---
While the 500k SP is great, It has been a problem for a year that has impacted things.  People other than those subscribed for that duration have been effected.
---
Here’s a fit for killing explorers. Carry a mobile depot and swap out a couple mid slot mods for a relic analyzer and a cargo scanner when you want to hack relics. This a brick tank and it’s lethal. Only real bling is the Caldari Navy Warp scram, which has three points to catch most stabbed explorers. You cannot go wrong with this fit. Some will argue in favor of a Damage Control II rather than the Reactive Armor Hardener, but realistically most people you encounter who you can kill won’t be packing multiple types of damage. If they are savvy enough to stymie the RAH with different types of damage they will probably kill you anyway. If you get in a fight with another Astero, kill its drones first. It may be a long fight but be patient and you will have the upper hand and defang him. Good luck!

So we both had a good joke. Feels wrong. I'm going back to the sidelines where I yell "Bad Olmeca grr!"
---
We were getting the same local problems last night, just like before.  
---
I feel the easy fix would be to just get rid of the damage bonus altogether and having a substantial capacitor bonus of some kind (paladin-style would be awesome, but even a -cap usage for lasers could do) and more room for fitting (cough tachyons cough).  Also tank + cap would make it stand out, as the Geddon would fit in the drones + neuts theme, apoc would be the dps machine, and abaddon would become the durability option.
---
It's ok. In the grand scheme of things, these kind of text based issues are minor. But sometimes important.

I just checked my accounts, none of them have any additional SP. The only one that have over 500k unallocated is account that i just train and throw in there all free SP over the time that i get and never use (so he also didn't get any free sp).

Yeah, I figured it'd be at the Indigo (smaller venue inside the dome) if it were at the O2.

Not announced yet, AFAIK, but they are planning on running another abyssal event (was Aug/Sept last year, so about then) and might be linked to that.

For sure.

---
&gt;Last one was two real good brawls with Black Legion :) That doesn't get talked about though because it's much more fun to spin things negatively.
---
It's spun because it's an abysmally low percentage of what was deccers do. 
---
&gt;To be honest it all depends on who is online. There are certain people in Pirat that I want nothing to do with if they try to encourage people to form for a fight or brawl. Our senior guys like Luukje, Khromius, and Natural Clonekiller are the FC's that I personally feel comfortable around. So late USTZ when it's only me and a few other dudes and we see a cruiser fleet roll down the pipe, there's not much of an urge to entertain that.

So you'll see 10-20 Pirat characters and alts in and around Jita, but the actual number of unique pilots is far FAR from that.

Gankers have to balance cost of their lost ship and the loot they get. You do not.
---
&gt;I see merit in this statement because I know how it feels to be a new player tasked with trying to learn this daunting game. My personal hope is that corps and alliances that wrangle in these new players are doing due diligence 
---
We did, but with constant flows of new players mean you're getting people losing all their money. A reminder from our end that they could have avoided is true, but it doesn't make the game anymore accessible or fun to a new person. 
---
Wait, DT is still active? 
---
Informative : I have 10 accounts active now, five of them qualify for the 500k bonus and only receive in one. The problem of the filter is very complex (number is number of payment, one of each account) and i receive 1/5 of the five. Problem in algorithm i assume. Case of examples, one for account:

M8, this is nothing. I could build wall of texts that would solve Trumps Wall problems. Wanna see them?
---
They don't all have it, but some do have the drifters &amp; explosion based on timer and/failure, even in high sec.
---
The damage in a high sec one is not as high as a low sec one, which is again not as high as a null sec one (and think WH is greater again). So the exact same 'level' of site will have a weaker explosion in a 0.5 than in a 0.4. Fairly sure the logic is to let newbies get familiar with the mechanics of the timers, explosions, etc. without losing ships before they encounter the harsher versions in lower security space, hence it's a scary explosion and attack, but not genuinely dangerous.
---
Or an alt/buddy in a fast frigate that distracts the response fleet while you murder all the barges in their safe spot.
---
Was a good fleet! Wasn't there also a ship inside we liberated??
---
Well join imperium. Easy fix. 
---
Yeah although wrecking shots don't happen often, but regardless you are getting some good 5-10k vollies on the norm :)
---
It is constellation based as far as I know.
---
As part of my efforts with Einstein-Rosen Brigade I seeded all of the systems in constellation with home hole with alpha scanners a year or two back.
---
I haven't used it in ages, but after I got it set up and warped/cancel warped to all the anoms regularly for a week or so, there were definitely more spawns in home than before.
---
Maybe randomness, maybe voodoo magic, maybe the actual mechanic.
---
Exactly its one of the strongest battleships to use in a fleet setting if you feed it cap when it needs it.
---
Idd rather get a job and play both
---
All agreeable points.
---
There are always outliers though, even on the caldari side (nosprey, drake navy, raven, navy raven are all good/decent at things other than fleets). Its not that im saying "redesign the entire amarr BS line-up so they can all solo and dump their fleet roles". 
---
Its more of, have at least 1 amarr laser battleship that has some flexibility. Even the navy harbinger has more mids than their battleships. Its an outlier in a field of 3-4 mid laser cruisers/battlecruisers and command ships. It doesnt discredit Amarr's fleet focused ships, but does give the medium ship line some needed variety.
---
Perhaps the Abaddon is the wrong ship to try to make it more flexible. The Navy Geddon is probably the better alternative to try to do something unique with.
---
Abaddon still needs a capacitor tweak.
---
FUCKING GUYS IN TEMPLIS COULDN'T TAKE A SINGLE GODDAMN SCREENPRINT SO WE COULDN'T HAVE A SIMILAR POST ON THE FRAT NYX WE STOLE. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

There is only really one thing to come out of this Abaddon pass, I think, and that is its viability as a semi-afk laser-brick structure basher for a fleet already packing Guardian support.
---
I've always been partial to Basil Hayden.
---
As far as I can tell from my experience (also this has been confirmed by some other guys):  
---
It seems that SP were given out once per registration email, not once per Omega account.  
---
One of my friends has 2 accounts tied to the same email address and the 3rd one tied to different email. And guess what? He got SP on 2 accounts. One of the accounts with the matching email did not get SP.  
---
Speaking for myself - I have 2 accounts tied to the same email and I got SP only once.

---
Wait for a big sale, or just pay for the subscription and don't bother grinding.  
---
5 mids I think is asking a little too much
---
What I would like to see is some viable path to utilize a low slot and a rig slot to attain at least some form of cap... maybe not stability, but making it less awful
---
I've always felt on paper that Amarr should have the liberty to sacrifice a little tank in exchange for more cap power, but the way the modules are balanced right now it's just not realistic. There's way too much disparity between the best cap mods and the "worst"...
---
If this were possible, then all 4 mids could be used for Good Stuff, and presents real fitting choices for pilots
---
&gt; This is a problem of your own creation. If you guys didnt spam war Decs to literally any corp capable of fielding a cruiser you could chill on your paranoia.
---
I'm not complaining about the dynamic of being in an alliance with around 80 wars rolling. I accept the fact that sometimes we're outmatched, and that's cool. The reason we have so many wars is to curb the loss of content through a decreasing player count and players being immune to war either in an NPC corp or in a player-owned corp. It felt much more alive and viable back in 2013 when I was doing solo and small group wars. 5-8 wars coupled with the watchlist and locator agents gave me plenty to do and entertain.
---
&gt; I don't have issues with this, but this is not what most people know PIRAT as.
---
Before we merged into Pirat we were known as Vendetta Mercenary Group. We "owned" Jita before partnering up with the Russians in Pirat and formed what we have now. Again CCP and players have created this monster that we have now.
---
- Decreased player count making it more worthwhile to hunt near the watering hole
---
- Players increasingly begging CCP to nerf or change wardecs and mechanics that make it better to be a hunter (war costs, removal of watchlists, and so on).
---
The more we are the subject to targeted or inadvertent nerfs, the more we adapt... until we are in the form in which we are right now. The absolutely crazy part is that along the years people from the wardec community have warned CCP and the entire community about what varying changes will do and how people will adapt. Turns out that what has been done is like throwing water on a grease fire.
---
&gt; Gankers have to balance cost of their lost ship and the loot they get. You do not.
---
You are incorrect in thinking that all we do is haze idiots in Jita. We absolutely do things that require more risk than that mentioned.
---
&gt; We did, but with constant flows of new players mean you're getting people losing all their money. A reminder from our end that they could have avoided is true, but it doesn't make the game anymore accessible or fun to a new person.
---
The past is in the past imo, but now you have an opportunity to have a feeder corp  / alliance that is immune to wardecs. Require your new recruits to stay there until they learn most of the necessary stuff. That's the easiest solution.
---
i heard they didnt, cause goonies held horde busy, true?\^\^
---
&gt;Currently, super ratting, VNI ratting, rorqual mining has been making life easier for players like me who could only spend an hour or two everyday after work.
---
Ironically it's also what's been driving the PLEX prices up. Easy access to isk means more people buying PLEX, less people selling PLEX. The fact that people are adding more and more capital alts to their portfolio doesn't help either. They scale so much better than subcaps do.
---
When I started the game plex was about 300m .. the price is increasing for a while now .. so nothing new 
---
That's exactly how I used to do them, and it works
---
I like how people don't expect mods in this sub reddit to abuse their powers.. They are after all eve players.
---
Same thing happened to me with the Machariel Angel's Hex SKIN. It was listed in the market but there was no way to obtain one for several months. Eventually it was bundled with one of the packs you pay RL money for, and later it was added to the NES.

Ah yes, the Osmon King searches for his prey. Interesting how local started messing up over the course a few hours.  I assume this issue is still ongoing?  I restarted my client and it seemed to correct itself-ish. Thought it was a local problem to me, turns out its CCP Broken.

I did see peeps in local in wormhole! i thought my game was glitched.. in a good way!  "Whoo, I can see who's in a wormhole!, oh the possibilities!" but nah.. remnants of old players from local.  I really need a win... been having a rought couple years.
---
OMG SHUT UP
---
&gt; Why would anyone should wait with skill queue or other aspects of the game just because of this?
---
That is pretty much the point: we saw the current state of the game (including chat issues) and decided it was still worth the cost of subscribing. 
---
If someone thought the issues made it not worth the price tag, they would not subscribe. Hence, we all had the chance to value Omega status based on current game state at the time, and thus got what we expected when paying. We deserve nothing more than we have already got.
---
Meanwhile, those who subscribed prior to the chat issues made their evaluation based on one state, and then received something lesser. Did someone who subscribed on the 19th March come back on the 21st and go "damn, I wouldn't have paid had I known this was coming!"? Maybe, maybe not, but they are the only ones who can claim that they got less than expected from their subscription, and who had that option to evaluate the state of the game correctly, so they are the only ones who deserve some kindness to make up for it.

You join a nullsec space guild that has 0-2% tax factory planets.

What if it was a matter of 12 hours of cloak time in fuel that you could carry?
---
They are on independent chains. Shield/Armor/Hull and Capacitor Transfers all have their own separate diminishing returns. 
---
Fuck code 
---
I think its more of the fact that if you were a good rorq pilot you basically never died. With this update you can be the best damn pilot in New Eden and you will still probably die, even with fleet backup. And now it will REALLY hurt the little guy who just saved up enough for one rorq.
---
Rorqs need nerfs, no doubt about it, but this feels like a kick in the crotch rather than a love tap.
---
50% reduction in local rep is nuts.
---
&gt; each one is selling for 2.3m, but just the cost of transferring a SINGLE wetware mainframe from planet to customs office will cost 1.2mil.
---
maybe consider doing your PI on a planet that doesnt have a 50% tax on the customs office
---
Also, be sure to calculate all of your taxes, and move from “I think” to “I know”. Welcome to Spreadsheets Online :tm:
---
They lack the low slots to be dual tanked while still keeping damage mods, unlike armor
---
Basically armor ships can benefit from shield reps, but for most if not all shield ships armor reps are of little to no use at all, disproportionately affecting shield supers.
---
The ramifications of this are astounding.  If somehow we can all prove that perhaps, in and of itself, we TOO are all victims of the ongoing chat issue, not just pre Mar 20 ppl, they may have no choice but to grant us all the power of free SP.  IF only there was some sort of collective of people in positions to help, like a council of sorts.. hmm that deal with the management of all this space stuff and speak on our behalf.. like a stellar team of people.  Bah any who.
---
However, having intact armor plates dropping is also going to attract a lot of random explorers. Goons will certainly have an advantage at getting the loot, but there will be plenty of competition from explorers in other alliances. 
---
Corax is mis-utilized. It's best feature is the raw damage bonus it gets (not rof), which if exploited is quite powerful in a group.

Unfortunately most people try to Rocket fit (which is ok sometimes) or use it like a slow talwar.

In reality is more like a thrasher with better base ehp.

yes it is inevitable i guess.. their statement in form of  the XIX fort or the  joining from origin is pretty clear in my opinion.. and to be honest, its what a lot of ppl want(including me :P)..

Making titan dps &lt;= 10 frigate dps is something not understandable for me.
---
When I started playing in 2010 it was always my dream to participate in large fleets using capital ships 
---
but seeing the direction ccp going I just don't see any reason to train\fly anything bigger then a battleship.
---
- Killing citadels is pain (and due to dmg cap there is often no reason to bring more then destroyers\cruisers)
---
- Ratting with capitals will be nerfed so why invest in carrier\super\titan if you can do same isk using few VNI in afk and don't mind loosing it even to rats.
---
- Given limited time to play (weekends) there is just no incentive to join whatever fleet to spend 1 hour for forming + traveling and additional 30 min (3 times) to kill undefended astrahus which cost like 3 battleships. Actual fights happens so rare because you can spam citadels so easily and even if you attack something like keepstar defenders will just move their staff out during reinforcement timer.
---
- There is no fight directly on the citadel against PLAYERS  due to PDS (it wipes out small ships\fighters, so you neither can tackle neither use the whole ship class)
---
With this new changes I just don't see how we suppose to use capitals except this one yearly fight during which loosing side start to extract when it lose like 5% of its assets. And then... fozzie sov... And again frigates online.
---
Given all that I just don't see any reason to login and actually play the game because the fun element for me (capital fights mostly) is just deleted from the game.
---
More zombie terrorists.
---
Yeah, I mean, strictly speaking, the Navy Harb is pure heresy and should never have been born, only Amarr ships &gt;4 mids are acceptable on are EWAR ships :P
---
More seriously I think the Geddon Navy is a great choice for a more solo-capable Amarr BS, and though the Apoc Navy finally doesn't have a 10% cap cost, 5% cap pool bonus set, it still also lacks pizzazz.
---
I'd love to see a DHP renaissance with perhaps tracking and damage bonuses but insufficient grid to comfortably fit MP and reps on the Navy Geddon with maybe 7/5/7 slot layout, and keeping the 125tb bandwidth, with perhaps 150m3 drone bay.
---
It's like camping. In space. 
---
Do you krab to plex to krab some more? if so, why bother playing at all.
---
afraid?  wormholers are like vampires, they feed on victims in the night, away from all the lights and shiny things known as h.s..  Only be afraid if you go *into* a wormhole.  The TRENCH (WH btw) will grab you when you least expect it! :p
---
People would just run the sites in a cheap ship so you could kill it &amp; get the mods. Just like run in the cheapest possible thing, insure &amp; wintrade.
---
What is dead can never die... 
---
because either:
---
1) rep diminish respects separate tank types and is tracked separately. then you can split your 400 fax to half armor and half shield for your armor fleet and be reduced much less than if you kept all 400 on armor. put some invulns on your avatar, whatever. but healing armor on shield supers doesn't do anything at all, so shield loses here
---
2) it is one debuff that takes both tank types into account at once. so you can put armor reps on hostile shield supers to reduce their incoming shield reps. shield could out shield reps on hostile armor supers, but that actually helps them instead of healing zero. shield loses here too
---
the solution: incoming rep calculation for determining dimished effectiveness does not take overhealing into account, then do not split the debuff. 
---
You want a cap stable 3 heatsink abaddon with a point.

1212 dps with drones, 31.8% stable, can fit scram or long point. Although personally I'd drop the 3rd heatsink for a Imp navy 1600mm plate. Which with the update keeps around the same dps and actually gives the ship a viable tank.   
---
Well, this is a thing we definatly have in common than my friend.
---
I’m ok with there being a nerf to cloaking, but I don’t think fuel would work. Maybe capacitor cost, which would equalize it a bit and force cloaky campers to sacrifice tank for batteries. 
---
excellent.  
---
This is what i had hoped. Thank you for clarifying. 
---
yea youre right I am shitting on you pretty hard
---
it caused a few ratters to die or not log in - that's not that big of a deal.

---
How can you be so sure that those aren't people cloaked somewhere in your system?
---
Well, the Trig is one collective, but 3 clans. 
---
So collectively they disagree about the drones. Perune finds the drones useful and some have even bonded to the Drones in a way. While the Svarog does not trust them at all and has deployed suppressors to destroy them.

Maybe they’ll add shield slaves as a balancer? They said something aboutbmore implants
---
The idea ive had for the navy geddon was this:
---
-1 Turret and Hi
---
+1 Mid
---
10% laser damage bonus per level
---
5% bonus to armor hitpoints per level
---
This gives it a unique niche that isnt already occupied and also brings progression in line from navy aug to navy geddon. Losing a turret also frees up fitting and cap.
---
Retain the drone mb and maybe a slightly larger bay. Its dps may not be super high, but it will be very flexible fun to brawl around in.
---
I'd like a T-rex! 
---
Its a great change but the meta probably wont change much in the next few months. Caps are still really good (bosons, sirens/dromis, fax tank, etc) and panic is still a long 6 minutes. So yeah. Cool patch but I doubt much will change because of this. 
---
Small players and HAW titans were in the post but not related. :P
---
Can we get some COMMS DISCIPLINE in here?! Everybody trying to talk at once, jesus
---
Fit for align speed. Most asteros camping a site are going to have a 5 sec timer before they can start targeting something after decloaking, but you can get your astero down to a 2 sec align time. As long as you are paying attention and start warping when they decloak you should get away from anything that's not a stealth bomber or bubbler. Stealth bombers you can easily solo as long as you keep your speed up and send light drones after him, and bubblers (usually sabers) are rare in WH space. Sabers are much more common in NS, particularly Stain. Another thing is  to not MWD directly straight to a can, because when you eventually ram it you will bounce which means in that moment you have a significantly longer align time, which is a great chance for a hunter to grab you. Instead you should orbit the can at 2400m so you can either cloak or loot without changing position.  
---
It is also entirely possible to win that fight. Many astero pilots assume other asteros aren't fit for combat, as many aren't. If you fit a normal dual rep astero, and focus on defanging you opponent you can usually force the other astero off, or even out right kill them. I've seen people hunt asteros in their magnate or heron, many explorer hunters aren't as experienced as you think they are. 
---
Maybe 10isk trot?
---
Didn't get anything on any account. Not upset, about what I've come to expect out of CCP.
---
just a stilleto :(

Heck yeah, I guess I should but honestly, never had a mind crooked enough to scam naive people! I guess that makes me naive too!  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
They lost a nyx too
---
Trust me, I get the internet because the whole family gets to use it! xD 
---
Great. The second graph is now from a completely different data set. And the fact that you're not writing a paper doesn't make it better. It's bad modelling to use a forth polinomial in this context. It is obvious that you played around with several degrees and well fourth kinda looked good. On another data set for example if you turn the turrets off and a bit later on again it will completely fail.
---
&gt; Normalizing by hit type brought the 5 trends together and removed the effect of that variable, which leaves the base hit damage. Variable transversal is not an issue for a Leshak sitting still and hitting a structure. There were no missed hits in the log. 
---
It deletes the information about the true damage dealt. As I pointed out above to see the ramp up is already easily visible on the simple graph. Just look at the linear behaviour of the peaks. Simply putting two lines through the plot by hand is actually more proper than a wrong fit.  
---
I'd suggest that you read [http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf](http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf) you might not be lost, yet.
---
Its because if you resubbed after this date, then you subbed knowing the chat issue existed (or had the ability to know) whereas if you were subbed prior it was done after you were subbed and in turn forced you into dealing with it.  Its not arbitrary.  Also get over it you whiny nerds.  Local shouldnt exist anyway.
---
Epic.  Thanks for the share!
---
Feeling the same way mate!
---
I have seen a lot of people mention rorqs needing depots and got the impression it was for drones. Do rorqs not have enough dronebay space for a full flight?
---
Hel for 15 bil in 2k19? Damn, scam and a steal 😂
---
Got it on one of four accounts, at least three of which were definitely subbed on the right date.
---
Alpha access to EVE 2
---
Not if it was donated from another acct.  No record of that shows up in transaction history.  Also I don't think straight plex for yourself is showing up either since the NES.
---
We're the scalies of eve. They better start welcoming us Lizard Overlords. 
---
I'm a medium-intensity weeb. But even I know that gathering a shitton of us in one place in an online game is an insufferable concept.
---
When rorqs get attacked, the pilot will stow their excavator drones in a mobile depo so if the rorq dies, they don't lose the drones.
---
The incoming increase in excavator size means that you can no longer fit all of a rorq's drones in a single mobile depot.
---
"smaller players" ... "super ratting" ... lol
---
Crabs like you are the main reason the PLEX price is skyrocketing. So sorry if I can't really muster any sympathy for your whiny ass.
---
you didn't answer my question
---
If I understood it correctly the diminishing returns is not based on number of reps, but rep amount. If that is true number 2 is no longer the case as the armor reps for 0 armor would not contribute to the diminishing returns in any way. It seemed as if the graph was saying just numbers of reps but I believe the actual calculation was assuming reps healing for full amounts.
---
Maybe having PA at the steering wheel won't be so bad......

---
I was there. \*old reference
---
I can dig 6 turrets with utility high. I’d almost be tempted to drop a low for a second utility high as well actually, if you’re going for +armor hp as a bonus.
---
Also viable. If an armor HP bonus happens, id expect CCP to nerf base HP amount. So with lvl5 amarr BS, youd maybe only be at 10-15% more armor than you have now. Removing a low is also a good idea.
---
It's already been fixed. 
---
Oh I knew nothing of the horrors of chat pre resub I took time off to deal with my family that at the time was falling apart. I dont pay for my sub I play for it, so I dont stay subbed on breaks (which I rarely take) to much isk.
---
 But its fine let ccp arbitrarily piss on the players that dont have 30 rorq alts or an sp farm subbed all year. Just pisses me off that they wait this long to release the reimbursement for something that happened almost a fucking year ago that still effects us now.. And only give it to "the people effected" which by now is FUCKING ALL OF US omega or not. But sure ccp you have your own twisted logic. Hell maybe the little guy wont get kicked in the teeth next balance pass either.. Here to miracles!
---
It does, it was specified further down the page but a lot of people are missing that.
---
Yep, I have a character that is from 2005. I split him off onto a new account June. He had been MCTC'd at the date of this. Nothing.   
---
IMO, they should have picked a date every 3 months. If your character was active during this time, it would receive this bonus. CCP is having a Diablo moment with this one. 
---
If you lived in wormhole space... you would know....
---
But FFS what you propose is too much work.
---
When you’re done doing sites just warp to everyone else’s sites who connect to your chain. That’ll start their despawn timer &amp; they’ll spawn elsewhere in 6-7 days.
---
I think you forgot the most important point. Didn´t CCP want to nerf shields in general to make shield slaves not totally op? Or did that idea wander into the dumpster?
---
&gt;You may have enjoyed it, but rorquals are ruining the mineral economy
---
That's not exactly true, or at least we must enter in detail.  
---
Rorquals didn't ruined mineral economy, It's the excessive proliferation of rorquals that caused it.
---
It could seem a sligtly detail but it's important.  
---
Eve become Rorqual Online because of injectors, and we can say the same about supers or titans or capitals in general, we have an excessive proliferation of those because you don't need to wait years to use them, just pick your credit card and presto you have your 300M/hr tick in a Hel.  
---
More capital pilots means more request for capital, means more request for minerals, means more rorquals and so on and on in this gigantic inflation spiral...
---
There's a solution but it require hard steel balls and unpopular decisions to make, and honestly CCP don't have either the will and the balls to do this.
---
No, Sister Blizzz :)
---
CCP indicated that there is a plan to make sure you can't sabotage enemy fleets by repping them, wait until more comes out.
---
You all have phones right?
---
Why not? If ratting carriers and rorqs get nerfed it makes ns mission running more viable.
---
Isn't it funny how the more expensive a ship is, the more often the 'logs show nothing'?
---
Because they didn't ask for advice either. I could have corrected the statements they made incorrectly, like several other people did. I just picked the headline to correct. 
---
But there really is no ask for help in the post itself. Or asking how to do this or that. It's just a bunch of statements about how they do WH stuff. 
---
If I made a post called "I have questions about caps" and the post said "I use the cyno beacons" that's not a question, or a request for advice. It's bad gameplay but you'd expect a "is this a good idea?" or even a "tell me what to do better" 
---
I just found it somewhat funny the person made a thread saying they had questions, but never actually asked a question or made a request and corrected that part.
---
 If CCP gave 500k sp to everyone who was subbed after March 2018 and had to deal with the shitty chat servers they would be giving out sp to everyone who omegas an account until they get the chat servers fixed which will be April 1 2021 when the eve server is shut down for good. This would also cause the Injector market to crash and CCP doesnt want those sp farmers to sufffer.
---
i use abaddon in hs for structure bashing. with the new bonus it will outdps geddon navy issue. but hey, why not :P

Wait, I thought I heard this thing got reimbursed?
---
This article is actually garbage

Well they got a mega kick in the ass to skyrocket from unusable dumpster tier up to godlike in just one patch over 2 years ago.
---
A kick in the crotch is a fair start imo.
---
I just started playing and then read it and it enriched the whole experience... couldn't wait to be part of something that epic... and then I was thanks to the war last year :D
---
Globby have thousands      
---
You're incredibly condescending for someone who doesn't really get it. Could you like, chill?
---
&gt; It deletes the information about the true damage dealt
---
Yes, it does. I'm aware of that. The point of this is not to have a true damage graph including the randomness, it is to show the trend of ramp-up for the paper dps figure in action. Normalization isolates that figure.
---
I also never claimed the 4th polynomial fit was a statistically ideal or general solution. This is just something I made for a visualizing specific kind of log a friend produces.
---
Every wh players dream...
---
Not working since all the carebears need local to crab and if it does not they dont subscribe..
---
Again, why nerf Muninns?
---
how can i check if i was omega that day, how to check if i got the sp if i don't remember what was exact amount of my unallocated sp before this?
---
&gt;I'm not complaining about the dynamic of being in an alliance with around 80 wars rolling. I accept the fact that sometimes we're outmatched, and that's cool. The reason we have so many wars is to curb the loss of content through a decreasing player count and players being immune to war either in an NPC corp or in a player-owned corp. It felt much more alive and viable back in 2013 when I was doing solo and small group wars. 5-8 wars coupled with the watchlist and locator agents gave me plenty to do and entertain.
---
What content did my courier contract corp provide? A corp where no undocking occurs. It's purely a shotgun approach. The idea that the decreasing player count is an unfortunate thing and you adapted is funny because while you and other war deccers aren't the only reason but you are a reason. I've got shit to do in real life and don't need this game to be more of a job then a game. The lake is running dry and the people responsible are pointing fingers and demanding the same amount of water.
---
&gt;Before we merged into Pirat we were known as Vendetta Mercenary Group. We "owned" Jita before partnering up with the Russians in Pirat and formed what we have now. Again CCP and players have created this monster that we have now.
---
Which is why it's getting nerfed. Everyone's content is drying up and you're greatly underestimating how starved people are when it comes to bashing your structures. Null blocs will have high sec alts for when they can't find stuff and pop towers for content.
---
&gt;The more we are the subject to targeted or inadvertent nerfs, the more we adapt... until we are in the form in which we are right now. The absolutely crazy part is that along the years people from the wardec community have warned CCP and the entire community about what varying changes will do and how people will adapt. Turns out that what has been done is like throwing water on a grease fire.
---
I'd have preferred removing the ability entirely until they came up with an answer to force expediency but that's now how CCP works .
---
&gt;You are incorrect in thinking that all we do is haze idiots in Jita. We absolutely do things that require more risk than that mentioned.
---
As long as that's a big portion of player perception of you you're no different than the other greifers. I know you're trying to distance from them but it doesn't matter. All corps o have been in have been decced by PIRAT and we never once saw them anywhere but Jita.
---
&gt;The past is in the past imo, but now you have an opportunity to have a feeder corp  / alliance that is immune to wardecs. Require your new recruits to stay there until they learn most of the necessary stuff. That's the easiest solution.
---
I've given up on eve because my life got too busy to play anymore. I am very excited for others who help out new players have a source of content to end a war started to camp Jita.
---
shame that the hp game means nothing post change
---
all about resists now
---
also slaves will mean your shield super will have 5-10% more shield hp with them, and 20-30% less without them, so xd

From the [dev blog](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pny7eb/introducing-a-new-tech-demo-eve-aether-wars)

&gt; Be warned though, what you will be experiencing is not a game, it´s not even a prototype of a game. This is the raw Aether engine with EVE spaceship assets and some interaction dynamics, which are nothing like EVE Online or EVE: Valkyrie. CCP is providing our visual assets for use in the Aether Engine, enabling Hadean to focus on addressing the challenges we face with large-scale online multiplayer environments.

This thing is not run by CCP. The only involvement they have is giving a name and some assets.

---
That's total bullshit. Why didn't they distribute to each separate account? I have 4 separate accounts. They all should be awared the SP regardless of what email they're tied to.
---
43 omega accounts, Jesus christ lol
---
From what I've read, POS forcefields caused a lot of the badness of POS's. They added a lot of complexity to ship navigation - i.e. can a ship warp through one? 
---
&gt; And now it will REALLY hurt the little guy who just saved up enough for one rorq.
---
Hello, you must be new to EVE.
---
Yeah that's silly low side, they're honestly 25 if they have a decent fit and it's pvp
---
Here's a legit question.  
---
Can we get 10,000 players for EVE?  
---
30k people online = 5-7k players and all of their alts, cloaky campers, PI guys and skill farms online.
---
grrr
---
TFW you think titan haw nerf will affect us lmao
---
Have you seen what they’re selling for in Delve these days? 
---
Nah, aside from not being very timely, they did a decent job explaining in a way non-Eve players can understand. 
---
Reporter btw
---
The answer to this is easy, drop more titans. 
---
Except you did have to look to take that. Should've been a picture of nothing interesting in front of that ship.
---
The Abaddon is meant to be a fleet ship, tbh.
---
In the same way that a Ferox kinda sucks solo, some ships are going to thrive when tracking and utility aren't that important, and it's just a matter of big boy DPS at decent range with a heavy tank.
---
Improving it's capacitor so that lasers are viable as a weapon choice over artillery is a good idea, but extra midslots don't really matter for the abaddon in a Fleet combat role.
---
News to me! Not sure how they argued it, we were obviously not there to see the exact chain of events that caused it to bump out.
---
Its a joke middle of the week and 10k players?  🤪
---
Blantons Single Malt 
---
As long as it makes more subcap ratters I'll be happy I just want more blops targets tbh. With the vninerf maybe they will upgrade since dropping a 3bil blops on a 60mil vni isn't worth it.
---
Roughly how many wormholes are actually populated?
---
&gt;forth polinomial
---
god this sub is just full of the most entertaining people
---
Well, sure. Dromis are p tough to kill though.
---
that would be abused to hell for moving supers through hostiloe space
---
6 months from now: waaaaaaaaaah the same guys are still powerful! CCP nerf plz!
---
lol ... 50% damage reduction only hurts the people dropping a couple titans  
---
it's hilarious that people actually think these changes affect the blobs
---
How do we see if skill points were awarded?  
---
None of the top-SP characters on my accounts received a Notification about it, and I was not tracking whatever amount of free-SP they had previously accumulated, so I can't tell if the current total includes the 500k boost.
---
I'm pretty sure this guy talks to a larger amount of actually relevant Goons on a daily basis than you ever will.
---
Talk about being late to the party... 
---
Drones dont need to move far in havens, I reckon that it will probably just result in people pulling drones earlier or abandoning them.
---
But yeah I feel you with the blops thing. I want to try it again but I dont think its worth my time right now.
---
Idd rather someone else pay me while I troll reddit 
---
Well they still gotta make isk, so that just makes more content for the small gang fellas if more people are out and about in subcaps.
---
I'll take it!
---
Comments like this is what gets reddit banned at workplaces...
---
It’s not trolling if you’re dicking yourself over.
---
Probably Adhoc
---

5km hic scram bubble. 
---
Yesterday when I was on reddit everyone was praising CCP for the upcoming balance  and future updates how they have fixed eve. I dont see that same love today. What did CCP do since yesterday that killed all those good vibes and praise towards them?
---
Less now then there one was because a lot of low power structures have been cleared out. I'd say around 10-15% of all WHs have no structure in them, though most of these are holes with less desirable statics (try finding an empty C2 with C5/NS statics). That being said many WHs only have 1-3 people living there, or are only a farm hole of a bigger corp. The statistic I always hear repeated is that WHs consist of 25% of all eve systems, but only contain 10% of the player base. I can't verify the second part of that statement, but it certainly feels true.
---
&gt; What content did my courier contract corp provide? A corp where no undocking occurs. It's purely a shotgun approach. The idea that the decreasing player count is an unfortunate thing and you adapted is funny because while you and other war deccers aren't the only reason but you are a reason. I've got shit to do in real life and don't need this game to be more of a job then a game. The lake is running dry and the people responsible are pointing fingers and demanding the same amount of water.
---
I don't deny that wars have had a negative effect on retention, but really... what in Eve Online hasn't? CCP pulled on statistics on Wardecs because the CSM requested them. The data was presented in limited form at EVE Vegas and "STARK" results were shown, but where is the baseline? 
---
What do we compare it to? In my opinion I think dull PVE and a shitshow NPE have huge ramifications on player retention. What about CCP's preference to sit on their hands for months... years... before balancing and revamping stuff? So yes, surely Wardecs must obviously be the prime offender here. I don't deny our hand in it, but to act as if everyone else is innocent... pft!
---
&gt; Which is why it's getting nerfed. Everyone's content is drying up and you're greatly underestimating how starved people are when it comes to bashing your structures. Null blocs will have high sec alts for when they can't find stuff and pop towers for content.
---
I don't deny that Nullsec is shit and the content is stale. The point I was making is that Wardecs are in their current form because of the people whining to CCP for them to change it, while they can't think 3 steps ahead on how this will effect the meta. I realize that trying to develop and balance a sandbox game in which players have tons of influence on how it's played is complicated, but come on...
---
&gt; All corps o have been in have been decced by PIRAT and we never once saw them anywhere but Jita.
---
Should we be required to be somewhere specific?
---
&gt; I've given up on eve because my life got too busy to play anymore. I am very excited for others who help out new players have a source of content to end a war started to camp Jita.
---
Funny how it's people that have "quit" or "given up on eve" that are the vocal ones. I hate that you aren't playing, but really... what's it to you? Unless you're going to join the ranks that are allegedly going to make it impossible for us, then what are we doing here? We'll just have to see how it goes upon release :)
---
lol its a nerf to blops, less carriers/supers ratting, less 10/10 runners, good luck hunting 
---
Now that they have nerfed the potential income of supers I want plex prices to fall too! That is the whole idea of this post mate!
---
Whats a relevant goon these days?
---
Ok, I'm from Argentina, our economy is literally on the verge of colapse and paying for a suscription, although more expensive than in other countires, is not that prohibitive... so you are either full of bullshit or just trying to generate simpathy by speaking about your personal situation as if it was a general one. So cut the crap.
---
If you can't afford a subscription, wait until a PLEX offer with a good discount (other websites often have greater discounts than CCP) and buy as much as you can to plex your account for some time until a new offer arrives.
---
If you can't even do that, either grind more or play as an alpha... but as others have correctly pointed, you and players that just abuse the isk making capabilities of supers and rorqs are the reason PLEX is so fucking expensive.
---
So fuck off.
---
people are not subscribing because of chat or unsubscribing because of chat. If your logic is applied CCP went bankcrupt in last 12months because nobody would be subbed.
---
Wrong.
---
Tinfoil hat mode ON
---
I remember issue when Pacifier and Enforcer ships were given out to EVE Vegas (?) attendees. Initially they were given on a per account basis and then after a ranting they were removed and given again, this time once per-email basis.  
---
Looks like someone reused a wrong script to give out SP, the one that did its job once per email, not once per account.
---
Tinfoil hat mode OFF
---
Brilliant, resubbed my accounts on April 4th '18 and have been subbed since but no skillpoints of course. I am glad it wasn't March 21th though because those players  must feel really fuckd over by this arbitrary allocation. 
---
I don't think patch is going to do much to change it I'm afraid, the changes don't go far enough. But it's a first step and an indication that CCP is actually taking the problems seriously for the first time in 3 years, so that's good news. 
---
lol at the fact op thinks haw titans will go extinct.
---
why is it so hard for ppl to have a decent understanding of the game.
---
Yeah, a first step and CCP has shown that they actually listen to us! One step at a time!
---
I had quite a bit of fun with a solo abaddon a while back, I was intentionally flying off meta things, and its not great but I think as others have said it's not really supposed to be effective as a solo ship rather than filling its role as a brick tanked brawler.
---
Devs have been bouncing around wormhole space for years.
---
Why do you think the enyo got good? 
---
Hilmar, like the rest are probably nomadic moving between the corps, seeing how different people adapt to their changes and different aspects of the game. So they can get good input on balances from not reddit.
---
If I were them I would bounce around class wormhole corps too. You’ll be able to experience all aspects of the game without having to bot or use dev powers.
---
EVE has a pretty strange culture of "pirates" sitting in lowsec and basically pirating nothing, while looking down on the actual pirates who plunder the rich carebears highsec. I guess it's just an RP thing for you guys right? Do you also dress like a pirate while playing? If you wheren't so afraid of losing a ship to CONCORD you could actually participate in the elite highsec PvP instead of crying on reddit about it while waiting in a gatecamp with 20 friends to catch some noob ship or a shuttle every couple of hours. Think about it.
---
http://anoik.is/systems gives a breakdown of which systems are in each region/constellation. 
---
They have been used a few times in the past 2-3 years and more recently by init. Mostly because you can welp like 4 fleets of them for the costs of 1 mach or tfi fleet.
---
So then do it 3-4 times and average it.
---
Fair point, I guess I'm old school. Been doing plexes since before MTUs. Good suggestion though. :oldFart:
---
I just heard about it third hand, so I'm not sure either. My confusion is 'if they reimbursed it....why did they also duplicate it?'
---
Well no matter how much you edit your shitty comment, it is not going to make a difference. It is not about you paying for the subscription while you rot to death. It is about other players like me, there are quite a few players like me. And if you have a problem with me voicing my opinion please fuck off. And post wasn't made to gain anybody's sympathy, well how could one expect understanding from a square headed person like you! My bad, again the post ain't for you so shut the fuck up and fuck off.
---
TLDR: Shut the fuck up and fuck off! I did not post this for your sympathy or your opinion! Go back to the caves of ignorance you came out of!
---
Fair play. A meta fit caracal or moa should be able to reach those ranges without too much trouble.
---
I’m pretty sure they Aeon has been missing quite a few parts for years now too.
---
your Chinese is not bad. but as far as i know , origin is not doing 合纵连横. it's all about the game content so elo is looking for fun TBH.
---
This is unironically happening
---
Good shit
---
For some reason, they couldn't find anyone from HK who wanted to give their side
---
Krab to plex.. to krab even more 🤣 true!
---
I mean blops was in a fairly healthy state of the game before carriers with the uber meta for krabbing so the points kinda mute.
---
These are all shit reasons. If you want a capital that can nuke subcaps bring a dread and give an opportunity for some counter play.
---
[ccp are hiring](https://www.ccpgames.com/careers/portal/)
---
Inspiring picture, love it
---
The initial announcement for Shield slaves stated that they would give reduced shield recharge rate while you had that equipped to compensate for giving a ton of extra HP.
---
Don't bother complaining about these changes on r/eve because the mods simply don't care and will delete/censor points of view they don't agree with.
---
Yeah, there must be an issue somewhere because I didn't receive it on any of my four active accounts vOv I will file a support ticket 
---
Wet morning 😄
---
blopsing was in a healthy state before citadels got littered in every single system and cloaky t3c's could run ded's
---
Lmaoing @ ur life, this whole comment chain is autistic as fuck, not like id expect anything else from an eve subreddit LMAO 😂
---
I was really excited to see this only to find out it is going to be at 1:30pm on a wednesday.  
---
Thanks for wasting my time and energy.
---
Eh, just explained why HAW titans are used like that, not that it's good or bad (honestly, I don't really care much about this supercap use, it's boring either way).
---
Not really, I am not willing to mention the name of the mod cause you might have had a bad incident with him/her. But mods have been quite helpful and understanding when approached the right way. Like the rest of us, they are humans too which many fail to recognize and/or understand! 
---
Or you could read the actual words...
---
I never said anyone was or was not subscribing because of chat, I said we had the _option_ to subscribe or not subscribe _knowing_ the state of the game _including_ chat.
---
If I want to buy a car and see it has a minor cosmetic scratch on the paintwork, I'll probably still buy it, but if I found out about it after I'd already made the purchase I'd be pissed, because I didn't have the option to decide if it was ok or not. That is the point.
---
My experience with snuffed personally, when they dropped on us in low sec and friends in lowsec, we rarely saw more than 3 titans with any drop, (lots of capitals like 6 with the 3 titans, not supers, just caps, but my point remains)
---
Take your sympathy and shove it up your ass. Nobody is asking for anybody's sympathy here!
---
Oohh ty , I was wondering about that ! Tyty
---
\\good suggestion!
---
I only edited the tl;dr you moron.
---
And of course you put it up here for everyone's opinion, it is a public forum you idiot.
---
Here, take a complementary dick so you have something to shove up your ass while you grind an extra hour to pay to buy plex so you can keep krabbing: 8=======D
---
ITT: people complaining about free stuff
---
As a general rule of thumb. 
---
People who live in odd numbered holes are cool.
---
People who live in even numbered holes have mental retardation.*
---
In order from best to worst.
---
C5&gt;C6&gt;&gt;C3&gt;&gt;C2&gt;&gt;C1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;C4’s
---
Just gota have the right job.  For example my boss works 100 miles from me.  I can do what I want as long as my work gets done.  
---
Yeah will try to save up some money for subscription. But a year worth of subscription is what we could use for a whole month of supplies lol! You hear me? 
---
P.S. not trying to gain sympathy which many dicks have taken the liberty to assume. Just saying about how it is for me!
---
That's a fair point and I don't disagree. I could see if they want to award a tangible asset, like an ultra exclusive ship, but these are skill points. If you're a paying subscriber and met the qualifications, you should be awarded those skill points, same as everybody else.
---
Agreed there are many things that were a nerf to blops if this will give me more targets I'm fine one of the best times I've had was hunting KWG a year ago with a friend in blops. A lot of them haven't switched to carrier ratting for some reason(atleast at the time) which yielded tons of content.
---
I agree there are other issues that have effected the health of blops in the meta but the amount of viable targets being less and less is a issue one of the causes is one you stated.
---
Step 1: Realize I am used to people on r/eve doing and saying really dumb things;
---
Step 2: Realize I am the guy who just got downvoted in another thread be he told someone to report racism in local chat;
---
Step 3: Read the following words--"Yep, I just assumed you someone on r/eve saying something dumb again. Apologies."
---
Step 4: Accept my apology. 
---
These are great changes.
---
And honestly I don't see what this changes about titan ratting other than slightly slowing it down. It wasn't a Boson nerf, and the HAWs will still do more than 1k DPS which is way more than enough for null sec anoms. 
---
RIP stain
---
Wow what a retarded set of lows
---
I am putting my bots into actions.
---
I tried ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯   They wouldn't speak to me
---
r/eveporn/ ?
---
Just rum, or [run featuring a pirate](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/1476110366-20161010.png)?
---
r/evedreddit should be able to help
---
We just deployed our blops but decided to wait until the changes to do anything since they look promising. It's still fun depending on who your hunting we went hunting kids with guns like a year ago went a month without docking deployed there hunting them was pretty fun.
---
Made some pretty good isk but it's not as viable as it used to be and I want it to be great again the style of play being nomad hunting is pretty fun. I really hope this change pushs more people into viable targets for blops it might not completely but looks like a step in the right direction.
---
If you get paid for your work and not by the hour... you’re not getting paid to reddit unless you’re in marketing. You’re just justifying distractions.
---
So which is the lie, what you just said on reddit or the one you wrote on the website?  
---
Just for those of us who like to keep a track of them all.
---
are u sure u don't have time??  u obviously have no life
---
Haa. Not until they move to Southern California, USA 🇺🇸 
---
Either hurting the tank of shield caps, making them super easy to kill, or hurting the application to both armor/shield carriers. This further makes them easier to kill, if they sacrifice tank to increase application with lowslots...see point one.
---
lmao what
---
There are 2 good places for it currently. One is on the discord server featured recently on Eve Pulse - the other is sorting by the top posts of all time here:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/top/
---
Look for /u/Catlos, /u/Cymek and /u/KatherineSilens. Other artists exist, of course, but they have produced the most on reddit specifically over the last 2 or so years.
---
What are you expecting? Endless posts thanking CCP for finally addressing issues affecting the game for years? Yes it’s good and they got a great reaction to that blog post. 
---
But then they do weird stuff like issue 500k free SP to  people for the local issues but picked a random date and only omega accounts on that specific date. Let alone that it was an issue for many months. 
---
This is the CCP and Eve way. 2 steps forward and 1 step back. Sometimes 1 forward and 2 back. 
---
There are (or were - I guess CCP could have added more without telling anyone) 12 that dropped.
---
WHY?
---
I am a simple man. I see pcgamer, I downvote
---
/u/absolutetruth
---
I'll let you deal with this one.
---
So you think that 6 min panic and being able to tank 100k dps tank ( tank setups ) means you will roll over and die instantly?
---
Fuckin'
---
Get out
---
doo eet!
---
https://www.dictionary.com/e/moot-point-vs-mute-point/
---
 The way this is made leads me to believe these guys reside within a hivemind construct outside the pockets we have access to.Also there's been no confirmation yet that any flesh and blood triglavians were encountered by Concord on that initial captured cruiser.
---
Most holes have inhabitants, even if it's a near-inactive industrial group or a farm alt hole. You have to be prepared to remove something or spend a long time looking if you have a specific requirement (like "C3 (HS)").
---
Why didn't CC just run it through project discovery and have some rewards for showing up?
---
600k ehp komodos here we come
---
But they have a furry corp?
---
find npc mining skiffs. wreck them.
---
its amazing how fast gamers go for the pitchforks these days, not just here its all games, its 500k sp, big fucking deal!! probably all the same people that were getting bent out of shape about the alliance tournament that no one cared about
---
This will continue to get worse until CCP do something about the ISK printing of nullsec anomalies. At least they're looking at it now and have made some tiny tweaks, so we can hope that they might get harsher with the nerf bat (particularly to AFK ISK farming).
---
Typical Eve players thinking they are the only ones that exist or matter.
---
Yes it would definitely not a perfect solution but I think that is a better than the suggestion of let inhibitors cancel active cyno.
---
Lighting a cyno should be risky because you are stuck in place for 10 minutes but it also shouldn’t give you unlimited reinforcements for the duration without counter play. We need some mechanic to disrupt the cyno function while keeping the ship trapped for the duration.
---
God did they let Init finish in their mouth after they got done sucking them off? 
---
Normally I haat Stitch's ideas on Marauders and Battleships in general, however in this particular instance he's right, this DPS buff wont help the Abbadon (my first solo BS).  The current mobility levels in EVE aren't going to be fought off by this beast with a small damage increase, shes just a left over relic from an era where the ships just stood toe to toe and slugged it out.
---
dw rorq are nerf everything going to be fine again 
---
I hadn’t noticed it before either so I assume it’s brand new this week.
---
When VNI ratting, is an auto-targeting system actually helpful for keeping aggro off drones?
---
That’s what I thought. Couldn’t find any mention of it at all. Thanks. :)
---
If that were to scale, the tempest would be nearly as big as the chimera.
---
In big fleets the napoc is a much better alternative to the neddon due to the extra application, the geddons suffers from the lack of range unless you beam fit and gimp the fit but I remember flying neddons in lowsec they are prob one of the best comp for lowsec back vs back slugfest.  The needing is in a ok spot maybe a bit of range would make it very strong almost too strong.
---
Rorqs will still  be good but those of us who rorq mine with constant risk (read: low sec, not in powerbloc) get stuck with the brunt of the downside.  
---
Hope it helps the game as a whole b/c the changes blow for any smaller alliance.
---
It's not wrong you know
---
I avoided this for the longest time because I thought you had to be IN ORBIT to launch a new command center.
---
I love how this change will make navy armageddon even more irrelevant.
---
Run what through? An advert?
---
The test itself is not run by CCP, they just provide eve and valkyrie assets to the company who does.
---
They don't rely solely on EVE players, it's just that CCP asks their players, too.
---
Sure, PC gamer so desperately needs to please some space guild.
---
nice moves keep up the good work
---
You don't pay money for your sub\*  
---
You definitely pay for it.
---
anime was a mistake
---
I think ships van watp through them.
---
Us wormholer btw are just sharpening our spears.
---
He's a botter, you dumbass.
---
Do one, and quote all the account names of your alts. I did that in mine. Not sure if it'll work. 
---
top kek
---
Why are you agressive to Anark? He simply gave his opinion to a topic you wrote on a public forum. 
---
Nobody forces you to play a videogame if you can’t afford the subscription. You can play as an alpha toon and have a lot of fun doing so. Capital ships are expensive (ISK/RL money wise). If you are in financial distress, it’s a bit stupid to « play poker » with virtual assets that represent a lot of value IRL. Tldr: quit eve if you can’t afford it but don’t whine here - you will have zero sympathy. 
---
why is it so hard for ppl to have a decent understanding of shitposting  
---
EVE Online is serious business. 
---
This, but unironically
---
In B4 lowest omega sub date, meaning least amount of skill points needing to hand out, which in turn is easiest and most effective PR.
---
So I asked earlier (not you btw) but nobody answered.
---
Why not use a blockade runner?  Non-uniformity of multiboxing makes it a lot harder?  Useful for only one task?  Higher risk of getting caught?  Or something else?
---
Almost there! 10 to go lol
---
Can’t wait for this! First CCP event and first time to Amsterdam!
---
File a ticket. I've done the same for just-missed deadlines, dates, etc and have occasionally been successful. 
---
Check your math. It's not a 1:1 nerf
---
So which is it? Region or Constellation?
---
&gt; The Initiative’s pilots pulled off what most of EVE thought was impossible, and they did it without anyone even knowing. 
---
Maybe if most of eve is retarded.  Everybody else understood that evicting Rage was unlikely only due to the huge pain in the dick it would be to get all the pilots needed inside the hole.  Numbers still rule, WHs just make it more annoying to obtain that numerical supremacy. 
---
there's 2 types of rorqs. Umbrella rorqs and non umbrella rorqs. The tank change won't really make that much of a difference other than opening up a couple more fleet options to take them down, but you still have the time to cyno through panic and get a response. If you don't have a response fleet ready when panic ends, as long as the people going after you aren't tards youre going to die anyways.
---
The nerf that matters is the yield nerf, and that hurts the guy who mines with multiple rorqs more than the guy who mines with 1. These are good changes
---
Ya but they could of provided the link to download whatever this is through project discovery and pilots could of been rewarded for doing so

That's it! Wasn't coming up in the search. 
---
Like maybe WHs?
---
I'm no expert on character but I'm guessing if I went to aryth and said "abloo bloo free sp abloo bloo" he would call me a mouthbreathing twatbiscuit and tell me to fuck myself in the clavicle with a shit covered spoon

you won't be missed.

Let's just say Steven Messner probably would have gotten an interview.
---
what in jamyl's name is this abomination
---
Lost a fortizar due to not being able to form a fleet or do much of anything for that matter was told to fuck off by GM's and that the chat had nothing to do with it but hey......we get 500k sp because the chat issues "caused a lot of problems"

And ganking scrubs?

*nods*
---
Can’t make it but I approve 
---
Weird. It's like, you should, like, PvP in your capitals, and not be a fucking krab.
---
Weird
---
You really got some Snuff'd Napoleon Ego juice out of this one
---
Most Krabs will switch to sensor boosters, which while combined with the application nerf will reduce their ticks and tank, will still leave them 99% safe to non blue tackle.
---
HAW titan nerf is only really a nerf to dumb spodbrains who drop haw titans on frigates under the delve umbrella, they will still be very strong in fleet combat.
---
Almost no one is crying about this bar a few smoothbrain goons you could count on one hand. I wish there was an extinction event for your posting.
---
Something something, POS bug? I dunno that's why I'm asking.
---
It definitely hurts alphas ratting with navy drones, a full set is about 20 mil now, and if you’re orbiting at 30km they probably won’t get to you in time. 
---
Might be good news for anyone who invested in hawkmoth implants, though 
---
Region.
---
I do.
---
[Might make stupid shit like this happen less often.](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75636435/)
---
Ah, was thinking you just sold it with the riggs + hull.... nvm that's a pretty great price! haha
---
That was my thought too, no idea why they're not doing this between EU/US timezones on a weekend. 
---
No. just checked an account i have only used plex on and it has just 1 line in the account transaction history, from when i started the account.
---
I'm pretty sure it won't have been as the original item was still out there. They only reimburse stuff that explodes, don't they?
---
It's a good start.
---
I'm pretty sure you can't 'restrict' access to POCOs, they are accessible to everyone. What you can do is up the tax to a point where it doesn't make sense for anyone but your crew to use them.
---
    Normally I haat Stitch's ideas on Marauders 
---
     and Battleships in general
---
Grr Stitch, haat Stitch. 
---
Sorry, couldnt resist. Carry on, i have no resentment to someone who disagrees with me. 
---
It must be a glitch on your end CCP said they fixed the chats and they are working just fight. Try resetting your router and phone that will probably fix the problem for you.
---
I'm fairly new and missing a lot of background.
---
I know PLEX prices have drifted upward over EVE's lifetime (like OP, when I joined, it was 2.9m).  In patches since then, I don't remember any buffs to ratting.  Was there a big one some time ago, and the current upward trend is just normalizing?  Is the supply decreasing for whatever reason?  Is one market accelerating at the cost of others?  Or is it something else?
---
He just said the SP is for the downtime, not for the chat system issues throughout 2018. 
---
You could have just looked at the interviews they gave to other stuff. I think INN actually had a really good interview with someone from HK as well as someone from Init. 
---
Or you could have just realized that bringing 1300 people (it was about 300 Init and 1k goons when they first got control of Rage, right?) to fight 100 real people, half of whom aren’t even home, isn’t very impressive. 
---
Come back to us, accept us inside of yourself
---
I'm not playing Eve to give money to poor people in Asia. I already do that.
---
Pray harder brother
---
jesus fuck, this again?
---
Here's a counter to boosh fleets: massed titans. perfectly effective.
---
Which small groups use rorquals? Seriously?
---
Same vid is currently playing in stations/citadels so its in the game rn
---
To name but one goddamb counter. There are plenty others.
---
Seriously. For a moment there I had to check to make sure I hadn't stumbled onto some sort of resurrected Battleclinic fitting database.
---
Those are cap guns 
---
It’s after 12:00 somewhere in the world... right? Right?
---
We brought 60,000 to fight 3 real people, two of whom were orphans *actually*
---
Stop being bad.. Pos were/are cancer and need to die.. 
---
The one in a million are funny to read about but there is too many negatives vs pos to want to keep them around at any level beyond this. 
---
JESUS so much hate
---
No, they reimburse stolen items too. Usually that happens when someone 'hacks' an account though.
---
It's always after 12:00 in my heart!
---
yeah, with pretty much all amarr ships you have to use a cap booster. i think they're not too bad though, they're good brawlers and at least it means you don't care about neuts 
---
Then don't move your titan solo 4head. 
---
I swear to christ I could whack you over the head with a book until you didn't have one and we'd still have the same argument over and over.. Absolutely hopeless. 
---
sure men but it looks amazing
---
at least POS let you use dreads as siege ships.
---
vs citadels, no point at all unless the citadel is afk.
---
and i liked having a POS i could set up as a gun POS in wormholes.  it gave you a weapon to be proud of.
---
Green anoms in K-Space? Use an AFK dominix. Same ticks as a VNI, better insurance, and can light a cyno to save your butt.
---
In terms of isk your looking at maybe 1 - 1.2 bill on the high side.         
---
500 Plex for $20 is just under 2bill.    
---
 So ya it's not a bad deal
---
With three days left, really? try again.
---
Less drama plz
---
ten bucks for 780mil.
---
frankly, learning the value of money is an important part of staying interested in the game. learning how to make money in a way that is fun, or at least not terrible to you, is quite possibly the most valuable knowledge you can get because it scales when your dollars don't
---
I wouldn't buy it or recommend buying it until you know what you'd do with the money 
---
How much?
---
What the fuck is this abomination? 
---
Not after the new balance wave.
---
Bothers lives matter
---
Yeah i hear all the time of friends getting stuff reimbursed below 2bil even though nothing actually was going on.
---
it's bad value compared to just subscribing to the game.
---
that tristan skin is beign sold for a few million isk RN so if you want it you don't need to buy a starter pack.
---
So the story is, I didn't roll this, I bought it. But I'm extremely pleased with it, albeit kind of worried about Abyssal mods in general, given how powerful this is. This is a T2 Large and Medium cap battery combined (with 7% less neut resistance than two T2 batteries) but for the fitting cost of a Thukker large. That said, it's a big risk to actually use it for anything it would be valuable for, and an extremely rare roll, but similar rolls without what I see as "unnecessary" improvements (the CPU, in this case) are more common.
---
That all said, I'm happy to have it, and I don't want to be taking a side on abyssal mods in general. I just thought some people here might think it was neat.
---
Amarr’s navy bs line need to be buffed, but I’m ok with abaddon’s current state.
---
Of course It’s shit in small scale, but every ship don’t have to be relevant in small scale.
---
After buff, abaddon will be best F1 armor T1 bs doctrine, with clear weakness (cap life).
---
Maybe guardians can give cap logi to them, or indy ship can haul cap booster......I think there will be a lot of answer about this problem.
---
tl;dr : Abaddon don’t need to be buffed more, It will be good F1 lowsec doctrine.
---
Thanks for the advice. I'll hold off for now.
---
yeah, so what's going to happen with my supply of cheap high-grade talismans??
---
Not at 500m when your cloak gets turned off at 2000m!
---
Speaking of navy harb - same capacitor problem, even worse since it is usually supposed to move around more and use prop mod more. I took a beam navy harb on a roaming once, we caught a carrier and i ate through almost all of my cap booster charges in like 5 minutes. That really sucks
---
They blow things up and then warp away.
---
&gt; it was supposed to be a bit of a limp fish without a support fleet
---
kinda sucks with a support fleet tho. Can't think of an engagement at any size from small gang up that I was thinking "man I wish we had formed abaddons" 
---
I wasn't posting it to sell it, just to show off and, maybe, to have a conversation about abyssal mods (I don't know, mostly it's vanity). Unless you mean how much I paid for it.
---
I dont think i mentioned amarr not utilizing cap boosters. Just stating that when you have a 4 mid amarr laser battleship, you realistically have a 3 mid battleship, as 1 mid is dedicated to a booster. Which severely limits things you can do with the ships.
---
Also, ive flown a heavy beam navy harb and never ran into major cap issues unless i was permarunning the MWD.
---
The only way  to stop this is to kill it, I can assure you that
---
titan pilots just need time to adapt
---
\-wh'er btw
---
Nerfs will always hurt smaller groups more; they don't have as much capacity to adapt. Bemoaning it doesn't change that these changes needed to happen. 
---
I'm surprised it's only been 10 mil.  Get into a null sec roam and biff it hard so the whole fleet donates 5 mil for the noob
---
20mil
---
This needs to be put on a supertanking T3 to troll the shit out of ppl.
---
It's not about the fucking SP. It's about CCP making a mistake, saying they would reimburse for their fuck up and then shafting a good deal of people because they choose to reward for people subbed on day one instead of people that suffered through for the last year.
---
Can you give me a good picture of havana like that and I'll see what I can photoshop up
---
Other than the rarity of the rolls there are few needs for this outside the now non existant AT. 
---
Pretty much the same as any other capital or super. I jump it around a lot and sometimes I get to shoot things with it.
---
literal thousands including dozens of supers and rorquals at a minimum
---
You can restrict access by standings in wh space not sure if you can or cant in other space though
---
Nope it the yield changes will
---
if you got a titan(and your not in goons).  99% of the time its a jump bridge.
---
0.5% of the time, your a risky fker who is bosoning rats for fun.
---
and 0.5% of the time, your finally, finally, fighting....and the fight is over before you have you fill.  and your left glaring at the rest of the fleet, specifically the one subcap who isn't following the fc, but instead bumping into you,  and wondering if you can get away bosoning them, before the FC notices.
---
in short, its not as glorious as you imagine. and yet it is at the same time.
---
Been unsubbed for last month on all accounts, see 500k to each subbed acc for march, curse myself, see 2018 date - 500k sp on each account confirmed TY CCP &lt;3
---
Dt never dies, and they don’t fade away 
---
For sure.  It's not a content killer but one of Bomber Bar's selling points was hunting down "whales," like ratting carriers and rorqs, that the giant bomber blob excels at killing.  Battleships and such are still viable targets but not for the size of fleets BB tends to bring to the field.
---
Were abyssal modules even allowed in AT? I haven't been around for a while.
---
Proud of my alliance mates, dt is the fucking best 
---
Just uploaded a short clip to show how it looks, but it plays the full thing. You can see it in station without sound or by zooming in on the billboard at any highsec gate.
---
Thanks for the shoutout! 
---
I definitely am one of them, this is very cool indeed! xD
---
Question: You mentioned you bought it, how much isk you paid for something so unique?
---
It's definitely not constellation, it's either region or entire class. Region is the best guess based on C5 respawn rates. 
---
That ship, on the other hand, is not. 
---
/s
---
Because I can.
---
It is 100% not constellation, tested in C6. 
---
Beautiful. 
---
What are some good non-pro mining vessels?
---
Yes they were allowed on the flagship. Only other possible demand I can see is the abyssal pvp runners but there are only a few.
---
I find that hard to believe. Don't you ever find yourself lonely on a Sunday night? 
---
It make titan only good for pvp, thing is, pvp for titan almost never happen in 2019 so well
---
Thanks!
---
That's what junior Corp members are for
---
It bums me out so little space uses some of the really cool effects they use in certain DED sites and missions, suns look gorgeous too.
---
You will make that back 2 sets in one haven anyway
---
you know that you can pay real money to get omega, right?
---
On the other side, you can also see it as a kind of reward for the ones that venture into these places. And as an incentive for others to try it out.
---
20.01mil
---
Yes, but if you’re getting 10 mil ticks losing even one drone hurts quite a bit.  If the hunter sticks around and you lose the whole set that’s even worse 
---
it was a few days, spread over a year.
---
stop being so fucking over dramatic
---
RIP Vexor and Gila. 
---
Love the changes.
---
Invasion Inc
---
Either way too much or a ridiculous steal, depending on your perspective: 2bil. But I really wanted it, and it was a great deal for *me*, so all is good.
---
Unfortunately, they don't age like fine wine.  
---
Are they taking them from Blood Raiders? I've not heard that they're being removed from BR and they drop quite often from exploration. 
---
Triglavian way - Mind over Matter, Spirit over Mind
---
Others (or better say "niekompetentna developerska kurwa powszechnie znana jako CCP") way - Mind over Spirit, Matter over Mind
---
It says "I know the Mittani"
---
Not all of us are opposed to earning freedom currency
---
getting close
---
&gt;What do we compare it to? In my opinion I think dull PVE and a shitshow NPE have huge ramifications on player retention. What about CCP's preference to sit on their hands for months... years... before balancing and revamping stuff? So yes, surely Wardecs must obviously be the prime offender here. I don't deny our hand in it, but to act as if everyone else is innocent... pft!
---
They absolutely do have player retention ramifications.  I agree CCP takes a long time to make changes and are usually so drastic they change the entire meta. I don't get why they don't try incremental changes instead of "this ship now has half the survivability with reps" instead of trying to slowly move the needle.
---
&gt;I don't deny that Nullsec is shit and the content is stale. The point I was making is that Wardecs are in their current form because of the people whining to CCP for them to change it, while they can't think 3 steps ahead on how this will effect the meta. I realize that trying to develop and balance a sandbox game in which players have tons of influence on how it's played is complicated, but come on...
---
This is the Crux of the issue. Eve was developed to be harsh and cruel and that's how it gained its base.  They can think 10 steps ahead and still make a bad choice because since there is little regard for anyone in the game no one cares how it will affect the game as a whole as long as they get their short term Plex. Yes CCP is at fault since it's their game and they alone control it.
---
&gt;Should we be required to be somewhere specific?
---
Variety is the spice of life. But no, I didn't say that. I was making a point where you're making it out to be more than jita camps. 
---
&gt;Funny how it's people that have "quit" or "given up on eve" that are the vocal ones. I hate that you aren't playing, but really... what's it to you? Unless you're going to join the ranks that are allegedly going to make it impossible for us, then what are we doing here? We'll just have to see how it goes upon release :)
---
I spent 6 almost 7 years playing Eve, it was a huge part of my life for a long time. I still want the oppourtunity to come back to it eventually. Seeing war deccers having the slightest bit of skin in the game now makes me happy because it's one less bad mechanic to consider when I do come back. Running logistics is a nightmare of boring garbage without gankers and greifers but with them it just made me numb to the game. I'm also not saying it's going to be impossible for you, I'm saying there will be something you actually have to defend instead of docking up because someone brought guns. But if you interpret that as impossible maybe there was more validity to what I said than you thought.
---
He was only off twitch for a day
---
Rorqs will just switch to using 3 excavators and 2 t2 or faction mining drones so less excavotors to kill  or steal and will see fewer rorq kills worth 5bil+ after the patch. also with the tank reduction faction fits wont increase survivability enough to be worth using so it will go to t2 cheap fits.
---
The rorq mining nerf is unsurprising. CCP just realised how many subscriptions were kept running by the old mining barge fleets.
---
Make safe nearby shoot warp off come back align to safe repeat
---
Npc?
---
Npc or player?
---
The ones that are out will also be easier to catch or less defensible, defending on how they choose to fit their ships. Gotta factor that in as well.
---
Trust me eve didn't have so many mining accounts like it have today
---
Put it in a shuttle and hide it in a system. See how long it takes for someone to find it.
---
&gt; attacked. So you might lose some isk by pulling drones more often/getting safe if something comes by that can kill you before theta gets to you.
---
Sorry but unless your frt ticker is ironic you don't get to complain about how this affects the little guy. Its amazing how many big null groups complain for the mysterious "little guy" 
---
The little guy is not rorqual mining and if they are they are doing it in a wh or in well controlled low sec space. NEARLY everyone in null rorqual mining is either part of a rental agreement with a large group or in a large group. 
---
Is this propaganda for the new russian coalition?
---
Well, it's a unique thing... If you were ok paying 2B isk on it, there isn't any steal at all! LoL
---
This guy gets it. Eve isn't about big dick toys, eve is about satisfying "I was there" moments and with this risk-aversion blob meta those don't happen.
---
This guy sums it up nicely
---
Indoor-swimming, I hope... Cause lookin outa my window I d say visiting a "Freibad" d be calling for lightings and a new haircut ;)
---
Thanks ccp i got it on all my account :)
---
thing is very simple: CCP has NOT admited any issue with chat on ANY of their official purchasing sites. So whenever you was subscribing, you werent warned about chat issues.
---
Right? ... so, that's about that.
---
We have to cut it off at some point though. Timing is a bitch if you're on the bad end of it, but if it's not you it's someone else.
---
Even Falcon looks slightly drunk. Have you been pouring it into the keyboard?
---
No, it is all residents in Fountain, and has been that way for ages, long before you guys moved there.
---
*Ok, this is epic.* It's your **3rd Cakeday** MajorJenkins! ^(hug)

Nah, its been more the kind of "Oh, neut in local, better GTFO"
---
PURGE ALL THE HEATHEN MODS.
---
'Yurt' mobike depots give the same feeling for me
---
shit doesn't taste like it used to taste
---
...Wait so nonrorqers might actually get fucked by this?  
---
Well, rip.
---
&gt; They absolutely do have player retention ramifications. I agree CCP takes a long time to make changes and are usually so drastic they change the entire meta. I don't get why they don't try incremental changes instead of "this ship now has half the survivability with reps" instead of trying to slowly move the needle.
---
I fully agree here. It's really frustrating. I just wish that now that the CSM has made an example out of wardecs that they would be concerned with other areas of player retention. Who knows, we may find that PI has eliminated more players than anything else!
---
&gt; Variety is the spice of life. But no, I didn't say that. I was making a point where you're making it out to be more than jita camps.
---
I agree, but I don't think that all we do is Jita camps. A lot of the other stuff we do doesn't showup on the killboard. Something that literally happened just now resulted in about 15 people making 1.5b a piece, and had nothing to do with camping a trade hub. Yes, I know isolated examples. I highly disagree :)
---
&gt; But if you interpret that as impossible maybe there was more validity to what I said than you thought.
---
I didn't mean to put words in your mouth. I guess I'm conditioned to the fact that most of the people here believe that they will somehow make it impossible for us.
---
found this downvote button here in reddit for $0.

Yes, it is indoor. But it also has a large outside area which is heated.

I was there as a child once and it snowed outside while we were in the hot water in the evening. There are underwater lights installed in the pool, so it was realy amazing to see the snowflakes fall into the mist and still be warm and cozy in the water.

Am I the only one that fell in love with the idea of a force field in space that I could create?  It was one of the first things I thought was really cool in EVE.  
---
Forget about constellation, even if you find the way to figure out which one is best, you would spend sooo much time looking for the right hole in THAT specific constellation and guess what... By the time you find it you might find it is already packed by someone who didn't care about constellation, but was very lucky to get into that system MONTHS before you...
---
The most important things for finding your very home-sweet-home hole are following (from most to least important):
---
* Class
---
* Static(s)
---
* Wormhole effect
---
* Planets
---
* Ok, size can fit here...
---
Everything else is very irrelevant. You should realize that once you settle in J-space you would be scanning sooooo much, that you'd better start getting prepared right now by looking for that particular hole by yourself, rather than buying it from someone else!
---
Good luck, and remember - J-Space is the best space! 
---

---
Little while ago I stole a nyx from some ruskies on malpais bu guessing their pos password. Turns out 1234 is not secure :) wish I waited though, there was a erebus and a rag there too which logged off as soon as I got spotted. 
---
Depends on what you consider "pro." Orca's are heavily used in high sec, and Porpoise seems to be the equivalent if you're in more dangerous space. A step under that would be exhumers, and below that; barges. In both categories people seem to tend towards the tank variant (skiff and procurer, respectively) for increased safety, unless you have reason to believe you are mining in extreme safety. 
---
What about non-omega?
---
I mean, you can probably get more for it from an AT team ship if someone decides to have a cap battery fit of some kind. Getting a roll like that spending 2 bil on the mutas and components is very unlikely.
---
muhahaaaa
---
Yeah, but that would buff freighters too much.
---
Hulls tanked mega navy with hull slaves hnnnnnnnnnngggggggggg
---
Hull tanked Mega navy / vindis hnnnnnnnngggggg
---
you can already do slaves + resistance platings
---
Na, if you had stumbled on a battleclinic database it would have a shield booster and everything else would be cap mods. Still pretty close though.
---
til facts are dramatic
---
To add on to what /u/tinselsnips said, the mobile depo has a reinforce timer which means it cannot be destroyed and looted right away. It has to be shot and then the attacks have to come back later, much like a structure.
---
good fukn luck neuting this wearer out, esp if there are 2 batteries installed!
---
wat? I use abyssal'd T2 tackle mods all the time. Unstable mutaplasmids and T2 mods are cheap as fuck and you get faction quality without faction price. The only downside is that you don't get faction fitting.
---
I hope this leads to some new larger PvE content, kinda like those drifter WHs, possibly related to actual Trig worlds/stations instead of this little Trig highway we currently messing around in now 
---
how much did you pay for it 
---
So you would have 3 Eve players show up instead of a few thousand?
---
If 100 euro is much how can you afford a pc then.... 
---
why do you people post like this
---
since you can't debate or discuss the facts you just pretend the fact stated was wrong with some half ass comment. init/goons literally do this all the time
---
did i miss a psyops class or something
---
you have to zoom in a billboard to hear it?  That's cool.  Are they the end-game of Eve?  The Triglavians will be the cataclysm for New Eden War IV!
---
You sure told him with your well thought out and factual argument.
---
plated arks are already op with 1.2m ehp
---
The ironic part is this will bring new players to the game. Congrats Init!!
---
This game challenges people who try to play for free. Deal with it.
---
The same thing happened with me in 2013, but my CEO was a shitlord and took the credit for it. 
---
Perun Veles Svara   It's saying there is a great war coming between 2 god's more than likely Triglavian Vs Drifter's.
---
My question does not mention EvE players at all. 
---
stfu globby stop pretending
---
DELETE IT
---
You clearly did not understand that my response was as to the module posted. Tell me outside of a curse/pilgriam and a couple battleships who would want a buffed large cap battery for more than a couple hundred mil?
---
I’ve made close to 3 bill exploring last 2 days, no rng blessings, just relic sites... I’ve been playing for about a month and a half, pretty sure if I can do it then anybody else can..

It’s only difficult to make iskies the lazy way, but that’s a good thing.

Me too, Triglavians are not as interesting
---
Because Gallente are people too!
---
The only way to fly!

Entertaining for the content starved denizens of genesis.
---
broadcast with what?
---
Just fly a bhaagorn current best laser bs platform and there is.
---
They drop 3 titans because that's how many they need to hit damage caps and to bait an escalation, they have dozens of FAX and the rest of the superfleet ready to drop if any serious challenge presents itself. It's basically the same as xXxHighsecWarlordPussySlayerxXx in his 3b HG slaved Proteus with neutral astarte boosts. There are multiple guardians ready to save it from any serious threat. 
---
Toni don’t forget to buy the tacos

Because the exaggerations I see posted - apparently seriously - get more outlandish every time, and the "Dotlan numbers vs assumed 'real players' comparison gets more dishonest. Why not satirise the silliness with a little hyperbole?
---
I certainly could debate and discuss the facts, but since people like you lap up the bullshit posted by people who weren't even there because you'd swallow almost anything if it was something bad about us, I wouldn't expect to gain much by making the effort.
---
GJ Larf &amp; co! Nothing quite beats the time DJ stole that Aeon in provi during a 3rd party!

Tacos are a terrible filling delivery method. Convince me otherwise.

Change the bhaagorn hull to an abbadon hull= win

I mean I could show you a better filling method but I’m busy using it on your mother wooky❤️

Alright I’ll try it out.

Doesn't it kinda make sense for ships that are 10s of kilometers long to be best at shooting other very large things?

So in mainfleet fights, the abaddon is too slow to be relevant with MPL, which is why even months ago, people were rolling around with 1400 arty abaddons. Any mainfleet rolling MPL will just get kited, pinned, and bombed to death.
---
Cool post though.
---
Best part is that it's not even fixed, chat was turbofucked yesterday, and most days it still has inconsistencies.
---
He isn’t interested in logic outside of people who want to use MPL’s.
---
What  if I have constipation?
---
so let's make them useful for only 1 purpose that happen only twice a year at best ?
---
Well like, his entire post is wrong.  The abaddon was strong before the buff in certain situations, it's just not meta right now because those situations rarely exist.  None of his suggestions would fix that either 
---
I stopped keeping track when my Excel sheet hit the hard cap set by Microsoft.
---
not really cos theres alot of issues like citadels that they havent touched for years and this capital nerf has taken far too long and doesnt really hit the nail on the head as much as youd want it after waiting so long. 
---
It also makes sense for them to be good at shooting very small things as well. I would embrace thos change only if I didn't have to choose haws or cap guns. If both could be fitted and use the set you needed the , that would make this change fitting
---

---
Quality shitpost
---
&gt;people like you
---
hmmm
---
I mean, they were still affected.  If CCP doesn't want to give out all those SP, maybe they shouldn't release a shit system and ignore it \_FOR A YEAR\_
---
pimped cruiser, but those are rare those days.
---
Time to gas them
---
uhg simply delusional 
---
It's not exactly CCP's fault that it only happens twice a year.
---
Yes.
---
i'm uninvolved in the whole situation, but i see slimy posts from you and other people with autistic INIT tags in their reddit usernames unable to actually debate the facts and just go "LOL UR CRAZY" indirectly

Give it a try, it's the only way you'll know for sure. It's a time sink, if that's what you are after. 
---
Stick together and join an active corp to start learning the game. I've just come back after a long break at the start of the year and it's better than ever...so many different routes to take. 
---
Your last sentence nails it.
---
Is that a problem? sucide gankers need more numbers then 😊
---
can you please post a pic of a correct edit to 'cool guys don't look at explosion?' thanks :)
---
hype, see you there my dood
---
Changes are perfect. Titan users are a minority, and afk ratters deserve to die anyway.
---
It's literally free.
---
You and the captain can make it happen!
---
Oh wait...
---
I mean it's F2P, you've got nothing to lose.  It's still an active game.
---
More and more people getting into rorqs, so they a) need more plex for multiboxing and b) can earn more. The same idea is true for SP farm alts. 
---
Really the meta's just stagnated long enough that people are getting comfortable investing obscene sums into alts, since, hell, it's been the same for over a year now, I can pay for this alt eventually before the nerf, so why not get a 9th rorq?
---
you're making out like the game has been totally unplayable for the last 12 months, which is just nonsense.
---
it's free
---
go and form your own opinion.
---
i've never once said nor implied that
---
like i said, you're delusional
---
Take a break for a while. Worked for me. Came back in January and enjoyed every second.. I'd ignored pvp since like 2011 and I've joined goons and had pvp fun every time I log in.
---
Maybe try something you haven't spent any time on before and meet some new friends
---
Reddit was a bad choice to ask this question as I have noticed, there’s a lot of salty and sour vets around here that could put you off the game pretty quickly, “Eve is dying, no content, everything is nerfed”
---
I’ll tell you my opinion as a newbie (Been playing for a month and a half). I wish I had started playing this game way before, I had tried it back in early 2010ish but I couldn’t get into it because it was too complex and I didn’t really give it a chance, but don’t let that scare you off, it’s definitely worth it.
---
Eve is the most unique, complex and exciting game I’ve ever played. Literally everything you do is an adventure, you’re never safe. Every day is a new day, something different happens, the community is AMAZING (except reddit and corp/alliance politics), everyone is so helpful and newb friendly. In the beginning even if you get blown up as a newbie most people send you a little bit of cash to pay back for your loss.
---
The game can easily overwhelm you, but every new thing you learn, figure out or achieve feels extremely rewarding. 
---
Imagine doing “exploration” and you have a few hundred mill in cargo, you somehow end up in enemy territory and you need to get back home, somebody spots you and now you’re being hunted, you somehow made it out alive, you called your friends and they ambushed the hunters, you made some quick cash and went on an adventure. If the adrenaline rush and the gameplay itself doesn’t feel rewarding I don’t know what does..
---
Sorry for the long post, I just love this game so much. It has made me feel like a kid again, it’s like I’m having my “first mmo experience” haven’t had this much fun in over 10 years.
---
TLDR: Totally worth it.
---
Isn’t pretty much every game a time sink? But it comes down to how you play and if you’re enjoying whatever you’re doing..
---
i'm not the one pretending this is some massive issue that for a couple of days you couldn't see local.
---
there has literally been 1 day in the last year this has caused an issue more than "i'm too scared to rat". and that was when fleet chat stopped working.
---
You're right, it sucks ass. Make sure to bug report it to CCP.
---
i wouldnt but im sure some autist somewhere would for a krab machine. maybe a 100mn vagabond but those are meh so vOv
---
Eh free server use seems like good compensation to me
---
It's PP nowadays.
---
ive heard someone say "so FRT has a fursona now" 
---
I eat my fucking keyboard if CCP actually gets more than 1000 to show up for this ... Thing
---
Resub my main each January with year long sub. Nothing.
---
I’m sorry, a little confused... What’s wrong with what?
---
Shit whiskey, Shit photo, Shit peripherals.
---
#SHIT. POST.
---
&gt;i'm not the one pretending this is some massive issue that for a couple of days you couldn't see local.
---
can you actually just look at the words i post and not make these massive assumptions? jesus christ i threw delusional up as an insult originally but you're actually fucking insane
---
&gt;there has literally been 1 day in the last year this has caused an issue more than "i'm too scared to rat". and that was when fleet chat stopped working.
---
this is 100% false, there have been several days where local was down globally for hours at a time, literally just search "local broken" or something like that on reddit
---
regionally or locally local chat has been broken nearly consistently for months at least somewhere in new eden. Like i said, jita was broken for MONTHS straight.
---
Lol at anyone that thinks we have dozens of fax. We have more titans than fax
---
sergal jerk folded, it aint no more 
---
so like i just said - there was one occasion where something was an issue beyond 'i'm too scared to go and rat'
---
your idea - it's shit.
---
Seems to me you could just keep dragging it into space while moving very slowly away from your first and it would drop it pretty easily, idk I guess we'll see.
---
Not surprised hahaha. “Hates new things”
---
your idea isn't new, though. that's why it's even worse - you've taken a shit idea that has been floated many times and pretended you had an original thought.
---
&gt;so like i just said - there was one occasion where something was an issue beyond 'i'm too scared to go and rat'
---
i mean if you think dozens of rorquals dying in a day along with 8 super carriers an issue less than being afraid to rat
---
You say this like we haven’t been doing this in venal for years
---
is there a transcript of the video somewhere?
---
Like I stated before, I have been around for a month. As far as I’m aware I didn’t look up “Eve online ideas” just to come on reddit and post it as my own. 
---
Now if I knew this idea “had been floated many times” I honestly wouldn’t have bothered to post. I don’t know why you automatically had to jump to assumptions.
---
not as delusional to think a few days of a wonky local chat is actually a big deal.
---
One of the better propaganda posters.
---
Oof. Are we the fastest news agency in New Eden?
---
The Triglavian Collective takes over the holo-billboards all over new Eden. An ominous ultimatum is posed to the enemies and equally stern question is asked to humanity - which side you are on? Are you fit to be useful?
---
Your news for this week:
---
* Aria Jenneth of SFRIM first to report sighting of Triglavian Collective message 
---
* Playing on loop on all holographic billboards, including CONCORD gate advisory boards
---
* Possible new class of Collective cruiser identified with dual entropic disintegrators
---
* Transcripts posted to Galnet
---
* Rogue drones advised to ‘conform or be extirpated’
---
* Significance of ‘Convocation of Triglav Outside the Struggle’ increases, analysts believe this confirms hidden Collective colonies
---
* Possibility of diplomacy, alliance with Collective against Sansha, Drifters
---
If you find yourself far away from any Concord Billboards (wormholes?) here you go https://streamable.com/zupj1
---
Yeah they have an isk limit they never mention.
---
i didn't jump to any conclusion.
---
your idea is shit - so i told you it was. i wasn't jumping anywhere, i was just pointing out the obvious.
---
You REALLY expect them to actually do the work to make all of these changes?  This is CCRee, we're still 5 years of Tiericide not being finished.  Even getting the shield slaves themselves will be a big surprise if it actually happens.
---

It's not *just* CCP asking eve players.
---
Because lasers overall have more consistent damage/range/tracking compared to the gunnery systems, along with instareload+ammo change?
---
ACs: Good tracking, capless, good damage but pretty meh range (and more random due to large optimal+falloff difference)
---
Artillery: Shit tracking, good damage especially alpha, good range. Long af reload.
---
Blasters: Best tracking, best damage, shittiest range and does consume a good deal of cap. Short but significant reload. EM/Kinetic locked.
---
Rails: Good damage, good range, shitty tracking from medium and up, same as blasters in regards to cap and reload. EM/Kinetic locked.
---
Lasers: Good/great damage, okay/good tracking, good/great range. EM/Therm locked. Uses the most cap.
---
If you remove cap use from lasers, they will just be the best platform by default outside of niche roles.
---
If you can find her ashes scattered on the atlantic coast of Ireland, knock yourself out.
---
Nice I’ve been meaning to take a vacation
---
2 accounts got the sp, one of them wasn't subbed back then, one account that was subbed didn't get the sp
---
You said I’ve taken an idea that had been floating around, which I didn’t take from anyone. Just because I had an idea that’s the same as someone else doesn’t mean anything. 
---
Also I respect your opinion that my idea is shit and I didn’t challenge it either, but it seems you really do have a problem with new things lol.
---
If I were you (with my knowledge of a 3 year old player), I would not buy it yet. 1 bill is nothing once you get the ride. Also you won't be really able to do more fun stuff with more isk, just whelp more expensive stuff.
---
The most important thing is: Do what you like, and if you earn some isk with it, that is perfect. If you don't like it anymore, try something new. There are as many professions in this game as in real life, and like in real life, you gotta find the stuff that suits you yourself. And if you are out of SP for what you want, just make a new alpha with perfect 5mio skills into what you want.
---
At some point you might want to go further into the SP, you can do that either by daily injectors, or just buy monthly subscriptions (in € if you can afford it) or in ingame isk. At that point you will have enough income to buy yourself a month of training every few months (or even every month)
---
&gt; not as delusional to think a few days of a wonky local chat is actually a big deal.
---
I never said it was a big deal, I'm saying you're trying to downplay it based off of incorrect facts.
---
&gt;and a few spaceships dying, in eve, really isn't a big deal.
---
but being afraid to rat is?
---
yikes, keep strawmanning delusional boy
---
For simple balance reasons, they will most certainly nerf shield capitals.  Armor VS Shield is currently pretty balanced, adding 30%+ EHP to shield without nerfing the base would make armor totally useless.
---
I love all the Trig shit. If they don't fuck up the event itself like they did with permafrost and guardian gala I will resubscribe my PvE account for it for a couple months, maybe take the 3 or 6 month sub.
---
because it's a live show case for a professional trade show. And since those are usual on weekdays, the test has to run on a weekday too. as simple as that
---
\&gt;  It was 2.9m per PLEX when I joined the game and now it has gone to 3.9m per PLEX 
---
Which means you really have no idea what you're talking about, young bun.
---
well, out of 6 accounts subbed on 20th of March i got 2 with 500k sp on the highest skillpoint character on the account, 2 with 250k sp on the highest skillpoint character on the account and 2 with 250k sp on the lowest skillpoint character on the account
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It's not perfect no, but it's a good start.
---
I agree that things will be slower now, since recalling drones is much more often, and a hassle/dps loss to boot. I'm just saying things won't be extremely different. I know others have had issues with drones being targeted, I guess I just have been lucky. Also, I use Augmented Vespas simply because I get the most dps out of them. Have yet to lose a single one and I have ran 100+ t4, and at least 50 t5.
---
Blya xD
---
who says we cannot multibox in eve: aether wars?
---
Also it's not just eve players, but many more
---
fuck yea this is nice, this trailer plus the surprisingly good patch made me have some hope for EVE's Long term life 
---
Wait, since when were the sansha part of this story line. Is this new?
---
Ho Leeee Foook !!! I want it !!!!
---
I disagree that the PANIC nerf will hurt smaller groups, if a rorq gets tackled in a small group its fate is decided instantly (due to how many people were online, its fit and whats tackling it). A few extra minutes of forming for 2 or 3 extra ppl to log on wont save much.
---
I live in a small group that frequently uses rorqs and have to save them.
---
Nope. No fitting at all.
---
Since Feb 2009 at least.
---
You've yet to present anything new for me to dislike.
---
Sort of and yet not? The corrupted foreign narodnya have been mentioned before, but this is the first confirmation of Sansha possibly in Abyssal space.
---
That said, the Sansha \_are\_ most certainly in WH space, having colonized a set of systems in the shattered WHs, and possibly also fought the Drifters before we knew they were a thing. :x
---
Um excuse me.....Slippery petes, Jackdaws, Munins were/are not risk averse they are elite pvp ships that dont die because only the elitest of elite pvpers fly them. 
---
You know how they say you should never meet your heroes? Getting a Titan is kinda like that. Tons of people stop playing after they grind a Titan and realize the huge disappointment. Or it was their last "I'll learn to pvp once I have/do...." and they're still too scared to pvp but have run out of excuses not to. 
---

THANKS
---
Billboards in eve have sound?
---
I honestly didn’t post this specifically for you, but like I said, I welcome your opinion. Not everybody likes vanilla ice cream either and let’s leave it at that.
---
That's fine, I don't have one. Just doesn't seem right for a single pilot to be able to kill a citadel without any consequence.
---
i haat many things these days, comes with age
---
oh boy i cant wait to read what progodlegend, killah bee, gobbins, noraus, and i dono who FCs for GOTG chime in too.
---
Maybe it's time to pick my suit back up again and leave retirement.
---
It's so sad to read the awful amount of people complaining they didn't get free shit because they were not subscribed. 
---
My expereince has been that when rorquals are tackled by 50-100 man gangs in the smaller blocs there is often direct correlation between skill, time and survival, but im more than willing be wrong on this point. 
---
The answer to this question is always, YES. The game changes with patches and nerfs and buffs. The whiners will always whine and try to create chaos and chase people away from Eve. Do not let that deter you, try the game for yourself. It's a sandbox, yours to discover and play the way YOU want. Good luck.
---
The changes to panic aren't that big of a deal as odds are you weren't going to get rescued if they nobody showed up by the 4th minute, so it's really a quality of life change for groups who don't have to wait as long for panic to run out when either destroying the Rorqual or saving it and waiting for it to get off the grid, unless the Rorqual lit a cyno. As for the ice drone changes, some of us over comms last night concluded Helium tope prices will stay the same, while the rest will probably go up.
---
Out of curiosity, what type of chat problems were there? I haven’t been around for long, but my first encounter was yesterday and there was a huge delay between local chat within the systems.. Also a few occasions where my client would freeze when switching to rookie chat, Is there anything other than that? 
---
CCP should announce giving out 500k SP. Then when peole complain respond "not 500k to different people, we meant 500k TOTAL" lol.
---
Look at mister money bags over here. 
---
I'll admit it's terrible but it's what the opening post wanted.
---
It was like that for multiple days in a row intermittently for a span of 9.5 months.
---
It's certainly seeming like we're in for some interesting times... :D
---
I guess they'll unveil the content at Evesterdam.
---
I even was arguing with some retard who literally had no idea the scale of the chat outages, Jita local was literally fucked for i'd say a third of the time until the recognition of the issues with the January "Fix it or revert it" announcement.
---
Many systems' local chat would just spontaneously break for hours at a time, or show people in it that weren't there, or wormhole systems would show the people in it.
---
CCP is totally ignoring the fact that the issues were persistent for over a year (and local also just broke again a couple of days ago, resulting in people catching and killing many ratters and rorquals). These issues have real effects on the game, and lots of fanboys and CCP don't want to see it.
---
I’d expect people to put this on abyssal pve fits much more often than pvp fits. Getting neuted out is a huge problem there, and if you are careful you don’t actually risk losing your ship much. Pvp is always Rock Paper Scissors no matter how blingy you are
---
CCP wouldn't want to run out of skillpoints. 
---
It's all accurate apart from the afk part... I assume when you say cannot warp you mean with the NSA? But wjo the fuck afk carrier or super rats? 
---
It would work on an active T3C fit, wouldn't it?
---
Wormhole systems would have visible local. Local chat bugged out and didn't show players in the system. Players were unable to talk in any chat channels. Local chat for multiple systems would merge into one channel. People would be in system, logged in, and not appear in local. Local would stop updating players entering or leaving, making it look like it was fine but it was still fucked. 
---
I'm sure there are more, and one or more of these issues could be present at the same time.
---
In petition GM said, that they really made changes in signature spawning code, but hadnt approved, is it bug or feature. Already reported a bug, waiting for reply from developers.
---
I understand, now it all makes sense why everyone is so unhappy with CCP regarding the chat system..
---
So a little more backstory, I've been watching the mutaplasmid tracking site (idk if links are allowed) for a cap battery like this and I actually expected it to be a lot more expensive than it was once one along these lines finally popped up. They regularly sell in the 1.5-2b range and aren't quite this good (although some of the single stats often are). I picked it up as a collectible because I like collecting shiny things, but if I were to put it on my abyss cerb fit it would add 48 seconds of effective cap against a spawn of four starving leshaks over my current thukker large (1min 6 seconds -&gt; 1 min 54), which is definitely a bit of safety buffer in t5 abyss fits, if the risk tradeoff was worth it for someone.
---
Yes, it's still a video game like none other.
---
Player, will be around gates and small sites, unlikely to be around novice (t2's don't fit through the gate). Keep your wits about you 
---
I for one am glad that dreads past a certain point now pose an actual threat to supers. Tired of seeing a hundred+ dreads welped for a single titan and 5 supercarrier kills. Caps should completely shit on each other.
---
In my opinion it is dreads that should be the focal point of cap PVP. They are easy to get into for young-ish players and easy to replace logistically. They also don't require alt accounts.
---
And most importantly, the moment you hit siege on a dead, you are considered dead. Dreads light up killboards both ways and create stories to remember, supers getting stuck in 10% tidi unable to kill each other don't.
---
avesome thanks
---
I mean I'm happy too! we get 64 bit clients! We get to help beta test new tech! Fuck Rorq/Exca safety!  
---
But I trued to get a few people in to this game last year and god damn, broken Local did not help.... That and all of my peers get SP but somehow I am not worth an apology. I'm a little cheesed, I'll admit it.
---
That’s big, I would be pissed too if I had experienced the same thing for such a long time. Surprised this hasn’t been a priority to fix..
---
&gt; I have been debating with my friends on if we should get into EVE online or not and we can't seem to reach a conclusion so I have taken to Reddit to ask for your opinions. 
---
OK, here is my opinion on the subject. Note it will be different from other peoples opinions.
---
It all boils down to what it is you want to do while playing. If you wanna do NS stuff, then its absolutely not worth it. Its just fucking shitty cancer all around even with the changes and nerfs and all that. Multi boxing required, multiple accounts to be able to do anything decent at a good enough level. Sure you can scrub around on a single or double account, but thats like driving around in a car with a flat tire. Otherwise you have to either pay $$$$$ up the ass for all the accounts you'll need or grow a fucking brain tumor from farming of one sort or another for monthly plex.
---
What is worth it ? Small stuff and fucking around in HS, LS maybe some WHs. Its kinda cool and chill. 
---
What is and will be very much worth it and a ton of fun ? The upcoming Trig shit !!!! There is already AByss and Triglavian ships which are by far, really by far the most fun ships CCP has ever released, nothing else comes close to using these in the fun department. However, these are not newbie friendly. They require Omega for starters, so if your friends wanna stay alpha, they won't be able to use them. If you are an advanced / old player, you might wanna get some skill extractors and eitehr shuffle some skillpoints on your primary character, or suck em out of a secondary and pump them into Trig skills on primary (primary meaning has most relevant SP for all the support skills).
---
If you have never experienced Abyss and Triglavian ships yet because you haven't played in a long while, do not just jump into them, read up on all of it, do some serious research 1st before you hop into the Abyss. Also if you will be bringing friends, login and start playing, get yourself re-established before they come into the game.
---
Yes pls
---
Me too -- fortunately I work in civil aviation and there's enough ex-military types around that I rarely get someone who doesn't recognize it. I've actually had people ask if I was in the military after commenting that my radio etiquette is very good.
---
Don't have the heart to tell them I learned comms discipline from commanding internet spaceship fleets.
---
Working as intended. HTFU.
---
Rorqs are a real oddity, they are 10 billion isk ships/platforms with the DPS of a battleship. 
---
To make up for that they must either have a super cap sized tank or their value must decrease significantly, esp if their isk per hour is going down.
---
Yeah that's nice and all, but I have two small problems. 
---
1) I assume my account were Omega on March 20th 2018 but I'm not 100% sure.  
---
2) I still have unallocated skill points since the learning skills so I have no idea what so ever if I got 500,000 skillpoints some time about a year ago.
---
3) My logs show nothing.  
---
What’s your Recommend ship and fitting.
---
Also how many can you find an hour?
---
comparing 3x t2 armor rep apostles to 2x meta shield rep minos is disingenuous at best, and kind of ruins any idea that you aren't being bias for your own gain
---
The main defense we use for avoiding to lose rorquals is to prevent it from getting tackled at all. This involves mining pretty much during our groups prime time so max amount of pilots are available to keep eyes everywhere for hostiles, collapse all wormholes, and bubble camp entrances to our systems.
---
If our rorqs get tackled by 50-100 man gangs that came through a new wh rolling through (which we cant prevent) we will let it die, we will not drop our small amount of supers on it because we dont have the critical mass of supers to force off subcap fleets and if they get tackled, you being in a big group you will have contacts in most regions to bring more people. We also cannot fight off the 50-100 blokes with subcaps or carriers as we dont have numbers. An extra minute or so of being invulnerable is just delaying the inevitable.
---
Also, could you name an alliance you think thats part of a smaller-bloc because I think we have different definitions of a small alliance. For example I define my group as a small alliance and if we max rage cta form in advance we can pull maybe 25 humans.  
---
EVE has sound??
---
Good  balance changes:  selling my ratting Thanatos, Rorqual, and two Apostles.
---
The goals of nerfing mining, ratting, and capital proliferation met.
---
Congrats to the dev team.
---
No, it dose nothing in that context.
---
How about the cut off being the date they fixed it rather than the date they broke it?
---
What  a bullshit. Triglavian is a pacifist
---
renter groups in the north east, the rus/china groups in branch tenal area, gotg at times, certain parts of querious
---
They've not been part of Abyssal Space...but looks like these guys are a separate group acting as reps from outside of A-Space, not yet declaring if that's K or J.
---
They weren't constantly, and some were worse than others.
---
On the plus side, it revealed how many thousands of bots exist in eve onlineq
---
Why would you compensate based on the day the chat server was broken and not instead use the date you fixed it? 
---
Why are you comparing 3 T2 armor reps to 2 T1 shield reps? Who uses triple T2 armor fax? You dont have the PG for even 3 T1 reps with a cap transfer.
---
plzzzzz CCP pleaAAAAASE DON'T NERF MY SUPER FLEET
---
just adapt bro :\^)
---
They’re not only used in the giant x47/B-R style fights. 
---
Panfam used them to dunk Test’s dreads, Test used them to dunk a Frat Titan that tried to dunk a test bomber gang, and then test got dunked by even more titans. Goons routinely use them to smartbomb or boson people who try to kill their rorquals. 
---
They definitely have a huge role in the large scale battles, but that isn’t their only role 
---
&gt;You dont have the PG for even 3 T1 reps with a cap transfer.
---
Considering the imperium default fit does, I'm gonna say that's not right.
---
Besides, it doesn't sound like he's using T2.  He's meta-ing both, unless I'm misreading?
---
The lack of secondary guns on big ships was an interesting choice
---
im pretty sure i edited the post for capqu before you posted this ;p
---
Can you add a tldr
---
&gt; If these changes go into effect it is possible and likely that it will  have a strangling effect on the usage of supercapitals in any situation  where enemy dreadbomb forces are present. Even with the changes to  insurance a dreadbomb will trade so favorably against enemy  supercapitals once it reaches a specific numerical point that it will  quickly choke out supercapital content even against prepared foes 
---
That's the whole point - supers are an oppressive force. Legacy, Goons, and PL are exactly the people that should not be listened to in this regard.
---
It's a buff to dreads, which lesser groups can afford to field more of. 
---
For some sadistic reason, this makes me happy. 
---
wait, HK built the first keepstar?
---
Overhealing won't have an impact, as the returns are diminishing, not negative.
---
&gt;They would ONLY be deploy-able as home defense assets and in sort of an artillery style role.
---
I don't see a problem with this.  More importantly, I don't think CCP sees a problem either:
---
&gt; We want large ships losses to mean something 
---
I'll also point out that a [dread](https://evepraisal.com/a/ljvap) costs roughly 50% more than a [fax](https://evepraisal.com/a/ljvax), if for no other reason than you didn't cover it.
---
Now, I haven't been keeping up with current events, so what do engagement profiles usually look like?  You mentioned that 
---
&gt;dreadbombs now regularly move into the 300 range
---
but how many dreadbombs are smaller, how many faxes do people counter-drop, and how many faxes can they afford?  What sort of target would usually draw out 300 dreads?  Lastly, will dreadbombs change after the patch when attackers won't have to fight through as much logi?
---
Cause they want you to buy skill extractors...?
---
Yes sometimes in belts or anomalies you get a faction rat, for example dark blood somethign or shadow serpentis something. Those drop good loot and t2 salvage
---
20.03
---
This is funbased or what?
---
You can make up for the PANIC nerf by telling the Russian rorquals that get tackled to keep launching and recalling drones lmao
---
It was a long read.
---
20.04
---
The Discourse is fan-made. The Triglavian broadcast was taken out of the game.
---
in Many smaller group engagement FAX's will never get to this range. 
---
dreadbombs have been getting to the 300 level because that is the commitment large groups have pushed towards trying to kill enemy supers. 
---
Your right i didn't point out that the dreads are cheaper hullwise. However the standard dread costs LESS than the standard FAX after fitting. Since most dreads are currently fit purely for disposability. I wouldn't forsee this changing a ton.
---
If the patch goes through as is, dreadbombs would be insanely powerful to the degree that supercap usage around them would almost immediately come to a halt. 
---
Case in point
---
at the smaller scale these changes have basically no effect. If your not in the scale of 100 dreads then this whole discussion doesn't really affect you. 
---
This is about mass blobs fighting mass blobs. 
---
K
---
The lesson here is that if a significant bug appears, the correct course of action is to immediately unsub, and come back in a year when the bug is mostly fixed, and collect your reward for your patience and suffering through the bug. 
---
However, if you continue to play a buggy game, and the devs tell you "calm down, we'll be giving you compensation" and you calm down and continue to pay for it while you wait patiently for your compensation, you aren't going to get any compensation.
---
Hmm, no.  They actively sought out drifter fleets and destroyed them.  Definitely not pacifist. 
---
GL forming 300 dreads so you can kill supers now. This only affects big blobs because they can field the number of dreads needed to kill supers supported by fax. 
---
I really do wish they would cut the cost. At some point soon here putting excavators out isn't going to be worth it and everyone will swap to afk t2 miners to be lazy. I know I'd be much more interested in actually fighting if the ship and drones wern't a 15 billon hit. Instead the cost means I'm hyper vigilent and use the best defense...never get caught. It's super effective! And boring as fuck. 
---
&gt; but extra midslots don't really matter for the abaddon in a Fleet combat role.
---
It doesn't matter, except for TC and EWAR and SEBOs and Tackle but you'r right! 
---
I quit in 2013 and came back 2 months ago because EVE is the only mmo on the market where you can actually affect and interact with other players in **meaningful** ways. 
---
I don’t know. I wasn’t the one who bought it.
---
Are you saying you tried to restrict it for some, and the restrictions didn't take effect at all, allowing everyone to still have access?
---
Or that the restrictions were too severe, and it was preventing anyone from accessing?
---
It sounds like you're talking about the first one, where limitations aren't working. Which would probably make sense in a WH since there is no Sov or ownership or anything like that.
---
I am Triglaviam so dont tell me who I am
---
It means you can't panic save your shit vs. a dreadbomb under your supercap umbrella by dropping a million FAX. Which is a good thing as far as the health of the game is concerned. 
---
years ago I was part of a heist of a Nyx from Cobalt Edge that was left unpiloted in shield with a Rorq and another Nyx.  One day after DT they spawned, one got a decent bounce straight out of the shield... And yoinked...
---
naw you pretty much nailed that one.    
---
Is there enough time to ping more guys to get online
---
Can the Rorq buy more time with good tanking   
---
Your right on this hurts smaller groups but does nothing much to the larger groups.  
---
Put a couple of these on an abyssal gila and you would laugh in the face of a room full of tier 5 starving vedmaks
---
You're a sperg, that is what you are. 
---
same there
---
So the POCO configuration UI gives me the option to restrict access\set taxes for the POCO across each individual standing level. But what seems to be happening is that standings are getting ignored. Not sure if that makes sense 
---
Done it, gone trough interdimensional customs, gone to the bathroom, now my sympathy is waaay up my buthole 🖕. Now whats next? What was the fucking point of your post? How hard it is to pay for subscription if you don't have enough RL money? Dude I know, I played eve while I was a broke ass student where I couldn't afford 15 bucks for subscription because 15 bucks was as that time almost a week worth of food for me. The only reason I could kept playing EVE was that CCP had just introduced the option of paying for gametime via PLEX and I barely managed to farm the 300mil necessary to plex my main for a month. My past me is fucking envious for the options players have now (alpha clones etc) who don't want to pay real money for the game and still be able to play it.
---
I resubbed three days after, but I guess that means that the following 9 months worth of broken chat didn't affect me. Thanks for the ten years of half-assed customer service, ccp.
---
Boohoo
---
&gt; more titans than fax
---
What mongoloid has a Titan and no Fax. 
---
what fucking small group uses rorqs
---
Recently it has been. And they fixed the majority of issues.
---
hat what happens when guy jumps into jet engine
---
Fucking roleplayers...
---
They’ve always had a weird Russian twist to their vocabulary, and hilariously sound a lot like their dialogue is written by the guy who does the [Russian translation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b8ovA5JxHRZu0mLYJtthUaQkr1YPDl6Ws7_MjCX6xqw/htmlview#gid=1901349811) for eve.
---
Good point, I didn't consider fittings.  Zkill suggests [2.2bil](https://zkillboard.com/group/1538/losses/) per fax, [2.5bil](https://zkillboard.com/group/485/losses/) per dread (according to "recent" table), though there's probably some noise and this doesn't factor in insurance.
---
Still, I can't see some group saying "If it flies it dies" as a bad thing.  Short-term, more supercaps will die, long-term, maybe people won't use them as much.  To take an extreme example, maybe supercaps won't be the default response in places like Delve if they know faxes won't necessarily save them.
---
No shitpost is every too late, too inappropriate or too inconsequential!
---
Harvest ye your karma, you conspicuously cavorting capsuleer, for it is yours to have!
---
But the mass blob fights often aren't all that costly. A 40 on 40 deads-and-carriers cap brawl can easily result in as much isk lost as a 500 super v 500 fight that has a bunch of supers on grid on both sides, because the supers (except for the 1-2 that screwed up to start it all) don't actually die. This should help change that and bring the supercap parts of blobby fights in line with all other fights in Eve, where more people shooting = more ships exploding.
---
ok go back to your game
---
I hope CCP starts feeding you info ahead of time so you have time to make these and be relevant, you guys do great work 
---
A group that likes to takes of advantage of their large yield. 
---
Its worked out good for us so far, we just have to put in a bit more effort than the big entities.
---
They do now ;)
---
no super pilot and rorqual pilot are changing for VNI you dummy (because it's more healthy for the game right ?)
---
Yea
---
Thanks :3 We datamine enough of it, but really the most interesting part is to coming across it ingame first and then interacting with it.
---
Pretty much every high tier abysall pvper and pveer.
---
You forgot the velocity bonus on the vni will be removed 
---
https://pastebin.com/TS5Dz0Vx Have you tried something like this?
---
I'm pretty sure the thing you're advocating against is the entire point of the change. If someone drops several hundred dreads on a super fleet, *things should die*. That's the entire point - giving supers a predator again, other than just 'moar supers'. The perennial complaint that a super fleet is an apex force that can only be threatened by a bigger super fleet is what they're trying to address. The fact that super fleets won't be able to just throw their dicks around willy-nilly is a *good* thing.
---
I don't think that balance point was arrived at accidentally. I think it's an intentional choice to make it such that, once they hit critical mass, fax begin to decisively fall behind the dreads. That's what stops you from just being able to throw more ablative faxes at the problem - if fax can keep up with dreads, then you just add more fax. If someone manages to successfully drop hundreds of dreads on a super fleet and actually get everything to work out right, then they deserve the kills. 
---
Fax nerfed too hard, dreads supreme now.
---
the changes im talking about will have no affect on delve either way
---
AFAIK nothing stops people from using a poco, you can only set the tax rate.
---
How do you screw that much up with just chat system,.
---
I've got a comparable one plus nicely rolled large shield booster, I've not remotely run out of cap for like two months now
---
Everyone will be farming abyssals now taking them out of normal space and into the non-interactive abyssal space. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74737705/
---
Not exactly, but similar. I used this for setting up stop bubbles and camping them for a few minutes before moving on. Nestor has 1 of the highest scan res out of all the battleships, so id be able to lock like a cruiser
---
People are donating money to a guy streaming a mining fleet? I hate people
---
&gt; Jita local was literally fucked
---
Oh man! Did you, like, urgently need your isk doubling? Were you hoping to buy a Vexor for 15b in the hope that it was really a Guardian Vexor this time? Did you want to buy 1 injector for the price of 5? Was there an overpriced underwhelming abyssal mod you desperately needed for your sick fit?
---
Hit me up, fam. I got you.
---
Some people have to pay extra for that.
---
How
---
Drifters don't count as people.
---
Trust me, the changes as they are only benefit a group like TEST
---
I’m in a null block but I used to spend A LOT of solo time in W-space. Once citadels came, W-space got pretty boring. W-space changed from being a difficult place to live with interesting things to discover to just another system but with non-static gates.
---
As much as they were a huge PITA to run and maintain, I miss W-space POSses so much. I wish they would bring them back in an updated form and remove the citadels. Not going to happen, but one can dream.
---
Good
---
That's fine with us.  TEST will only benefit from not needing to use our supers in a war.  We're just advocating for what we think is best for the game.  The changes as they stand right now benefit TEST greatly.
---
In whs you can restrict access supposedly. But anyway, the tax rates aren’t adjusting to different standing levels anyway. Not sure what’s going on 
---
Higher plex prices are good for the smaller players, smaller players buy plex and sell for ISK, its the big bois that buys plex to plex their accounts.
---
Don't even... 5 resubbed acts, much salt... :S
---
Hate is too strong a word to describe him. Olmeca Gold is *ridiculed* because he has an enormous hate boner for all things Goon and everything he posts is colored by his prejudice. I don't know what happened to make him so incredibly butthurt, but he claims to have inflicted trillions in damages in retaliation and has yet to get over it.
---
Objectively, he's a an excellent pilot. So many pilots hold grudges and make empty threats, but Olmeca knows his enemy, hits them where it hurts, and even found a profitable way to do it.
---
sounds like you're scared your supers will die
---
i may need a DT for the changes to apply. 
---
no kurwa nie moge... przez prawie rok czasu mojego pobytu na Islandii niekompetntna kurwa deweloperska powszechnie znana jako CCP bawila sie moim zyciem uzywajac roznych form nacisku, czasami rownie obrzydliwych jak twoja ksywka ty pierdolony idioto... w odpowiedzi na to chwycilem za pioro i pisalem o wszystkim co sie dzieje dookola... i tak o to niekompetentna kurwa deweloperska postanowila ze na podstawie tego co pisze oraz co soba prezentuje, a to wiedzieli doskonale bo osaczyli i invigilowali mnie z kazdej strony... postanowil ze sobie wymysla jeszcze jedna rase do swojej gierki w ktora kurwa nawet nie gralem bo jest chujowa jak twoja ksywka jebany idioto... a teraz wymyslaja sobie jeszcze wpjenki z udzialem tej wymyslonej przez siebie rasy ktora zostala stworzona ze zbioru MOICH tekstow i zachowan.. ale nie kurwa... przypelznie taki jebany robak i bedzie mnie pouczal kim sa Triglavianie... ja pierdole co za chory pojebany swiat
---
That's a difficult point to argue against to be honest, ironically the chat server broke the day before they rolled out the SP so you never know they might do it again 
---
don't get me wrong, when i sat in jita with 40 talos or tornados instapopping jfs coming in i loved not having local show that i was in system for months at a time
---
unfortunately the majority of my kills got reimbursed, and CCP didn't want to reimburse my losses for the reimbursed JFs
---
&gt;  So, lets remove a high and shift it to a mid. If CCP really wants the DPS value high to set it apart from an Oracle, then increase damage bonus to 10% per level with 7 turrets.
---
Nooooo, reducing the number of guns whilst not changing the model always makes the ship look janky af. This is what they did with the Hyperion and it looks so stupid now.
---
Never said they were? 
---
i like that you are actually being downvoted lol
---
I miss guard :( and I miss my Eve friends :(
---
sensor boosters... Sensor Boosters everywhere
---
They save titans with their patented E.M.A.I.L. system
---
YEah
---
I wonder if the game was ever playable without faxes 
---
:thinking:
---
Ahh could be. Thanks for the heads up 
---
Yep! I'm having a great time.
---
Who says that you can't fly a small lazor avatar?
---
haef again
---
hey it will be healthier for the game ok ? As long as delve lose money reddit will be fine
---
Can you clarify or expand on this?  Simplistically, small groups can build dreads much more easily than supercaps, so shifting the balance of firepower towards dreads and away from supers should put more power into small groups.
---
He solo bashed a structure that literally costs less than most tech's. I dont see the issue here.
---
Not really.  They come nowhere close to the NSA.
---
pro tip: If I have a flair active im not being serious.
---
Right now im serious.
---
i will mostly repeat what others did say:
---
1. don't fight worm u will always loose in a tormentor.
---
2. OVERHEAT your ancil armo repairer always! Not a single cycle should run without heat.
---
3. preheat your web in a defensive situation. you get 13km web range instead of 10km. once target is within 10km stop heating. (When you try to catch somebody to get close use heat aswell)
---
4. Try to use hotkeys, use mouse for some stuff, but weapon, webs, prop mod and scram should normally be within hotkeys. Some dudes use non-default hotkeys which is cool. I usually  just stay with F1, F2, F3, F4 ... then i usuall have gun on F1 like it is default, tackle onf F2 and F3 and prop mod on F4. But that is basically a question of flavour. Clicking your repper is normal though.
---
5. You did engage your scram much too late which was the reason why he did get that close. See point 4 about hotkeys. Preheat the scram, it gets extra range heated aswell. Once he is in normal scram range stop heating it.
---
6a. Don't use a T1 web. Use a "meta" web: probably a compact if you can make use with extra cpu on your fit and your skills or with enduring as said.
---
6b. Don't use a T1 afterburner. Use meta aswell. Enduring or compact.
---
7. Reapeating other dudes: don't waste your capacitor before a fight in a plex.
---
8. Aswell: carry Imperial Navy Multifrequency ammo. Use it as default.
---
9. Either be without velocity or be aligned out in case you want to warp. Before the fight begins you have to be where you want the fight to start. So either at 0 or at your desired range.
---
10. I'm missing at least velocity tab on your overview tab. I think that is crucial for information.
---
11. I would get confused with an overview which is sorted by type and not by range, but if it works for you that is alright.
---
12. Your manual piloting is cool and that is definitly a skill which you want to develop on the long run. Maybe for now it would be easier though if you would set a good distance for "keep at range" (~7500m ish i would get, but depends on fit and ship) and just smash that one if you get into a fight.
---
13. Keep doing solo PvP in frigates. Definitly the way to go. Maybe look if you finde some resources on youtube regarding frig pvp. Read that frigate PvP yearbook which is linked in this thread. It is the best. For now just read for the tormentor and whenever you encounter something new after action you may look it up. Try to remember a little bit what ship can do what and whatnot. Your engagement profile is key.
---
Mildly irrelevant but what cerb fit do you use for T5? 
---
Oh my bad i meant from a lore perspective .
---
It's just a petty scapegoat, TAPI is weaker with these changes, so they are making a "think of the little guys!!" strawman argument
---
The same one which gave us astrahus that could only be shot 3 specific hours a week before 2018. 
---
well yeah of course but if it's either 1 minute siege cycle or warp away instantly I will prob choose the warp
---
I had a little jaunt through your space this evening and it was rammed with bots. 
---
They probably have something to do with the tidi.
---
2x fun
---
Hopefully once you have diminishing returns on fax people start countering dreads with their own dreads as well. Or maybe being more aggressive with Tatiana and supers to make use of cap gun DPS instead of LR guns.
---
Are you not concerned that armour supers can dual tank better?
---
Yes. It’s free brah. The only thing you will miss out on is the thousands of hours and family life you once had because you got hooked and you will not be able to stop playing or thinking about it. But seriously it’s free, there isn’t any commitment besides having an open mind and a few hours to fly around. There is no other game like this one. I love it.
---
lol so you - PGL - and are coming out to reject a change that \*benefits\* TEST? 
---
Not buying it :P
---
to all triglavians.  i will pod you all  whatever leshaks and vedmaks you bring.
---
Not at the current rep cap no.  If it got increased to the suggested rate in Vily's post I would be, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
---
they do but rare
---
This also only makes sense to Americans.
---
The dreads are only strong if you can field 300+ of them like we easily can
---
Hail Liek DarZ!
---
when local would go down hundreds of bots would break and just feed to players hunting them
---
countless supers and vnis died those days
---
nope
---
Honestly you just deactivate the NSA right after targeting the last group, by the time you kill the last of the rats you should be at least halfway through the NSA cycle
---
It looks like reversion to the mean. The spew in this subreddit doesn't seem particularly different from usual. If anything, it seems less inflammatory than I'm used to seeing. There may be some effect from people not happy about the way the free SP is being handed out, but I would expect to see an uptick of people thankful for the SP tonight rather than more of a downturn.
---
*Not like this...*
---
How many faxes have to be on grid before they hit the point of no return.  And how many dreads need to be dropped to over come that.   Larger groups will still throw supers around in their space.  Because your still looking at large number needed to kill things.   
---
yassss lol
---
What’s a good way to make ISK solo these days?
---
Plus I think youll be able to fit 10 excavators now!!!! I highly recommend this
---
Your point is valid but this could've been literally like 2 sentences and gotten the point through just fine.
---
As Jaret said! Honestly, we don't need CCP to feed us info, we figure it out when it goes live, or even before it goes live. :D  
---
Still, thanks for the compliment! Always happy when our work is appreciated.
---
Dreads dont require alts? Well no, strictly speaking they don't.
---
Except in the real world, I bet like 70% of dreads ARE alt accounts. Lol.
---
I approve of these so called... pictorial narratives.
---
There were also instances of fleet chat being transmitted to local/ the fleet chat of any fleet in the system. Players appearing in local when they are multiple regions away. instances with nobody in local chat (which was nice to kill bots/ do whaling). one extremely interesting occasion where players were able to right click warp to anyone in local 
---
Which Abyss levels is the Phantasm good for?
---
That sounds like the kind of password an idiot puts on their luggage
---
There's a short and reliable series of steps:
---
1. Make posts in r/eve
---
2. Get enough people to upvote your posts that they get seen
---
3. That's it. I can't think of a single example of someone who did (1) and (2) who isn't "hated" by "people".
---
On a more specific note, Olmeca has opinions about things, particularly including *balance* things, and has voiced those opinions. The fact that they have done so in a remarkably articulate and even-handed way is sadly irrelevant. There are plenty of people in this subreddit who have difficulty engaging in conversation on topics related to their interests without moving directly to hate and flame.
---
Gosh, you're right, we'd better nerf faxes again!  40 faxes should reduce reps to 10% so those dreads don't go to Valhalla empty-handed!
---
More seriously, this is incorrect.  By nerfing faxes, you're reducing the amount of DPS required to be considered "overwhelming force".  This is shifting the balance in favor of the attacker, as the defender cannot rely on faxes to keep him alive indefinitely and must destroy enough of the attacking force quickly to save their target.  Which means attackers don't need as many dreads.
---
Yes, this cuts both ways: big guys have more firepower than small guys.  The key is that the big guys have more targets which are now more likely to be lost.
---
Lastly, I asked you to **clarify or expand** on this.  Vague allegations are not that.

and your enemies, and people that want to hunt your supers, can

Your homework, if you choose to accept it: Ask people to send you in their Leshak damage logs on cruisers/bc/bships etc, then when you've compiled a data set of around 10 for each, configure the polynomials to adjudicate the proper numbers so we can then get a proper proven average that more accurately reflects the scale up of the damage \*adjusts glasses frames\*  i'd like to see those numbers on my desk at your earliest convenience Mrs. Katherine silens.   Hopefully you will acquiesce my homework. Class dismissed.  \*remember to study for the pop quiz tomorrow class!\*
---
&gt; They also don't require alt accounts
---
no
---
plese don't do that
---
\&gt;:|
---
I guess it's just very hard to defend against a titan that's solo bashing a citadel? What do you even do vs it?
---
Exploration is still good, abyssal sites are very good. If you don't mind running several alts at once you can setup in a WH and get solid isk that way. Blitzing burner missions is also decent.   
---
I'm assuming by solo you mean not as part of a NS block or other corp.
---
Sounds like you have shitty fleet discipline and fleet commanders .
