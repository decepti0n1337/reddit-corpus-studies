Great story, its things like these that made me teach my two daughters how to kickbox. Had an older girl in the same school district take her life due to bullying and I made sure my little girls knew how to defend themselves before something like that could happen. Also made sure they knew it didn't matter what the popular kids thought, if they saw someone being bullied I expected them to step in the same way I did as a kid.

Well played sir

I've seen a parent shout at his own kid that they weren't  getting dinner. That's not the worst I've seen, but it stands out in my memory as ridiculous. For clarity, these were 5 and 6 year olds, most of them could barely stand on the ice, let alone keep to their position. The guy was furious that his kid wouldn't stay in position and just chased the puck, like every 5 year old who is just learning hockey.

Yes

As I recall I didn't threaten anybody, it was a HK member who randomly told me to "go play on the interstate".

You should ask around your corp/alliance for references, if you have good standing getting to w-space in a real way will be faster, lots of well reasoned paranoia among wormholers.

Thanks, I finally got it to work. No idea how, though. I've restarted the mission a dozen times and there was never a location to fly to. Relogged now and there it was. Guess it might have been some kind of bug.

---
there's a lot of stations but unless I've been misinformed, only one of them is within JF range of lowsec.  Don't you need to jump into T-N from Saminer?
---
Also I wouldn't recommend putting supers in somebody else's keepstar, but it is there and it is open to people that aren't Test.  If you're on good terms with Good Sax there's no real risk of staging there because worst case scenario you just asset safety it across the grid to the True Creations house.

You can just buy one via public contracts if you don't want to farm for it, which may be a much more efficient use of your time if you make ISK via other methods.

Or u can scan combat sites in guristas low sec and get bpc drops or pith invuls which worth alot

How are hard knocks doing?
---
Hunting is heavily based on the laziness or poor programming of the prey. 
---
1. Near2 and other programs of it's type paired with good intel channels make it so many ratters or even rorqual pilots can dock before the hunter ever makes it to the target system.
---
2. Even without intel channels or eyes next door, the prey sees the enemy enter local chat several seconds before the other gets to warp or even dscan.
---
3. All common ratting ships (even undersized mwd supers) can more often than not align off faster than the hunter can jump in to the system and land at an anom even if it's only a 1 au warp.
---
Don't be sloppy. Don't die.
---
Make hunting more tediious? lmao.

and yeah the lvl 3 gurista arc gives i a 1 run bpc and you can farm standings to a corp in hi-sec to run them, on https://eve-survival.org/wikka.php?wakka=SmashAndGrab3p1 there is a list or all the corps that gives the arc (you dont need faction standings)

lots of kids dont have decent male role models. you dont have to be his only friend, but you can take some time out of your day to have a positive influence on the boy.
---
Let’s say you take your bad self into a random wormhole to go explore, mine, rat, etc. Today, you can cloak up if you need to get away from someone or go to a safe spot to log out. 
---
If you need ozone to do this, you now have less cargo space to do everything else. By definition you (should) presume that you are always being cloaky camped when in a WH. 
---
Congratulations. You have now introduced a solution that causes more problems without solving anything.
---
Let’s say you are in a bomber/blops fleet. You’re flying in a glass cannon that relies entirely on cloak and range to be even remotely survivable.
---
If you need ozone to do this, you now have less cargo space to do everything else. By definition that means you can carry less ammo (potentially significantly less ammo) and have broken the fundamental gameplay of the ship by introducing an extra logistics component (reloading ozone for cloaking) that didn’t exist before.
---
I could go on. But your suggestion is breaking more things that have zero to do with the problem you’re trying to solve. All you’d be encouraging people to do is use cloaky Tayras to camp with for weeks at a time.

If you get yourself into Scalding Pass and find it, yes you can.  It's floating 175k above a gate next to my corpse, an MTU and a mobile depot.

This is great.

Delve core, Fountain Core. Delve core died because Goons needed a new home. Fountain core died by a combo of infighting to start with making the old alliance join chaos theory and the rest of them joined Goons.

Yeah, i'm not digging through chat logs for you. You can do that yourself if you want. It's not like anyone would be surprised at you doing that with how cringe you are with anything involving HK lol.
---
Why? There aren't any tactics involving booshing and aggression that people complain about, all you can really do is use it to snatch people off gates, which is easily counterable by either jumping or letting them do it and then killing them. It's a dumb change that only makes turtling on gate safer.

If 80 people are shut down because of 2 campers they need to grow a pair and/or stop being so lazy. That’s ridiculous. Just assume that you’re going to be dropped and play accordingly. If they can’t beat whatever is going to drop on them they will probably have a hard time defending a timer too.

Anyone who knows how to do a logoffski well can cause just as much chaos as a cloaky camper can.

Dc'd in FW space while doing a novice Plex. Got spanked :(

Shit that sounds awesome. I used to encourage my people fly COSMOS fitted AFs or faction frigs when we were running sites so the loot drops would be publicity. Policy did not last long.
---
Sure there is. 
---
Cyno your bad self to another system with a gate camp ready to go and mine there. Pick off the campers as they move to the new system.
---
So you lied, got caught and then made an ass of your self in front of /r/eve .  \*Slow Clap\*
---
Out of curiosity are COSMOS mods still the only ones named with punctuation?
---
While the website is pretty similar it seems to me that it's just a guy trying to make a browser game. Both the logo and most of the images used here is either free / stock images or something similar. Likely pretty inspired by EVE.
---
To be fair, had it been some other small game studio trying to make a ripoff / carbon copy it would've been a different story.

\&gt; asked if HK would be supporting my CSM bid in 2019 
---
I wouldn't support you even if I was a step ladder
---
The guy gets bitten, doesn’t go to the hospital, dies from rabies a few months later.
---
Yeah I think so which is ironic considering just how on the ropes we were. I remember sitting in saranen and thinking about the daily fleet roams we had. Most of our enemies we fought seemed a push over. The only real fights we got that seemed hard were against Pandemic Legion and TEST.  Shadow cartel also seemed tough at the time but that seemed more to do with their surprise ambushes. It was more the sheer numbers that had us pinned down that kept us staged in lowsec.
---
The Fabian strategy actually played out afterwards when PanFam turned on TEST.  Biggest mistake they ever did make. The reason it took so long to move down to Delve was due to asset recovery needs of members and researching where to go next. Then we had to make a safe Highway to get there which took time too. When TEST moved south we fought with Stainwagon against test. That was another paper tiger overstretched empire which increasingly became impossible to save much like the DRF. Both Stain and the DRF made the same mistake Goons made in the North by being overstretched.
---
Yeah, I mean for AFs cosmos mods are great tbh since fitting tends to be crap, shame they have gone up in price so significantly recently with every other faction/deadspace mod
---
Boooooooossshhhh
---
They went up because supercap proliferation. I have been keeping an eye out.
---
My best Eve-friend has all titan BPO, all super BPO, a fortizar BPO (another 70b) ... the list goes on and on.

He's a mega industrialist, and super avid PvP-er (he doesn't mind losing a dread everytime he destroys a Goon freighter or jump freighter).
---
Some people don't play the same Eve as the rest of us :)
---
I haven’t been baited like that in a long time. Good job
---
FCon messes up big time due largely to their leadership’s decision making I’d say. They could of survived in tact with the right diplomacy.
---
Project Mayhem folded into snuffed out.
---
I am willing to put some on supercaps, but that doesn't explain why many subcap mods have exploded, I blame the abyss, partially cause so many items die in there, and partially cause a ton of people that used to do lower end deds are just doing abyssals now
---
It does when they haven’t had a single strategic win since “it” started just losses.
---
We can only hope
---
Well there is a bug where you can actually jump somebody off of gate and then jump the gate at the same exact server tick
---
High-sec. gets a lot of crap, but as someone who has done a little of everything in Eve, I’m really enjoying it this time around. The wardec changes have made it possible to grow, and being able to work with new players is a lot of fun.
---
There’s still PvP to had as well (especially with WH daytripping and such). Come join us up here :D
---
No, you are just literally mentally retarded if you think i'm going to sift through weeks of public channel logs to find you acting foolish to show Reddit.

Input broadcasting a chat message is exactly what the goon that I linked earlier did.  And he was banned (as a first time offender he is back in game).
---
Mar5hy should at the least receive that same punishment.  The characters in question were ALL undocked, it just appears that he broadcasted on his campers instead of his normal droppers is all.
---
Fuck yes, great shitpost
---
I was talking COSMOS specifically. If you look at the data, use of COSMOS mods on supers have exploded. Same with BLOPS. Who the fuck is farming that many smokescreens I would love to know.
---
I would also like to know this. Burn Jita is a good time!
---
The Boveril part of it folded into Goons. 
---
In the early part of the war The OSS was hitting us goon renters in Pure blind. My own corp at the time lost considerable assets to them and gorgon empire. Most of us renters ended up leaving Goons or disbanding and some of us joined Goonswarm proper or after leaving soon did so. I was one of these after our corp left Goons a few months later I rejoined to try and get revenge during the Casino War. Ironically it wasn’t until faction forts came in that I finally recovered my assets.
---
Regardless of the name mark be you could answer the actual questions?
---
Seconding neuts and e-war. It doesn't matter how many ships you kill, they can be replaced.
---
Neuting and constantly jamming wastes time. It pisses them off. It makes attacking much more difficult, especially if they're multiboxing. It makes the fight not fun, and that is much more likely to drive them away. If they have to spend 5 hours doing a task that should only take 1, that's far more likely to get rid of them than destroying their ships.
---
This is very nice I love  it :)
---
It took you more than 5 minutes to write this post. For me its shocking that for more than 5 minutes you thought any of this wasnt incredibly cringy. 
---

This already existed a few years back and everyone complained so much they reverted the change. Don't see it making a come back 
---
Yeah, it's interesting how Eve has so many similarities with Real life in terms of stuff like that. Rich people IRL have so much money that they spend it on what many would consider pointless and frivolous things, pretty similar to Eve rich people and visa versa. Funny enough, I think it would be more fun to be Eve rich than IRL rich, at least in Eve you don't have to be constantly watching your back for somebody trying to take your wealth, unless you count scammers of course.

One interesting point is that KarmaFleet also came from Reddit and is now the largest corporation in Goons.

Is this the kind of CSM abuse that guy was talking about in the other thread?

Attention whore much?
---
I don't even really hate the guy, I just think he's unqualified and offers very little to the game.  He should just go back to being Goon pet number 13475.  Unfortunately, it's just so easy to show what a bad CSM he is.  Half the time I make shit up to see what happens, and players come out of the woodwork to agree with me.  
---
I can’t see why the Imperium would want that shitty space. Not sure about TEST.
---
High fives all round!
---
go to wh directly tbh
---
Fun fact, you ran for a space student council and made yourself a public figure.  I think you suck at your job.  Your constant need for attention simply provides me a forum to highlight your overall terrible job on the CSM. 
---
Totally different.

---
Dude you're not even a politician - it's a fake student council for a fake spaceship game.  Being proud of your election to the CSM is like winning the gold medal at the special olympics.  You got 30,000 goon mouth breathers to mash F1 on a ballot.  Good for you. Here's your participation trophy.

Instead of waiting you could be out there making it happen yourself.

Seriously, some of the worst parents you can imagine at kid's games. My teams were from the majority poor black part of the city, these families were from the working class white neighborhood across the river. r/eve has nothing on the vitriol and hate that came out of those people when we had to play them.
---
 no one cares what you are irl fuck off
---
its not the kills that make it post worthy. its the fact that they decided to warp a subcap fleet into their own bubble fuckery with 2 supers  already on grid (they had been on grid from the beginning). after sacing 1.3 worth of dics to hold down a rorqual that was already out of siege in the middle of our supercap umbrella (which im pretty sure they know since tuskers die en mass to us almost weekly). not to mention it took them 10 minutes to get on grid from the time their first dic landed. 
---
in general this was a terrible, no good, very bad whaling fleet from a group that is focused on pvp and frequently attempts to kill our miners.   
---
  
---
I love you Brisc. I think about you too often
---
restart the launcher
---
Close the client and launcher. Re launch the launcher and it should update. Wait for the update to finish before starting a client again. Best practice is to close the launcher before downtime. 
---
No one tell him.
---
It just makes it funnier.
---
Against the alliances we deploy against, panfam and gotg if that is the case they are fucked. We dont deploy against provi or brave to take their space we leave that to lesser alliances. 
---
I love you, too. 
---
And like every other group of people who yanked their dicks on reddit or the forums about their ELIETE SMALL GAUNG PVP Hardknocks fucked off and quit after experiencing the reality of: Talk Shit, Get Hit.
---
Fun fact, you don't play this game anymore and you're still stalking me. There's something really, really wrong with you. 
---
There’s an idea in literature titled ‘suspension of disbelief’. You should look this up rather than becoming an extremely cynical, condescending, and sarcastic online persona.
---
such density much wow
---
I did that first, but I'll try again.
---
No one said it would be fresh.
---
I did that first, but I'm retrying now.
---
Who the fuck chose Trump over Brisc...
---
Fuckin Bonesaw right right there!
---
I actually kinda liked it when it didnt refresh, now I'm getting all of my distances mixed up.
---
Just for that, you're not getting invited to McDonald's Night at the White House. 
---
Next time you'll be nicer. 
---
Every day. 
---
Fun fact, nobody will remember you in a month. 
---
no
---
What do you mean wish?
---
again dude
---
no one cares if you go to the white house
---
Oh fuck yeah this is the winner for me regardless of the outcome.
---
TBH it's the best EVE video I've seen since I joined
---
Yep I've been on the opposite end of this, saw myself land off grid with them on their stream and then vanish from view as I had successfully jumped.
---
I always knew the CSM was a little tainted.
---
I don't even play anymore because of the broken wardec system. I told myself i won't ever play due the absolutely stupid and unfun wardec mechanic in this game. I am merely one out of the countless ex players who left for the exact same reason. 
---
This change does give me hope, but enough to sub again? Who knows. Eve left a really sour taste in my mouth.
---
I kept looking and didn’t see it. Oh well
---
If other players being able to cause you to lose ships was a bad game experience, never come back. You will always hate EVE.
---
You are aware that hes an IRL politician right? Oh... yeah, that's a thing btw.
---
I get it when parents being over protective on more physical games like football or basketball, but baseball? Really?
---
If you booshed them off succesfully...why does it matter? Either you failed and they're gone, or you succeeded and you have them tackled 100km off gate. 
---
If it's that bad move to w-space. Polarization is a hell of a drug. 
---
GJ that CCP got the copyright in for square blue boxes last year.
---
coons!?  when racoons tried to get on our back porch mama would just chase 'em off with a broom.
---
I have to admit you're really good at pretending to be retarded.
---
*NANI?*
---
It's a known bug I think, it was posted after the release notes somewhere?
---
Seems like a cool guy, let's not ruin his day
---
Yo sue represent!
---
That BR tho, :cripes:
---
It's really fucking weird. 
---
I see what you did there.
---
Let's see how many times you morons can not get the joke tonight. 
---
Very true. Back in the day Goons used to hate on us for being from Reddit.
---
These look fundamentally the same as police skins did applied to normal ships when that bug allowed you to apply any skin to any ship vOv
---
Got me.....sigh
---
I'm going to have Trump fly them on Air Force One. 
---
Florida? Thatd be nice.
---
Fuck it ill help too. when is the timer? where do we need to be?
---
I never minded losing ships. I disliked the mechanic where I spent 75% of my time wardecced so I couldn't play the game. I could suit up and fly out and die 30 times a week. And then what? You literally can't do anything when permanently wardecced. Your income stream for a newb is 0 under a wardec. You just go to an NPC Corp, and try to scrape the isk needed to afford your skill books and ships as you progress, but it's lonely and so it's no wonder people leave Eve.  
---
I've always wondered, what the true numbers are for the reason each person left Eve. And would wardecs be the +75% reason why everyone did? For the 100+ ppl or so I played with over the course of 2 years in various hisec corps, it would be about 98%. That can't be a unique experience.
---
If the joke isnt funny its a shit joke my dude
---
That's cheating.  -5 points for Gryffindor.
---
CSM isnt relevant anymore, or theyd have pushed ccp to fix local a year ago
---
Ferrata tried killing a Deadhand fort. Batphoned all the putins you can imagine. TEST, Deadhand, Scourge and Wild Souls said come n get it. They chickened out.  30 minutes of cyrillic discussion in local and thats it. 
---
In the grand scheme of things it wouldn't matter.  The customer sets the collateral to whatever they deem necessary.   So if a PushX pilot loses it they are out.   
---
We don't mention this place where the null people can see it. Eddy is overworked enough as is.

Brisc Rubal wins the reddinet
---
I need to do that to fit in with you guys. 
---
Literally no one. That’s why he had to post this garbage. 
---
bit cringe if I'm honest 
---
probably 5ilent
---
Man I hope you are kidding.  Rabies is a painful way to go.
---
You're the only one not laughing my dude. 
---
not sure which is worse you posting this for attention or you going through all the comments and replying to them for more attention
---
your*
---
Made my night 
---
And the best part is this was mostly a goon led csm initiative.
---
not sure which is worse you being in tishu or nope that's worse. 
---
But you're not, so go ahead and laugh. Loosen up. 
---
Right. Which doesn't seem like a problem to me. 
---
i can read the rest of the thread bud, doesn't really look like its just me
---
/u/Cpt_Soban please record this happening, everyone loves a good keepstar DD :D
---
the problem with that is that the boosher is then unable to be caught, ever
---
Well played. Have my upvote. 
---
Join a c2 wormhole Corp. it’s the new small gang meta. 
---
I laughed 
---
Was a good bamboozle, what's with the salt levels in here? 
---
I thought jams allowed you to continue targeting the jammer.
---
I wasn't in any bloc at the time that happened and was so confused why everybody was so concerned about it. The big thing it seemed to be used for was station games and bubble hazing - which seemed weird to me because everything else requires anchoring something or taking aggression. So why not bubbles?
---
It's like yeah - you lose some defensive capabilities when trying to run away since you can bubble gates to slow down the people chasing you. That seemed to be a big winning argument at the time to keep bubbles aggression-less. But isn't it more interesting figuring out as an FC if you want to try and have your dictor bubble to try to save the fleet, potentially losing it in the process? You'd want to be absolutely sure you can slow them down in the right place to give you the best chance of making it out alive.
---
Why does the voice of reason get downvoted in this shitty, toxic sub?
---
nice to see local stuff
---
Enhance.
---
Now that you guys are in nullsec, are you still recruiting?
---
Save some extra nuggets for me! 
---
If the major game reveals are still going to be at EVEsterdam....why go to the others? 
---
I still don't fully understand what these are if there aren't different major game reveals at each. Like I get it's a replacement for fanfest but...are there talks? Tournaments? Is it a meet &amp; greet or pub crawl? Like what are these tickets even for if the main stuff's gonna be at EVEsterdam/EVE Vegas anyways. 
---
ah shut up you twat
---
 wait that isn't the case?
---
Ok.
---
Hi.  I'm listening.
---
Nah it's just you.

:pepehands:

Just lose some vital minutes before abandoning flesh itself.

thats a good image thanks

u know the sub is dead when youre allowed to post garbage threads like this

bring it to curse please specifically HLW-HP since im jump cloned up there

Be boosher, be 100k off gate, boosh to gate through interdiction bubbles, jump gate with booshed friends. 
---
And this guys name is empire builder...
---
Shh. 
---
Okay this stuff is stuff that doesn't make me want to never come back, unlike 90% of the content here in r/EVE. Thanks for that Brisc, and ouch, dealing with irate parents who don't know any better about their kids' sporting ability sucks ass.
---
Remember when people would come to scaling pass for content *on purpose*? Those were good times.
---
What's your face
---
Can confirm. The newish coalition-name kinda... dunno it just doesnt stick for me.
---
Knfaoowo 🤪🤪🤪 you really showed them 😱😱🤯🤩🤩 thank you for this EPIC victory ROYAL😎😎🤓😎🤪🤪 in the name of PROVIBLOC!!!👌👌👌✌️✌️😍
---
Yes cause that's how CSM works... On the bright side both your name and your comment demonstrates your willful ignorance resoundingly... So you got that going for you.
---
If you have to tell the audience to laugh your jokes probably not the best... 
---
Who the fuck even are you?
---
Pretty sure this is such a low hanging fruit given the original was nasa iirc
---
people are downvoting this lmfao, my impression of reddit was already that it's chock full of dumb people pretending to be smart, and it's 100% correct
---
We are going to need an update on this please.

jokes &gt; toxicity my dude

be funny in your toxicity or fuck off

Someone figured out how to win in Eve
---
Laughing it off is great but you have a real problem.
---
You're on every forum, every show, every event saying the same thing you say at every show, every forum and every event, never taking a hard stance and mostly staying in the middle, which might be for good reason but with the NDA restrictions, those reasons are never truly communicated to the players.
---
You're overexposed, and there's nothing this sub hates more, if anyone dominates the sub for a week, be it goons/init/tapi/nc/pl/horde whatever, they spend the next month or so getting bullied for lack of a better word.
---
I just realised in the middle of writing this that i dont care have a nice day everyone
---
the proteus would like a word with you
---
At a quick glance, someone whos very interested in Briscs taint
---
boosher has 85 seconds before next one, and add on that hic points would still block mjfgs.
---
boosher can still get alphad in large fleet comp
---
small fleet comp it can still be caught
---
&gt; more CPU stress on the server

I think it's purely client-side change.

How does this compare to prior years?

lol  people like you suck. make you feel better to post useless comments like these?
---
Yes this is a bit confusing. The non-hackable repair station entity gets replaced with a hackable one when you get the turret. There even is a small explosion. If you had it locked you lose lock and have to re-lock the new one. This is how it used to be, at least-  I have not gotten this site since patch yesterday, so don't know if CCP bugged it on patch day.
---
OOF
---
Wait, isn't this the reason why any of us become parents?
---
If not, I think I fucked up.
---
My favorite production line :

---
As soon as Message &gt; &lt;color=0xffffd800&gt;The hostile sentry guns on the area have started targeting the rewired sentry gun. Might it be possible to help it out in some way?&lt;/color&gt;
---
displays there's a huge explosion at the repair station.  Even after flying to the hackable point at the (new?) repair station and succeeding, the helped turret still dies, followed one by one  the enemy turrets, until about 2 minutes later there's a grand finale and everything explodes leaving me crying about the tens of millions that just poofed.  Happened 3 times now in different systems.  I did submit a ticket, for what that's worth :/
---
the problem with the old system was that there were almost no "good" corps in highsec. because any knowledgeable CEO or member knew they would be war decced out of existence so they either were in the NPC corp or solo tax havens. this only left "bad" corps in highsec who prayed on uninformed members, taught them nothing, taxed them and ran bad buybacks.
---
now there is the possibility of "good" highsec corps becoming a thing.
---
Man, so much stuff running through my head while reading this then overjoyed when I got to the end. Next level stuff there
---
What came first, this post, or the one on r/dota2? Unless this is just new copypasta meta.
---
Come to Wormhole Space.
---
This sounds like they bugged it on patch day and a ticket is the right course of action. The site was working fine a couple of days ago.
---
&gt; make an NPC station your home
---
surely a decent CEO could negotiate access list rights to one of the local citadels? 
---
He is Turd, G-Man II.   
---
 Papa Turd left little G-Man Jr. and mama Turd when he was just a little bowel movement. Mama Turd left him eventually too. It's been a tough run, many twists, turns and stoppages. But as he's aged he has grown stronger, become a solid mass Papa Turd would be proud of if he could see Jr. today.  
---
 
---
Soon /u/G-man_Turd will see the light, break free of his old life and dive head first into his next life chapter.  
---
I wish him luck in his future endeavours.
---
What a moving story!
---
Good corps haven't been affected by the change. They either own customs offices and/or structures or have very short term plans to acquire them. 
---
A lot of those corps exist in high. 
---
It's because you can't bubble, then jump through and bubble again if you got aggro. So pretty much dictors would only last 1 bubble, and you'd need two to bubble both sides. It was limiting a lot of gameplay. Then once it was removed, cdictors became too op in station games, so they've changed it such that if you dock your bubbles die
---
in the grand scheme of things, but not for an alpha running l3s
---
If only there would be a tool to check that yourself.

Can you deliver it to me? My son is dying of autism aids and I already told him he could have it.
---
I made it six years. Final straw was two years ago coaching my youngest son's summer league. Parents from another school looked up my score keeper and harassed her on Facebook over a disagreement they were wrong about in the first place and was a minor correction. This was 5 and 6 year olds. I loved it, but I just couldn't take another season. Some people are just horrible and destroyed something my son and I loved. It's already physically exhausting and a massive amount of physical energy (as well as financial) and that season wiped me out mentally. Had to walk away. 
---
“the csm is sewious business guise!!”

“thats why i shitpost on reddit about it hehe 😎😎”
---
The Lifetime movie is due out Fall 2019. I can't wait tbh.
---
why would a good CEO have plans to acquire structures? doesnt seem like a good idea with current war dec mechanics. seems rather like a way to take donations from members to scam them.
---
IMHO a good CEO should be negotiating access rights and low tax rates with existing structure owners in their systems of operations.
---
I feel looking over this thread at a glance and god..the need to pass on this advice to you /u/deltaxi65
---
"..Never listen to your fans, they never want change. Never listen to your critics, all they want is change. Listen to the undecided, as they are unsure about change.."
---
You doing a race to the bottom reddit town hall meeting atm, is just flipping the undecided to either side for the wrong reason.
---
Done
---
No, only during the anchoring process
---
ya remember when it was so important to add aggro to dropping bubbles that was literally a game saver
---
wait they removed it after adding that stupid fucking change
---
I totally get that - which is why I think it's more interesting to have to decide to sacrifice your bubbler or hope they can maybe get away far enough to cloak up if you want to defensively bubble. Just because one line of gameplay is changed doesn't mean it doesn't open up other also interesting options.
---
It's especially funny to me as a hictor bubble takes aggression but nobody complains about them. If anything I'd expect the more expensive ship to not take aggression.
---
"Please Laugh" - Jeb Ruble, 2019
---
this is literally not a change that is needed to mjd dessies
---
the problem is being able to chain an infinite number of booshers constantly with no drawback
---
You might regret it. A lot of people come back after a year or so.
---
Well played sir, well played...
---
And now - home station has issues when am docked.  
---
I'm glad they added that tbh.
---
Who are you, why do you think people actually care and why are you trying so badly to be in the spotlight?
---
You literally all those things in 1v1- outwitting opponents etc
---
I bet. Any clues as to which mods? Also, keep up the good work. You guys are 100% the reason I started getting really interested in eve again.
---
Nah, sorry, I'm from EU and it has nothing to do with it
---
Trying to jump people off gates and forcing them to either accept the jump and fight or get aggression so you could split their forces on the other side of the gate was a very useful feature as a small gang player, and I will miss it.
---
Not sure what they're trying to do with this change, any small gang or large fleet usage of Command Dessies will continue as before because combat timers don't make a difference in those scenarios. This just hurts the ability of underdogs trying to force a fight with the risk-averse.
---
Do you even know what you are saying or are you this stupid and dumb on a daily basis?
---
I am your mirror, so you tell me, dumbass spotlight seeker
---
I'm sorry you aren't able to laugh a little, like everybody else is.

It's a focus group in a video game. Nobody thinks its serious, dude.

Is your corp looking for players? If not, can you suggest any similar ones that are PvP orientated and worth checking out? Cheers. 
---
Also even t1 jams have insane jam strength so you can try jam the entire logi wing then any damage will slowly whittle through them (cruise vs bs btw). Alternatively if they use scimis, scythes, exeqs, oneiros’ or any form of remote rep (domis etc) then neuts will absolutely obliterate them. Rr logi will have no issue against heavy neuts (osprey, basilisk, augoror or guardian)
---
Yeah. Hisec is good to stage out of, not to live in.
---
As a former SMA pilot, this nomination could not be any more correct if truth itself were words and the post formed itself spontaneously.
---
Sabres are up there
---
Quick, invite him to the pwn_zone!
---
Maybe you should've paid attention to your dscan  at least once as you fought. bait T1's are a thing. As are pirates in lowsec that hunt FW pilots, and anyone else. They're not out to grief YOU. They're out to grief anyone. And grief isn't really accurate either. These guys get their rocks off on fighting as much as you. A lot of the times, they're just smarter, better, and more experienced than you.   
---
Note: If you can fly T1, you can also most likely fly Fleet Issues. Go get yourself a Comet, learn how to Scram Kite, OH properly, and assess Dscan, and go hunt for fights. You'll thank me later.

Don't raitarus get the retardedly strong standup ECM mods?

If they bring just 2 logi ships they will have 0 effective logi because you get 100% jam chance on both.

What if you are a solo camping dictor? Hictor is a different kind of vessel. It's not dropping probes. 
---
'Bug'? Hmm

its a tough lesson, but if they are not rigged you can fix them with just another timer or two.

Matias was the best, i still remember responding to him spamming his corp advert in Duripant.

LOL, sorry bro. Wish you were hanging with us.

Nope
---
k
---
What'd I miss? D:
---
LOL Great play. When I was CSM, I got a lot of shit and they didnt invite me to the sacred "CCP CSM SKYPE".  So after asshatting in the CSM forums, I posted "Notes on my resignation" they removed my access etc and I got back to them saying that never in the post DID I RESIGN, I only talked about my resignation. They were mad :D
---
so why the hate??? or you just trying to be a reddit warrior? seems like you are not happy where you at....and do you kiss your mom with that mouth?? lol
---
I truly admire people that can write a long post expressing their thoughts and presenting their views on a subject to completion, i just lose interest halfway through. 
---
Maybe it's a language thing, as it takes me a little more time than the average native individual to find the correct way to translate and express my thoughts, or maybe it's a medical thing, although where i currently reside "ADD" is not recognized and if a parent is concerned about their child's attention span they get advised to beat them into shape.  
---
But at the same time this subreddit doesn't really encourage well thought-out and structured discussion/conversation, as in most cases you run the risk ( "risk", more like 90% of cases, but what's the word for that ? language thing again and i'm starting to get annoyed and wondering why i'm typing this ) of spending a decent amount of time trying to get your point accross only to get asinine responses such as "lol retard" and "xd tapi flair".  
---
So why bother, why engage in conversation when you can just call someone an autist that doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about and end it there, why live, why are we here on earth ?
---
i don't know where i'm going with this i need to wipe my ass and get to work i'm already running late
---
Well said Lasker!
---
Not a bad message, just the wrong audience
---
We dunking on Pamfam up north now boyo!
---
or they scram you with a timer @0 on a gate so you die
---
what is wrong with that
---
this is why they did it, they couldn't fix the bug so they removed it
---
Another nerf to nano. Le sigh
---
Yes...I understood in advance posting something along those lines on an eve online message board might be hazardous for my ‘statistics’ but I still felt it couldn’t hurt to mention it. Someone may actually learn something new.
---
It was on the csgo sub like 3 weeks ago

That's hilarious.

I think neutral logi is an awful mechanic in high sec.
---
If wars are to be taken seriously, you need to be able to identify and kill all healer classes. 
---
Has this been remarked on by CCP at all re: high sec mechanics?
---
Ffs, how dare you make me feel my own tears! 
---
Yeah, fuck that, me too, this is great. 
---
That's only in highsec

Damn son.

Welp. And then they say /r/eve is a negative place.

Its the sub that's wholesome :)))
---
CSM don’t have any “qualifications” besides playing the game.
---
so, Brisc is actually one of the more qualified CSM we have currently.
---
Idk I think that still goes to TAPI claiming to be a strong independent alliance.

People's Diplo!  Why are we not at war with the horrible RPers of Provi?

This is not dscan...

In fact, I'm pretty sure that trick only works is you don't leave grid, but I'm not sure.

I haven't played in two years and I have a hand drawn mug from CCP_Falconbut shit if this isn't why I still read this sub.

Wow are you fucking wrong on so many levels.

Have you ever hunted back when you only had KM in as range? When you actually had to use a neuron to figure where someone was?

Finding someone is not tedious, it takes 10s or less.
---
And yet, having also done both jobs myself, I feel like we both probably did more good to the world as Little League coaches.
---
And I'm not in any way disparaging your CSM work when I say that. It's just that being a coach is more important.
---
You should do your research a bit more careful. 
---
I can't see how that would work. The server needs to send the clients where all anoms, and new anoms are isn't it?
---
tbh how much of it do you think is not rmt'd yet?
---
As /u/-Warmeister- correctly states, it's a n+1 concern. With bubble aggression, a small gang has to either sacrifice DPS to bring more dictors or sacrifice dictors (leaving them cloaked behind enemy lines). Bubble aggression has a chilling effect on small gang play.
---
why would you not have a jumpclone in highsec 
---
Corp tax rate is 8%, friendly fire is on, they have a couple of wardecs but I haven't noticed any enemies.

And even if we could have well thought-out conversations, for what reason ? to convince a a stranger that our idea concerning an obscure game mechanic in a dying obscure internet spaceship game is correct ? what for ?  
---
We don't even get a cookie out of it.  
---
You're far older and wiser than me, Brisc, tell me, what the fuck is the point of living.
---
Indeed. Any mechanic that subjects another player to an unwanted effect should count as aggression in EVE. Aggressive bumping should cause aggression if there was a way in the game's mechanics to recognize aggressive bumping from accidental bumping.

nah definitely horde after their failed attempt to evict darkness by letting elo run their alliance for them yet still telling everyone how they were doing it themselves.

I'm not sure if we correctly understood eachother, but I think you mean that automatic refreshing of distance in probe scan window brings additional load on servers CPUs.

In that case - it would not, game client have full information about positions of signatures (or their approximate locations, before you scanned them down) and anomalies. This change just made it so distances in PROBE SCAN window update automatically.

Knowing where they are doesn’t matter if you can’t make it to them. If ratters paid closer attention to their client you don’t have a chance to catch them. Undocking should have inherent risk.

He left because CCP made it possible to collect market taxes in citadels. Basically he said that they would amass wealth in the hands of a few individuals that will rule the game.

He was right.

are you sure the issues are with the station?

Pretty big pain to do this every time you log in though, to prevent INCOMPATIBLE BUILD with no warning.

That doesn't contradict what I said. He has said both things. Look at his post history here (u/Gevlon), and see how he's still super triggered at Falcon calling him 'mad as a box of frogs'.

Me and Brisc brought it up just now to CCP Rise and it was an intentional change to prevent some weird behavior and pseudo-exploits with them such as being since able to dock with the spool active as one example. 
---
I would say SUDCO/ARCLI eviction of WHBOO farmhole. Several of our guys accidentally put POS password to shipname. WHBOO quickly noticed this and repossessed our spacebound assets. We packed our shit (that was still there) and sold our newly anchored Astrahus to WHBOO.
---
Every time WHBOO finds us, they rename their ships to our previous POS password.
---
I even made a [feelgood](https://imgur.com/a/S4LSbsw) propaganda piece out of it. Come to think of it, I don't think I've posted it to WHBOO public channel yet.

logoff traps
---
Alts renting out industry slots to indy players for 0.01 isk. Alt count only limited by autism level. Every sp farm, pi char, bot vni, every afk rorq, every mission puller, cyno alt and fw farmer would provide industry slots. I think this would not be good as it would increase output of big industrialists and make profit margins for the little beginner indy players even smaller.
---
And what would one achieve with this? Spool up, dock up, undock and instantly "jump" or what? Only "abuse" I can imagine here is booshing people off of undock with pretty much no delay but is this such a big deal? And if so, why not change it in a different way? 
---
How do I execute log off traps at a combat anonaly or a gunned pos?

For a moment I thought you can soon purchase skills and not skillbooks remotely and inject them for plex - next level skill injector p2w shit. :D

Okay, Stannis

no fucking clue about the pos

for anoms just drop an anchorable bubble, logoff
---
haha brilliant, best thing ive read on r/Eve in a long time
---
That's a sore point about dictor survivability, there have been 3 different aggression timers with bubbles over the years and this one seems to be the best.
---
When I started playing it used to not give you an aggression timer unless someone tried to Warp inside your bubble, then it would. Was annoying when random idiots in your fleet would Warp in your bubbles giving you a timer,  it was also weird because you could still drop a bubble during the gate jump animation before you jumped but while you were invul so you could still drop bubbles and trap people getting aggro. But if they held on the side you bubbled you would need to be smart and wait for just before you bubble expires to come back because smart gangs would spam Warp in your bubble which would give you an aggro timer if you were in the same system. This was obviously really complicated so they changed it to always give aggro on launch sometime after, I think with the new crime watch?
---
The aggro on bubble was really terrible for dictor survivability and made trapping fleets much harder, but the real reason why it was changed was it made defensive bubbles while you were trying to cover your fleet fleeing from a bigger or unengagable fleet make the dictor have to suicide or stay behind with an aggro timer, which is pretty bad gameplay for a really niche ship which is often a flying coffin already. 
---
And I believe they changed to the current system with the dictor rebalance around rubicon. There has been some tweaks like bubble disappearing when you dock to help combat some bad gameplay with them. I honestly think the way it was when I played was probably the best mechanically but it was also really complicated and difficult to learn and understand for new players with weird aggression rules. 
---
wtf why

Lack of PayPal option is probably because Evesterdam team does not want people to withdraw their payments.

does it? 
---
Fuck 
---
To be fair in most of the cases you listed above would already be in alt corps doing the manufacturing themselves using Corp hangars and wallets. 
---
Work out where his pos is and the anom that he'll go back to when you leave system. Logoff a sabre in between the two. Login and bubble up. Alternatively put an anchorable bubble down and logoff. Which works depend on how quickly the bot enters warp and/or if the bot dscans before it warps back to the pos. you login which causes him to warp to the pos and get caught. 
---
Even though i am not really the type to write to CSM ppl or participating in "how to improve things ... townhalls here and there" and most of the time not completely reading the results of the meetings you guys take place in, i am sure that it is alot of work and time you have to commit to.
---
So i absolutely appreciate what you're doing there, even though you're Init and i am a wormholer :P . And when i red your post here, i was really sad at first, thinking another good CSM representative quits the job, beeing super happy that i just got fooled when i red the last part :D

Keep up the good work and don't listen to those (or at least don't take them too serious) who only critizise without beeing constructive in their critizism. :)

The trial was given an unlimited time limit.

It's still a subscription game. There's a bunch of stuff you simply won't be able to do, and a bunch more you won't be able to do well with an alpha account.

That said, considering you're paying 0 there's plenty you can do, and do well enough, to enjoy the game and get involved in all the fun.
---
You could say that you're full of shit and can't back up your claims with any credible evidence whatsoever.
---
This definitely made me ignore more than a few wormholes today while bookmarking them. "ok, i just warped to the second one in the list, ill just ignore that one... huh, this other ones on grid with me... wtf?"
---
Epic post 
---
warp sabre to dragspot on pos -&gt; log off?
---
but if it actually is a bot, he will be in warp to pos way before you landed with your sabre and bubbled up.
---
do you know his cooldown? does he warp to the same anom he just got spooked? -&gt; wait next door, wait out cooldown, warp to anom and pray that hes just landing.
---
if that doesnt work, you either need blue eyes or put a cloaky toon in there and pray that hell get whitelisted. keep sabres next door and jump them in as soon as he warps to a new anom.
---
*sigh*
---
pointless
---
No, but it know where all anoms in current system are. And where scanned signatures are. And approximate locations of unscanned signatures. This update don't changes much.
---
can you convince him in a calm and collected way that this change is unnecessary?
---
if that fails, fling proverbial monkey poo and make ten thousand complaint threads on reddit; if history is any indicator then that should work.
---
because boosh is one syllable, and mjfg is not
---
Can't say I've ever seen any exploits or shenanigans that game-breaking to warrant this change.
---
Fuck Brisc!  think about my heart, i am a old fart in space :P
---
Sometimes you're trying to force them to aggress you so as to split their defense forces on each side of the gate. 
---
It was a very useful grid control mechanism for small gang and solo.
---
My point is that just because dictors work one way now doesn't mean they have to work that way in the future. As long as they provide utility (they still would in a lot of circumstances) it'd just mean you'd need to be a bit more committed when you hit that button.
---
observe where he goes
---
logoff sabre there then login, bubble and hope he lands there
---

http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/
---
This is two things. 
---
1) it is the defacto primary resource for almost all general eve knowledge as the official wiki for the game
---
2) it is the wiki for Eve University, which is a really amazing group for helping new players get on their feet in eve
---
I recommend using google to search the eve uni wiki when you need help, by adding "site:wiki.eveuniversity.org" to your search. I also recommend applying to the eve university, but there's many other good groups out there for new players which you will do equally well in. 
---
I'm afraid we aren't as we are just a tight knit group of close friends. 
---
There aren't a huge amount of c2 nanogang corps but just from memory: fight the blob, the tuskers, the Kronos ritual, hydra and out of focus. There's also a new one that just started up but I can't remember the name. Joining in game channels like Microgang Help and discords like praiseBob might help. A small google or post on evejobs may turn up more nanogang corps. 
---
Thera route would be Volta or other therabois. 
---
Other wormhole groups could also be a good fit but the action would often be less reliable. 
---
[Nam\_Dnilb](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nam_Dnilb) is right, dont get fooled by this animation. As you are just doing hack the first can on the left, then burn to the remote sentry repair unit. Zoom out because the explosion effect will litteraly melt your eyes (i have lost 3 sets of retinas so far). Hack it and let it repaire the blue sentry.
---
As a small advice, I usualy start with this room. While the blue sentry cleans the sentry room you can go to the solar room and do it. it saves time and time is money
---
F2p for small ship, there are lots to do. Don't rush to omega, till you know this game is for you.
---
Join a Corp is super important. I always recommend join a null sec Corp like pandemic hoard(test, goons,brave also good choices). Apply, then do your tutorial. When you are accepted they give like 100 free ships and all the skil books you may need for the first 40 days.
---
Fly on as many fleets with your Corp as possible, find out if you like solo or gang PvP or many other types of game play. After a month or two you will May  move to a smaller Corp  that specialises in your favourite game play.
---
And people would theorycraft the shit out of it on singularity.
---
People used to use "jump" to cover MJDs as well. However since using that words while in big fleets usually triggers some pleb to do something stoopid, something else was needed. No idea who, where or when tho.

A little salt is good for you.

If a player tries to warp in it or lands in it with the Sabre still in system, yes. Otherwise, no.

Welcome to Eve.
---
The best advice I can give is that you should join faction warfare and make some friends. There's 'npc' fw corps, and that's the place to start. You'll make isk, shoot others (and importantly learn not to fear getting shot at yourself), and make friends.

The term "boosh" originates from the very first shout a player learns in Skyrim.

Even the player base forgets alot of things. Most won't remember the changing of Yulai highway for example all because 100 players caused huge server lag using it as a hub (Yulai was a far far better hub than Jita by a country mile). T20, Boot.ini, greed is good, Remote DD's, Nos changes, nano changes, mining with battleships (even though that has made a comeback thanks to alpha changes). Tonnes of changes over the last 15-16yrs.
---
I would honestly recommend to NOT join a null sec Corp like mentioned above right away. You will get trained to be a F1 monkey from the very start and might get a wrong impression of the game. Better if you find a small but active group that guides you through all different ways of playing eve, not only large scale 0.0 warfare. Once you know what you like to do, and think that 0.0 warfare is for you, then those groups are the right spot to start out doing this

Sadly that barely works against bot. The moment you log in and appear in local, the bot will activate warp to his POS or Station. Because of that, even if he hasn´t entered warp yet, he will just ignore the bubble and warp through it, as a bubble only works if it was already up before warp got initiated.   
---
Only way to hold them is when you have logged off in the site itself, and land in reach to bubble the ship itself before it warps away  
---
even then he would have to relog

Wow. We have reached a new level bois. Congratulations.

This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
If you want to spend a extra month earning low level skill books and ships, then this is a great idea.

Gotta say another noob Who feeds The goons

When do People see if The keep join one alliance They Will endt up killing The content at The endt when you have one side Who can stram role All other?

 Open your eyes or this game ends like on The chanise server All red to one grup in 00 space an No fight left becouse They cant resist Any attack..

Is That The future you Guys want for Eve???

I'll just point out there's a whole recruitment subreddit in /r/evejobs

If that happens,gamers or even CCP will do something,for example by accident delete goonswarm federation(joke)

The reason I ask is given the blingy nature of some of the pods, I want to ransom them if the system allows for it. ;)

It would be confusing as fuck that´s for sure.

Would be a good idea to stop sneaking stuff past changelogs
---
Why do people think 0.0 groups only do bloc warfare? There are many proficient solo pvpers and small gang FCs in every newbie alliance who will take people under their wing and guide them.
---
Joining a 0.0 group doesn't turn you into an F1 monkey unless that's all you can aspire to be.
---
Big alliances like PH also offer newbie starter packs with skillbooks, prefit ships, skill plans, guides on a multitude of topics, and ample pvp opportunities at all scales to hone your skills with. 
---
This should be their in game ship class name, love it. 
---
As others wrote - the Gila BPC can drop in Gurista DED sites, best chances are in 5/10 and 6/10.
---
If you want to run Gurista missions, but your standing is deeply negative: If you have a second Omega account, you can get around the extremely long and painful standing grind with Lvl 1 missions: Take a char from the second account, which doesn't have ruined standings. He doesn not need any combat skills. It helps if he can fly a travelceptor or covert ops frig, it helps if he has some social skills (social, criminal connections).
---
Make a fleet of your main and the alt. The alt accepts the missions, and fleet warps your main to the location, then returns to the agent. Your main runs the mission, the alt then turns it in and gets money and LPs.
---
You will be asked if you want to share the reward, this also shares the agent and corp standing gain. Say no until your alt can take lvl 4 missions. After that, you can share if you want to get standing for your main, too. But that's only sensible if the faction standing is still above -2.0, because if you are below that, corp and agent standings are not useful any more.

Hey guys!   
---
EVE Vegas was more thought of as a dance partner for Fanfest. On the other side of the Atlantic, covering the other half of the year. This year everything is different of course but to explain it a little better (and there will be a lot more info coming in the next few  weeks) you can think of these events as hybrids between the large player run events they're based on, and CCP official events.  
---
CCP will bring a bigger budget, resources and content and we're working closely with the local player organizers to offer the kind of official content you'd expect from a CCP event while retaining the local flavor and event culture in many ways :). One of our hopes is to tighten our relationship with the event organizer community and strengthen it through this series.  
---
This is also very much a cohesive series of events where content will run throughout and, with us in charge of ticket sales and attendance tracking for the events, we can better reach out to everyone, create interesting contests between events etc.  
---
Look forward to revealing more. Let me know if you have more questions.
---
oof
---
You miss 100% of the chances you dont take, so keep trying.
---
You are having a rough week.
---
So to "fix" this the whole aggression timer had to be added? Sounds like band-aiding instead of bug fixing to me. That being said, is it that much of a problem? 
---
This is a very early br [https://zkillboard.com/related/30002435/201901161000/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30002435/201901161000/)
---
Good fight. I atleast got on some kills instead of getting zero and waiting 6 hrs for ualx. 
---
This is a malicious lie. A source, who chooses to remain anonymous, and is familiar with TEST thinking, has reported this is a fundraising operation for orphans in the Geminate region.
---
That's a pretty rough trade (230-odd dreads and 16 carriers for 59-odd FAX), but looks hairy as fuck. 
---
Why the fuck am I stuck at work fffffffffffff.
---
It's one of those big oofs, the one you feel coming all week.  When it finally gets here, people hear it for miles.  Not in a real audible way, just that feeling.  The oof.

Just wait til the TAPI deployment officially starts on Saturday

AAR: Test, Goonswarm, Init and Snuff try and dreadbomb Horde supercarriers. All of Panfam super fleet is on log in screens, logs in and goes DDs free.  Tapirium cap fleet eats shit.  
---
PGL once again outwitted by Steadyo.
---
Damn blue donut ate shit
---
wormholer btw
---
Glad that you guys should show us how to dread bomb after we tried at D-G gf
---
Why the fuck would anyone dread bomb under the nose of someone super fleet.
---
So you admit both being an asshole and a grammar nazi ?
---
Thats greatness
---
Of course, getting every last drop of ISK from someone you dominated in a fair fight is right in my opinion ^^
---
However, it could play against you by being too greedy and not checking the timer... Plus, I think the only way of talking in the abyss is either corporation chats, or private messages.
---
Its like a big ooofff that gives you splash back on yer butt. 
---
Was it just me or was there very little tidi for the majority of that fight ?
---
I had the node reinforced
---
Test lost a day of high sec market income, Goons lost a few delve time units

Damn blue donut shooting that blue donut.

It was fucking intense, god damn. We (Horde subs) were light on logi going in but we caught lots of purples for a long-ass time until you primaried your way through us there at the end.
---
GF.

PL/NC+Horde is much smaller blue donut than Goons+TAPI+Snuff
---
MJD is still more than one syllable. Em-Jay-Dee vs boosh
---
This fight will give PGL the last piece of the puzzle on how to beat enemy super fleets.
---
Well that makes it allright then.
---
thats a nice dreadnought fleet,  pity if something was to happen to it
---
Good question which I'm glad I can address. We will indeed have dank reveals at Amsterdam but that doesn't mean we'll spill all the beans at once or that the other events won't have surprises in store. All these events will have ongoing news of what's coming for EVE along with all kinds of different official content and social happenings that we hope you'll all enjoy :)  
---
Let's take Toronto and Sydney as examples since they're next in line, they'll be multi-day conference type events by day with hands on EVE activities, roundtables, talks by players and devs and pub crawls and parties at night. St. Petersburg is a one day event so while it will have the same kind of content, it'll just be a little shorter. Most if not all events will have an official live stream as well.  
---
Full event tickets will typically give you access to all daytime activities and the main party, but for some events we'll add some extra events and sell tickets separately, similar to what we do around Fanfest and EVE Vegas. More info on all this soon :)
---
Not a bad start to the day.

Skill urself

shooted our jump bridge even tho i told them not to!
---
This change is...meh I guess. Just prevents you from riskless station booshing and the amazing boosh to bubbled gate at 0 meme.
---
if they actually wanted to nerf chain booshing they should make it so that getting booshed while your MJFG is on cooldown extends your MJFG cooldown. Still allowing spearfishing, but preventing eternal chain booshing ala frog fleet/jump Ravens.
---
Yeah yeah already replaced , grow up , loss is loss , even tapi and goons can’t replace half a trillion every day ..
---
That removes spearfishing which is a great combat tool and tactic for fighting outnumbered.
---
The real problem occurs in tidi fests when you can't probe mjd fleets before they spool again.
---
32b to 67b in losses is not even close to the actual numbers
---
I think the winning strategy is to kill them until they are dead, preferably with a larger force than their own. Am I correct here mister raknor bile?

No but it still isn't much of a dent.
---
Sure goon and test can replace their capital fleet but where is the pleasure of throwing capital ships for nothing? It's not the first time. At one point it's mostly morality that is affected 
---
Show me the ticket made by the bot user how I blackmailed him and I gladly take my ban.

I think PL was the closest to success by almost being able to kill some random rak instead of the target molok. almost.

See you when your invasion officially starts this coming weekend! 
---
GF!
---
Not really. Many players, like you, wants to be "part of something big" or, like i believe, be part of a potential "winning" side. In their side, CCP have their hands tied because, if the major part of players are part of a big bloc, their clients are too. So, CCP doesn't want to fuck their clients, they are who are paying the bills and profits.
---
This is a players work, join to an alliance that really needs you, if you don't like that alliance, join another. But not join to the bigger alliance: they don't need you for something else to avoid you to join in alliance that in future will can front them in battle in terms of numbers. I see this in my relative few time in Eve: Goons rarely engage without big number superiority, they know they can form more people than everyone, maybe not today, but tomorrow. Meanwhile, they run to a citadel/station and dock up.
---
And with this, i don't want to say: "don't join goons because i don't like goons", actually i haven't nothing against goons personally, but is a fact that they (and their coalition and friend coalitions) have a extreme number superiority, a fact that in future can carry to the game to the "Serenity scenario" and fuck it up. Content in Eve borns from conflict, if you remove the conflict, you remove the content.
---
I've been playing for more than 2 years and I have yet to see a single one working.

Dreadbombs don't work, more news at 11.

cynos and static connections make a huuuuge difference to gameplay mechanics and pay hand in hand with the intel local provides. If you can't wrap your head around that and think about why small gangs have it harder without local i can't help you

I'm confused. I was always under the impression horde was very disorganised, accepts anyone etc. Are they more organised than I thought or is this a new thing or are they accepting anyone but secretly competent? Genuine question sorry

Wrong. It didn't work this time.

The fax wall is

Originally it was just called MJDing when it was a BS module; as far as I recall it stated getting called booshing when command destroyers were introduced.

the d-w dreadbomb worked because it was in their staging system and they drag bubbled the pos grid and also all of the gates

also op did say "against a non shit group"
---
Horde has a cool culture, so when people get better at the game they stay instead of leaving.

Trash FC steadyo wins again

Horde Vanguard is their 'closed group' with tokens required back ground checks on your extended family etc. Horde proper is open to all new/homeless pilots who are PVP&gt;KRAB inclined. 
---
Circa 67 Titans + 47 Supercarriers fielded for panfam.it’s fair to say that defanging any big powerbloc’s supercapital umbrella is going to lead to mutually assured destruction on an epic scale. So the question is going to come down to who is most prepared to risk their SC umbrella fleet most to take ground or defend it, and whose SRP warchest is deep enough to persuade the SC carebears to field their ratting toys on front line combat. Clearly without SC coverage meatshieldimg dreads is going to get very expensive when facing a full superpower volley of dd’s. My mind is blown, when I left 3 years ago Horde didn’t Have a single Titan and now they are putting up fleets of them bigger than the ferox fleets in ‘16. 
---
You were fighting scourge, thats sorta expected you would lose. Scourge = good at eve. You arnt shitters for welping to them.

Wormholes are fairly balanced tbh at least in my experience from a while ago. Maybe give it a go?
---
I'm not saying balance of supers and titans isn't fucked btw and I'd make drastic changes to the game if I could but ultimately that isn't going to happen so you have to be realistic

Horde accepts anyone, but is still very well organized.

I've spent time in wormhole space, and it's not really the kind of place I like to live in. The rest of Eve is more my forte, but FAX-repped supers are really sucking the life out of it.

He's got some skills not strictly needed for Nyx, i.e. he can fly Minmatar carriers too.  He's got some drone skills also as I'm never sure which drone skills actually affect fighters (apparently they don't but then I read somewhere else some of them do, etc. at least as prereqs).  Then there are things like biology, rigging skills, etc. + the ability to fly interceptors, etc.  It all adds up.

Enter the ore prices in your region and then start looking for blueprints that are most profitable. Once  you have identified the best 10 or so, look at their trade volumes in the market and compare it with the amount of competitor sellers you have. Take the best 2 or 3 of that and start  making those. 
---
That said,  I am not sure if you will make good money in highsec making t1 things as an alpha. What I would suggest is:
---
*  Build up some isk capital, if you can get to 1.5bil or so that should be enough to get started.  
---
* Train your reaction skills up so you can have 10 slots (its about a 1 week train, not sure how far you can train it on alpha) 
---
* Go back to the website, tick "build own components" and find good T2 modules. 
---
* Buy raw moon goo with your isk and start building. Your profit margins will be much higher.
---
You can use your other character slots for reaction alts too, you can also start investing into original blueprints of popular ships, research them then sell copies as extra isk while you sleep.
---
lol
---
Horde started as an alliance for new players, but lots of the new players decided to stay after gaining more experience. Now we have some pretty decent fcs and also linemembers. Horde still accepts everyone and so far it hasnt caused any big problems. I don't know how disorganized things are compared to other alliances, but at least leadership of horde is very active. 
---
Someone who has been in horde longer than me can probably give some better insight on the history and evolution of this great alliance. 
---
Just remove EHE from Faxes and give it it's original duration back for Dreads.

You, generally speaking, are a shitty person and you probably smell terrible.

There is only one alliance=&gt;less and less players play eve=&gt;CCP can not afford another big server for Jita=&gt;they do something to return players(for example new PvE content)
---
i think test got to see first hand experience how well dreads do vs superblop, yet here we are
---
Yes I agree. I think the issue comes down to isk. Just my 2 isk but changes I would make are: 
---
Remove panic modules.
---
Make cynos have a spool up time.
---
Remove asset safety.
---
Remove reinforcement timer for low power citadels.
---
I mean you aren't technically wrong that TZ tanking is winning. But GoTG got thrashed in every BR that ever showed up around here regardless of who ended up with the sov.
---
Good match up, ..good thing we only had a trash FC or this would have been really rough. 
---
I've heard people in wormholes saying boosh since basically day one. Not sure who started it though. I'd assume someone on a podcast or stream said it since it was so widespread, so immediately.

Taking sov away from someone who already don't want to fight is not a way to generate content. That is what i think.

The Abyssal new content didn't catch new players. Eve is presented like a player-run game, not a PvE based one. I think CCP can't do something relevant about this. This is a player's job, for better and worse.
---
Yeah. The majority of us are meatshield cannon fodder, Vanguard actually play the game.
---
But even cannon fodder can get the job done when you throw enough of us at a problem :D
---
FAX is the issue here, not supers and titans
---
&gt; did you graduate
---
Bold statement
---
Let us know where and when and I'll come just for fun (if it's in a TZ that works for me)
---
credit where it's due, respect for trying to make a play
---
What did I say that was wrong?
---
Main reason is I can't afford both.  I mean I'll have to wait a year or so to be able to afford the Avatar.  After the last war I decided I'd never deploy a Super again so... it's just a ratting character/suitcase right now.
---
Of course we never know if CCP will introduce changes that'll make using it compelling so I can't decide whether to extract it or not. 
---
dang that must blow....getting dunked by a trash FC :o
---
l o l
---
hmm so it worked because there was planning? still a dread bomb tho :P
---
Just pointing out that it's not just a TEST invasion, I like how me being CENTI directly invalidates my argument.
---
Right, so the new copypasta. I've been seeing this go around, didn't know where it came from. 
---
This is a good post. 
---
Show us on the BR where the titan touched your dread https://zkillboard.com/related/30002435/201901161000/
---
I remember.
---
Ah ok - awesome!! Thanks for the clarification :D 
---
Someone said gotg is dead, so we just went off with the meme. Much better than ripping off Marvel IP.
---
you miss 100% of the shots you dont take.
---
I spent almost 2 years in goons just krabbing and doing f1 blobfests. Became less and less interested in eve over time, just disappearing for months at a time then coming back like "I'll have fun this time!"
---
But I owned caps, and they were in Delve, so I went back to hang with my corp dudes and chill. Lasted about a week before disappearing for another couple months. 
---
This time I didn't reapply, sold all my shit in firesales for about 60% jita buy and fucked off to highsec. Started roaming lowsec in frigates and playing with abyssal deadspace and daytripping in wormholes, having more fun in the past 2-3 months than the past 2 years. Now I'm living in a wormhole with Brave's WH corp (so I guess I do have the option to do nullsec stuff if I really want to, but I haven't actually set foot outside j-space for about 3 weeks).
---
Tl;dr - If you're bored in nullsec, get the fuck out of nullsec. Even if you enjoy the company of your corp, if you're not enjoying what you're doing you're doing yourself a great disservice that will only lead to burnout or quitting altogether. There's plenty of other things to try out!
---
He's a lobbyist.  That means he wasn't good enough to win an election, and he has no morals - he just gives money to politicians.  It's the only thing worse than being a politician, actually. 
---
I believe you can fly the ship until you next dock.
---
If I was worried about my Eve legacy, I'd run for student council and act like I've accomplished something in a video game.  Fun fact, you'll still be worthless in a month.  
---
I'm not sure what Brisc being a bad CSM has to do with hard knocks, but okay. 
---
Do you really have to make a post for 10b worth of kills? Jeez its less than 1 super.
---
Sorry, your son will have to die alone and without a free ship. 
---
Tapirium. Now that is a good meme! 
---
When has it ever worked against a non-shit response? 
---
Everyone just seemed to agree to start saying boosh/ing when command dessies came out. 
---
Makes sense, I guess. At the end of the day its random story to explain a function in the game. Why cant we add to this random story, with another random story?, no one really cares.
---
Dismissing good content solely on a random story that no one 16 years into the game really cares about, is stupid
---
Right in my weak spot, memes. 
---
W-well my donut is smaller therefore I am better! REEEE
---
industry slot skins obviously! make your UI shiny for just $59.99
---
Yeah sure u are in NPC corp. Killmails above and roaming delve is enough evidence.
---
That was possible because it wasn't an active conflict. Goons weren't ready for a big ass ball of dreads. The counter to that much dps is a ball of faxes and they just didn't have that ready to jump.
---
Until they were able to muster a force capable of saving their supers the dreads were able to kill shit.
---
However nowadays in these actual fights, the fax are already on standby so you've got mere seconds before the apostle ball lands. You may get one super in that time, with enough dreads, but pretty soon the reps will be overwhelming. 
---
All that krabbing is doing things to your mind. Stop it!
---
Didnt want those dreads anyway. Geminate campaign starts on saturday btw
---
Do all the career agents, you’ll get about 10 million isk and free ships. Train scanning skills, archeology and hacking. The exploration agent will teach you all you need to know. Go exploring, you’ll earn decent isk, get to learn your way round Eve, how to make bookmarks, safespots, scan for hostile etc. Go and jump in some wormholes and go to null. Stick to a T1 frigate with basic fit and insure it, you’ll make back 10x the cost of your ship or more in one site. Train all your basic skills while you decide what you enjoy doing. Don’t go omega for at least 1-2 months while you figure out if you will keep playing. Once you’ve got competent at flying and have some decent skills then think about what kind of corp you might like - the big null outfits are bodyshops like working at Walmart, smaller corps can often teach you better as you’ll be likely get someone willing to mentor you. Don’t rush into expensive ships, fittings and implants - the most fun in Eve is when you feel like you have literally nothing to lose and can go anywhere without caring. If you get killed in a t1 frigate and naked pod you can shrug it off - if someone feels better for having a 600k isk noob killmail then good for them but honestly you can roam around huge amounts of empty null and wh space and never see another player so my first advice is scan a wormhole down and get out of hisec as soon as you finish the tutorials - the worst thing you can do is become afraid of leaving hisec, the quicker you go and realise it’s not that scary the more likely you are to fly with confidence your whole Eve career,]. And don’t join the F1 blob too quickly, too many nullbears will only fly in a herd in null, being confident solo in low sec, nullsec and wormholes opens up the entire game. Do it when it’s cheap and you’ll never develop a risk adverse mentality and getting used to losing ships quickly stops you becoming too obsessed with not losing things. 
---
That dreambomb was sucesfull because GOTG tards put their faxes in wrong place.
---
talking about that dunk in Detorid? yep lol
---
i think steadyo FC'd their Muninn Fleet and Seddow FC'd the Eagle fleet:
---
TEST Eagle &amp; Kirin fleet losses:
---
Heavy Assault Cruiser	12
---
Logistics Frigate	3	
---
PanFam Muninn Fleet losses:
---
Heavy Assault Cruiser	58	
---
Logistics	10	
---
So yeah, Steadyo (or whoever FC'd the subcaps) lost.
---
Hello sir,
---
Have you head of low class wormhole ?
---
They tz tanked well, but we killed a bunch of their titans and supers
---
things like this make this game worth playing....good job, sir !
---
Overall that'll make game worse since you gonna copypaste more and more. This game needs diversity, not the same stuff but with different label. 
---
Also, that won't make much content as you expect, cause realistically if you want to farm Sansha you go to Stain or sovnull tbh. I haven't seen anyone farming those holes ever.
---
credible source
---
8 titans 15 supers 31 rorquals dead GOTG capitals in less than two months. Killed by blessed Black Legion and 1 Pandemic Horde sig.
---
clearly.  Realized that a week ago but that cat was out of the bag already.
---
its was there dreads jumping in 70km of the fax that was the problem, pilot error 
---
All surviving dreads except one were from Snuff.  Makes you wonder
---
Horde had the most supercaps on grid
---
Take my up vote. 
---
Good move Harvey.
---
Or alternatively remove nullsec pve because they can't fix botting.
---
"Sounds like band-aiding instead of bug fixing to me."
---
Welcome to CCP circa 2010-Present
---
It worked. GF. 
---
aren't bees animals?
---
i mean, yeah? unless he was also FCing the titans lol
---
people stopped watching their subcap main cuz the feed was too good
---
We had steadyo reinforced
---
because most of the sub cap pilots were concentrating on the big toys.  who gives a fuck about the subcaps when the supers are on field
---
HICs are survivable enough to hold grid, whereas sabres entire survivability against a fleet comes from crashing gate perpetually.
---
Yes.
---
Ideal if you want to do this sub/dread method is to clear the site with subs. Shoot the box to spawn the drifter. Let it warp off then probe it down to kill it later.
---
and well countered too, good shit
---
Not really, FAX are ridiculously strong.  Normally it doesn't bother me cos, y'know, I fly them all the time, but they're just too damn good just now.
---
right, i understand that, but was Steadyo FCing the Muninns or was it just a free for all?
---
Just fuck off 
---
Lol ok then.
---
Even a trash FC can feed all his subs but get bailed out by second sub fleet/titan/supers once in awhile ;)
---
Oh yes, Paradise remembers .... good times
---
Tbf while at work today I was thinking that, the smart thing to do would be to try to bait out combined supercaps after we got your rorqual 2 days ago  
---
Got a ping 10 min later saying dreads were being moved and prepped  
---
After that plans were hatched
---
I needed this, not for pvp tho, for explo. :)
---
This is more along the line of fixing botting by removing nullsec pve.
---
It does make you the same as him though when you take his dirty isk. 
---
Son's crying thanks
---
I have transcended the limits of time and space and reached a smugularity.
---
NC and horde subcaps were in entirely separate fleets, to get steds numbers you need to filter nc out.
---
yeah that was the idea, take advantage of the rorqual loss and make it look like we were trying the same thing but with a little more effort.  Obviously yall caught wind of the real plan and it went south from there.
---
Why would XiX pay Snuff attack GotG?
---
Test Alliance Pleasing Imperium
---
Subcaps are where all the skills are.  I'll happily welp 280 dreads if it means I can kill 58 muninns, that just means I'm more elite than you.
---
Best comments in the entire thread
---
staging systems are the notable exception to umbrellas
---
Require Titans to be sieged same as dreads before they can DD with no RR capability in siege, nerf gun DPS &amp; tracking with bonuses on siege. It’s a logical thing that the power for the DD is so big then it should require shutting down propulsion to fire it. If Titans had to self tank then you’d see a much better trade of dreads to titans. Titan nukes a dread with DD, has to eat shit for ten minutes self tanking. That’d also curtail driveby bosuns and ratting blap+go Titans. Supercarriers probably need a switchable offensive/defensive module. If you are offensive you can have fighters out and self rep, if you are defensive you can’t have fighters deployed only range limited drones but can accept remote reps and cap. You can’t have a situation where you;be got stuff like dreads sieged with no reps while other caps can nuke + rep - that’s what’s broken imho. 
---
Yeah but that's not in PH's advantage as all the aggro is heading towards them
---
Skewer
---
Now they are gonna move em. This is kinda what i meant
---
I have another char which can sit in the dread, can it be warped in whilst the subs are looting the field or will that spawn avengers?
---
Will the drifter appear in the same place once you shoot the structure? Just curious if a site can be started and finished on grid, but using just one extra dread to finish it
---
as a capital producer in delve I would like to thank panfam for killing these, I'll be making a bunch of isk off building more
---
Well in 2016 calling Panfam blue donut is fine. Goons were rebuilding. TAPI was more independent, third side in galaxy.
---
In 2018 after Goons won war in Fade/Pure Blind and TAPI having nip with goon for over a year, Goons+TAPI are definitely bigger blue donut right now.
---
LMAO
---
This sounds eminently sensible.
---
Christ
---
I dont think this is it but itd be better if it were just subs on subs. You guys can fuck shit up with subs.
---
Yeah, that more of less would be the case. Setup near a market a couple of jumps from lowsec
---
yeah ok retard
---
I learn something new every day
---
I did, Mittens was the only one to lose The Casino War, due to terrible management and trust issues.
---
Oh the content!!!
---
well played good sir, well played
---
Okay so removing the Northern Coalition Muninns that were killed by TEST &amp; Friends, PanFam sustained the loss of 28 Heavy Assault Cruisers and 8 Logistics ships.
---
Since Northern CoalitionDOT and Pandemic Horde were on different fleets, we can go a step further and say that of the 12 HACs lost by TEST &amp; Friends, 6 were killed by NCdot alone and do not count soooo the final tally is:
---
6 HACs and 3 Logistics Frigates lost by TEST &amp; Friends at the hands of PanFam
---
28 HACs and 8 Logistics Cruisers lost by PanFam (Excluding NCdot) at the hands of TEST &amp; Friends.
---
I was thinking the same thing. Maybe Snuff joined TAPI?
---
Beans are what keep horde rolling, without the beans stuff like this couldn't happen.
---
Sounds about right, as I said somewhere above we kinda just abandoned our subs right after we entered grid. Not sure about horde but consider nc numbers entirely ineffectual.
---
poogers.
---
I suppose either that, or we go home, because clearly, whatever we're trying to do isn't working.
---
I pushed for jiggle for so long.
---
It's a micro jiggle drive. A drive that jiggles. 
---
"basically" "on their own"
---
It will spawn avengers. If you really want to solo dread, run strongholds. You can 4 cycle them (which includes the drifter) if you play your cards right. Faster than anything except 4+ tinker snakes (at which point you're probably better off running multiple sites simultaneously anyway).
---
Test has a strong will. I dont think itll end
---
So when does the campaign start?
---
I'm glad you're not in charge of balance jesus
---
pepega
---
The "join a corp" narrative needs to die a bit. Solo/small gang are much better for the health of the game as they lower the barrier to entry for other players wanting to do just that. Its also far more rewarding to kill something when there is an actual risk.
---
Word. I mean, it makes sense to focus on your supercapitals on grid, but from your vantage point did anyone continue FCing or calling targets/anchoring on the PanFam side or did all subs just kinda warp away? That's what I am getting at.
---
20 minutes I've been wait for the break to end!! WTF is this shit!
---
why would I not fly a scramkite magus solo and never ever die? they would never have to commit to an engagement
---
I need to know what drink!!!!!
---
I just read Tapir. Whats goin on lol
---
oh I'm definitely using that one
---
Check out Odin's Call. C2&gt;C5/NS wh corp and they are recruiting.
---
Honestly? Sub fc died, secondary fc died, I was oh shit logi anchor and I was too busy to notice my cap buddies died until I was poked in comms let alone try to anchor the logi wing. So honestly I think we just floated in space and died.
---
american healthcare working as intended - social darvinism turned into actual darvinism
---
Yes, even after the rats are dead, if the site is still spawned you will spawn the Avengers (even if there are no more waves). I tested this myself a couple months ago with a corp mate when I still lived in a C5. If you really want to put your dread in the site after all the rats are gone, you can leave a single sub in the site aligned out, warp your dread, and right as the dread loads grid, poke the drifter can and warp out. The avengers will spawn as the dread is landing (somewhere right as the dread loads grid). Then, you prime the Avengers and then kill the drifter. A decently fitted dread can tank all of the above without much trouble (watched even a rev do it so a nag would be even better). 
---
If you clear the site with subs, the best way to do this though is to loot the field, scoop up your MTU, depot, and warp off all toons but one. Then poke the drifter and warp your last toon off. After a few seconds, the drifter will warp to a celestial and then you bring your dread in and kill it there. Then you save time by not having to kill Avengers which kills efficiency. If you have enough toons, you leave a second cloaked one in the site to see where the drifter goes or you can just dscan him down almost just as fast (he'll just go to a planet or wh). Warp your dread to the drifter and there you can very easily solo him or if you have a vigilant or dram on an alt, you can bring one in to apply tackle and basically throw your keyboard out the window and go afk.
---
I have done the same thing. Now im in aridia and had more Fun in 3 weeks Then i had in 1.5 years in nullsec where you are just a number
---
Irony                                                                              you

---
The _whole point_ of a launcher is to keep the game updated automatically.  Literally every other game with a launcher in existence does this, yet CCP fails somehow.
---
I'd love to have some nice statistics afterwards, knowing about how the events went. Like a comparison of how many ppl maybe went to the player based ones, and how many came this year.
---
Also where ppl were coming from. I recall, that you had some of those statistics like a couple years ago, seeing that there are a couple people flying around the world to be at one of those events.
---
Making those "fanfests"-events more public due to official announcements of your sites, possibly created more interest, and even though i am not planning on going to St. Petersburg for example, i am super interested, how many people from russia actually came. I could imagine, since the russian community is based from what i experience pretty big and very tight (whatever the reason is for that) that there might be groups that come to those events the first time, and in fact are bigger in their size then Test or Goons even in iceland or Vegas, especially since all those cities and countries, are basically cheaper to visit then iceland or vegas.
---
I always find it sad, that there are so many players, that cannot cover the costs, as income is much lower in their countries, that iceland or vegas is basically not doable for them. And all those events beeing public might be a huge thrive as alot of from those countries can now participate.
---
According to Reddit I thought we were? Aren't we the baddies?
---
in that case it was less about having not them ready and more about not having them outside the system to cyno in, allowing for bubbles to control warp ins.
---
Yikes.
---
New True Sight out FYI 
---
We prob should have called a warp to the fort and gtfo earlier to cut our losses, lol.
---
So long and thanks for all the fish
---
Jesus dude i know you work with goons now but that doesnt mean you need to sample *all* their kool-aid.
---

Really not fair to speak about them "trash FC". Peraps PGL need to learn to respect his ennemies.

Beans aren't cannon fodder, they are the most blood thirsty players I've ever seen, new players are thrown straight into the fight, are looked after, given free ships, skill books etc. They aren't cannon fodder or a meat shield they are looked after and respected, supported and guided. We all started somewhere.

No.  Many issues.  Station.    Long range comms.  That thing that lets you see far away....

Fixed so its now truthful.
---
Burners are not overpowered, it is just the normal rats that are underpowered. 
---
I use a Hawk too, you will need Faction Damagemods, Faction Ammo and a Target Painter/Web Combination to make enough dps and apply them well enough to kill it. Still takes 1 Reload on rocket launchers and a short heating of TP and Launchers at the end. A Synth Crash Booster (cheap/no drawback 3% explo radius) may help you apply. Not to mention that your missile application skills should be at 4, better 5 for that.
---
Wait what? How did I miss this happening? Is there a detailed account somewhere?
---
Fucking lol

Log in and break local on your account by closing sockets until you no longer appear in local after session change, then jump into the bot system?

Yep because the average line member of Goonswarm pays all the ratting isk into the srp wallet right? ..

who are u?

wtf I hate fax now

I hear the alliance B0T gives away free programs with every membership.
---
I do agree that we need more variety in our current content, and it might not generate much content as it is, I just want more potential to have content, making WH appear more attractive even if its just by copy/pasting content is fine by me. Its better than nothing.
---
Mostly you don't farm these holes for the anoms. They spawn ridiculous amounts of relic and DED sites which are quite lucrative. 
---
Wouldnt try that in autz
---
woosh
---
Join the goon newbie corp they will teach you everything you need.

You need to find out whether he has a fixed time interval to warp back to the anomaly, that is when you want to be entering local. That or just getting lucky

Command Destroyers were added in December 2015. In May 2016 the term "booshing" already seemed to have caught on according to https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4lowwn/terminology/?st=jqz77yf6&amp;sh=d9398e02 so it was certainly a fast thing.
---
The Eve Uni wiki only had the term added in May 2017 so that's not a lot of help https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/index.php?title=EVE_Lexicon&amp;diff=121297&amp;oldid=121293

Urbandictionary has a definition though https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=booshing&amp;utm_source=search-action

"Throwing unexpecting persons into bushes or shrubery." which would certainly make sense.

It has 50% upvotes and 50% downvotes though which generally indicates regional or even made up slang.

That's a funny way of spelling 'test dread'
---
I don't think that's true. If you initiate warp, then the bubble gets dropped, then you start warping (due to align time) then you get caught.
---
very very (very) back in the days, with 1 month old char i was roaming with a fleet in a rifter. All of us were casual players in null corp without sov in Curse. So, our Astarte got caught near gate by much bigger fleet. Guy was tanking them for a while and was very (very) depressed on comms and even our BlackBird bailed without even trying to shooo tackle .  So i warped back to him to "help" with t1 fitted rifter just because otherwise i would feel much worse not doing something.

If it is too funny to ignore (which it is) I think they should let it go.

why is blue donut now a term for “coalition” 
---
this was 2 megacoalitions (hi blue donut) failing to blob another coalition (hi panfam)
---
Those sansha holes are dope. Relics and DEDs for days.
---
Thanks, bro.
---
It's hard to take these guys seriously when the most common criticism they offer is "get fucked."
---
Tri was 2k players at peak I hope you realize
---
sone people are better at the game than you
---
No. When you initiate warp, 10 seconds later a bubble gets dropped, and a minute later you warp thanks to slow align time, you will still ignore the bubble. The server calculates your landing position the moment you press warp, not when you actually go into warp
---
No, I totally agree. I just don't have the patience anymore, and I think my kid will enjoy playing more without having to be the coach's kid. 
---
Not like it's easy to withdraw a payment via credit card as well.
---
I might have to use one of those prepaid credit cards. So annoying 
---
600b in dreads o.O
---
Nah, you are totally nc/pl's battered housewife.

TEST is doing its best to revive the north so they don’t have to reset goon and can continue the “existential enemy” narrative with the north 
---
I think the idea is that if you didn't make the ticket after, you are helping the botters keep botting.
---
Hi, I'm Brisc. Now we're not strangers anymore. 
---
Capital OOF!
---
And on the flipside, TAPI could focus on their subs because all their caps were dead.
---
As I said, an actual relevant currency.
---
And I know they use €.

But fed almost a tril to do it.
---
Did you read the br?
---
you did great until you bragged about it on reddit
---
Nah just awoxed cause he wasnt mining ~~ochre~~ sperrylite first
---
No, I didn't.
---
I said you "won't come back until the big meanie Falcon leaves CCP". I should've disagree with what /u/HempInvader said was your reason for quitting.
---
https://greedygoblinblog.wordpress.com/2018/09/12/why-am-i-not-celebrating-the-end-of-ccp/
---
&gt;I won’t play EVE until certain people aren’t fired and the long list of scandals don’t dry up, showing that the game is managed by professionals now.
---
I'm assuming you meant "are" instead of "aren't", "dries" instead of "don't dry", and that "certain people" refers to at least CCP Falcon. I think those are fair assumptions. Therefore, one of your conditions for returning to EVE is CCP Falcon being fired, no? [You have called Falcon a bully multiple times](http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com/p/dont-play-eve-online.html), which is why I called him a "big meanie". I disagree with your tinfoil framing of the monument vandalism and Falcon being out to get you, of course.

Question. Are the avengers proportionally not worth the loot/salvage they provide? 
---
No, IMO they're a waste of time and ammo. They each have huge EHP and they only drop like 20m per ship or something like that (could be a little more). You're better off skipping them and getting on to your next site which is much more profitable. 
---
I remember back in school the boys would make fun of girls they fancied and pull their hair etc. This reminds me of that. Hes just trying too hard for this to be a hate boner.
---
Your opinion does not equate to actual facts.
---
Show the evidence for 50% botting. (you can't)
---
Only a sheep would believe you.
---
I can think of one trash FC that failed at that.
---
Join any alliance with over 50 members and someone will sort you out.
---
There wasn’t a comma 
---
Wasn’t it caused because the community team firing and booking the convention center in Reykjavik was forgotten about? That’s what was floating around when I was at fan fest last year and some of the devs got pretty awkward when asked regarding it

Why shoot HACs when you can lose your ship to shoot 500b in dying dreads
---
amen

i mean it's not like you have a choice...CCP took that away some time ago

Most of the time, complainers either don't care or are unable to conceive of the greater ramifications of whatever hamfisted change they're trying to shill. They flop out their neanderthrashings because they think it'll hurt a particular group of players.

wtb traps in EU tz

that's true for arena games with balanced odds for every side. eve is a sandbox which is unfair by nature and immensely hampers the p2w aspect of the game. Just look as abyssal pvp and it's arena. purely luck/p2w/TZ based
---
Rate my ticks gave me a few options a friend told me about test renters too ill check with them too.

Same here.

The burden of proof rests on the person making the claim, you made a claim and then refused to back it up. You are a coward and a liar.

Wasn't the case this time but I appreciate the advice. I was able to fight him off with just the Rait--had he actually brought Logi I would have been in trouble.

U after isk, salvage or boosting standings for running your own high lvl missions?

Please reconsider. As one who voted for you I expect you to carry on. There will always be people who complain. Your a politician and should understand this.   
---
Your passionate and you want to make a difference. That is good enough for me. 
---
Please reconsider. 
---
Test should be, isnt this is an invasion after all?!? GF!!
---
all combined smaller than tapi alone even with PL.
---
not sure what you're tryin to prove here
---
Here I thought this was pushed out hours after the battle. Imma guess this has been used a few times, hmm?
---
If you win the fight does it really matter? 
---
Of course i dont give a sh\*t about defending a system that is why I rent. Renting a system means exactly that owning a system to play as you wish in null sec. You pay for everything on it to enjoy eve as you like.  When you rent with them you have 0 obligations with them. Rate my ticks for example, they offered all the systems available and they just ask in return to respect standings. That is all.
---
Ain't that the truth. All the cool stuff seems to happen in AUTZ recently
---
for days? in a 1-2 hour span you can clear that hole and the ISK is trash, might was well go gas a Vital or Instrumental for better isk.  Give me a C13 WR anyday, which by they way for the most part are picked clean as well unless you want to mine ice or ore.
---
deja vu
---
Its a nice change from wormhole sites, in a wormhole setting. Its pretty dope.

that aged well
---
Nope. Test and friends got roflstomped on this one.
---
Think we all won then. 
---
dread's are the new subs these days
---
Ship make bwoosh sound.
---
Thanks.
---
What a mess. There's way too much "rules for thee and not for me" in this game.
---
Heya Friend. We have an entire subreddit dedicated to exactly this:
---
reddit.com/r/evejobs
---
Please head on over there for recruitment stuff :) 
---
This isn't a 'blow off' or anything - due to the volume of these kinds of posts they tend to  get a... negative response on r/eve directly. Fortunately r/evejobs is lurked daily by recruiters from all over the place.
---
Well he deleted this thread really quick.
---
If my memory serves me right I've seen Gobbins say PGL to be one of the best FCs around. Usual trash talk aside, you got to respect your enemies or get dunked.
---
Hello Friend,
---
Due to the volume of these types of posts we remove them and refer you on over to r/evejobs. Typically these threads are received very negatively on r/eve directly and / or derail into rants which is kind of happening in your thread :P.
---
Please take it over there if the answers you got at this point are insufficient.

Who the fuck are you and why should we care?
---
I'm donating all my shit to old corpmates, James 315, or leaving ships randomly floating out in space.  But I'm definitely biomassing.  Don't need the temptation, and I believe skill injectors are a big part of Eve's problems right now, so I'm taking my SP out with me.  My little contribution to the future of the game. 
---
Nah, gotta get rid of a few more things this week, but the characters on both accounts are getting the ol' biomass treatment.  
---
When they first came out... I hate the terminology / lingo and I know a lot of people share it but nothing else really dominated the naming scheme. I always thought that multiple MJDs coordinating jumps together reminded me of crip-walking (see: old snoop dogg videos), callem OGs.
---
Maybe some hot sauce will make it easier to eat that crow.
---
Fair enough ;)
---
The real play, just blanket a region in alpha clones lmao
---
Don't forget the r/eve "No question is stupid" thread which is effectively perma stickied. Newbie-help on the r/eve discord is actually decent as well (even if the rest of the server is trash).
---
FC, OnE mOrE jIgGLe?

Fear not PGL... the Dread King of the North will come on swing wings - soon.tm

"Yep. Swamp gas."

I thought Snuff only does pvp in lowsec?
---
Standings boost.
---
Good idea I will add it.
---
Although I will point out it's not there for now and it's really disappointing, especially because I tend to refresh it everyday in hope of finding a question I can answer for as long as possible rather than working.
---
Booshing is the act of forcing some1 else to mjd with you.
---
My tinfoil framing? All I did was verbatim quoted Sion here: https://greedygoblinblog.wordpress.com/2018/11/09/bad-news-goon-there-is-no-memory-hole-on-the-internet/
---
There is no place for "disagreement" here. You can only claim that Sion lied on this post, despite its accuracy wasn't disputed by Falcon or CCP and he was a CSM member back then.
---
eh, it's only dreads and carriers. 300 of them but it's still disposable hulls. the fun was probably worth the feed

Master baiting.

First time I heard it used was 2 days after it came out when our corp made a magus comp in Amamake.  Our CEO Mirrorgod used the term on the fleet and said I'm gonna try and boosh this douche. and we had a good laugh at that.  I'm not saying he coined the term, but it was the first time we had heard it and it stuck with us and it was always called that after that moment.

In what world are you ever going to bait PL?

nah i didnt, but glad to see goons got dunked as well
---
Show me on the killboard where they touched you.

Done. I'll stick around.

Thank you for that! And the rest of the fight.

Go ahead then and use your chinky isk seller alliance.

you think it’s more fun running level 2 and 3 missions for a month or being able to jump into a cruiser at the end of the month?
---
haha just excited to be winning this war 😎
---
Confirming geminate is thunderdome for lazy shit pvpers Like me
---
Eve .. doing real international diplomacy
---
Yeah, they’re super good isk.
---
You can jam the burners with one char, and have dps on another IIRC
---
Or use daredevils and kirins and make 200m an hour per char lol
---
So he ejected and some muppet blew up the ship instead of flying off with it. 
---
Lols
---
Also CCP..  gift these folks omega
---
This is not tenable, firstly because such a party would not be trustworthy as individual dedicated holding corps.
---
Secondly the problem is defense. It is impossible to defend all of highsec, and if you consolidate all structures then you give one massive target to dec for a low fee.
---
The only way this could possibly happen would be if there were a singular force in EVE that dedicated itself to doing so and had an absurd force superiority over everyone else. They would also have to strongarm other holding corps out of existence.
---
However if such a force were to exist it would be prone to fragmentation. Moreover, it would be sensible to fragment holding corps by region in order to manage risk.
---
Therefore a stable monolithic holding corp for all of highsec is not possible under current mechanics.
---
&gt;The photo shows that you are on friendly terms with Falcon, which means you can expect favors from him. It’s like me making a photo with Kim Jong Un and then casually joking that your city will be nuked.
---
Taking a photo with Falcon and mentioning you is a threat now? This isn't the mafia cosying up with the president. Yeah, tinfoil is an accurate description of your thought process. You weren't silenced, and you weren't banned so those favours didn't do a whole lot, huh?
---
I've probably got some photos with devs too from the several Fanfests I've been to, I even have dozens of their signatures. Is me mentioning that a threat to you? Don't be so ridiculous, the world isn't out to get you.
---
Talking to you is so boring because you can't consider any other conclusion than the one that makes you out to be a victim of a conspiracy for opposing the big bad monolithic-Goon. 
---
Salt 🧂 
---
Thanks chaps.
---
You should be. I would fuck this game up beyond measure bringing back every oppressive cancer meta that was nerfed until the entire of New Eden was in total anarchy and flaming ruins. I’d give the Mittani a personal deathstar that could Earp anwhere and destroy fortizars and planets just to see the whole of the game erupt in rage, and then put concord on a 30 day strike so the pirates could rape and pillage through hi sec. then when everyone has rage quit I’d launch eve 2 with all the stupid design decision debt removed built on a framework fit for this era of gaming and so based on activities not time so people were encouraged to do different stuff to acquire skills rather than krab. So yeah, be glad I’m not in charge because I would fuck everything up beyond recognition. 
---
Thanks chaps. 
---
Gotta remember: Always do your shit-talking BEFORE the fight, never afterwards. Better to shit-talk before, no matter the outcome, because of you win and shit-talk after the fight ends, then you’re just a sore-winner.
---
Well you could write whatever you did wrote (tl;dr) 
---
So i assume you are not occupied enough to be unable to explain to me what is going on
---
Do COSMOS agents in vale of the silent, then the guristas epic arc and you will have enough faction standing to do lvl 4s in venal
---
Not everyone has an ego the size of yours
---
Er, *Phrasing*. 
---
Imiarr Timshae used to do this, no idea if they're still around.
---
&gt; You can also only activate one of each pack per account.
---
does this also apply to the backs bought through the official eve "dlc" page? I would like to buy the $50 thing again, but I have bought it once before.
---
It would be nice if neutral logi was not possible and the logi had to be in-corp. That would also encourage serious entities to consolidate and we would see larger highsec groups.
---
I think additionally, being able to use booshers on corpmates and legal war targets would be cool.
---
Classic fucking show
---
This has been the battlecry for 2 years now
---
Ok Google: who do I leaq to 
---
Sure about that?  Seems it needs a test because if you hit the button but are not aligned and you’re IN a bubble you don’t warp.  
---
I think the same thing happens when you’re on grid with the bubble and your warp target is behind it.  
---
... I’ll try it later.  Thanks for pointing it out as a possible mechanism.  
---
Imperial TAPI?

Yup you keep winning i need to sale more dread hulls

---
Considering EVE is a MMO and you play online, that is not possible unless someone at some point reverse engineered the game and created their own game server. Pretty sure that hasn't happened, or at least none of those servers got to an actually playable state. 
---
What makes EVE fun is the one single "shard" we all play on.
---
just thought it was worth since their doing an op later
---
Depends on several things I guess, like if anyone gives a fuck about it, if they are hard to get or any random with a new alt can get that same information, and things like that.
---
[Called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ag3ert/the_csm_is_fine_it_just_has_a_pr_problem/ee4ama8/?context=1) They literally like having their egoes stroked and a free trip to Iceland...

I was with Horde early and I’ll give the credit to Gobbins for being smart enough to know when to stand ground and when to withdraw. The approach was very similar to goons when they were the underdog fighting BoB in that he didn’t care about all the reddit salt miners and just focused on what was good for the horde newbros. Moving south was pivotal and taking the first sov down there gave everyone a sense of what they could achieve, he b up competency gradually with some incredibly good comps like ferox fleets and thrashers that weren’t a huge drain on losses but incredibly efficient at winning fights. Supporting ratting ops and other isk making activities ensured people were always funded to keep fleeting up. The early capital group was very efficient at only using dreads and carriers to take objectives. Horde also got a lot of community support for being the newbro underdog fighting the mittanis viceroy menace. Of course it helped that horde had the supervising parent of PL with lots of newbros cutting their teeth under highly experienced PL FC’s which attracted a lot of returning vets who didn’t want the expectation burden of PL proper or having to do an arts and craft project. The biggest benefit horde had was learning from Brave Newbies failures as well as experienced Brave guys who helped PL guys understand the challenges of herding cats. Huge respect to Gobbins, Travis Uchonola, Travis Keikira, and all the other guys who worked hard in those early months to make Eve fun again for a lot of players at a point when the game was probably struggling. I think Horde has probably done a lot to keep Eve going by giving a reason for new players to sub and stay, and the healthy competition between the newbro friendly corps has kept them all honest and focused on competing with a good offer rather than keeping the old guard elitist jerks attitude that existed before Brave tore up the rule book. I think it’s ironic that Horde is probably now what keeps PL going, the way Karmafleet keeps Goonwaffe relevant. Without the newbro ‘F1 Monkeys’ the old guard of goons,PL et al would be just a bunch of grumpy bittervets rarely logging in.

TAPI pilots saying the fight was fun in this thread.
---
pretty sure they said in another thread they dont get SRP for fun fleets.
---
Pretty much. If theres a demand then theres someone paying for it. How much they pay depends on how much they want the info. 
---
yes because panfam did not win the objective and got hellcamped for month until they cheated their way out. we all remember that.
---
if you can kill them until they are dead, with a smaller force, it still works.
---
what i'm trying to work out is how i'm supposed to loot the field in a griffin when all the loot is capital sized.
---
Wtf is with the low effort AAR?  Does TET own this subreddit?  I would expect a little more effort from you PGL.

thats just a baseless exaggeration. we take KRABS too.

hard to tell if anyone gives a fuck about them. they've been talked abvout a whole lot on reddit last month

this made me smile.

then i wondered how many kill marks is on it.
---
this made me smile more.

You sound like you're being serious. So I'll bite.
---
I'm on the CSM, its the player elected focus group. Some of the wormholers were being mean to me and calling for me to resign because they don't like me. 
---
So I wrote this as a joke. 
---
Which explains while you're still here. 
---
There are some good guides on youtube nowadays for these, search "Anomic Agent (Whatever faction the ship is)"
---
You will need pretty good skills to pull them off effectively
---
Thanks, fixed
---
Should work now. That little bug should be fixed now
---
AH (i used to be a terrible badposter around here but won eve around 8 months ago so im kinda out of the loop :D thanks for clearyfing :) )
---
So this exploit is still possible in wormholes... maybe fix the code rather than putting half thought out fixes in its place.
---
I guess that are too busy working on the carrier nerf.
---
If it is vital or secret info that could help their enemies, contact them; if it is just to laugh at them post it on reddit already, noone's gonna pay for that.
---
He means UALX you fucking mong 
---
I agree. I don’t expect to be able to “play” eve in the traditional sense more experience the game as it was on release. 
---
Its happend and some are actually quite playable

Eveuni is fucking wonderful. All the data you need for combat sites, indy, some pvp. They have an online resource for you to utilize https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page

Candy Box and Imiaar Timshae were the last two I know of. Candy Box shut down years ago because of the clone changes, upcoming citadel introduction and a rapidly declining player (customer) base.
---
I would assume that by now, with trade citadels not using faction standings, Imiarr is probably shut down as well. 
---
If being a meatshield means I get to fly my free ship, kill things, die, get another free ship, and repeat until the fight is over, I'd gladly be a meatshield.
---
to add to this their [class library](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_University_Class_Library) is full of recorded lessons on all things eve. they also have the E-UNI chat channel in game and answer all sorts of questions.

 You, generally speaking, are a shitty person and you probably smell terrible.

I think that it is a breach of the EULA to run eve on non-CCP authorized servers. I would be careful
---
this actually works?

So definitely a smoothbrain

Join goons and win their primary election.

and dont join a corp until you are ready to leave highsec. most good newbie focused corps will have war decs on them which make flying around in highsec unsafe.
---
- do all the new player experience misisons  
---
- then do the career agent missions   
---
- then the Sisters of Eve lvl 1 mission arc.   
---
- once you have done all these seek out a good newbie focused corp.  
---
Come and try RVB! We are based in high sec but roam into low, have regularly scheduled events and you are pretty much free to do whatever you want.

No requirements, app either to red or blue and it will be accepted soon! You are free to come and go as you please. Join channel R-V-B ingame to chat.

thank you for your service o7

You did it /u/Emrys_Alf - good job.

Look I get it, none of these are good changes for bots.  Null bears or f1 monkeys but you don't have to downvote.  So rude.

I think without tidi some people got to press the DD button 5 times in this fight.

Clearly the obvious answer is to use a looting rorqual. It's got a capital sized tractor beam too.

Can you kill the avengers, then trigger the building and then the kill response BS in one cycle, if you drop the dread on the structure are the avengers likely to spawn too far away to use cap guns on them effectively?

EG I can move the fleet on to the next site whilst the bs

Wow 10b Goon pets br
---
Are you sure it was the rats that killed you? Exploding nullsec cans do 10k damage and it looks like it took less than 9k to kill you.
---
Not true. I've been multiboxing with TVP, WTM, TDF and some others
---
Depending on which standings your looking to boost and or your playing time I could probably resub my highsec accounts and help you out. Feel free to message me.
---
BOT belongs to Test.
---
It is thier ancestral home lands.
---
Gracias!
---
Not entirely true.
---
They need to be inform by this. With violence.
---
Even if it did it would be against TOS
---
Pretty sure he means the panfam dread bomb vs TAPI supers 6 or so months ago, you mong.
---
You would turn poor super fast.
---
Thanks but don't want to put you to any trouble.  Just wondered if anyone was doing it right now.  
---
I'll buy tags and run courier missions I suppose.
---
~3.50 and it's a deal.
---
Sad indeed 
---
shhhh. more spodbrains = more killmarks.
---
I've just been in this place before
---
The Yulai incident(s) weren't the cause of the highway change IIRC, just the concord change. They just didn't want one central hub (also they def needed more 0.0 entry points). They didn't quite count on the fact that people wanting a hub and just making another one though. And I'm fine with the player base forgetting things, but as a dev you should know the history of the game you're working on. 
---
That was a fast three years. 
---
That also made Goons+TAPI bigger blue donut right now.
---
I think there is a command to upgrade ihub you might have to check it out
---
So many reasons why I love this man. Doesn't get any better than this boys and girls.
---
Fair.
---
Anyone coming into /r/eve sees this and thinks wow this games community is full of fucking douche bags. 
---
Imperium uses dreads like we use thrashers. Looks like good fights were had.
---
Hey I'm based in Jita and can run some Caldari L4's for you today if you want. PM me.
---
sadly true. and more expendable. 
---
how did they cheat their way out, pray tell
---
3 killmails isn't quite 50% for all the players in Delve. You're a bullshitter.
---
Tell you what, why don't you provide evidence for even 5%. I bet you can't. You got no facts, just talk.
---
don't forget Blessed Beans. the graduation corp for Horde with tokens required. but background checks only limited to a full body search.  not your family.
---
ImperTAPIum?
---
God damn jiggle drives
---
don't want to spoil it to you .... more rorquals, more titans

yeah i really enjoyed discovering the game in my first month. Not everyone enjoys a game where you are guided towards the optiml way of playing.

And they would be right.

I mean they tried :p didnt do much hardly ever dropped.

Hey any news on using your body for a gate to lowsec in stain?
---
Of you need to ask, you're probably not going to find a buyer
---
I though the same thing before I joined based on the reddit posts and comments...Then I joined, just to test drive them...1 month later I moved all my chars there... For a newbro alliance, they are pretty well organized and are really friendly.
---
He's talking about when PL dropped 300 dreads vs tapi, i believe it was in provi or possibly derelik.

shit no kidding, I thought they were added a year ago at most

We had our first discussions about taking a 1 year FF break and trying something new in early 2017 I believe...could have been a bit earlier. So it was definitely a conscious decision ;)

Funny coming from you
---
I've tested this, it works like that.
---
Being inside a bubble while warping is a different code path or something. Likely while you're aligning to warp the game is checking for points / bubbles on every tick and at the moment it puts you into warp.
---
probably right. i'll just post them
---
What patch was that in November 2016 that caused this huge spike?
---
Interesting is that this was the only real increase in 4 years of otherwise steady decline ...
---
Just do what bots do. Dodge the tos like a pepega and do it anyways. CCP doesn't bother doing anything about nullsec bots but they wanna ban people because *flash news* their chat system is broken? 
---
CCP has removed or circumvented almost every reason to have high standings.  The only thing left is access to missions.
---
Their meeting space is great. A lot bigger and very flexible. Only downside would be a slightly longer walk to get there from some areas of the hotel but it's a much bigger hotel than the LINQ so that's hard to avoid. Planet Hollywood was about the same in this regard. The location of the hotel is great. Next to the promenade and straight in the middle of the strip.
---
Hope to see you there! :)
---
I never said the scripted incidents were the cause for the highway change.
---
Devs don't need to know the history, it's just a job to them.
---
so you either get a kill, or shut them down until the bubble is cleared...  Don't remember how much bubbles cost, but sounds decent.  Keep doing that and they'll either move, or disable the "don't move if there is a bubble" thing.
---
And even more important: Is there a rotation counter?
---
The bot checks the POS grid, for a super it's easy and "worth" for a carrier just let it be it's not worth the effort
---
Some of us have severe Brisc fatigue.
---
NC would like to have a word with whoever came up with PanFam :/
---
I wonder if this has anything to do with his parole restrictions and being around little kids?...
---
Yes probably. I’ve been living out of a quiet hisec backwater recently and daytripping into WH space to get used to solo roaming again. I rolled a new alt and just took the noob t1 frigate with a shitfit and went exploring to sharpen up my scanning and bookmarking skills. It’s actually the first time I got a decent adrenaline rush playing cat and mouse with a T3C who was trying to scan me down. The fantastic thing is with a 600k ship it’s a no lose playstyle as I hauled out over 70m in explorer loot in 2 afternoons with a 600k ship I got for free. Even if I get caught I lose pretty much nothing and it feels like some sort of burglary to ninja in and out. Having flown blinged out ships and pods for years it’s kind of fun just to Leeroy about in a worthless killmail ship and trying to scavenge while being probed down knowing you can’t fight back is a great reminder of the early days I spent in low/nullsec. I’m not sure I’d want to move full time into WH living at the moment as I’d end up getting dragged back into min/maxing PVE and serious PvP fitouts which is what I was trying to escape, going back to the start of ninja salvaging and exploring in fast cheap roam ships is actually more fun than I expected and while 70m isn’t huge by today’s standards of turbokrabbing it was far more fun that grinding L4’s and for a 450k sp noob with a 600k ship it feels more of an achievement. Change does you good.
---
Better rat/mine on sisi and get some practice before the real thing.
---
Ascension. It's the one that created Alpha accounts, wherein players could play for free with a limited skill set for months. Prior to Ascension, an EVE trial period lasted 14 or 21 days (depending on the type of trial you received).
---
Thousands of people signed up to "play EVE for free", but if the new F2P players were truly new EVE players, not nearly enough was done to market the game to them and the spike quickly died. If the new F2P accounts were owned by existing players, then the spike lasted long enough to get them trained (the length of the spike is the length of time it would take to train up the F2P skills).
---
Why did you leave? You said you were just getting groceries but you never came back!
---
Yeah roaming delve and looking at all the input broadcasters isnt evidence.
---
EvE Classic? Yes please
---
I was thinking about R&amp;D datacore farming though.  Otherwise you're right.
---
Tuskrs live in thera with Volta 
---
lol eula.
---
running eve server code will get you straight more than one bargained for, as it's not public in the first place and you would have to steal it.
---
So is this the end of the war?
---
They come back after 7 years. 
---
Every other fun old mmo has emus. I look forward to Eve's, complete with losing sp from not upgrading my clones, learning skills, goofy character creation so I can start with 500k so instead of 56k, and so on. Yay classic eve!
---
Part of what gives Stain that character is the lack of a lowsec gate.  Put in a gate, and it'll become much more like Syndicate.
---
That's pretty impresive, very nice!
---
I'm assuming you found the killmail.  The best part of the whole thing - he didn't kill the MTU first, so more than half the loot got wrecked when the MTU ate shit.  Intelligence test failure. 
---
EVE's been able to handle a fight with a thousand or fewer per side for years, and could handle fights of that size 20 times a day with no problem. It's the fact that EVE players want to bring four or five times that many that's the problem...
---
Lmao this is fucking brilliant 10/10 who wants the gold
---
As someone previously in a small WH Corp getting evicted by outlaws i support this. Kick these fuckers sandcastle over like init did with yours. 
---
Sorry buddy, already all spoken for.  Most went to former corp mates.  Gave a nice chunk to James 315 for the lols.  I'm leaving some random ships floating in space around Derelik and Great Wildlands.  Nothing too shiny, but if you're interested in a scavenger hunt you might get something for free. 
---
Humble Bundle EVE ONLINE: GALAXY PACK
---
You also still get a nice little market tax decrease if I recall correctly.
---
I've quit twice - once for about a year and once for a few months.  Both times I came back I found the game in worse shape than I left - although I managed to find a couple good groups of people to fly with.  But this time I'm out for good.  
---
And? Same goes for wow private servers, yet they do exist 
---
Seconded. Outlaws are cunts. They add nothing to wormhole space. They target growing groups for evictions, the smaller groups starting to get off the ground but not big enough to fight back, because they're fucking cowards and run from a fight.
---
There is another layer between horde inc and vanguard, which is blessed Beans. It’s mostly the same as normal Horde, but you get lower taxes, The only requirements are an API check, and the ability to fly ceptors/battleships. 
---
Vanguard is vouch only, and I don’t know much about it except most of our titans and big FC’s are in there
---
Can I have your SP? Pretty plz? :)
---
I was gonna say "can I have your stuff"....forget it then. I'll see my way out.
---
avengers will spawn as long as the site is still up. What you want to do is align you subs off, warp off all but one then use something like a TP with the last one on the drifter structure to spawn the drifter. then instantly warp the last nestor off. The drifter will spawn and warp off to a planet or a wh. at that point you find it with the dread and kill it.
---
Avengers are a massive waste of time and having the avengers with the drifter will probably kill a solo dread
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
They are not bringing supers.
---
Wait until it inevitably goes on sale.
---
The actual funny thing about this post is a ton of people called you out for being a worthless member of the CSM and you spent quite a bit of time going back and forth with people here on reddit justifying your CSM seat and trying to explain what you have done for the game and why you're not useless. 
---
Then you go and make posts like this and wonder why the majority of players in EVE think you're an embarrassment to the CSM. 
---
You even sat there last week replying to my comments about how much you have done for this game and the community. Saying things like oh I don't know why everyone hates me and thinks I'm a complete retard. Oh I won't let you rewrite history about how shitty of a CSM I was......
---
Then you make posts like this.
---
Like do you fail to realize the irony? 
---
Do you understand yet?
---
Have you taken a look in the mirror and candidly asked yourself what you bring to this community? 
---
Because this post right here is about the highest quality input Brisc Rubal brings to the game.
---
This is the pinnacle of your input..... and it has absolutely 0 relation to this game. 
---
Do you understand why the majority of the players that actually care about the CSM call you a fucking joke? 
---
This is what you do. Congratulations, you hold a CSM seat and get reddit gold for making a silly post about little league on the r/eve subreddit. 
---
It's sad because you have people like Suitonia, who actually fucking care and create community discussions about game mechanics, propose legitimate balance ideas, and seeks out players input because he actually cares about the state of the game. 
---
If you still haven't figured it out you're a fucking idiot but I'll explain it for you. 
---
YOU BRING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO THE COMMUNITY OR THE GAME. 
---
That's why all of EvE thinks you're a fucking joke.
---
I suspect this was not the response OP was hoping for.  It is, however, the correct response. 
---
fake: braxus didnt mention getting fucked in the ass
---
gay: op 
---
No they are not, because what's to gain from it except bashing every structure with supers until everyone is bored to death. Doesn't mean they are small under dog, especially in sov warfare.
---
I will always remember that fight as the time I got top non-cap damage on a titan with a gleam tachyon abaddon that drained 1/5th of the capacitor every single shot
---
Nope.  Skill injectors are a cancer on the game at the same level as Rorqs, Super ratting, and citadel spam.  The skill points die with my character. 
---
oh yeah what do you know about it
---
Ah man, it will be great. That feeling when you first get your mining battleship and you much rocks at speeds that shouldn't even be possible.

Yes, it is exactly a mafia cosying up to the president. Goons literally committed a real world crime to get me into felon status. Falcon did everything to save them from the consequences. Where is this statement wrong?

Go PvP instead of krabbing and it will be fixed
---
I'm glad to see all 5 HK members are still playing after their eviction.
---
You... don't know what reverse engineering means.
---
Kingless as a whole seem to be doing ok.
---
considering the server code has not changed from 2003, its a safe bet you can still use it
---
Ohh... Well, I see your point here, and although I understand where you are coming from... Well, it is still a major waist T.T
---
If anything, at least give the SP to your friends, It would be a darn good parting gift from you! 
---
And no waisting... Waisting of good SP is sad :(
---
they were pretty much called booshers from day 1

Yeah I meant Odin's call when I said Out Of Focus. Good guys. Mainly USTZ though?
---
I still stand by my endurances. Basically cap stable active tank while sig tanking everything above a desy. Drones to counter rats, no cloak speed penalty, and warps much faster than barges. Because of this I never have to leave the sites until I'm full. Where as the barges typically have to warp out when rats show up. I mine more than the barges because of this.
---
tl;dr
---
It is actually a c1 WH. 
---
I remember a Reddit post a couple of days ago where TEST basically shit posted a 22b to 8b win against PanFam on entosis ops. Now they are silent after this battle. Why so?

Update posted in OP!

I would need to consult my WH book of law, but I don't remember anything about how a WH alliance/corp who has been evicted cannot evict anyone anymore.
---
Thanks for the offer! Sorry I saw it too late. Update posted in OP.
---
Thanks for the offer to help! Sorry I saw it too late. Update posted in OP.
---
Well there's no point because EVE without the large player base is pointless itself.
---
But reverse engineering itself is well-protected legally - it's how we got "IBM-compatible" computers in the first place and have the unified computing environment that makes any of this possible.

*Billions of tons of ore only available to players with 30 omega accounts and maxed rorquals(skill injectors are available for purchase), a supercap umbrella and when Olmeca Gold isn’t in system, free players can expect to mine literally hundreds of grams of ore and build nothing of value.
---
Thanks, suspected that (cannot check myself from office cause ccp sites locked). Basically what I said, Alpha Accounts were just a smokescreen on the years long steady decline of both logged in accounts and real persons per account. It may have impressed some investors but ot their core clientel ...

I would just like to tell you thank you for being a productive, helpful, and informative member of this community!
---
Anytime I see your posts you are pleasantly explaining game mechanics or clarifying them to people without any sort of insult. That's very helpful and giving back to the player base. 
---
It's appreciated and noticed by the community. I wanted to take the time to recognize this because I'm having a hard time explaining to some current CSM members what it means to bring something to the community and why it matters as a CSM member to give back to the community. 
---
[INIT now](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/FC5QZEo.jpg)
---
This. Just avoid the avengers all together. You get very little for grinding through them and you're on grid for a lot longer which increases risk without much more reward. Again, you're better off just letting the drifter go somewhere else and then killing it. 
---
A small group of members that were in the Goonswarm alliance (which has 30k+ characters now?) committed a crime. One of the group that vandalised the monument laughably tried to implicate you in it. You were at no risk having never left your basement/kitchen.
---
Falcon eventually got hold of the vandals, after they turned themselves in, and having spoke to them perhaps felt they were remorseful or just didn't want to go through the trouble of pressing charges, and struck a deal to have them pay for the damage to the monument. Falcon probably just didn't want to implicate thousands of players for the crimes of a few.
---
Nah, it's gotta be that The Mittani ordered the hit on Xenuria's name, then sent Sion to threaten CCP Falcon to not press charges and cover the whole thing up, only then to order him to write a confession that confirmed it was Goonswarm members that did it. Also, jet fuel doesn't melt steel beams and Obama intentionally created ISIS.

Not at full price. Those bundles are often sold at half off, so just wait for the next sale.

Free players can expect code to destroy their ship
---
So... Pretty accurate then
---
Wait for promo. For day to day use plex. Usually if there is promo for them its way smaller so less loss when paying full price 
---
can confirm, i ran one a couple days ago, too. There was an explosion, but nothing went wrong for me.
---
Does the Mittani actually play this game or is he just a political figure head. 
---
I'd love to hear from the actual Mittani what his favorite in-game activities are.

The Yulai incidents I'm referring to aren't the scripted ones, I'm talking about the zombies smartbombing.
---
Have you ran the SoE Epic Arc? That should bypass most/all of the L1/L2 mission grinding.
---
:monkagiga:
---
But..... that’s what HK is supposed to do?
---
SnAPI?
---
knowing the game for more than a decade, i naturally let reverse engineering completely out of the equasion. It‘s Eve.
---
TAPI buys their dreads in Delve?
---
No wait for it to be 1/3 of that price on Green Man Gaming.
---
PL and PH are the Pan, NC is the Fam
---
So, what do you propose that a brand new player do? Go to FW, and feed shitfit t1 frigates to experienced players, who will either fly circles around a new player outside of their range, or dive in close and destroy them in seconds with short range weapons? 
---
Go explore without an idea of which regions are dangerous, which have good loot, or how to use dotlan/zkill? 
---
The big nullsec alliances don’t force you to play the game their way. I spent a lot of time not going on fleets, just making isk to fly comets in FW space. 
---
The big alliances just give people decent advice, free ships/skills, and an easy way into smallgang and large fleet pvp, with either standing fleet or organized fleets. 
---
Tbh that kinda seemed to cover it. They got counter baited. BR lines up with that, nothing much else happened 
---
The invuln only takes the place of what would be a point. It's still a 200 base dps dessy with blaster tracking and drones and a decent armor tank.
---
Wow u killed a destroyer , worth a reddit post ..
---
Was this all that useful as a "bug" especially at cutting the command dessie's escape tool role along with it's ability to force asymmetric aggression timers ( something that is very useful in fleet split up tactics ). 
---
&gt; Eve is growing
---
Nope? Maybe just take a look at the steady slope the logged in account average has taken constantly since 4 years at least?
---
I won't even talk about accounts per player stats, as this would be just an educated guess, but just the number of logged in accounts clearly tells the fact that EVE playerbase is not growing since 4 years at least. 
---
Hey bud, I just checked this out, the system looks fine. A lot of the wormholes are there but haven't been jumped through from their starting system yet, which is why they aren't showing yet, give it a while and they will all appear. Looks like you just caught it at a particularly slow time! 
---
In future if you could submit a bug report with more details than this that would be great, it's less likely that we'll see posts here and I had to do some sleuthing to even know which system you were in.
---
Ironically, outlaws is what init claim HK is. Killing small wormhole space.
---
really doesnt matter how many days, what does matter is it crushed that offensive and those guys never recovered.  PL moved their shit north shortly afterwards
---
Sorry, did not /s it, thought it was actually obvious enough this time
---
Right? Ospreys are sick mining vessels. To hell with rorquals.
---
Datacores haven't been farmed from research agents for years, since a cost was added.
---
The vast majority come from faction warfare cash-ins now.
---
I did not /s it, because I thought it was obvious enough. my bad.
---
And then complain during townhall meetings that WH space is empty and stagnating... HK is probably the single most important entity responsible for stagnation in WH space.
---
And now, not even a month after losing their home, they are already evicting smaller entities again, like nothing ever happened.
---
The fact is, HK became fat, complacent and slow and this is what lead to HK's eviction in the first place... But you'd think you'd learn from such a mistake and reflect on your past... but nope... Back at it again.
---
Hope you all burn...
---
pls link me to a feminist rant by rahne
---
That is the other option when it comes to pvp. One of the problems with the "join a corp" narrative is that it has turned the game into what you describe to some extent.
---
&gt;The big nullsec alliances don’t force you to play the game their way. I spent a lot of time not going on fleets, just making isk to fly comets in FW space. 
---
So you are denying the f1-drone type of gameplay.
---
&gt;The big alliances just give people decent advice, free ships/skills, and an easy way into smallgang and large fleet pvp, with either standing fleet or organized fleets. 
---
You just want to fill your useless fleets with more trash so you can one day take on the goons or some other pointless entity.
---
Stagnant null and little content for those who dont want to join is all you get in the end. Very bad for the game.
---
Pretty sure it isnt their first since the eviction of rage but your the spy my guy.

Hey you missed that parenting memo that says every kid is a star athlete.    I coached HS sports in the 90s someone told me I should go help out now and I said I would get in so much trouble now days.  
---
show me on the doll where HK hurt you
---
:snort: Ackshually I will have you know its the ~~War of Sovless Agression~~ thank you very much!
---
I think most people who actually live in wormholes would argue that outlaws (the people mentioned in this thread) are the single most important entity responsible for stagnation in WH space.
---
Yes, the broker fee reduction is still there but most high end market trading (except for Jita) has moved to Upwells where standings are irrelevant.
---
yes yes you were only pretending to be retarded, jokes on us.
---
I wish that were true :(
---
do you really expect PL to care about solo pvp? 
---
\&gt;hk continue to play the video game known as eve online

All you really need to know:
---
-still no ls gate to stain  
---
-HK was a thing and now it's a slightly more defeated, smaller, thing 
---
-rorquals exist 
---
Taxes. Standings with faction &amp; empire owning said station can help in reducing the fees a lot
---
First advice. Never listen to a Goon.
---
They're very cuddly
---
From your terrible english you're probably russian which explains your love for outlaws, seeing as they kill every other russian entity to absorb them. 
---
Beyond that, outlaws is literally what you idiots claim HK is. They target the new groups breathing life into stagnant wormhole space, they deliberately try to prevent new groups from growing to power. More often than not it's HK who has to STOP them you utter retard. 
---

---
What did you guys expect? While we got evicted out of RAGE our farms got hit by multiple groups including Holesale, Dura/Wh0re and Outlaws. You ever heard of retaliation?
---
Holesale already evicted themselves. Dura/Wh0re got evicted already in the past weeks and Outlaws is next.
---
Also if we would be "fat" we wouldnt have been able to do what did the last the weeks or today. lmao
---
I think if I need a doll, HK needs a warehouse full of dolls, seeing what happened last month.
---
You should just put /dumbass on every post, its pretty obvious but just helps everyone know you are challenged

yeah hk are a bunch of idiot retards for staying in wormhole space and having fun they should have stayed down before they get kicked in the teeth again those big dumb idiots picking on poor defenseless outlaws who help small corps grow by protecting them from dumb hk and never did anything wrong they just stay to themselves hk should leave them alone what bullies

&gt;Being proud of your election to the CSM is like winning the gold medal at the special olympics.

The Special Olympics are a serious RL competition where serious athletes compete and win. Haven't you seen the South Park episode starring \~\~Brisc Rubal\~\~ Eric Cartman?
---
yea the its always the same dudes who bite ;)

Probably Brisc, with how much he tweets about hating Trump now.
---
evenews24 is worthless

Yea, if they hadn't gotten so fat, complacent, and slow they could have beat those 1200 nerds.
---
You're right. Get it together HK.
---
Goons moved after the war. They built up while everyone else fell apart. Now they harvest revenge tears. CCP now speaks Korean.
---
I've done it multiple times before 
---
Ah, I didn't know that.  I haven't looked over research agents for ages.
---
Yeah this is badly broken like the good post spells out, unlimited slots would mean (practically) unlimited BPOs being researched to run (practically) unlimited build slots and the whole sorry mess falls down. If you want to help out the newbros wouldn't the ability to safely share BPOs within corps be better? Granted massive open corps would probably give the BPC market a firm kicking but at least the knock on effects would be limited by the amount of BPOs out there.
---
It was reported when I noticed it. The number has grown up to 8, but that was half an hour ago.
---
The other drifter holes were fine.
---
thats true about highsec, the infamous CODE are the only guys who make mining in highsec a bit risky 
---
alternative facts are real! wake up sheeple!
---
you have the basics of it down for sure.
---
Right, might as well circle jerk it up and say it was 3 months. Ccp was the cause of this, so stroking yourself thinking the south dealt a massive blow to anyone is just spin. The best part of the whole thing is that PL was able to get out without any issues and you chuckle fucks claim they exploited the game to do so. 
---
It's fake PK from Maverick Navy. Left NC for irrelevancy

I chatted with one of our other devs here and it does look like something slightly strange is going on here actually. Thanks for the bug report! I'll take a further look tomorrow for you

Some days ago i was at comms with some friends and this guy dacler was blaming eve because his cyno did not open he was yelling at comms while he needed help. his story was funky and i found this video kinda funny and the comments helped me understand the situation
---
But... Here i am! 
---
This is fake news.
---
HK is a dead corp. They aren't evicting anyone.
---
Pocket change for a lawyer/politician/little league coach.
---
gonna start loading 'Respect' ammo from now on so I can win better
---
Tbf HK was like outlaws in early wormhole iirc, and I think I do recall correctly because a close friend of mine quit the game after we were evicted by them, and almost everyone in the Corp swore off wormholes and went to nullsec together.
---
Oh man, this issue is even bigger in French. In old TCF days, we used to say "JUMPEZ" or "JUMPEZ PAS" when waiting on a game. I can't recall how many times this fucked some lemmings in fleet. 
---
So how many do you find on average each month?
---
Could be wrong, but I started hearing it first on Bjornbees fleets. 
---
Fun facts: There are more than 3 Sansha WHs, the static anom's can escalate, DEDs are 100% the same.

Oh go session change yourself.

man you guys really make the fact that it was a blue-eyes tackle obvious from this video
---
you fucking plebs, it's zoop and/or mjdoodle
---
Smart thinking to not mention any specifics so this can be re-used again and again.
---
Outlaws deserve to be blobed and abused.
---
Common mistake, the regulation is actually texas law. There is fortunately an exception where the invading FC can challege the home FC to a dance off at the sun and the losers must leave the hole.
---
True facts about the Tapir!

Brilliant by CCP: Thousands of bot account subs, or thousands of cloaky camper account subs, they care not.

Blue eyes tackle = blue guy tackling him? Or blue guy scouting his location so others can warp to it?

Fair enough.

You should tell that kid to not talk to strangers and a rather adult aimed online game. Others he'll be baited and fucked for real one day.

Nice!

Looking forward to checking it out.

Will probably make Vegas and Eve Down Under this year.  Sadly will miss Evesterdam.  
---
I didn't mean it makes you a botter.

In my eyes what you say you did is this: Hey guys I found an illegal botter ruining our game and killed him twice but I also extorted him for illegally made ISK to leave him keep doing the illegal shit he was doing. Please clap.

It has been, but I cannot see it now..

only shows the can itself not the contents.

Most aren't :(

HK has done some shit in the past, I won't defend nor deny that. But the game as it is now is in a different place.
---
Eve is new player friendly .... this sub-Reddit is not. 😂
---
Scratch that, the thing that has changed is that when I search with "asset safety" I can only see the can.  
---
When I search without any search text, then I can see the contents.

Just go claim sov, put an ihub in and use /boostsov. Anomalies will spawn.

Given how terribly bug infested the initial release was playing off the original install disc would not be great - it would need to have the first expansion and all the patches up to that to be worth doing.... and without people to play alongside it would be terrible ... much like today’s eve
---
I would however like to have the original startup screen. I miss that.
---
Trying to start a fight without being prepared to risk a 30 trillion isk, functionally irreplaceable titan fleet, without which your alliance would immediately get evicted to lowsec?
---
Silly progod. You gotta man up!
---
What is this “casino war” of which you speak?
---
Oh ... you mean WWB!
---
You couldn't be more of an idiot if your tried. 
---
You really haven't been paying attention to wormhole space if you think outlaws are the little guys and hk is the evicting menace
---
It was already mentioned above, but  [https://www.thealphasguide.com](https://www.thealphasguide.com/)  is a really great resource that I've used to get some real life buddies into the game, and as a guide when I'm not around to help them in early days. 
---
In addition to this I'd make sure you take a [recruit a friend link](https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=8d8bfe0c-1f77-402b-aa18-5ce51c6b587c) when you make your account, especially if you're just downloading it now. The person who's link you use only gets rewarded if you ever go omega but you will instantly start off with a bonus 250,000 skill points which really helps you as a new player get the basic skills to get into your first ship.
---
Once you're set up and through the tutorial, take a look at the basic frigates for all of the races and pick your favorite. Yes there are more correct and less correct answers down the road, but as a new player picking something that looks cool and fun to fly is more important. Use your bonus SP to get the basic skills for that ship and have fun diving into Eve Online!
---
No representation is my 9 accounts and who I want.
---
To add to this - how do people test ratting in wh's? Is there a good system with Freeport? All the systems they have in moveme don't have a way to get the ship in, since you can only /moveme in a pod.
---
The reality is that Outlaws. have evicted far more smaller groups than HK ever has, and nearly every single entity, small or large in wormhole space HATES Outlaws. 
---
Outlaws, by no means is small at ALL. They can easily field 100+ man fleets, and have done so before against HK. Outlaws is a formation of what used to be Inner Hell, which had the first full fit Keepstar die in wormhole space
---
I know that the people running it are highly unethical, and I'd urge any current or former test member to enable 2fa and reset their password for discord to disabled compromised tokens yeah
---
Thank you for the advice! 
---
maybe one day I will be a strategic operations fleet commander in a major nullsec alliance
---
yeah...the only other option is reddit...and thats...well.....yeah.  shit xD
---
Tbh i actually forgot wormholes existed when i said that.
---
&lt;_&lt;
---
&gt;_&gt;
---
Just like ccp.
---
I'm not accusing you of lying, because HK certainly did some evictions back in the day.  But I've seen several claims like this in the past which were proven false (honestly I think the passage of time clouded memory).  What was the name of the corp you were in that HK evicted?  I'd like to check Zkill.  
---
I can't recall the last time Exodus. baited with anything. We usually just chase things down with our interceptors and hold it until A. a fight starts or B. We kill it with our dps. But if you think we bait and blob then great, thx.
---
I'm honestly unclear here - are you defending Inner Hell here?  Are you making a joke?
---
Wait, aren't you that same dude that posted on the job boards about how you wanted to join a wh corp without giving your esi, using any mapping tools, and "wanting to play eve the way it was meant to be played"
---
And then got shit on by literally every response telling you how reality works? Looks like you deleted your name and all your posts, but thankfully I can still find it.
---

How bout you go to Nullsec, sounds like wormholes aren't really the right place for you
---
There are multiple bubbles he coould attempt to use, including an interdictor if he gets his timing down right. It's relatively easy for me to kill botting VNIs though.
---
This is unironically a solid theory
---
UALX. That is all. Dude posts a gf, you shitbirds do your usual. You wonder why everyone in Eve wants PL dead? We want you off the server, gone. Eve won't miss 300 dudes in a trash alliance. 
---
This is the correct answer, or blue eyes
---
you havent logged in the past year then
---
Their main pvp is ragerolling null. Nobody owes anyone else fights and content (except PvE'rs, PvE should be a content catalyst by CCP design). Nobody has to feed ships to elite wormholers in their prearranged wh fights meta. That's not a parameter on whether an entity should be evicted. 
---
If there is anyone who wants to and can evict an entity, they should go for it. That's the parameter. Outlaws have been doing that. Anyone else can do that to them. That's the wh life.
---
And to think... if you replaced "Initiative" with "PL", this post would have blended perfectly into any thread about goons in 2016.  
---
New player here is roaming for 30 minutes for a cyno or vni kill good gameplay?
---
lol who is this guy 
---
Watched this like 3 times now 
---
It might be boring, but at one point it was pretty profitable, scaled well, and was a beautiful environment to zone out in.
---
Guessing, maybe recompense for invading MTO-2 during their war with Tri?
---
you can undock and moveme in a ship. 
---
He probably doesnt know enough about wh space to realize that Outlaws are inner hell.
---
I bet in a week of 4 hour a day mining an alpha could mine enough to build another venture.
---
nobody owes anyone a fight, but if you dock up and log off the second you find a pvp group in chain, you aren't "breathing life" into anything
---
and if you aren't breathing life into wormhole space, you don't need to be there 
---
You're confusing outlaws and inner hell. INHE rolls nulls. And if by your logic, the big groups should kill all small groups because they can, wormhole space would cease to have any actual inhabitants.
---
Wormholers don't tend to kill off those who create content. There's no enough of us as is. 
---
I usually practice guitar with the hud off while doing it. Then some dickweed comes along and pods me before I finish playing wonderwall

If anyone wants to tip the creator: HAWG 1-1 ingame ;)

Did they installed an up well structure there ?
---
And here I was expecting battleships to spawn and blap you.

You don't need to be in a pod. I do it in supers all the time.
---
Okay, I'll bite now.
---
So far we have reported over 500 compromised bot tokens we have found directly to the engineering team at Discord so that they can be revoked.

And even though what you are claiming is actually impossible (and I would know, I wrote it), and I should write you off as some sort of nutjob, please feel free to forward any sort of anonymized proof of this claim to ozzeh AT pleaseignore.com and I will personally see that they are removed from this alliance immediately.

That is, if you aren't just talking out of your ass like I expect you are.

LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE PROVE IT
---
Welcome to EVE joe! Some people do have fun doing that, and even if it sounds boring to you imagine what would feel like spending twice as much time sitting in station waiting for someone else to tell you that you can actually start playing the game because the fight is gonna happen, and that your game is restricted to hit "aproach", "jump" and "F1"... surely spending half an hour to kill a cyno sounds almost appealing now.
---
Lol I bet they would.
---
Sounds like content to me, excellent 
---
sadly not all corps operate like this, but yes a decent corp shouldn't blame you for trying something new or even going somewhere else because it's not doing it for you ( wait that may sound wrong ). 
---
&gt; ...and make them target for safe sudden strikes with no possible escalations on timer.
---
No different than an offline starbase, really.
---
lol this guy
---
jesus thats some epic posting right there
---
only breaking a few laws is fine
---
Outlaws. are associated with HOSA but in an attempt to pretend that they're not entirely reliant on Papa Holesale for evictions, they target the small groups that can't defend themselves, rather than ever attempting to take a challenge.
---
INIT. had it wrong the whole time.
---
TEST IT doesn't store passwords in plain text and wouldn't be able to see any of your other passwords. So even if you're dumb enough to use the same password everywhere nobody would have access to that. 
---
In the event you do have any actual proof I'd encourage you to send it to Ozz who replied to you. Or you know, stop making up things you have no understanding of.
---
That fit ))
---
I don't think code ganks ventures,  but I could be wrong.
---
The term "Boosh" was applied to MJFG slightly before WWB in my belief this was around the time INIT had started using "snatch Fleet" and was royally fucking fleets up. First time I heard it and used it from there on was when a (non native English speaking) friend of mine who has terrible acronym pronunciation used "boosh". We all laughed and used it there on in but by no means was it the origin of the term (I don't think) but it's as close to the origin as I can put it.
---
3rd Party Fun Roam Anyone?
---
oh no, oh noooo

&gt;Not only do WE recommend all of our members use 2FA (we've sent at least two broadcasts about it so far this week), we have also reported over 500 compromised bot tokens we have found directly to the engineering team at Discord so that they can be revoked.
---

They do. Gank Atrons or "another Catalyst/Thrasher/Coercer". Mostly to "make an example".

Where did he say they broke the law? 
---
It wasn’t a big deal, but I’ve had a lot cheaper free trips in my day. 
---
It's not exactly good gameplay and not the goal of roaming, but pretty standard, that's why roaming in the traditional sense is dead and many prefer rolling nullsec statics in wormholes. In more busy areas of space smth will usually jump to that cyno to kill you.
---
There are still ppl like me that enjoy it tho, taking 40 gates with 2 accounts is almost like meditating, but most players prefer mining.
---
Getting a fight started is an art that takes many years to learn, but is impossible to master. Try holding the VNI for 30min if he doesn't eject/selfdestruct. 
---
Why? 
---
I have a few ideas about it but can someone please tell me straight up what is the use of the smartbomb in this fit?

Just a fun roam. 2 friends and I were popping NS frig holes and happened to come out in TEST space. I found a ratting domi and tackled it. The domi pilot warps in a 2nd domi to fight our 3 frigates. We end up getting both domis while losing a retribution and my worm was pushed to the limit! https://zkillboard.com/related/30003130/201901150100/ I was surprised at the lack of response from test since the fight took a while, but it seems they were occupied elsewhere that day. The domi pilot admitted after that he derped and forgot enough fuel for his cyno, and then he showed me what he meant. https://imgur.com/a/8Q1wtEU Good fight!
---
Who cares? For a sandbox game Eve players (read: forum / reddit users) spend an awful lot of time worrying about what other people are doing. 
---
Show me on the doll where Doomchinchilla touched you.
---
listen, slow down and clean the spittle off your chin before speaking again.   I never claimed they exploited their way out.  They were stuck for a week, and if it wasnt a massive blow please tell me what they did to TEST after that.  Let me help you fucking nothing.  
---
Did you sell it via contract in Dodixie? If so I'm the guy that bought it an hauled it to perimeter to sell for an extra 100mil!

if he has access to TQ he has access to reddit.
---
 This makes no sense. They **tried** to invade their pets.
---
Looks like they just did something last night
---
Outlaws whole shtick was been to eventually get big enough to evict the few remaining larger western wh groups. They continually evict smaller entities across high class and low class. They disrupt more than their fare share beginner corporations causing further stagnation in wormholes. I’m not one to tell people how they should play their game but I’m happy this is happening.
---
inside it, clearly
---
The Loki has spare utility highslots but not much fitting room left, the smartbomb is usefull against drones, esp ECM ones, an alternative would be a probe launcher or a small neut on top of that medium one against tacklers that get a scram.
---
Naw, I left it blank.

Won't work as he'll warp off when you log on (unless you figure out his timer and time it really well). You could just anchor a bubble to solve this issue.

well then our situation *must* have been an anomaly. They came to use told us they were taking us out and offered to be bribed out. 5B. We didnt have money like that we grinded our asses off to get where we were. We voted and grinded more and paid. Then they evicted us anyways. We were a pretty small group in a c2. I'm 100% sure i wasn't the only one. My first sentence was obv. sarcasm.
---
Not so much, it was more surprise that PLNC didn't come this time what with Fafer's money.

Kinda not anymore, they had a interleadership quarrel and split up  after they lost their last home.

Dude I've flown with them for a long time. They evict wormholes. And [they roll null](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcX-aYPeExtAJfMgVwsYnGQ). They lived together with IH for a long time. They still hunt in null time to time.
---
Evictions are hard work. And it's easy to come back from one. If any wh group that "creates content" leaves wormholes because they are evicted, then they should not live in wormholes anyway. That's the wh reality. People should have a plan for eviction. At the worst they can always logoff in freighters.
---
hmm. It tells me I do when i try to moveme in a ship maybe its a bug, fuck it ill just do like everyone else.

Raw member count doesn't mean anything and anyone worth their salt knows that. When Panfam and pets tried to evict the south, Legacy teaming up with goons put them on a (relatively) level playing field regarding supers and titans.
---
If raw manpower determined power projection, panfam+pets would have never tried to "evict" Legacy in the first place lmfao. They knew they had cap superiority, went with it, and started REEING the second the fight evened out.
---
You're better off trying to spin newer events than written history, just saying.
---
i was told they are called "booshers" beacuse of the noise the MJD makes
---
:thinking:
---
This is real? Amazing!
---
thank you, friend!  I suspected it could ve been used as a firewall (but there were too little lokis so how?) or something to fuck interdiction probes with ( but damage is too low for that) .    
---
thanks for clearing it up !
---
That's some elite wormholer entitlement complex right there.
---
Not everyone's reason for existence in the wh space is elite prearranged medium fleet warfare. These people are average/bad pvpers. They like to blob evict others. They like to hunt in nullsec. They don't have to feed you ships whenever you roll in their wh.
---
If you don't like them, and you can evict them, evict them. I'm just pointing out the dogshit logic in elite wormholer entitlement people are using to justify evicting them. Nobody needs a justification for evictions. If they were so bad, then we would nag CCP to make them harder. They aren't bad.
---
nice dude, keep it coming

Yeah, I thought you were just doing a tl;dr for me. Didn't realize you were another of the nuthuggers.

Actually no. Right now it is probably 33% US 66% EU.

sick burn kendarr, have you been busy coming up with it for the last month in fdz?
---
Maybe you and sue abbot could anchor some more citadels and make us form
---
Don't forget null, the safest space of all. 
---
I know it sounds like that, but actually no.  A month or two ago, someone also said something similar - "HK evicted us, we quit the game/wormhole space forever, etc etc."  Once we got some more info and could check it out on Zkill, it turns out an HK fleet wrecked dude's corp in a fight, then a week later, some other bigger group evicted them.  This all happened 5+ years ago, so the guy only remembered it as "HK evicted us."  
---
I dunno, is it? 
---
+1 for it being outside the super umbrella?

You seem perturbed.

Well, congrats on winning eve. Hope all goes well for you.

ccp is to blame for that as nobody has the server source and it all has to be reverse engineered and CCP's code is a fucking mess, its like open heart surgery w/ construction cranes 
---
Not sure what you're trying to convince me of. He asked a question and I answered it.
---
In FW lowsec, I see a lot of jackdaws and the like running missions. I know if you warp to the beacon you land on a gate - what’s behind it, as in heavy NPCs I’d need to tank as well as the jackdaw? Would a cloaky ship work, as in can I be cloaked within the mission site?
---
Or any recommendations for trying to pvp these guys? 
---
Cheers
---
I thought it was obvious as well :shrug:
---
And I'm making an observation based on that answer. I'm not trying to convince you of anything.
---
The new tracking accuracy number is twisting my melon, has anyone got a cheat sheet or a magic equation you can pop the new numbers through see how the relate to the old ones?
---
id think its to get small ec- drones off. they orbit crazy close and have very little hp. ec- light drones are also a common last resort for tackled ratters

no, cause am real friend.

Pretty bold move to not put a cynojammer on field, but okay I guess.
---
Bullshit change. Also bullshit to cover it up in patch notes with generic 'making new eden a safer place' message. 
---
If there was an exploit involving booshing, it should have been handled differently. This reminds me of CCPs initial proposal to fix HICs except this time they didnt tell anyone first.
---
so PGL should have been a better FC and not paraded into that meat grinder.

that's how you were going to end that thought, right?

By now, you shoulda' learned to pilot aaaa teng-goooo!

Quite new, less than 24 hours in (but climbing quickly!)

Have a shield regenerator, but during missions I keep getting damaged to the point of the hull taking hits. Thus far I keep going back to my home station for repairs, surely there is a faster way (especially when the location involves several Stargates).
---
Advice or tips? Thanks!
---
Best post even, keep on keeping on.
---
Man. Their is alot of spicy WHer drama in here
---
Much like the stabber fleet last time against TEST caps. I don't think anyone there survived, but it sure did what it was supposed to
---
I was going to post this
---
\&gt; implying anyone in TEST IT knows how IT works either
---
Sov null is safer than high sec.
---
Not at all. Call it like I see it, whether you agree or not means fuck all to me. Notice the lack of shit talk here from NC? You know why? They have a little class, even though they're enemies. It honestly surprised me when I met them at Eve Vegas. PL never had class and has been cancer for the game for years. It's obvious to anyone whose paid attention for years. I don't have a habit of hiding my dislike for people. If that's too much for your virgins ears, reevaluate your life.
---
The game literally throws free Ventures at you when you start.
---
That would make their pilots pooftas

Honestly, if you need isk / membership now, get it.

Auto refreshing d-scan? Like ranges will change all the time, people appear on d-scan just to be gone the next second and so on. Having a "snapshot" of your d-scan is way better in my book.

If I fit a warp core stabilizer, can I jump out of a bubble, or are those just for negating points and scrams?
---
I thought code died about 3 years ago. 
---
and thats why you are such a shit FC
---
meme arrow
---
The latter. No amount of WCS will save you from a bubble of any kind.
---
Yeah, I was going off the comment not the context. My bad. 
---
In terms of 2012 and earlier gsmeplay: carriers and dreads are the new cruisers, supers the new battle cruisers and titans they new battleships. A little more than a dime a dozen at this point.
---
By your own definition, does your reddit posting also make you a classless cancer then?
---
Well i joined a corp called bootstrap mining and they're situated in NS. I was going to think to move to low sec, i spent most my time in low / null &amp; thera when i last played. I'm not scared of it, i just don't know if i can fly anything that can deal with the PVE sites.
---
I dont doubt it, but does that make them any worse than the northern blue donut? 
---
i think that's already possible, though i haven't looked closely at that myself
---
I cancelled my volunteer application and told our head coach I was sitting this year out. 
---
You clearly haven't met many people in PL then...
---
Thanks for the info,  i joined a corp called bootstrap mining and they're situated in NS. I was thinking of maybe upgrading to omega so i can start using the Mallar to fight combat sites around the area. I didn't know you get such lucrative drops. I've mainly got around 250k per refuge i was doing in HS including salvaging. 
---
yo yo tama?
---
what do i do
---
please tell us more about how totally not mad you are, a few more posts like this will convince us
---
You definitely don't sound mad. Just casual unhinged ranting :) 
---
pot meet kettle 
---
I do believe the bots are fucking the game right now
---
Yeah, we're swimming in LPs in FW, even on the losing side, and you can buy 500 datacores for like 20m ISK and 20000 LP I think? Something like that.
---
A bubble will prevent any jump-drive capable ship from jumping out, regardless of the ships warp-strength...
---
Warp Core Stabilizers only effect the warp-strength of a ship, for the purpose of "negating points scrams" as you stated.
---
I applaud the thought but worry you may be training your daughters to be arrested for assault. Girls tend to bully verbally, not physically, and you can’t just administer a beat down to someone because of what they said to you, as much as I would wish it so in many cases.
---
You can lockdown BPOs in a Corp Hangar but Directors/Shareholders can unlock them so unless you run the corp (or don't mind having your stuff nicked) it'll end in tears.
---
you can repair at any station that has repair facilities - don't need to go to your home station
---
but Chester quit wh0re doesn’t exist anymore idiot!!!
---
orly? I dont follow them super closely, only what I hear in corp chat ect. 
---
They are all still roaches tho.
---
That was supers/ titans vs supers/ titans. The dreads really just shot each other predominantly. 
---
The middle one is the best value.

must be why Elo dumpsters you every time you decide to fight him.

Go back to Sehmosh where my best journey started, with a small group of miners. Dock my Tristan, Stratios, and Asteros there, roll and Orca out, and go out how I came back into New Eden. Boosting away for all to enjoy. Telling dirty jokes in local.

How is us breaking them out 'cheating their way out.' Are you upset because you were out there in a hauler tending to the bubbles?

u guys talked shit then got stomped, ofc people are gonna haze u a little

Good moves can definitely respect it. Go after those opportunists so it doesn’t happen again. Then make a play for delve.

You are probably taking damage that your ship isn't resistant to. Shields are bad against EM and Thermal. Do you have something like a EM Ward amplifier or Anti-EM shield rig on your ship? Also, you might be using a race that isn't shield driven, like Amarr. If you could tell us what ship and fitting you have, we could help you out a little more
---
Thats not whats killing wormhole space.
---
Whats killing wormhole space is up and coming wormhole corp leaders fall in love with the big groups, leave and join them and eventually without leadership the corp dwindles and dies.
---
&gt; They have a little class, even though they're enemies. 
---
your boys have been talking smack without taking a breath since UALX lmao, and you, Valk, are such a fucking embarrassment even your _own alliance members_ want you to spare them from the triggerkitten, actually fucking painful posts you vomit out - let alone being such a shitweasel you stand out from the rest of the cesspool that is /r/eve
---
but haha u BAITED us on ur epic posts right?? haha pl salt mined xd!
---
&gt; Raw member count doesn't mean anything and anyone worth their salt knows that.
---
TEST had more active players as well.
---
&gt;Legacy teaming up with goons put them on a (relatively) level playing field regarding supers and titans.

Legacy had parity in UALX without CFC

Not your bad, that was my comment about your shitpost unrelated to eve. Half of it being part of tldr I guess.

The rmt war?

You can fit a shield booster, armor repairer, or hull repairer to regenerate lost shield/armor/hull HP. Be aware that specific ships are geared towards tanking one of shield or armor with hull tanking being a niche usually used in pvp. Check your ship bonuses and check out https://zkillboard.com/ to see how others are fitting the same ship.
---
No , but I wish he had.
---
imagine thinking a guy botting cares if people hunt him. you realize he can replace his shit in 1-2 days of botting?
---
Much like you, there is no point to this thread's existence
---
Ah James 315, makes sense why you are quitting... o boy....

Fuck I love it when people add comms into videos, most eve stuff is unwatchable without it tbh.

you can (could) even /moveme capitals into HS 
---
My only piece of advice is don't mine. You will very quickly lose interest in the game if that's the only thing you do.
---
yeah, why do you think he cyno'd in to a covert cyno lit at a safe in the same vector as the previous site the super warped from? and why do you think the hunter got fleet warped? 
---
Why don't you come evict us from Fountain
---
Stealing other people’s work and passing it off as your own. Typical politician. 
---
Vpns exist
---
Depends entirely on the site they are running. You can google the name of the site you warped to and find what kind of rats are in the site.
---
If you get targeted by rats you wont be able to cloak so generally cloaking inside isnt the best idea, if you can fly recon ships like a curse you won't be seen on dscan and can sneak up on them.

I want to see a video of you Extract them all them and right click trash it all. All that glorious SP.

Yeah. I'm a 'miserable old man' remember? :) PL desperate for morale  victory you've been looking for since you welped 1 trillion in D-G and failed in Provi, Catch, Tenerifis.

I can't believe my dumb comment is getting so many upboats.

The good:
---
* Relevant comms included, adds to the overall experience
---
* Music isn't overbearing and definitely adds to the pacing of the video
---
* No ridiculous amount of "OPSEC" black boxes
---
The bad:
---
* C'mon dude, it's 10 minutes of pushing F1. Yes it was a megadunk, yes PanFam outplayed TEST &amp; Friends. However, not every fight like this makes for an amazing narrative video (narrative meaning telling a story, like a narrative essay). Certain shots would be much better as a cinematic video for an overall defense of Geminate propaganda video though, so food for thought.
---
forgot the /s, thought it was obvious, since I usually get blamed for being pro north or some shit like that
---
On personal experience, blaster hecate/eris xtreme dps fits only work in gates when the target lands right next to you and aggros first.
---
Or, of course, with bubbles and have target land on edge right next to you.

---
We're not down here for good fights. And we don't care about if pgl or vily thinks we're blobbing. They've talked so much shit about PL and how we aren't committed to our deployments and how TEST is this battle hardened group. Well we're here to tell them to nut up or shut up. They're going to be homeless soon.

Post a screenshot of every system you roam showing 50% botters then. Easy enough for you, you're the man. Just imagine how great it would be to wipe the shit-eating-grin off my face when you prove that 50%. Go on, do it.

What in the fuck are you talking about wh0re?
---
Unless someone took the same ticker as my long long dead c5 corp/alliance.
---
Why exactly is this individual possibly sweaty?
---
wh0re hasn't been around for like 4 years now :P
---
so im assuming theyre running lv3 or 4 with a jackdaw (else its overkill). Its not easy to tank anything in those missions but if youre in something fast/small you can probably sig tank. 
---
Ive seen people using a ceptor for the tackle + then blobbing you with 2 - 3 appropriate counter ships. Your best bet is to tackle the jackdaw on the entrance gate in which case a VNI should melt it. 
---
Be aware that jackdaws for those missions are often extra range fit and can hit at 90+kms. They tend to be decently fast and apply well too.
---
But what if they added a graphic effect to show the cloud dissolving when depleted
---
...so we broke the law of not encouraging people to use 2fa?  
---
3.5 bil?!!! surely you man 3.5 mill
---
I’m going to go a different route than most. Personally I play this game for different reasons to most. I can see the allure of someone wanting to undock a mining ship, and hang on coms with people. It’s virtually stress free other than your occasional suicide ganker or roam through your respective class of system. It’s okay they are advertising to another type of crowd other than a pvp crowd. Personally I play this game for the community and my wh Corp gives me that. I try not to judge people to heavily maybe they want to spend an hour talking to some people and mine something to have a stress free life. Maybe they have an psychical impairment to where they can’t reliably operate their ship in a combat perspective other than Ctrl left click hit F1. Let people mine if they want I guess is what I’m trying to say.
---
The fit is just max dps everything. Either your target evoparates before they can fire back or you die.
---
ironically mining and crafting are the two things you cannot do effectively at all with a free account
---
is this... the final evidence that CCP has not logged into their video game recently?
---
Oh wow, did not know that! Rock on EUtz
---
Hey, I appreciate it! Thank you!!
---
I would also encourage any current, former, or non-member of TEST to enable 2fa.
---
Not for your paranoid delusion reasons, but still a good idea.
---
All those alphas in Kelvala. 
---
\&gt; we normally dont do this sort of stuff under supercap umbrellas 
---

&gt; without giving your esi
---
I guess horde is recruiting?
---
That would be an easy way for any long time investment camper to actually catch them. The super/carrier bots under slyce in deklein just move to another system in another pipe or they stop "working" for the night/day. (According to the rmt botting farm boss botting is work for them) Disclaimer: I haven't spent much time researching them after not being blue to them anymore so take this info with a grain of salt. I also couldn't really look at them during their prime time zone which is somewhere between 21:00 - 09:00
---
It dont say they are bad or we are good. Panfam was big blue donut in 2016. Goons/TAPI is big blue donut in 2019.
---

Go roam urself and watch those bots. Why should i waste my time.

That was nothing we claimed and nothing to do with our reason for the expedition. It began and ended with "because it was there".

watching this....i'm reminded of fish in the water with some shark or something just swimming through eating with wild abandon as the fish have no where to go.
---
You still haven't backed up your claim that 50% of Delve are botting. That's why you should go waste your time so you can prove to everyone that you're not full of shit.
---
best afk income. combat booster gas huffing
---
The trick is to camp all systems they can profitably use to bot. The new thing I am trying is to bring a dozen Lokis and ship swap them around to different alts to have some fun when the botmasters go to sleep.

They needed botters in esoteria

First glimpse I thought this was the new stellaris banner ad.

tfw fc tells you to shoot dreads sorted a to z and you spend 10 minutes shooting them by distance instead

tfw you upload a video of it

tfw you post that video to reddit for everyone to see

Nope.

Sure, but not through a Galaxy Pack.

Uhh. Would love to help around with that

So your saying just him logging in is bad not that hes actually using input broadcasting in the game AFTER he logs in. But just logging in?

---
Whats your point? I dont get where you wanna go with this since it has zero to do with the subject.
---
&gt; No ridiculous amount of "OPSEC" black boxes
---
some people actually give a shit about opsec, and opsec has its merits
---
that said, opsec censoring videos isn't actually gonna make a huge difference in horde anyway since just about any information you could gather from a video, you could just as easily gather by just being in the fleet and on comms
---
for groups that aren't horde though, there are merits
---
sure. you seem to be mad about CODE, what gives?

It's a game.

mate there's nothing important that others don't already know in your channels, especially after the fact. maybe some super secret FC coordination thingy sure, but in default alliance/corp/fleet chats, meh.
---
No. They've conceded defeat in High Sec and are seeing if the bots in Null are less advanced.
---
That and its a WH group using the harmless alliance tag as a ticker tank.
---
Polarized hecate fit is straightforward: polarized guns and max damage upgrades. Works great for killing anything, as long as it doesnt shoot back; if it does shoot back, better hope it dies real fast
---
&gt; Ah ok so someone told you to go play on an interstate, which tbh is  probably a great idea, so you begged for CSM votes and threatened us the  rest of the night cause you have nothing better to do? lol k. 
---
Those are your cringy words and foolish claims, not mine. You really don't know how the internet works do you? I can see all the things you said in this thread, everybody can. The "*I know you are but what am I!?*" gimmick is just pathetic. Maybe if you had the self awareness and memory of at least a goldfish you would have noticed Initiative moving assets into RAGE. I think I am starting to see how this happened. Initiative isn't gifted or skilled, Hard Knocks is just full of people like you who can't even remember what they said 20 mins ago.   
---
Everything I post is related to EVE. 
---
He asked who you were since your name was deleted in the original thread that was posted.
---
Because they probably believe there are more engaging elements of the game that produce much more exciting, innovative, and immersive gameplay and think it is funny that there is an advertisement highlighting one of the least developed (at least mechanically) and in the eyes of some - the most boring - part of the game. The fact that it's a sandbox means you can do whatever you want. That doesn't mean that people don't have opinions about the things other people are doing.
---
We call it the Casino War now.
---
I see what they're doing, and I understand who this would appeal to as well.  
---
To sort of tag onto your questions, I sincerely wonder how this kind of ad is supposed to help CCP in the current MMO climate. I mean I'm sure *some level of research* was involved in deciding to run this particular marketing campaign, but when the top end of the market is exclusively action packed, fast paced games it does make you wonder how many people this will actually reach.
---
There is no need to go back to the lower level missions. 
---
You'll want to graduate past a Velator pretty quickly. For Gallente, a Tristan is a good ship for learning some basics. That, plus the other recommendations above, should help you get your feet under you.
---
Thats cool but what does it have to do with this subject ?
---
stop doing beer on fleets, lane xD
---
[https://imgur.com/zlzWGID](https://imgur.com/zlzWGID)
---
Great, thank you. Now that I've done some basic research yes it seems like my options are limited with this ship. Appreciate the feedback!
---
Hi. You sound mad. Are you mad? Please tell my virgin ears how mad you are?
---
I think I read an interview from years ago where a CCP official said "You want to run your own Eve server? Go ahead and try!" it was a nod not only to the messy code, but also to the server hardware requirements.
---
In what way is a shitpost about baseball related to a spaceship game.
---
The market that is not being catered to, and that EVE used to cater to until years of suicide ganking in high sec drove it out, is the people who enjoy sci-fi stories and want to play a video game in which they take a role in one.... but who have no interest in doing what some cunt FC says or logging on when he demands.
---
It is the mindset for some, you're definitely right
---
I'm sorry, I should have clarified. I don't, and my group doesn't, operate that way, with demanding feed tribute. I hate feed tribute, but more I hate the lack of self respect and lack of desire to become something better shown by groups who offer feed tribute. Groups who dock and log are dogs who show their belly, but there's always *something* you can do against an aggressor. Even if all you do is frustrate them, do something. 
---
So that's what I mean, really. If you cannot think of anything in the entire toolbox of game mechanics to do to stand up for yourself and your guys and the space you call your own, then you should not be allowed to call it yours
---
Read it again. 
---
&gt;TEST blobbed up hard to win against a significantly smaller force it’s fine to admit that
---
and I completely agree it's fine to admit that. I'd argue it's a good thing in terms of force projecting.
---
&gt;Legacy had parity in UALX without CFC
---
Fake fucking news. According to the BR, WITH goons, PL and pets had 9 more titans, and 85 more supers. Legacy obviously had more dreads from the dreadbombs. That's all with goons. Consider your point nullified.
---
It's really nice the north is taking it seriously this time
---
Yes I did mention that. Except in rare cases they dscan before they warp and go elsewhere if there's a bubble on dscan. Hence why I said both. 
---
If I was your friend I would tell you to shut the fuck up and stop embarrassing yourself.
---
You guys need new material.
---
Do you English? 
---
"Im quitting Eve, but wait..lemme spend time digging through zkill about my concerns, etc."
---
Delve would be full of mining barges watched over by a supercapital fleet.
---
Armor got to do it last time. Lets do the shield this time.
---
You heard the man. Never ever waste time in highsec. There are always better ways of making isk outside highsec, which will be your main concern at the beginning. 
---
Inb4 input broadcasting bombers wipe an entire belt ;)
---
wow, going after snuff dreads specifically. very rude.
---
Largely the same, just slower. We in GSF started transitioning to mining not because rorquals became a thing, but because carriers stopped being able to AFK rat. Mining was the next best AFK PVE thing to do in sovereign nullsec. 
---
nah, the reactions are just too much fun. Thanks, though. 
---
Suicide ganking in Hisec has been around for over a decade. Even during the height of the games popularity, suicide ganking was actually easier than it is now and was much more prevalent. I might be confused about what timeline you're describing but I should also add that suicide ganking still exists and I'm fairly certain this ad is more generally speaking in terms of ore mined in Nullsec.
---
Who mines in a barge?
---
the reason you think that is because pl has decent opsec
---
How about that all your cult followers think they own high sec but can't police it? Or the fact your doctrine reads like one that would be given to you when joining The People's Temple, Branch Davidians, or Heavens Gate....here have some kool aid.
---
Luckily you've got no leadership to lose 
---
This is Eve, Not a talent show! 
---
For PvE with Gallente you really want to go Tristan &gt; Algos &gt; Vexor &gt; Dominix and then look at other options such as faction ships.

Yeah i told a friend of mine to just pod jump to our nullsec base as soon as he completed the tutorial. You’ll literally get a free barge or exhumer, a couple of frigates, all fitted out. Why stay in high sec?
---
More likely because it’s a slow night and no one likes sitting around with nothing to do. Ventures explode as well as any other ship.
---
I didn't even look for his name because I figured nobody would be that tarded
---
I was wrong thx bud
---
You should read it again. By the same standards posting some internet shitpost unrelated to this subreddit and adding an in-game ship name at the end or a copy paste of some in-game text doesn't make the shitpost relevant.
---
Don't forget them hitting hk farms and expecting that to be forgotten. The fuck did they expect 
---
We're all having fun then!
---
I posted a video a few months back, wasn't anything special, just some lowsec frigate stuff. 
---
I'm also not saying it has to be clarion call or anything like that, just some more effort than that one dabbing skeleton shit that was posted, or the generic 3x sped up F1 blob shooting another F1 blob. They are boring and add nothing at all.
---
I liked this video but it was too long for what it was.
---
thanks
---
and if post-its are too complicated, ingame notepad works really well
---
Rather than splitting tank you could also just bring a mobile depot with you, deploy it at a safe &amp; bookmark it and use that to refit / store stuff. You could just bring it with you to the mission sites and deploy them there as well, but that's up to you. You can use this to refit off of and thus put on  a rep module of the correct type.
---
More realistically though you probably just have a problem with your fit or ship choice.
---
Been seeing this ad everywhere, makes me cry a little on the inside
---
you're not in nood, stop posting

Tapirs are possessed of famously large dongers.

I cannot believe that wasn't a lead up to a Fresh Prince copypasta.

Are there even moderators in this subreddit?  Sure doesn't seem that way.

Can we get this garbage removed from this subreddit? This has nothing to do with EVE and only encouraged this sort of garbage.

It's so much easier to kill a few barges than kill a single rorq. 
---
How many barges you wager you can take out before the supers drop?
---
They took that system from us just last week. We were in the process of moving in.

We still have it seeded, and were going to wait for them to get complacency before attempting to fight back.

That one of like 3 different adds i've seen recently, the others all involved PVP ships.
---
Yes, Phoenix need to die off so they can buy a real dread. 
---
not nearly enough people for a mining rule awox, usually its everyone logged in who sees the ping.
---
You need to be there to manage fighters or they're not very effective and also they'll die a lot
---
What about shitty wannabe skrillexs tho?
---
10 was a bit of a shitshow :(
---
That is legal Harly, but are we now saying Mar5hy had an error I haven't seen anyone bitch about for quite some time? You know if folks are losing settings again you would see posts on that. The guy input broadcasts. He got caught. It is time for CCP to take action.
---
The better question is are they going to be looking at another "Alpha Expansion" of sorts... that will flop hard same way Resource Wars did. Gotta try tempting those players into mining to inject more Orcas/Rorqs!
---
This is only the start [BIG DROPS IN COMING](https://i.imgur.com/WAbBe8y.png) I probably should update my screenshot, guess I will keep you all guessing what I have planned for you all..

---
It's actually pretty hard to bomb miners, they're usually spread out too far. Could torp them but would only get a couple before the others escape. 
---
Wow lots of conflicting arguments here especially with regards to null blocks. I personally recommend and second eve university. Thats what i did for my first couple months. They have campuses in high, low, null, and whs so you can experience everything. Through it all i found i enjoyed defending local space, group roams, missioning, contract trading, importing, and exploring. I also found out that i didnt like mining, solo/small gang pvp, buying overpriced items from smaller markets, jumping between low populated systems lookong for all the pieces for a fit, and wardec ganking. That was how after about 4 months i decided a null bloc was right for me. Brave space has so much content flowing through it all the time you can decide if you want to hunt enemy explorers, enemy fleets will come through sometimes 10 enemies, sometimes 200. Sometimes they are in caps, sometimes they are in subcaps, sometimes they camp gates, sometimes they attack your infrastructure. You can do all of it, none of it, or choose the fleets that fit your playstyle. If null politics is your thing you can join strat ops but youre not required to. Brave doesnt care about killboards lile some groups do so if whelping blingy ships is fun for you like it is for me you can do that too without worrying about getting berated by leadership. If you want a red killboard above all else you can find  groups for that too. Both the noob friendly null blocks and ece university will provide you will all the skillbooks and beginner ships you need, have buybacks to easily and safely monetize your salvage/loot/ore/whatever, amd offer classes on lots of topics. Smaller FW and WH corps may or may not provide all, some, or none of that. Lastly if money is an issue for you enjoy the f2p until you find one of the dlc packs on a 50% off sale somewhere, but if you have a disposable income the $15/mo is very worth it as this game is by design very long and drawn out, so the double training speed will have you experiencing much more of the game much faster. I highly advise against trying to grind pit omega each month with isk as it will prohibit you from trying as many areas of the game, and the better money making activities like incursions or carrier ratring wont be available to you for many months so you will be doing low sp activities for less money and will get burned out. Once youve played the game for a while and understand the ways you can make the billions of isk needed to stay omega and be self sufficient with only a few hours of gameplay you can put the credit card away. Good hunting! 
---
This has to do with the fact that, given your previous posting, its clear that you live in a fantasy realm that has very little to do with how eve is actually played today. That being the case I thought it best to illustrate your utter lack of relevant thought processes, thus saving others the tedium of actually reading your comments.
---
Just doing my civic duty :)
---
Better tattoo that on your arm so you don't forget in 20 mins. 
---
I remember those in 7RM. "What a second...did he just boosh that guy from the gate?" or their infamous double boosh. Pretty amazing to see but absolute cancer to fight. You needed scrams on everything to counter it.
---
Then there was this time where we were fucking around the gate, and 5 different booshers activated staggered and the whole fleet bounces all around the gate and then lands directly on it. Was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in this game.
---
Good times.
---
Hasnt happened in awhile but talking about the ui brough back ptsd
---
what. like a moros?  lol
---
honestly, only Nag and Rev are in good positions atm.
---
Moros and Phoenix. bit niche to subpar.  phoenix with missile travel time and application.  moros with its range issues

How deep does it go...we on to something boys.
---
At least we had chat windows that worked....
---
friendly reminder that your group has more supers/titans than our group
---
Feels like it. Even a total retard is 100% safe in delve if they fit a cyno.
---
It's pretty much impossible to prevent a super from killing an inhib unless you're a large blob, because lol inhib tank
---
And the second they light a cyno, 20 fax appear and it's over. Even the most retarded of pilots are safe, unless they forget how to light a cyno
---
Carrier can make bit more than AFK rorqual, simply is cheaper.      
---
It also require a lot more clicking - aka your mouse will hate you after 1st hour.         
---
You control all fighter moves - and guess what - they stop after each command and die to rats pretty fast.          
---
From PVP perspective they are good at dropping on Sutionia thanks to amount of salt they are generating. 
---
Sounds good :P
---
I think he's talking about the legendary Blue Eyes White Cena
---
[depends how you do it](https://youtu.be/u1Lc9rEKF_4?t=116)
---
Number one thing is russian control over nearly half of null has collapsed.  only a couple regions that one could consider russian, and most of those are renter based with non-Russian overlords.
---
August/september 2018 there was something that approached a world war.  ~100 titans died in a month, with the worst losses going to Northern Coalition and Darkness.
---
Triumverate and Legion of XiX both lost significant numbers of titans during ambushed move ops.
---
Never have I been more happy to see our enemy’s winning some fights. 
---
We were sorta worried we broke you for a bit there :/
---
Like a kid that broke his favourite toy, it was getting kinda depressing.

Oh yes, I understand that hehe.  I think I have a character or two that are still at the default because I don't use them often and just got tired of fixing them.
---
Nice editing. Could've left the music out of it.
---
It has plenty to do with EVE. If you don't like it, read something else. Jesus, you guys are such crybabies. 
---
Your mom.
---
Happens more than you think......

Why don't we just call this what it really is, Coalition of the North vs Coalition in the south. One side is trying to build the blue donut, the other to prevent it.

Where's the shit flinging I'm used to? Do I have to sort by controversial?

---
I do agree with you that people shouldn't feel the need to feed ships to a superior entity, and some of the bushido 'justification' is pretty self-serving. But targeting growing groups for evictions is directly working against a healthy J space and that *is* a justification to me.
---
Very cool
---
They don't die as fast as you think. As long as you clear frigates they pretty much don't take damage if they're firing/moving the whole time. They can even survive the bombs from fighter bombers so long as they don't MWD...
---
well... cyno inhibs look good on paper, but most of the time they're really impractical
---
username checks out
---
Sure buddy
---
Well 53% of the total damage is from a clone soldier, which hit pretty hard.
---
Polarized - https://zkillboard.com/kill/69290347/
---
A good implant to get is SH-603. 3% hybrid turret damage and should be under 5m. 
---
The above fit in SS mode with the implant does 1153dps with Void. I also ran a Pyro Dose 3 which was 8-10m, is now 15m, so maybe drop to Dose 2 which is about 5m. You can also run an SS-902 with in another 2% for 9m (less worth it).
---
With the SH-603 and pyro you should be around 1200dps, depending on skills.
---
This is not the fit I would recommend though. While it is super fun to watch frigs just MELT, you have like 4k ehp, so you die to a breeze.
---
Normal - https://zkillboard.com/kill/73771412/
---
This is the fit I normally run. I friggin LOVE this ship. In propulsion mode it has a natural 2s align time (with perfect agility skills) which makes it very slippery for gate camps. You have combat probes to probe AFK ships or MTUs or combat probe an out gate to see if there is a gate gamp.
---
I run a pyro dose 2 and the sh-603 implant, which adds about 10m to the fit and gives me 69 extra dps. In SS mode you will have around 900 dps with drug and implants and almost 9k ehp.
---
As you can see, you have more than double the EHP of the polarized and are only packing 30% less dps. It's also much cheaper than polarized.
---
The dual web/scram means pretty much anything you catch you will have the control over and can use Void.
---
GL.
---
Depends on the rats, the faster cruiser rats will murder you and any ones with web bonuses are a pain, also Rat ewar.

Ohhh I'm sorry, I didn't know there were any rules to playing Eve nowadays.
---
I think you're just upset that there are people playing Eve who don't agree with your narrow minded, epeed fed bullcrap.... Someone tells you how to play and you play like you're told, you have no induvidual input, you rely on other people, 3rd party tools and a sense of pride that isn't your own.
---
You're like the wannabe kids that hang around the bully, trying to be part of the group so you don't get your teeth knocked out... that's what you're doing... and as soon as someone goes against the grain, or what you think is the grain, you lash out, because you have a big group behind you.
---
What INIT did to HK was glorious and it should have made HK members a bit more humble... but instead, here they are on Reddit, posting like nothing ever happened.
---
If HK was such a beloved entity, more effort would have been put in to help them and if HK was so good at what they do, they would have seen this coming... Heck man, HK even stated that they saw suspisous activity but did nothing to investigate... They were so high on themselves, too fat and too confident and too arrogant, thinking it could never happen to them.
---
That should have made them a bit more humble but instead, not a month later, they pick up their arrogant, thick headed attitudes again.
---
they are more likely to kick some random krab than your spy in my experience

---

---
Have another 42.0 from a poor noob.
---
I see evictions as part of the content wormholes supposed to provide. Being upset that a group keeps evicting people is similar to being upset that a group keeps killing Rorquals.
---
All this talk about bad guys and good guys is part of the propaganda/narrative that people use in part to gather other entities around themselves. It's bullshit though. Outlaws can't evict evictor entities themselves, because they are not at that caliber. If they could, maybe they would. HK can evict evictors, so uses it as a talking and advertisement point. Nobody caring about Russians also helps. If HK could only evict small entities, their leaders wouldn't back off just to protect wormhole content. HK probably had a way worse negative effect on the game by evicting drone lands renters. Those people were #1 source of everyday content for hunters, including myself. At the end of the day, nobody actually cares about being the good guy, nor they should. 
---
As for me I just see bullshit and I call. 
---
That’s actually a fantastic idea... I will look into it
---
hk evicted my will to live
---
We (PL) were calling them booshes on the first week of command destroyers being released and everyone messing around with them. I don't really remember if we ever used the term to refer to the battleship MJDs but it definitely caught on with us very early after the destroyers came out. Not claiming that we invented the term outright but we definitely helped it spread through the public-facing influencers we have, namely Elise and Doom.
---
Interestingly, at least on the AT team we use the term "blink" (from Dota) to refer to the single-target MJD beacons that are scattered around the arena instead of boosh. Makes more sense as a single-target module. 
---
I tend to also prefer payment I Gouda
---
It also doesn't even matter if you die.  It's almost impossible to lose a mining ship before you've paid it off, especially some place with so much good ore.  There's literally no reason most nullbloc ratters should be really shaking in their boots--at most, they might be a little annoyed at losing a day's work
---
Impose term limits on CSM members..1-2 terms max.. you can still have CCP feed off them from an alumni perspective but also ensures fresh blood moves its way in/out of the ecosystem.

Bunch of faggots don't fit a cyno even in delve.
---
Maybe check killboard of your targets first!  
---
If you proceed to fight a PvP-Combatpilot who is currently ratting prepare to get shit on and blopped by fuckton of titans and faxes.
---
If you attack a mining numbskull you get killmails like these:  
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/74492670](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74492670/) where the solo dreadnought who killed a rorqual had enough time to siege red and extract again.  
---
**what the fuck**
---
\- worst thing is I personally was in jumprange of that system and would have dropped by, if he had asked for help in fleet or spoken up in comms.
---
You can differentiate between PvPfags who are in fleet, are on comms and fuckwits who should die silent.  
---
One can call in cavalry within 10sec, the other one is fcking freeloot.  
---
You know it’s just a game, right?  Some of the most fun I’ve had has been cruising around in my ishkur baiting mission runners.  Other people gank.  It’s okay.  You don’t have to do it, but don’t hate people that find it fun.
---
I mean I don't know what you expected when you clicked on a video titled "269 Dreadnaughts" except a capital slugfest.
---
You make an excellent point.
---
yet delve had like 2T killed in december
---
Like you’ve ever been with a woman. 
---
no drones? maybe get some ecm or armor bots just for that extra help to jam/rep stuff?
---
I mean I still afk rat with heavy drones, just a vni
---
&gt; as nobody has the server source and it all has to be reverse engineered
---
Isn't that true for most if not all commercial MMOs? Or did the source code for something like World of Warcraft just leak at some point?
---
test fcs sound like tard wranglers lmao
---
Dumb enough to make it obvious? How else do you think these dunks are done? Everyone knows it’s blue eyes.
---
Ah yes December local was indeed shakey then, poor bots :(
---
Even Blizzard who is known to have a pretty aggressive legal team can't shut down development of World of Warcraft server emulators. It's not really a gray area at all.
---
As long as you don't distribute any of the original assets, you're fine. For an EVE server emulator that would mean that you can't pack the static database in your program and make your users get it themselves.

Nah Sort provides the Dreads for free!

I'd rather have Steadyo call me a cunt for the whole fleet than listen to PGL. 
---
Thats the joke?
---
Love it please make more videos :)
---
Simplefarmer flair complaining about people being risk averse...hmmm.. 
---
&gt; Being upset that a group keeps evicting people is similar to being upset that a group keeps killing Rorquals
---
No, an eviction is like razing a staging system and all its structures.

Not sure if you care, but I think you need to allow embedding.
---
is there any interest in taking on some presenters for these events?
---
Some people actually want to be the "good" guy, the same that some others actively try to be "bad" guys.  
---
World War Bee (or casino, or whatever you wanna call it) probably wouldnt have happened without justification, and people seeing themselves as the good guys, and the cfc as the bad guys.  
---
Who are you to try and dictate others how to play the game or feel about it, while simultaneously accusing others of doing the same?
---
goons jumping in their armor titans and supers was what pushed the node over and crash before DT so not really tbqh
---
We are so silent, our FC won’t even say GF in a reddit post. 
---
Baited
---
Is it possible to determine when a citadel that is becoming unanchored will actually finish its unanchoring timer? I Understand the process takes 7 days but hacking only gives the reinforcement timer, not when the structure will finish unanchoring. Is there some other way? Cheers
---
You died first because your the biggest threat
---
Can someone else confirm that (not sure when, maybe about 6 months ago) CCP changed the radius of the C320 cloud in the instrumental core reservoir from 55km to about 25km?
---
It basically ruined Jedi gas harvesting for me when they made this change. I stopped playing.
---
holy mother of god forgot how fucking bad it is listening to PGL.  Just screaming all fight.  Listen to a horde comms,  so much more calm straight to the point
---
only way to know w.o spies is to have actually seen it go into un anchor. and even then they could stop the un anchor in that week and restart it.
---
He was afk. That fit can tank a single dread. We had a good laugh about that - HK renters killing a rorq
---
But yeah, the rorq was 100% afk and got memed on. Didn't rep, didn't light. If he wasn't afk and asked for someone to light for him, he'd have lived. 
---
Did we just get the first non awox legit kill with all of the sexy faction titans 🤔
---
I didn't claim they were bigger? Learn to read...
---
NT TEST.

You'll gettem next time.

:sadpepe: Vanq DD cherry will wait another time....

22:54:48    Notify    'Gjallarhorn' Explosive Doomsday requires your ship to be loaded with Hydrogen Isotopes in order to perform this function. Unfortunately, a thorough search of your vessel failed to locate enough of the necessary fuel in a single stack.
---
That's exactly what I was doing in my head while typing.. Nice.
---
Yep and mentioning Legacy as a coalition instead of just Test means multiple alliances can use it.
---
And believe Brave probably will be sooner or later. 
---
Still waiting on the name of the Corp you were in when this happened.  I’d like to look it up on zkill. I’m happy to come back and post what I find.  
---
I use simpler farmers flair for the hell of it. I'm in a little wormhole corp, probably haven't heard of it. 
---
People just get irrationally angry at people over flairs 
---
[about that](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74561733/)
---
Totally using this one next time I get downvoted 
---
As someone who dual boxed capitals during the first HK eviction, in 2012, I concur. 
---
dude, wh btw, goons are good at what they do...organised game play,  wwb (all the big boys in eve) had their chance to kill them and they choose to blue ball their friends. stop whining and except that in what ever game design ccp implements goons will be on top of it!!! nothing to do with the game but everything with how they are organised. if you dont like it try do what they do and maybe you can fight them. another option move to wh space and try and finfd your space hapiness their. true you will not see your dumb name on a third party map but if your smart you can still call it home!
---
No Angel titan, not legit.
---
Wait shit, when did we deploy to Deklein?
---
Australia still love you conman and kelmac

---
What joke? I legit think Code is a cult but I do like reading the blog on idiots succumbing to their whim. Would I ever follow it? Hell no. Would I ever abide by their terms? In their dreams. But it does make for good comedy reading about the people who fall prey to it.
---
If you use logically invalid arguments to feel good about yourself, I can't tell you to not feel good, but I can tell you that your arguments are logically invalid.
---
WWB etc are different cases where I did not claim that there is a logically invalid argument. By "nobody caring about being the good guy" I should have clarified that I talk about wormhole space politics.
---
Shit flinging comes later typically from people who were not even there.
---
We also recruited Kreol Katashin, the absolute legend who killed a Nid, a Phobos and a Drec on a hostile keepstar in nothing but a gnosis. Such skill and mastery of the game could not possibly be contained in a single person.

Oh look, now he's a philosophizer

The hell did I just read
---
The game is highly imbalanced and ccps changes are bad. That's all I'm saying. It's not a grr goons fuck goons post, it's simply the way the game is. Same for eso, impass, etc. If you have a cyno, you're probably fine. 
---
I'm already in wormhole space, because I think it's dumb. The fact there's invulnerability in the game is very anti-eve, panic is terrible. The fact inhibs can't catch reps against a single super makes me sad. A retard super we tackled, who was almost dead, finally was told over comms to shoot the inhib and we couldn't keep it alive with staggered reps. Short of owning more caps (which a small corp won't, lmao) there's little that can be done once anyone lights a cyno within jump range. 
---
Wasn't it something like: Blood Union &gt; QEX &gt; Inner Hell &gt; OUTLAWS. They've been pretty consistent over the years of (regardless of their leadership) doing the same thing over and over, working closely with DURA LEXX and pretty much doing what they've always done since day one.
---
Probably almost fed the entire fleet with stupidity like f1'ing two dreads at once what the fuck???/
---
Considering you can just bomb them, unlike Rorquals.... potentially all of them lol.
---
It's like hearing someone complain the drill instructor is mean and scary, you should understand people volunteer to be in the realm underneath him and want that leadership. Would you rather have some mumbling weeb euro that can barely be understood? 
---
who
---
Feck yes I am.
---
Like there are rorquals without cyno &amp; coms, there will be barges in piles
---
Got to love the squared away calm FC’s, good job.
---
I'm just teasing steadyo about his 'smugarama' is all.
---
Did you cloak up within the same timeframe?  I know you had to be uncloaked to hack the defense can, but if you cloaked up to avoid turret aggro, you may have done so for too long and despawned the site on accident.  It takes less than 2 minutes of cloaking to despawn a sleeper cache, I learned that lesson with a standard sleeper when I went to the shitter.
---
Honestly, this dude sounds like, and acts like that "evocotiv hera" dude or whatever his name is, the one that got banned by CCP. Jesus the responses and the way he flies off the handle is uncannily similar...
---
this!
---
blimey thats like an ear full of veet 
---
just check the volume moved dude, it's on the market window. You ain't gonna make money with industry as an alpha tho, unless you're doing maybe rigs(?), the lack of bonuses are just too hard on the profits.
---
how is the posting on this sub still getting worse
---
ah, the good old "WHAT DOES THIS DOOMSDAY BUTTON DO FC?"
---
cool
---
ok how did you do the formatting of this post to embed an image in the middle? that's amazing
---
whom'st
---
no you don't have finish all 7 chapters to apply, i represent Associates. 
---
i just dragged the image directly into the post
---
Ya'll should've just joined Goons instead of keeping up this facade of activity. All those frags in null-sec are all fake and just show how dead you guys really are.
---
are you using beta mode and the fancy pants editor on the new site?
---
What? They keep instant backup at distance for the life of the inhib. With proper Sabre bubbles they can keep backup away long enough to secure kills. They're amazing put simply.
---
was more like-   
---
"im firing the dd"   
---
"wait what? don't do that i'm here in my carrier"

...

 "seriously don't fire it"

Still waiting for tabula rasa private server :(
