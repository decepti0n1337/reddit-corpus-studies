Imperium controls the west and north now.
---
---
---
&gt; I don't recall the time frame (I think it was before the winter) but basically TEST was being attacked by all the new eastern entities and PL decided to jump on the bandwagon and deploy their super fleet there too.
---

---
you apparently don recall what happened either. What new eastern entities were hitting test lmao, if anything test was hitting them while helping xix.
---
While true the salvaging component from missions etc is not a high percentage of the value to the task (due to bounties, LP and other rewards) however in these sites the majority of the isk is contained in the salvage alone.

If I stop winning EvE, Im thinking about being an Alpha with a mining Dominix ...
---
Hi, I know that r/evenewbies exists, but I couldn't find all the answers I was searching for in their sticky. So, I will ask them here.
---
1. Is it possible (and feasible with not too much time) to spend 0 real money and get 600m ISP to get 30 days of game time? Or do you need at least 1 month of sub before this?
---
2. I found this game through this B-R5RB thing, and was intrigued by the idea of big alliances, politics, and wars. Does this kind of thing still happen, or is there one big power now? I am also interested in the idea of joining the losing side...
---
3. I heard that the economy of this game was getting worse and worse - I quit WoW because I joined around the time BfA released and reactions were horrible, is a similar thing happening with this game?
---
4. What are the economic elements really like? I am very interested in focusing on the economic and political/management parts, could someone please provide details to me?
---
5. How easy is it to join a big corporation/alliance? I can play 10-12 hours a week - at that rate, if I aim to spend as little real money as possible, how long will it take me to work my way up the ranks and landmarks of Eve and ultimately be part of a large corporation? My end goal, what I want to do, with this game, is to help provide economy for some alliance.
---
Thanks for answering questions! Sorry for the formatting, I'm on PC, and sorry for the spelling/punctuation errors, English is my first language.

Im not saying im a more moral or virtuous person then Creecher because im am expressing disgust over his use of words but I am moral because I wouldn't use that word in the first place not have I ever thought it was ok to say that word nor use the implications that Creecher used.
---
Yeah skill u and friends totally didn't deployed south with their supers.

I use a pioneer DDJ-SX with serato, some use actual vinyl, it's all good and if you need help with setup the recruitment team is on point bruh.  -DJ Kiro AKA Bumpirate_69 AKA Zorah Shade.

The only reason we have queerswarm and other groups is to attract as many people and as many twitch viewers as possible lol you sweet summer child

Hahahahahahahahaha
---
Oh wow, somebody said the dreaded WORD THAT SHALL NOT BE MENTIONED™ in a context that doesn't even remotely involve race in the slightest. And why should I care about this?
---
P.S. lol at that comment complaining about test using the term "Jewing" on their forums. Look, I really don't like test either, but you're just either trolling or you are actually somebody who really shouldn't be playing a game like this in the first place.
---
So, wait, all of these alliances are teamed up even further into coalitions?! To what extent? If two corps go to war based in two separate coalitions, could it spark a multi-region level war?
---
You are not controlling shit. So far your retard members keep jumping caps to cyno beacons and your travel inties get nuked on gate camps cause they literally have no clue. To top that up, 2 of these bs's that are fucking up those inties just casually slowboated through systems you where reinforcing with 600 dudes in local. No people on gate, no eyes in surrounding systems.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You lot are so terrible at this game.
---
Ratting involves doing one of the following:
---
1. Killing NPC pirates for their bounties.
---
2. Security Agent Missions
---
3. High Sec Incursions (Google warp to me)
---
4. Abyssal Sites.
---
Exploration involves using a Probe launcher and probes to scan for data and relic sites or diving in wormholes to find them. You hack the loot boxes found in the site and scoop the contents.
---
they were after xix, who was being harbored by test after hitting them both, the tirade against test only came when they got in the way. Also they lived nearby so a formal deployment is kinda unnecessary
---
I went to the one near amarr, they shot me
---
"a contemptuous term for a black or dark-skinned person."
---
im sorry did the definition change recently or something because it still seems as if the word is used as a derogatory term for a dark skinned individual. Hell the word itself was only considered derogatory because it was a term for a dark skinned individuals. When you use the word as a insult you are latterly calling someone a dark skinned individual and that you somehow see that as insulting.
---
Didn't Brisc's polling say we shouldn't touch CONCORD at all?
---
such as?
---
they all gone mate
---
&gt; Their corp/alliance misses out on ISK over it. They personally miss ISK over it.
---
irrelevant to the fact that you can ignore all player interaction in nullsec if you wish.
---
&gt;It's just people bitching because they can't get their killmail but also aren't willing to dare go somewhere as scary as the big bad wormhole
---
wormholes are more dead than nullsec, no content there
---
also stop huffing your own farts
---
Yeah, I mean a lot of the west is at war with the north right now, and the south is semi at war with the east/southeast.
---
&gt;why we should then give a shit about you and your dead-ass space holes.
---
Nullsec hunters bitching about how local stops their hunting. If they can't hunt with local, then they should go to wormholes where it doesn't exist. I'm sorry if your brain can't handle that concept.
---
&gt;your krabs are better.
---
Well they're certainly a jucier killmail than the neighbour's VNI
---
Yes, because all of the eastern entities deploying their supers south was totally not going to trigger TEST to defend their ally that was just severely hit in the balls.
---
&gt; irrelevant to the fact that you can ignore all player interaction in nullsec if you wish.
---
If they ignore they get killed?
---
&gt;wormholes are more dead than nullsec, no content there
---
Either do your hunting in "dead" space where you get 2b krab ships or stop bitching about how null isn't wormholes
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Whew, the salt must flow
---
Just transfer the structure to them too.
---
What did he do there...?
---
TEST has no skill point requirement. I believe you were looking at Dreddit, who have a 15 million skill point requirement. Other corps have different requirements, Brand Newbros has no skill point requirements at all. We only require that you own a working mic and participate in at least some stratops per month.
---
test was helping xix before they got hit in the balls mate, it was also before they were hit in the balls that with the help of test they evicted tri. You're also assuming test babysitting them was a reaction to supers being moved "south", when that might actually be the reason they were moved there hmmmmm.
---
the stupid dino extinction shit was purely pl.
---
In goons and would vote for a kitten killing leader. Checks out.

I thought you had a strict ballot to follow anyway?
---
Shut up faggot go neck yourself
---
You first.
---
As you stated your mostly an annoyance to most larger entities. Although we would love to brawl you in a proper fight for the fun of it we also know that it will never happen. The moment there is little bit of risk you dock up.
---
War deccing corporations/alliances do it for 1 thing and 1 thing only. Easy kills and easy isk. You are all a bunch of gankers in the most literal form.
---
[removed]
---
I think it's some Goon.
---
Just like how in every thread there must be a panfam member pointing at the kill board and ignoring the strat objective because they couldn't achieve it.
---
&gt;If they ignore they get killed?
---
you don't seem to understand
---
If you don't want PvP, you can dock up.
---
If you know no one is nearby, you can PvE.
---
You always know when someone is nearby.
---
Therefore, you can always avoid PvP
---
Venture has a 5000 m3 ore hold and decent yield for its price, but unfortunately it is about the best you're gonna get an alpha.  Since mining is so hands-off and AFKable, they can't really let F2P players use barges or people could multibox/bot armies of them for free and screw up the economy more.
---
If they're docked up they don't get anything. Stop bitching just because you want the mechanics of one type of space while actually being in another you fucking retard.
---
&gt;If they're docked up they don't get anything.

Okay, and?

&gt; how do they gain a position on the csm with no community interaction?

I lost my google authenticator account. Ccp will disable the 2fa for you but it took about 8 days for me.

What you really want is a Corp to teach you things.
---
Just moving the chat into a cloud provider destroyed local. If you ask them to put animations on it we may all actually die.
---
&gt; Okay, and?
---
They dock up, they end up making less of their precious 10m vni ticks because they got scared.
---
If we're removing null local, why not also add sov to lowsec because I want to cyno jam my systems without losing gate guns, or any of the other potential and immensely retarded "give me this mechanic but don't make me go to the type of space that exists to provide it" suggestions.
---
*What's
---
Dunk for president!
---
You are aids, you know you are aids... worthless brainwashed liberal nazi, fuck off
---
I'm not crying YOU'RE CRYING!
---
right, and while they are at it, remove hi-sec and wormhole space.
---
Yeah no.
---
and mine too!
---
&gt;They dock up, they end up making less of their precious 10m vni ticks because they got scared.
---
sure, and when you leave they continue, but that's irrelevant, it's not about stopping them, it's about hunting being viable outside of killing afks and broken bots.
---

I already explained to you why- this is about adding non-consensual pvp into nullsec.

Oh I'm sorry are you not capable of any nullsec pvp unless it's against a krab? Sorry I forgot how elite you are, silly me thinking people could fight non-krabs
---
I'll make him do this in Toronto.
---
Untill CCP figures out a way to fix the botting situation and plex comes down to a reasonable price, where i dont have to spend all of my time on eve just trying to keep my account active, I'm going to downvote every fucking day. 
---
Getting omega is 2.13 billion?????? That shit is crazy. When I fucking started, to plex cost me 500mil and i could deal with that and still enjoy the game. Now I just fucking grind all the time. No pvp. Just grind grind grind.

I want to play a game, not do a job.

I think you may have made your bed sir. Make a neutral alt or leave your WHs for a bit?

Shhhh just keep killing them nasty VNI botters.
---
That was the most wholesome EVE video ever.
---
NC left a lot of pride there, maybe you can collect that?
---
im glad you're having fun, really am, hell i'm in like 1/3 of these brs by the looks of it but lets be real here: aren't pretty much all of these small sov holders leaving or left already?
---
Aryth and The Mittani are not the same person.
---
My issue with the  botting situation is that I have to spend all of my time on eve just trying to keep my account active. The bots getting isk as easily and dumping isk into the game is pushing inflation to the next level.
---
Getting omega is 2.13 billion?????? That shit is crazy. When I fucking started, to plex cost me 500mil and i could deal with that and still enjoy the game. Now I just fucking grind all the time. No pvp. Just grind grind grind.
---
Tri and PL I believe left but due to the goon campaign. I'm sure Cone/Fission will be staying as well as banderlogs. 
---
I know Theran used to be somewhat of a thing for snuff until their timers got switched to Ranger Regiment prime.
---
really gets the noggin jogging
---
Nope. Asymmetric warfare is all about player on player. Blobs rorquals. Afk cloak in krabbing systems. Roam to make it as unsafe to krab as possible.
---
Still got mine on my desk homie, also interesting to see someone still using the glory flair.
---
Because of that big black dildo you put in your mouth.
---
Gotta love the vocal minority screaming from these pages. +1 to having a pulse to cast a vote, and 1 per pulse.
---
Join horde. They won't leave you hanging. And we have cookies.
---
Also eve mail my character by this same name. I can help a bro out.
---
banderlogs doesn't fight against snuff first of all. there is nothing cone and gone fission can do against snuff + init, and that's not a statement on their skill or lack thereof but one of numbers so if they want to take them out they will pretty easily. pl is not a pb alliance and was just coming as a batphone against init afaik, tri was realistically speaking the biggest individual force in the area. I mean i guess you could include fxr and violente fortuna in those small alliances but they're really just init renters with a degree of separation. and theran isn't in pb either
---
Fake news
---
caring about an anchoring fort when the other side fex 5x its price is a nice meme
---
The major power players (and their coalitions) are:
---
* **Goonswarm (Imperium) -** The founder and primary alliance in the Imperium, which is currently the biggest and strongest coalition the game has ever seen. They live in Delve in the southwest and control regions spanning all the way up to the north along the western side of the universe.
---
* **The Initiative (Imperium) -** A member alliance of the Imperium coalition, Initiative recently made headlines by evicting the famous wormhole alliance Hard Knocks. They live in the west.
---
* **Bastion (Imperium) -** Another member alliance of the Imperium, Bastion were recently in the news due to the scandal over Brisc Rubal's (improper) removal from and reinstatement to the CSM. They also shoot things when they're not politicking. 
---
* **Northern Coalition (PanFam) -** An alliance of veteran pilots, NC. have a long partnership with Pandemic Legion (below). They control territories in the north, including large rental territories.
---
* **Pandemic Legion (PanFam) -** Formally the boogeyman of Eve, PL were historically an alliance of nomadic supercapital pilots who preyed on weaker alliances. They are the "Pan" in PanFam, and have a years-long rivalry with Goonswarm/Imperium. They live in the north with NC. and Pandemic Horde (below).
---
* **Pandemic Horde (PanFam) -** Once the meat shield for PanFam, now a strong alliance in it's own right. Horde is notable as probably the most successful new player friendly alliance. They live in the northeast.
---
* **Test Alliance Please Ignore (Legacy) -** Co-founder and primary alliance in Legacy Coalition in the south. Allied with the Imperium to form the Imperial Legacy mega-coalition. We live in the south.
---
* **Brave Newbies (Legacy) -** One of the core alliances in Legacy Coalition with TEST, and one of the early new player friendly alliances. They reside in the south.
---
* **Legion of xXDEATHXx (F.I.R.E.) -** Formerly the primary alliance in the east, XIX were evicted by Skill Urself and some other alliances in the build up to the great war last year. Now they are friendly with Legacy and are building the F.I.R.E. coalition in the southeast.
---
* **The Army of Mango Alliance -** Just came to our server after conquering the Chinese server, the Mangos have settled in the southeast and are friendly with Legacy.
---
* **Fraternity (Winter Coalition) -** The primary force behind Winter Coalition, Fraternity are an older Chinese-based (but not exclusively) alliance who recently grew exponentially. Their war with Legacy escalated into the great war last year. They live in the east.
---
* **Skill Urself (Holy Rental Empire) -** Unlike most alliances in this list, Skill Urself is relatively new and formed last year prior to the great war. They run vast rental empires in the east. 
---
* **DARKNESS (Dead Coalition) -** The primary alliance in Dead Coalition, formerly allies of PanFam until surrendering to Imperium in the big war last summer, which resulted in fighting against Horde. They live in the northwest.
---
* **Ranger Regiment (Dead Coalition) -** Formerly a member in Winter Coalition, they joined Guardians of the Galaxy (now Dead Coalition) prior to the great war last summer. They live next to DARKNESS in the northwest.
---
* **Snuffed Out -** The dominant alliance in low security space, Snuffed Out are notorious for hotdropping on unsuspecting supercapital ships. Formerly a member alliance in the Imperium.
---
* **Hard Knocks (wormhole) -** Once the big badasses of wormhole space, HK were recently humbled when The Initiative launched a surprise attack on their well defended home in Rage (wormhole space) and evicted them. They also have rental territory in the northeast.
---
* **Lazerhawks (wormhole) -** Another large wormhole alliance, Lazerhawks have also been playing in nullsec lately. I'm less familiar with these guys.
---
Definitely not a complete list, just the names you are likely to see if you scroll through the posts from the last couple of months in this subreddit.
---
imgay
---
Semantics aside all I am saying is fedup had options other than bailing to test.
---
You're right, we never claimed to be better than bad at EVE.
---
My corp has had people that are 18 years old, even younger, we even had this one dude who was 19 and a really solid FC. A good community wont care about your age if you act in a mature manner. (Out of Focus if you're wondering)
---
Don't you understand how important it is to smartbomb travelceptors tho?
---
Did you mute the part where he said that it's not what the CSM is supposed to do? CCP wants the CSM to bounce their ideas off them, and almost all suggestions from the CSM that ended up implemented were quick, easy, small quality of life changes. He still suggested a few anyway for that very question.
---
Wait. I've been trolled. You win. Well played.
---
Honorable mention:
---
* **Delve Pest Control Inc -** The whalers and cloaky campers harassing Imperium krabs in the south. One of their CEOs made that cool whaling video last week.
---
They're the economist for goons. 
---
They don't play the actual game that much but do put in the hours on metagame stuff. 
---
Guaranteed a high spot in the Goons how-to-vote, so guaranteed to be on CSM each year.
---
So when I call you a little bitch I am calling you a small female dog?
---
they surely did, but would it be all that much different really? in cloud ring they already blued goons as fast as they could and housed their keep when they decided to go north, at least going to legacy they would be an actual member i guess and not just someone grasping at every survival straw they could. This decline in relevant activity was not the fault of legacy, was the fault of the leaders trying to appease legacy and doing close to nothing on their own to the detriment of their members. Its an easy trap to fall into, and oh boy they went head first.
---
Yep.  Given that initial video that the Triglavians spammed to all the stations, I can't help but get the sense that this isn't a true invasion as much as it's a trial by fire for potential allies.
---
The trains run on mountain dew, the tracks weave between gentle rolling hills of cheeto dust and empty pizza roll boxes.

This has inspired me but alas I lack to motivation toclead such a loyalist faction hahah The RP behind would be really fun though!!

https://youtu.be/KZQ4ejFq7BY
---
This is very good video on one of the big wars in EVE, most of the info on the coalitions is outdated, but you could get a grasp on the bigger alliances
---
Those of you commenting about the seemingly "mistaken" strings, this is how Sisi works. They are actively trying to hide information from us, and so using bad strings and other tricks. They have always done this kind of thing (mostly just stand in text), but since Invasion, they have seriously ramped up the OPSEC.
---
For the State!
---
Knowing CCP's "macrotransactions"  they'd be like 250 PLEX each...and be single-use.  Also, have to buy one specific to the ship you're flying or they don't work.
---
You mock him for believing infowars, but you believed whoever told you they were ID'd as reporters. I haven't looked into it so I don't have an opinion one way or another, but the idea that reporters somehow had military gear at the ready to somehow allow them closer access is pretty silly. Dismissing things as "conspiracy theories" does not invalidate them, nor is it an argument.
---
1-no. It actually costs around 2 billion ISK to get a month of omega, which is around 50mil/day. It’s doable with some luck, but it’s no fun.
---
2- there is a big power difference between alliances at the moment, and will likely stay that way unless ccp changes the game or someone betrays the big guys. You can absolutely join the “little” guys, they are still big groups, with 1,000+ players, but they are currently using Guerilla tactics to undermine their enemies’ industry.
---
3- I don’t know a lot about WOW, but eve is experiencing some inflation due to really good industry and game mechanics. It’s not that bad though.
---
4-idk, I just loot crap and sell it to buy stuff to kill things with.
---
5-stupid easy. Google the alliance name, (pandemic horde, brave newbies, dreddit) and you can find their site.
---
Neat. Think I need to try this next time I get on.
---
yes  you are calling me female dog , why its insulting is because you think being a female dog is insulting , for whatever reason .
---
I was with dunk until the pineapple pizza. I will not vote for such heresy!
---
Actually a relic analyzer is fine too
---
ESO has a new dragon DLC out, check it out
---
Pineapple on pizza = no vote.
---
I've got no skin in this but lets not kid ourselves that no one said the new sov system or these new structures would be horrid.  
---
It's just that CCP will full steam ahead on practically anything with zero regard for feedback or even player suggestions from Sisi.  
---
Goons are just one of the many groups that keep on top of exploiting whatever CCP comes up with, which is kinda the EVE thing to do.
---
I'd like to argue that im in one of the most important alliances. 
---
We're not the most powerful, or have the most impact though we do our fair share in large coalition battles with legacy/test.
---
However we're a brilliant newbie friendly alliance that helps with learning the ropes and player retention, we get many older players return to US to relearn the game. we don't enforce strict null rules even though we live there which allows players to get a feel for the game and null way of life before picking a larger nullsec Corp or deciding it isn't for them and going to FW/lowsec/highsec. 
---
But thats just a part of what's important. I'd say the main reason we're the most important is because we have an attitude completely the opposite of the rest of eve. Whilst most places dock up when ships roam through we will undock a plethora of Atrons and gladly throw them at your face until they explode. And then likely reship and come back in more. We're all about the fun. Not about the ISK. 
---
And that's why every alliance/small gang comes to us when they roam. they know unless we're out on a fleet that they'll get content.
---
Eve is dying! (lol!) But in catch the game stays alive.

No, Praxis is the subcapital combat ship with largest cargo

Null Security space is just full of people that get farmed by the chad wormholers. Low Security space is cool. Null Security space is kind of irrelevant.

Still a better love story than Twilight.

gosh you think i'm in panfam amazing
---
25? That's awful young to be playing Eve. I figured most of us were at least 40.
---
Err, brain fart. My bad, my bad, uno momento.
---
Battleship cargo is incredibly limited if you were to base it on size and I imagine it was based on limiting cap boosters.
---

A one day old moron with a credit card can have 14 million skillpoints. That number means nothing honestly. Skillpoints/XP does not mean actual experience. Give me a 3 mill SP pilot that knows what they are doing over a 30 mill pilot that doesn't know how to anchor.
---
Join Brave. We've got a member who's 14 who logs in from time to time. And we are all big children.
---
The only reason I can possibly imagine is that there was some licensing crap in their contract with Sony. Beyond that, I got nothing. Despite its many faults, dust was actually a really good game and a fresh take on a genre that has been beaten to death, back to life and then to death again.
---
They could just tighten up the graphics a bit, clear up some bugs and dump it on PC and I would be thrilled.
---
So your answer is to do PvE? How about no?

the bad guy, duh

You got my vote at "unselect all" in the redemption queue. I JUST WANT TO REDEEM THE FRICKEN 25,000 SKILLPOINTS REALLY QUICKLY!
---
I recently came back to Eve after quite a hiatus, and noticed I'm an in Ibis with 7k isk at the tutorial. Is there anyway to skip the tutorial? And also, do I get my ships and isk back after? I have all of my skills still but nothing else
---
So I'm in alpha mode for the moment and don't want to break out any of my ships so I have been one of the many ninja looters out there, first day I made 2.4bil enough to Plex my account, lost like 15 some odd Corvettes and didn't invest a dime. Honestly a lot of fun
---
I'd say golem or kronos or any capital, but since you're going for alpha only then i guess praxis has the largest cargo size
---
You know who has the burden of proof here right?
---
Started playing eve online
---
I had a person come in station, undock, get in his pod and dropped a shuttle for him, he gave me 3000isk it went off without a hitch
---
I thought this was a buff battleship cargo post, disappointed. Give us moooore

Delay local in 2019?
---
Whoa, I’m sure r/eve never has thought of this before! Great input!
---
You can remote rep Triglavian ships.
---
Shit, I lost track a long time ago. How about just the dumbest thing I did today?
---
/u/stuartx13 Listen to this guy, he was one of the primary corp CEOs for MC :P
---
omg he came back again today!
---
While I agree with you in spirit, that's not entirely true. One of the coolest (now dead) asymmetric warfare mechanics I've seen in the game was the moon goo siphons, which are somewhat similar to what I think the OP is getting at.

---
Thank you for taking the time to post this kind sir, I always like learning a little more about alliances, I knew most but wasn’t sure exactly about the WH and low sec ones
---
Edit:Typo
---
&gt;but wasn’t sure exactly about the WH and low sec ones
---
Ehh, to be fair, that makes two of us...
---
But I put down what I could.
---
Second dumbest thing was starting to play Eve Online.
---
Most dumb thing was continuing to play Eve Online
---
So many.
---
 I've lost a jump freighter in highsec on a gate.
---
I've bombed myself.
---
I've gated an aeon super 36 jumps because I couldn't be f'd to cyno.
---
I gated a dreadnought 12 jumps during a stratop fleet to kill a POS got there and forgot to bring stront. 
---
I've warped to zero on everything.
---
I fly a Kronos in standing fleet because if I don't who will?
---
I've awoxed half my alliance
---
I spam local even when it's full of blues
---
I've undocked a Titan from a sotiyo and had no fuel and nowhere to dock it.
---
I've bought missile ammo on a stratop for an artillery fit ship.
---
I've left station and gone on a roam with guns offline.
---
I got my ISK doubled in jita.
---
Me and my mining Hyperion agree fullheartedly :P
---
Whilst I do agree with your statements, my whole point of the post above is the simple fact that YOU didn't plead your case here and someone else did for you and only after the fact did you come along. 
---
   
---
  
---
Now this may be because you where going to post here yourself regarding the whole situation and the OP got infront of you, I get that, it still LOOKS (and optics are VERY important in an election campaign) like you just went 'meh' and didn't follow through and address the people that would back you and current CSM members that mayof been able to get it looked into or CCP to look into it due to public support (not saying CSM members would or would not, just hypothetical example) and allow you on the ballot.
---
    
---
Does it suck for you and your situation? Fuck yes, of course it does. However as your an unknown quantity outside of WH circles. Reacting in anything other than polite dialog with CCP usually results in being shut down and being hostile just gets them to shut down the conversation because you wouldn't be worht the hassle, so it's good you went that route, however it seems this is hardly a precedent. It sucks, it's shit, but sadly it is what it is.
---
my point still stands though: having someone else fight your fight doesn't look good in the public eye and I don't care about the downvotes this opinion may have. As a potential candidate it did make you look weak, even if it was through no fault of your own and the OP getting ahead of you.
---
Hopefully next year you get on, hell I hope you somehow manage to get on this year because the reasons you got missed out are bullshit (and may even get a vote from me for what it's worth, WH need someone).
---

---
Big difference between delaying local by x amount of seconds and delaying local until you actually get out of black screen and can interact with the client.
---
Delay or just have it show you when you're actually there?
---
Nobody had military gear at the ready, that's some made up bullshit. The report came directly from statements from the police, unless of course you're going to be one of those people that swears that everything is some huge cover-up and nobody can be believed, even though you can provide no proof yourself to back up those claims.

I would say more Bill Ackerman, Mitch is pretty dumb when it comes to the economy
---
If this is true, that's quite unfortunate. I can guarantee that that has not been FEDUP culture since joining Legacy, though. There's been no rebranding of Legacy stratops, we get the same pings as everyone else. Outside of actual CTA's, both Coalition and  Alliance, we're not dicks about attendance. Of course, members are encouraged to take part in all content, and we try to be as active as possible as content generators for all of our Immensea bros. I haven't seen anything "toxic" about us, before or since our move south, in over 2 years. It's a great group of people.
---
Put an Aeon into build shortly after Phoebe was announced...in Outer Passage
---
Why not try it out? Join a FW Corp even?
---
Plz write a book
---
There's alot to experience in EvE. You can definitely do FW.
---
If you ever feel like getting into an alliance and learning and doing other things then come have some fun with us in Brave, we're new player friendly and have alot of classes on different gameplay aspects, we have welcome packages great krabbing/exploring space. We're part of one of the larger nullsec coalitions, there's no fleet requirements and we have an emphasis on fun you can even get into wormholing. 
---
Carrying two old value Plex in a frigate headed to Jita. Didn’t last long.....

nyx on my subcap main
---
It's a good idea for the wrong reasons... anything that gets you to pvp (or out of highsec) is a plus but you should also probably try to learn the mechanics a bit before going off the deep end with one of the most neglected unappreciated aspects of the game.

Hawaiian pizza is pretty good.

Prove me wrong.

I'm hoping to get a Chemosh for my 49th birthday in a couple months :p

To continue the dread story: one of my Corp mates went and got me stront in an Indy ship. Came back and gave it to me

I sieged up. And then got dropped on by a wyvern.

The Earth is flat and God is real

Yep, I have the recording of it...its sad that Legacy alliances talk shit about their own but quickly to pick up that batphone when shit turns into a pickle
---
Fit?
---
So i have been working on mining expeditions(recourse wars) and with the new agency i can't locate them any more, does anyone know where to find them now. I would love to finish grinding my LP or Republic Fleet Ordinance. 
---
THanks
---
It's about as PvE as shooting structures.
---
thank god legacy has you here to defend their failures. it's so hard to anchor a fortizar, I just don't know how we'll manage to do it again. I'm also so pleased you spoke up every time Seddow anchored a content raitaru in O3 and got some kills while it died. You were right to criticize him for failing to secure the objective! I mean; I assume you criticized him. I haven't gone back and check. But it's not like you'd be a massive hypocrite or anything.
---
maybe we should just pull a Vily and declare tomorrow day 1 of the war, start fresh, pretend nothing happened before tomorrow.
---
I've been having some trouble recently where if I switch my Overview to Enemies Only then my fleet mates disappear from  my HUD (not just overview). This can make it hard to see if I am still with my squad. Is there any fix or workaround?
---
I have tried target locking a team mate to give an always on distance meter, but this has a number of disadvantages.
---
warped to fc's blops ship at zero in a bomber fleet and forgot to cloak. 
---
thankfully i was the second guy to do that. the third guy got commisared
---
So where do I begin... the Rorqs? Rag? or Vendetta?
---
No, edit it back so you don't ruin Elo's response to you.

Dunk is correct on the role of the CSM. They should not be 'Junior game Designers'.

I play to run a base in space. We build, mine, research, reactions, we recently setup Pi in null. Eve is one of the few games I've played that gets better and better over time. I've hit a point now where I can make 1-2b isk a week and the game is really different to me now. Idle games that don't have a point and I'll never keep up with amusement park MMOs that reset every expansion.
---
Believe it or not, the meaning and intent of a word can actually completely change depending on the context of which it is used.
---
I understand you might not understand this as it seems that you don't really have a basic grasp on language as a concept in general, but it's true! Language isn't something that is completely stagnant, it actually changes over time and is a very dynamic thing, believe it or not.
---
Why shoot their PvP ships when he knows they had a massive super cap umbrella. Hit the crabs where it hurts. In their super and rorq balls.
---
oh man the truth really hurts the narrative :-(
---
&lt;3 brave
---
the only people still in 1dq are non combat alts and HD alphas. the HD peeps wont undock unless youre trying to ref a gate because no one cares. 
---
come to kqk ;)
---
Lets see...
---
Target painted a wreck my friend created in high sec (we weren't ganged). Concord is indeed the police; they hate laser pointers. 
---
Trained interdictors. Now I've been a guilty party on my own podmails.
---
I found this kind of dumb too. For example, there's a huge delay from when you enter a system by logging in compared to gating in.
---
I would have designed it such that you click on the character screen to log in, then everything loads up and caches, then you have a button, "enter system." Then when you press that you enter and it's nice and fast to enter, just as though you had just gated in.
---
We will likely fleet up again tomorrow, as interest is booming. all are welcome. add me as contact ingame and you'll get an equal share just by showing up
---
Shit I made the mistake of adding up my "sub" fees since I started playing. I plexed near most of it but 10 years and 5 accounts add up at $15 a month each
---
Wormhole Life Problems. Though us wormhole folk do make regular day trips into K-Space.
---
i only have aura, gate/ warp sounds, and damage warnings turned on. its nice to be able to get an audible indicator that someone took a gate when im camping it. that way i can tab out when waiting instead of staring at a gate and waiting for a flash.
---
Lost a stratios with 8b in cargo and 4b in BPCs to a gate camp I really shouldn't have lost a cloaky ship to. I talked to the guys who killed me afterwards though and found out it was a birthday roam for one of their corp mates. I like to think I was just giving them a birthday present.
---
If I post it here, I can't be ban for it right?
---
Without reading other comments:
---
I wanted a solid MMO, and something I could use as an excuse to help with RL stuff.
---
By that I mean, I'm a husband and father. I work FT, and I'm a FT student. My ability to socialize is minimal. I also need a foreign language component for college... soo...
---
I thought, what game allows me to socialize, have fun, AND immerse myself in another language?
---
EvE.
---
I havent decided on another language, but I've made it a point to socialize more in-game, have met some pretty cool people in EUTZ that were open to working with me while I stumble through another language, and I made it a point to take it slow this time around, and focus on fun (my 3rd time trying EvE and the longest yet at 7 months).
---
It hasnt all been great... had my alliances single low sec station and moon get camped by pirates for a week which sucked. Currently experiencing 99% of the alliance MIA, with 0 active moon drills of 5 possible, and no response from the alliance executor on allowing my Corp to take some over to keep them running.
---
For now, I post calendar events, try to slowly recruit and build my corp while I prepare for the fall when I'll have classes again and will be mostly providing mining boosts with the occasional op while I decide on that 2nd language...
---
Until then... I'll make my iskies, invest in more BPOs when people tell me not to, and try to build up that comradery.
---
It's a fun game, but it's hard to have fun solo. Very limiting.
---
- also just because you are Gallente, doesn't mean you need to join Gallente FW
---
wave: HON HON HON HON HON HON HON HON HON HON
---
Shoot me a message I will meet you in toma just warp to the thing called novice in your overview. It’s like a training ground thing I will help you out
---
Then why not get a replacement? Just because someone left for another job and publicly didn’t shit talk the company doesn’t mean he wasn’t encouraged to leave or left because there were issues with the job.
---
We know that CCP didn’t treat him very well, it was in Jesterterks AMA or something
---
Regardless the effect on the game was the same because they never got a replacement, so it doesn’t really matter
---
And the killboard maintainers could, if they so chose, decide to exclude ships never piloted by the "owner" to eliminate this sort of noise.
---
What you should do is join brave newbies and get on comms and our slack, come down to impass, take advantage of our dojo classes and free ship handouts. Get to know some people and have some fun while you learn about industry and krabbing (and potentially all other aspects of the game from wormholing to faction warfare) , and yes we accept alpha characters!
---
you won't regret it.

"Requires Power Grid Management V"
---
&gt;waa i hate eve ccp doesnt care how i feel about the game
---
ccp: adds a quality check button
---
&gt;waa i hate that ccp is taking an interest in my opinion of the game
---
&gt; CCP has to figure out a way to handle this.
---
If CCP maintained the killboard service, sure. But killboards were made and are maintained by third parties. It's up to those third parties to detect noise and manipulation such as this.
---
They need to just got rid of this crap. You can’t put out pve content that cannot scale with group size. There should have just been special anomalies that scaled from solo to large fleet this is a dumb blockage of highsec and has cause many that I know to not play
---
Can it never come back? This content is really stupid and has caused me and my group to feel like we can’t play
---
Wow not even 48 hrs huh
---
if you would undock more you might actually enjoy the game. 
---
there is more to eve that sitting in a station.
---
My corp actually just got a page of red from a fleet of exhumers a corpmate had in a previous corp’s WH citadel, I don’t know why they had so many though, I try to keep just the ships I’m using in our hole.
---
So you’re saying they’re fat fucks who eat donuts?
---
It's one of three. And we don't know what's going to happen from here with more spawning. Likewise, CCP's probably tweaking numbers on the back-end.
---
No idea. My guess is a new Trigcursion will spawn somewhere, but...
---
As to the 'me and my group to feel like we can't play,' how do you mean?
---
You win
---
Idk go join a wh corp
---
Those are fun if you have enough isk to survive without krabbing, or want to krab infrequently.
---
We have been cut off from amarr and we use amarr as a trade hub. Zoned into one of these stupid systems and was insta locked and blown to pieces. I play with a bunch on new players they are scared to death to go through this space and it’s not cool to have wear sitting on the damn gate.
---
Rumor is he works for Fortune 500 company and is the goon head isk maker
---
Love, hate, somewhere in between he mad delve what it is....and i no goon 😋
---
With you, the fun never ends m8.
---
the blue lights are dock radius. OP is talking about the red lights that are farther away from the station. There is a ring of them and 2 or 3 lines of lights.
---
I have ships all over the place. It lets me track my history of where I was when. Though my assets window is a nightmare.
---
And unless you can fly a bunch of 500m ships you can’t do shit in these it should have been good solo content. Not Uber no life huge fleet trash. The fleet stuff should spawn deep in null
---
I black screen everytime i jump a system fpr the past week lol
---
This cannot be accurate. TRI is dead.
---
It's called test server mate
---
&gt; How can you accurately "Represent the player base" if you yourself cannot see that race itself is a meaningless factor in determining ones worth ?
---
how do you even see people's race over the internet.
---
that's pretty much why it doesn't matter.
---
&gt;If think an arbitrary trait is indicative of anything more then melanin content how can we trust you to be a good judge of what the game needs ?
---
because the two are completely unrelated.
---
No. Just no. He is worse than materall. Almost as  bad as Elon and Dirk.
---
&gt; I thought you had a strict ballot to follow anyway?
---
it works exactly like this. leadership says "vote for these people", you vote how the fuck you want, and as long as you don't go around saying "i didn't do as i was told" nobody gives a fuck.
---
So was there an arkship fight like Incursion HQ?
---
Did it pay off with LP as rumoured?
---
Flew a rattlesnake to a camped gate and got popped. Went full retard and did the same fucking thing 10 minutes later with my half asleep ass thinking “they can’t still be there.” Yeah I was wrong.
---
probably took a bait gnosis in one of the first agency events. cost me a 1bn isk tengu and caldari offensive systems V if memory serves.
---
rather minor relative to other fuckups.
---
It's EvE. You're supposed to be scared to death.
---
&gt; Wow not even 48 hrs huh
---
it's opening weekend at the box office.
---
once the "ooh shiny and new" factor wears off, they will last a lot longer.
---
&gt; I play with a bunch on new players they are scared to death to go through this space and it’s not cool to have e war sitting on the damn gate.
---
you can literally see what systems are affected by the incursion on the auto pilot. not difficult to avoid them.
---
dunk videos are always the highest iqs, and i love it. This is a good man
---
What's the doctrine for these things?
---
To be fair, some of these are pretty generic stuff that most of us have done
---
**Current Song:** "Backstreet Boys - I want it that way"
---
I will try another time
---
Yep
---
Not if they are in the main pipe
---
It's supposed to be disruptive.
---
It should have disrupted null
---
From what I understood they're just starting with highsec. It will move to null in time.
---
IIRC the sansha incursions were introduced the same way.
---
do you need battle ships or can you run it in cruisers or small ships?
---
I think folk beat it off before that could even happen, to be honest.
---
Are you fucked in the head?
---
HAha ha...... oh i think your telling the truth.
---
That was... anticlimactic
---
♥️♥️♥️
---
i mean, avoid them as in "don't go there and get blown up through ignorance" rather than "go around them".
---
Took 26 null gates in a krab mach without a scout. Lived, somehow.
---
&gt; Just camp them?
---
camping them doesn't kill them though?
---
&gt;Oh I'm sorry are you not capable of any nullsec pvp unless it's against a krab? Sorry I forgot how elite you are, silly me thinking people could fight non-krabs
---
like i said, stop huffing your farts
---
if you think good gameplay is being able to avoid all pvp interaction if you want, that's not how eve online is supposed to work
---
Irrelevant how? Explain plz
---
Whole lot of unneeded writing. No cynos, no supers. Lowsex fixed.
---
It's not over yet. ;)
---
kitchen sink and blob the fuck out of them - from what i've seen there aren't any 'sites' or 'payouts' it's loot/salvage and you just probe down ships and warp to them.
---
When are elections?
---
If you work for Walmart you work for number 1 on the fortune 500 list...
---
I mean, what problem are you trying to fix, mittani wants more blowjobs?
---
For wormhole pve combat as a noob, do I need a battlecruiser or cruiser? What class wormhole will that work up until? Are there any sites where I can learn more?  
---
I've gotten used to relic and data sites but want to get into wormhole PVE as well and am looking where I can find more.
---
ran around in a wh chain looking for sites, didn't find any, got home remembered I had filled my hold so I wouldn't have been able to scoop loot anyway. my hold had gas, probes, and a high-grade ascendancy omega bpc worth about 5b...
---
you got my vote,btw you just like to shot,dont you.
---
But that is my point you can’t avoid it
---
Good luck Dunk!
---
So I can’t tell if I’m just doing something different than normal or not, but I took my VNI out ratting and the rats seemed way more aggressed onto my drones than normal. Like I’m used to maybe one being attacked on the first wave, but the rats just kept taking them out. Ended up losing two praetors and almost a couple more. Did Invasion change normal anomaly rat mechanics or am I just doing something wrong?
---
Love the article, left Eve a while ago and have always been looking for a reason to come back. Any good WH groups out there looking for some returning players?
---
i used sharex, its in the files somewhere if you download it  [https://getsharex.com/](https://getsharex.com/)
---
Nice write up. Really agree with the problem of FW missions being way to profitable compared to plexing. With CCP actually indicating they might finnaly pit work into FW, it would be good to have some CSM members representing it.
---
One thing that I hardly ever see mentioned but IMO is the biggest problem in FW is how the plex mechanics work.
---
Why fight over a plex when it is faster to just fly to the next system and run an uncontested plex. Why defend your plex when whoever is chasing you won’t bother stealing it.
---
If plex mechanics were changed so instead of having to undo others progress you would instead steal it, it would almost completely eliminate farmers and actually encourage pvp in a pvp area.

Depends. High end cruisers, like the Tengu can run up to C3s quite comfortably, while a well tanked Drake can do the same. There’s a lot of variation in ship performance, as well as WH site difficulty, depending on class. Check out Karr’s Modified Rykki’s guide for up to date combat site info.
---
What is this, I don't even.
---
Heads up, resource wars LP is absolutely worthless, since the only things you can buy from the LP store are ship packages where you also have to pay a considerable IsK fee. Notably, the contents of the Tempest pack will cost 30K LP and 250 mil IsK, while the actual contents are worth roughly 160m.
---
Loot is shit. It's all about the salvage.

I don't even play EVE and did unspeakable things to burn the bridge so I may never return

 But goddamn does this man have my vote anyway

Learn the game first , But good advise is a training Corp like  EVE University to get your feet wet and point you in a direction .
---
then maybe like... work together?

its a few npcs not an offline stargate.

Not sure I agree with that. I haven't ton a TON of salvagin though

You don’t stand a chance in tech one ships here without some crazy numbers just check the kill board
---
Did you know that radio from Russian community is active again? [https://evegateradio.ru/](https://evegateradio.ru/) Dunno what you can do with that information but here it is
---
Soooooooo you're virtue signaling then. Gotcha.
---
Form an alliance on only RP reasons.
---
you want to avoid it, just kill the npcs that scram which are very easily identifiable  from the prefix on their name, then warp off.
---
That one is easy - pulled a maxine and killed my unique in a ragequit
---
I also didn't take a trade for moracha when I had the chance but hindsight 20/20, 2018 was not a good year for me
---
So, what show up in your overview and what shows up as brackets in space are two different settings. By default, brackets will mirror your overview, but you can change what brackets show in the overview settings. The [EVE-Uni wiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Overview) goes into this in greater detail.
---
What is the average isk per hour and how many do you need to help you make it?
---
From my understanding as someone not directly involved. Galmil won and got board, so they left. After that Calmil had mostly free reign to regain control as most of the major opposition left with only the more die hard Camil players still around to fight back.
---
Reminder that Vegas is a thing that is happening
---
mental masturbation
---
I think you'll find there is more to low-sec than what roaming nano-gangs want. You already have gated plexes that caps can't get into and gate guns to shoot whatever is tackling you on a gate.
---
People who constantly complain about caps in LS are in the minority. All you're asking for is a two dimensional warzone where the risk averse can gate their battleships around without fear of a fight they can't win.
---
Log neutral alts in every system. No bots can undock and we win \\o/
---
After a while they have to change the bots so they don't to local changes that easily and you can get your kills!
---
Upvoted for Dunk Dinkle, downvoted for pineapple on pizza
---
I noticed in your post that TPUX was not in your list of corps that is willing to be friends.  Was something missed?
---
It was basically just a lack of USTZ content in FW space. The alliance leadership opted to move to CR as a result. We lived out there and then Pure Blind after that before eventually getting evicted. I’m not sure how the whole TAPI thing came about as far as politics go, but there’s plenty of stuff to shoot next door in Detorid and Insmother so I’m not complaining.
---
I’m speaking first hand knowledge of requiem and anecdotally about the rest of Legacy based on what I hear and see in the channels.   Some of what’s posted there about discipline being unfairly applied and CTA spam made me think fedup must fall in some of the sake traps.  Very very familiar.
---
&gt; some kind of module with reduced yield but automatic mining in a lowsec exclusive module similar to how the Thukker array worked with POSes and now citadels.
---
Standup mining fighters that mine moon ore, depositing it as a variant with 40% reduced yields. Athanors can launch one, Tataras two. Only launchable in lowsec and NPC null. Slow travel speed, no mwd. Gives entities a chance to contest the moon in ways besides just shooting the mining citadel since they can shoot and kill the fighters.
---
Even if not specifically this solution, I completely agree that the moon change was a disaster for smaller-scale conflict areas that relied more heavily on it. It's no surprise you can mine with a hundred barges - now rorquals - in sov, but good luck doing that in lowsec or NPC null, especially if your alliance is 5 people.
---
Anyway, you have my vote.
---
JFs and capital movement though.

Yep, "enemy of my enemy is my friend" is also a big thing. PamFam a war a few months ago with Legacy for High Sec trading. Due to Legacy also having a war with Winter Coalition PamFam ended up in Winter Coalition space helping to defend.

How often do you play Below The Asteroids? I could listen to it all day.
---
Exactly.
---
Well, it starts with drinking waaaaaaay too much and ends with an untanked hauler with 27 bil of BPOs on autopilot. The ganker was so heartbroken when less than 5 mil dropped. I think I was so blasted drunk I felt bad for him and gave him a billion ISK. It’s all kind of hazy. End of a long, bad relationship and all that. But I remember looking it up at one point for one of these threads on the EvE forums, and it was something like that. I was in a very fuck it mood.
---
&gt;CCP has to figure out a way to handle this.
---
Nope.  
---
CCP should sandbox the shit out of this one.
---
You could use s battleship with 8x mining lasers and drop the ore into a cargo container... Then collect it periodically in the miasmos 😁
---
I oinda don't want him to go, so he doesn't get rolled over by CCP like the last guy : (
---
ok - you get my vote now
---
None of them on the gates scram, at least not yet, as the invasions ramp up, maybe they will.

All you have to do is travelfit and warp asap

Did he post a fit?
---
Tried gating a doctrine Mach 8 jumps back to staging without a scout - lost it to an inty gang.
---
Back before I could fly ceptors I lost an instawarp slasher full of researched BPO's to a bubble camp.

It's all lessons learned.

What's the purpose of fitting 3 HMLs and 2 RLMLs? Is it some twisty backwards meta logic?

No, but some snooping turns up this killmail. [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76932041/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76932041/)
---
Full of risk adverse krabs that won't take a fight they can't outnumber 500-1, boring/dumb sov mechanics, asset safety, citadel spam... literally everything that is wrong with the game besides highsec incursions.

Some would go as far and call it a shitfit

Most people would agree

It's basically for application purposes to small game riff raff lol. Even with a web, things like assault frigs can be a bit menacing to punch through the reps these days. I fly a 100mn tengu similar fit, also did a video and I was able to engage ecm drones while maintaining dps on the host ship... or ward off other small targets while keeping the dps coming on the primary target.

Still are, really. Eviction gave them a bloody nose and some afk-members lost their shit, didn't change much
---
Are you in a corp dude? Sounds like you do with some help. Miasmos is used on the mining field for muti-boxers. Three barges and Miasmos is great. As you are not muti-boxing you do not have a ship that is filling it up.
---
If you can spare the $9 I would just by your first month, it take 5 times as long to get your first month then to just reknew it. I understand if that is not an option for you though. If you come out to a null sec moon you can get as much as 71 mill an hour in a venture, even more, if that more was to jackpot. 
---
Look into joining an alliance that can help you achieve your goals, there are a few good ones. Mine being Pandemic Horde, we will give you ships, skill books and try and teach you how to do what you want to do in eve. 
---
And by "teach", I mean fly both you, me and the rest of my newbeans at the enemy in our mining ships just to see if the enemy want to play.
---
Fuck I kinda don’t want to say because it’s so fucking stupid, but whatever here we go.
---
I was moving a Moros fit from high to low and got killed in the first low gate by a bhalgorn, vindi, and a Phobos (stupid already, but it gets worse). 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/63767288/
---
My knee jerk reaction was to go to jita, pull out my shiny 3b Kronos and fight them. A slow ass battleship making 13 jumps later they were still there. They engaged and took gate guns and I thought “this is it, this is my moment of revenge, I know I can tank them in this fit.” I lasted 40 seconds as they shredded me. Because of one. Simple. Glue eating. Shameful. Mistake.

Follow up on this question - why do you have a PG rig in? Were you using a rerolled Gist X-type 100mn AB instead of a Core X-type? Do you plan to make any changes to the fit?

I can second this. I joined Horde two years ago. I'm still terrible at this game, but at least I have cookies now.

T1 cruiser logi and rail moas.. very effective.. you dont need blingy t3's. Highseccers just need to start using logi and repping each other, dps ships should be buffer fitted with high resists.. problem solved.
---
You had me at pineapple pizza.

nice, what does 100+% resistance do? make you invulnerable?

Anything to help the client pre-load all the assets it needs to ensure a smooth transition before you "enter" New Eden would be super welcome.

Dumbest thing isn't one of these.

The dumbest thing I ever did was listen to a friend for years who warned me in no certain terms to *never* play this game because it was full of horrible people.

Any decent loot dropped yet?

&gt;I just don't know how we'll manage to do it again

 me either, you couldn't manage to do it while murdering their fleet how else can you pull it off?

We are still here 😁

That is the fit... pilot error losing this loki...  decided to engage a seemingly lone enyo in a bubble at 13km. Wasn't able to get my web on him quick enough. Then decloakes the gank fit t3c's... RIP Loki lol. I am going to tweak the fit and give it another go however.

If it was the jukebox unfortunately the song selection can be bad some tiles but if it was a dj it would have been requested

Awesome vid! Would a Neut on that empty High be any better on this fit? Or does the playstyle leave you to far out of range to bother ?
---
there can't be 100% res on regular hull
---
As a leader of one of the few veteran FW groups that has stuck it out, I appreciate your attention to our area of the game.  However, Citadel lockouts for militia pilots is a harmfully simplistic proposal that will not solve the core problems with FW, or lowsec in general.   
---
Instead of offering any sort of new and meaningful content to FW, citadel lockouts would be nothing more than a bandaid solution in a vain attempt to return FW to its past meta.  Here's an idea: as much as we all loved it back then, that meta is dead, and it should stay dead.   
---
FW mechanics from 5 years ago are still going to be stale and uninteresting to new and veteran players alike, whether citadel lockouts are implemented or not.  All of us want the kind of big campaigns to capture major systems to come back, but it will take a major effort to provide new and interesting things for FW pilots to fight over in order to make that happen.  I look forward to hearing any ideas you may have about what that new content should be.
---
can you link your lossmails so me and my dance troupe can re-enact them in an off-broadway surrealist musical
---
interpretive dancerbtw
---
In all honesty, if FW worked more like sov entosis mechanics it would probably work better as it would mean you have to spread out over oplexes across systems and give the defender options as to where and how to try to engage.
---
That stat is a bit misleading. They just changed how the strength of rolls is represented. Rather than being a range of, say, -50% to +20%, it is now represented on a 100% scale where the original stat is 100%. So that mod has 109.5% EM resist, meaning that it is 9.5% over the base value of 100%
---
Its a little confusing but at the same time its a little nicer as it shows the strength of the roll relative to the original roll a little better than the first system.
---
With Sansha Nation cutting ability for Triglavians to send reinforcements like how hard this could be ?
---
You're right. I mistakenly remembered heat mechanics. I probably should have re-watched the vid before linking it.
---
Fabulous words with superb intentions. But unless all of the above is on CCPs agenda, it is just empty words.
---
Yes...yes...buy all my purple mods and melt them. Let the mutiplasmids flow through you.
---
It may have been a Gist X abyssal if I remember correctly.  There will probably be some changes to the fit... I would like to get more dps out of it but still be able to apply outside of point range. Medium AC cant hit like my missiles some 70km out or better so probably will keep with the missile boat approach.
---
The best mods out there are sat on ships owned by some of the rich and good PVPers like Casper24. I know he has an abyssaled-out interceptor worth about 25-30 billion.
---
My best item is [this shield booster](https://imgur.com/gaxgAE4). Its not unstable so its not god tier, but its still really, really good.
---
I also have a [good web](https://imgur.com/JclGwZW) which gets 99% stength on a vindi. There are definitely better things out there tho with more range.
---
From what i know Aryth wants :             
---
* rorquals castrated (he advocated against introducing them)        
---
* local from upgrades only           
---
* bigger production costs (cash you pay to install jobs )       
---
* moon mining changes ( he was against current system)           
---
TBH Aryth is good candidate as in opposite to what people say about him he is not trying to make EVE for bigger blocks - simply CCP have its own agenda.
---
Although you touched on it I believe you’ve undervalued the importance of citadels in overall disengagement from FW. Especially in CalGal, 2017-18 were knock-down drag-out times with regard to citadel bashes that left sides of the wz distorted, drained, and burnt out. In order to properly fight timers we both made and phoned new friends in large numbers and then burnt those friends out. 
---
Some pretty sizable cap fights were fought, good frags were had, but in the end dealing with citadel mechanics became the only actual measure of WZ control and that killed anyone but LP farmer’s desire to engage with the mechanic. There’s just no point for an actual PVP entity to maintain WZ control when they can spam citadels if they want to maintain easy mids to push someone’s forts or indy citadels. 
---
Because citadel mechanics and the inherent n+1 nature of bashing or defending them became the name of the game, both sides called on groups able to help buff their numbers. From Snuff to Horde to BL on at least a couple occasions, it became not all that uncommon to see 300 people in local on serious citadel bash. 
---
This is not fun content to most of us lowsec scum. Our natural habitat is the 1-30 man gang. We’re fine with shiny, we’re fine with caps, but our lowsec scumbag income can’t support super numbers that the likes of Snuff bring to the table. It’s hard to match goon teat on an FW budget. Shit’s no fun. 
---
So for these reasons we called it a day. 
---
CALSF and the rest of CalMil proper left the WZ entirely, Galmil suffered massive FC burnout and did whatever they do when we aren’t there for them to talk shit at us (I miss u Nate). Shit’s a mess. Look at the decline in PVP in placid and black rise over the last 8 months. It’s pretty telling. Citadels in their current iteration are a death knell to FW.
---
This is amazing, I want a Gnosismoa

yes i second that, i m sure they have a low sec boot camp for noobs.
---
Interesting but why EVE? You can socialize in many other MMOs as well.
---
In short - TAPIrium vs PanFam. There are a few other anti-Tapirium entities, but they are not closeley connected to them and do not have the coordination Imperium and Legacy coalition have.
---
Overall, stagnation, because everyone picked a side, but numbers favor Tapirium heavily.
---
I can get behind Automatic Moon mining, as you pointed out it's how it used to happen, but I think if your going to add that then it should be open to all systems not just FW, it should be available to all space.
---
I think possibly that all moon platforms should gain a ship hanger, and the station should launch 1 of the smallest hulls in the ships hanger sending it out to mine a random rock on field, these ships should be fully fit but must be fit with one laser not two, starting with a venture, then barges, then skiff's and hulks.
---
This gives us risk vs reward, we can go cheep and use lots of ventures, or we can risk the extra ore and use Barges or if your Richy Mc Duck you can go balls deep and store Hulks in your bay.
---
If a hostile player shows up he gets to blap the miner, once killed the station should not launch another for a et period of time, set by the player, once this time elapses a fresh ship should be launched.
---
If a friendly/not friendly miner shows up the station should recall its miner, AI shouldnt be mining when a player is there mining.
---
The Russians and Mango are Legacy coalition, practically. Idk, why we pretend they are separate as they coordinate for every single major op.
---
So there's a few points to this. First off, I don't see any reason mechanics that were fun and interesting 5 years ago can't be fun now. Good mechanics are good mechanics, and time doesn't change that. We've all had a bunch of fun under them, and the main reason that fun stopped was because those mechanics changed. There's a lot of tried and true stuff that got nuked when citadel came out, and lowsec got hit the hardest by that. Restoring at least some of that old capability is, to me, a good way to go about starting the process of fixing things.
---
When I'm developing my platform, I try to focus on things that are reasonably possible within the next couple years. That's not to say that I expect they will be accomplished, just as a general bar of 'should I include this.' There's a lot of long term things, all the way up to a rewrite of the game to allow for multithreading, that I would like to see, but that's on the scale of many years of labor. Instead, my aim is for things that are reasonable to happen in the short to mid term, because that's a lot of where the CSM has an effect. It's rare that you're able to give feedback on things 5 years in the future, but CCP does tend to bring up stuff one year in the future. Therefore, when trying to demonstrate what my feedback points would be, I shoot for things that CCP could potentially bring up to the CSM.
---
With that in mind, these changes are intentionally more short term. A bottom up mechanics rework would likely be a year or two of pure dedication, similar to how citadels were, ironically. The goal here is to get FW to a point where more people are active in FW, and therefore it shows more value to CCP than it does currently, meaning it's more viable for them to take that year or two of focus. You can't just go from zero to hero, there are stepping stones between it.
---
Too far to bother. Was thinking a t2 salvager for those elite wrecks lol
---
Without reading the comments of this post, I want to make the observation that you listed a bunch of stuff that "the system" that is the eve economy and passtime of veterans occupy themselves with.
---
Take it from me - perhaps try doing your own thing. Few days ago I was running around wspace doing whatever the fuck without a fuck given, past two days I've meen FCing fleets because I felt like it and basically nobody was concerned with OMG GIB ME ISK I WANT ISK. 
---
Do something *Else,* dude. eve is literally just a bunch of parts and tools. throw a wrench in there. I didn't get all my unique experiences in eve by doing whatever someone else was doing.

Put 1.5 bil in a no tank, no stabs Itty V and gated it blind from Jita to O-V. Nearly made it too, died in BWF, one jump bridge from my destination, when a navy slicer jumped into BWF at the same time as me, making the one gate I did have scouted still unsafe, since as soon as I decloaked the slicer also decloaked and then killed me
---
elite pilots don't need defensive neuts lol
---
And get immediately suicide ganked upon undock
---
You have my vote, sir. I've been an active FW player. I quit Eve because I had enough chasing Ventures. So, you're the hope for lots of people who enjoy Faction Warfare.  FW was a forgotten topic for many years, make FW great again!
---
I have an absolutely amazing 5mn microwarpdrive. 
---
The downside is no one wants to spend 500 mil on a frigate sized module and I’m definitely not undocking with that much in my ship unless I’m doing absolutely everything to avoid pvp
---
The Initiative launched a surprise attack (With no help from goons at all btw.)
---
Alliances go to die in Cloud Ring. It is known.
---
I would love to listen to these types of interviews while flying. I’m imagining an eve nightly news with a cheesy broadcaster and intro jingle now lol
---
Can confirm, bought the first Zarmazd to hit the market and instantly regretted undocking it, it lived and I took it on a Zarvox roam the next day. It's still alive in my 4-4 hangar.
---
FW Militias have a lot of great things to offer, especially for new players.  My alliance (Villore Accords) is one of the oldest in the Gallente militia, and among the most active player groups in faction warfare.  If you'd like, come check out out discord. We have a ton of people new and old who can answer questions about militia stuff and EVE in general.

---
10% increased EM resist is worht over 30 bill? people offering alot of money on it on the forums. why?
---
I've played a LOT of MMOs and aside from my first one, (Ultima Online pre-Trammel), they were all missing something.
---
Sense of loss when you died? 
---
Being able to attack other players with a chance to take their equipment?
---
I dunno... WoW was fun for awhile, but I guess I pushed my raid group too hard? Some quit, then got pissed when we couldn't clear content because we were having to PUG 1-3 people because no one wanted to recruit for our guild.
---
Always kept wanting to give EvE a fair shot. My first round, I got recruited by a low sec pirate Corp, brand new to the game. Said they'd offer to train me, and I was left on my own, no one ever responding in Corp chat.
---
Second go around? Joined a much larger Corp, several hundred people. Always someone to talk to, but no one wanted to do group content. Ended up getting war decd and again, no one wanted to group and fight off attackers consistantly. A few times we scrounged up maybe 4-5 people out of the dozens wed have online. Got tired of logging in, no one in our home system because most people were scared of losing ships and took off dozens of jumps away, leaving some of us newbs (at this point I had maybe 2-3 months under my belt) to fend for ourselves, with no organization from the top.
---
Third go around? I wanted to try null, but it was more of the same from the first attempt. Renter Corp for a single bull system. Got bored fast because again, the few people running the Corp had their own things going on and didnt seem to care much about growing new members. Basically they got tax money from my crabbing and bought my ore. Boring.
---
This time I tried something different. Started over from scratch and decided to play it slow. Started with exploration, branched off to indy. Saved up enough for an extractor, and drained my former "main", selling an injector, purchasing more extractors, etc. Transferred about 12m SP to my new guy and havent looked back.
---
I've done a bit of FW (a lot of opinions on this). I mine/produce my own stuff, aside from T2 which is neigh impossible being in high sec, and yet needed to compete.
---
I guess it's the lure of meeting new people, and progressing to that next ship, that first station for my Corp, etc.
---
Also helps that when I run fleet ops, I like to get my drink on and just have fun. My first OP, I took a small group into a WH. First time for some. Nearly finish our first sleeper site and someone mentions in comms other ships are coming up in dscan. I basically tell everyone we arent leaving u til the site is done, and if we die, well, we die fighting and get some pvp experience.
---
I proceed to loose the first hurricane I built after popping a T2 destroyer. A guy in our fleet immediately warps off as soon as enemies land on grid (still irritates me because I think we all would've lived had he not). I still had fun I  that op.
---
Today, I BSd for a bit with a guy just getting back from a trip to Russia while we tried out the new trig invasion (perimeter). I lost a cruiser, came back in a BC, salvaged a few wrecks, killed some trigs while we learned how it works. 
---
Just not the same experience I get in other MMOs. More rewarding, even when I loose.
---
Lived in WH space for 5 years. PvP every single day. Never seen anyone from V0LTA. Not even once.
---
Cornak4CSM!
---
That Censoring ... did literally nothing
---
[Serious]
---
I'm curious... What do you do all day in Eve? (I'm not going to assume from the CODE flair that you're a high barge ganker 😉) While null sec is far from perfect in terms of hand mechanics, I know of nothing else in Eve that is less irrelevant...
---
I agree with this guy from code 100%
---
I'm shocked appalled.
---
This. Are there LITERALLY any rewards for fighting AT ALL?...
---
Liberal Nazi...Fucking lol mate.
---
You can't put the cat back in the bag with citadels, and that's exactly what a docking access lockout is.  At this point what I'm seeing from you is not a challenge to CCPs major problems with how they've approached FW, but doubling down on reinforcing the kind of thinking that caused their past mistakes. Short term proposals.  Exactly as I said before, bandaids.  And misguided bandaids at that.
---
You SHOULD be pushing for an overhaul of FW.  That's what FW needs. 
---
Just locking people out of their citadels isn't going to bring pilots back to FW, and in my opinion that proposal shows you haven't really considered the issue in sufficient depth to be an effective advocate.  Btw, you should check out the FW Committee discord if you'd like to engage with the community with further discussion of these issues.
---
Just remove Nullsec! Now that would have been an interesting angle.
---
hey leave the gay frogs out of this

Linearly came here to post this.

maxed aeon on higsec pirate char

Makes you explode with any damage, as its not set up to handle negative numbers for damage, so they roll round and become very large numbers. (See twos complement for details)

Happens in some wormholes, with dsts.

They occasionally drop the datacores needed for T2 Trig ships.

I sold two for 120 mil each.

I've heard BPCs and skill books drop from them too.

I'll launch a surprise attack on your internet hahaha
---
FW pilots have been asking for changes to the plex timers for YEARS, without any success, much to the frustration of all.  
---
There are many proposals, dual timers for each side, timer rollbacks, timer resets... basically anything to achieve the goal you stated: a disincentive for the farmers to just abandon their plex every time a wartarget shows up.  Any CSM candidate who seeks to represent FW interests would be well served to look at the plex timer issue and get behind these popular proposals.  Adopting almost any of them would be an improvement.

Weird. I flew through just fine in a harbinger earlier.

1 million ISK/Hour? Doing Relic sites? Is he completing a single container an hour?

This is great!

I think I will check out the VERY POWERFUL CORP, in case, heaven forbid, I incur the wrath of this capsuleer in the future.
---
Also, can I order a Gnosismoa as well before they are out of stock?
---
So far, these are the good loot drops and salvage from the incursions.
---
* Datacore - Triglavian Quantum Engineering &lt;-- Loot
---
* Lattice Locked Dekaisogen &lt;-- Salvage

* Radiation Absorption Thruster &lt;--Salvage
---
* Singularity Radiation Convertor&lt;--Salvage
---
* Triglavian Survey Database &lt;--Loot
---
* Trinary State Processor &lt;--Salvage

* Zero-Point Field Manipulator &lt;--Salvage
---
* Encryption Skillbook &lt;-- Loot
---
AT 2019 cancelled... No more AT ever!
---
Except i blindly trust it will be back next year
---
Yeah, thus far most of my good stuff has been the salvage.
---
The RNG on loot has been piss poor for me. 
---
ONE non-empty wreck...
---
Some systems i tend to "glitch out" in, everything becomes some kind of foggy blue colour and i get stuck in the "jumping" tunnel, cant issue commands but overview loads. Urlen in particular.
---
i warped a frighter  ( i was suspect so dident want to jump in to hi-sec) to a bait fortizar in low-sec knowing it was bait (free port then when you land on grid they remover freeport and kill you)
---
"i bet i can dock before they see me" 
---
nope, i did get to see a titan and a doomsday before i died, only nice thing is that the azbel i stole 1 min before dident drop :-)
---
First just login as alpha (you don't need to subscribe) and check your assets tab, you will see if you still have suff in some J system.
---
If you still do, check Zkill for that system, to see which corps hangs around there nowdays.
---
You can always try contracting stuff to them at 75% price
---
that usually sells
---
It's worth it even as an alpha. 
---
If you don't know where to start go on a few spectre fleet roaams or bombers bar, talk with some people etc.
---
You can easily login once or twice a week, go on a fleet or two and have fun.
---
everyone (mostly) using avatars, em damage Doomsday,
---
You can set your death clone to remote HQ of a corp once every 6 months.
---
So you can just death clone to them, and most corps have local contracts/markets and some kind of JF service.  You can be there in 5 min.
---
people will.....the Frigate AT ships, rich garmur pilots, advertise it somewhere
---
I never comment on a ship loss. Salt is what these people want and they will not get it from me.
---
It’s often an inconvenience to lose a ship but that’s EVE. If losing a ship is unacceptable being in EVE was the wrong choice to make.
---
In the end you’re only ever going to do one thing: get a new boat and carry on. You might as well save yourself the time, the hassle, the emotional burden of mewling about losing the boat.
---
The only thing I ever found annoying about losing a ship was where I got an email from the guy blowing up the boat, insisting on how I had to feel so sad about losing the boat and that he felt bad about it but hey, this is EVE, you have to take the losses as they come. Mind you, at that time I’m about 4 to 5 years his senior in EVE, I kind of understand what the deal is by now.
---
People insisting I have to feel bad about losing the boat is way more of a nuisance than actually losing the boat. I have tens of ships and loads of BPs to make more. Losing a ship, honestly, it’s just not that big of a deal.
---
I have pages on pages of lost ships. I’ll lose many more ships, it is the firm expectation. Trying to harvest tears about that is a wasted effort. I just don’t care enough about ships.
---
Oh god, you loose your ship and then seek customer help desk just to loose your shit. It was so good it should be verbalised! Great great trolling work!
---
A fair correction.
---
:sad trombone:
---
Put a Loki hull, SFI, Wolf and Manticore with all the fittings/subsystems/rigs into an untanked Ity V and tried to fly it a few jumps in high sec, got popped by a suicide Tornado.
---
Not enough turrets, mining apoc ftw
---
The problem isn’t that there’s been ineffective bandaids. The problem is there have been 0 bandaids, or anything other than unintentional sideswipes by CCP when rebalancing other areas of the game. CCP has paid exactly no attention in the past few years, so opening up that initial attention paved the way for bigger things, and gives people a sign that hey, FW isn’t being ignored.
---
I invite you to read the other components of my post, which contain my suggestions beyond citadel lockout. I fully agree that citadel lockouts are not the sole problem with Faction Warfare, which is why I included a reasonably comprehensive set of solutions, while still keeping them viable within that short to medium term span. Check them out, and let me know how you feel. 
---
I’m always happy to pop into any sort of discord.
---
This sounds AWFUL, to be honest. When doing invasions in a fleet, especially public fleet, how in the hell you divide the loot? Even if you do manage it, im sure it will become non profitable real quick
---
My thoughts were "This HAS to be bait, no one scans for relic sites in a Moa with combat scanners...." Turns out Occasionally, it really is true
---
Just read the pastebin, I was shaking with laughter :-).
---
It’s amazing how some people simply do not get it.
---
When did the ballot become even remotely mandatory?...
---
He doesnt "roleplay" the evil Goon. Everytimes he talks you can see his ego coming out its mouth. Coming with while spy master thing which is just "wait for someone to be bored of its alliance" and you just have a hatable figure.

Glassing is a reference to the Covenant from halo.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/btr54v/the\_glassing\_of\_tribute/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/btr54v/the_glassing_of_tribute/)
---
As I just said, it isn't
---
I threw together a 30m t1 cruiser fit and was able to take on the small groups of rats on gates just fine. As long as you don't fight the big blobs with battleship rats you don't really need bling or a fleet.
---
That makes no sense something like this should start in null. Wtf happened to concord they just let it happen?
---
Join RvB. We got young players and old farts. :)

what price it can have? i know until there is buyer... but atleast +-?

That's when you start spazzing on standing fleet comms for people to come rescue you.

TIL Hilmar is an idiot.
---
"I think the first mistake was to un-symmetrify the mineral distribution, where people became self-sufficient for their resource acquisition in each region. The game was actually completely designed to be the reverse, so that you would never be self-sufficient, so you would have to have access to the whole map, either through aggression or pact-making."
---
Players solved this through trading at Yulai, and later Jita.
---
If, for arguments sake, you took all the Noxcium away from Delve and adjoining regions, then it'd take maybe a tenth of a second for the jump freighters to be loaded.
---
ratting needs to be done with or for a purpose.
---
* to help keep nullsec sov easier to defend (ratting does this) 
---
* saving up for that expensive ship, skillbook, plex account maybe once with ingame money
---
Strat ops
---
* strat ops in the smaller groups, lowsec groups care a little less about spys if this bothers you why they hide info after all thier hard work. alot of work, also piloting skills help in smaller ships on the big fleets, and that only comes with learning and time.
---
Solo PvP
---
* yes, solo pvp is incredicbly hard to come by, its pretty much why lowsec still has life, because solo pvp fights are obtainable on a consistant basis.
---
* there are non T2 ships that fight with the big boys IE Fed Navy Comet and the cookie cutter fit on it / Arty Firetail. If T2 ships wernt just that little bit better what would be the reason or reward for paying for them or training for them? its like complaining the best gear is only unlockable at a higher level in WoW or whatever or however they work it.
---
* watch streamers, fighting outnumbered, using the map to your advatage to find the solo smaller number fights is a skill in itself. learn it and dont whatever you do think, ill fly around aimlessly like a lost puppy and get the fight i want. frigate and destroyers are good at one thing, choosing fights, learn how to choose your fight.
---
Mining
---
* it is what it is, ive tried it, all types of mining, not for me, no bother i made a little money, its easy, easy way to earn isk while you train for your first 6months to a year to be able to do anything useful, for now, learn how harsh eve is, and after a year of subcap training youll start to be competative, even without all level 5 skills.
---
* Think of mining as your entry point into PvP - it pays for ships, fits, losses, skillbooks, and if you grind it out, skill injectors, even the little injectors will help accelerate things for you early on. careful as it is addictive like IRL drugs, but hell does it speed things up.
---
Events/CCPlz/Updates
---
* its a well known thing CCP are pretty bad with patches, and have made some pretty astonishing changes and choices along the road. but ill be honest, after playing eve for 5 years, they have kept it fresh (used to do a better job than now atm)
---
* new ships, modules, abyssal space, attempts at UI changes to freshen the game for daily players, they do put work into the game wether well recieved or not, give them credit for this unlike ie StarCitezen
---
* the events also, is not actually that old, so theres plenty of fuckups to be made, enjoy laughing at them, and just play what you enjoy and dont play what you thinks shit. theyll see the data and progress (we hope)
---
Reddit and Eve
---
* Careful, too much reddit reading on eve can destroy the game, when reddit community complain alot about eve, i find myself not wanting to play the game, it can ruin the game by highlighting the bits you maybe would not of noticed for example. amungst other things, and i think if r/eve was closed for a quarter, people migh enjoy the game more.
---
Summery, keep at it, i did, and i thought it sucked early on, but it was so well worth the wait to continue learning past knowing and learning how to surcome the things you post about here. i love logging in, being able to fly literally anything in the game, on multiple toons, self sufficiant, and can move aound eve alliances to how i fancy playing for 4-6months
---
Ya thats what i meant
---
If bastion makes it on this list I think CVA diserves at leat an honorable mention. They are unique enough to be interesting even if they are no longer a powerhouse.
---
ECM Burst will do the job, but you can't be too close to the gate.
---
I’m still fairly fresh and stupidly thought skills were everything. So I grinded hardcore in hi-sec for my first billion isk and wisely spent it on implants. I was fitting out a new ship and the afterburner I needed was in 0.3. My first venture to low-sec. I was scared but still newb enough to not d-scan or even know what to look for. Plus my PVE fitted rifter would surely be fine. I was also using autopilot for maximum gains. I got one shotted and podded maybe two seconds before my docking request would of went out. 
---
I just went back to Hek and started grinding away again. I feel I failed in giving content. I should of went mental at that guy and set my powerful Corp on his ass. Fucking regrets. I hate this game.
---
Nice PHD. I hope somebody reddit. See what I did there? Sorry I'm drunk. Probs a good post, unlike my shitpost.
---
But but but, he was a POWERFUL corp!
---
I mean, when I went after him, I didn't think it would escalate as much as it did otherwise I would have tried to record it and put it on youtube. I do miss using the Enforcers though.... They were super fun to fly but a pain in the but to lose.
---
my hyperion has over 1k with t1 cargo rigs ( i had it for more than 10 years now :D)
---
Opened reddit in hopes of finding quality posts.
---
if nobody will pay 500m...it's not worth 500m.
---
Ive looked at ecm burst and its ecm ratings are about 7 across teh board. looking at a simple cruiser and its about 15. does ecm not have to match the signal strength?
---
WTF of course TEST was involved in all that, that doesn't mean it's obvious that supers coming south on TEST backyard was obviously going to generate a major conflict.
---
&gt; You're also assuming test babysitting them was a reaction to supers being moved "south"
---
No I'm not.
---
:-)
---
There’s a system in Everywhere where I bought some crystals to mine with.
---
To get there, you have to go through one low-sec system. I had a brand spanking new Thorax, the most expensive ship I had had up to that moment. It was so expensive that I actually gave it what looked like a decent fit, I was so proud o it.
---
I had it for about 20 minutes. It died in 30 seconds or so. I rolled my eyes so hard at that one.
---
I had zero combat skills. If I hit at all, I hit for 5 damage. Like rapping the hull with your knuckles. Completely useless.
---
Today that would no longer be true. I have learned a few things since then.
---
If you sort your dscan window by distance things that are warpable but off grid will appear at the bottom making managing it easier.
---
If you hold alt you can adjust the distance of your probe's scan with the mouse wheel. 
---
If you hold V and click on an anom from your probe scanner or a celestial from your overview it will dscan in that direction without you having to manually adjust your camera and then click the dscan button.
---
even though people already do so with rorqs
---
With those figures you'd have a 46.67% chance to jam the target.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Electronic_Countermeasures#ECM_Mechanics
---
Add the pirate factions to fw but with a few small changes, 0 LP rewards and no LP store. That way if you fight for one of them its all about the pew pew and not being meta gamed for the greatest payday. 
---
Back in the day the devs told us at fanfest that it was a simple task to add new factions to fw as it was already coded to do just that.
---
Some small change that could maybe happen if a pirate militia held a system maybe that the sentry guns switch off on gates.
---
ECM is chance based. If you have 7 strength and he has 15 sensor, you have a 50% chance to jam in your optimal.
---
Thanks for the info guys, with a bit of luck these being farmed a lot will drive down the price of T2 Trig ships ... I want that HAC!
---
Wow! You should sell this amazing never before seen ship thats more rare than a guardian vexor! Youll get so much money!
---
That would be the normal reality for me :)
---
To be honest this "invasion cleared", to me, sounds like CCP did not actually finish making the 2nd level invasion, so things ends at stage 1.
---
There are localization lines about "Fleets" of invasions that have a "suggested player number", however now we've seen none of them?
---
If we can "stop" this invasion in stage 1 by ratting the triglavian NPCs, and stage 2 never happens... This does not sound right for a game mechanism. It means to reach stage 2 players have to ignore the stage 1?
---
You freighted it one jump in highsec!? What the f*ck lol, why
---
In lowsec with low skills using unbonused combat scanners. Yeah that sounds about right.
---
I've had two three hour sessions, first session i took dps and made nothing, due to not being able to get to the wrecks fast enough. Next session i took a Hawk, salvagers in the highs, made about 30m per hour in salvage. It will get better once you have organised groups with a fair loot distribution after the fleet, not worth it whilst its a free for all and people join the fleet to literally just salvage not helping dps / logi wise.
---
Yeah I know it's wccftech but still :)
---
But you know that materials in EVE are still region locked - in terms of moon goo.         
---
Like you need to trade them as some areas have plenty of one type of mineral while other totally lack it.         
---
The only single difference is that you don't have Technetium showing just in north.
---
What is a PL?
---
Trust would be moving it without collatoral.  This is just another courier.
---
Also, tell Sig the spam mail roleplay is still over the top.
---
Haha that would make sense
---
If you don't have an insta off the 4-4 undock, do you really play eve?
---
And the thing for me, he legit believed the Wingspan gag and I guess thought he had a right to be unmolested. Or a twelve year old was playing. One of the two.
---
That's if over 100%, I'm not sure if anyone has ever tested with 100% on the nose (not that I think getting 100% exactly would be practically possible.
---
Hey, do you prefer this or the 100mn Loki ?
---
While i have no idea why are they doing it, staging systems with lvl4 sec agents are always high-traffic. So, it could be nice to get them some love. 
---
But then again, this is CCP...
---
Nice eye bleach
---
It still should have been called exterminatus
---
Apparently.

Fuck I love WiNGSPAN
---
TBH i know people that play eve 2-3 times a month.    
---
They login do few lvl 4 missions to shoot some rats, take a ships do few jumps die or kill something and logout for like 10 days as they simply don't have any time for anything more.
---
OK, so basically I have a chance of getting out alive. Lol
---
Yeah, i almost had a few of my friends convinced to do it like this. But then they sadly decided, that EvE is not worth playing with such a low time commitment and they all quit to spend their time with games that actually get them something in that ammount of time. :(
---
Sad truth is, that EvE is mainly a game for otherwise lifeless beings like i am.
---
FW corp living in Scalding Pass as Frat pets who occasionally camp the regional gates in their space but run from 4-man gangs. Worse in PvP than Evan McLean and they mass-recruit everybody in Jita, no hands turned down.
---
If you thought ASCEE has low recruiting standards, in Conoco you found somebody lowering the bar deep enough that you need to dig a hole to find it again.
---
Now all 3 are gone, lol
---
Focusing on new players to the point of completely neglecting or even alienating older players is a disturbing trend in mmos. It says to me "we just want your money for starting up, once we have that you can go to hell."
---
Aaaaand it's gone...
---
We should help the triglavians invade, we should impede the people running the invasions.
---
Dumpster Rejects
---
Welcome back to LS. I am expecting solo fights ONLY ;)
---
What a heavy threat
---
It didn’t read like a 12-year-old, but someone a few years older who has not yet had enough of life’s experience to understand the subtext.
---
This is why I keep saying EVE is not a game for children. You have to have lived a little to understand the subtleties that are impervious to the understanding of young children.
---
Clicking the buttons and doing pew pew, that’s something the kids will understand. As soon as you go meta, especially when there is some subtlety involved, something that requires some knowledge of history, that’s too big of an ask for a kid to understand.
---
I warped to gate in a 2.4Bil bling fit Vargur before logging into discord or mumble. There was a fleet on the other side of the gate.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/55334941/
---
This was 5 days after I lost the same Vargur to rats because I DC'd (this was reimbursed by CCP)
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/55266316/
---
I just want to point out that if you ever had a look at the 4-4 descan you would recognized that most of the time you have a set of combat probes out and it does not take a lot to gank a fraught it being a DD
---
First question: 
---
&gt; I know for a fact there’s a bunch of people asking for walking around in space stations, which was teased recently. Do you have a plan for that in the near future?
---
lol
---
They know it's easier to get new players to pay money than it is to make bittervets happy.
---
What does that have to do with anything? They’re saying people wouldn’t bother separating out all of their omega accounts with vms, vps and separate emails just to get more CSM votes.
---
The second part of your sentence kinda sounded like that though. Didnt know you're not free to say who you voted for even if theyre not on the ballot these days.
---
Well this was an absolute trash of an "interview". The only thing that made this even remotely appear recent was the question about Brisc. The rest of the questions are all just shitty rehashes of stuff that's been repeated for the last 3 years.
---
The dumbest thing I’ve ever done in EVE is a while back now and I’m still so embarrassed by it that even today I can’t mention it.
---
You know you’re your own worst enemy when you think you’re being smart but you’re actually doing something extremely stupid.
---
I’ll leave it at that. Bob have mercy on my poor soul.
---
/Actually, my fuck up predates K space by a good number of years.
---
Are you sure you will be able to fly it when you are unable to google such an easy question?
---
It’s not a problem finding EVE Online.
---
The problem is coming to the understanding that ‘yeah, I like this place’ and you don’t mind all the shenanigans because you’re not a whiny little bitch.
---
Then EVE cackles wildly and goes ‘Another one who’ll never leave me’.
---
Gilas are not ideal for Dark filaments. You want a missile based platform, the Cerberus or Sacrilege being preferred for T4/T5. You can use a HAM Caracal Navy Issue for T3 and below though.
---
&gt;than it is to make bittervets happy.
---
it's pretty easy to make bittervets happy
---
I thought this was a good idea.
---
https://i.imgur.com/x16Z3ml.jpg
---
It wasn't.
---
lol prepare for extirpation
---
Its dead
---
I'm considering to return and this sounds fun! I guess its a free for all and could get ganked, right?
---
To elaborate a bit on the answers given here. Yes it can be a good choice to do so in order to get into PvP quickly but there are some downsides you need to be aware of especially as a new player:
---
1. Once you are a member of a militia, members of enemy militias can attack you anywhere without npc repercussions.
---
2. Read up on Fw and make sure you know what actions cause you to lose stanging with empire factions. If you do not know yet what you'd like to become and aren't planning on using alts then losing faction standing early on can come bite you in the ass further down the line.
---
3. Read up on security status and what actions affect it for the same reason as faction standings, although security status is much easier to fix.
---
tfw it was still probably twice as cheap as 1 of them now
---
It's no less hassle than when the launcher forgets all of your accounts.
---
You can, just don't shout about it.
---
I have never seen a wormholer actually taking a fight. It's either attacking defenceless ships or kiting bullshit that runs the moment they are in trouble. Talk about risk averse jesus christ the wormholers are full of it
---
Funny man with absolute terrible knowledge of the actual game.
---
[/u/Jibrish/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jibrish/) or any mod still active
---
remove those stone age links like ISK the guide and others
---
No, other players cannot attack you without repercussions
---

---
Interesting, I have only pvped in WHs for two hours, but I saw V0lta
---
So much for the "invasion"....
---
Would a max skilled PVE Tengu do well in these incursions?
---
The best way to deal with scrams and bubbles in a dst is a good scout.
---
join a public fleet
---
Do it on a seperate character, its gonna bork standings with two of the four empires
---
it will get worse since all the isk will be shared between 50 people
---
Gila is not good for dark. It is good for exotic because of its bonus to kinetic and thermal. Same can be said for firestorm but improved armor makes it slover. Lastly it is good for gamma because the bonus to shield makes it very tanky. 
---
If you have never done it before, dont fly a Gila unless you are comfy with t2 sites. Fly a caracal and get used to mechanics.
---
Yo, Cornak, you have my vote.
---
I offer you a recommendation to incentivize all of high sec to support the FW space:
---
**Please recommend that high sec taxes are tied to their faction's tier standing.**
---
As an example, Tier 1 for 24th Crusade = 3% minimal sales taxes in all Amarr NPC stations; Tier 5 = 0% in all amarr NPC stations.
---
I guarantee you that the major traders and null sec alt traders will either personally 1) fund half of all FW activity or 2) fund the opposing factions just to keep the smaller traders in their personal citadels.
---
Whatever happens, most of New Eden's traders will take a keen interest in the funding of faction warfare on a level far beyond that of the Ferox massacres of the Test/Horde/IChooseYou plex battles.
---
It's a massive steaming pile of shit Corp that invites every new bro in the Caldari factional war channel and then goes silent.  A lot of those 4000 members are new players that are inactive that they scared away from the game.
---
100 on the nose, would probably be invulnerable. But even several nines gets you there
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN8O5Jlcjgs
---
you can use a regular caracal for t3
---
Well now you're legally obliged to do so.
---
Very discrete shipping you have there. Definitely going to help attract customers.
---
I came here vertically to be specific.
---
Who killed a kitten?
---
Thanks for answering the questions!
---
I have another question about 2 - I heard about two major coalitions, the North and the South, with one side having the Goons and the other having the Horde, Which side is currently the losing side?
---
Unoriginal? Yes. A valid point? Also yes.
---
How do you not die to a gate camp?
---
Or they just keep track of who the neutral alts are and react to everybody except them.
---
PLA/goons are running about a bit, PANINE (I think) live in Asakai and are always good for fights. If solo / small gang is your thing, then BR is good, not fantastic, but a lot better than it was.
---

  Looks like the bloke is still losing ships in lowsec as of 16th March this year
---
I sold an Astero BPO a long time ago. Probably didn't realise its worth at the time but been playing again for a bit over a year now and kick myself almost every day over it
---
Shitty corp that lives in scalding pass and immediately accepted my obvious spy alt...but their intel channels suck too so..
---
nice to see you guys back in business
---
&gt; With CCP actually indicating they might finnaly pit work into FW
---
  Yep myself and a bunch of others put pressure onto the devs at Eve Down Under to look at FW- Give an incentive to blow up player ships over sites/missions- Increase the LP maybe? But it seems they are finally getting the message and starting to look at it.
---
That's actually syndicate.
---
It's a mistake
---
Founding corp of Pandemic Horde, I think. Don't think they are around anymore.
---
From video description:
---
&gt; I am trying to push the limits of these ships to combat the **dying skill of solo/small gang pvp**
---
Maybe calm down there a little bit lol
---
The Tengu will always hold a special place in my heart because I flew it as a new player back in 2011. But the Loki, with the new changes, better fits my flying style.
---
Jesus wept.
---
Because in Iceland shots expensive as fuck and a better job is working at a College. 
---
Still could find someone onlin with some credentials but I'd say it's far and few between
---
They litterally invite everyone every day. When i was fighting them they still invited my main twice into their corp without noticing.
---
This is a darwinist corp that believes in letting EVE break the weak. Its also majoritarily russians.
---
extract
---
OP is the customer.
---
Flaaaaaaaaaairrz are real.
---
Undock -&gt; Jump -&gt; Dock, what an accomplishment. 
---
Never mind the fact that you have to have suffered brain-damage to lose a freighter anywhere in this game, it's frightening that people think there is any kind of risk involved in this.
---
PANINE would be referring to the Pannion Domin, we get some fairly good content.

I stand corrected
---
Ya, good guys, skilled pilots. Lived in Asakai with you the last couple months :)
---
So very true, if we matched fleet sizes the outcome would suprise many I feel :)
---
Thanks man, appreciate the info on it. I'll see about logging on and taking a look. Would you think I should contact the Corp and see about selling it to them or just put up a contract to then and let them find it?
---
&gt;None of them on the gates scram,
---
I've seen Anchoring trigs land on gate. I don't know if they were the spawn for the gate or were cashing someone and just landed on the gate but i have seen the anchoring trigs on gate.
---
I too am a new player, i tried StarCitizen, left because there is no loss penalty atm in the game, i tried Elite Dangerous, left because of the same reasons, you couldn't actually destroy another players stuff because of solo/private mode and the fact that they can always run away so i came to eve and i'm having a blast (pun intended). Fun in eve ... well it depends on your definition of fun, for me fun is getting together with a bunch of people and shooting other players stuff till it goes boom or we go boom and then laugh about it and also the permanence of territory is a big plus for me, i like expanding our territory and actually having a lot of land (space).
---
I bought a machariel with all my ısk and took her to lvl4 while my corp is in wardec. Got blown in 15 minutes. Quit the game for years came back after a long time and moved to null.
---
Do not use a Gila for Darks. Just dont.
---
Darks nerf turret range so that includes drone turrets, so your drones will orbit outside of their range trying to shoot targets moving way dfaster than they can (due to the speed buff).
---
Gilas can do anything but Darks, for Darks you want a sacrileige or a Cerberus.
---
Gila can do darks but you need quite a lot of application mods to make it work alright.
---
On the plus side, with AB you almost dont evne need to tank and free to collect loots. 
---
Go for RLMLs; C-type or better Pith Medium booster, 10MN AB (preferably faction or rolled) cap mods, omniresist, and 1 of each drone omnidirectional mods, comp and enchancer. Rest is damage or more cap
---
Not perfect but very reliable.
---
Start killing them with the neutral Alta.
---
Checked zkill and didn't find and losses, so there might be hope. I didn't even know that stuff would show there. I'm at the point but where I want to see about starting fresh, sell as much crap as I can and look at my options. I don't get much time to okay consistently, but I really miss the game.
---
Depends how rounding on damage works. Maybe 0.00001 damage units = 1.
---
random rat. Loot EVERYTHING.
---
Got an unstable large auxiliary shield booster multiplasmoid from loot
---
One of the few people that go for csm that I trust to make the game better.
---
You can delay your entry into local by blocking certain ports.
---
Turret (or Missile Launcher) hardpoints are fixed and unchangeable per ship.
---
When I split HAMs/RLML, they called me a madman. But blapping tackle without losing a lot of DPS feels very good.

I thought Astero could only be build from dropped BPCs? Where the BPO from?
---
I don't understand why CCP doesn't put the minimal amount of effort in to add a new mission every few weeks or something to keep the hordes of level 4 missions runners in the game. I use to think they were bad for the game but at this point any additional player is a positive for the ecosystem.
---
I also wonder why they never even thought to add more variety of missions too such as escort missions or something besides the standard kill or fetch quest.

Wthat the fuck did i just watch. Is the circus in town?

This looks like a showcase of what dying skill in solo/small gang looks like
---
&gt;numbers favor Tapirium heavily
---
bit of an understatement there. DinoGoon and Panfam numbers look like this; (just on main alliance numbers alone  [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/memberCount](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/memberCount)  )
---
Goons 34141  Dinos 17260  Init 5231 Total 56632
---
Hordelings 17181 NC 3861  PL 2325  Total 23367
---
Now I know there's going to be a whole bunch of "oh most of those guys are krabs" nonsense, but the numbers still don't lie. The main alliances involved are these six. Once you start adding in all the coalition members the numbers don't get any better for Panfam. 
---
I'm not going to get into the parallels between this war (whatever it's being called this time) and World War Bee (we won we got to pick the name - besides Casino War is a trash name. Goons will pick this one, make it witty) that's already being argued extensively in other threads.
---
Is this a thing?!
---
If you attack a citadel, how much information does the owner get about the bash? Does he get informed about as soon as the citadel is shot? Does he know who attacked his citadel and with what ship? Does he know how many pilots were involved in the bashing?
---
This made me laugh hard:
---
&gt;why was i "munitioned"
---
Jumped a loaded freighter into lowsec
---
Ooooh there are a couple.  Moving a JF through Faspera would be one.  But let me go back to 2013.   I finally had the skills to rat.  So, my 8 month toon bought a Armageddon NI, which was at least half T1 fit.  I was bored and dicking around on the K-616 gate in F-T in Delve.  An Arazu decloaks.   I might have been able to make it to the gate but I didn’t think to do it, but I decide to engage.   The rest is history.  I’m sure I have other stories that would rival this.
---
I also think some of my best times and Eve were doing stupid shit. I miss being able to play as much as I used to.

The target painters are offline, just serve as heatsinks for overheating. The other option would be a cap injecting small shield booster fit. The idea is just to out run all the DPS and don't get tackled. We run dark sites in these. Two pilots is plenty. Maybe one pilot could do it, but if you got bad spawn you probably wouldn't have enough dps. I think three of them could run a T2 site, but I can't get two of my brothers to play at the same time to see. lol
---
Do you have the lossmail? If it's the system I'm thinking of there might be a chance that I know the guys who shot ya'.

They do when you trap them on the wrong sides of their hole.

Hit self destruct on my Hel, thought I selected safe log off and got distracted by daughter at the same time. Boom.
---
I bought a 500mio cargo hold II because I misclicked in the market window and didnt pay too much attention.
---
Packed billions worth of inventory in a bestower and undocked.
---
And if I were happier, I'd throw more money at them.
---
I think I might still have it. I haven’t lost all that many Thoraxes, they were never my favourite ship. But it’s a LONG time ago though. I’m not shy about the system though. My map says it has to have been Groothese, which is an 0.3, and the reason for being there was that the system where the crystals [after all these years still] are is Olide, an 0.7 system.
---
I thought it would have been Alachene, an 0.3, but that can’t be right because you can navigate around that to get to other systems. I would not have chosen a path through low-sec if I could just move around it.
---
Yep, just a matter of how fast you wanna finish
---
Add Brave and other Legacy members. They do not participate in the war in the north, but make sure for huge timers they will turn up at Goon's side. Same for whatever's left of Garbage of the Galaxy in the north.
---
I didnt read all the logs and im not going to. But holy this guy is obviously new and you're making fun of him. But hey didn't expect much more from wingspan anyway.
---
DED LP is coming, this is just the start/.
---
no
---
Looks like it's too late for that.
---
I rejected a conoco app once. Biggest mistake of my life.
---
Honestly that sounds like a great option for low and npc null. Especially if the fighters drop the moon ore.
---
I saw it in my wallet transaction history. I don't actually remember selling it or even owning it but I'll try and get a screenshot.
---
We're recruiting! :)
---
You're gonna need a massive pile of skill injectors to make that viable.
---
I have a very different definition of 'fun'. 
---
I used to rat and krab in null, but then I got strapped for time so I started station trading (a second attempt) and got into actual spreadsheet simulator.
---
It's really nice (for me) to sit around, build capital using data from research, blocking spammers in Jita local, panic and rage at lowsec smartbombers, shittalk in Jita and perimeter, and calculating profit margins.
---
Considering the direction inflation, botting and injectors is going, this kind of gameplay would become stale in a while.
---
Of course, this isn't really a group activity, but it's nice to see actual gains.
---
You seem to think we're invading legacy, therefore need to have forward stagings in their space. They're invading us.
---
Bot behaviour tends to have bots clump together in one safespot. Scan down these in the whitelisted neutral alt, then have a different, specialised alt, warp to it and kill it. Your whitelisted alt can also optionally anchor a bubble.
---
Hell no, the last thing eve needs is another nullsec blobber promoting more blobbing and cap proliferation.
---
So what was the roll? Not gonna watch a video for this but would be nice to know if you bricked it.
---
You mean the agency while exploring?
---
Local in the agency?
---
Spoiler - it is a god tier DCU now.
---
Some could say that technically RMT is not NCPL. But well, sort is sort.
---
Nothing honorable about those guys. :D
---
Not as good as dumpstering it but good enough I guess. Hopefully he can sell it to some dumb Titan noob and buy himself another AT ship then.
---
I actually tried exploring using the agency, it is pure cancer having to load the agency, click to sigs, then enjoy 90% of the window being used less space.
---
Ccpls just remove signatures from the agency, i gave up on exploration, ahem, scanning after two systems because its so fucking tedious
---
Sounds good to me.
---
https://youtu.be/lp-EO5I60KA
---
Wouldnt suprise me one bit if Gobbins next 200 iq move is shooting NC., would be smarter than earlier decisions.
---
&gt; the jita plan I call it. We abandon our sov, we abandon null, we sit in jita, logged in, all the time. Not actually shooting anybody other than the undock, but filling the system constantly so no commerce can get done
---
  Yes please. Make it happen.
---
Your best bet in a cov ops cloak capable ship is to burn into any direction, hit mwd and cloak and after building up a little speed you change direction of the ship by about 30° to 45°. This way it won´t slow down as much and a possible decloak attempt might go into empty space.
---
Its no 100% guaranteed measure and the more proficient a gate camp is the less likely it is to work.
---
Which is funny because I remember 3 years ago it was the opposite
---
Magni has lotsa mullah probably be using it himself.
---
Look up "cesspool corp/alliance/guild". Thats what this type of corp is - just invite anyone and everyone for... whatever reason.
---
shhh don't wake up SNUFF
---
You died in so many of those tenges even back then when the ship was op as fuck. I’m glad to see not much has changed
---
if bastion make the list why doesn't evan mclean
---
&gt; They then beat it into members that attendance is mandatory, etc. to the point of threatening expulsion for failing to log in and fleet up
---
  I've heard of some corps demanding 50+ kills a month etc. Fuck that, I play the game when I'm free- I don't need to beg permission to take a break from a video game to stay as a member... And to think we all bashed goons years ago for Paplinks.
---
If you are in a citadel and then someone blows it up/it gets unanchored. What happens to your ship? Does it go to asset safety/is thrown into space (in wormholes)? When you log back in, where do you spawn?
---
i wish i had gold for both of you
---
that's tapirium of the galaxy now for you
---
I've heard that docking, leaving ship and reentering ship can sometimes fix that problem.
---
ok
---
When i was new i mined ice , saved up 100mil for astero and watned to try exploration  
---
found my first site in highsec, having 0 clue what am i doing i started recording it for a friend  
---
get alphaed by covert site spawn
---
or not wanting to wait for LS cyno friend for my blops bs, so i gated from jita only to realize i have 5 deccers chasing me
---
podding a sabre pilot in his own bubble is one of the most satisfactory things in eve
---
Yes, they are still in game, got one Tuesday on my 7th site or so.
---
As someone who has occasionally scanned with an un-bonused ship looking for sites using combat probes just sounds painful...
---
He must have had really good scan skills or gotten really lucky...
---
The dude expected to not be attacked in low-sec and was demanding that his ship he replaced because he died
---
wasnt excluding brave and co. for reasons other than simplicity, but you are absolutely right. we are heavily outnumbered.
---
It’s snuff’s cyno alt corp
---
Thats what i did. I died. Hahaha idgaf anymore. Im having a blast on Rust. I do still lurk here once in a while.

As a non-FW player, it always seemed strange to me that player owned citadels are a thing in FW space.
---
What are your thoughts on integrating NPC-owned citadels into the capture and occupancy mechanic?
---
A rough idea: Players can't anchor citadels or any similar structures in FW space (except maybe forward operating bases?), instead the NPC militia does it for them once the system is taken over and properly secured. ACLs would be automatically set to allow based on militia membership (maybe allow neutral players to not fuck with null logistics?). Taking a system would involve killing that structure, maybe with some tweaks like a removed or altered damage cap. Building those bases obviously happens with player input, maybe in form of a new type of FW missions/plexes (gathering or stealing resources, securing/deciding a location, etc.).
---
Also, what are your thoughts on capital warfare in FW space. Yay or nay? Or a yay with asterisk?
---
don't even need to make them happy to get their money too
---
Wait, what that means?
---
I'd come back to eve just to vote for Dunk
---
Amen. 
---
IMHO, the FC interviews and the FC round tables are what made certain Talking in Stations episodes a smash hit.
---
If null sec battles are like watching NBA or NFL play off tournaments, then listening to an experienced FC is a joy for EVE players and akin to hearing sports coaches talk about the deeper aspects of the game.
---
This fit is still garbage.
---
You are the man, lol!
---
nice! ahhaa
---
Except EVE needs a new generation and bittervets cause pretty shit mentalities to the point of where they have a negative impact on the game
---
Can confirm TP gives fun fights
---
Didn't read patch notes, undocked in a Golem to play with a red Nyx on station.  
---
Those new pre-nerf Fighter Bombers reaaaaaaaaaaaaaally hurt
---
Alright so you got rid of every long term player in a game for whom some of the systems are dependent on long term players running it. Now what? Oh oops the game collapses because you need a balance.
---
Heavily gimped jump ranges in Phoebe, and Outer Passage is in the arse end of nowhere
---
Well, he claims to be making 1mil/hr.
---
He was doing relic AND data sites, so an unbonused ship seems about right.
---
Plenty of bittervets will stick with it, it's an obvious shift the game is going through right now
---
Wouldn't that be considered an exploit?
---
HAHA you just made yourself look thick
---
Make sure to do your career agents. There's a lot to do in EVE and all of it will require a time investment. So find what you might want to do and then train towards it. If you end up not liking it, you can always train other stuff.
---
Maybe take away damage cap from neutral citadels in FW space? Or maybe even take away damage cap from anything in low power.
---
At least the next moa death from that Corp is a better fit, so not every member is an idiot
---
They invite people from jita local as well. My market alt has repeatedly been invited to the conoco public channel, even after blocking a few of their main "recruiters"
---
Big plans for not even trying it yet. Let us know after a year or two if you stick around. :)
---
Goons active policy is to use ingame repirting ststem for bots, wtf you on about?
---
My guess is, he wanted to use the expanded probe launcher because it's obviously superior to the Core Probe Launcher, but couldn't get it to fit on a frigate, so he decided to fit it on his Moa.
---
I sure hope it is
---
Iono what bots you've seen, all the ones I've encountered warp to a citadel and dock up.
---
Behold the power of propaganda
---
Woooow! 17.5b? Danmmm!
---
Mine: Scouted a wrong system (station), undocked a ceptor with a set of capital component BPO 10/20 and a few more shit, then i was memed in zkill, biggest loss of the week.
---
A few weeks ago: Came drunk in my home, decided to log in eve (first mistake). Then, decided to see the market. Decided to update my orders. In a single skin, i lost 7b. Missed the updated order by three 0's.
---
Bought 50 enforcers and 50 pacifiers thinking they would be unique. Lost 28b at that time.
---
These were my biggest mistakes (70b lost +-), plenty of very small ones, like warping to gank someone in an alt -9,9 sec satus and with green status (new pc), memed by concord withut doing a single shoot.
---
Jumping into the middle of nowhere with very tight amount of fuel after working the math for a JFC V (the alt had 3) and getting stuck there. NOT A SINGLE TOPE being sold in so many jumps.
---
Well, funny game haha. I love this so much &lt;33
---
Aryth isn't Spy Master, he is economics guy. Stop being dumb.
---
Oh, i thoght those updates happened after Phoebe
---
No moar PL helidickings
---
I would just love to come across a shit fit ship in low sec tbh
---
Yeah he didn't took credit for the whole Judge thing right. Totally did not.
---
Always cute seeing fresh newbros think they can make a corp.
---
Tip.. Dont it turns into a second job. Jist join some small time wh corp and have fun. Dont joon a block unless you enjoy being a faceless mass.

Does this war even deserve a name?

Hope you had time to play during the week, be over by the weekend.

UMMM THE IDEA IS TO KITE RETARD AND NEUT HAS 10KM RANGE

No sorry we need a reason to fight and more isk isnt it..

We need a scarcity system but thats cancer to program so I doubt ccp will do it.

https://zkillboard.com/character/2114238787/
---
Kind of ironic.
---
As an 11 year Eve player not really interested in anything he says, unless it's "I quit".
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
I have seen worse, its not that bad
---
A shift to exiling players who try and stay how is that going to work long term without being able to constantly pull in new players?
---
Then use your neutral whitelisted alt to put down a drag bubble, I guess.
---
Aint worth anything anymore, everyone transitioning to structures. I would hold onto them, either they become collectables, or CCP finally does the buyback for all thePOS stuff like they talked about doing.
---
The shift is that EVE Online is changing for the better, and it might not be for "you" (myself included) anymore. Anybody who cares about the game can recognize that it's trying to move forward with a heavy focus on new players
---
Is it good for a shield cap?

---
Yes, yes they do.  The scamming, constant attacks with overwhelming force even when side cries uncle, ect.  Part of what makes EVE special is the sheer ability to impose your will against another player or group, or to likewise negate a players ability to do so **through player actions**.  Instanced servers impede that by, for lack of a better term, putting you in a different sand box from the other players.
---
Yeah top two meta level Damage control groups have 20-21% shield resistances which is massively more than faction. What mutated was only hull resistances though.
---
You haven't event started playing and you already want to fund a corp? That a lot of confidence in your part. Play the game, have fun, and then after 1 or 2 years think again about funding a corp.
---
Nice
---
Great music too, nice video :P
---
Any idea how much it worth?
---
Taking too long to move to wormholes(basically years after I should have), trying to live in a null block. 
---
Losses wise was way back in the day, on a character that I biomassed on killboards that dont exist anymore(Levvi and Battleclinic). I was flying a ratting apoc from paragon soul, back home to Impass. I didn't have the isk to replace it, yet didn't scout it. 
---
I lost it to a sabre and crusader if I am not mistaken. Was too much of a noob to de-agress and too embarrassed too ask for help on coms. So I died the slowest death I have ever died in eve.
---
Probably because that performance along with the circumstances where indistinguishable from real life customer service.
---
Just goes to show money can't buy skill.
---
This make me want to join Wingspan. My customer service skills are not great but I am decent at delivery.
---
Well I guess it falls inside 5% chance with a 50B roll cost, so it should be very expensive to recreate that is for sure.
---
Abyssals is your best bet for isk in hisec, check them out :)
---
1.	No. As the other comment said it’s actually closer to 2 billion and you’d need a lot more than 1 month of sub to get to a level where it’s reasonable to make that kind of isk. Some people will say it is possible with exploration but realistically it is not possible if you hope to have literally any life besides Eve exploration.
---
2.	Yes large fights still happen and there are still large power blocs with all the politics that come with them. Those battles are not all that common and they are boring as shit to participate in though. 
---
3.	The economy is still excellent compared to any other mmo or any other game really. It’s not as good as it once was but it’s still very very good. 
---
4.	I have no idea what you’re looking for here. 
---
5.	You can join some of the largest corporations and alliances in the game on day 1 if you like.
---
don't worry the second bastion went up you'd get cynoed in so not much difference
---
You are not going to find what you are looking for in nullsec. Wormholes are where this kind of gameplay is at.
---
Yup some of that is small Corp/alliance  posturing to make their killboards look 1337 so they can gain some access or privileges.  Everyone needs the same standards and expectations unless you volunteer on a SIG and then you’re entitled and expected different perks and requirements.
---
All citadels not belonging to the sov holding faction in FW dont get a damage cap? 
---
Or, alternatively, the owning faction of the ihub in system gets damage caps, but sov wont flip until all hostile cits are gone. Include this with the proposed 'frontline' mechanic. Yes, this would lead to a structure grind, however, it could be significantly sped up after the IHUB falls, and any assets in those cits would be asset-safetied to a lock-out station.
---
It had to be a BPC. The Astero never had a BPO. 
---
On the bright side you didn't make a big mistake :)
---
"Sir, you've been in a coma for 7 years"
---
Holy shit you listened to my shit about FW. I really like your suggestion to give the plex rat tackle, too.
---
Anything to stop FW from being what it is now, which is just a bot fest that makes null alliances blush.
---
And still since the spike that alphas brought login numbers are gradually decreasing again. Better my ass.
---
At least it's not kotaku
---
&gt;TIL Hilmar is an idiot.  
---
Better late than never
---
This. It was complete aids. Galmil proper left as well, and rolled into both sides of the test/frat conflict for the most part. It's kinda interesting, because I'm shooting the other half of bebop lately.
---
Keep in mind that ECM was changed a while back so that a jammer can't jam locks against itself, only against other ships. The ship with the jammer can always be targeted by the jammed ship(s).
---
MJD is really your best bet.

I haven't done the fit for an Occator, but maybe it's possible to dual-prop with MJD + MWD. Then fit Engine Thermal Shielding (ETS) rigs. In situation where it's pretty likely that you're going to get scrammed (like landing in a bubble), the ETS rigs will give you a 25%+ longer burn time on your MWD. Since even when scrammed, you still complete the current MWD cycle, that extra boost might be enough to get you out of range of the scram, and out of the bubble as well.

We live in Nenn and see plenty of content.  Of course more USTZ corps and alliances moving to Black Rise would be great.
---
Fat fingered and paid 130b instead of 13b ))))))
---
o7
---
Confirming that in bigger alliances, an interest group of something you've felt some affinity for would be a great place to start. Most experienced players in these groups can advise on other enjoyable things to do or how to do the things you like better.
---
This entirely. Move to a wh if you want small gang stuff
---
Depends if the game survives long enough for them to become a collectors item or not
---
Does Shadow Cartel belong on this list? When i lived in lowsec, they owned all of the POCOs but we rarely saw them about.
---
ok cool ty, they're still spawning at point blanc right?
---
Honestly, right now Eve DOES need to focus on new players. The null blocs are currently handling our NPE and our new player retention is some of the worst in the entire industry, let alone MMOs.
---
They need to make hisec viable for anything anymore, because at the moment big nullsec is safer, more lucrative, more afk, etc. The treadmill players all just coagulate in null blobs and don't do anything. They need to fix FW. They need to make it clearer to players they can survive on their own.
---
They need to give newbies a bit more, to be honest, "handouts". They need to make the newbie feel like he can make enough isk early on to do that whole "lose 50 frigs in facwar and learn to pewpew" thing without feeling like a big idiot for welping "all that money".
---
I joined this Fleet last night and enjoyed the chance to collaborate with random players.  Thanks to FC for stepping in and organising as there was on-going demand in chat for a Fleet throughout the evening.
---
Jumped an orca into a BLACK LEGION  munin fleet back in 2010 thankfully they didn't have anyone on the gare when i jumped so they missed the gate activation. I watched for a really fun 20 seconds begging the ore gods to get them to jump and leave. 
---
They left i warped to a safe and cloaked my orca. I had a nap afterwards.
---
If you look at HighSec/etc there's a lot of new groups and life coming into the game, something we didn't really see in the past
---
You don't need to be a spymaster to say "hey kid, wanna see a dead alliance?"
---
I wondered about this myself.
---
Is there is a nasty exploit: where you can redirect the eve chat server to a random ip using your hosts file. If the chat doesn't connect, would you appear in local?
---
I had a situation like this about a week ago. My ISP was having bad DNS trouble. EVE managed to connect, but every chat channel errored out. I still don't know if I appeared in local or not, and could not test with an alt.
---
The t2 battleships are kind of worthless for solo players so I'd say look at the better cruisers first.
---
So yes citadels are a big killer but in the amarr/min wz the fac war died after min mil took the wz because the reason to fight over a gaining or denying the opponent medals didnt need to exist because the goal had been met. FW needs a goal and back in the day it was something as simple a medal  that kept people playing for 72 hours straight non-stop. Thats what drove the great sieges/fights/fleet action. This drive no longer exists and i want to hear your opinion about how do we bring back that drive? You got my vote either way but your missing something in your setup.
---
The entire point of their organisation is to make the safest region in the game less safe. How is trying to make a difference for the better not an honrable cause?
---
Message \[--SIN\] Blazingbunny for CSM#5132 on discord and I'll get you the link
---
No but jerking off about it makes you
---
Hahahaha this is great
---
Agreed on all counts.
---
I’m not suggesting a marauder for his needs but your statement saying marauders are worthless for solo players is just wrong.
---
yea but i mean it's at least cheaper :)))
---
When they buy back, do they buy the BPCs as well?  Or should I convert them to the module first?
---
FW's fun, but if you want to learn, do it with buddies. Join a newbro friendly FW corp that will teach you the ways of shooting nerds.
---
It could go either way, but there'll be an announcement ahead of time. Wait now, build later if it's the better deal.
---
After twelve years of playing Eve Online you realize that every day is the dumbest thing you have ever done and try not to think about it.
---
I strongly endorse your suggestion of no damage cap.
---
I would couple that with a converse penalty of:
---
1 - No repair cap on citadels within systems owned by their own militia.
---
2 - Tighter repair caps on citadels in systems owned by enemy factions.
---
I'm not saying don't focus on new players. I'm saying balance focusing on new players with not neglecting older players.
---
T3 are more versatile and can handle both, but Marauders would definitely be more effective in missions and useless in explo.
---
This is glorious
---
I really want the Empire Factions in FW to be truly at war. Anything from activity (or lack there of) to timers could lead to an incursion where the FW players have objectives to "win" much like FW sov, and sites/battles to fight that are more rewarding to the lower tier faction in LP and the like to almost encourage stagnation or a back-and-forth.
---
Invasions got Snoked pretty badly.
---
Less than 50 solo kills in your entire lifetime.
---
That's less than one a month.  I feel like I'd have to try to get that few just existing in lowsec.  Non PvPers have more than that when they love in lowsec.
---
Your entire KB is filled with null trash, and not much of it.
---
You don't have the experience in PVP needed to represent lowsec, you aren't even IN lowsec.  
---
Your points are fucking obvious and really nothing new or helpful.
---
It takes you a fucking novel to say what?  3 things?  No one gives a shit; get to the point.
---
SOV null is politics, there is no room for small independent alliances as they'd be taking up valuable renter space for the doughnuts.
---
Wormholes and I guess NPC Nullsec groups are probably more what you are looking for.
---
Makes you what? 
---
Most people try to finish their sentences. I see you are not most people.
---
Not as alphas. And the train into Rorqs is huge.
---
Inspired by the whaling, Gullnars, and chance rivines videos. I have about 35mil SP but have been on off playing for a while. 
---
What is a good way to get into this?
---
Potato mode to start, then add options until you start seeing lag.
---
sold 26 Megathrons for 200 000.99 isk/u instead of 200 000 000.99isk
---
I made someone happy.
---
Fake wormholers, they don't spend the majority of their time dropping heavy armor on ratting gilas.
---
Escort missions, missions where you have to remote rep friendly npcs, missions where you have to hunt (and tackle) an npc, missions with a smaller number of harder enemies, npcs that use drones. So many opportunities. I know it's not a priority but more people in the game is good
---
We wouldn't know, so no plan has been formally announced. *Presumably* they would do both.
---
Taxes scheme?
---
Back in the days thinking that the guy that said he could get me two Fleet Tempest's for 450m each was real and sent the ISK without collateral ;)
---
Yeah, I knew about the quick fixes for it, it just seemed odd that I did everything like I normally did and the rats still went straight to the drones. Didn’t know if the expansion changed some of their AI or not.
---
I came to horizontally agree.
---
haha lol wormholers warp after i cyno in 10 carriers
---
the biggest drawback from faction warfare is that it kills your standing with the enemy factions and if you decide to leave faction warfare your going to be buying a ship in jita or amarr trade hubs, undocking and getting killed by npcs for having bad standings, and its really hard to bring these standings back up
---
I think you should honestly just start hunting and pvp'ing instead of focusing too much on those other things, that'st he best way for you to learn
---
don't jump straight into a blops, you'll only feed. start out flying some basic hunter ships in null like a Stratios (https://zkillboard.com/kill/61768504/ is a generic and useful fit) and simply go for it. frag some VNIs, frag some Ishtars, see how people respond and get used to fighting in general. 
---
then you can branch out into combat probing DED hunters/etc. as you get more experience
---
i mean, i think the guys a tool too, but if you knew more about evan and his ways, i think its more hes got isk/IRL money, and simply does not care what he does, but he does know when people kill big shit it adds enjoyment to others, and doing his part to saving the games content.
---
we as a community have got so min maxed and so perfected at knowing what to and not to do, and what to engage and not to, and care so much, content has been reduced :(
---
Shit, he dropped a whole hour’s worth of ISK!
---
come join the ER room? hmmm
---
I'm not fluent in tilted-ese, but apparently when you do something interesting, you're not supposed to be proud of it.
---
I accidentally redeemed an old PLEX in Kinakka and decided to bring it to Jita with my main in an insta-warping Luxury Yacht. Unfortunately this was while under the influence of Quafe Zero, which meant the yacht didn’t insta-warp anymore. Needless to say, since I had -9.9 sec status at the time, I didn’t make it to Jita.
---
My Amarr pilot wants to have a word with you
---
they just gave over 1m sp
---
No, now everyone thinks eLo is wierd for saying that I wrote elO wrong
---
Decided to fit up a paladin for C4 sites, undocked and with kill right, docked back up. Thinking the kill right had expired now the timer had ran out, undocked again and managed to get 6 jumps with PIRAT on my ass. I managed to tank a fair number of proteus before a nuet ship landed...
---
I’m in agreement with Rinai here. You have successfully identified some of the issues with lowsec and FW but frankly some of the solutions you offer to those issues are shallow and easily worked around and, I think, demonstrate a lack of understanding. Other issues you’ve raised you have offered no real solution to at all. 
---
Drastic change is needed to make a real difference and I think the time for small steps and tweaks is long gone. Yes, drastic change is difficult to achieve, but I live and play in lowsec as do hundreds or thousands of others. We, that is, lowsec and FW, need a CSM candidate who will shout at the top of his lungs in support of this awesome area of space, not beg for scraps.
---
This year, I will be looking at candidates who do not have the tag of a null conglomerate next to their name, because frankly, I feel like more often than not you guys are more part of the problem than the solution when it comes to EVE’s woes. 
---
I appreciate your good intentions though, and wish you the best of luck.
---
that Corp is just the leader nina and like 20 active dudes
---
Expensive? 10000 shuttles * ~16k isk is still a pocket change
---
100mn heavy tengu has about 400 dps less than a cruise golem while costing only ~600m since the only bling you need on it is a A-type small shield booster to run the missions in a decent amount of time.
---
[last week’s thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bs2pgr/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_may_23/)
---
I'm mostly curious as to what a null alliance not aligned to a big bloc would be? You'd assume they'd stay out of as many conflicts as they can to avoid pissing off their neighbors. My assumption is they would be either far away and not worth the effort of fighting or have a little bit of space semi-near a bloc. Neither of those sound like a better option to just being in a blue donut.
---
good to see fundementals still being worked on on its like, 15th year
---
its a horrible mistake. All the rejects end up there.
---
This just shows you have basically learned nothing in 2 years, damn
---
That's why you train into a couple of ship hulls progressively, then the basic skills for the modules you need, and then you improve your support skills order of widest application to narrowest. By the time you're training Cruiser IV you've probably already figured out that you like the weapon system used by that racial cruiser type and that you'd like to use it for PVP or whatever.
---
Yeh its a shame, guess i was being overly optimistic haha
---
Nina is big stronk ruso-german manbear
---
My first thought was black ops, but also to a certain extent what can a solo player need a marauder for that a t2 cruiser can't manage for cheaper?
---
Helped out a rich corpmate with something and was gifted with some blingy gear. Was still fairly green at the time, so decided to slap these mods onto my best ship -- a ratting VNI.
---
Fast forward ~1 month and I was absolutely hammered, ratting, not paying attention to local. Dropped by a small gang. In the haze I realized the value of the ship and proceeded to ask for help from corpmates. Well, I *tried* to ask for help. I was slurring my words and explained myself quite poorly, and just...died.
---
Someone pulled the zkillboard link and I was mercilessly mocked for not paying attention, losing a VNI to a fairly weak gang, *and* for using bling on a goddamned VNI. The afterburner alone was worth more than the hull, I think.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ
---
That fit...
---
I love the “torpedo miles”
---
Yeah for a faster site, use the Caracal
---
Not quite the answer you're looking for but if you're moving large quantities of stuff across hostile space, a JF is something you might want to look into it. I don't use a DST for anything more than a few jumps.
---
If that's all you're doing, you could MJD and have a fast align ship but that will cut down on your cargo capacity. A scout will help you avoid camps, but I would suggest working towards getting a JF since you already would have the second account. You just need the 7b or however much they are now.
---
Did you put an afterburner module on your ship? Afterburners are an active mid slot module.
---
&gt;and the population of this subreddit is definitely more hardcore than the average eve population
---
Don't forget that a big chunk of players take ages to leave their comfort zones.
---
Takes a while to leave high sec.
---
Takes a while to accept that you sometimes lose ships (lose a few ships ratting).
---
Takes a while to feel comfortable losing ships on roams and defense fleets. 
---
Fast forward two years and you have anything between an up and coming FC and a helpless miner in a fancy rorqual whose real purpose is to call for help when pointed by roamers.
---
Nah, CNI has an application bonus, plus two webs with the HAMs and you'll clear the sites faster than an RLML Caracal. It's just a lot cheaper with the Caracal.
---
I made this tristan fit to low apm the some lower tier filaments with 3 toons while only needing to really fly one, but I never got around testing it. It's accessible to alpha clones but it's designed for minimum apm, so not really engaging gameplay if you're only flying one ship (anchor up, assist drones, start reppers, afk). Also, there's a fair chance deviant automata suppressor will be a total PITA with those. Anyway, here's my fit:
---
\[Tristan, abyssal memes def\]
---
200mm Steel Plates II
---
Reactive Armor Hardener
---
Drone Damage Amplifier II
---
1MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner
---
Small Compact Pb-Acid Cap Battery
---
Cap Recharger II
---
Small I-ax Enduring Remote Armor Repairer
---
125mm Gatling AutoCannon II, Barrage S
---
Small Anti-Explosive Pump I
---
Small Capacitor Control Circuit II
---
Small Semiconductor Memory Cell II
---
Hornet II x5
---
Hornet II x3
---
Barrage S x3000
---
Nanite Repair Paste x50
---
It really proves to me CCP are dumb as shit if they never put any effort into this at all. Besides condensing the agent types, removing quality, and adding burner missions they are almost the exact same since 2004.
---
So if you've logged in after a long time of your account being inactive (a few years), some of the old newbie ship fittings have been updated, and the default fit should include a Civilian Afterburner on your corvette.
---
If it's not there, try ejecting from your ship, docking up in a station with your pod( so you get a new one for free) and it should be fitted there.
---
You can follow the same process even if you are super new and for some reason your corvette doesn't have the module fit (corvettes are always free using the above process).
---
On a more general level, you can fit modules to your ship through the Fittings screen, which shows you what fitting room is available for each ship.
---
Hope that helps!
---
So in the tutorial they tell you to use something you don't have and have to equip some how?
---
Paying 43b in brokers fees to sell 4 Concord 25000 plates then cancelling the market order because I forgot to put the decimal point I. The right place and then delisting them
---
Worth trying, absolutely.
---
So much this.  When I lived in wormholes and daytrippers would bitch that I killed them in a relic or gas site, I liked to occasionally remind them of the multiple popups they clicked on warning them that I was waiting...
---
Woo tornados
---
I don't have an insta off the 4-4 undock, but I don't remember the last time I docked up there in anything that didn't instawarp
---
I hope you went: what the hel?!
---
Elaborate.
---
I didn't watch your video.  But I like your look.  The cut of your jib, so to speak.  I imagine you like Brisc Rubal, if Brisc were better in every single way.  If I hadn't won Eve, you'd have my vote.  Good luck to you sir. 7o
---
You are undoubtedly the stupidest person i have seen in any eve video.
---
You mismanage your mods constantly. You are flying a 100mn T3 with split weapon systems (wtf). You do not manage your ranges properly, you are very slow for a 100mn (wtf is that speed).
---
You killed some turbo mouth breathers and made a video. You could have killed every single one of those with a beam fessor.
---
The miasmos is an ore hauler, rather than a miner. You're looking for the Venture, headed to Procurer / Skiff / Rorqual if you want to mine.
---
Also, welcome to eve.
---
Also, shooting stuff is fun.
---
Also, miners generally have the most fun hanging out in comms with fellow miners and doing shit in corps. Nullsec mining is the most lucrative, so I encourage you to hit up Brand Newbros, our newbie organization in Test Alliance Please Ignore! We'd be happy to teach you the ins and outs of nullsec mining. Also teach you to shoot nerds cos this game is dangerous.
---
Blood miner culture needs a kick in the pants.
---
Yeah the caracal does it faster.
---
Groups similar the RnK who would roam null poking at the big boys was the kinda thing i was thinking about. Ik they dissolved due to the current state of the game but that kind of ethos was what i was looking for
---
Okay
---
Actually with the new "board my corvette" button you don't have to dock in a station without a ship anymore.
---
This is the _improved_ tutorial.  Several times over.
---
But yes, that's entirely possible.
---
Aside from everyone flocking to Goons for safety and dank isk, what part of Null is "better" today?  How about Lowsec?  Is FW "better" today?  Wormhole space - how's it doing these days?  Maybe HS is better, but at what cost?
---
A marshal can do blood 10/10 but it’s slower and more expensive than a paladin
---
it also relies on your sec status
---
Hey I did that second one. Basically ninja mined it, got me like 1mil/15 minutes until I could afford the gas mining book
---
eve is not the easiest game
---
Come to lowsec or npc null. Otherwise WHs are the only place you'll find non-aligned groups. Sov null requires allies as no bloc will tolerate a neutral entity holding space in their area.
---
I tried and while you can hold the space you can't do anything with it.
---
that kind of gameplay is long gone for null
---
Will it give you a new corvette if you are already in a corvette though?
---
I'm assuming that will be part of OP's conundrum.
---
Yes, as a oneshot event that some new players got. They need to give new players a legitimately better start, and SP is also not ISK.
---
There need to be more avenues for a newbie to make a billion isk in a week than running sansha relic sites lol. My last mentee got about 5b seed money doing that, got into the market, and is already richer than I am.
---
People trying to make money almost any other way are massively gimped.
---
Some people say nerf sansha relic sites, but the reality is they're NOT that good for anyone but a newbie. I run them in a ceptor sometimes, I pull about 80m/hr while scanning wormholes for roams. I could be carrier ratting or scamming or market trading or solo pvping. Hell I could make more money with some alts or bros suicide ganking.
---
They need to buff isk income from things newbros are pointed to early on, not to the point where they overshadow "endgame", but to the point where they actually give newbros enough isk to feel confident to make their own decisions.
---
Agreed, but honestly a lot of new blood will give veterans what they really want - more small fights. The vast majority of vets bitch about fights being more and more skewed towards f1-fests, and no big conflict drivers.
---
Throw 5k newbros a month into the mix and see what pewpew happens?
---
It should have given you either a civilian afterburner module, or a blueprint to make one. I can't remember the exact details of the tutorial, but check your inventory in your school station.
---
Oh I know I've started and quit a few times because of the learning curve but I'm determined to make it work this time.
---
Oh, good point, I'm not sure about that.
---
This is a character I created in 2009. Ok so I need a new ship and that ship should automatically have afterburners... So I'm not totally crazy :p
---
Battleship cargo should be bigger. Sucks that you have to use a container to squeeze out a bit of extra room.
---
I don't know of many independent sov null groups tbh, but I am in one personally.

We currently hold one system worth of sov in Scalding Pass and are currently fighting our main adversaries Quote Alliance.(http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Quote_Alliance) They hold all the sov around us and are currently being propped up by a large group of better alliances in the area + their main allies(maybe masters? I think Quote rents) in Toilet Paper. (http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Toilet_Paper. - again, be sure to get the . at the end).  
---
We're largely at a standstill TZ war since Quote is unable to fight us 1:1 despite being ~3x our numbers on paper (in reality every single one of us has multiple chars, so our numbers are &lt;15 RL dudes) and us being unable to fight them + TP + whatever other randoms + occasionally frat.

We also do the occasional small gang stuff (vs brave here):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_CmVgrlmyM

We hold no illusions that if someone like Frat decided to seriously evict us it'd happen, but we're enjoying the small-midscale stuff we've been able to do with a bunch of mostly filthy rich/experienced bittervets along with our friends/some new bros recruited from outside the game. :)  
---
So yes, we do exist, just we're apparently not well known (maybe a good thing), and we can barely hold the one system we have considering the blue donut around us. Also not really your typical sov group since we don't make isk in our space, the only ratting we do is to raise ADMs for defensive purposes.
---
Wormholes are great, FW lowsec is dead due to veteran groups choking out content, and nullsec has no limits so will always be subject to human nature.
---
DEQC Is exactly that, small but very active Corp/alliance in Nullsec, we own a few little systems no safe umbrella but ton of content.
---
yes you can have someone else courier it but the original player needs to be in system to finish the mission.
---
Sounds like more dedication is needed!
---
I would assume it was a bpc, in wich case it would have to be sold through contracts. That history should still be there.

They are EVE's premier PvP Guild

My suggestion would be to join the Corp “eve university” for a little while to accelerate your learning. Don’t think of it as something you’ll do forever, or even more than a short period of time, but it will help you get acquainted with all the retarded nuances that can be daunting for a new player on their own.

What if I told you CCP in the current year are utter dogshit compared to what they were?

Plus, any new loot is artificially higher "value" for the early takers.
---
I sense a market opportunity for mercenaries. They can now be given a clear objective, make reasonable guesses on resources needed to do the objective and the client clearly knows if they did their job!

Was looking for a marauder (vargur to be accurate).

Why is it worthless for solo?
---
Hope you're well, Dark.  Thanks for sharing this.  Zeratul continues to be a capable leader and Sahara is off providing legal services in Null.  Fly safe o7
---
What an amazing example of emergent gameplay and also an amazing example of shit game mechanics. So confuse. is ccp bad or ccp good?
---
Stop being a soft hearted plebian. If you want the kills you need to commit to waking your household up at 4:10 AM with drunken rage screaming.
---
thanks! I was not sure if they even allow that.  That must be a loop hole
---
Okay, the pineapple pizza. Whatever.
---
But is a hot dog a sandwich? Critical information for your campaign.
---
I mean, the bastion module always sounded like a cheap siege module to me so I don't see why something like that would be needed outside of structure bashing?
---
I'm not totally against alarm clocking, done it a fair few times under the old stront system. But that had a lot more randomness to it and you could game it a bit to make it more reasonable. I can't do that to a Citadel.
---
Best I can hope for is to get one of the timers on a weekend but that still means I have to lose sleep on a work night.
---
Bring back stront timers.
---
Call it a wash?
---
It's easy to complain about "timezone tanking", but it's a fact that timezones exist and with an international server the game has to be designed around them.
---
Sure it'd be great if you're in the US and you could force timers to come out at like 9PM your time. But if you're fighting like a Russian corp, you're just forcing *them* to wake up at 4AM to defend instead.
---
It makes more sense to let the defenders decide the time a structure comes out than to let the attackers do it imo.
---
What brought you guys back?

&gt; camping them doesn't kill them though?

Camping them fucks up their income, congrats you're better off than they are

&gt;if you think good gameplay is being able to avoid all pvp interaction if you want, that's not how eve online is supposed to work
---
Removing local wouldn't stop people from simply not playing the game if anyone comes through. Any retard can look at the way the game works and see that any group worth hunting will just put cloaky eyes on gates and then we'll have "elite" PVPers who bitch about how they can't get infinite fights against their very specific set of targets complaining about how people are allowed to watch twitch streams and play EVE. Removing local won't fix shit, with it there you can at least fuck up a krab's day, if you really need more fights try taking a minute to realise you'd find a lot more if you were willing to shoot something that isn't a shitfit VNI for once.

Horde. They are significantly smaller, and goons have way more capitals and mining production going on. Funny thing is though, the north is currently having open season in delve (goons’ mining area) because all the delve Capital ships are out fighting.

She just needs to adapt. It's not the attacker's reponsibility to feed her content.
---
I woke up with a hangover and 2 billion Isk gone from my wallet. I checked my transactions to see what happened.....
---
Turned out while I was drunk I spent 2 bill on a mining ship + drones. After 5 minutes decided mining wasn't for me and sold the lot for practically nothing.
---
On it. Thanks for the info!
---
The system needs some give and take to be honest. Putting totally in favor of one side or the other stifles content either way.
---
I'll take a look at it. I know to get anywhere you have to join a corp, I'm usually more of a solo player because of trust issues in MMOs. Guess I need to get over that though for Eve lol.
---
There’s always the weekend?
---
REMOVE TIMEZONES
---
I mean that's basically the temporary version of what we've been doing bluing all these non-USTZ guys.
---
Marauders are the one of the best lvl 4 runners, and while Marauders can tank a lot, fielding one costs more than a dread and it'll get caps dropped on you hard. Maybe useful for high sec structure bash, but for their cost they're well outclassed by dreads
---
.... I need a lot of mirrors in space.
---
Or an extra Sun
---
- an afterburner is a module that you fit to a ship
---
- once fit to the ship, it is now available on the HUD
---
- once in space, simply clicking on the module in the HUD will activate the module
---
I don’t know what the training for it is, but you will be able to use it as you would any other module that requires activation.
---
You should be able to tie a key to it in the settings.
---
Pos will also defend itself even if you don't wake up.
---
If the attacker can influence the day of the timers then you can get a weekend timer which expands your reasonable window of opportunity from like ~6hrs to ~16hrs.
---
Wormholes are more of a niche than ever, lowsec is dead mainly because of citadels and null is in a terrible state thanks to a lot of "awesome " changes like citadels, rorquals and injectors.
---
Ccplz develop the game around MY time schedule these other players around the world don't matter.
---
So, how did that make you feel?
---
Instead of 15min of exactly when defender sets it it should be a random 3 hour window + - 90min from when defender set it. Would go a long way towards fixing the issue.
---
It's a Russian FW corp with extremely aggressive recruiting. They are the reason most Russian newbros quit the game. Also they have 1 capital ship or some such.
---
Totally an option. But it's a little weird giving AUS players so much content when they're the lowest activity timezone, not that I don't want them to have some of course.
---
But I'd also really love the option to actually fight for myself.
---
I can guarantee you the people who have war dec'd us arent shooting us only during AUS prime.
---
Lol I spend my time exclusively in wormholes and lowsec and can safely say you have no idea what you're talking about
---
You can repackage your corvette and when you re-assemble it will have the default mods on it
---
Glad to help. This game's new player experience frankly SUCKS, and the community is your real source of help. There are a lot of newbie nullsec corporations out there that'll help, but honestly they're very focused on alliance objectives. They want people who are effective in big fleets and who can make isk for themselves. These are good things, but they're far from everything in eve.
---
I believe in teaching people to fly their own ship, know what a small gang does, know how to find their own content. Whether that's solo pvp in small shit, big shit, small gangs, big gangs, hunting, ganking, harassing, dictor trolling, blood mining, bait mining, bait ratting, or just drunk roaming.
---
Stick with it, learn the game a bit, and if you decide you do want a bit more handholding with a newbro corp, hit me up and get into Brand Newbros, my last mentee just graduated.
---
I agree with that, I guess. The defender chosing the day of the week is not a good system.
---
It should be a fixed number of days instead imo. 3, 5 or even 7, doesn't really matter how many exactly as long as the attackers can use it to decide the day.
---
They are degenerates, gun them down on sight like the rats they are.
---
mods i want my fucking peace windmills back
---
POS reinforcement mechanics were better, and I didn't see anyone bitching about how it was so unfair to their timezone.
---
Can someone translate this to human language?
---
Conoco are literal shit and most of the people there log in about as often as your average r/eve poster
---
And for this alone, you will have my voice. 
---
That is if i ever find out how to vote. :D
---
Apparentl the Brisc situation is "ongoing".. 
---
"HV: I think no comment for now. It’s kind of an ongoing thing, so, no comments at this time."
---
So i guess maybe hes not innocent after all?
---
Oh, okay, they changed the NPE since I last did it. Sorry my advice was inaccurate!
---
I’ve never mutated anything.  Green is good, sure, but video resolution on my phone sucks, what happened?
---
&gt; This is a darwinist corp that believes in letting EVE break the weak
---
Then why the fuck have they not committed mass suicide
---
"I spoke with Hilmar at Reboot Develop Blue 2019, in Dubrovnik, Croatia. EVE Online is a big game which just got a new expansion (Invasion) and it looks poised to grow even bigger thanks to the relentless efforts of CCP Games. "
---
This is comedy gold.
---
After reading that, first thing I did was look up the date the article was released.
---
&gt; basic solo ships...like a Stratios
---
The stratios is not a basic ship. OP should start off with a t1 frig/destroyer/cruiser (whatever they prefer) and work their way up from there
---
Is there a zkill filter for ships killed by the invasion rats?
---
Solo players have a place in eve, a lot more of one than most people in nullsec believe. There are corps that mostly cater to solo and small gang pvp, there's a lot of room for solo nomadic PvE, etc.
---
You don't \*have\* to join a corp, but there are good ones that'll help you out if you want to make some friends.
---
Regarding trust issues: you're a newbro, you have nothing worth stealing/awoxing/fucking over anyway. :)
---
Boohoo? People play in different time zones around the world?  (though I do think some iteration on it would be nice with some more influence by an attacker?)
---

Looking forward to shooting you soon.
---
Was it Bastion and/or Forged of Fire was literally made as a pet alliance for all the dead cfc allies that were too useless to widot in Goonswarm?
---
Damn, now i will have to vote for the StainGuy. :D
---
I am structure neutral, ingredient purist - https://i.imgur.com/wRDKtp7.jpg
---
Also how scary are war deccers that live in another TZ than you do? And if they really just put it into that TZ to tank their structures one or two guys can akf end that war
---
I really appreciate the fit and dscan link. 
---
I see it has the core launcher instead of c
---
Extended for combat probes. Is that something I should care about?
---
At least he undock... Why the hate? How someone is going to get better without making mistake and if he has fun what is it with you?
---
The thing is, "null life" is more than paps and treating every fleet like a CTA. It's treating null like FW and roaming small as often as you can. Get out for fun.
---
I know there's some of you guys doing that because one of your boys just got his 200th solo kill when one of my small gangs flushed a ceptor into him. Yes, this happened in nullsec. :)
---
I'm not familiar with marauder, but just the bonus itself was looking good.
---
This is why I don't record myself playing EVE, you'll never see me being this stupid in EVE.
---
You didnt actually...?
---
So this wouldn't fix tz tanking outside of highsec, but what if they made it so that the aggressor in the war's timers got moved to the defending alliance's timer. The aggressor still has the choice to not declare the war if they really dont want to have to fight in that TZ and allows the defender to actually do something in the war. I could see this being complicated with multiple wars and maybe CCP could code it so the timer was determined by the alliance that got the last hit to RF it.
---
sure, if they have zero pvp experience at all, they should - I'm guessing they have some experience and want to get into 0.0 hunting (which is what gulnar does), which you don't really do in the ships you listed
---
if /u/SmallBuzPriv has no pvp experience/is generally poor ingame then they should reconsider getting into this
---
They can go kill them nasty jackdaw and venture botters.
---
I should go invest in smartbombs.
---
Seem to be in still, got one yesterday, spawned at 0 on them.
---
Thank you, good sir. 
---
But i still have no idea what is this post about. :DDD
---
Hmmm. At the time a bit shocked and annoyed at myself and then CCP for having the two selections so close together(stages of grief).  Since learned you can safe log off through settings menu. Doh.
---
My CEO of my Corp give me a replacement Hull so that eased my pain.
---
The beauty of playing with incoherent russians &lt;3
---
He's the guy putting shit IN the koolaid.
---
Posting here.
---
PS: you win.
---
Skilled pilots? Not really..
---
the core launcher is offline, it's there in case you need to probe a site/WH/whatever as a backup - it does not have a combat prober, it's only for hunting people who run anomalies (vnis/ishtars/some battleships/etc.)
---
if you want to solo hunt + have combat probes, t3's are your best bet. the cloaky arty loki is very good for that, but much more expensive. I am trying to get you started out cheaper to get into this lifestyle, the videos you were watching has people flying 1-10b+++ worth of ships
---
Ahhh....
---
Then no, thank you, i played DOTA 2 with them, i got enough to last me 4-5 lifetimes. :D
---
Thanks, I have limited PvP experience till this past month hence the low sec hunting.
---
I can definitely sit in the ship linked above and have most if not all truly core skills maxed
---
Edit: I think a component of my issue is I can fly things with at least mediocre skills but don't know the fits at all because of my on/off playing
---
Though I'd really like to know what they were meaning... Like google translate does _something,_ but it doesn't exactly help me understand the conversation
---
Oh hi.
---
Wow, you need a TL;DR.  Let me help you:
---
1. Problem: Little rewards for flipping FW systems. Proposed solution: If you are in FW and you don't own a system, you can't dock in citadels.
---
2. Problem: Income generation for FW on the corporate level.  Proposed solution: some kind of structure that mines stuff for you.
---
Other stuff:
---
I had fun in FW before.
---
I enjoy content from small gangs of trash ships and the eventual micro escalation steps.
---
New dudes can have fun in FW.
---
&gt; Is a bubble + scrams always going to be the end of an occator? 
---
That combo is the end of any ship. :)
---
This one?
---
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7016936/mediaviewer/rm1476547840
---
Generally they're in the same timezone as you, shooting you while you're active.
---
But their structures are not.
---
Waking up at 4 am two nights a week to bash a structure with no defenders is miserable game play.
---
Dank leeks went mad bro.
---
I fuckin knew AIDER was leaving before AIDER sent anything.
---
Can you show the fit?
---
Their chatter makes perfect sense. It's just google translate being dumb.
---
There is even an ancient anecdote on the subject:
---
— How much watches?
---
— Ten clocks.
---
— Such much?
---
— For whom how…
---
— MGIMO finished?
---
— A-a-a-ask!..
---
You forgot Nina's 18,000,000,000,000,000,000 alts.
---

---
Nah gotta get a prospect much better
---

---
[https://i.imgur.com/blfqP6c.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/blfqP6c.jpg)
---
I mean it's obvious that they understand each other\^\^ Though considering my inability to speak russian, and me not knowing about any good translation tools for russian makes all russians seem a bit incoherent to me
---
&gt;  And if they really just put it into that TZ to tank their structures one or two guys can akf end that war
---
You don't think citadels had anything to do with choking out FW space?  It was just the veteran groups?  
---
And you really think wormhole space is in a good place right now?  Like, you really believe that?  How long have you been in J space anyways?
---
That sounds horrible and sounds like they're failscading.
---
I dont know how your killboard looks, but its probably a good idea to roam null in some cheap solo frigs first to get a feel for things, but you dont have to listen to me ;p 
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/95574399/group/25/losses/ this ~~wanker~~ guy has a lot of losses you can be inspired by for solo null stuff in frigs (or fly the OP jaguar, https://zkillboard.com/kill/75969702/ - it can kill vnis/ishtars/etc. too)
---
Yep, DEQC recently left brave looking for exactly the content you describe. We have joined the united federation of conifers in Pure Blind. And I must say we are having a hell of a good time.
---
You...
---
I like you
---
Having ran a FW corporation, having Hels sit 200km off novice complexes and 6 Nyxes dropped on small cruiser gangs are what killed that region. 
---
We left NS for WHs a few months ago and are having a fuckin' blast, so if you're not having fun then you need to make a change.
---
What was the last conflict worth noting involving wormholes? (Aside from 1500 goons killing that hk keep with next to no no resistance). Where are all the lowsec groups? Ill tell you, dead or in null.  
---
And i think about null i don't need to lose more words.
---
The blue donut is NOTa necessity.    I'll always put my group first but there are many different independent sov null groups that roll with the punches, hit back hard, and are worth their salt.  
---
We live in Pure Blind.   (here come the downvotes) . We pvp, industry, kinda everything.    We roll with the punches, fight to our best ability when we can, and we have fun doing it.   I've met some great dudes that I now call friends.   
---
Do you want an alliance/group that is paving their own path?  This is it in my opinion.  We do what we want, when we want.   We get pushed around?  So fucking what!  We roll with it.

That fit, that poor Moa got so brutally done in with that fit... One of the worst i ever saw for sure. Still cant believe it...
---
Well, I didn't think of dread for a second, in my past memories, it was a kind of 'end game content' so I don't know a damn things about these ships. I think I have some homework to do.
---
I'm about to solo a C3. I have 1 alt that can fly Tengu and 1 alt than can fly Loki.
---
I have never, never ever doing anom in WH before, but I know they have triggers. I just need fits.
---
Lol that's the spodbrain talking, you don't need huge conflicts to have fun. That's why people go to nullsec. Daily fights and small gangs are a blast.
---
Nice that's good to know, thanks for that info.
---
For 10 years the game worked fine. Then they ruined it with citadel and rorqs. Dunno what to tell you
---
Thrash that should be penalized for shitting on newbros trying to figure out the game.
---
It's a gas station.
---
An AU group using AU timers is perfectly fine. What sucks is people around the world using AU timers because they are way harder to attack consistently for the vast majority of possible hostiles.
---
That just isn't balanced correctly.
---
While thats good, the biggest problem with Eve is the mobility of caps/supers/cyno in general.
---
Every battle is a matter of showing how much surprise buttsex you can cyno in.
---
Not really, like swapping corps is something a lot of players do, yes that might ask you why did you leave your current corp, I wasn't having fun is a perfectly acceptable answer. 
---
like if you swap once a week sure people will go meh but like having multiple corps on your history is hardly a big deal.
---
Yeah thought it may be something like that! Some of my alts are from c.2010/2011 and they had that issue too :)
---
Public holiday for Triglavians. Labor laws make it too expensive for Trig military leadership to let the ship crews work overtime.
---
A few small groups having fun there doesn't make them not a niche. Quite the opposite in fact, that's the very sign they are one.
---
This would be a nice solution to allowing alliances who want to defend against an aggressive war a more reasonable way to do so. I like it.
---
You're right it would get complicated with more wars.
---
Lol, Rose tinted glasses much.
---
They were so bugged to shit it was a 50/50 toss up if they actually defended it
---
Meanwhile I'm pinging small gang 3-4 times a week and having fun.
---
DREDDIT IS RECRUITING.
---
Who in leadershit is yelling at you? Sounds like people have overextended themselves in management.
---
I wonder if the Triglavian's have a 3 day long weekend?
---
Casey's too busy doing shit in space.
---
&gt; Is there is a nasty exploit: where you can redirect the eve chat server to a random ip using your hosts file.
---
You can do this with any website or service that uses domain names. The trick to the exploit would be getting access to the remote users host file. But at that point it's probably better to just use proxy if you have local access to redirect as some things do ignore the host file.
---
Citadel mechanics are garbage I absolutely hate the things... I spent a week with barely an hour a sleep a day shooting crap that came out between 8pm and 5 am. I'd love to go back to pos mechanics but they're going away and I have no faith in ccp being able to reacheive that sort of content :'(
---
It was definitely a market sale and not a contact sale. I can only assume that because there were several years in between selling it and playing again that the server mistakenly marked it as a BPO.
---
Or his Bastard Son?
---
attacker sets own vulnerability timer.  
---
attackers structure gets additional timer to match defender.  
---
if attacker want multiple wars they potentially have multiple vulnerabilities a day.  
---
smart attacker can pick wars that all coincide with their own natural TZ.
---
Technically yes, but I think the last few months have made the effectiveness of timezone tanking pretty obvious.
---
It utterly stifles what could be good content and groups get worn out and don't bother.
---
For the thousands of undefeded AUS timed astrahuses you'd think more would be dying if it were as simple as you say.
---
yall some haters, this is an awesome vid bro post more
---
I figured they were using the new map and got lost, gave up, and went home.
---
just standard mechanics. as long as item exists as an item, you can trade, contract, lose, gamble or do whatever you want with it. 
---
heck you can probably buy a replacement for exorbitant prices.
---
CCPLZ eliminate timers in AUTZ completely. (blacklist that timezone for structures)
---
https://zkillboard.com/group/1982/highsec/ should have most of them
---
top kills will only show people who other people shot because the npc-only kills are filtered out by zkill - so if you want higher value kills, use /iskValue/:

---
That's not what I'm saying at all but okay.
---
No matter what time it is set for, it will be 4 am for someone.
---
Defenders picking the time is fine. Picking the day is not.
---
If the attackers could pick the day then they can either stay up late or get up early to fight the defenders in their tz. That's a fair compromise, 4am Wednesday timers are not.
---
I mean, to some extent it's a "famous" corp. 
---
I have never heard this name before i saw this post, and it surprised me that so many ppl here actually know this corp lol.
---
he closed his corp since then xD
---
need more salty boi's
---
No fucks given for w space
---
There's a name I haven't seen in a long time.  Probably the best PvP outfit I ever came up against back in the day in small to medium sized engagements.  That was many moons ago, though.
---
Run gammas in a Gila man quick and easy money
---
I know its not.  
---
its what im saying. Its actually quite funny. Especially for its impact to those dirty convicts living in the basement of the world. &lt;3
---
Thank you for all the responses guys. Will have to get to testing these fits and see how we get on!
---
There are plenty of large groups, but wormholes don't reward blops for daily content. Wormholes limit the amount of players you can fit through for immediate content, so huge groups only benefit for big ops and evictions. 
---
Plenty of content, just dunked this while typing:  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76998206/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76998206/)

Shadow has faded away over the last 2 or so years.  They still exist in some form but are a shadow of their former selves. 
---
 They were hit hard by the essential death of lowsec powers in the wake of the  Phoebe and Lifeblood patches.
---
lol, that was never gonna be a thing come on man
---
Resource wars
---
Goons pinged fleet and the Triglavians dropped the invasion to get in fleet! PAP.
---
It's like you're retarded....
---
Once more, with feeling:
---
- One less timer across the board; 2 for full power, 1 for low 
---
- Defender only chooses tz
---
- Higher damage cap so refs only take 15m
---
- Timer spans are 2, 3, and 5 days for M, L, and XL structures respectively
---
- Citadel defences only online during 2nd repair cycle
---
Reduced grind, reduced tz tank, reduced lameness of going to other people's space, all without changing anything fundamental or redoing the mechanics.
---
pretty sure ccp did this so that the high seccers see what we have to deal with in null
---
I just wanted to be able to unlock everything of the game with a few of my buddies without having someone else in control, etc. Would it be wiser just to hold off?
---
Hot damn if you're aren't as dumb as a wormholer trying to claim they're the ELITE
---
&gt; I'm not going to get into the parallels between this war (whatever it's being called this time) and World War Bee (we won we got to pick the name - besides Casino War is a trash name
---
WWB was actually a lot more even numerically despite goons protests at the time that the blob was unfightable.  TEST being on the opposite side was a big part, and the CFC was bigger than the modern Imperium.  Granted, it was PvP-leaning alliances on one side and krab-leaning alliances on the other, but it wasn't nearly the numerical wipeout this war is.
---
Aryth is Goonswarm's economic director. He works hard for the CSM and takes it very seriously. since you're not a goon. Interaction with you is irrelevant. Since you are irrelevant. 
---
Vote for him if you want a quality CSM representative. Or don't vote for him if you're retarded.
---
Didn't it end up being The Expanse or something?
---
StainGuy alt account?
---
In that case my recommendation would be to start a lowsec small gang corp. Hunt clone soldiers/mordus rats for income or daytrip into the C2/low wormhole superhighway. Huffing gas and running C2 sites is good income as well.
---
Use the C2 superhighway to find shit to fight. Base in active lowsec near facwar for reliable access to fights or buttfuck nowhere and never get harassed. When you're used to the game consider moving into wormhole space.
---
Here's my idea.  Timers are now auto-set based on the time your alliance is most active.  Once per hour, CCP does an auto check of how many dudes are online in your alliance.  The biggest number on average is the time that your structure timer will focus.
---
This sytem is not PERFECT, but it feels like it can't be far off either from auto-setting a timer that's your strongest TZ, and not just setting an arbitrary timer that's bad for your advesaries.
---
Nah. We literally just killed it too fast.
---
That’s the spirit!
---
I get a four day workweek vibe from them, lest the guillotines come out
---
man if I go with this...
---
Yeah that'd be pretty awesome.
---
No, Even in 2014-2016 when I was actively using them, It was a toss up if mine would ever actively defend itself And on some rare occasions it would even decide to shoot me.
---
Lol, I never had that happen.
---
How much harder are T4 abyssals than T3s? I can tank T3s just fine but usually finish with 8 or 9 minutes left on the clock. Would I need to bump up my DPS to be safe?
---
Give this man a medal.
---
Perhaps the first incursions will only be stage 1, and stage 2 will roll out in the following cycles, to stagger the content release?
---
Plenty of large groups is either an extreme exaggeration or you have an interesting definition of large. Either way i do know how wormholes work, lived in one myself for a short time. I never said you can't have fun there but the number of wormhole inhabitants is still extremely low compared to the playerbase and its quite a different way of living too. A niche.  
---
What that kill is supposed to prove is entirely beyond me though. Do you expect people to believe incursion runners get lost in wormholes all day long? If you want to attract people you should use a report from a proper fight, i'm sure that would convince people more. And maybe even more if it doesn't involve a cancer fax.
---
i’m wanting to get back into the game, but don’t want to pay for a sub again just yet. do corps have any use for someone like me?
---
Sure.

marauders have high dps, high tank, crap mobility.
---
t3c have moderate dps, high tank, moderate to high mobility. 
---
for marauders you want golem(if you can use t2 cruise launchers) or vargur(if you can use t2 autocannons) or paladin if you do missions for amarr
---
for t3c you want tengu with either heavy missile launcher or heavy assault missile launcher 
---
youll need t2 guns/launchers for max juice :)
---
fyi: t3s also gives you the ability to fit covops clock and be immune to bubbles with subsystem refit so you can go around 0.0 but covops frigs do relatively good job at exploring too so...
---
Then I would say that you sould provide them with beneficial constructive criticism  or stop playing the game. You dont seem to enjoy it too much.
---
Maybe I just haven't reached the next level IQ of 400 where I pay some brainlet to move my ship 1J out of Jita.
---
The point is that AUTZ timers are deliberately set because it's inconvenient bordering on life altering for the vast majority.
---
Congratulations! You've just denied the vast majority of your players the ability to play as intended because you can't count!

I feel you need some help,

---
&gt; I’d like to see some kind of module with reduced yield but automatic mining in a lowsec exclusive module
---
My thought on this was to very specifically tie it to FW by allowing corps/alliances engaged in FW to recruit diamond-rat NPC miners from their faction to mine their moons for them (at reduced yields ofc), with a total cap on mining amount that's set by the overall FW activity of the corp as measured by (e.g.) LP earned/opposing ships killed/something like that.
---
Example mechanics:
---
FW corp AmarrFTW is enrolled in (unsurprisingly) amarr FW, and has recently captured a moon and set up an athanor in an attempt to get some corp-level SRP income. In addition to fitting it with a drill, they also give it a 'standup mining coordinator' service module. This module can only be onlined on a refinery in lowsec whose owners are in the same militia that controls the system, and when active automatically spawns amarr-faction NPC miners when a chunk explodes. These miners automatically mine out the rocks over the next couple hours and return them to the refinery, at a significantly-less-than-100% yield for balance (exact amount TBD).
---
The total amount of ore that can be mined in a given period on behalf of the corporation/alliance, across all refineries, is set by the FW activity of the corp. In the last (e.g.) month AmarrFTW earned X LP and destroyed Y opposing militia ships, which the amarr empire decrees is enough to earn enough mining vessel support to mine Z units of ore, which is oh-so-coincidentally equal to the moon chunk output over time of one athanor. Next month AmarrFTW has recruited more pilots and earned 2X LP and destroyed 2Y opposing ships, earning them enough support to fully utilize two athanors. AmarrFTW therefore decides they're going to try to take and defend a second moon.
---
The idea here is that this specifically incentivizes FW participation by giving FW corps/alliances the unique ability to mine moons passively. Tying it to FW activity not only encourages people to get out there and fight, but also discourages absentee landlords from hoovering up all the moons since they couldn't actually *use* them unless they participate in FW. It also organically ties possible moon income level to the size and activity level of the owning corp/alliance. This particular set of mechanics also offers counterplay in that opposing faction pilots can try to attack the NPC miners to disrupt their opponents' income (there would be some minimal NPC escorts, enough to scare off a frigate or two, but not much more than that), or can simply try to capture the system to shut off the service module, even if they don't want to (or can't) deal with the citadel destruction mechanics to remove the refinery itself. (Both of those counterplay mechanisms can also serve as fight generators, since the owners know when their moon chunks will explode and system captures can always be contested.)
---
There's literally one Eve PvE activity that isn't in some way solo content, and that's incursions.
---
This is a Triglavian ***incursion***.
---
It's not meant to be solo content. If you want solo content, you can have abyssal deadspace, missions, combat sites and whatever else the game throws at you.
---
In general plans like this rarely come to anything concrete like a finished show.
---
If I recall Halo was supposed to have a TV show/movie a dozen times already but each time, it fell trough.
---
Dude you need to do the [career agent](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Career_Agents) missions. The tutorial should have pointed you where to go.
---
Are you still in the system you were born in? The school with the career agents should be within a few jumps.
---
Oh, and bookmark https://wiki.eveuniversity.org.
---
Oh that reminds me i'll even help you unironically with a great argument:  
---
Move to wormholes guys, br.inyour.space has no issues displaying the fights in wormhole space because they usually involve less than 100 kills.  
---
For null fights you will have to use fleetcom.
---
I can totally see people leaving a bunch of alts logged in over night to skew this intentionally, then logging them off during prime time.
---
Needs a more complex activity metric.
---
Then you'd also have the issue of holding corps doing the same. Wouldn't be an option for war HQs but would happen everywhere else.
---
It's not *quite* a "cheap siege module"; it doesn't increase the Marauder's damage at all, but it increases its weapons range, massively boosts its tank, and makes it immune to all E-War other than Neutralizers. However, much like with a Siege Module, the intent is that the Marauder lands on grid, hits Bastion, and becomes a fixture of the battlefield, laying down fire and facetanking anything that comes at it. (Also it only has a 1-minute cycle time, so Marauders can alternate between Bastion and MJD to reposition their stationary turret form.)
---
While the Siege Module is an offense tool, the Bastion Module is purely defensive.
---
Man I’ve heard Goons called botters but calling them actual NPCs is p wild :P
---
Yes I too like F1 monkey fights that are pure intel games with no skill
---
No. 50/40/5/5. 50% it defends itself. 40% it doesn't shoot. 5% it goes rouge and shoots you. 5% it has wnadered off and the stick is 1kkm away from the modules.
---
depents, half of my mates use moa or thorax, makes me feel bad for using a venture for gas
---
Or they still think about how to adress issues like this in the future, which is the more likely scenario.
---
Vk Nolen&gt; ooh, the Chinese are so fucking annoying (\*don't know how to translate it closer to the original)
---
Raptor Darine&gt; did you fucked him up?
---
Vk Nolen&gt; no lufax have more speed
---
Vk Nolen&gt; I only killed his drones
---
Raptor Darine&gt; that's sad (((
---
Vk Nolen&gt; it's ok) the only guys that come out on honest pvp currently are "perfects" (\*probably some corp name)

Vk Nolen&gt; Lucy Mandler I wanted this fool

Thanks for the more comprehensive translation!

Though I am curious how he killed the drones of my Kestrel
---
Iirc CCP once told a story of accidentally giving the POS's Drifter behavior. Whole death star POS would warp to gate and blap you.
---
Agreed. #bbst
---
Marauders are in a bit of a bad spot. They're extremely expensive for what they are, and while they're very durable (active tank with Bastion), they're also very obvious targets for hostile gankers, and if you run out of cap you die instantly. Also, being battleships, there's the issues of alignment, warp speed, and application to anything small. Add to that the unfortunate reality that the Marauders' role bonus to Tractor Beams isn't at all useful because we have Mobile Tractor Units now.
---
Tech 3 Cruisers, meanwhile, are... basically the best subcapital ships in the entire game. Because they can choose to do *anything*, and they can do it better than almost any other subcapitals. Battlecruiser, or even Battleship-grade DPS, with better-than-Cruiser application; battlecruiser or even battleship-grade tank, or CovOps-grade scanning and hacking (while still having the battlecruiser DPS); high warp speed and interdiction nullification; with the right subsystems, Strategic Cruisers literally do it all. And you can refit and re-rig them at will as your taste in "What do I want to do today?" changes.
---
^(The above commentary is absolutely in no way influenced by my own recent acquisition of a Loki, and its immediate adoption as my scanner, hacker, site runner, fleet DPS, armor logi, shield logi, and blockade running ship.)
---
&gt;beneficial constructive criticism
---
Yeah they have a history of listening to that to prevent themselves from rushing into something and fucking it up.
---
Pretty sure CCP doesn't give a crap about how HS feels about it or how null feels about its' "struggles" with mechanics. It's just another half thought out mechanic to throw onto the pile of broken/incomplete features one can find in HS, LS and FW. Sounds bitter, but tell me how it isn't a real problem in EVE?
---
You need to buy more PLEX to invade
---
A pair of worms works pretty well if you dont mind paying for them.
---
Just FYI : https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/buduhn/sansha_nation_wish_to_communicate_that_fleets/             
---
/u/CCP_Falcon maybe it is time to do some game news about this glorious Sansha operation
---
lol, I don't even know what to say...
---
See, that's the kind of attitude that doesn't convince people. If you turn this into a wormhole life sale thing halfway through then you need to see it through. Talking down to people and belittling how they play their game won't convince them your playstyle is the better one. They will just think you and as a result your people are self important assholes.
---
The russians have very specific slang, which came from the time the russian game client was shit and basically everyone was advised to play using the english one. The slang was formed mainly by the "everu" forum community. You can see it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/beog4u/slang\_used\_by\_russian\_eve\_players/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/beog4u/slang_used_by_russian_eve_players/)
---
If you're in a region with NPC null, then angering the neighbors isn't necessarily as big of a risk.  Sure, the big blocs can form up and go after our sov and we'll try to put up a good fight.  But at the end of the day you're still able to base out of the NPC stations.  Unless they have someone to take over living in the area you had previously you can start poking the sov and force them into entosis fighting repeatedly all while going about the same antics as before. It's a fun style of play and a great way to find all different types of content.
---
Lol I'm not in this comment chain to convice people, just responding to some guy. 
---
If you want convincing check out my other threads
---
https://kryptedgaming.com/eve-online-wormholes/why-wormholes/
---
But in this case the “defender” is actually the aggressor.  Does that make it any different?
---
It's coming out right after Logi killmarks and Angel titans
---
Based on the behavior of some status-messages players received during the invasion, our current theory is that there's an internal advancement counter which *would* eventually bring on the next step of the invasion, but is currently configured to cycle back to the beginning when we reach that point.
---
We expect the next stage to be opened at some point in the near future, perhaps after the Toronto event.
---
Ccp btw
---
Tribute already getting a bit boring eh?
---
I thought that was what CODE says about itself (because nobody else will call them that).
---
Conoco, for lack of a better term, is one person running like 30 alts. and a large dumpster fire that hasn't gone out yet.   
---
You would get more experience in Eve by going outside, then joining Conoco,
---
You're a redundant cunt. Stop reposting the same whining about removing local. It's a solution for the simple minded.
---
As it stands, the Fuzzwork Item List currently states that a lot of the Liminal Triglavian ships fire Mjolnir Heavy Missiles in addition to their regular Disintegrators. This may be a replacement for that. \[However, having not been in hisec for the last few days, I can't say whether or not the invaders are actually firing said missiles.\]
---
If you join a public fleet with logi then sure, if you go solo then your only chance is a 100mn meme fit but you still need to turbo bling it so you can outrun the cruisers and you need to kill stuff in the right order (webbing frigs &gt; scram frigs &gt; other ewar frigs &gt; other ships) and you need to keep up as much transversal as possible.
---
I think his whole shtick is that his is also cloaky. Yours isn't so not really comparable. But yours is a better combat feet, by miles.
---
Not if they don't set the active timer for the weekend...
---
I have the ability to log my accounts in right at DT before I go to work and could literally leave them logged in station camping all day.  This is USTZ eastern time.
---
Kinda sounded like it when you started to go on about how great wormholes are. Being a niche and awesome aren't mutually exclusive you know.
---
This has been too easy of a strategy since vuln timers were implemented.
---
The balance for this I would suggest would be a module like an entosis or hacking tool that you agress the stucture with, making the stucture automatically agress you back, and after a certain amount of time or succesful hack, one that can be counteracted by how you fit your stucture, the structure gets hacked and the Vulnerable timer can be moved like 2-4 hours or something.
---
also giving another incentive not to max sub or cap dps fit the stucture.
---
As someone who fights lots of koreans and russians and folks from those timezones in Amarr FW lowsec in the early US hours. This would be very nice.
---
But remember these people don’t want this type of content in the first place.  She’s not an aggressor in any sense no matter the context of her attacking a station.  
---
She’s only trying to attack the structure to end the war dec and prevent it for the next 2 weeks.
---
That sounds wonderful and glorious and terrifying, I love it
---
I like this, maybe struct size can affect variability too. Astra +/- 60 min, Fort +/- 120 min, Keepstart +/- 180 minutes.
---
My first ever Carrier.
---
I was using it to transport fitted ships... decided to jump to a kickout station. Thought i'd 200IQ it by burning my cyno frigate into the station @ 0 and then lite the syno.
---
I jumped the Carrier in, it immediately bounced off the station and started to spin. The local pirates took notice of the cyno, warped to it for an easy kill, only to find an unfit spinning carrier 10km from a kickout station. I was sulking as 2 Hurricane and a Taranis slowly killed me while i was trying to get an exit cyno in range..
---
pure blind is a wild place like it used to be, but both of these alliances do have treaties with deklein neighbors. blue donut doesn't only mean blue alliances, but "bluetrals" means they won't remove you from your home as long as you follow certain conditions (e.g. sov trolling).
---
independence is when you don't have such agreements.  these two alliances are far from independent.
---
Go back to world of borecraft then?
---
It's actually bots being called goons, in this case
---
Lol I wouldn't tell you to come to wormholes based on your responses, you clearly need to be in nullsec cuz that's the content you enjoy. But just because you focus only on nullsec doesn't mean that highsec/lowsec/wormholes are dead because of citadels. It's player mentality that's the problem, not CCP
---
Heh, even more fun was when it would forcefully eject whatever was in the shield and then shoot it.
---
Miss you guys :(
---
Bought a Thon's Modified Kinetic Deflection Field - i dont even remember the price it was so long ago, IIRC it was close to a billion - but there was a buy order for even more in dodixie - so I bought it in jita and hauled it over there - and thats when i found out the buy order was for 2 minimum... problem was there wasn't another one for sale. anywhere. I've been trying to sell this thing ever since
---
Bit presumptive. I live in null/wormholes and only really wanted to do this for the fun of it.
---
Defending our new recruits from high sec ganks is just a happy bonus.
---
Ccp wants to know your location
---
Or they screwed up royally and he doesn't want to talk about it with this person (or at all). They already did the required back-pedaling in this so it isn't "ongoing".
---
Oh snap i thought you were still with Brave and was gonna scoff at yall not being under an umbrella but apparently yall left Legacy!
---
BS, you just put the struct in an alt corp / alt alliance and game the mechanics.
---
seriously....timezone tank is a pain.
---
between citadel spam,  artificial damage caps, so many reinforce periods on even SMALL citadels(the ones that are spammed like popcorn), and timezone tank.
---
its a wonder CCP hasn't realized their goal of relying on giant wars in EVE to keep it afloat, is quite literally losing appeal every time a war is declared.
---
but instead of fixing it, they focus on Resource Wars 2.0...or 3.0...or 4.0.  whats it called now?  3.0 aka Invasion? how about updating the existing one to feel new (aka sansha), instead of canibalizing the playerbase for it to meet both, and then having both die.
---
Vargur is fun and L4's are quick.  Drop an MTU when you hit bastion, pewpew, salvage while you pew and be out in meenits.
---
You certainly can play this game solo and plenty of people do, however I would suggest that for the initial leaning phase you group up with people who can answer questions and show you a few things.  Learning to play solo is considered much more difficult that learning to play with people.  However, Eve is a game where you are to forge your own path so do what you want.
---
No it’s not.  That twitter poster the context is wanting to end the war dec made onto them by the aggressor.  
---
Perhaps the change should not be timers associated with structures but rather the Corp or alliance.  If you war dec me, my high sec (only high sec, not LS/NS/WH) structures all are timed to the war defenders times.  
---
They’re high sec war decs we’re talking about here.
---
In the same vein as a few other pipe dreams, I would like to see the timers as such:  
---
* Shield is 24 hours and once damage starts is a 15 minute timer.  Reduce total time needed to 15-20 minutes at damage cap.
---
* Armor is 6 hour vulnerability, 24 or 48 hours after shield timer and once damage starts is a 15 minute timer. Reduce total time needed to 20-25 minutes at damage cap.
---
* Hull is a 3 hour vulnerability 24 or 48 hours after armor timer and once damage starts is a 15 minute timer.
---
Also, a tax money grab.
---
I sense a market opportunity to create a space game like EvE that lets you kill your enemies bases in your timezone.
---
&gt;experience in PVP needed to represent lowsec
---
If you are angling for a position as the campaign manager for the author, you may want to tweak your aproach a tad.
---
That was the main reason, the less blues the more content.. 
---
You know how satisfying it was to defend our astra vs a 100 man condi fleet and 3 titans, while getting 1 of the titans in structure with only like 60 people?
---
I was initially in Brave but decided to tag along for the adventure DEQC had planned, my heart is always with Brave tho haha
---
Love my little venture. 
---
Question, how do you defend yourself from rats when mining gas? I'm mining pyro in 0.5 and shield/armor armor depleted before I can even get a lock on them and have drones attacking.
---
I have seen that done, but it was intentional.
---
I wish more people had your enthusiasm and zeal for an actual challenge.
---
damn u panfam, u win again!
---
Or perhaps some instability develops  in NS. Honestly though, I think most null bears would hate the idea of a more combative null. One that isn't just arranged wars (read play-date) to keep the line pilots entertained (read stop shooting all the blues).
---
fit a cloak on it then retard
---
I like this because it makes smaller structures have some viability instead of just "what ever you can afford".
---
yeah imagine wanting to pvp as opposed to just ignoring them
---
If you are talking about owning and flying biggest ships (titans) and structures and being independent small group then yes  
---
However, you won't be able to fly them in the first years without skill injectors anyway.
---
Actually yeah, that's a fair point. Im at work now but I'll try to edit them in on my lunch break.
---
Yeah but flip the shoe around - how would you feel if someone could just attack your base while you slept because of real life obligations and timezones??
---
I think people have forgotten that’s what eve is about.. I haven’t been playing that long but I had an actual challenge playing solo, then I joined a Nullsec alliance and it has been so safe and everything easy mode that I have started getting burnt out even though I love this game..
---
The feeling of danger and challenge is what makes this game unique, without those things it feels like an arcade game to me..
---
An astra can fight off one or two guys easily, assuming they can just get one dude to log in.
---
Kind of like most CCP projects. Fancy that.
---
Why do you think you're entitled to shooting my citadel?
---
When has that been true? Seriously. Bittervet and happy are polar opposite concepts.
---
Word
---
Yeah that was some propaganda. Every fireside every member is told to use in game reporting tools for bots.
---
Just quit your job and bash it retard. Casuals don't belong in this game anyway.
---
Awesome ty very much!
---
Oh don't worry about me. But as this is reddit some other people will read this. Personally if i was enjoying eve as a whole and started again id likely go to high or a wormhole.  
---
Highsec isn't dead, most of the active playerbase lives there.  
---
wormholes aren't dead, niche doesn't mean dead.   
---
Whats happening in lowsec, well while i do not have much of a thing to say for FW, for the lack of the other lowsec conflicts you can't entirely blame the players. One word is very important here: moons.
---
Lots of corps accept alpha players, just not all. You'lll have to figure out which ones do, I suggest searching for something along the lines of 'EVE newbro corp'.
---
He undocked to shoot vnis lmao
---
I lost my golem on a gate, bust bastion didn't save me...
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/49263960/

I was moving it from HS back to staging, and that took a a while.   An incursion started in the area and gate rats got me....
---
It's scheduled to release right after they finish the Mystery Code rewards.
---
Would be interesting if TEST made them stand on their own but I think we have too much invested in the way of the KS/Jump Bridge highway to let that sov flip.
---
It tells you everything you need to know, he's neutral about the structure, but a purist about the ingredients. So to him: no, a hotdog is not a sandwich. At least that's how I perceive the chart.
---
The game treats it as if you logged off where the citadel used to be. So the next time you log in, you'll be in that exact spot in space, in your ship, with any items you had in it when you logged off.
---
I read that as CSM tits. I can only imagine you now have CSM tits.  Poor feller. I can only hope after you get out of CSM your CSM tits go down.
---
That is beautiful!
---
Find yourself some muscle for hire. If they are still around, the Dirt Nap Squad comes to mind. There should not be any shortage of people who want to shoot someone in the face and get paid for it.
---
Looking for Gud fights in a solo Cerberus. Jump into a nullsec entrance that was heavily camped. Manage to get back to gate before webs and scrams landed. 
---
With shields ripped off I said Fuck that I'm going some where else, set destination to another system, hit warp jump. Didn't realize destination sent me back through the gate I narrowly escaped from. Not so lucky this time, in scram web range of a interceptor, Got blown up and podded..
---
Need to get rid of an entire timer
---
So you're just being racist?
---
1) if you don't blue up neighbors, you can't pve.  it just doesn't make any sense as you will be killled continuously and won't be able to do any industry. 
---
2) if you don't care to do pve and industry, then you don't need sov.  live out of npc stations or in a wormhole.
---
Ahh good. So goons have a “separate but equal” faction for lgbt. I’m not sure if you did well in social studies, but that’s not accepting them. Do goons have a special fleet for girls (femfleet) or other groups? If goons really were accepting of them they would be integrated in their normal fleets.
---
Btw, what this has to do with mittens being a psycho, I dunno,  but thanks for trying to hijack my comment.

AUSsies are a nationality? not a race?   
---
so no. (you suggesting they are might be raciste\~ tho)
---
Gila can run all sites, except for dark
---
You get informed when the bash starts and when it ends, and you get informed about who landed the blow that tipped it over from 96% to 95% shields. Example here: https://imgur.com/HYeqXAm
---
You are given no information about their composition or numbers, however you can extrapolate some info from how long they took to bash the shields (it takes about 30 minutes at damage cap, not sure exactly). You can also crawl through their killboard to get more info.
---
If that's been your experience, okay. If it isn't something you haven't actually done though, I wouldn't recommend it. Are you saying this as something you heard (or believe to be true), as a recruiter or an applicant though? There's a big difference.
---
Now that I'll gladly throw PLEX at.
---
Crunchy is for real men, heathen. Though I agree with you on location of storage.
---
problem is they also tend to be low-risk and easily accessed cloaky camped targets.
---
i diagonally upvoted this post
---
oh fuck, that's brilliant.
---
I've had my fair share of dumb shit, but what really bothers me is all those jaguars I lost to npc police because of negative sec status. It goes like this: smoke weed -&gt; decide imma go 1337 solo peeveepee, hey I have this jag sitting here -&gt; undock -&gt; stare at screen for 30+ secs -&gt; wtf who's attacking me -&gt; fucking hisec reeeee -&gt; ragequit for the night. 
---
I've lost like 4 in this exact way, only happens when I fly jags: at this point I dont fly jags anymore.
---
Do they want to give him a job?
---
How do I even get this? Theres no button to press to get it in steam. Ive made an account though steam, made username and password for it, and yet I still cant get it. Even downloaded the launcher from the website and installed it even though it was already installed through steam.

most of the groups who roam null poking the big boys tend to be wh based groups.  Volta and Inner Hel being the prime two.  One stages out of Thera, the other out of a C2 with a nullsec static.  This allows a much greater number of targets without having to go 30+ jumps between each target.  Also usually get a bigger element of surprise.
---
Wh groups that roam null also usually have significant access to wh based PVE for an income stream.
---
Well he meets the criteria
---
How did stront timers work again? Was before my time.  
---
EDIT: Nevermind, found it [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/POS\_Warfare](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/POS_Warfare)
---
I really like the T3 Cruisers. I use them for null sec combat exploration, Ive also done lvl 4 missions with them. I recommend Loki or Tengu.
---
If you wan to do high sec Level 4 missions, I would recommend looking at the Rattlesnake also. Very capable ships, not terribly expensive to fit up or skill in to.
---
It will come as a complete surprise to most of you but it’s actually a union thing where Triglavians are not allowed to attack in a month that has no ‘r’ in it. You have time to skill up for the right ships and modules until September.
---
Add timezone drift. Every time someone in the corp logs in the structure timers drift a bit toward that time. It'll naturally get the timers to be in the timezone that the corp is actually active in.
---
As corps stop logging in it drifts back to the set time. If corps go quiet for a while they can timezone tank their structures. If they're active at all then the structures are vulnerable when they're likely able to defend it.
---
For instance Test and Goons are bluetral.  We also tend to fight goons a lot more frequently than we do Panfam due to being neighbors, yet many consider us allied.
---
Why in the world would I play wow? I been playing eve since 2002, the game used to be much better, why get mad at me for saying as much?
---
Came here to say "this sounds like a time capsule from 2014."
---
Gnosis with 5 T2 huffers is gas huffing champ! :) More isk/hour than anything but a boosted venture/prospect with T2 buffers. And trains in like a few days vs a couple weeks
---
Only retards link to twatter
---
He is a cringe worthy retard who likes to pretend to be hitler because thats what all the cool kids and dumbchimpchilla like to do
---
...but it's not. The only advantages the Prospect has are the ability to warp cloaked and a 2x size hold. The former has never been relevant for me, and the latter has maybe once or twice tops. Much more relevant is the far cheaper price tag of the Venture for when you inevitably tab out at the wrong moment and get wrecked by the arrival of the rats.
---
Right there with ya my dude. It's one of the only games I haven't grown out of yet.
---
As someone who fought them for years in FW, they are a newbro isk-squeeze masquerading as partially weaponized autism.
---
They milk newbros who don't know any better for isk in a variety of ways, but my fav is making them pay 4x jita pricing for ships that their fcs (can I even call them that?) then whelp like the bads they are. Rinse and repeat.
---
It's kind of sad bc of their 4k members only 40 or so are active... That's how many potential eve pilots they've ruined.
---
Worms are the epitome of the "T1 Frigates" list.
---
If they could be made happy they wouldn't be bittervets.
---
In the future try making instant undock bookmarks over 150km from the undock point so you can enter warp and instantly be off station before anyone can lock you
---
While I am uncertain how much they have been active in the north, Panfam has certainly helped winterco against Legacy.  So why not add in their totals if we add in Brave.
---
seems like it was a bait contract and they were waiting for you.
---
A new one just spawned, so the answer is "in Sonama", apparently.
---
Oof. Where were you when you got hit?
---
Get in a Corvette and start hulling again. Next time don't collateral your whole wallet? 
---
Newbro here so that's all I got for ya. Can maybe send a mill or 2 later when I'm home if you want.
---
How is it fair for the attacker to set the defenders time? This game is global it will always be someones 4am.
---
I am the Twitter poster by the way.
---
But I do like your suggestions.
---
We won't let that sov flip. If any legacy JB holder starts failscading I'm sure TEST will just demand structure transfers happen so we can keep the logistics running while they unfuck themselves.
---
Being derogatory towards people you don't like the playstyle of isn't helping.
---
Worms are alpha friendly.
---
I think the Best solo ship for c3 is gila.
---
Delete rorqual. Double output and hold sizes of all other mining vessels. Give Orca compression. Problems solved?
---
Ive seen it s few times, where the stick itself relocates to a new spot at downtime while the rest of the pos is just chillin where you dropped it.
---
Glad to help. There IS room in this game to do stuff in small groups and solo, and too much fear that you "won't keep up" with the guys in big blocs. The fact is you've chosen a lifestyle, and a country homesteader "won't keep up" with the money someone in silicon valley makes. Happiness is the real value, and fun is the real value in eve.
---
Most lifestyles have PvE means to support themselves. Abyssal sites are also a HUGE help for that isk making and potentially pvp as well.
---
There are a few guys who readings of onlne rants. This would be a perfect example.
---
You and me both.
---
Pretty sure you replied to the wrong comment.
---
Yeah but so is botting and a string of other shit that is never enforced. It used to be worse you could jump all over the shop and not appear in local now its just used for log in traps. People used to do no local roams and kill 1000's of bots in a day. Funny thing was CCP banned them and not the bots, go figure.
---
Warped a Prowler from Jita to null with 80m in cargo or so, no big deal.  Got caught up in something on the other screen, blindly clicking yellow, jump, click yellow jump.  Landed in a bubble in kbp without realized I'd even gotten to null, was not paying enough attention to notice, cloak expired, turned back to see what the noise was in time to collect insurance.  Never turned on the fitted cloak, never moved, in a fast warping cloaky prowler that should have been nearly impossible to catch even with a bubble and gate camp.
---
Should use a cheaper ship if your not going to pay attention...
---
Right outside the Navy Assembly Plant at Jita. Undocked into a mess of ships all bumping into each other and tried to align to the star-gate and warp, but I appear to have gotten shot.
---
Yeah, the collateral thing was definitely a mistake, but I got greedy. It was a 1 mill per jump contract, and I was already in the area. Big oof.
---
Though it would seem the guy who killed me got shot for it, so I can take some small solace in his destruction.
---
The guy still thinks 10 million ISK is a lot of money. He’s going to be green as grass. A shit fit on the boat of someone who has no concept of what an expensive ship is yet should not be a surprise.
---
I mean, they _might_ be a race.
---
I refuse to believe regular humans could survive on a continent where literally everything is trying to kill you.
---
The wonders of the gnosis!
---
I'll put the structure in an alt corp/alliance and log it in once in a while in autz
---
a 2009 phone runs eve decently. Anything above it is bonus.
---
Maybe. It feels weird to have been singled out so swiftly in such a large throng of ships, but maybe people more experienced than I am can do that super fast. Or someone was just really trigger happy.
---
VR Ready
---
Only has ddr3 and a 1060
---
It’ll play eve but I would beat the guy down on price cause that’s not vr ready
---
How many clients? What graphics setting?
---
I'd eliminate timezone tanking by making all wardeced corporate structures go to a 24 hour vuln state after a wardec becomes active and able to be attacked at any time. Or second option only wardeced Corp's may attack structures regardless of timezones while war is active.
---
Is that a thing I can do? Undock at a farther point from the station?
---
Because bumping into ships on the way out really screws up my ability to escape as swiftly as I would like. It'd be nice to avoid the masses entirely.
---
She's probably a wardec Corp upset that she couldn't whelp a poor AUTZs structure while they're offline.
---
this
---
mandatory plug for /r/buildapc where you can probably build this same pc or better for less money
---
And a 2nd gen i7.
---
Out tearing down poses because we were moving. Blown to bits because the guy that set it up set it to shoot at criminals. We're in null, the only criminal here is my ganking alt that I threw anchoring skills on to do this teardown.
---
It says something about the interdictor class that we pretty much assume interdictor == sabre.  Maybe needs a bit of work so people actually fly Eris' et.al.
---
CVA (Provibloc) - providence based alliance that is the primary controller of the region and the sole coalition practitioner of Not Red Dont Shoot.
---
Inner Hel (wormhole) - large wh alliance that frequently rolls statics.  Probably the single biggest wh threat in null.  Does not own sov.
---
Bombers Bar (Public group) - not an alliance, but a Not purple shoot it public group that roams null out of drifter wormholes - and does cause quite a bit of damage.
---
Now for some of the major renters:
---
Brothers of Tangara - NC based renters in drone lands
---
Rate my Ticks (RMT) - NC/PL based renters in Panfam space, doesn't hold sov
---
Circle of Hell - renter holding group with connections to skill urself
---
TIKLE - smaller alliance and Legacy member, but primarily aussie based so they have a huge influence in their timezone.  also strong supercap presence for their size.
---
Would this computer run Eve well? Not at top rate but maybe running at mid range?
---
https://rover.ebay.com/rover/0/0/0?mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fulk%2Fitm%2F273867736914
---
Any help is appreciated.
---
I was so underwhelmed by the rest of the build I only just noticed the 2600 series i7 haha was about to edit my comment
---
Seems like Triglavian ran out of plex
---
You have to declare a Hs war dec HQ that a war defender can see to kill.  Other than that most high sec corps who don’t initiate wars will leave your shit alone without the need to be told
---
Look, its a pretty fucking terrible PC.
---
It will play EVE, you are not getting a good deal for your money however.
---
If this isnt just a troll you should probably contact a diplo for that inquiry. Reddit cannot help you there
---
&gt; They are EVE's premier PvP Guild
---
Don't know why others downvoted.  I thought that was clever.
---
To be clear, a hot dog is not a sandwich.
---
Do they actually call themselves a 'guild' though?
---
Cloak+mwd.  Or instaceptor.  Instas are vulnerable to smart bombs, but that's not a hugely common gate camp because you have to then have support ships to save the smart bombers from a real fleet.
---
accepted a CEO position. LOL
---
He was probably in a cheap ganking ship costing less then 10 mil.
---
It makes sense most of these numbers are already gone. Their attitudes felt really rude when they kicked me out from the channel even for just asking what the corp is for.
---
Never been into conoco but easily supposed to be horrible place for newbies tbh.
---
I don't have an exact fit for you, but I can tell you that your main considerations will need to be tank (\~800 dps sustained tank is probably enough) neut resistance (24 whatever-the-unit-is/second neuts in one of the anom waves) and then of course your dps and application. You'll need to be able to shoot something out to about 70k or you won't be able to finish some sites. If you fit a prop you can burn out toward that last battleship, but that's not really something I recommend.
---
I know a Gila can do it. I know a Rattlesnake or a Dominix can do it. I know a passive shield-tanked Myrmidon can do it *with difficulty*. A Tengu or Loki should be able to do it just fine, but I don't know anyone who uses those ships for this task.
---
I run Eve on my laptop.  It is Windows 8.1
---
I run up to 4 clients at a time, though I do play in 'potato' mode.
---
Honestly, if you started back in 2009 or earlier, you really don't notice the difference.
---
describe the reason please
---
I'm all for helping the merc economy but tbh I don't really care about the war dec. I just wanted an excuse to shoot something.
---
POS reinforcement mechanics BTW.
---
Realistically, nobody should give a shit about how HS feel. Just bring back POS reinforcement mechanics and be done with it
---
Not to mention that if you shoot the damn structure there's a good chance the wardeccers can just cancel the war before the final timer. So you either have to let the damn thing live or endure another week of wardeccs for a lousy astrahus.
---
The link blelow is how GoG left them when they forced them to quit facwar and move last year.    The CEO is real piece of work who scams his own members.   His corps is really him and his 12 alts and a few sycophants.    
---
[https://media1.fdncms.com/riverfronttimes/imager/u/blog/2603364/fergfire1.jpg?cb=1459654978](https://media1.fdncms.com/riverfronttimes/imager/u/blog/2603364/fergfire1.jpg?cb=1459654978)
---
Yeah, why don't you guys just bash the final timer on the day they didn't set the final timer to? Don't you have sphere.exe V4?
---
Probably just one maybe two. Running at mid range.
---
Why two systems?
---
When I was in major nulsec alliance, we'd have multiple corps sharing the same system.  We even rented multiple moons, but had to drop that for lack of interest.
---
I have an alt in a renter corp, and the small corp cannot well-use a single system.
---
You have my vote.
---
You need a ssd drive.
---
It will play Eve but this is old components. I hope you are getting a good price for that build.
---
Yes you should keep playing.
---
When you undock you get 30 seconds of 'invulnerability' as long as you do nothing, other than stop your ship. You can redock, align, target, warp in this time BUT it will instantly void your invulnerability.
---
I would say you undocked and choose to warp or align to your out gate. In this time an instalocking ship scanned you and assessed your cargo. And shortly after his alt wrecked your ship. There are many ships that can survive this volley, but I'll bet you were in a cheap ship. Ofc the firing ship is concorded, but simply another hauling ship scoops your loot and docks. This happens over and over in jita on a daily basis.
---
In future, try to avoid carrying more than what the killing ship costs to kill you. The tornado, that killed you costs less than 100mil to fit. (I haven't seen your kill but it's a safe bet this is what killed you). So in future, uuness you have specially fit haulers... don't carry more than 100mil colat. Sure that will make you very little in isk/hr. But frankly hauling doesn't pay for newbies to haul expensive stuff.
---
I would recommend either joining a group in your TZ or doing some missions to get your isk back. If you want to keep hauling for isk, join 'haulers channel' good guys there that can help you get setup for more specialised haulers fit and skill point wise.
---
If =&lt; toaster than will run eve true
---
It’s on eBay right now for 125$ I know it will go up but any idea what would be to much?
---
PH backstab? Noooo
---
Gobbins run from an ally in need? Noooo
---
But let's be honest... PH is the powerhouse in that coalition... Just saying
---
He was clearly much better at a cost-benefit analysis than I was. XD
---
Very much this. The idea that groups attacking a structure should be allowed to somehow force its timezone to match up with their own is frankly absurd.
---
The problem is that groups can set their own vulnerability timers to the opposite of their legitimate active time - so they can attack groups in their own TZ but those groups would then have to be up at 4am to retaliate.
---
It isn't a troll. I just need general direction where to look at. Thanks
---
Pure Blind has content again? BRB taking a gang to go shoot you guys.
---
TEST gave them space and Triglavs are now Rorq mining under supercap umbrella.
---
On eBay right now for 125$. How much is to much?
---
Are there any profits for conoco to recruit numbers of newbies into FW ? without adequate education.
---
why are you so mad?
---
Good to see some active smallgangers posting vids. Not a fan of how your gang looked on that grid, felt like you could've done much more with what you had. Not many gangs run logi tho, and if you get more practice and trust from your gang mates maybe it'll look better next time. Looking forward to the next vid.
---
yeah but it's my citadel u mongoloid
---
And Project Nova
---
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+M to open monitor.  
---
Look at the networking info.
---
If there are lots of calls listed the server is again having issues. It was pretty bad on tuesday too.
---
The attacker should not be able to choose the time zone...that makes attacking people while they are in bed/at work the best strategy. What a shitty play style.
---
The best system I think is one that doesn't give an advantage to either side: like Stront timers used to be. There should be a degree of randomness to it, and while the defenders had some (fairly unpredictable) control, neither side really gets to pick.
---
or one less Sun
---
In your hanger still, most likely.
---
The fundemental of ships in eve is they don't do much by themselves.  Basic movement, picking stuff up.  All the shooting, repairing, going fast, etc, is due to modules you fit to your ship.
---
What likely happened is they said "blah, blah, blah, go do X" and you went out to do X, and that requires afterburner, which was part of the blah, blah that you missed.
---
Go back to your hanger, look for the module, stick it on your ship, go faster when you activate it.  No biggie.  :-)
---
Thank you. That’s what I needed to know
---
Amen. I like to run the small shit and challenge myself. The economic support and friends in bort are great tho. PvE is boring and having a market to make isk supplying and corp SRP for small gang makes a big difference to how much time and energy I give to this game.
---
Smaller entities just can't afford an environment where content creators make money, in my experience.
---
I've always had a lot of respect for DEQC though, you guys gave me great fights when I ran shit for panhorde and your predecessors gave me many wonderful fights in Wicked Creek for TAPI.
---
You can find a diplo/diplo channel ingame. I'd look at TAPI's Bio. There should be a name/channel for questions like this. Same goes for all (major) alliances
---
That’s a decent price for this machine. 
---
If your budget allows it, add a SSD.
---
POS stuff still sells.  It is preferable for super ratting.
---
Don't expect decent refund for BPC, nor the modules for that matter.
---
I think the last time stuff was removed (Phoebe?) we got shafted on BPC.
---
I run small gangs in b0rt and get fights from Frat, Provi, wormhole groups, lowsec groups when we wormhole to them, and apparently I need to go to Pure Blind.
---
We have a lot of blues but most of them are in other TZs. In USTZ there are tons of people to fight.
---
It sticks you in a corvette.  If you have one, you get stuck into your own corvette.  If you don't, they give you one.
---
So, you can unfit your corvette and then "board..." and start collecting civi modules.  :-)  And that 1 tritium too.  Isk drip.
---
And gates to new kind of space.
---
&gt; pay 4x jita pricing 
---
horrible
---
Staging out of NPC null while holding sov is a very good strategy for a smaller alliance, as it effectively makes the sov expendable.
---
What are they doing to do, bore themselves to death ragecaging your staging while you guys just do a jumpclone deployment for content?
---
I was absolutely in a cheap ship. I had like 3500 shields, 500 armor, 500 hull, and a couple of expanded cargoholds. With all the riggings and such it was.. I dunno, maybe 7 mill tops. Paid for itself in my first hauling run.
---
Your advice is definitely sound, and something I should have definitely followed, but I didn't fully understand the danger at the time. They do say mistakes are how you learn I suppose. 
---
I appreciate the advice and vote of confidence. I did have fun last night, so there's surely ways to have fun in the future. I've got 29 days of sub left so I may as well try and make something of it. What kind of missions do you recommend?
---
I mean yes it's a different style of gameplay and can be fun but as others have said, this is more akin to WHs or groups who base out of Lowsec to hit targets (Do groups like LSH even do that anymore? I dunno)   
---
But regions like Venal, Syndicate and such are basically dead and the really only good pvp in null pockets like Delve and such are "Jump on ratters before the hammer falls"  
---
Those are fine, but I get the feeling that isn't what OP was looking for. There used to be good standalone alliances that play the nullsec game without being in a coalition but I think those days are long gone for now.
---
depends on the ship i guess, i live in w-space, dont know what kind of rats you have in 0.5, in hs i just used hobgoblins when i mined ages back
---
Oh absolutely. If you're a small null group you better be prepared for blops attacks. LOTS of blops attacks.
---
never tried huffing with gnosis, will check it out when i dont have what to do hah
---
&gt; The attacker should not be able to choose the time zone
---
Good thing that is exactly not what I said then.
---
&gt; The best system I think is one that doesn't give an advantage to either side: like Stront timers used to be. There should be a degree of randomness to it
---
You mean except for the fact you could time a tower by putting stront in it? You're US TZ and are getting harassed by an EU TZ group? Just put 1d 7h of stront in it.
---
Fuck the medal! Give him his own post so it gets seen!! (and karma)
---
As has been pointed out, that would require Eve players to play Eve using the mechanics as they were intended and not how they actually are implemented (the old [RAI vs RAW](http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?398993-On-RAW-RAI-amp-RAF) if you will).
---
And if we're gonna assume that Eve players won't game the system to their advantage (a bad assumption mind you) then the current citadel mechanics and even citadels 1.0 would work fine since players would set the vulnerability for when they are actually active.
---
Everything in Eve has to be designed under the assumption that taking advantage of a mechanic is going to become the meta.
---
When you undock you are immune to damage and you will not bump on ships until you ativate a modual or initiate warp so if you initiate warp to a bookmark 150km of the undock in a straight line your shipwont have to align and will instantly warp off
---
Just get in a frigate and undock and don't move your ship just set speed to full and burn off, people have bookmarks 500km,.1000 km ECT offstations
---
let me just fire up a few thousand alpha accounts... i'm sure it could even be automated to the point of being undetectable by any bot busting system since all i need to do is spam enter on the character select screen to launch the most recently chosen character.
---
Enjoy peeps :)
---
So personally I don't run missions, but there was a time.
---
Just get yourself a cruiser fit to your liking (and skill points) and test it in a high sec combat anomaly. There shouldn't be any risk of being tackled in them. If that works find yourself a level one combat agent and do the missions, rinse and repeat until you can do level two.. Then three... you'll have some isk and and Lyalty points to cash in and maybe your skills will have improved.
---
This is a lonely road, so try and make friends with people doing like stuff. Or as I said find a group to play with. Eve is much much better with other people
---
There is always a bunch of suicide gank Tornadoes sitting outside Jita undock and scanning everyone who passes. They see anyone with low tank and expensive cargo, they blow him up. They get blown up afterwards, but the loot that people drop makes it a calculated loss.
---
I clicked for the No Game No Life thumbnail.
---
Sorry I don't speak vodka
---
Couple necromancers...
---
And walking in stations
---
That witchcraft sounds crazy useful! I appreciate the tip.
---
worms can easily solo t1. use a small shield booster ii with dual small cap battery and max dps for lows.
---
What are some npc null alliances/corps with a good rep?
---
Right because eve isn't known for armies of alts and being afk for days at a time. Solid plan.
---
Thanks for the tips actually &lt;3
---
Their leader is a roach of eve, an infestation not likely to be purged till the whole house burns down. You should consider yourself fortunate not to have gotten in contact with one of their members. Had you been successful you would have dropped brain cells over the course of the conversation faster than if you spent the same amount of time chugging liquor. Do yourself a favor, block and move on.
---
edit: a short history of conoco accomplishments 
---
conoco in fw (lost), quits fw, conoco lowsec pirates (lost), conoco leaves low and goes to null, conoco nullsec alliance (lost), conoco leaves its own alliance and joins another... wonder what will happen next?
---
This. There are also similar groups that base out of NPC null, though not a lot of them are active right now. I think that's partly due to where they were based - Stain and Curse are much less lucrative when you can't supplement missioning (and potentially explo) income with border sov. The null pockets near lowsec region gates used to be unused and taken by these alliances for income.
---
The inability to put up jump bridges also makes staging there a pain in the ass. Some NPC jump bridges for the pirate factions, that you need standings with them to use, would help a lot. It wouldn't impact null players who live there as much, because you'd never be sure who in your fleet is managing the pirate standings or not. Like, if you were able to take some shitty border sov in Period Basis and missioned in Stain.
---
I think the reason a lot of these groups moved to jspace is exactly for this reason. Stain and Curse don't work as well anymore, Great Wildlands never did for isk (though thukker LP ain't awful), etc. FDZ in Geminate is still a cool staging system, but with panhorde at your door it's just small gang vs blobzilla 23/7.
---
Abyssal sites changed that though, and I think we'll see more abyss-based income supporting PVPers in these areas. Right now if I were a small gang corp, the places I would be looking to stage would be:
---
* C2/null
---
* C2/low
---
* Thera
---
* Venal
---
* Pure Blind
---
I think eve is going to evolve this way, as people get bored of big bloc null. Once the money settles and people figure out how to print isk in these places, the allure of TAPI/Goons/Panfam might lessen.
---
Will I leave? Not if this happens, I have a lot of friends in TAPI and if eve starts looking like this it means I have more people to shoot.
---
You're welcome :)
---
I don't understand why people bitch about these kinds of deals. Constant sov war is aids. Agreeing to fight each other but not engage in sov war is something eve alliances have always done. HERO was considered exemplary content creators and not a "blue donut" group, but we had NIPs with NC., Provi, and Goons while fighting our war with PL.
---
We fought those groups CONSTANTLY, both in our space and theirs, while fighting a sov war with PL.
---
Try Rock Onzo in game name.
---
Pure Blind is great. You have NPC sov and mission hubs to fall back to, abyssal sites, and a reasonable WH spawn rate. Why are people bitching about that? I think it's a great idea.
---
I couldn't disagree more. No area should be cast aside. HS is no less important to the game than any other area. It may actually be the most important since it's the first zone anyone sees. It's what will determine if a new person stays or not. It's also important in the event something doesn't work out and you have to regroup. HS is actually very important.
---
Mitochondria is the Powerhouse of the Cell
---
Guildor Corp. It's all the same thing really.
---
Tell me more...
---
Were you in my fleet? We had a lot of that
---
Make HS shit to drive people out of it. Hiseccers are fucking irrelevant
---
Lol... No
---
Impossible to answer without more info. Filament type, ship type, ship fit, character's skill levels etc.
---
But 8-9 minutes spare is decent, just get into a cheap fit, empty clone and jump in, see how it goes for you. I'm pretty sure you will have enough for the easy spawns / rooms, It will be the mid range and difficult ones you will have to watch.
---
Catering to TZ3 has wrecked many games and their timezones if not buried the game completely. I await the PvP game that successfully balances Timezones so that they can all have the same impact and require similar effort to achieve. From stealing the sigils in UO factions to capturing major cities in TZ3 when the fewest number of players have the biggest impact I wonder when devs will realise and deal with this shit once and for all
---
I don't expect you to agreed, because only people who don't like to be attacked play EvE in 2019
---
It's currently in structure timer... 11 days 21 hours. My god. Is such a timer really necessary when you have asset safety?
---
Can a mechanic not be setup to automatically set timers for when the defending guilds members are online the most by average. I have to imagine stats like that are easily kept.
---
The second half of this tip is to know where you're headed after you use that warp. Some hunters have bookmarks in the same places and can follow you, so get your second warp started right away.
---
I would think CCP could implement something to read the "prime time" of any alliance due to activity and losely restrict the ability to set timers to that time. It would certainly not be a perfect solution but it could be a start. TZ tanking is one of the most bullshit things in this game.
---
What part isn't true though? Instability would bring more conflict. The lack of ability to operate huge alliances that provide huge safe zones would be very healthy for the game.
---
The whole point of controlling large areas is to create your own high security space. Null doesn't hate high security space. It just hates OTHER high security space but loves its' own. One of the drawing factors of large alliances is the ability to experience isk generating content in relative safety.

&gt;If the attacker can influence the day of the timers

and....
---
&gt;Good thing that is exactly not what I said then.
---
Sorry, I must have misread this.
---
People live in Florida, too...
---
I don't think you can blame CCP for the fact that the game is played by people all around the world 23 and a half hours a day.
---
Got drunk and lost my Tengu to a level 3 mission.
---
I didn't say any part of it wasn't true. But you aren't building bridges by insulting people you dislike.

Except all you do is drive people out of the game instead of into other areas. EVE already has a poor reputation. If HS is made even worse then all people see(particularly new people) is a crap game. They don't think "Wow. This is trash. I should see what other interesting and dynamic content this game has to offer". Instead they say "Wow. This game is trash" and they just leave. 
---
Your idea is like cutting your throat to lose weight. It works because dead people get thin quickly. However, your dead. Not a good plan at all.
---
You would think there would be at least... 6 - 9 invasion points minimum.... but we get like what... 3 all in high sec....
---
talk about being lazy. We are going to invade you! just at this solar system that is all. 100 ships.. max. fear us.
---
not having others in your system is worth paying for
---
How would that work if you had multiple Wars?
---
What is this also just flipped the problem, so that Defenders would all set their time zone vulnerability to the middle of the night, so no one could ever credibly hold a war against them?
---
just hire someone else
---
t4s are much harder, but not THAT much harder. What is your dps, and what is your tank? Google some cheapish t4 fits, see how yours compares, and jump in there and try it out. Just be ready to overheat, and bring drugs!
---
If they quit because the safe space isn't good enough and they're unwilling to go to real space, the game's better off without them. We need less krabs, not more.
---
Solo isnt dead, its just the skill of dieing alone, in an increasingly less shitty manner each time, so not many bother. that fit is not only painfully expensive, but painful to look at. take for instance a legit solo loki loss for me from the other week [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76809751/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76809751/) . Every bit as effective, but its still a gamble as to whether there is a web perma tank loki waiting on grid(damn you rocky, you sexy beast of a man), or if the target is a super cyno, so you dont need the bling fit, just an effective fit. AND FOR GODS SAKE... use boosters
---
This is reddit, OF COURSE we can!
---
I don't dislike them since I don't even know them. I'm not building bridges since there is nothing to build a bridge to. Different play styles are just different. They aren't better or worse. In fact the only difference between null bears and HS care bears is one tends to proclaim itself as more important than the other (without any real basis). 
---
As for Bittervets, well the description is in the title. They are bitter (and thus unhappy) but I think they enjoy it.  =)
---
Sry I know this is five days old, but im bored at work reading through the weeks' top posts. :)
---
&gt;Exactly. Daily fights are an equal or superior source of content compared to timer fights. Particularly in the age of citadels, where people really don't have an ingame incentive to be on the offensive.
---
Daily fights are fun as long as a cyno doesnt go up.
---
But really there are a few problems layered into this and i really dont know the answer.
---
Engageability - People need to be able to engage and kill miners and crabs. Caps need to be able to participate in fights.
---
Counterplay - People should be able to outplay their way out of a hotdrop.
---
Making sure everyone can play - Have things matter that arent caps when theyre on grid. Cap drivers are already autistic, making them box some supporting sub caps (other than cyno alt) shouldnt be too much to ask.
---
Ultimately the nature of the engagement has to change. People shouldnt be able to insta engage a massive blob on a small fight and the sheep shouldn't be able to scurry to safety just because local chat isnt entirely blue. Whats the best way to accomplish this? I dont know.
---
&gt;The entire nullsec ecosystem (Fozziesov, citadel mechanics etc) is designed around timer wars. The idea was keeping the defense strong and not making it so that large alliances need a lot of space. To create room for smaller alliances and more diversity.
---
&gt;But it turned out people cared about daily content (and safety) more than timer safety. They cared more about the safety of their Rorquals. So they all moved in huge empires, the opposite of what was expected. It was the meta around daily content and not the timer content that shaped Eve's ecosystem in the last 4 years, by deciding who joins which alliance.
---
If daily content is more fun than that seems like a plus to me. If eve is going to move away from that, then empire clashing needs to be fun. I would say currently, its not. Its two sides deciding whether or not to bring their blob or avoid engagement until things look more favorable, meanwhile people need to grind timers. If the fight does happen, its a super slowmo snooze fest of alpha strikes.
---
Imagine being so shit and so unrecruitable you have to pay the most autistic alliance in the game so you can afk in their space
---
wtf is the range on your scram?
---
nvm 30
---
I did thanks
---
I often run relic sites in an interceptor, once you get to all 4s and throw on a couple rangefinders scanning's easy. I also sometimes forget my core probes when I'm running t3ds and hunting explorers, so I just scan the site down with combats, pull probes, and laugh when he goes "hah I'm cloaked he didn't find me", tries to run the site under my nose, and gets caught.
---
Most you'll get out of me is gf ccp.lag()
---
My last loss I had like a 10s module activation delay on my scram and got kited.
---
you can run in anything, so long as you dont intend to engage the biggest blobs
---
rr domis are probably the cheapest doctrine i can think of that could maybe hope to engage big blob, but megathrons + nestors are probably the most cost to performance efficient
---
if comes down to that if you dont have enough ehp, you get alpha'd before reps land... smaller ships inherently dont have much ehp
---
You sir need to buy yourself a curse
---
1- Yes, you can bookmark the site. If it's gated, you have to slide the gate for each room though otherwise you can't get to the wrecks. Also wrecks disappear after 2 hrs. 
---
​
---
2- asking experienced players, watching videos, reading wikis, eve survival etc. You can play around with fitting simulations to see how and why they work for specific activities. It's a big learning curve. Also, no matter how good a fit is, someone will have an opinion why it's not the best. 
---
3- No. These won't give you a weapons timer. 
---
4- largest charge that could fit is usually the best for rechargers. Whatever keeps you stable for batteries,the smaller the better since you have room to fit other things.
---
To have fewer Krabs would need a couple of things to happen. you need more people and you need less stability. Krabbing is a fact of life and EVE depends on their results to keep all other aspects of the game functioning. They are required for a healthy game environment. Without them your items get to be too expensive to risk.
---
Making HS terrible to make the other areas look good is like finding a flat tire on your car. Instead of fixing the flat you flatten the remaining three tires so they are all the same now. Don't do this. Purposely ruining part of your product to show how good the rest potentially could be is hellishly bad product design.
---
Heh. I warped in on a sleeper. I didn't know what it was - it informed me, and pointed me.
---
While I was still trying to figure out what to do about that, someone in brave newbies blapped my ship and podded me.
---
Suddenly I was not as interested in trying to do things in a wormhole...
---
Wangspin is what any ganking corp should aspire to be, they're hilarious. While I have no respect for them as enemy combatants, they're almost universally entertaining.
---
They also love to bite bait.
---
I think we are all losing sight of the context here. One year ago, there was literally nothing you could do to prevent getting War decked other than not being in a corporation. Then they change it so you could opt out of wars by not having structures. Then they changed it again that you can actively end Wars by attacking the people who declared war on you.
---
So we are effectively complaining about some fairly minor stuff here, all things considered. The system is already in a hugely improved place. The real problems here are General structure of vulnerability issues, not the War deck system.
---
"legal services"? This I gotta hear.
---
Well i'm not going to continue to converse with you. I don't consider anyone's playstyle lesser than any others so i don't feel the need to use derogatory language to describe them.
---
Or have a formal receipt of wardec that allows the CEO of the aggressed corp to set the timers.
---
Honestly I'd love to see wangspin have a special offer for new player torpedo delivery. Help teach the newbros while continuing to generate funny lossmails through reimbursement.
---
FW is not the only lowsec activity... 
---
My contribution to the convo is this: Lowsec needs a Mordu's Legion spawn rate buff to not only help de-stagnate lowsec, but to also incentivise lowsec settlement while bringing the Mordu's Legion hull price inline with other pirate factions (ex: a bil for a pancake, not optimal).
---
This. Everyone has 4-4 instas. Including the gankers.
---
I think balancing a mechanic like this would be really hard. Definitely there would need to be a requirement other than one person successfully hacking a structure, since hacking is going to be pretty easy in most instances.
---
It needs to be timed. It needs to require multiple people hacking at once. And there needs to be huge consequences for failing a hack, including the destruction of the hacking ship and potentially the lockdown of the computers it needs to be time. It needs require multiple people Hawking in one. And there needs to be huge consequences for failing a hack, including the destruction of the hacking ship and potentially the lockdown of the computers so they cannot be hacked again for a significant amount of time.
---
Yup. Bait contracts suck and never haul more than your tank can handle.
---
"Any joke that needs to say 'I am actually quite funny' is not funny." -Tywin Lannister, sort of
---
The specs listed for that machine should have no trouble running EVE. The CPU is elderly (intel i7-2600, from 2011) and using DDR3 RAM, so it will lack upgradeability. If you wanted to upgrade it in future you would need to replace the CPU, RAM, and motherboard simultaneously. Though at the price it's currently bidding for, it's not a bad deal, assuming it's actually in good condition.
---
That would make TZ tanking even easier and you could change it depending on who is attacking you. In case you meant the aggressing corp that would creat the opposite problem that attackers from EU could just farm small groups of the USTZ and vice versa.
---
The defenders should still have the advantage that they can set their timers to their TZ but the ability to TZ tank by putting stuff in the AUTZ or whatever even tho you are not active in that TZ should not be a thing IMHO.
---
I wouldn't mind paying more ISK if it meant less turbokrabs bitching about how hisec "isn't safe enough", other space needs improvements but hisec itself needs to be less appealing
---
Why don't we just double the number of vulnerable hours for every structure?
---
And good luck finding my one 0% percent POCO in j space.
---
Yeah, I don't like the 'bring back stront' brigade's argument for this reason. Forcing a structure to come out of ref on the attacker's schedule is just as bad in terms of inconveniencing people, but losing a structure because you couldn't be online at that time is much worse than not being able to shoot it.
---
But defenders should not be able to choose both the day and a tight time window. If we think it's fair to let them choose the day (and I kind of do - lots of people are way too busy to spend 3 hours in a space game fight on a weekday), then the timer window for an attack should be much wider, at least 8h.
---
First, no derogatory language was used. Second, Your point and mine are the same point. No play style is lesser than the other.
---
Yeah, this isn't really a complaint about the wardec changes, it's just another thing that's exposed the problems with citadels.
---
Well, you're not wrong.
---
Well, it seems the best option is to take both regarding what I want to do :p
---
I will wait to be in a suitable Corp and see what they focus mainly and stick with it.

There's a lot to like about this.
---
Duuuuuudeeeeee you got a tattoo.
---
Not sure I would take to much into that. Horde links "join horde" to corps in our own alliance :) That said, the PanFam band of brothers is strong.
---
&gt; We need less krabs, not more
---
I'm not sure I can get over the irony of someone in a nullblob alliance saying this, while complaining about people in other areas of space which are far less krabby.
---
No stupid questions right?  If i own a poco but no station, am i wardec eligible?  My alt corp owns 33 customs offices but no stations.  Never bothered to check and im at work...
---
I don’t really see that it makes a difference.  If they choose an odd time zone, they’re still obligated to defend it; if it’s not their native TZ, then they fuck themselves as much as they do the aggressors.  We both seem to agree that defenders should have the advantage, so why not give defenders the same advantage that SOV defenders in null enjoy... at least until CCP solves the larger issue of time zone tanking.
---
It also has a much larger cargo hold, meaning you can carry a depot. And 25% more mining bonus than the venture gets (at expedition frigate 5.) It has a much stronger capacitor and on top of being armor tanked has a signature reduction per skill level.
---
Thx for the advice. But I only got minmatar ships leveled, I prefer to stick with this path
---
Except High Sec IS less safe than null. In HS miners can be attacked at will since there is no mechanic to defending yourself other than surviving the alpha strike. In null you can just shoot anything you don't like and you can shoot first.
---
HS is already not appealing. However, null and LS are also suffering from a lack of broad appeal. To get people interested in moving to a better area you need an actual BETTER area to show. Null is not as cool as you may think it is. You may like it, but it isn't everyone's cup of tea.
---
Sansha relic sites made my last mentee his first billion in a week. Grab a newbro exploration frigate, head for NPC nullsec (Stain for Sanshas or Delve for blood raiders) or sov space with those rats (though you'll have more competition for sites from the locals), make safes, scan sites, get loot, and learn to move through null.
---
You can also use wormholes to get there, or find sites in c1-3 wormholes. Those sites are sometimes cloaky camped, sometimes very safe ways to make money.
---
You'll lose some ships, you'll lose some of the loot, but you can pull great money this way. I wish there were more ways to make serious isk in a newbro-friendly way like this, especially without joining a null corp and afk ratting in a vni. Anyone can do this.
---
I wake up at 0430 to workout before work. I’m sure you can figure it out tbh fambalam. It’s not like you have any commitments at 0400.
---
This sounds like a personal choice.
---
i'm keeping mine next to the lux crystals. o wait..
---
Yeah this in particular is retarded. The length of timers in K space is dumb at the best of times, but certainly when you have declared it as your war stronghold, its timers should be reduced down to J space levels.
---
Yeah it's worth it, there are ways to make isk. Relic sites in null/wh space, ninja gas huffing, salvaging the triglavian invasions, these are great isk for a newbro.
---
&gt; 25% more mining bonus than the venture gets
---
Not for gas mining which is what most people use mining ships for in J space

Did you go with rapid light missiles on this due to fitting reasons? Because I would imagine heavy missiles, or a heavy missile and Rapid light missile split, would be more effective. Heavy missiles will hit out to 100 km, which pairs nicely with going 6000 meters per second.
---
Also can you explain what your whole fit is? I can't really work out the tank with my Theory crafting, everything I can come up with is pretty low. Makes me wonder if it is better to run dual large ancillary Shield boosters.
---
Yeah no shit. Invasion? More like 3 sigs in all of my area at all, and they seem completely harmless unless you attack them.
---
Why is eve not dangerous during something called "invasion'.

Completely disappointed.

What i learned from AT practices on thunderdome and sisi, is that some menus most likely need server responce. When we were leaving corp, it crashed some service on CCP side and right-clicking characters didn't show context menu for everyone on the server.

So it might be laggy connection or slow server response as well.

You'll have a lot more in common with people here than you think.

What do you like doing outside of Eve, why do you find you have little in common? I honestly found the opposite in a lot of corps, being too mature for the constant spam of pubg memes and holocaust jokes, so I went back to test lol.
---
&gt; someone in a nullblob alliance saying this
---
According to reddit, I've been in PL, NC, TEST, Goon's special snowflakes corp, and TEST again in the last 24 hours. Might want to rethink that comment sweetie
---
First page!
---
That's just not accurate.  CCP has made numerous small bandaid tweaks to FW over the years, most recently they made changes to disallow warp core stabs into FW plexes.  Unfortunately, this bandaid resulted in breaking the "plex sliding" mechanic, which opened up another can of worms.
---
This example is representative of both what CCP has done with FW, and the kinds of changes you are proposing.  Your proposals are not comprehensive, despite their breadth.  Like I said, I appreciate the attention, but in my opinion you haven't thought this stuff through in sufficient depth.
---
You could join Unspoken Alliance. We just finished scrubbing UA out of Etherium reach after a pretty bloody campaign so they are probably looking to carve out a new home somewhere.  Although UA is mildly aligned with goons. Or join Horde and fight goons... Never a lack of content with Horde.
---
POSes will be extinct soon and before citadels that was the only way to really hit an important system.  Blobs get bored and move on, it was the small groups of neckbeards fighting tooth and nail for days that got the real work done.
---
The best times in FW were hitting/defending important systems and something as simple as a gatecamp could shut that down.
---
What the fuck is w-space?

I might not know much, but I know I like that gif 👍

Whenever [MCKen3311 Daugherty](https://zkillboard.com/character/91530336/) shows up in local in something cloaky, you know you are in for an easy payday. 318 bill lost with that killboard. Whew.
---
:)
---
I think a killboard link is in order for maximum laughter/tears
---
Since the bigger a group gets, the more greedy it gets, taxable LP would be fairly simple.   Passive corp/alliance level incomes were shit and removed for a reason.
---
no, they will just kill the structure you're jump cloning to and now even if they don't take the sov it might as well be useless. The problem with smaller groups and sov is not taking it necessarily, its holding and more importantly using it, because if you're not gonna use it for anything what even is the point of taking it
---
I strongly agree with you, having just joined FW it's annoying when i'm trying to capture plexes or get fights and people just up ship and super bling to stomp t1s. You aren't looking for a fun fight when you bring your deimos to shit stomp a moa, or when you bring your snaked 300 mil worm to just 10mn ab kite stuff to death. Citadels are annoying for fw but i'd almost say it's a good thing that you can stage since it allows easier reshipping and fights in system (although i'm still mixed feelings on tethering). Also every fleet fight with battleships i've been a part of in low sec since i started dipping my toe into fw about a year ago has had third party caps.
---
ok. BTW, for the TC3s you will have to level up all 4 subsystems to 5 to really get them working properly.
---
What are the tears about now?
---
What's your budget?
---
Every neutral party moon mining in FW space would create 2-4 separate alt corps and switch ownership of the structures to that of the controlling faction.  It would add zero content to the warzone and would only make it easier for said parties.
---
It's kind of funny how being bad at expressing thoughts coherently knows no borders, nations or language. When people type out their thoughts, they often do it from the point of view of "I got some thoughts to type" rather than "people are going to be reading this and I want to communicate my thoughts". As a native Russian speaker who's been out of the Motherland for more than twenty years now, sometimes I read these RUS things in local and wonder if I'm getting that bad at understanding Russian because shit makes no sense. Then I read something in local in English and it makes just as little sense, and ah yeah, I feel much better.
---
my suggestion would be to delete anoms and use the triglavian invasion ai for all pve content
---
I'm just going off what you're flaired as. If you're some edgy flairbaiter who thinks I should know who you really are, well, sorry to disappoint.
---
But all those alliances you listed are krabbing nullblobs anyway, so it doesn't really affect the point.
---
Open zkillboard look at BR = Answer!

Yeah, that's why we came to wormholes, the wormhole community is very different in terms of what kind of fights they want

it never fails to amaze me how people are so bad at the game they actually believe this
---
"The only way to win is not to play."
---
&gt; Null is not as cool as you may think it is.
---
Null is a fucking blobfest, FW is full of snuff dropping supers on subcap fights. It's still better to have people there, where they'll find out that shooting players exists, than in hisec. Better yet, maybe some will find their way to wormholes and try PVP that doesn't involve wardecs or cynos
---
Honestly walking in stations was needed followed by combat in stations. Find the jita scammers bust open their cabin doors then kill them.
---
It's actually a commonly used term and is used in the same context as calling someone a pvper or trader. It's also a term that would apply to me personally since my primary focus is pve and I actually enjoy ice mining. I can't explain the ice mining. It's a sickness.  =)

What about instead of letting the defender pick the exact hour that is best for them - how about we go about it backwards - and instead the defender gets to "ban" 1 block of 8 hours - still leaving 16 hours "open"
---
That'd be Casey. Guy is a machine.
---
&gt;  it doesn't really affect the point.
---
Because of course my flair is definitely going to have been the corp I'm actually in, right?
---
That is not how that works out in reality. Example: Group A &amp; B are from the US TZ group A has set their timers to the AUTZ so now if group B wants to attack them they are going to have multiple *very* long nights ahead of them if at all because they probably have to work.
---
The purpose behind forbidding TZ tanking is not that structures die more often but that there are more fights about them. If it would work out that way is in question sure maybe group A would just let their structures die in US TZ and not fight at all but at least the time is favorable to creat content.
---
Sidenote: IDK if you ever grinded structres for a week or two on end in odd TZs without any content besides having to care that your guns still cycle it is one of the most boring things you can do in this game. In comparison mining is engaging and ratting outright fun and we all know that neither rly is.
---
?!!?!???!?!!?!?!?!?!
---
They can kill stations in lowsec/hisec/npc null now?
---
They can take the sov back, most of the time when alliances did that they kept one or two ratting systems at high ADMs and the rest was just there as a content driver.

If they get facerolled they get facerolled, that's what taxes are for.

---
Yeah that's the guy.
---
Perhaps new people would find their way to these areas. Perhaps they aren't interested in them and prefer to be a trader in Jita. Who knows what people will like, but if the first thing they see as a new player is a train-wreck of a game they will never stay to even think of going to those areas. There's an old saying that first impressions are everything. It's very true. Perhaps EVE should try to have a better first impression instead of putting new players in a crater of a zone.
---
Wouldn't it be cheaper to just go with a conventional model builder company and have traditional plastic moulds made to cast the models from?
---
1. Set an alarm clock. People used to alarm clock for their fucking skill queue. If they could do that, you can alarm clock for 3 timers.
---
2. Hire someone. Plenty of people will blap a structure for you in hisec for some isk

Seriously, why do you assume he does solo stuff on his dreddit CEO main who's constantly deployed somewhere in null and might need emergency jump clones? He even mentions using alpha accounts to do FW.
---
The problem with Hawaiian pizza is that there are more bad versions of it than good, so people tend to think it is horrible.
---
The best pizza shop I've ever known in my life (52 y.o.) went into the crapper when they changed cooks.  Haven't found a decent place since.
---
My personal all-time favourite:  Mexican pizza.  Never found anyplace that has heard of it since. nor can do it justice.  Notably it had Jalapeno and yellow/red hot peppers (and a bunch of other stuff), and even people that HATED peppers, loved the Mexican pizza.  It was a real crowd pleaser.

Ninja Loot wrecks is null. There's a war on in Tribute right now. Here is what you do: 
---
 - Get something with a reasonably large cargo bay. 
---
 - Add all of the warp stabilizers.
---
 - Add shield tank.
---
 - Add AB overprop.
---
 - Create alpha clone as a scout and put it in a fast align, weaponless, tanked rifter or something. 
---
 - Use the scout to ensure your ninja looter won't run into a fleet. 
---
 - log out scout, log in looter.
---
 - wait for the battle. Once it starts, warp to a wreck not in a bubble. 
---
 - loot all from the wreck.
---
 - warp to a citadel in system.
---
 - deliver your loot (it's ok if it's an enemy citadel)
---
 - repeat.
---
 - once the battle is over, either asset safety your loot to lowsec, fire-sale it on contract, or remotely sell it some other way.
---
 - profit.

Ok? None of that makes it not derogatory. It's a term born of hatred. It's definitely not the same as pvper or trader.

I hate pineapple pizza, now how can I vote for you :(
---
Third times the charm... i guess.
---
So much about this game I still done't know.  How is a POS superior for super ratting?
---
You make hisec good, you'll have a load of twats complaining about how an area you shouldn't stay in for more than a week isn't making them even more isk/isn't safe enough. Hisec already has enough retards mining/missionrunning in it, let's make those numbers less
---
It's a gas station........that is all
---
you serious mate? its wormhole space, quite addictive place to be honest.. once you get in, you never want to go out
---
Easy just use a target painter
---
That takes alot of starting capital and really only pays out if you can produce a ton of them and sell them. There are hundreds of ships you could produce so on demand 3d printing is better for smaller custom orders.
---
Don’t forget you can try out both approaches on the test server :)
---
Hiseccer = hisec inhabitant. If you fucking *live* in jita, you're irrelevant :)
---
Do you play eve? I'm serious because like 99% of the player base has more than 1 player corp on their history, yes that includes me
---
&gt; reddit likes to insult renters
---
Well, everyone who isn't a turbokrab or running a rental program does, really.
---
T3 can be used for way more
---
I don't know anything about the politics of this corp or anything, all I can say is that dude seemed to step down professionally.
---
&gt;They can kill stations in lowsec/hisec/npc null now?
---
they can kill citadels and poses, and if you're gonna be staging out of npc* null those are pretty important for bridging and clones.
---
&gt;They can take the sov back, most of the time when alliances did that they kept one or two ratting systems at high ADMs and the rest was just there as a content driver.
---
you gotta be able to rat in order to keep those adms up, its fucking retarded but its the way it is. Wrangling pvprs to keep adms up enough for a nearby bloc to not be able to stomp them, and doing that while under the threat of said bloc by themselves is kinda unrealistic, and honestly very boring. Also sov being a content driver is a nice meme, more like griffin driver, and they have more griffins than you.
---
&gt;If they get facerolled they get facerolled, that's what taxes are for.
---
money is hardly the issue tho, its more a question of why to take sov in the first place. Sov warfare is not especially fun and the rewards per effort for a smaller pvp focused group gets from it is quite low, might as well just stay in npc null at that point. There is a reason you don't really see small groups staying with sov, you see them taking it then either aligning or dropping it.
---
Well say goodbye to your social life. As you said this MMO has a way to capture ones time.
---
Also little story of my own when I started this game I also read a lot and watched a lot of videos trying to learn the game (for like 8h a day). That ended up being a cause for our alliance CEO to suspect me being a spy because "no new guy knows this much about eve". But that was in a random small alliance and the CEO was a dickhead thankfully my corp CEO had my back. 
---
Anyway I hope people in Brave are different. Enjoy your stay and I hope to see you in space. o7
---
I have owned one as well, though I need to get another as my last one met an unfortunate end.
---
As long as idle alts are not counted, this would work. Could even have it where it’s the average of both parties involved based on total active players. Basically the smaller group would have more influence or less.
---
I suggested stuff like this a long time ago, but the vocal minorities opposed it and similar things. If they can’t game a mechanic to make it safe, they hate it. Spineless cowards.
---
Not sure, you could go either way.
---
Make sure you don't get scammed
---
Resource wars also needed a fuck ton of site grinding to get to the more interesting sites and i was never really a fan of it's mining component.
---
Wowowo... Slow down bois. Module tiercidite first, okay?
---
My trade alts live in Jita. So do thousands of others'. 
---
I guess they're irrelevant.
---
Lol.
---
That's the point of tying the amount of possible mining support to FW activity on the part of the structure owners' corp/alliance. They literally *can't* do that unless they also actually significantly participate in FW on those alt corps - at which point they're providing content. If they just have refineries sitting there on alt corps that otherwise do nothing, they get no NPC mining support even if the alt corps are in FW.
---
idk, i can do all the sites for all the factions. it didn't require that much grinding tbh.
---
So you're saying that I'm attacking myself now? I think you may have misunderstood the term a bit. Care bear is a term much like the term "shipmate" is in the navy. It can simply mean someone who is a fellow crewman on your ship, or it means you're an asshole. It depends on the inflection. Care bear is simply someone who is not pvp focused. They primarily are involved in pve. Another therm used (apparently based on some Russian term) is Krab. Some times the call will go out to "get Krabbing guys!" or it could be "all these !#@% Krabs!!".
---
I am doing well, joined NJED about 2 months ago and been having lots of fun. Hope you guys are doing well!
---
i mean the timed mining mechanic was pretty ass
---
Oh yeah, I understand that one.  Thanks again.  Next will be to see what I even want to do in the game.  Don't have the gobs of time to play all at once like I used to.
---
Well no, I'd consider a trade alt about as relevant as a VNI alt.
---
All 3 of the original sites were cleared in 48 hours
---
i will buy  praxis  1:1 scale then and turn it into hotel
---
if you were trying to solo it, yeah it was horrible.
---
Glad to hear you're having fun!
---
Don't hesitate to go get involved in stuff, keep an eye on pings and just join up with them - They're all new player friendly (except bombers). Hit up dojo chat for free handout ships if you need some to take on a fleet.  Also check out some of the slack channels for things you might be interested in - Hole Divers is a great one for dipping your toes into wormhole space while learning a lot about how the game works.
---
Hasn't happened yet.
---
I don't judge for what people put on their Pizzas. I've eaten pretty much every kind of Pizza concoction there is. I don't care, anchovies - sure, goat cheese - bring it on, kale - great. As long as it tastes good; has a happy-medium thickness of crust; isn't too floppy or too firm; not dripping with grease; the entire collection of toppings don't slide off when I bite into it; then I'm good to go.

Your mistake is thinking only Aus people are fucking with your shit during that time.....

__Delve begs to differ.__
---
Welcome to the game! Enjoy Brave, and try a little bit of everything, even (and especially) if you're not "ready" to do it. For what it's worth, I wish I had tried exploration more as a starting player. The ships are cheap, you can make good isk, and, while you will be avoiding combat rather than seeking it out, it teaches you good skills - awareness about your surroundings, thinking about how others are trying to hunt/catch you, etc. (Mix in a lot of pvp with that isk, too. You can use the explo as a way to find targets - make notes about the ships in space that you see in your innocuous Heron, then come back with a friend in a combat ship a bit later to get rid of them.)
---
Welcome to the Hotel Jita 4-4
---
Its still worth paying for not having randoms in your system. Proof? People do it.
---
I have none. I absolutely did not want to be in a null sec alliance and so that rules out most corps. I also am not on in any groups prime time since i work odd hours. I decided, through a process of elimination that WH space might be best. However, I feel that being a solidly contributing member is critical for me so I trained up to T3 cruisers and their fittings. By the time I did that I no longer even cared about undocking. Thus I've only been in one NPC corp.
---
Holy shit some people are retarded. Not knowing Australia is a country and therefor a nationality and not a race is fucking alarming to say the least.
---
Holy shit education. No wonder EvE is filled to the brim with nerdspurgers.
---
I would have replaced his ship if he had been a good sport about it. I really would have.
---
they should partner up with the eaglemoss people who do the star trek die-cast ships, they are great quality.
---
Same tbh. I got interest in eve well before I had a pc and watched tons of videos so I had a pretty decent grasp when I eventually did start
---
Wow, got to love reddit. You complement a guy on his fitting skills and you get called a retard. Maybe I should have said your fit was shit too, you would have thanked me then.
---
Good luck with your future posting my friend.
---
That's what I like to hear. I usually do the same.
---
The point I'm making that you're missing is that Nullsec may be the combat pvp heart of eve, but hisec is the trade and manufacturing pvp heart of eve.  It's not even close.
---
It's relevant, you just didn't know it until now.
---
To hear people in null sec tell it, they already suffer from the same problem in null.  =)   I think it's safe to say that human nature will make this always true in all areas in varying degrees. Besides all those same people who like mission running in HS will do is mission running in NS. I would put money on some of them already doing just that in both areas.
---

Tomato Potato, same difference.
---
And you fail to see how that's part of the problem? 
---
I don't think the opinions of a FW alt regarding the state of lowsec are any more valuable than a flashy red's opinions on sov.
---
Let's just ask botters about high sec and WHers about filament usage while we are at it.
---
praxis can have around 12k cargo and 6 t2 mining lasers and 2 ice mining drones.

I agree with this 100%. My opinion is the way pos worked was better.

wait. containers can  make your battleship  able to store more?..
---
Savagely and brutally honest just like Eve.  That's what I love about this game.
---
Had an argument with CCP stardust , he ended up Permabanning all my accounts !
---
&gt;... let's face it, entitled, about the game or even the tools surrounding the game. 
---
Its not cool for players to be ugly to devs, but you cant use the world entitled in a derogatory way when people are paying for the product they want changed.
---
It's eve, never not put it in local.
---
This. If I had not taken the bait, I would never have gotten the salt.
---
I would be good with 5-600.
---
Inb4 unfulfilled floating Nyx preorders.
---
When you think about it, it gets worse. He spent 1 hour to get 1 mil. To him, that's 100 hours of work.
---
But then they can do the reinforce in a timezone that's worse and come in for the kill at a time that's better. Part of the issue with citadel timezone tanking is the owner can punt the timer to a reinforce where they know it'll favor them.
---
They don't have to show up to every ping, whereas with the old system if someone was hitting your tower in your timezone they were doing it for real and they would get to kill it when it exited if you didn't respond now.
---
Essentially it put the burden of defense on the actual defenders, rather than the timezone.
---
Hey dude. I get you. You're welcome back when you want to come back. You shouldn't feel guilty about how you choose to enjoy your life. We live our own way and by our own decisions.
---
You can't be bumped out of a forcefield (unless you are not totally in it).  'Bowling' is considered an exploit.  You can also dock in a X-Large Ship Maintenance Array (155 million m3), though that would be folly unless a personal corp.  POS also have limited automated defenses.
---
You can be bumped out of Upwell tether, and you can't dock a super in anything other than a keepstar.
---
Large POS is also a lot cheaper than a keepstar.
---
I think there is also a timer issue preventing tether and docking in Upwell (or if your fighters are still out).  I believe this is the primary reason.
---
Yeah if you actually think hisec is the manufacturing heart of eve you have mental health issues, and the PVP there is worse than the supercap blobfest in null.
---
Better to have them krabbing like autists in NS where we can all freely shoot and bubble them than doing it in HS and bitching about how the security there isn't perfect
---
Cool video. But I just keep shaking my head at people's UI setups, many of them (this one included) are SO inefficient you waste a ton of time keep an eye on the important stuff and clicking any buttons.
---
Is it turning clockwise?
---
Lemme know when you figure out how to read an MER.
---
It's not even close.
---
It is basically a scam. They just mass invite eveyone and loot the ratting taxes.
---
Congrats, you made it past the first login.
---
Never Forget the Hover Nyx
---
Again all those concerns will still happen no matter what. If you want more people doing it in null then you just need more people and to do that you need new people to actually stay in the game. That's why you should be very much for zone improvements in all zones, including HS. More people makes for more opportunity (in most cases).
---
LOL I know right? Haha oh well. I adapt, but I do think Discord is better.

I would use ebay to find a deal on the parts you want, after you find out what those parts are.
---
I wouldn't pick up this deal unless there's something in it you want and are going to re-sell the rest.
---
Problem is you need an omega to anchor a bubble. That said if they're docked up it doesn't matter who puts the drag bubble down. Just wait for them to come back out.
---
Yes let's definitely improve HS to give more to the drooling retards who play there for months because their l4s and orcas are so amazing. Or tell you what, let's not do that and instead wave bye bye to people like that.
---
Well if they aren't active in your TZ, then them wardeccing you is not that big of a deal. If they are active in your TZ but they set their timers in AUTZ then hiring a merc group in AUTZ will quickly teach them the error of their ways as the HQ will die pretty much unopposed or they will need to alarm clock their whole corp/alliance to defend it each time.
---
I see this as a balancing factor. Eventually wardeccers will stick to their actual TZ if they want to shoot targets and have reasonable chance of defending their HQ.
---
I don't get it. There is this realy awesome company (Kisaki I belive) that already makes rly fucking sick EVE Shipmodels why aren't they working with them.

That's what I said, yes.
---
They exist for sure, my first corp after highsec mining also was a wormhole corp, it's just that you don't really get to experience the full wormhole experience without basic wormhole skills (ex: T2 tank and Battlecruiser with alright weapon skills for combat sites, decent scanning skills on a daily basis, Cov Ops Cloak). You can certainly do a lot on day 1 (exploration, ninja gas huffing, tackle during fleet fights), but the wormhole life is the most skill intensive area of space you can live in. You can certainly make it work with experienced corp mates, but it's really not as easy as jumping in a T1 frigate and warping to the nearest plex in lowsec.
---
would execute you with my praxis for doing that..  i had a bhaalgorn (blood raider geddon typo) that was orbitting my praxis in dehrokh.he did orbit me with no agresssion for couple  minutes,i left system to return in couple hours. found same battleship. had this time festival launcher fitted.
---
I'm guessing you were shit in the AT if you can't even fight a structure lmao
---
You can literally just drag and drop the cloak subsystem and a cloak onto any loki fit and have no changes besides -1 damage mod dumbass
---
This "expansion" is such a joke.  Yeah, they say its only stage 1, but then why are they hyping and having a stream event NOW when these things are absolutely rewardless cancer?  Sounds more like unfinished crap feature #234824802380423804.
---
Back when I was still newbie, I used to buy low in one market and move it to another where it was selling for more to make profit. I didn't know what a wardec really meant. So on one of my runs I was carrying several million isk worth of cargo in a tayra and was caught by wardeccers in Uedama.
---
Lost almost every penny I had. Made me quit my game for a long while.
---
PLEASE let them be talking to https://twitter.com/KISAKI_Studio1 - the models here are literally *EVERYTHING I COULD EVER WANT* for an EVE ship model

I don't think that will be a problem in this case, did you notice how many alliances that Corp wardec'd?
---
\#venturesinfrontofthings
---
Like everything else CCP pisses money into, it seems to have been a bust.
---
Everyone's a critic.
---
Why does CCP continue to try to drive content rather than let players drive content?  Why do they try to manufacture villains (https://youtu.be/ejX0Rym0NZw) when the game is full of them already?  They just keep doing the same thing repeatedly without finishing it. They put a little spice, try a little different flavor but forget to cook the beans all the way...every time. 
---
Why not devote your energy to making the sandbox as amazing as possible and let the players drive the content. We’re far far better at it than you.

So your actual objection isn't even 'no solo-kill noob' but rather 'stfu nullblob moron' with some gratuitous hyperbole sprinkled in. Oh and you are trying to reframe FW as equivalent to lowsec when it's not. The post is about FW, not 'neutral' lowsec. Grouping them together is as if we would talk about sov null in a npc null discussion, because both are nullsec, right? Yes, the opinion of an ex full-time and now part-time FW player should be considered in a FW discussion.
---
You're right, but it's not really about this one situation. That citadel is already waiting on its hull timer - others got to it before me.
---
I'm mostly just making a broader point about citadel timers. I think the recent war dec changes were great and well intentioned but fall short in practice due to timezone tanking and the sheer ridiculous length of citadel ref timers (they've got asset safety, a 12 day timer is just dumb).  I want people who get war dec'd to actually be able to have fun fighting back with a goal, myself included.
---
Maybe they just like that. Not all new players will like that and some will prefer to move on to other things like WH or just exploration, trading, research etc. Just because they move on to other things doesn't mean they will move on to YOUR play style. Honestly, a single high volume Jita trader will have a greater impact on the game overall than any small gang pvp corp will. All styles are important. Those mission runners put a lot of material into the game. Materials and the results of that material that I'm certain you buy. Have you ever used faction items? Thank mission runners and FW for the bulk of that. 
---
Ask EA how their "if you don't like it don't buy it" strategy went. I think your position is short sighted and a mistaken belief that it serves your personal interests. I think you will find your game withering and leaving you wondering why.
---
Wouldnt sell anywhere near enough.
---
And put a bounty on Wingspan worth 100 hours of isk.
---
I had the chance to hold 2 test prints in my hand and they looked really good with a nice weight to them.
---
i lost one too.
---
Its actually a pretty dumb looting mechanic with the wreck being as large as it is but v0v
---
And along with the 3D printed model you need a 2nd mortgage to pay for the shipping costs from their merch store.
---
Excellent post.
---
It confuses me as to why CCP haven't done anything about citadels in FW. There are two obvious quick patches - either treat them like stations for docking, or don't let them be dropped in FW space at all.
---
Goddamn even wormhole drama is boring
---
Less players but more of them actually interacting rather than deciding to live in hisec is better tbh, funnily enough I don't actually buy anything from hiseccers :)
---
What do you use?
---
All newbie centred corps are alpha friendly. Pandemic Horde, Karma Fleet, EVE University, etc.
---
Two years of clever diplomacy seem to have well served PanFam indeed
---
Maybe structures should be vulnerable during whatever time a corporation has selected as the preferred activity time for recruits to see on applications, with a minimum window to avoid? So you prefer EU players, you're vulnerable during EU hours. Prolly just end up with everyone becoming fake-AU though.
---
&gt;Citadels in their current iteration are a death knell to FW.
---
Although I agree broadly, I think another way to say this is that citadels are a death knell to FW in its previous / current iteration.  
---
Therefore, there are two main approaches to solve the problem.  One, change citadels to somehow keep it in line with the age old FW iteration / meta of the past.  Two, change FW to update it to a new iteration that works with existing citadel mechanics.  
---
Personally, I think both systems need to be updated to be in synergy with each other. FW had plenty of problems before citadels came along.  A FW system where docking access in NPC stations was the only meaningful thing for FW pilots to fight over was not a good system.  We liked it because that was what we had and we made the best of it... but it could always have been better.  
---
I'm all for potential changes to Citadels that are linked to system control.  But we should also have other meaningful objectives to fight over in FW beyond citadels or docking access.
---
&gt; Here's an idea: as much as we all loved it back then, that meta is dead, and it should stay dead.
---
I don't really agree with that. Pre-citadel FW meta was pretty good, and there's no reason it wouldn't be again. Stopping docking in hostile systems might not be the full and complete FW revamp solution, indeed, but it would surely be far better than the current position.
---
Haha, that's fair. I don't know, I guess I just feel alienated when people are talking about dealing with their children or other things. It's probably just all in my own head lets be real.

---
when they finally retire POSs I want them to reintroduce this for the last day
---
If I were the guy responsible for setting up the NPC buy orders for all the POS modules when they finally do it, I'd make you build them first because that's less work for me.
---
I'd vote to keep the POSs in until they're actually out of the game.  They're used often as staging areas, or as safe-houses in dread farming holes. 
---
Very useful to see the forcefields at minimum in d-scan profiles as you then know if a stick is online
---
Because 99% of highsec groups are strongly single timezone and super casual. It's not half as bad in nullsec now that everyone has recruited their token shit group in every timezone.
---
Never understood why when they did t-shirts and mugs they didn't contract out to maker in some of the countries to make there and get a cut. It's only what everyone else does.
---
pretty sure you could plug some peripherals into a potato and run eve on it
---
Eh, in general, if your Corp doesn't have enough people to hit a structure in a given timezone, I believe other people in this thread have pointed out the viability of merc. corps. As for the timer length, the final ref timer....actually wtf. I don't deal much with highsec. Final timers should not be longer than 7-8 days (and they aren't in wormholes). And that's assuming you hit the structure on the same day of the week that the final timer is scheduled for. Any longer is stupid and pointless.
---
Teamspeak is generally the best
---
But the people that you buy from, directly or indirect, do buy from HS. For example, Jita affects all pricing in the game. Jita pricing is the core start price and fluctuates based on location, difficulty in shipping and scarcity. No matter where you sell you have to look at the pricing and see if it's beating the cost of contracting a delivery or just going to Jita yourself instead. I would venture to say that high level Jita marketers wield more power than most alliances. 
---
All players interact with each other whether through direct contact or an indirect chain of events. that mission runner is indirectly providing a supply of faction items to your corp and/or the corp you want to fight. Those miners (in all sec spaces) are keeping the cost of warfare down and make reimbursement possible. Those space truckers are the ones making sure items are or are not available in your area. Your T2 fittings and T3 ships are entirely dependent on the researchers, manufactures, WH runners, explorers etc. PVP is just as dependent on PVE as PVE is dependent on PVP.
---
The idea you don't need them or use them is incorrect.
---
Nice joke. Take my upvote
---
Even if there were convoluted pvp requirements to do the mining, they'd just kill alts in cheap ships.  Shit is gonna be gamed so it's easy just like everything else.
---
And it's not like ccp is going to take the time to do anything complicated.
---
Well that would be good because last I checked you can't trade BPCs on the market.
---
Big on promisess. Low on delivery.
---
Yeah, it's far worse with a dedicated fleet.  With a salvager you made 30M an hour, piggybacking on the work of multiple others.  If you divide that amongst the people required to clear some of the spawns, everyone's making less isk/h than running L2 missions in a Thrasher.   Such an awesome invasion worthy of a stream event!   ...oh wait
---
CCREEE should have been honest and just said its not done yet, expansion releases in a couple more weeks.  As of now it's just a waste of time, but they're really trying to get that hype train going already.  Maybe deadlines for something....hmmmm.
---
CCP tried that, too, and still f'd up.
---
That was the most recent run, and the store was closed for a long time afterwards.
---
I was under the impression that people largely went to Florida to die, but I'll take your word for it.

---
That's... wow
---
Care to elaborate on how I could make it better please always looking to do things better.
---
That’s a fair take. I guess I spent so much time in and out of FW, from the early days of galmil atrons blotting out the sun to the last couple years of faction bs with cap support, that I find it hard to imagine any synergy between FW mechanics and citadel mechanics, or much of any way to reconcile the differences without completely gutting and rebuilding FW. 
---
I just don’t see it. 
---
As glad as I am to support a CSM candidate who has at least a moderate focus on lowsec, I’m too jaded to imagine CCP would ever iterate strongly on it or replace it in a meaningful way. I was there in person in Vegas in ‘16 when Falcon and Seagull said we’d be seeing work on FW soon^tm .
---
Yeah, but it seems theyre quite inclined to take others with them.
---
I got popped by a vendetta..

dont worry, you cant change titles of reddit posts anyway, so resubmit is the best you can do

🤣🤣🤣
---
Went to invasion, lousy circle jerk with ninja salvagers taking everyone's shit. About enough to make me say fuck this game after 12 years almost. This community has gone to shit the last few years. When it's to the point that someone takes everyone's salvage with zero consequences and all anyone says is welcome to eve, that should be a wake up call to everyone. It's time we got an honest game. Either community or developer driven before we have no game at all. When the most needed and valuable part of this new content is taken from players that work for it by players that don't, we all lose. We lose time, we lose reason to play, and we lose the part of this game that made it worth playing for so long. We really need to get this part back where it isn't every player for themself if we expect to continue growing the game instead of the current slow death we experience now.
---
Well I appreciate the insiders tip. I'll certainly have to give it a try.
---
Like I said, everyone else manages it.
---
So you have to pick from the selections they give you?
---
&gt; Do I know what I'm doing? Hell no.

Same.  Started [2009-02-23](https://xkcd.com/1179/)

It's 7o for you nerds ;-)
---
T1 is pretty easy for any decently fitted frigate with more than 200dps
---
Retribution with T3 electrical is by far the only viable solo combination I know above T2
---
Sounds bold and brash. What qualifies as a reasonably large cargo bay? Because I'm sure I have a couple cruisers still around that I could throw out into the wild in the hops of great riches. :P
---
Flycatcher is actually decent too. But yeah.

We're talkin' CCP here.

Anybody competent was also probably let-go, or not Icelandic.

Yes, you should. Most people I know have had something like this happen to them at least once. As long as you learn from failure you are doing well no matter what.
---
Did you just solve TZ tanking?
---
I think you just solved TZ tanking. Holy fuck.
---
Man highsec carebears never stop complaining. No matter how much CCP nerfs wardecs, it's never enough. Don't get me wrong, wardeccers that exclusively prey on carebears are beyond pathetic, but come on, get it together. This change gives you a completely fair way to fight back. What do you want, a button to push and just auto win? CCP could implement that and you'd be complaining that it's too hard to press.
---
How come?
---
Was Trump the moa pilot? Because it reads like him.
---
I did so. I apologize if I'm not around when you receive it, real world stuff gets in the way. XD
---
&gt; hat mission runner is indirectly providing a supply of faction items
---
Yes that is indeed where faction loot comes from.
---
&gt;those miners (in all sec spaces) are keeping the cost of warfare down and make reimbursement possible.
---
I said hisec miners, not all miners? Hisec miners have 0 involvement in my ships? 
---
&gt;Your T2 fittings and T3 ships are entirely dependent on the researchers, manufactures, WH runners, explorers etc
---
I do that myself, and anyone with 2 braincells doesn't do it in hisec. Just because you're fucking poor and fly meta fit t1 shit you bought in Jita doesn't mean we're all incapable of getting by without the very limited work done by hisec "industrialists"
---
No worries, I’ll replay when I get home
---
You seem to have had a stroke in the last bit of your sentance there, but I think you were trying to say freighters can be probed down and ganked.
---
Which is true, but absolutely irrelevant since the conversation here was about flying a draugur out like a normal person rather than couriering it like someone a little more....special.
---
I've done the usual, fallen for a 3-2-1 scam (for like 50m, I've made more back from the cheap contracts), flying loot back to Jita while under a wardec, getting blown up on lowsec stations by station gamers, forgetting that you can't jump with a weapons timer in K space, warping frigates into sites with instablap towers.
---
I've lost some shiny stuff in PVP but usually when I know it's a possibility so that doesn't really count.
---
The best one is probably doing 'warp to 0' rather than 'warp fleet to 0' while supposedly FCing a fleet. Fortunately it was a semi-friendly engagement and while I did get blapped and we lost the fight, there wasn't any long term damage.
---
You're forgetting I got downvoted for pointing it out.   Teh best
---
You mean to tell me there’s a better sniper corm pilot out there?!
---
When we’re no longer getting killed by titans, and I can’t even say ‘dropped on by a titan’ because it took the damn gate!
---
have you tried contacting a diplo for legacy?
---
well kind of, check "Halo: Forward Unto Dawn" (was a mini web serie of 5 episode before the release Halo 4), now available as a whole "movie" on Netflix and lther streaming platforms.
---
We also had "Halo: Nightfall" wich was the same stunt as "Halo: Forward Unto Dawn" but for Halo 5, but this one made it on TV.
---
But yeah I rememeber Microsoft back in 2007 with the release of Halo 3 sayin they're looking to make it as a AAA big blockbuster hollywoody movie lol (same for Mass Effect and Dead Space lol)
---
Because I love you anyways.
---
No but eve is light. My 1050 is inferior to that card and runs eve 60fps.
---
Epic salt. Well done.
---
Absolutely not.
---
In the past, you trained for a long time to get into something like a capital ship. 
---
Then after that you bought it and learned how to use that or another expensive ship. 
---
When you lose a ship like that after years of training that loss hurts more then injecting the skills and simply flying and using it.
---
And now since injectors, people just farm and sell injectors, and build entire farming groups of characters to do that. So for way more people now, things like super capitals are very much accessible and now also just another ship to have on hand docked in a keepstar. 
---
I'd say for a majority of people losing a titan or super carrier is not much of a loss now. Who cares? Sell more injectors from your character farm and rorqual alts and get another. 
---
Characters used to be more "storied" I guess, and that association went along with the feeling of loss sometimes. 
---
Now people just make a character, inject it into a super and that's that. 
---
I dont really like that and how that has changed eve.
---
this is why you do grid control for incoming DST, so that some Volta dude doesn't steal it

Maybe, [moving BPO in an inty](https://zkillboard.com/kill/72808960/), and warping gate-to-gate when I spotted a shuttle on the in-gate.  Was too late to stop warp.
---
Not my most expensive loss, but probably the dumbest.
---
During one of my drunken roams back back in the day I tried to point a Nyx with a Crow.
---
It did not end well for me.
---
Very cool thanks
---
only viable for large scale groups where theres people in every tz, small groups that are focused in one tz (there are many) will get cucked.
---
The game does not need more changes suited to the mega alliances.
---
fucking casual not being able to wake up at 4 am for eve.
---
[Hobos](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008425/kills/), [ired](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/1691647675/kills/) and [iron](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99005481/kills/) are hot garbage.

Relating themselves to doing nothing (Iron) or camping gates and krabbing (the other two) you'll find better content and more activity almost anywhere else.

My GTX1060 6gb can run it at over 140fps, though all that does is cause a ton of extra heat so I've got it locked to 60fps.

Not dead at L
---
Ii didn't forget. I'm riding the train with you in solidarity against these mental midgets.
---
Thank fuck karma isn't real and none of this matters beyond taking a shit at work eh?
---
Yep I was there to shoot at them in Geminate, was funny when they pissed off Russian Thunder Squad.
---
Tbh I was in the small group(10 dudes) and medium group now (40-50)  and issue is the exact same. Fight someone in your tz? They switch to your off tz gg
---
Oh I know but like I said I plan to make this time in Eve work which means Ill be around a long time. I was with guildsin other games that after pouring my soul into them broke up and left me with nothing in the long term. As I said I just need to get over that...
---
Eve is a *surprisingly* easy game, presented in such an abysmal way that it's *insanely* hard to learn.
---
I feel good that there's so many helpful people on here. Thanks for all the great advice. I feel even better that I'm going to stick with Eve this time (and upset I didn't try harder when I made this character in 2009!)
---
Sit down kid. 
---
I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt on where ship to ship combat happens, but you know so little about this game that even here, you get stomped by CODE.
---
Are you seriously trying to imply that there is a context where calling someone the "N-word" isn't racist? That there is some alternative meaning that OP must have not picked up on?
---
Yeah this is more flexible. I've done incursions plenty and from what I've seen a lot of groups run it with doctrines which can scare off or fully cut out newer players.
---
What's your AT rank?
---
Oh yeah. 0.
---
Casual.
---
Yeah, it's a fuckup and my biggest mistake to date. (The other was flying a Hurricane in Low Sec alone XD) It hurts to deal with, but after some time away from the incident, I don't think I feel like I want to stop playing. I just needed time to process the emotions and keep on truckin'. Thanks for the perk up, stranger.
---
Yep, they pissed off Russian Thunder Squad through pro-Nazi comments about 6mo back while they were still in Geminate, got their system camped by RTS for like a week.
---
Yes a small number of ships who forgot to hold mommy's hand and died with RMT'd shit in them = more PVP than anywhere else. I can only assume you're one of those degenerates who actually lives in hisec and isn't worth my time :)
---
In the popular 1999 Film "[The Matrix](https://youtu.be/ytftrd6rxps)", the protagonist is offered two symbolic pills, one red pill, and one blue pill. If he takes the blue pill, he goes back to sleep and never wakes from his machine-induced dream. If he takes the red pill, he becomes aware of the true nature of reality and wakes up from the matrix.
---
So 'taking the red pill' means learning the truth and 'waking up' from a belief structure.
---
Not what I was getting at, I meant that just making it so you could attack whenever ie a reverse of the current situation would be just as bad. Attackers would attack when they have no risk, reverse timezone tanking basically.
---
Timezone tanking is BS of the highest degree, its victory via technicalities. But reversing it would be just as bad.
---
I don't mind being attacked, but I do not like being attacked and being unable to respond due to EvE online not being a useful excuse to skip work [or not go to sleep so I can work].
---
I don't timezone tank my citadel, you want a fight, ok I'm game. It's EvE online I came in fully expecting to loose ships like the I'm the Russians at Tsushima.
---
Something like POS timers I think where you know how long you have to prepare as a defender but fundamentally the time is directed by the attacker would be best. Mind you I never worked with POS, Citadels came out before I thought about using POS's.
---
Really the issue is that CCP expected people to set timezones to their active times because thats when you have people on hand to defend with. Instead people just make them come out of reinforce when basically NO ONE is around.
---
If they [CCP] are still going to keep the timezone system it could perhaps be linked to some sort of bonus as well.. something that makes you want to have your citadel vulnerable when your active.
---
That way what CCP wants, and what players want are in alignment.
---
Ahahahaha, I hope you know the name of the char i used to steal it with
---
5b is nothing compared to what he put in to get that galaxy brain of his
---
Dude, we've already established you know jack about how this game actually works. Why are you still talking?
---
Shh dont share muh trade sekrits!
---
Definitely want this. Or gunpla style models.  That would be cool.
---
Man loot contesting with au ping makes me sad
---
Nope. Got plenty of decent drops.
---
What you mean when you say  human language?
---
I'm strangely more proud of some of my worse ones. Shartifartblast and bigcockrandymountain come to mind.
---
1. If I want to aim for the more economic aspects of the game, what's a good estimate on how long it'll take me to get to a point where I sustain my game-time?
---
2. I was more interested in the political side of it, good to know, thanks.
---
3. Thanks, I've been hearing a lot of negativity about the game on this sub.
---
4. What economic features does this game have? Stocks? How do corps work? Etc
---
5. That's cool!
---
6. Are EVE players open to younger newbies? As I am probably very young for someone that plays EVE...
---
Agreed. well done CCP!
---
The fortizars in solitude are multiplying out of control.
---
I stop playing... Just like everyone else but the saltiest of imachimeraforyourass'...
---
Then i log on to reddit and complain eve is dieing but never examine my own attitude and habits within the game that might be contributing to it...
---
Because i'm fucking perfect and can do no wrong when I play eve.... Because I play it *the right way*
---
/s
---
we can blame them for not coming up with a way to minimize timezone tanks. A tiny fraction of the people who time for AU timezome actually play there, they are just banking on no one who attacks them playing there either.
---
What you said was so dumb I had to squint while reading it so as to deflect some of the stupidity from entering my body.
---
I would set it as based on isk value of opposing militia ships killed, myself, plus LP earned, so if you wanna earn mining you gotta kill stuff with actual worth and run some plexes too. Everything can be gamed, but you can make it hard enough to game to not be worth it.
---
That was so much fun to watch!! Nice timing!
---
&gt;In comparison mining is engaging and ratting outright fun and we all know that neither rly is.
---
This is true and sad because when its more fun to rat then fight your enemy the game is broken.
---
This man is BSB... The rest of us have failed.
---

Indeed, I'm happy about the drastic drop in CPU demand, helps with the hardware temps a lot.

I was agreeing with you while shoe-horning in my disdain for chimeras name and baseless opinions regarding the topic.

I am still on 32 bit client. I also lost my credentials a couple times. Randomly. Then they magically came back. Then got lost again. And this happened a couple of times.

Isn't the Praxis over a kilometer long?

---
I've seen many retarded propaganda posts, but this one is the most retarded for 2019 I think.
---
Only a true EVE player would come up with that suggestion, up vote for you.
---
counter invading is a classic tactic in this game. A Horde sig just finished trying and failing to do the same thing to goons before redeploying to the north.
---
Ummm, the neut can help shed small tackle by ummm neuting out their capacitor. Kind of like a defensive scram is for ummm killing a tackles MWD before they can tackle and hold you down.
---
Barge ganking is boring target of opportunity work... suspect baiting, hauler ganking, cleaning up autopiloting trash, fw plex games is where it is. Basically anything that involves hunter and prey, tactics and knowledge, gives a sense of accomplishment.  I'm richer than Solomon, there is no point to watching a dozen vnis fly circles, rorqs sit on rocks or bosuning havens for the 500 thousandth time. There is no allure to being a f1 monkey for hours in a tidi shitfest. There is no fun to be had taking out a t1 dessy fleet with plebs bosuning every gate. Wormholes would be fun I imagine but can't be assed scanning my life away.
---
Also a term picked up by complete mongoloids who try to hide blatant sexism behind "faCtS aND LoGIc"
---
Yeah, I was at fanfest in 2014 where they said basically the same thing.  First they were gonna do null and citadels, then FW soon after.  Riiiiight.  
---
Synergy between FW and Citadels is not an easy problem to solve.  Basically everyone who's participating in the discussion on the FW Committee discord seems to recognize that citadels are the most difficult problem to address, and that is where there is the most contention.  That's why I'm so convinced that there are no easy answers, which seems to be what "just do citadel lockouts" is attempting to be, an easy answer to a super complex problem.
---
AFK moon mining enabled for the low price of killing your alt a few times a week in an insured battleship
---
wouldn't it be easier to just say "Help me understand.." instead of "Red pill me" though?
---
You might be thinking about the nerfed null sec combat anom spawn rate
---
To be fair, CCP gave it a split weapons system. Maybe they should take some of the blame
---
So civilian ABs are free now? Interesting
---
What's the excuse for bluing all those USTZ guys then
---
So whose at fault with letting him get away with it? The sub-human making those statements? Or players that continue follow them? If people continue to follow someone like that, regardless of perceived benefit, they are just as guilty for sticking around.
---
If it were me, that conversation would have ended at the first use of the word and I would have begun moving my shit out.
---
👍🏻 Neat, why are you telling us this?
---
If you have no interest in competing with others than this isn't the game for you. It's meant to be competitive. Ninja salvaging is fun. Interacting with players is fun. It's all fun if you're game for it, but you're not into it so don't play its that simple.
---
fucking a that was awesome to watch!

Great vid.

This makes me moist 💦
---
Particularly thanks for no perceivable increase in resource usage per client (and some even report improvement).
---
Inb4 we turn 3D eve ships into a table top game like Warhammer 40k
---
People complained mightily about lots of issues in the pre-Citadel FW meta, almost none of which have been addressed even now.  Citadels just became the most obvious whipping boy for all complaints about the decline of FW. But there were fundamental problems even then like risk averse gameplay, manipulation of the warzone by farmers, LP market imbalances, and lack of opportunity for FW groups to support higher level content to compete with large pirate organizations.
---
Citadel lockouts aren't going to just magically return things to the way it was before.  EVE has fundamentally changed over the last several years, and the ease and convenience for players of operating out of citadels is a big part of that. If players are locked out of citadels at this point, it will drive out more players from FW than it brings in by appealing to old timers like me who actually remember what FW was like back in the day.
---
Yeah I know I am still training the covert OP cloak myself
---
&gt; you know jack about how this game actually works.
---
This from the man who unironically believes RMT fuckups last year mean hisec is the big PVP place :joy:
---
Indeed, I made over 2b in highsec from 3-4/10s, unrated, and faction spawns in 2 weeks back in February playing for 2-5hr/day.
---
If players would drive content then CCP wouldn't need to. Right now it's all AFK Mining/Ratting. Where's the content in that?  Not to mention you can't have a 100% totally PvP game unless you want something like a MOBA. There has to be PvE content developed.
---
If you have evidence of this, please send to vargus crosix. I would be interested in that.
---
why are tackle in neut range just kite lmao
---
Building the largest megablob in the game's history is only clever if you want to win the game more than you want to enjoy playing it.
---
There’s also /r/buildapcforme with a lot of very helpful nerds who j/o to pcpartspicker
---
I assumed he was working through the NPE, in which they blah, blah, blah here's your afterburner blah blah blah, now go do x.
---
I tend to nod off while their blahing, so i only hear the go do x part.  I'd forget to fit the afterburner.  I think I actually did that on one new toon.
---
workstation cards for gaming is generally trash.
---
They "recruit", basically spam invites to people in the in game help channels as well.

Id settle with bug fixes

Dipping my toes back into Eve after many years away and I still remember corp mining ops in battleships.

In the next graph, they show exactly the same thing, but taking The Forge out because with it in, you can't actually see the differences.
---
Why is that? Because The Forge has more economic value than the rest of EVE combined to such an extent that it is not even on the same scale.
---
And lol at thinking the *Loot Fairy* is an RMT device. Are you stuck in 2007 or something?
---
Good lord kid, just take the L.

Or don't. I do like salt.

Sadly.

It was random money! Didn't want those 500bil anyway! (c)
---
Dumbest thing I ever did was back when I was first getting into ratting in wormholes. I was already comfortable with the content - I knew how to probe scan, dscan, set up a safe, follow Rykki's guides, etc and it was starting to become natural - but I was still fairly inexperienced. So, I'm in a passive drake and I jump into a c2 that was one or two jumps away from Bourynes - one of the newbro starting points for Gallente. The wormhole I jumped into was actually decently active with newbro-type stuff (velator, imicus, poor probes, etc.), but there were plenty of anoms, so what the hell why not? I get set up, start running an anom when suddenly combat probes show up on dscan. And I actually thought, "wow, these noobs are dumb! They don't realize that combat probes are worse for scanning down sigs than regular probes!"
---
Yeah, those were not noobs. Rip drake. And pod. With +4s.

its fascinating, spin people up just the right way, then tell them 1+1 = 2 and youll get downvoted.  
---
theyre full on "SQUIRREL!" brain.

Looks like that has very similar performance to a 1050 which should mean it runs fine at 60hz at 1080. Unless you’re in a 10% tidi fight with hundreds of Titans on grid.
---
TIL the Mittanni harassing a guy for suggesting Goons report bots to CCP is "just propaganda".

maybe you lort interest on eve but for me  is a challenge every day   and love my corp mates  the friends i do here  so  is not up to  the game is up to you  what you want to be

for me is incredible hard to just be online on eve and you just gave up in 3 months lol   is sadly when  saw this

well enjoy it    cause i am having fun and learning more every day  hope you too one day

China time is very close to AUTZ, close enough that I think it will be considered the same if Mango really gets established.
---
3D concrete models confirmed?
---
wide*
---
&gt; Why is that? Because The Forge has more economic value than the rest of EVE combined to such an extent that it is not even on the same scale.
---
Jita is a tradehub. That's 1 system where a lot of items are sold across all of hisec, all the other "hubs" are worse than NC. Hisec is irrelevant for loot, irrelevant for any real research and manufacturing, and irrelevant for pvp.
---
&gt;And lol at thinking the Loot Fairy is an RMT device
---
Much of the ISK destroyed in the Forge is RMT shuttles full of injectors, I'm sorry if you can't see that.
---
&gt;Are you stuck in -year-
---
You... you tried to prove your "point" with an MER from april LAST year... how fucking retarded are you?
---
&gt;Good lord kid, just take the L.
---
Oh not retarded, just 12 years old. Ok, bye.
---
You sound like a very closed-minded individual.
---
the key point is, you will need players willing to accept the downsides of not blueing everyone.
---
your the one who cant kill my astrhus lol
---
For sure. I completely agree. Citadel proliferation is a major issue and locking people out of their own structures is not a fix. People were never locked out of their own POS shields when systems got flipped. 
---
Personally I believe there should be a hard cap on how many structures there can be in any given system or constellation in non-sov k-space. That by no means is a solution but I believe it’s a necessary early step.
---
No one blames TAPI for not invading goons.  They blame them for being on the same side of anything of consequence when they really don't need each other, while still pretending not to be allies.  Horde and GOTG were bluetrals through the whole of Horde's Fade/PB days, but we didn't deny we were allies and didn't contain the literal majority of nullsec between us.  That's the difference.

it's only natural. Think about the real world. There are no real independent groups. You could say 'switzerland'. But Switzerland isn't out for PVP. An indepdenent null alliance would be :)

I'm confused. This has nothing to do with the game client but you're here typing that as if there was a relation between them.
---
Well I guess each to their own, but I prefer the challenge of fighting against other combat pilots. Picking on dumb nerds in highsec is a funny meme but it's hardly more 'relevant' in terms of the Eve universe than nullsec...
---
You realize that industrial pursuits make up 75% of the game, right? Meanwhile EvE's PvP honestly sucks. You can trap someone and shoot them, or fly in circles too fast for them to hit. After about five minutes, it's boring as hell
---
I enjoy the fact that the Linux launcher doesn't have 64-bit support.

thanks!
---
content citadels is a classic tactic in this game. A TEST sig just finished trying and failing to do the same thing to Fraternity before Vily declared the war was starting over. 
---
I'm sorry this conversation is absurd. Here's what it comes down to - when your enemies lose ships, you gloat. When you and your allies lose ships, it's strategic. When your allies lose the strategic objective but win the isk war, it's strategic. When your enemies do the same, you gloat. It's base political hypocrisy in a goddamn videogame and it's ridiculous. A fortizar is under 10bn isk. They take 15 minutes to anchor. I'm sure frt would have loved if it onlined, but if you told them that they could trade a fort for a hundred+ bil in kills they would do it every goddamn day. Honestly. This "lol my losses don't matter only yours do" bullshit is pants-on-head stupid.
---
No. Pick whoever you want.

I speak Russian (was born in the USSR) but live in US. And I still only understand half of what most Russian EVE players say because it's mostly some EVE Russian slang which I'm not familiar with because it's not really Russian and I play the game in English and speak to everyone in English. It's like some version of russified english names of things. Sometimes I understand them sometimes I don't.

Like they call Machariels, Machalkas in Russian, which is a Russian word for a washcloth. Took me a while to figure that one out.

You don't go fast enough to kite everything. You can still be caught by a number of things in a 100MN T3C. The neut isn't a bad idea if you do get caught by small tackle. Your suggestion that it is completely pointless is just wrong.

If only you had some sort of 3rd party person to guarantee high value/high risk transactions....
---
I was trying to find a term that didn't sound elitist, or derogatory - but you know what I mean... There is a minority of Eve players who undock with the intent of fighting other players... Those are the people I wanna fight, not the hapless indi guys, or the turbo krabs, or the guys who've only ever shot at red triangles... Those people you shoot to draw out the fights... This is how nullsec works if you're a pvper... What you describe is like all of the work with none of the payoff...

Heard this before.
---
I think that’s his point. OP mentioned peoples complaints about credentials alongside his praise for the new client.
---
This dude is illustrating how they’re unrelated.
---
I mean that’s not the players fault though. CCP needs to adjust the mechanics to encourage players to fight. That’s the whole point of my “make the sandbox awesome” comment. Citadels, fozzie sov, rorq mining and super umbrellas actively discourage players to fight each other by making it unrewarding or too difficult. PVE content is critical to the game but right now there’s a very lopsided focus and it’s hurting everyone.
---
Those are medium citadels. Just wait till we actually get smalls. You think you seen citadel spam already, well hold my planetary production and watch this.
---
They should just increase the vulnerable hours count by a factor of 50% or more.
---
add some small rebar bits for minmitar models
---
Your username reminded me of DBPreacher.  Whatever happened to that guy?
---
Common mistake, It's spelled M-U-M-B-L-E
---
you could require some person doing something while its vulnerable
---
like manually keeping the shields up or something. miss 3 weeks in a row? bye citadel.
---
would also lower the fucking structure spam
---
It's great, but only for highsec wars. Doesn't do anything for null/j-space unfortunately. 
---
Still, I'd love to have this.
---
you pay irl money for them.
---
like, you're going to have to be a tad more specific with your question.
---
short version is, despite how moronic some people are that will try to claim it, this game isn't pay to win - BUT, it is a subscription game so don't expect to be able to compete with subscribers when using a trial account.
---
You can buy two things with real money in eve, game time (via Plex) or cosmetic items. Overall CCP has done a good job of monetizing the game while staying away from p2w mechanics.
---
Edit: the cosmetic items are purchased with Plex so really you can only buy Plex with real money. It’s up to you what you do with it.
---
A defender needing to hire a AUTZ merc corp to end a war is still shitty gameplay. 
---
The AUTZ merc corp is still not going to get a fight, they just get paid to shoot structures.
---
In 2014 I saw an officer module was selling in Jita for 1 Bil.  There was a buy order for the exact same item for $3.5 Bil.
---
Two things happened that day. 
---
1) I bought that module for $1 Bil ISK.
---
2) I learned about the margin trading scam.
---
has anyone had an issue with the U.I scaling being too big? I selected the checkbox on and off both no difference,
---
changed the U.I scaling ingame but everything still seems huge..?
---
What micro transactions? You can play as an alpha just fine and never spend any money. You can pay for omega and do everything. 
---
If by micro transactions your talking about buying MPTCs or plex or cosmetics or something, none of that is necessary.
---
So the idea that that’s holding you back is in no way valid. Sure maybe you won’t have everything you want as fast as you want. But the game can be played enjoyably in a frigate from day 1. Solo frigate PvP is legitimately fun. And you can join a ton of groups as a low level alpha. 
---
Literally no money required. I pay for omega because I want to support the game and fly all the ships. But if I didn’t have the money I would still play and still have fun.
---
Damm nice Kronos though.
---
Because somewhere, someone is going to buy a 3-d printed Epithal.
---
Never heard of him, sorry
---
Yep.   Me too
---
What do you consider a "microtransaction".  The game is free to play (Alpha account) and in the beginning that doesn't mean you start off much behind a subscribed (Omega/paying) player.  There is a limit to how far you can skill as an "Alpha" but you won't notice that in the beginning.  Also, you skill at half the pace, but that too you won't notice right away.
---
EvE is not pay-to-win in that paying will only boost the speed with which you will expand your options of what you can do in game, but it won't make you better at the game.  This is a game where skill and knowledge still triumphs over the character that paid real $ to bling themselves.
---
If you're in SAI with me right now, are you still saying that ? :P because 11% is meh
---
Microtransactions? You can buy ANYTHING in this game with real money. Ships, modules, skill points, even characters for your accounts. So if you have money, you can instantly get to a veterans level in terms of 'gear'. Of course, you still need to learn the game. But as far as microtransactions goes, this game is built on top of them. That's how it survives. Otherwise it would have died a long time ago cause CCP would be poor.
---
Aggressor HQ needs to be a structure in highsec as per patch notes.
---
Yes, I do believe you are wardec eligible.
---
Structures that count for war eligibility are:
---
* All Upwell Structures (including Upwell FLEX structures)
---
* Starbase Control Towers
---
* Player-owned Customs Offices
---
* Sovereignty Structures (Infrastructure Hubs and Territorial Control Units)
---
If at least one corporation within an alliance owns a structure in space, their war eligibility extends to the whole alliance.
---

---
To expand on what he said,  you will in fact be able as an Alpha to beat lesser skilled/knowledge subscribers.  But they will have advantages not open to you until you subscribe (and skill up).  So that will up the bar on how good you will need to be.  
---
But a lot of this game, and almost all of the different aspects of game play will be open to you to sample as a free-to-play character, and you can subscribe that character at any time and gain those benefits.
---
Umm no, it's a disparaging term used to refer to people who avoid pvp at all costs. It's not specific to eve either. It's not an objective label or a term of endearment. It's like the n word, you may try and reclaim it but that doesn't change how it started and people don't have to accept your new meaning for it.
---
In eve there simply isn't a term for a pve focused player because of the diversity of what that could mean they are doing. And as for krab and krabbing i don't speak russian so i'm not super familiar with its origins, as such i prefer not to use it. Preferring instead to refer directly to what i'm doing (ex, ratting, explo, trading, mining.)
---

Do you want finished product or the model pieces?

PLEX = Game time credits that can also be sold in-game to other players for in-game money with which you can buy in-game things (ships, ammo, etc. etc.)
---
You also can just pay for game time to the gaming company, which is cheaper per game time than the same game-time equivalent of  PLEX would cost.

fantastic, lets just get them ***unpainted*** so they're cheap for us and don't cost so much capital for ccp that they shut it down shortly thereafter. now just wondering about size choices.
---
OP can you explain what you mean by being held back? Maybe we can help.
---
That is a really REALLY bad way to describe it.
---
You can't buy anything with real money but cosmetics, game-time credits (PLEX) or injectors (an in-game item for exchanging skill points).  But once you buy those things you can then sell them to other players in-game for in-game money (called ISK) and you can use ISK to buy whatever is in-game that you want.
---
There is a very sophisticated market system and there are trade hubs where these exchanges all take place.
---
EVE isn't a particularly intensive game, and can be run on basically a potato at the low end. That being said veteran players who run multiple accounts at once will want a stronger machine. [Specs for reference](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/eve-online/10523).
---
I'm sure I am not the only one using the combat AI for this purpose.
---
I was probably not in your fleet as I have only done this with 4-5 guys from my corp
---
So.... you're mad that someone ninja salvaged your stuf after playing for..... 12 years? Have you been living under a rock or something?
---
Another update to this...  you can buy PLEX in-game from other players who are selling it.  But it is quite expensive, escpecially in relation to what you will be able to earn as a new player.  Don't try to subscribe your account by earning the amount needed in game to buy game time.  That is not fun.
---
Well, your targeting icons are in the top right, your HUD is on the bottom and you have a massive overview that takes up space for no real reason. That means your mouse has to travel top right to bottom all the damn time and it's difficult to keep an eye on it all.
---
If you move the targeting icons closer to your HUD you decrease the amount of mouse travel needed meaning you waste less time and make it just easier to use, especially in a hectic situation like a difficult PVP fight. So that already helps. I'm not sure if you use the selected item window much, it's personal preference after all, but if you do you also move that one close to the HUD and to the right side of the screen.
---
Then you make the overview less bulky as there's really no reason to have many of the columns as wide as they are and you make it less tall which still works fine, especially if you use decent overview filters. That gives you room to move the Dscan window above the overview on the right. That means that all the important information is in the right quadrants of the screen and THAT means you can very easily and quickly glance at it all. Fleet fights might require more overview space and less or no Dscan space but that's easily changed, for solo PVP you don't need that much real estate for it.
---
It's just more ergonomic if you can access all important info at a single glance of the screen and you don't need to move your mouse so much. After you're used to it will improve your game play as you waste less time and effort on the UI.
---
Here's an example. Bear in mind that this is a combat exploration PVE setup so the overview here is tiny and limited, also there's no detached Local window on the left. And because I chat a lot in Rookie that window is massive so really just ignore the left side of the UI and adapt it to a more PVP focused environment. Also I DO actively make use of the selected items window so it's crammed in there, as said: personal preference.
---

I'm not saying "copy what I do" because that's a bit silly as everyone is different and does different things. What I AM saying is that you can improve your performance if you put some thought into your UI setup.
---
Can we make this work for nullsec too, pls?
---
Like maybe if structures anchored in enemy sov have the same vulnerability timer of the system owner's sov? System indexes are inversely proportional effects to enemy structure vulnerablity timers as well. 
---
Make TCUs matter again/more.
---
Assaulting an alliance actually active in another TZ will be difficult. But dropping citadels in enemy space will be easy if they set your vulnerability timers to thier own TZ tank, and then get thier indexes crushed by your active presence there. 
---
The stronger and more active alliance in thier chosen TZ will have a timer and ADM advantage.
---
I agree, but as I said I think it will balance itself out once wardeccers realize that setting timers in off peak hours is not going to work.
---
Right now I'm trying very hard to order a print of 215 mm long Nidhoggur(already ordered a small fleet of other ships though), but because the only available model has a lot of very thin walls and details and I am a complete zero at 3D modeling, it goes very slowly(and painfully). Please, if you will make Nidhoggur model available for ordering and with shipping to Russia, I will order two.

But for now I will continue seeking help redacting that model. Why is that outer armor is so hard to change qq

It will still work, because not every noobie highsec corp can afford to stay up late or hire an autz merc corp. And instead of getting to fight back against the agressors, they have to pay money or find a way to login at 4am on a work night. 
---
As shown in the OP, Most of the corps this is intended to protect would happily fight back themselves, given the chance. 
---
So instead, it just means more picking on the little guys, which is the whole point of the change.
---
 Players complained about the way the game was before all of those changes went in to effect and they're complaining about them now afterwards. 
---
Players are going to continue to exploit the game mechanics to the best of their ability to gain an edge no matter what the change is, path of least resistance kind of thing. One of Eve's biggest problems is players have learned to weaponize boredom. If they can make it not fun to fight them, then players will move on and find a more entertaining activity. The sad fact is that  more than a healthy amount of players are willing to subject themselves to shear, mind-numbing boredom to win. That's why the great joke about Eve is that you play another game while waiting for something to happen in Eve. Until that player mindset changes, you won't see any positive change to the game.

I'd recommend joining one of the giant alliances first, Dreddit/TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet/Goons.  Use them to get your bearings and learn the basics about the game and fleet combat.

Well not everybody has the huge amount of SP you must have to max out your planetary interaction, scanning and exploration, research, refining, manufacturing and all the other associated skills to be making their own T2 and T3 supply chains. Plus you must be blessed with incredible amounts of time available to do all that WH, NS and low sec mining, anoms and exploration. On top of which I'm sure your personal logistics chain needed to move and utilize all that material must be the envy of many. I'm not sure how you manage to also squeeze in the events for the limited run BPCs too. However, if you are doing all that, when are you doing PVP?

As a point of interest, I must point out that a good amount of materials and more (ships, modules) are sold and transported to null sec. Many people run alts specifically for this purpose.

So, in other words, they hit a deadline and had to release the content early, they'll maybe tweak some content over the next 2-3 months and then just abandon the feature altogether, adding it to the pile of unfinished features in EVE.

No real PI is done in hisec, the amount you get is awful. All other space is far better for it and anyone claiming hisec is a big PI supply doesn't know what they're talking about.
---
&gt;scanning and exploration
---
Hisec has very, very few worthwhile sites, and those few are rare spawns. Much of explo loot is from wh/null sites.
---
&gt;research, refining, manufacturing
---
Yeah anyone doing that in hisec has mental issues.
---
&gt; Plus you must be blessed with incredible amounts of time available to do all that WH, NS and low sec mining, anoms and exploration
---
Hisec mining is the most pointless thing in the game, as it has no special rocks and no realistically worthwhile ones. Lowsec isn't much better. The hisec anoms are fucking shite for faction loot, IDK what you've been smoking and again hisec explo isn't worth it.
---
&gt;in the events for the limited run BPCs too
---
You... you do know events don't only happen in hisec, right?
---
Fire up your faxes boys
---
&gt;But as far as microtransactions goes, this game is built on top of them.
---
Can you tell me which part of the game is built on top of microtransactions?
---
That is acceptable as long as you are repping this guy. Make it LAST!
---
I hate this lie. Alphas do not get a full experience.

So sorry to hear about Paola. You probably wont remember me but I was the goon that sent over some Spotify premium codes for Paola back in May 2014.  Anyway, I’m glad to hear you are on the right path. I don’t play much games these days but if you ever need to blow off some steam or just someone to have a chat with then hit me up. Take care brother.
---
Reps for him, and just feed him bling marauders all night.
---
thats cheating
---
Dumbest thing ... hmmm ... trusted "The Judge".  That was a mistake
---
You do however have waaaay better ping then those XIX russian nerds.
---
3GB is excellent. Even more so considering you are in a large fight.
---
Yeah I felt good about it at the time because those ships were not practical for anything other than station spinning, then I found out one recently sold for 180B+
---
Shamis was pissed I sold it, think the next year we only gave out 5 Adrestia?  Oops.
---
You are either confused or a troll.  Prior posting history does not smell like troll so help us to help with your question.
---
Eve does not have micro transactions.  The monthly sub fees might be macro transactions but as others have said there is a free to play way.
---
Which makes me think you are talking about spending ISK not actual RL money.  Example you have 10,000 isk but the tutorials are asking you to spend 1,000 isk for a module?  Isk is the in game money you earn/make and spend to get things.  The more you progress in skills the more isk you make to them buy more things.  It’s not like some of the games that give you say 50 free diamonds and you need to pay cash to get more diamonds later to do anything.
---
If you are new to the game do the tutorials and career agent tutorials and you get ships and skills and other free things and isk.  Also look on your screen for the rookie chat window.  It’s a place where no question is stupid and full of folks learning.  Or state your question/problem here with more detail and you will get help.  Fly safe o7
---
I think it's kind of ironic
---
Some of the alliances that used to follow around weaker alliances is now starting to feel what that's like. I hope it motivates them to be better
---
Try using a supported OS.

Can someone speed me up on what’s going on with all of this?
---
Thank you for the explanation man does help il have a look at my ui setup and try improve apon it I do see where you come from for sure less mouse movement  will be better and what not.

I realize HS PI is not profitable but to claim you do all your own stuff (if I understood you correctly) would mean having to do PI no matter where you were. The same is true for for everything else I mentioned. No matter where it's done, you still have to do it. Plus, if there was no profit for doing stuff in HS then nobody would be doing it, but they do. I wonder where that profit might come from? I'm thinking it comes from all regions. People also do business in non-HS regions because they have found profit there too. 
---
Moon mining in HS is pretty okay. I liked it.
---
I'm fully aware that events don't just happen in HS. My point is that you still have to do them if you are going to be self sufficient as it seems you are claiming. 
---
My other point is that if you buy ANYTHING in EVE, I guarantee you have purchased items manufactured/gathered and/or shipped from HS at some point. That doesn't mean every item, but they are in there because resellers and manufacturers will buy from any source that will bring a profit. That includes contracting from HS.
---
I know this first hand since I have actually run a contract load into null. Only once, since I didn't look for another one. It was kind of fun tbh.
---
Honestly looking forward to when that happens, hopefully going be some good content.
---
Edit: Lol immediately downvoted for being excited about something. My feelings &lt;/3
---
What are we supposed to feel? Happiness that our purpose isn't tied to structures or a specific region in space?
---
You can't do this in nullsec because the ease of power projection of the large alliances (i.e. the ease of moving capital ships around) means you either join the donut or get crushed by one of its members.
---
I will contract you some purple to put on that for your cause.
---
Carebear is simply not always used as an insult. Sorry if you don't like that answer but it's a fact. Obviously you can feel offended by whatever you like but it doesn't mean things will have to or even need to change to suit your personal tastes. Your choosing to be offended by a common term is just that. Your choice. frankly that just makes it a "you" problem and thus a non-issue.
---
Don’t you go making me clear shelf space!
---
i always think about it, but never actually do it, i hope that i will make at least a few more, either way, brilliant video none the less :)
---
I'd settle for a a self destruct button with a 1 hour countdown timer on all structures. What a waste of time! - The alternative, 7 days to wait for it to unanchor? That's just stupid. It's more convenient to just leave the damn things floating without fuel and modules and move on with your life.

Not a full experience. I said there are things they can’t do. But that doesn’t mean it’s not still a fun game as an alpha. For someone with no job or no money then alpha is a way to play. Of course you get more experience as a full customer rather than the free sample. But it’s a fun sample that can be played indefinitely

---
PI doesn't make HS relevant. I do not live in HS so I'm not entirely sure why you bring up HS. Moon mining in HS is actual shit when you look at pretty much any option in real space. Nothing you listed gives any relevance to hisec, just the same as your April 2018 MER doesn't really mean shit. Go back to official forums where the other retards post.

---
The 1060 alone is worth that much.  Seems too good to be true.
---
This is a lot like the PC I just replaced.  It will run EVE fine. You can build a *much better* PC for about $1200.  
---
If I had to guess, I'd ballpark this one at around $350, with a solid chunk of that in the 1060. I could be off.

I think they could just buy a dildo and get the job done.

Proposal for dealing with Citadels in FW\*:
---
The faction that owns the iHub bashes any citadel that isn't owned by a corp in their militia.  They bring a cap fleet to shoot at it, vaguely like an inverse to the NPC Sotiyos (but will need a different reinforcement spawn mechanic)
---
Players can speed it up by helping bash or gain LP by shooting at the NPC fleet.
---
Eliminates Citadel spam and provides incentive to keep that iHub.  Can't avoid the bash via a neutral corp, since neutral corps are not in the militia.  Also provides a transition mechanism, since it appears CCP didn't think about FW when designing Citadels.  CCP could add some other tweaks later and use the NPC bashes to enact those tweaks.
---
\*Disclaimer: Haven't done FW, idea might be horrible.
---
Wait. YOU were the one that claimed it was a derogatory term and you found it offensive. You stated so in several posts.  ???????
---
CAN DO! And remember the next time you go shopping, look for the High Sec label as a a guarantee of quality! =)
---
It had a cloak, but you can’t cloak in highsec with -5.0. Quafe Zero gives 5% bonus to scan res and velocity, but no buff to agility, so though my ship went faster, it didn’t align faster. That meant the insta-lock camp nabbed me 3 jumps from Jita.
---
I have been having a lot more disconnects recently, also the hacking window seems to lag very badly compared to when I played a few months back. Not sure if it's the client or my Internet connection though.
---
Well, I personally didn't trust him specifically.  Didn't even know about him.
---
My mistake was following orders, and moving all my assets into the keepstar.
---
The biggest loss for me was the community of really great people.  I've not had as much fun in Eve since.
---
Maybe you should go back and reread what i posted. Because i never once claimed i was offended or that it was offensive. I claimed that it was disparaging and derogatory (read insult.)
---
Yes, transferring territory to Darkness is certainly a blow to botters.
---
If it is that important to you, then get your sorry ass out of bed, and fight. Lots of people do just that.
---
Sure, but like ping is not gonna save me from the UK bois, and I still beat em ;)
---
You compared it to using the "n" word.

It's okay if you didn't realize it could be used in a variety of ways, but don't just pretend that makes it somebody else's fault.

I'm sorry for your loss and proud of you for putting together something in her memory.

It's also been pretty good for me too.  I don't have unrealistic expectations that it'll be a magic cure for 4k 0.0001% TIDI fleet fights but you never know.

because this is an extremely expensive way to make in bulk

I saw your initial video back when you posted it, hope it all gets better for you dude.

look for the High Sec label as a a guarantee of ~~quality!~~ retarded krabs who think their space matters =)

Look. The game is designed around the idea that all space matters and all space is interconnected. That's how they intended it to be. Just relax and enjoy. To quote Everybody Loves Raymond", "The monkey doesn't care where the food pellet comes from. He just enjoys the pellet". Sage words. Just relax and enjoy the game. it doesn't matter who makes your stuff or the stuff your corp mates use. Just enjoy the stuff and get on with the game.

an actively balanced and changed game, nerfing of citadels and adding a stront timer to it, the removal of local

would all reinvigorate the game

To be fair, high sec dwellers don't care about you either. Just saying. WH dwellers like being left to their own space and LS suffers endlessly. FW was crushed under farming mechanics. The list goes on. Everywhere has their issues. Still, you keep logging in, right?

Considering it has worse resists than a decently rolled t2 dcu with unstable, i doubt it's that much
---
So they are just like some normal politician? Welcome to real life.
---
Hisec dwellers care simply about the 5m/week they make and how incredible they believe it is. Hisec nobody should play in, LS especially FW is fucked because internet comedians can't fight subcaps in subcaps, nullsec is 90% blobs, wormholes basically the only space worth being in and CCP forget it exists.

Glassing is a reference to the phenomenon of fusing minerals in the earth into a [glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitite) that occurs after some nuclear weapons are used. The earth under the blast can literally be turned to glass.

The use of it respective to the halo series is the same, just with respect to the use of alien weaponry to the same effect. You're essentially attributing the term "nuke" to CNC Red Alert.

If you return, do yourself a favor and check out NPSI groups like spectre fleet and bombers bar.   Join the game, blow some ships up, dock up. No politics just explosions.

&gt;If they see the hunter come in, they're going to dock up anyway?

and then they see the hunter leave so they can either:

1) assume someone is in system, and never undock ever again
---
2) rat, and potentially die
---
stop being so aggressive, if you don't realize this you're literally not worth speaking to

removing local effectively fixes you knowing exactly who and what is in system with you

*narrator voice*
---
Everyone showed up in a cap.
---
Or you could leave local as it is because nullsec isn't wormholes? I'm really not seeing why you're so afraid of either shooting something that's also looking for PVP or hunting in a wormhole. If they dock up when you come in, they're getting absolutely nothing, that's the tradeoff for their safety, end of, if you want to bitch more take it to official forums where anyone will care.

Voting for Olmeca Gold and that's pretty much it. I know nothing of the other people running whatsoever. Xenuria is and always has been a cringelord. The rest should've done a better job of putting themselves out there with entertaining shit for me to mindlessly consume. Olmeca had a dope ass video with a clear and agreeable message appended to it. None of these other slackers have anything of the sort. I also have zero desire to vote for any of the bloc candidates because fuck'em, they don't need my vote. They have their zombie hoards to do that for them.

You really are an idiot...

seems like it, now i hope they actually do something bc they are so far just a pushover and a bunch of HS crabs in cruisers crush em

Eh?  Running the 64bit client on Ubuntu myself.
---
Wait. So I was actually right? I know that took me a while to come to that conclusion, but I never claimed to put the "smart" in "smart-ass".
---
The issue is we didn't used to be this toxic by and large. Over the years welcome to eve has been used to justify the fact the community as a whole has a case of asshole millennial syndrome. This needs to stop to retain and grow the game. Continuing current behavior only perpetuates bad behavior that turns players off coming into the game.
---
I can't argue with your post. However, I would like to see a way for pilots to be able to profit from their destruction, not the famed "ban-hammer". You can ban them after we get everything they have. :-)
---
Side-Note - The ban-hammer gets used way too often for too many things in a knee-jerk reaction. It's time investigating and evidence was involved before using it. I'm still upset with CCP after the Brisc Rubal event. They really looked like idiots for that undeserved ban.

Have any regular Abyssal (T4/T5) runners noticed drones popping like flies since the Invasion release?
---
I'm not talking about the drop in Gila drone HP role bonus from a while back, or using T1/T2 faceroll drones, under-skilled drone durability, or losing focus on a [damage]grip tessera spawns.
---
I'm talking about Faction drones going from bricks tanking everything BUT Tessera/specific T4 rooms (even after the 250% Gila role drop) to basically turning into 35M popcorn kernels in every room since Invasion release?
---
If this is intentional - no worries - I'll adapt. That's what we pilots have to do... IF intentional. But this seems too stark a contrast compared to pre-release game play (with no release notes on it I've found) to feel intentional.
---
So... am I nutso, or have others noticed the issue as well or know the intention?
---
I think he meant both. My bad if he didn't.
---
I’ll try to help, what do you want to know?
---
I do high sec combat exploration, cosmic sigs, and have been doing that for years. It pays 400-800 mil a day on average, just like it did before.
---
Will do, appreciate it!
---
if the goal is to require people to be around during their own vuln time, then it would have to drain all fuel. otherwise they could just fuel it the next day. then all it would accomplish is making them more expensive to run.
---
youd need some new mechanic to force people to put the vuln during their timezones
---
Through Steam? That's how I had to get it to work. The option to run the 64-bit client wasn't on the Linux client when I tried it last.
---
I’ve heard of olmeca gold. What’s his platform?
---
Tooling the molds usually costs tens of thousands of dollars. Most model kits have several sprues. Often time modle makers will take shortcuts and try to utilize the same sprues on several kits to help reduce the costs. So the cost for 1 kit typically starts at around 50k and it's quite a while before you would see a return.
---
ah, so we've now conceded the point that removing local actually DOES something, so we've moved back to 
---
&gt;Or you could leave local as it is because nullsec isn't wormholes?
---
because wormholes suck, and i want nullsec to have a healthy pvpve environment, because local is inherently unhealthy as a player can avoid ALL pvp interaction if he wishes.
---
Think it's just a few people, no issues here.
---
They see you in local, they dock up, you're now fucking their day. You the player are fucking something up for another player. There's your PVP now go cry to someone else about how one type of space doesn't share the unique mechanic of another

Ehhhhh having played Aus timezone for 5ish years or so I wouldn't call it content it was repping pos's or bashing them or dropping a handfull for carriers a thousand or so ks off a citadel with subcap support next door. No opposition or blueballs and no in between.
---
&gt;when it's to the point that someone takes everyone's salvage with zero consequences 
---
Then give them consequences. Nothing is stopping you from killng the salvagers. If you kill them sure you die and have to reship but so do they and they drop the loot. If you can beat them back for it then it's yours. If you can't odds are someone else took it and they lost it. Don't whine that it's someone else's job to punish them, grab your ballsack, man up, and punch them in the face. Or cower in the dark corner of reddit and keep praying a unicorn will come save you.
---
Last time I checked there was an unofficial official launcher made by a dev. Doesn't use Steam.
---
&gt; They see you in local, they dock up, you're now fucking their day.

so we have a stare off of doing nothing- this is objectively bad for the game

if you can't realize this, you need to use ur brain

Or severely reduce them to make it less attractive to Bots. Sad, but this might be the only way.

Yes

Hey have commented on this. With the recent release they are now using mainstream wine release which lacks the changes they used to Mac. Previously they rebound cmd to opt to emulate PC. It has been fairly easy to adapt (cmd-p vs opt-p for probes etc). For copying and pasting you will need to use CTRL-c and CTRL-v inside game, and cmd-c/cmd-v out of game.
---
&gt; so we have a stare off of doing nothing- this is objectively bad for the game
---
You're disrupting their content. Again, if you want space-specific mechanics, you need to *go to the space that provides them.*

&gt;It's much healthier to have people dying, and people trying to stop people from dying

Who in the actual fuck is going to try to save a VNI?

&gt;You're disrupting their content. Again, if you want space-specific mechanics, you need to go to the space that provides them.
---
true, but my entire argument is i think that should be moved to nullsec, so you keeping on about it over over is pointless.
---
Lol where do you live bro? Haha maybe I could be in a system near you!
---
Wow, I heard there might be issues with multi boxers but if you of all people say it’s good, I’m going to opt in!
---
Anyone not named that PIRAT tard.
---
Unspoken are great people. Never been apart of them, but have fought them and was always impressed with them. It's unfortunate that they finally got blobbed out of ER.
---
"Mildly aligned" meaning that GSF and Unspoken had common goals and enemies. I don't think it was ever more than a "the enemy of my enemy" thing.
---
Because they weren't made by the triglavians. The T2 ships are improvements of the base hulls made by the empires/capsuleers.
---
&gt; true, but my entire argument is i think that should be moved to nullsec
---
Then your argument is shit.
---
&gt;go to delve
---
No, those are raging autists who need a titan to kill subcaps generally, if something was attacking a VNI the pure aggression of such an act would terrify those strong and mighty boson titans.
---
As one of the directors for the Corp, lee did it professionally and smoothly. He was also allowed to remain here if he so choose as someone in leadership as almost unanimously the group wanted him to remain a part of the community we all built. We wish him the best and he almost certainally has a home here if he so wishes.
---
I enjoy the fact that you think EVE has an official Linux launcher.
---
Oh I wasn't suggesting an assembly kit (though those would be cool).
---
More like a standard statuette style plastic cast. I appreciate it may be pricey though when taking hull variety into consideration.
---
give name
---
Thank you ;)
---
That was the worst music I have ever heard.
---
&gt; Then your argument is shit.
---
based on your many points such as:
---
&gt;No, those are raging autists who need a titan to kill subcaps generally, if something was attacking a VNI the pure aggression of such an act would terrify those strong and mighty boson titans.
---
people will defend those who hurt their friends, if not for that reason but to hunt the hunters, it happens all over eve.
---
I've been asking for these since I discovered Eve. I've been building models for over 20 years and to join my 2 favorite hobbies \*Eve and Models\* would be the pinnacle of happiness.
---
There's a small problem with your math. Most of the fights here happen on gates. They have concord/facpo and gate guns. The people doing the work need medium or large guns to damage, and medium or large hulls to actually survive. The ninja salvager uses an insta warp inty that is sig tanked. You miss, they warp, you die accomplishing nothing. They should go red as loot/salvage thieves. Would put a stop to that quick.
---
Because highsec is supposed to be easy-mode for noobs. Its why Concord is there and why the pve is easy too.
---
I can see the validity in removing local. It would make EVE more real and pilot's would be less AFK. Many of us only use Corp/Alliance chats anyway. Tired of hearing even from my own, I'm not worried, no red in local. Ugh! 1 month local removal as a test?

---
Don't worry we gave them so shit much for this feed.   Gf and nice vid!   Genuinely loved it!
---
F
---
ok, I like this one. It could help.
---
EVE is not a game of handholding.
---
If you want to join a corp that teaches you the game, join E-UNI, SB00N, NWFLT, or any other noob oriented corp/alliance.
---
I wonder how many times we can make them anchor/unanchor the structures
---
Do you accept plex donations to your moros?
---
&gt; based on your many points such as:
---
Could say the same about yours.
---
&gt;people will defend those who hurt their friends, 
---
Goons are raging autists but even they don't run along to go save a VNI, which is usually going to be dead by the time you reach it anyway. A carrier or super can replace NSA with sebo and warp before you bubble it, and rorquals are already stuck where they are when people see you unless they're trying to see who can make the least isk.
---
Zarm's Amarr &lt;3 
---
Amarr victor!
---
haha n1
---
Lore-wise, Concord is there only for capsuleer vs capsuleer violence. All other security is managed by the NPC empires.
---
You are stronger than you realize just for doing what you are doing.  I lost an eve bro years ago to suicide and it was devastating, and he was a friend not a spouse.  I hope you get through your own health problems too.  
---
All the best.  I hope you get reps for a long time and a massive KM :)
---
How will they ever recover?
---
I run explo and scout for pvp on one toon, and combat sites and pvp on the other toon.
---
Did Legacy/Imperium coordinate the timing of their attacks today?
---
I mean if you really want to join wormhole spaces shittiest c4 corp, Sleeper Dreams
---
Bout half way in but I have to go to work. Will finish it later. So far my only critique is that the music it a bit loud at times and drowns out your voice. Otherwise this is very well done! I'm looking forward to finishing it after work.
---
And miss the  opportunity of enjoying the salt here? Hell no.
---
&gt; Could say the same about yours.
---
you can't though.

---
it happens outside of delve, it happens in dek and germinate frequently
---
fuck man, it even happens in highsec
---
I joined NC to rorqual mine and rat, this is kind of bullshit. They are telling us to get alts into FRAT to make isk, so i guess that is what i need to do now.
---
&gt;it happens outside of delve, it happens in dek and germinate frequently
---
Deklein barely undock to begin with, so that leaves you with 1 region where you have a realistic chance of finding a VNI response and it's not all that frequent.
---
&gt; it even happens in highsec
---
Anyone krabbing in hisec needs to put down the autism cure and biomass ingame.
---
I hate you! You are probably and sadly correct. Jintaan still has the best solution. Let's go get them!
---
Yeah? Remember when we had no skill injectors? And no alpha accounts? It used to be that you could not inject millions on skillpoints and catch up to a veteran of 10 years. Sure you could buy ships and modules with real money but then again, you wouldn't be able to use it instantly. Nowadays you can directly jump into a super. Aren't you also forgetting the mutaplasmid RNG ISK sink? You can go wild as much as wallet allows you to obtain really OP modules now. So, go figure, jackass.
---
Someone got a booboo and someone won't play fair
---
How many hours you do per day? I run the same but only average 500-800m/wk.
---
I can only hope. Plex my accounts for month.
---
Thank you for reminding me to make a wall mount for the Nyx I printed for myself.
---
They don't. And sansha doesn't camp undocks either. Trig invasion rats sit specifically on the undock, they're pretty smart. They'll also warp around the system and can appear basically anywhere.
---
So... if they can't hunt *with* local, they should go to wormholes where it's harder to hunt? You're right, I can't handle this cogent and well-thought out concept. I admit this fully and without reservation.
---
64 but works much better for me than 32. I just wish there was a way to increase background fps ( dual monitor, I often play Rainbow 6 Siege whilst harvesting. Seeing one screen running at 60fps whilst the other chugs along at 2-3 is horrific)
---
Not using steam for eve.  Lutris for wine management.
---
Can you link it to me in-game or something to Alchemist8
---
Differs per day, sometimes just 2-3 hours sometimes more. And some days you're lucky and other days you're not. 
---
The trick is to do it right using the right ships for it and looking in the right areas.
---
People would have to actually be present for 2nd and 3rd timers ! *waits for hurled pitchforks*
---
Kind of like the concept, would be ok if simply manning the structure stoped the bleeding. Would make it not so much aids to clear the litter of structures all over. Hit them once and see if anyone comes to stop the bleed.
---
The problem here is any requirement CCP puts in, those bastard botters can adapt to.
---
We don't need more "engagement" in mining. Just let me mine my moon from my Refinery without using a mining ship. LOL! The wardecs would be glorious! See that's an actual good idea CCP will never do. The refinery acts as a ship when you are in "control" so why not?
---
Yeah I'm in a quiet area but nearby busy areas, I mean I rolled 100m+ in 5 minutes yesterday afternoon, 45-50m earlier today in maybe 15min of actual work from an unrated escalation chain, though spent 20min traveling for it...
---
Be better? In what way?
---
&gt;Deklein barely undock to begin with, so that leaves you with 1 region where you have a realistic chance of finding a VNI response and it's not all that frequent.
---
it's not simply about the VNI response, it's about a community forming to defend each other, which already actively happens, but would happen much more if local was removed.
---
Source? When do you ever see him talking outside the none internal goon community
---
&gt;While there were always bots, as soon as the game went f2p, the numbers exploded.
---
EVE's problem in a nutshell.
---
True, but subscription to MMO’s is a longtime standard. 
---
To CCP’s credit, it’s very do-able to buy a subscription with in-game currency (though agreed not as easy as it used to be)
---
Microtransactions are completely optional in eve for the full experience (cosmetic, extra currency that isn’t necessary)
---
So be glad that it's visually distinct from the other timers like a limited engagement timer is.
---
I enjoyed this.
---
I'll be there with fireworks.
---
Godspeed, Paola.
---
Response from Eve Forum:
---
Yes - there is an issue post-invasion release. But you can fix it for now by deploying drones to initiate aggro, quickly pull them back in to re-focus aggro on yourslef, then re-deploy for a pre-invadsion style run again.
---
Annoying to have to do it for every room - but not the worst we've had to put up with.
---
All credit goes to Scoots Chocho for the suggested fix: "Launch drones first to bait NPC aggro, then pull them back in to reset aggro onto your Gila. Relaunch drones again and there’s no problem." ~ Scoots ChoCho
---
This being stainguy, you are probably right, or at least B0T with a strong hint of bot.
---
Capital systems actually used to be a thing.  When you controlled X number of systems in an area (I think it was a constellation?) for Y time period, you could declare one system the capital and it was completely invulnerable.
---
Imagine being alliance, kek.
---
They get a lot more gameplay than most other MMOs offer for free.
---
Now he has become Death... destroyer of worlds.
---
Wormhole rats will chew up a venture, but they spawn once on a timer instead of at random. Best to just warp out when they spawn, kill em and then go back to mining.
---
Bless.
---
Neutral reps are the best reps.
---
It's not about the area being quiet or not. It's about the fact that some systems or areas have a higher chance of combat sites than others.
---
I'm kind of happy your just rolling over and exposing your bellies like the puppies you really are, not the wolves you thought you where.It's actually quite pathetic when you look at the historic s of NC/PL and where they currently are right now. Pulled back their Delve deployment to JC only, letting all their space burn and not even hitting anyone in retaliation.
---
See I didn't know that, how do you tell? My area generates wormholes more than anything else.
---
Figured since I was getting the hang of ming but wanted to go more into the game I would approach exploration. Moved into a Gnosis :)
