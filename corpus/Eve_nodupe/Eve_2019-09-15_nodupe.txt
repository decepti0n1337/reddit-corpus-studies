I felt awful, seeing him like that. He's got such love for the game and now it's kicking him in the heart...
---
---
---
I’ve still got a Ritter usb hub.
---
Is that not a bad thing? If given the choice of bots making 3mil/hr vs 3bil/hr I'll take the 3mil easily.
---
Yup, I was worried about blackout but ended up liking it, but I walked away from the game after the cyno changes  were announced.
---
feel free to link said groups
---
Well if you're olmeca gold just turn it into a seriouspost on reddit
---
Sorry I should say, 'They have cancelled future Eve Vegas past this next one'. They say it is mainly do the large subsection of the player base that live in California with some assuming it is from large group of money whales that live in the area.
---
&gt;Man you really have no clue.
---

---
Of course he has a clue. He lived a couple of months without local, that's all the added risk of J-Space with none of the benefits. /s
---
500 mil to light a cyno.... nope
---
Adapt or whine you mean. Because it's been proven to work, lol.
---
1:44 not an armour drake &gt;:( good video tho
---
Tell me about it.  I built a prusa with Clae Ohlson parts adnd still cant print a 3d skull for shiiiiiiieeeeeet
---
Now how do you get a name in the cemeteray. Side note will be making a trip out to pay respects to vile rat and our other fallen capsuleers. o7.
---
What are you even talking about? You don't warp your dic in or even jump it into system until the super enters warp. I know it's a hard concept for you to understand since you need blackout to even have a chance at hunting.
---
If someone wants to risk their super to make bigger ticks why shouldn't they?
---
Local coming back just feels like a punch in the gut, even as a predominantly NS PvE player.
---
What this confirms is that all of the Chaos-era changes have been exactly what we perceived them to be: half-assed, half-baked impulse decisions. Now we know that things will return to the way the were before, and we will be no closer to solutions to some of the game’s biggest issues. 
---
It’s embarrassing for CCP and discouraging for players.
---
Im literally a pure small gang nano fag. My whole post was to emphasize that a harsh transition without something to entice players to crab their space was too much. I wish CCP had iterated on the blackout instead of just doing a complete 360 to prevent the mass exodus.
---
&gt;love within the EVE dev community that it just pours out of ever orifice
---
Ewww... I wanna sue you for the gruesome pictures this sentence made appear in my mind :/
---
What an awesome Saturday night!  what seemed funny, is the whole battlefield after the 1700 ships, capitals, multiple fleets the loot spread was about 200-300km in diameter (not very big) as no one really cared for kiting or minimising losses. absolute meat grinder.
---
i look forward to the next one. be it SM3LL, or any other group looking for a good time.  (if they think they could pull it off :D)
---
Well, then you have to skill v0v
---
Epic fun gf's to test and horde good show boys. we have started to plain next yrs already so be rdy for Sm3ll's 10th should be bigger and better then ever
---
in your fevered imagination, how do you expect that works? Who do you think we complain to at CCP in order to get our way? How do we communicate? How does CCP keep from getting caught? I'm really curious to know how detailed your delusion conspiracy theories are for if it's just as simple as, "goons are winning and I'm not so goons are cheating."
---
Not a fan.
---
Sure, but you are making 3-4b an hour ratting in those dreads. If they DO die, insurance is pretty damn good too. Also, how often are competent groups specifically rolling to try to find dread ratters?
---
I would be if I kept with it. Honestly I don't lose that much and I don't spend that much. I think the most ISK I had was about 60 bil.
---
I tend to believe the player-count actually adds all players in all locals. And thats why player-count dropped so hard during blackout... Cause, well, they ve not been shown there. \*is sure datt is da troof!\*
---
At least we killed this horrendous Leviathan.
---
Lot of fun, lot of deaths, couldn't have been better.
---
Honestly a legit good suggestion. Or even just make dreads super cheap so it's worth it to go for the big dread bombs even if you don't have a 100% chance for a big kill.
---
It'd be fairly easy to revamp ratting sites so you actually needed PvP mods (scrams, webs, etc). Burner missions arguably accomplish this in a sense. But nobody PvPs in their burner frig, right? 
---
The main issue is an expensive, focused PvE *or* PvP ship will still eat shit to a gang of 10 dudes designed to hunt down and frag it. (Even if you're ratting in a bait pvp ishtar, if you get caught by a 10-man cruiser gang you're buggered.) So if you wanna maximize ticks, you'll still pack a cyno alt &amp; roll with a standing fleet that parks boson titans on all the ingates and dock up if your tripwire reports a neut within 3 jumps. Content is bad for your isk making. You want minimum content. 
---
I suspect the entire *premise* of ratting and mining anomalies will need to go, replaced by some sort of very different activity. I don't really know what. Incursion fleets? Group abyssal content? Facwar but fixed so plexing doesn't suck? Whatever it is, it'll have to integrate a high degree of affordability and competition. You should have reasons to seek out kills because it'll make you extra money, on a personal as well as alliance level. 
---
The abyssal gauntlet is a good example of what we could try; you both run the site, but at the end you can try to mug the other guy for his abyssal loot + whatever his ship drops. Atm it's just too expensive; if you both use 2b cruisers, and you win 50% of your fights on average, you'll still be down &gt;750m per fight on average. Unless the site routinely drops over 700m of loot per person, it's not worth risking the combat.
---
Blow me
---
It would be nice to have some type of economical way to re-specialize. I’m sharing this as a new player for months into the game. The current system to try to respect is extremely expensive and out of reach for most new players who cannot afford real dollars to assist.
---
Completely unaffiliated, but that looks like one hell of a time you guys and girls had over there. Also;
---
&gt; with the Leshaks dropping like the British pound
---
Savage!
---
Oh good, you still don't understand what an exploit is. Feel free to report it to ccp if you actually believe a game mechanic is an exploit.
---
You just have very little WH knowledge and it clearly shows in throughout your posts. If you believe C6 farming is so simple, why haven't you joined in?
---
I see CCP pandering to the lowest common denominator again. Good thing I unsubscribed.
---
That'll just cause a few blocs to cluster around where the big resources are. I don't mind CCP giving blocs/krabs tools to build up the roman empire. But give us barbarians tools to burn it down.
---
There is a saying in business...
---
CTO" what happens if we train the people and they leave"
---
CEO" what happens if we don't and the stay"
---
I think the problem with catering to 70% who want to quit but dont. Is you are not catering to the poeple who need a challenging game to stay. We are creating a culture of catering to blobs. It will be a slow death, and a boring one.
---
I came back to eve after years for the chaos, now i know ccp just lapdogs to the blocks. Goons will destroy the game before PA ever does. 
---
Welcome back to hello kitty online.
---
Blackout was heaven for hunters because it made it easy and shit. It doesn't need to be either extreme, pre blackout and during blackout was skewed in either direction. 
---
But I think it's a bit silly to assume CCP are just suddenly going to stop making changes to mix up nullsec just because one didn't work.
---
Again what's harder? Clicking once to warp away to safety or navigating nullsec space, bypassing camps, dodging hunting parties and finding targets?
---
A cheap structure that has 2 timers both with 1m HP. 
---
Hard pass
---
You kinda did not get that i do not blame Goons for the mess, did you?
---
At times Goons DID get their wishes and other times they DIDN'T. There was a time when everything that came from the Goon community was dismissed simply because it came from the Goon community.
---
A lot has been buried by time and propaganda, but claims that CCP made changes that benefited Goonswarm are almost as old as Goonswarm is. Some more valid, some certainly less.
---
no, eve is how old? ive played how long? and sorry but rorquals turned people into fat lazy krabbers. and ended nullsec small gang pvp
---
&gt; Fuck knows how many players they have lost to wow  
---
They can stay in WoW if they want Disney World.
---
It didn't even take a day.
---
the fuck does that even mean.
---
them being in the game at all creates inflation, and drives prices up.

no, in every other game you cant loose your stuff. ever, like star citezen..... it never dies. ever

`It's hard to kill pvp ships if my whole alliance only flies untanked vnis`
---
Pretty much. I'm in my 30s now with a family. My Eve activity can't be done nonchalantly semi AFK. I get small window gaps of time where I need to do some murderous shit and then get offline. I'm not the 19 or 20 something year old that can just no-life it 10 hours a day.
---
but this would apply to hisec lowsec and nullsec..... everyone who went afk would loose thier stuff lol...and never return, no matter how much we would want it. it would destroy any future left, if any atall, of eve.

take a look @ here. Made some trophies for G-Fleet and for EVE-Fans. Still try to get better

---
Is it? Would you prefer permanent inaction until the game's slow descent ends? Any change would have driven certain players to quit simply because something changed, that's not an excuse to do nothing.
---
I would do it
---
wat
---
is it just me or do skill injector eyes look just like weed eyes?
---
You're dumb.
---
Good, dumb krabs need to disappear from eve as soon as possible.
---
I don't know if this is a good solution. But I do know that we need a solution that sits somewhere between blackout and status quo.
---
I was a supporter of blackout but must acknowledge that the effect on subs must have been too great. At the same time local tools like NEAR2 are absolutely terrible for the game.
---
I don't know what the answer is but I hope I didn't come back for nothing. The game needs more risk.
---
Again, I don't know how you don't understand simple phrasing. I didn't say it was an exploit, I said it can be exploited. Two completely different things, but apparently you are too dense to understand that. 
---
Second, I don't need more isk and if I do my preferred method is reactions, not ratting.
---
What makes you so sure? Please elaborate. Genuinely interested.
---
Bring back local in all its Glory...
---
But pvp timers prevent cloak, warp and dock.
---
If you (Hunters) want to pvp you gotta risk the loss to the counter drop.
---
I'm a care bear by nature, but what triggers me the most to unsub is pvp hunters that run at the first sign of resistance.
---
Then play gate games for an hour cloaky camping because they didn't get their easy vni kill.
---
its not the worst idea ever.
---
&gt; CCP has just shown they don't have it in them to make the hard choices 
---
Fact.
---
That's meth bro. And you misspelled Hilmeth*
---
Sure. Why the hell not?
---
Oh I get it. You seem to think that what we want sometimes translates into CCP action when the reality is the CCP does what it wants and if it benefits us or hurts us, it's just coincidence. They don't give our opinions any more weight than they give yours. Deal with it.
---
Boost your skill with an item.
---
Its an excuse to take more then 10 seconds to dream up the next chaos change. He rushed this bullshit, while ignoring every single person who said how bad this would go, then ignored the better ideas that involved delayed local and shit the game up in a way it has been damaged in years, now its rolled back and we get to wait and see if the player base returns, if they do great, if they don't he just shaved thousands of players off the games playerbase with no functional plan to replace them.
---
It would make things worse. The only thing worse than no information is incorrect information.
---
Krabs whine about blackout for months
---
Blackout reverted
---
Therefore it is clearly the optimal strategy
---
Little guys don’t build supers

Was a Grate time loved to FC the Smell Fleet with the help of Omar as well and Vence. Sm3ll is the funniest and best corp I have even been in and this was my first Smell Bday Fleet as a SM3ll member but well not be my last Smell Member till the end. Ty for the Fun Knerf and Smell ,

---
id say FW is similar to when i started playing in 2016, its just people PVP'ers spread out a lot less then they used to
---
Special mention to Omar living like 10 min through Leshak reps, coming close to death every volley.
---
Set up ships in 1 system and stay there, let people come to you
---
Don't worry, blackout will be there in the wormholes, where the 200 people who like it can use their bombers on the hobodreads and closed off krab holes.
---
Unless some major changes to Eve occur I don't see bots ever leaving. Like I'm not talking about add a new module or structure kind of change. I'm talking like a full physics rewrite kind of change. The combat gameplay in eve is too simplistic to not be botted IMO.
---
I can play too!
---
Goons' income share relative to all other alliances increases under blackout.
---
Players with bots whine and cry neglecting to mention their boxing empires.
---
Blackout reversed.
---
Goons get screwed again.
---
I've always kinda wished Lego would would release Eve sets.
---
Yeah 3-4B/hr once or twice a week, maybe a total of 8B a week. You need 4 dreads on grid to make that isk/hr plus maybe a rorq, probably around 3.5B a piece. So you are placing 15-20B on grid. please tell me the risk/reward factor on that?  
---
All of the major high-class groups are capable of easily killing dreads, so Hawks/HK/Novac/TDSIN. Then there are groups like duralex and starchasers who have a C6 static and the former is practically a dedicated dread hunting corp. Then we have the c2 guys like inner hell, who, if you are rolled into, will face roll you into oblivion. Even some C4 groups like POSPY can kill dreads. 
---
Let me just reiterate, you do not need a C6 static to hunt dread ratter either. Watch this [killboard](https://zkillboard.com/group/485/losses/w-space/) and tell me how safe the dreads are please.
---
I suspect it will arrive (possibly as a free, limited option) if CCP decides to tackle the important parts of balancing the game: sov and capital ships.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If caps simply get rebalanced, the amount of whining will be worse than the blackout and cyno changes combined. But if they announce in advance "we're doing this and this to capitals so there's a reason to undock in smaller stuff again" and add a way for people to extract and reinject without penalties as a limited event, it will be easier to stomach for the people who simply injected into capitals because that's what they were told to do the moment they joined a null corp.
---
Imagine a special type of extractor that can extract only capital-related skills of any kind (rorquals, carriers, dreadnought guns, the whole lot) and you need only one to do it. Now imagine that the injectors it creates do not have the usual penalties, but everyone gets the full amount of SP when injecting.
---
At that point, if you don't want to fly caps anymore, you can either reinject your own SP at no penalty and use them for other skills, or sell them on the market at a price higher than normal injectors, since they would be penalty-free.
---
Well, how about you deal with it that CCP isn't as 'neutral' as you claim them to be.
---
They never where.
---
No one is by the way.
---
But i am wondering why you are so persistant in trying to convince me and the other readers.
---
I don't have the free time to spare to spend 200 hours somewhere with my name (I'm duck nf named Frigate PVP for Bob's sake) advertise what I'm here for, before I get more than a few fights an hour.
---
They kinda tried that with dust, but they put it on the PS3 during its last days, then refused to move it to the PS4 and it was released so early in its development that by the time it was ready no one was playing anymore because they had moved on to other games.
---
Increasing the limit does make sense as more players now make their own corps after the wardec changes.
---
It was supposed to be connected, but it failed so fast and CCP moved so slow in developing it that Dust died before they got to that point.
---
Who's trying to convince you? I'm just trying to figure out how much tin foil you go through on a monthly basis.
---
My mans asked a question and you had to be that guy.
---
Which is something that has been pointed out since the early days and here we are 16 years later still waiting for something more engaging in PVE then repetitively shooting like red icons
---
Everytime I heard a hunter complain it was hard in regards to the zkill/DOTLAN blackout it was always suffixed with "but it was really fun". More of an acknowledgement that it was harder to hunt but they liked it that way.
---
I fixed it.
---
Go play your switch with the little time you get not playing nanny.
---
How do you compete with WoW? You encourage super boring repetitive krabbing :'(
---
That was the 20th Marginis to be destroyed. There remain 168.
---
Yeah, we should roll them back too.  The combo of having local and limited hostile cyno ships has made krabbing even safer than before.
---
No.
---
&gt;Blackout was heaven for hunters because it made it easy and shit  
---
  
---
If we talk about simply hunting for kills you're propably right.  
---
But for groups like the one i'm in that are made up of mostly people that despise the blocs and what null has become it was like it's suddenly possible to really hurt these groups, especially goons. Do more to them than kill a ratter here and there. And the MER speaks for itself in that regard. Honestly i don't care about the small dudes. Let them krab away in gated anoms that can't be entered by covert ships or whatever. There would obviously need to be some countermeasure to botting but that's prolly not gonna be easy and i was told acceleration gates with captchas would be aids :(  
---
I don't think CCP is gonna experiment much more but well as i said, that's just me having lost that bit of new hope that made me even resub. Maybe they're gonna do it but it's propably just gonna be a fuckup again.
---
Still a better love story than twilight.
---
&gt; you have belts 
---
which 99% of people won't go near in nullsec because the africanized rats can kill caps.
---
escalations expire in 24h. 10/10s sell for 100m. So you have to find a buyer that has time available to fit in that window. Significantly easier when you can just throw it up on public contract.
---
no

---
Tbf getting rid of inextremis is something they should  have done 5 years ago.
---
nice post op I rate 8/8
---
yeah I get it they wanted to make null dangerous again and they tried and it failed. Now to save whats left of the dwindling player base due to the blackout, just giving local back is not enough. It might bring back some, maybe 1/4 if no more than half.
---
Where can I buy a fully fit hel for 7 bil? Asking for a friend?
---
Quite a lot of bots moved over to abyssals, which aren't really any worse than nullsec. Nullsec was only so common as it was the easiest way.
---
thank you for your service.
---
Was a lot of fun thanks for the invite.
---
Looks like a really fun fight
---
Exactly, I left over Hilmeth fucking the game up with his Incarna bullshit, stayed away for years over that experience. I wind up coming back to hang with friends who reactivated all these years later, get one solid year of fun flying in and then Hilmeth goes right back to giving me reasons not to play again. I've killed all my accounts again and will take a look in a few months when work slows down after the holidays to see if its worth trying again or if he has just completely fucked the game.
---
I think its very typical. I am almost 50. I have a demanding job, kids still in the house, busy family life. There are times when I group mine in my Rorq to earn a few ISKIES here and there. But PLEX is my go-to staple for me enjoying the very, very, limited game time I have. I would guess my ration of buying PLEX and making it is 80/20. Good write up and very accurate.
---
First thing to be thrown out, fozzie.
---
I'd be happy with a Thera list, it's not like y'all don't already have that available.
---
You have local back try and enjoy that for the time being. 
---
They said blackout was for an indeterminate amount of time and it is now coming to an end. Cyno’s they have said are to OP and are going to be balanced somehow, maybe this current trial is not the way but one thing is pretty certain - cyno’s will never be the same again. Try and enjoy the game in its current state and future state
---
That could have been happening already.
---
Eve was never "good" in the traditional sense, the UI was/is shit the NPE is a joke that funnels you into quitting the game, the company never follows up on changes with the iterations it promises and their support ticket handling time can make comcast look good. What Eve had going for it for years was being totally unique. But when you shit up the game as bad as hilmeth has done at times that uniqueness isn't enough to outweigh the frustration he causes.
---
&gt;a constantly dwindling ~~playerbase~~ bot count and salty risk averse krabs
---
Oh, just a couple of hundred tons compared to the millions of solar masses during my active Eve time.
---
If you’re happy, i can start blaming Goonswarm for the bad weather.
---
It’s definitely a plot to make more people play games instead of doing activity outside and thus save Eve because some of them will eventually become Eve players.
---
No that's the point I do get it's more than a chat channel. So if he is going to say thay I can say the reverse. Either both statement is stupid or both statement is accurate.
---
You have been pretty vocal about your hatred of blackout as an alliance. I’m not saying they caved to your daily Reddit threads but the average player who doesn’t understand the game heard their leaders tell them it was broken and not to play and they listened. 
---
A shame but blackout was fun whilst it lasted!
---
&gt;if you follow all "golden rules" and do everything correctly. 
---
But hilmeth did not even attempt that, in fact he blatantly stated he was going to do the opposite because he WANTED people to not be happy and to stress out over the outcome. Well he got his wish fucking granted.
---
I mean, it's been about 4 years since I lived in wormholes, but even back then I was thinking that part of a solution could be too remove - or vastly change - mass limits on wormholes.
---
Maybe let me bring as much mass through as I want, but only allow combat ships 2-5 transits per pilot. Or, higher total mass limits but same mass limits per transit. Maybe a deployable which takes a singlage of hours to generate a wormhole to a particular part of space depending on the quality of structure and the script/fuel loaded in it.
---
They actually did this about ten years ago. You could buy all ‘tier 2’ battleships at then time like a Raven, Apoc, etc. They didn’t sell that well so CCP stopped.
---
This is the lowest effort titan kill post I have ever seen
---
What amazes me is people like you and me will tell the many Eve sycophants that exist here what has happened. IS happening and is LIKELY to happen, including whole CORPS quitting before and now. Including people with MULTIPLE PAYING accounts quitting and the EVE space brown noses keep insisting no no no..there's nothing wrong everything is GREAT!
---
SNUFF spy burned his alt to kill two titans, got corp temporarily removed to avoid further damage, v0v
---
Eh, I'm not sure the people that unsubbed were mostly super and titan pilots. I mean, supers that don't spend 95% of their time undocked in anoms.
---
yeah but I got a pretty good BFG off
---
the problem with industrial cynos is that indsutrial ships are the slowest , and most vulnerable ships and you somehow expect freighter pilots to get them 15 systems into null
---
I do. Long ago I modded and mapped on Unreal Engine.
---
I don't think you're here to be polite....
---
Well, I boutght a Stribog in SG today. Just saying.
---
If Star Citizen or something similar to EVE but expanded like Star Citizen ever got their their shit together, EVE won't last long. No, it won't...
---
Who said anything about goons specifically? If anything, you assuming that this is what i mean makes you look guiltier than you probably are.
---
It looks like "Shit, that's guy's talking about something i don't like, quick let's lash out at him!", lol
---
In all seriousness, i've seen people (admittedly, very few people) from the big blocs too saying they enjoyed the blackout.
---
I'm just poking fun at the guys who screamed their lungs off and stopped logging in until CCP caved in, so they could play space farmville again. These guys did just what i said. They didn't adapt. They just whined until they got their way.
---
Aren't those the same that spawn in anoms? I had a dread spawn on me a few days ago.
---
I should have known that starting any thread on Reddit would call the trolls.
---
Okay, but that's actually true.
---
&gt; effectively quadrupling the amount of grinding you have to do to plex or fund your umbrellas
---
If ore prices drop, so do cap prices. The grind stays the same.
---
&gt; My income streams are purely based on being a middleman, so i don't care what the price is
---
&gt;  If faction warp scramblers are 50 million a pop i'm selling fewer but making making more isk per item. If they become 5 million a pop i'll be making much less per item, but everyone will be fitting one so i'll be selling much more.
---
&gt; i'm in the enjoyable position to be able to give zero fucks whatsoever about the value (or lack thereof) of nullsec products
---
And where do these warp scramblers would come from, exactly? The price right now comes from their relative rarity, in case you didn't know, and they tend to, well, explode on pvp ships. They won't drop in price just because people grind for them, they've been doing that for years.
---
Didn't mean to say supers and titans are unsubbing, meant to reference the rule that Goons have docked up ratting supers/titans until further notice.
---
The supers and titans that are easy kill mails
---
Okay, my bad. I completed this thread with another one. I am bad.
---
I see the Unity tag. But I'm playing EVE reskinned as SG.
---
Thats how it always worked.
---
Great AAR
---
THE WAR TO END ALL WARS
---
As great as blackout was for hunting, I don't think ccp liked the fact that people were not logging in at all. Thats not something that they can allow to happen.
---
Hilmer is still wanting to shake up null but he's not stupid enough to think it's a good idea to make everyone just trying to make isk quit.
---
The problem is not the "too productive" part. It's the "not nearly destructive enough" part.
---
As for why bother, for responses exactly like yours.
---
I just love typing entire essays at a time discussing a game we all supposedly like and are somewhat invested in, only to get condescending one-liners in response from the demographic that's supposedly the most invested, most hardcore of all of us, and certainly the most vocal and self-important one.
---
Yet they can't take 5 minutes to push their opinion with a well formed counter-argument and have to resort to ad hominems or yeah-whatevers. That's why. The emperor is naked and all that jazz.
---
Hope i answered your question adequately.
---
No, other than the obvious things that only happen in EVE.
---
The problem wasn't the idea, i think blackout was a good concept. CCP's issue is either they blindside the community and/or they use the laziest fix that they can. Rather than adding something like an "Upwell Observatory" that could be entosised thus blacking out local in a constellation. Instead they simply go "no local for null"  They did they same thing with fozzy sov, instead of taking the opportunity to build a new system from the ground up they go "lets make sov like faction warfare, we already have a system in place for that!" 
---
These days when it comes to development CCP is like the child you want to lose your mind at for getting by with C's on their report card when you know the kid can get A's or at least B+'s
---
I was there. &lt;3
---
Fixed it
---
You really disliked blackout didn’t you. I can read the venom in your posts. Try and enjoy the game, it is after all, a game
---
no, that dread is just a regular old rat, you can kill it and it won't call in friends, the rats with a little diamond next to your name fly in groups complete with logi and ewar, and they will escalate on you and have killed people who were dumb enough to let them tackle their caps. Hell one idiot lost a titan to them last year. No one is going to take barges, exhumers, orcas, or rorqs to a belt where those NPC death machines can tackle and kill them.
---
Correction, harassment doesn't do this now. That's the whole problem.
---
It used to be able to do this and the game was much more balanced and more fun. There were times that alliances would fold because of harassment and lack of isk-making. It's a legitimate real-world strategy and it's a shame we can't replicate more of that in EvE.
---
The rest of my post was self-explanatory i think, i have nothing to add there.
---
I fully agree with you, but why stop there? We should even improve titans. Make using a boson activate a selfdestruct timer that will only be stopped if you join a special teamspeak server and sing a song.
---
Inextremis was not in GSF, so how could we kick from Alliance? TnT kicked them.
---
&lt;3 Wibla
---
But why? Bombers are pretty easy to catch, i think the minimum is 4s align time
---
And please add a mobile cloak disappation field for all those cloakys that as soon as they see something they don't like just burn and cloak. Its nice to have it as an option but it should not be 'I have to burn within 2000m of it to decloak it.'
---
Revert all cyno changes ONLY IF Capital ships are banned from fitting a cyno generator.
---
The problem with having another pos to fuel and keep up is....another pos to fuel and keep up. That's something that ccp has said before that large null blocks have too many structures and on the other end, for the large null blocks, it would just be another structure to fuel and keep up. Having something to only have local in certain parts of a region of null space goes against what they dont want.
---
This always was their problem.
---
Their approach is usually a sledgehammer instead of a needle.
---
And a lot of stuff sits there rotting in a half baked stake for an eternity until the next blow comes that replaces it instead of fixing things that just needed a few tweaks to be good.
---
They have that already.
---
Suggestion, remove the BS fitting suggestion warnings
---
I think we need to add chaos to the r/eve meta. Every time a goon whines CCP deletes a CFC keepstar.
---
Ahahahahaaaaa. Hahaaaaa. Ha.
---
Disagree completely, FW isn't dead at all. Come out to Placid/Blackrise and you'll find fights most of the time, in most the timezones! And this comes from an Aussie...
---
To the OP, check out the Gallente/Caldari side. There's a lot of 1v1's. Just be careful though, there's also a lot of people flying annoying kite-y stuff but that can be fun to catch if you're already on the button in the plex.
---
Finally, if you want to feel like the PvP means something, then join a side. Get in to the FW war itself and you'll find people working together, coordinating ops/fleets/offensives, in a gameplay where solo PvP pilots are needed/used 😃
---
Okay then, so we agree it should have risk? Because with local, there is zero risk.
---
We have been vocal about our hatred for the effect it had on the game population. all blackout did was make  brokenly easy for me to kill krabs without giving them any fucking chance at all to escape or see me coming. Which resulted in fewer and fewer of those players logging in so I could hunt them.
---
Meh...
---
Don't kid yourself man: no matter how many hours you put in and how many nerds you impress, you're just playing a game. You're not actually accomplishing shit beyond getting yourself off.
---
P.S. I'm sorry your dad wasn't there for you.
---
lol
---
Wait what?

Hmm Hoed

I really thought that’s how they would end it, see my Fuel Your Own Fluid Routers post, this feels like a big step back at this point.

if you have the character fully skilled, you can extract 3.5 Skill Injectors every month.  Accounting for the cost of extractors and 500 plex, after you sell 3.5 skill injectors it is very cheap to maintain omega.  When you don't need SP on the alt, it is very cheap to maintain the account.
---
&gt; People dont fight in C6 space, only farm alts live there. That is why the data is so skewed.
---
So it looks like CCP has a place to start introducing chaos.  Maybe random triglavian fleets to hunt out money printing dreads.
---
Try again but this time form a coherent sentence.
---
Damn. They replace them faster than ccp removes them. Better luck next time
---
&gt; Oh and it's a massive buff to nullsec invading wh space because now they can bring 900 dreads into your hole
---
Sounds like content to me.
---
Yes, chaos for everybody
---
i dont disagree with that, and as asinine as it sounds keeping shit refueled is probably someones preferred game play. Thing is once you have 100 structures to manage, whats 101?
---
This is what happens when the herds move in and demand a safe pasture to graze on. They don't want these shitty lions eating them alive.
---
You basically go from 50/50 happy/sad to 50/50 sad/happy. I don't get it CCP.  I wouldn't even say 50/50 since those who got salty over the blackout probably were bot farms and multiboxing pve accounts. Many people adapted and stayed with the new risk.
---
A middle ground is needed. This full local in null will just breed bullshit PvP content, while PvE makes trillions. But I give it to the Goon campaign. They really voice the loudest and cried often making a minority seem like a majority. Well played babies.
---
It sounds like what i left nullsec to get away from. Delete capitals from the game tbh.
---
They did. Project Triforce.
---
Still waiting for my Nyx. 
---
I don't think they'll ever do it again.
---
We already have that.  
---
But the price is steep.
---
&gt;pleb
---
You feel better after saying that?
---
I wish CCP would blackout your posts
---
I've been in small alliances that have
---
I mean... I get all this already. I know what some folks consider dead or active is different. Not judging. I just understand that my idea of a slow hour in FW space is a solid hour for other people. It is what it is.
---
Do you think I'd find MORE fights, given my peculiarities, in a militia or as a neutral? I might be past seeking "meaning" in my MMOs. I'm not past seeking max fun per hour though, and for me fun is trying to kill some other asshole in a ship fairly similar to mine.
---
Nobody can be this retarded, right?   Right!?
---
You can play and find out! But I know others do for sure
---
Man, you really need to learn the meaning of the word subtlety. This is poor trolling.

Hey, Been playing around with c3 sites in my c13 and i gotta say the confessor is so good for running them. Ive changed a cap recharger for a cap booster and it solves all my problems with neuting sites. the only issues are webbing ones and I'm still trying to figure out how i can change my fit to deal with those... but im not too sure yet
---
Sounds like a real fast way of getting a character kicked from the Corp/alliance/escalation sale channel
---
The alliance level used to be "Well, we'll have these R64s we can take that will fund our war efforts and srp"  Now, there isn't as much of an incentive to take space and fight on an alliance level.  What we need is a reason to pick a fight, and stick with it, as well as a reasonable victory condition since the current meta is to wear out your opponent till they just give up playing the game because they are tired of all the stupid ass structure and entosis pings going out, followed by fights that they can look at the numbers and know they won't win, depriving both sides of actual fighting.
---
But when the blackout was announced all the pvpers said adapt or die? Now it's all tears? How about you adapt or die. 
---
PS I am a pvper who also mines for ships to field
---
Nobody feels pitty for a goon.
---
Fuck all those faggot krabs.
---
Mkay, so we take a 1500 man sub cap fleet in, same effect.
---
I have the same mouse pad. I paired mine with a gel keyboard wrist rest. Works great! [35"x13" Nebula Cloth Gaming Pad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0144KWUEK/)

This only cements that goons will now get their way, regardless of the situation, because they have evidence that they can just unsub for a few months and have a change in their favor.
---
Hours of explosions, so many flashes, had a seizure, what a great time!

---
&gt; But worse was the people leaving Eve in thousands. 
---
I said it once and I'll say it again. Bots gave the illusions of player activity. When local's lights turn back on, bots are going to, once again, give the illusion of player activity. Don't believe me? When local is back and you're travelling through your empire's space, try finding the bots in their sites, convo them, and see if they respond and start an actual conversation. You'll find that null was just as empty and lifeless before and after blackout as it was during.
---
I don't mean join in the plexing part exactly (especially if it's not your thing), but you'll be working with more people and have some idea of where the action is at any given time (usually).
---
An actively contested system means that there will be large groups around so you can mess with them, but it often means that the surrounding systems will also have people working away in the plexes.
---
Another benefit is that you would show up more clearly on the opposing factions overview as a pilot that is engagable. 
---
The only benefit in your case to plexing would be a way to make some ISK/standings/lp whilst your wait or look for fights. 
---
To summarise: I think joining a side would increase your chances of action.
---
you mean krabs, not players, there is a huge difference tbh.
---
You're not alone, I had a lot of fun with it too.
---
For a low price of 1 billion isk I wont post the rest the month. Refund guaranteed if broken
---
Well it can't hurt to try I guess. I've already had a few whirls at neutral FW, and while I've enjoyed the 2-3 fights I'd find per hour, it definitely hadn't been enough to keep me hooked.
---
Oh come on it's not like we have any room to talk.
---
Stay neutral if you're looking to just solo, it'll give you more potential opponents.
---
Yeah, make space exploitation degrade the lands. Too much mining? Lower amount of ore per asteroid, longer time between spawns. Too much ratting? Longer time between spawns. Too much moonmining? Unmined moons increase in value whilst mined ones lower in value. 
---
Make it a balance shift that is done weekly or so subtly changing over time, using data from all of nullsec. Where unexploited space increases in value and overexploited null decreases.
---
Delve narrative must be maintained regardless of facts sir.

You have come to the right game
---
There's an alpha-only corp thats been recruiting in r/evejobs  if that sort of pvp is up your alley.
---
According to his suggestion you can only bring 900 ships.
---
good thing about blackout, all the krabs left.
---
bad thing about blackout, all the krabs left.
---
Happy bday smell, battle lasted ages
---
&gt;Majority of Eve didn’t know what most t2 ships were. T3 wasnt a thing. 
---
Uh what? t2 ships were WELL established in in 08, 08 was also the year wormholes dropped AKA t3 ships.  
---
&gt; 10/10 esculations from anoms, 
---
10/10's existed though, and if you know how there spawning worked you could farm them very effectively, it wasn't rocket science.
---
&gt; mass production of end game ships 
---
The roaming dread fleet was very much a thing in 08' that was the times equivilant to the end game ship they followed much the same proliferation as the supercarrier (which was pretty shit at the time, and the titan, which was a drive by machine at the time and massively op). 
---
The only thing your right about is rorq mining and injectors, which are not really the problem with modern day eve.  The problem with modern day eve is the social engineering that we the player have embarked on.  Its very hard to balance a single shard uninstanced game against social engineering.
---
No, average players logged on and found it was not fun. Nobody needed to tell them that.
---
I'd love to see Falcon pul off Interview With The Vampire.
---
That would be nice. As a pure-blooded PvPer, I could live with that
---
Holy shit goons are retarded. There were plenty of people still out ratting / mining. Two days ago I came across a grid that had ~10 rorqs and multiple hulks mining. Guess I imagined it?
---
So true
---
i agree with you, notsomuch on the bot front, they just moved to highsec, but on the krab part.  Problem is, CCP doesn't differentiate between a 10x krab accounts and 10x player accounts, its all about bottom line.  People keep making the argument that all players are good for the game, but I think krabs are worthless or even worse, detrimental because of what they do to the econ.  However, being that krabs are a huge amount of the subs that play Eve Online, I'd rather have Eve Online exist with krabs, than not make enough money and go under.   
---
I'm glad they changed things up and are trying to resolve some huge known issues, hopefully their next iterations can solve the faucets like blackout but not cause a mass krab unsubbing.
---
He has spent his income.
---
Damn. I should have gotten a Dominix. Been playing since 2007, my ship was a Dominix for over a decade
---
&gt;No but we didn't have jumping.
---
We had jumping
---
&gt; unning logistics for an alliance involved scouting and escort fleets. 
---
For smaller alliances yes, for larger ones you could use titan bridges because you had titans. 
---
&gt; And we didn't have caps.  
---
Yes we did, caps were 06 I want to say.
---
&gt; Or asset safety. 
---
Indestructible outposts... didn't really need asset safety
---
3 krabs in the audience rejoice.
---
So you're saying I can bring my drake...?
---
Also a bucket of rust to give it that "Minmatar feel". Unless Tech 2. Then the rust needs to be replaced with shiny duck tape
---
Lmao there is risk, several supers would die a day, it just requires skill. Why should a ratter that's paying attention be punished cause noobs want easy kills.
---
I'm sorry you have no time to actually put effort into anything that would provide you with a meaningful sense of accomplishment. Mid-life crisis hitting extra hard, I can tell from your replies. My point is you work hard for something and it's more rewarding when that thing pays of. I.E. working for isk to get a ship and coming out of an engagement alive. But when you just throw money at the screen there's really no risk because your "super interesting job" will keep ISK rolling in. I could pay for PLEX, I have 10k in savings and I take a vacation overseas every summer, but please continue your sad narrative about how I'm broke and living in granny's basement. I'll be here laughing at your every extra cent going to your young'uns.
---
Get off our celebrating corp birthday you leech.
---
but that would take people and would cost them, money, time and effort, CCP hates doing that.
---
Free if you do it with me
---
The fat need is like we nerd to protect the Goonie goons
---
Hek yes they are
---
Ok fair point but I'm not sure where 100% safe maximum efficiency isk generation is required for t1 frigate replacement? Rat in a cormorant, or whatever the fuck destroyer it is that can rat. A t1 fit t1 frigate is worth like 2 battleship rats, if that? Blackout has actual zero impact on your ability to safely profit doing that. The only serious additional risk is carried by high value ratters, which should *not*, under any circumstances be activities new characters are involved in
---
give  structure to fuel to keep local online,it explodes or go low power =no local
---
I have actually started really liking your killboard, especially on mobile.
---
If they died with local up, they clearly weren't paying attention. Why is this so hard?
---
I'd support it.  Injectors have taken away any form of importance characters had in their skills anyway so it'd be nice to be able to reshuffle my SP around without losing like 20% of it.
---
No, I’m sorry for being aggro ) I think we’re on the same page! Though I loved blackout lol.
---
Great post. Thanks.
---
100% agreed good sir. I'm in the same exact boat.
---
'work hard'... *playing a video game*.
---
Too OP imo, though a cool idea - maybe cov ops ships have a bonus to the delay, or scramble their signal around the constellation so that they come and go in Local.
---
I don't think CCP had a ''grand vision'' for the game these past 3 years, noe Himlar wanted to pull EVEs direction into the ''chaos era'', but it's already too late.
---
For me EVE has always been a game where to get that one kill you had to lay your trap and wait for hours, but apparently for others content has to come to them, or else they wont play. I don't know where this comes from because average age of players is high so they should not be like those ''kids who want everything handed to them'', but reality is different
---
I mean fair point, I guess I don't really have a better solution than having the newbies in nullsec, but I don't really see how blackout is the end of the world for them, as they aren't generally capable of doing activities that would attract serious attention. I feel like it's mostly doom and gloom from turbokrabs that puts them off actually being willing or able to undock to go do anything
---
Gracias  fue increible para mi tener la oportunidad de estar ahi y celebrarlo gracias a todos sus pilotos /thanks was avesome for me to be there and enjoy the same with all  your pilots Cacique Yuhasz   hugs  from cuba
---
Know who doesn't deserve to live in null sec, or anywhere in EVE? Bots. Know who is gonna come back in droves after the blackout is lifted? Bots.
---
Yea this is a cool idea, I prefer the delay linked to ADMs though as hopefully this would encourage people to spread out to maintain a strong border with full intel.
---
Supercap pilots that didn't exempt from fleet warps lol.
---
I’m all for that as well, my dude. I use them, but there’s other less OP ways to track down targets and busy areas.
---
A hobby is a hobby regardless. Not anyone's fault your degenerating baby-boomer brain can only acknowledge "throwing the pigskin" and "diecast model cars" as something you can work hard towards. You get out of this game what you put in. I have more fun because I'm not 100% reliant on nullbloc trained FC to tell me when to press F1. I've worked hard to become a better solo/small gang pilot and that's meaningful to me. But please, continue, what would you "work hard" for to feel accomplished? Knocking up your old lady? Any schmuck can crank out a kid. You're impressing no one.
---
vily wannabe
---
What bit are you having trouble with?
---
Haha, will do bud. Now exactly which systems do you see people doing it? ))
---
And if I were that NPC faction I'd sure as hell make sure those pesky capsuleers could be seen in local while my own faction couldn't. Ohhh....
---
Do it with you huh? 😏
---
&gt;someone made fun of me on the internet hes a bigot  
---
dude.
---
Nah preventing warp because you have a pvp dumber is mental, but sure cloak and warp whatever.
---
30.
---
Sure.
---
Yeah so, why should people that pay attention also suffer?
---
Same. No local without a structure. 15-30s delay with.
---
&gt; ridiculously overpowered rorqs (till recently)
---
They still are, by all metrics. There's multiple reasons why nobody is using exhumers. 
---
Until rorq balance gets decoupled from the ship's price tag, the rorq will always be overpowered.
---
You should scroll up, and check which one of us is mad at the world because he's not being properly rewarded for playing games all day like he used to be.
---
Because that's the nature of the fucking game? Like sometimes losing your ship is unavoidable. Maybe don't rat in a super, then? Jesus Christ I thought this was Eve Online
---
Waaaah I can't avoid losing my krabbing ship with absolutely brainless and 100% reliable counterplay, sooo unfaaaiir
---
&gt;  But I love Eve
---
I've been telling people this for months.
---
Olmeca is not actually retarded, he just loves EVE
---
looks like a fun player event fellas \o/
---
happy bday to vince and the bois

That was cheap in your serious moment about the metagame sodomizing you or whatever. I'm just a goofy joke. God's speed Olmeca

I think u/Doomchinchila has one

Blink twice if you're being threatened.

ok lets play, first phase of war vs raiden/white noise - supercarrier drone nerf from normals to fighters only, second phase of war vs raiden/white noise - tracking titans nerf raiden dies wn disbands, war vs n3 - slowcats nerf, cries for casinos and what not (you sick bastards took my poker away) after mittani makes his own casino - casinos get nuked out of the game regardless if they were honest businesses or rmters. Give me 8 hard nerfs that made goons lose wars right when they were fighting them.
---
ding ..... fucking clapping them ...... oooh that pod value... ding ding ....
---
Happy birthday!
---
lol no
---
&gt;The alliance wars and empire building have been some of the largest selling points for people to play eve since eve became a thing
---
Great.  Then you should have no trouble citing the last 3 articles about Eve that went mainstream news.  
---
Because they are not all about bloc wars and they are not recent.   Keep wearing blinders dude.  Your 5 upvotes is all you got riding the null bloc, blue doughnut, happy dance karma train.
---
This analysis is pretty much what I have been thinking. They should have done this 2 years ago.
---
Well clearly CCP doesn't share your vision of how Eve should be played and that they understand it can't be a hunters playground where ratters just get squashed with no chance to survive.
---
And that is where the problem is. Lack of vision and long term impact analysis. I keep saying this... CCP did some stupid moves based on goals that are probably financial and not health of the game based (well for anybody other than CCP those would be related, better money you make more you can put in your game to make it cool - we know it is not the case here, but I'm diverging) and now is desperately trying to very harshly compensate. Instead they need to do it properly with vision and proper evaluation of how it will evolve and affect the game. You can't make a PVE friendly environment for years and than turn 180 and make it almost impossible to do PVE ( except for a few entities and even those are struggling) in a couple of month span. Well you can, but the active login count will tell the story.
---
 They need to stop using a very low effort, rather large sledgehammer and start implementing profound, complex systems that take the game in the right direction and people will adapt and go into that direction because it is better/more fun/more efficient, not because they are forced. Give something that is enjoyable by all your "demographics" with as much interaction between them as possible. Just random examples but start making resources dynamic preventing over-harvesting and people will naturally spread minimizing umbrella support and making large entities easier to harass on the periphery. Make structures more expensive to run and remove any timers if they run out of fuel and people will stop spamming them EVERYWHERE. Add assets safety only to keepstars and sotyos and let the rest of the structure drop everything like poses did making everything that is not strategic still worth fighting for. Disallow industrial mode if there is another rorq in siege 100kms or more, so while you still don't completely stop multiboxing rorqs they are no longer clustered and you can force a defense fleet to need to split or warp around. And then give rorqs another useful role so the people that invested in tens of them don't feel cheated and will be able to sell them at equivalent price. Every problem mentioned above can have a decent, well thought, don't punch someone in the face solution which can be healthy for the long term of the game. And people better than me gave many other better solutions as well. But...
---
... you need to put effort into it. You can't just switch a system on/off or make a db change removing module permissions... And I don't think that that is something CCP wants or can do nowadays. So they just over-compensate for each stupid decision with equally moronic ones but much harsher short term so the player base reaction is equally abrupt. I honestly think that gradual, well thought, well explained following a clear goal that is obviously healthy for the game even if it is profoundly  PVP oriented would get community support from both carebears (who still need to see some ships explode so they have a reason to pve) and pvpers alike.
---
EVE Echoes
---
Its the lack of counterplay man. Cloaky ships got it too easy. If they werent around then I would agree with you. But BO became "if youre in a sub you can get tackled and killed without any chance". People didnt agree to it, I didnt and the newbies didnt either. It hurt them alot that they couldnt rat. 
---
And honestly, I personally dont mind newbies sitting in afk VNIs (rip). They wont break anything (economically) and Im happy if they get more isk than they need so they can use skill injectors to catch up to the rest of us.
---
But I would much much rather they actually went to LS first. If they fix that area it would be awesome. Cause NS is like you say, meant for people with more risk/isk. But unfortunately LS is shit atm so for many its either NS or not playing the game. It is by no means good for the game but we dont have options atm.
---
ia ma continuosly blinking  omg  feel horrified now
---
Lowest effort titan kill I've ever seen.
---
They have plenty of chances to survive, you're just a completely unimaginative smoothbrain that can't think of any counterplay beyond watching local.
---
It's pretty clear that "CCP's vision" for the game has been absolutely fucked for many many years and isn't getting much better, so I hardly think that's a good yardstick to measure by. Unless you think citadel spam and supercap proliferation have been really good for the health of the game?
---
Mad? More like stating the obvious. It's players getting old and wanting instant gratification from MMOs that ultimately kills them. You just want to buy your way to the end. "Buy your supercapital" with your real life money that you made at your awesome job. Even if it's just "Playing a video game" working hard to accomplish something feels good. Amazed I'm telling a grown human who has procreated something as simple as this. Has the MMO genre not gone downhill in your opinion? I think the data speaks for itself when every new release is a pay-to-win cash grab and I'll be honest I think people like you are part of the problem. Whales who claim they don't have time for the game but they want to pay their way into end game or high tier content. All you can do is dismiss the people who actually want to be good at the game and feel a sense of reward when they accomplish that feeling of being self sufficient. They're just "nerds to impress". Why do you still play this game? I'm guessing you hop on teamspeak with these nerds and talk about shit you've done in the game am I wrong? You're a hypocrite and you form very poor counter-arguments. Grow up. Better yet keep plexing, from the sounds of it you must have to buy a lot of it to sustain your horrible piloting skills.
---
I think I fixed it. The problem looks like it's in the directx/d3d implementation used in Wine. For my fix you need to update the d3d compiler.
---
1. Install Homebrew ([https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/))
---
2. From a terminal use Homebrew to install winetricks ( brew install winetricks )
---
3. Use winetricks to install d3dcompiler\_47 ( env="/Users/disrvptor/Library/Application Support/EVE Online/p\_drive/Local Settings/Application Data/CCP/EVE/SharedCache/wine/bin/wine64" sh winetricks d3dcompiler\_4 ) Note: replace /Users/disrvptor with your actual user directory
---
4. Remove d3dcompiler\_43 ( find "/Users/disrvptor/Library/Application Support/EVE Online" -name "d3dcompiler\_43.dll" -exec rm {} \\; ) Note: replace /Users/disrvptor with your actual user directory
---
I'm using the latest non-dev version of Wine, which I think the launcher uses 4.15.something. Let me know if this works for you and maybe CCP can update the libraries in their Wine branch.
---
Yep.  CCP keeps pandering to stupidity and making the game worse.  Which is why I haven't played in years.
---
Null blocs heard something they liked so they will cheer with a CCP vote brigade.  When they hear something they don't like they will protest with an anti-CCP vote brigade.
---
CCP will keep responding like Pavlov's dog.
---
"Should"
---
Very few bots left, they moved to highsec.
---
So what if dudes with a dozen rorquals come back?  That is how they want to play the game, and they are paying for the game time to do it.
---
They get money, I get ships, you get stuff to shoot.
---
CCP gets to keep running this shitty game.
---
ooof
---
Cocaine eyes look a lot like lsd eyes.

Way to move the goalposts. Most of those are bullshit as they had nothing to do with us. The supercarrier and Titan nerfs you mention hurt us, too. The casino was a confirmed RMT operation and CCP banned them because there was no reliable way to police them, as they existed mostly out of game. It also doesn't mean shit to us because we had already been evicted before the ban (if CCP were tilting the table in our favor, they wouldn't have waited dumbass). PL didn't just rub their slowcat nuts on us; they did it to everybody (and smugged so fucking hard about it that you were basically daring CCP to nerf them); but that's the closest one to a real thing. By my count, I owe you two game changes that hurt us more than our enemies. I'm giving you fou, in no particular order:
---
1) Nerfing AOE Doomsdays right after Goonswarm got its first Titan.
---
2) Jump fatigue, which was introduced when our empire was the largest in Eve. 
---
3)  GM Sunshine threatening to ban Remedial (CEO) because Goons were saying "fofofofofo" in local. 
---
4) Everything CCP Grayscale was ever known for.
---
Did I mention that t20 gave his ill-gotten T2 BPOs to BoB during our war against them?
---
Haha, teacup song?
---
Make an Alpha account and try it for a few weeks. You will not find that answer on the Internet or certainly Reddit.
---
Reality trains have no brakes.
---
&gt;They have plenty of chances to survive, you're just a completely unimaginative smoothbrain that can't think of any counterplay beyond watching local.
---
Lmao maybe take your own advice, have you thought that maybe if you need there to be no local just to have a chance to kill a super you aren't actually that good?
---
The lack of cynos possible with the incursion would fall into the lines current thinking.
---
I've always thought one of the best ways to fight post scarcity was upkeep costs. Specifically for big hulls and all citadels.
---
Obviously it would need to be fine tuned a shit ton but the minimal upkeep to run citadels is trivial. And owning a 10 mile space ship has zero costs associated with it.
---
This games old, and needs some major revamping.
---
&gt; But why?
---
Because the big blocs keep losing fights when they go caps vs bombers
---
Throw away spy is throw away.
---
Killing fleet warp would help with all the N+1 "tactics".  It should get harder and harder to manage larger and larger groups.  Fleet warp is one element that makes managing a large group easier, even in non-PVE situations.  Fleet members are perfectly capable of paying attention, and should be warping on command rather than waiting around to anchor and hit F1.
---
Though, you'd need an ability to set warp speeed to some value lower than your max so as to coordinate fleet arrival.  Otherwise, this is one thing that could help underdogs/outnumbered parties.
---
&gt; the current meta is to wear out your opponent till they just give up playing the game because they are tired of all the stupid ass structure and entosis pings
---
In fairness, the previous meta was to wear out your opponent with SBU blueball ops until they gave up. Wars in Eve have *always* been prosecuted on the level of linemember morale, or titan blob. "Blueballs or helldunks" isn't anything new, and neither is the Great Grind War. 
---
Ramble warning: Imo the only significant shift on this particular front comes from moving mining (rorqs) from highsec to nullsec. Smallgang content didn't used to be *relevant* on a strategic level, because it couldn't disrupt strategic operations (rorq mining to build titans). Now it can, and it's recognized and dealt with as a strategic threat. 
---
At the time, it seemed like a good idea; ~wulfpax~ can now be awesome, because even if your gang can't fight their supers, you can now kill excav drones and hinder their industry. The downside is this is what makes a newbro in a rifter gating through your sov a *key strategic threat* that must immediately be addressed with titans; while in 2014 you might have ignored it or fought it with your own frigates.
---
Nah maybe add cynos to a few more subs but definitely not revert them.
---
Again, with local, it isn't difficult to kill an attentive ratting super, it is *impossible*
---
But whatever dude, you're obviously a huge turbokrab that can't imagine life without the comfort of the citadel era. There's no reasoning with you.
---
Eh, i'd argue dotlans delta maps are a better source than dscan.
---
&gt; I'm glad someone -~~high enough~~ in CCP payroll looked at the numbers, and came to their senses.
---
FTFY
---
60 second delay on local. Give hunters a chance.
---
I am cautiously optimistic. Both from dev feedback, but also I think its unlikely WH space goes untouched, so im hoping I can steer it in the right direction.
---
All good I was a jerk to, we can be on opposite sides if blackout but still agreeing a middle road is probably better for the game.
---
It is. Teetotalers.
---
o7
---
I wont claim its 100% right, but i dont think its far off. Thats based on my own data of several hundred 5/6s I have mapped out ( some of which may be months old) and extrapolated over my missing data set. I ran it by people beforehand and everyone felt it sounded right.
---
Arazu, Rapier, Jaguar, Hyena. Bring these and you catch what alludes you. Bring a Sabre and an inty pilot who can decloak competently.
---
They were warped as they undocked, figure a few of thos ewere collateral
---
Why should an attentive ratter be easy to kill lmao have some imagination.
---
Make offensive sov less aids
---
Holy crap I stopped reading your comment after your first reply. I said “Most people didnt know what a HAC was” not HAC didn’t exist. The fact that you failed the first statement voided everything else you had to say afterwards. Fucking pleb.
---
TL;DR  
---
You have the FW playerbase telling CCP how to fix FW.  They never listen.
---
Better merch store options when?
---
We dont need your kind. We never did shuu shuu.

I thought it was sla is volume priced, so if you're print was largely hollow, you could get away with lower prices?

Come to wormhole space my friend. Need more jspace players/communities. I started wormholing within the first couple months of my eve career (only about a year or two ago) and haven't wanted to leave since. Find a decent sized group and absorb all the knowledge you can :)
---
Exactly.
---
There's a multitude of angles, but right now it seems like not only is there little incentive to take an offensive or nomadic stance, but its actively cumbersome. Which makes even less sense and its no wonder the game is stagnating because of it
---
&gt;  Yea you try fighting autocannon/HAM lokis
---
you'd have to find those autocannon and ham lokis first
---
That extra half-second pause really hurts.
---
No...you are actually trying to make people that are already your customers, often for &gt;10 years, and have stood the test of time, want to not hate the fricking game they liked.  
---
If CCP wants to make a new game...do it.  Make New Eden everything they want.  See how much luck they have attracting new people into a style of game that is total not what people want to buy these days.  They will not, because they can’t.  Better to use the IP for awful phone games than invest years and millions of dollars on a real MMO.  
---
Much much much better is to iterate, in a constructive way, and in a way that does not tank the fricking game, ways to try to make Eve better.   They can do this, with thought and effort.  They should also actually get new people to not leave in 7 days running and screaming.  This is the low hanging fruit that CCP has never had any interest or skill in doing in...well...forever.
---
First problem with modern players, they can’t read or comprehend shit.
---
Most player didn’t know what a T2 ship was doesn’t mean T2 ships didn’t exist. It literally means that we’re rarely flown by majority and players didn’t have the skills to fly them. You need to stay off the video games and stay in school. Or invest in some classes. At least pick up a book.
---
Borrow an time machine from somewhere and go to 2014'ish era.
---
Incompetent fcs
---
Ships blowing up isn't an isk sink. That isk they spent on the ships is just in someone else's pocket (you could argue slight isk sink in market fees but not the point), and if anything, getting blown up technically ADDS isk to the game in the form of insurance. It would more apt be called a resource sink
---
Must be one bitter pill for him to sallow.
---
Blackout would never result in enough destruction.  Large scale destruction occurs when there is a reason to fight and reasonable expectation of success. You offer nothing to attain that result.  You are full of shit.
---
You’re what we never wanted in the game in the first place. To call you a bot is to high of a status. Bots are bad and hurt the game. You are killing it.
---
Beyond 1 v 1, and small gang, FW on large scale died out when the Calmil - Galmil warzone finally ended.  When the major Calmil coalition disbanded and many major Galmil blocks left a few months later.
---
The weeks-long, unyielding system sieges, with hundreds of players across every timezone, with thousands of ships lost in the fray...
---
That chapter of FW seems to have closed.
---
You can already do that. Right click a player and select "duel".
---
This made me chuckle. Thanks!
---
Well, when it comes to ratting belt ratting is tricky to do in a dessie and we're happy to replace those for people, but its tough to turn positive - for those very new people who wanted to get out to null generally they see how tough belt ratting for profit is and rush a cruiser which is usually just barely on the breaking edge of "don't fly what you can't afford to lose" for many. So it's high risk for them even if they're in very cheap ships as far as the rest of us are concerned. We do try of course to hand out as many free ships as possible to help them get beyond this, but blackout absolutely increased the rate they were losing these ships.
---
They are not returning as they never left.
---
Great work. Thank you Exooki.  
---
Each slides and comments tells how you love wormhole spaces.  
---
My vote for you was not wrong.
---
Yeah knocking over someone's sand castle isn't worth the struggle.
---
wait when did we start talking about your posting
---
What was the announcement?
---
Dude is literally crushed.  
---
I wonder, if he's going to follow Guard's path...
---
I felt directly opposite, cyno changes are great, the blackout felt super hamfisted.
---
no, we need local so we can crab in safety
---
It's also worth noting that doing things to make your krabbing safer means directly reducing the amount of big fights &amp; wars you get. (blueing up the whole game, using max aids sovwar strategies, retreating from any fight you aren't 110% sure you'll win)
---
But on an alliance level, krabbing more -&gt; more supers -&gt; better chance of winning fights/wars. 
---
So if you wanna win wars, you gotta krab as much as possible, which means setting up the best possible krabbing environment. Which is an environment with the minimum possible fights &amp; chance of wars. 
---
In short, *The things that make you successful at winning fights/wars also make you not end up in fights/wars.* 
---
And we wonder why we don't get a lot of fights out of nullblocs anymore.
---
You understand that flying that annoying kite-y stuff takes more skill than brawling? You have to actually manually fly your ship during combat instead of just hitting orbit 500m button.
---
How will ded runners buy escalations with this new system?
---
I’d rather have skill injectors than waiting. A whole year before I can efficiently use a new character.
---
Increase build cost. 1bil+. This is the age of overflowing oak faucets yeah? Make it a decent sink!
---
One timer is good. Increase hp by a bit. Something that doesn’t need a full Ass fleet, but requires more than a couple dudes.
---
Proud to see Sm3ll still rolling along. Thank you all for continuing the dream! Love and miss you guys!!
---
Not going to lie... seeing u call people dumb and then dieing like this made me chuckle
---
&gt;It literally means that we’re rarely flown by majority and players didn’t have the skills to fly them.
---
That is not even true though...... its so false it hurts.  Almost every player knew what t2 ships were, interceptors in particular were very widely used.  HACS were also very popular at the time.  Well established = known and used.
---
Yes. I would rather they tweaked the inhibs or something. Or like spool up timer or whatnot. But just removing them is the same as with the BO, its just too heavy handed.
---
nah skill injectors just exacerbate every mistake ccp makes. Skill injectors were a mistake.
---
Invite pls
---
Dude it really does. I have already explained this to you. If you dont belive me just look at zkill. The cyno change is bad. Its the same as the BO, just a hammer.
---
F
---
That poor nestor didn't stand a chance.
---
What is that picture? Seems like a bird? A bee?
---
Your phrasing is just terrible, let me give it a go. Cynos are an exploit due to an unfair advantage with the incoming cap fleet.
---
Stick to reactions and less whining about WHs.
---
Perhaps just at or below a set amount.  If you have 400mil SP, I'm not sure this system would benefit you much, unless your goal was to simply back to your early days and see how life has changed.  But at the 100mil mark it would be a gamechanger.
---
It's a programming limit that would probably make citadels warpable.
---
...what?
---
Uh.  that isn’t the issue
---
When goons went north PL and friends just... left.  Used asset safety and packed up.
---
You don’t like that goons are in one region?  Get over that anyone can do that.  The issue is you CANNOT glass that region and do enough damage to keep them from just moving a little away
---
It was very fun, though i didnt get any loot.  Happy birthday SM3LL! GF had by all, though the bombers were aids.
---
Local has been in the game since the start.
---
How is it out of balance? Cause you can’t cloaks gank everything anytime you please?
---
Oh right that does seem unfair :(
---
Damn how dumb can you be? Literally, read wtf i said.
---
Or a Molok, in your CEO's case
---
&gt;No one is going to go and create content just for the sake of it because no one wants to risk their shiny toys for so little reward.
---
Take the shiny out.  3 tiers of sub cap plus capital-super-titan, is too hard to balance.  
---
I say one tier at a decent price, and delete supers-titans-fax.
---
I'm guessing that adding a delay to local chat code isn't an easy thing to do.
---
And we warped *uphill*, in the *snow* to get to Jita.
---
And next time they don't like some change they can just have a 2 week break from eve and ccp has to roll back changes. GF.
---
I mean... objective fights are a major content generator, and a timer lets people know when they need to go fight over the potential loot.
---
Problem is, it's not viable in any way to bring a subcap fleet on grid with NPC sotiyos, so attacking anyone running one is an exercise in suicide.
---
Breaking News: Jita local capsuleer gets podded in view of thousands outside IV-4  after offering to double isk. Concord Police Chief commented "For too long have we listened to the mindless dribble of isk doublers scammers and misleaders. Today we are withdrawing Concord forces from Jita and letting the people police themselves."
---
No word yet on whether capital ship bans would be upheld in Jita and the systems surrounding.
---
True that, my dude.
---
Very nice. 
---
Pretty much only in this game do people with bad "gear" (not optimised ships) and too few friends think they are deserving of killing stuff belonging to a much bigger, richer, and stronger group. Its such a joke that the thought is even entertained. You want blood, dig your own grave first. Not boosh around with your small gang thinking the game has stagnated because you cant kill titans without even putting caps on grid.
---
I mean even in WoW which these guys say everyone that thinks otherwise should go to will this happen. You try PvPing against someone with higher levels, better gear and more friends and youre dead, 10/10.
---
Please do not fix that typo
---
Signal cartel give them out anyway... And it's not that hard to get an alt in there and take the bms for self
---
Or you could "git good"
---
Yeah, isn't this the premise of every matchmaking game with a ranking system? Why not implement that.
---
Ah how could I forget, the two choices: impossible and easy.
---
The nuanced mind of a krab
---
I think farmholes are more complex than just good or bad. I  enjoyed running pve fleets and socializing with people as we ratted back when that was more common more than I do farming alone. That said, I want to spend as little time farming as I can, hence I do it solo. I would like to see PVE changes that may incentivize fleets more, without forcing people into that, so its more of a choice than it is now.
---
I may not have given myself justice in my notes, but we did talk about moon goo and several changes to WH materials and indutry, i mentioned it in the industry slide, but didnt go into details.
---
BS mass, and pyro were both discussed in other sessions in depth.
---
How are deep safes made? I get the incursion site ones but not in wormholes.
---
Theyre both bad ideas
---
remove local, buff nullsec
---
I remember when Singg was relevant.
---
Justice
---
that just turned one question into two
---
I made zero comparison to skill and zero offense intended
---
Indeed, this. They went for the lazy, ham-handed fix with little warning. What you describe could well have been a winning formula. But once burnt, they won't tinker again with local till 2025. If the game lasts that long.
---
&gt;People who saw Eve as primarily a PvP game with PvE as a supporting function left and people who played Eve for the PvE aspect who saw PvP as a casual F1 occurrence/nuisance multiplied due to the stabilizing/stagnating factors listed above.
---
Elite pvE and n+1 are the tag team of stagnation in null.  
---
I like your idea of constellation local, but unless CCP grows the balls to fight the blob, (and sacrifice some short term profits) Eve will continuously be on a 'down slope.'  
---
PvP was and must be again the core of Eve.  Bring PvP corps back.
---
Reduce structure times to only 1 reinforcement. Low power citadels have no timer and can be killed in one go.
---
Injectors are whatever
---
lmao stahp
---
see my idea was to replace all charnames with random strings of the trig alphabet. You have no idea if you're going up against the vydra AT team until you study your losses later on zkill. 
---
You could have a low &amp; high stakes version of the same thing, though; "limited to t1 ships and t2 modules" vs. "no limit abyssal hold'em"
---
Supers need almost double that. And its a highly skilled ship which requires tons of injectors if you go that route.
---
those tears are naise
---
The change to uniform reasources across the map killed the game. Why move when you can get everything you need in your area of space?
---
please explain
---
no you would be wrong, observatories are a terrible idea and weighted only towards defenders, full local has benefits to both attackers and defenders. for real just leave local alone.
---
Lol so much this. Current warfare is basically more about boring your opponent and breaking their will rather than actually killing them.
---
Just can't fix your kind of stupid.
---
* Nerf Citadels
---
* Nerf timezone Tanking
---
* Nerf indexes
---
Citadels are cancer as they are a massive safety bubble that basically only big coalitions and alliances are capable of attacking. Small alliances and corporations cannot be expected to engage in several weeks of fighting outside their TZ to take down a sub-par asset that actively prevents any form of other traditional methods harassing opponents like alpha fleets and hell camps on the undock
---
Timezone tanking is cancer as above. Staging one operation to siege a pos to get into the right TZ or, worse case scenario, get it into a weekend timer out of TZ that you could alarm clock for was managable. Having to rally people outside your TZ during a weekday while they're at work over the course of weeks doesn't work and if it does; they can just put down another for almost no cost.
---
Indexes are anti-thesis to everything that the old mechanics worked under. You kill a bunch of pirates and more valuable / numerous pirates appear? You mine a bunch of ore and more profitable and bigger asteroids appear? In wormhole space, before the blue donut, if you killed every site in the system it would randomly spawn in another system of the same constellation. This resulted in krabbers leaving a single frigate still alive so that it would respawn at downtime and thus raiders would have to enter your system and do the sites to make them spawn in their system. This created skirmishes, war and such between parties living in the same constellation.
---
Pirates should be moving away from highly active systems and, arguably, in the current game be more dangerous. DED sites would be revamped so that it's riskier with more warp disruption, webifiers and ewar to counter with A.I that prioritises the site runner and not the hunter. 
---
Farming resources, isk, modules, ect should feel more like an expedition or co-ordinated effort from corporations and groups of players like it did before. Popping the battleship spawns in old EVE would piss ratters off, now they just get a bunch of spawns for their 24/7 carrier ratting regardless of what the enemy does bar sitting in system 24/7.
---
Black out and loss of local didn't encourage fights and hunting. Maybe people talk about their successful blops drops or being able to snag someone in a fast solo ship, but this isn't the pinnacle of EVE pvp. Blackout had an increase in PVP because zkill blacked out and people couldn't tell who was a cyno alt or such anymore.
---
Finally, eve needs more progression. For players who fly every ship and large groups; there needs to be bigger objectives in the game to achieve indivually and as a collective.
---
I would argue that the group that got alienated did the exact same thing to the other group as well. See I remember the days of certain groups using their pvp leetness with caps beating on anyone and everyone and telling people to adapt or gtfu.
---
I currently play in NPC null and the only thing blackout did for me was cause the loss of a few Asteros and epithals because that's all the leet pvp bois would engage. If I was doing anoms or Ded Sites they didn't come near my ship because that might be a risk to their ship or shiny green KB.
---
 Personally BO was a bit extreme the could have made it so you weren't visible for some variable of minutes and that would have allowed hunters to hunt and it would have allowed PVE people so level of minor security to work with.
---
Indeed
---
While I do agree that smaller corps can adapt faster its also an issue of how hunted they are. Blocs get hunted alot, arguably more since the BO. Smaller corps can adapt to a point but if this had gone on long enough then the blocs would have eventually adapted. And people would fall back to farming smaller groups again.
---
If by "local cloak delay" the person who is cloaked also doesn't get local until they cloak then it's still not as good as full local but less cancer than full blackout. If they get to see who's in system whilst remaining out of local themselves that would be horribly broken.  
---
as for the cyno thing, the entire cyno change misses the whole point, they should keep it as it was before maybe stop corvettes from lighting them sure but everything else should be left alone. The actual issue is people dropping supercapitals on subcaps, literally just make it so super carriers and titans can't shoot subcaps et voila problem solved people will have to respond with subcaps or far easier to kill normal caps. Also delete Titan AOE DDs.
---
I see im right on track with your phrasing.
---
Just take away local everywhere, but add it to WHs.
---
Yeah + more if you actually wanna make money without dying
---
"1 unit of content per 100 hours of gametime" is just not a lot of *fun* (for the pilot or the hunters), and maintaining it requires exceedingly safe space. Since most hunting works on the theory of "if you get caught you 100% die" this translates to nothing happening 99% of the time. 
---
If we had ships that paid for themselves in 30 minutes but died every hour, we'd at least have readily-available fast-paced content instead of "wait another 2 years maybe PL will declare war on us again and we'll get to form up and then let them stand down and disband because we have twice their titan numbers."
---
It's almost as if its bad for people to have fun in a way that a certain waffle flair poster doesn't like.
---
Actually adapt or die and htfu started back with leet pvp bois for the record. It just got thrown back at you and ya'll didn't like it and the minute ya'll could use it again you did.
---
It's pretty clear from their faces when they talked about turning the Blackout off, that they're not too excited to be doing so.
---
The only reason they are is b/c there are too many sissy cry babies who can't live without being able to krab in peace and safety knowing there's no scary faces in Local with them.
---
Hell yeah revert the cyno changes, focus on the real problem of Supercapitals being able to interact with subcaps.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;3A. Null Bloc Leadership - just take a look at this KM - SPOILER they were all blue together  
---
&gt;[https://zkillboard.com/kill/78341272/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78341272/)
---
yes cause using a killmaill for a citadel taking the piss out of the major null blocks by combining them all, is a good example of all the null blocks "being blue together"  
---
you realise lots of people enjoy/care about getting green on their killboards and a 5bill unaligned cit is a good enough reason for everyone to just ignore each other and getting some killboard whoring in.....
---
the observatory idea is a terrible meme, it's heavily stacked in defenders favour, full local can be used both ways, full local was fine. as for the dumb perfect intel meme, if they want to fix the problem of people being able to be afk and just listen out for the alarm from near2 they could just make it so the client only logs the chat channels with a delay so stuff like near2 would become defunct you would actually have to be there paying attention to see if there was anything coming for you.
---
Null alway had local
---
There has to be degrees of it. Local is really important for groups that don't have umbrellas so they can't super rat/mine with rorquals.
---
With how fast blobs gangs/covert lokis kill any subcap that is tanked against rates, the only option is to avoid them, and you need local for that.
---
no fuck off, local is fine as it originally was. Observatories would be hella imbalanced towards defenders. instead introduce a delay to the chat logging so things like near2 become defunct
---
Thats a yikes from me dawg
---
Most def, most def. Like the entire reward system needs to be revamped and thereby the ships used for the use. But I honestly dont know if it could be pulled of. Or maybe Im just not confident enough in CCPs ability. Idk. But I do like your ideas though.
---
Think Ive just become too bitter to actually have relevant input on things.
---
no fuck off
---
&gt; Blackout was super fun.
---
For you, maybe. But in my corp alone 3 FCs (two of them well-known incursion FCs, and another who's an alliance-level skirmish FC) announced they were quitting the game soon after CCP announced the  cyno changes. Once the cyno changes went into effect, log-ins dropped off a cliff. Thursday night in USTZ there were never more than 50 people in Eso Standing fleet and lest you think that was simply because no one was joining standing because Rorqs and supers were docked and there'd be no saves, there were probably less than 100 people in alliance Mumble for much of the night. TEST is the second-largest alliance in the game, for fuck's sake. You couldn't look at that situation and say things were on the right track.
---
The whole PVE-v-PVP argument as framed on r/eve is absurd. The logic of the situation was that there was going to be an absolute reduction in PVP even if player numbers stayed constant because if you don't have the materials to produce new ships or the ISK to buy them, risk-aversion to taking fights and even undocking will rise sharply over time. As the saying goes, no bucks, no Buck Rogers.
---
And while it's nice to say blackout increased the uncertainty of intel, that wasn't really true. Interlopers were still spotted and reported. It didn't have much effect on promoting cooperation that I noticed, and the initial enthusiasm for setting up defensive gatecamps wore off in 10 days or less. 
---
Blackout and cyno changes don't address the real issue: The game's 16 years old and has a 16-year-old UI that might've worked well in the days when dial-up still passed for high-speed connectivity in a lot of places, but nowadays is an absolute negative for getting free exposure through YouTube and Twitch. The most popular Eve streamer is likely BjornBee, who as of this writing has 25,388 followers. His World of Tanks equivalent is QuickyBaby, who has 374,635 followers. And it's not like WoT Is anywhere near the most popular game on Twitch. Right now 87 people are watching Eve on Twitch. There are 2,259 watching Microsoft Flight Simulator X -- which is, in fact, a dead game no longer supported by its publisher.
---
I did not think about that. Great advice!
---
&gt;The only reason they are is b/c there are too many sissy cry babies who can't live without being able to krab in peace and safety knowing there's no scary faces in Local with them.
---
Quit acting naive. The numbers don't lie. You can pretend to whine about 'wow' or 'bots' or 'summer,' but if you care about the game, you should be able to see that while it might have benefited your playstyle, it killed it for many others. And you need all those styles to keep Eve healthy.
---
Way too late to that game, friend :)
---
If you kill 25 rorqs in a row do you earn a tactical nuke?
---
Happy birthday my favorite pandas!
---
K162s still don't "spawn" :)
---
Lol.
---
I'll call BS. CCP could have made local delayed by some minutes and both sides would have had a middle ground compromise. But I guess that was to hard for the LEET pvp bois to understand they wanted cheap, easy and risk free ganks and they got them for a few months.
---
I quit well before skill injectors but they're the major reason I never even gave it another try when alpha accounts came out.  Before then it actually meant something having SP and you had to actually work towards a goal.  I feel like skill injectors just exacerbated issues of newer people buying characters they weren't ready for, which is to say they jump into a bling ship and immediately proceed to get it blown up.  I honestly think it's worse than lootboxes because at least bullshit lootbox gambling gives you something, whereas buying shit with GTC's can just get everything flushed down the drain.
---
Oh fuck off.
---
&gt; It's fairly obvious that local is pretty vital to nullsec. 
---
lolololololol
---
Bull*shit*.
---
Must be a dead alliance to fall for this
---
HTFU ... They had local back in 2005... Maybe use your brain to get kills; it worked thoughout eve history 
---
Or fuck off into a wormhole; shut up with your CCPLSSS gimme free ganks to feel special ...
---
This video would be better if it had Villy  bosoning friendlies
---
Na. But this make it harder to implement good changes. Which was my biggest concern with the age of chaos. And it should have been others as well.
---
But its by far not over.
---
Or you just try to tackle him when he lands in the next site?
---
&gt;Most player didn’t know what a T2 ship was
---
 False
---
&gt;  It literally means that we’re rarely flown by majority and players didn’t have the skills to fly them. 
---
False, 2 years from introduction to your chosen point in time is well more than required to train and fly anything in the t2 roster.  Interceptors were again extremely popular. 
---
That is everything you said, the rest was just insulting me, you are incorrect on both counts.
---
lol how about no.

If you autopilot a freighter you deserve it

What If Goons Stopped Posting And How It's Good For EVE
---
It was easier to flash form in the same system as some entity just a station away. You had utility slots on the POS and frickin proximity mines.

Elo is an awesome FC, but can you please stop repeating your commands 738654 times.

Because you can flag exempt when logging in during ewarp. He was in fleetwarp when his client loaded.
---
Think you overdosed on the Mitten's cool-aide.
---
It was mostly full of people pinging to kill the bombers. Post fight comms were filled with hindsight. "Whoops. Shoulda had a single fax or two on grid. Guess we will know better next time".
---
Good kill though. Well played.
---
I agree
---
I love you now, you know that!
---
But Mittani was actually quite outspoken in favor of the BO in the beginning. Check the INN shows.
---
nah, local is a cancer and it's too good of an intel tool to be available
---
u better have a replacement levi ready
---
or else bbtb is gonna bully u
---
Null has always had the same rough risking it from the very beginning.  Before citadels you had pos towers.  Unlike Wormhole space where there are very few entrances and exits to any system and none predictable, Mass regions Can be cloaky camped and directly accessed by a single hunting group.  The balance between the PVP and in the PVE had tipped too far.  It was impossible to assess risk.  Let's see if the new changes with limited cynos still puts capitals at a disadvantage, but not one that makes every single capital and T2 ship obsolete for PVE.
---
Looking forward to it.
---
Hookbills are incredible in numbers. Make them long range / Nano and they just outrun anything and outrange anything.
---
Yeah. Eve is not other games. It’s a very specific niche. I’m sorry that the mighty blob that is test lost motivation to protect their ratting space via gate camps etc. Blackout rejuvenated many of my groups desire to play. But... it’s two different play styles. So... kinda hard to please everyone.
---
Some people might be sleeping
---
Can I get some context
---
Reeeeeeee I sold 4400 plex 2 weeks ago at like 3.3
---
I don't think they're really listed anywhere (from a quick Google search). You have the one dimension given in the ship previews ingame, the "long axis" (which I think is considered to be the longest axis of the ship, which would be height for FAXes).
---
* Apostle = 4,600 m
---
* Minokawa = 4,684 m
---
* Ninazu = 4,217 m
---
* Lif = 4,067 m
---
Besides that, you might just have to make a rough guess/calculation for length and width. Personally I'd screenshot each FAX in the desired orientation (facing the front for width, facing the side for length/depth) and use an imaging software such as GIMP (free!) to measure in pixels and calculate from there.
---
For example: from a screenshot of the front of an Apostle I measured the height to be 512 pixels, so if 512 pixels = 4,600 m then 1 pixel = about 9 m. I then measured the width to be 219 pixels which would be about 1,968 m.
---
Sorry if that's not exactly what you want, but I'm not sure where else you'd get that unless I didn't see it so...!
---
This is the problem CCP has, there addressing the security around the problem, but not the problem them self's. the security around the problems where all play built system to help defend them while playing the problem.  
---
we really need Conflict based pve,  where npc's are weak enough to easily kill but smart enough to run when under risk. warping to a ping when there low on hp having logi's e war  webs and points on grid not just row's off bs's.  
---
maybe have more then one faction on field so your working with other faction to take or defend the anom.   
---
E.G  you warp into a haven and find and amarr of khanid  attack force assaulting the hiding gate and pick a side ever you push off the blood raider's or join the defense.  
---
This could even  go as far as having  then forces respond to what you bring on field, bring in a myrm and the hostile side brings in more smaller ship around battle cruiser size to run you down. maybe even ship's to deal with the drones.  
---
Bring in a titan and the hostiles drop a interdiction wing and a pair off there own super's "maybe even a full on npc dread bomb if you have pissed them off enough."   
---
All in all this would make this all the more dynamic  and more pvp like, rather then endless waves off the same shit with no though going into them by the npc's.
---
Curiouser and curiouser, I reverted my changes and I can get warp to initiate if I click a button to warp and then minimize the window. This leads me to believe it's a race condition somewhere. Also, if I add some tracing (like +wgl) to WINEDEBUG then I am also able to get into warp albeit slowly.
---
Context please
---
Ive been playing on off for 12 years and just hit 130M SP and feel retarded at this game.  And yeah sometimes I wish I could shuffle SP around once a year like the remaps.  Skill injectors arent worth it with this much SP.
---
If You zoom in it looks like a cocksickle.
---
simple.  
---
it near impossible to drag people out off there titans and super's when its easier to just use them to make isk and rely on some one cynoing in to help.  
---
ive seen so meany problem in just getting people on the titan Bridger with tackle, they rather just jump to a cyno and bap the red dot's then go on patrol  fleet's hunting the hunter's.
---
I lost a few brain cells from reading this one
---
They were getting bullied so hard by the massive nullsec blob that is Rekking Crew.
---
Now they will be able to fight the establishment and make a name for themselves!
---
/s
---
&gt; It would also buy Pearl Abyss the good will of the player base as it pivots take direct control of the game.
---
You're grossly overestimating the optimism of this sub.
---
When did I ever say non blackout was perfect, gosh get a grip.
---
Stop projecting your need for the game to be easier for you on me.
---
Something here doesn't add up
---
Lol you're fucking impossible to talk to.
---
I said catching attentive ratting supers with local is impossible.
---
You seem to think I believe it should be easy (I don't)
---
Now who the fuck knows what you're going on about.
---
You have a seriously childlike grasp of written language dude. This is a waste of my time.
---
Queue the explosion of massive wh noobie alliances.
---
(I think that would actually be a really good thing)
---
Agreed that nullsec rewards are weak and safety is too strong, that's why I think a blend of truly delayed local and zero local is a good compromise.  When I say cloak timer I mean the whole timer, not just when they warp and decloak.  A hunting group that is on top of their shit should be able to get to anom and grab point light covert cyno in that time.  Likewise a group who is in coms and in standing fleet can say "tackled in Haven in 1DQ(yeah right)" and either they get saved or people say sorry you are dead
---
How much easier will it be when it’s constellation based chat, and you just dock up when someone enter constellation. 
---
Region chat would be better
---
Here's an idea, everyone loves ISK, make random long-term (ie. Month-2month) events in NPC null that are super easily farmable but offer a constant opportunity to earn ~3x as much ISK as just sitting in your own space rorqual mining or super krabbing. 
---
That way, better game design than punishing krabbers who just sit still - instead, it rewards risk-takers
---
Hopefully you understood bit more why pvp oriented players have wanted these changes and this wasn't total waste of time.
---
No more blackout come Monday.
---
They were announcing no more blackout come Monday.
---
As if Pearl stepping in wouldn't be the instant end of EVE. They'd gut the fish and throw away the remains.
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that certain ship command skills should *only* be something you can train the old-fashioned way. In my opinion, it should be impossible to apply skill points to the racial Tactical Destroyer and Strategic Cruiser skills, as well as the Advanced Spaceship Command skill and all skills that require it: Jump Freighter, Capital Ships, Capital Industrial Ships, and all racial Freighter/Dreadnought/Carrier/Titan skills. Implementing this would make it so that skill injectors can be used to expand a character's capabilities in what careers they can do, what ships they can fly, what modules they can use, but they *cannot* be used to give anyone more capital ship pilots.
---
If CCP wanted to kill off the capital ship proliferation *completely*, then they could refund all skill points injected into those skills and make people train them back the slow way. But that would probably lead to The Mittani ordering everyone in the Imperium to stop playing EvE until CCP undid the changes, so it's obviously never going to happen.
---
Then the game should just die and be done already, the 'only play to farm and when im 100% safe" crowd were killing the game slowly anyway, sub numbers were dropping well before this, the game slowly circling the drain.
---
Acting like EVE was healthy before they turned off local means you're a fucking idiot.
---
5 minute delay, reducable to 1 minute with sov upgrades would be balanced, as long as u can reliably interrupt the upgrades
---
Suggestion: Shove it up your anus
---
Thanks for the birthday brawl! Had a ton of fun!
---
i think maybe we restrict asset safety to large or bigger. maybe just keeps and sotiyos. or just makes them less aids. and sov less aids. like, really, id almost rather poke my eye out than do a protracted sov and structure campaign.
---
People don't want their shit blown up, imagine that galaxy brain concept.
---
n+1 is basic physics.
---
Nowadays you can do the exact thing with literally any smartphone
---
We're all bots, we've been found out
---
one of them is very tall or the other very short
---
I stop reading when you called for hilmars head. That would be a very bad thing for eve. I can guarantee that if a new leader came in all of our ships would be wearing micro transaction hats faster then you can imagine.
---
goons alone outnumber WH and actiive pvp hs corps.
---
It took a drastic downturn during implementation. That can't really be denied...
---
Awesome!
---
i think that's the issue eve is having... ageing playerbase...
---
CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAB PEOPLE CRAAAAAAAAAAAB PEOPLE
---
Fuck it v0v
---
JEE CHRI
---
Everyone that played in the AT already quit my dude
---
they suck tho. paper tank at best
---
That was the desired effect :-)
---
what is contested sov had no local? or something anchorable that removes local
---
It amazes me every day when I see you post that you didn't forget to breath because you're so stupid.
---
&gt; I suspect the entire premise of ratting and mining anomalies will need to go, replaced by some sort of very different activity.
---
I really don't think you could reconcile subcap PvP build philosophies with the current ratting anomaly implementation.  It's like trying to sprint your way through a marathon.
---
He's a mega carebear.
---
hrm... you sound like a pubbie wormholerBTW that's never actually lived in null and knows littele about what it's actually like
---
Sure, but you're arguing between a dying game and a dead game, why does it matter the end result is the same either way.  
---
Getting your ultra safe play style stretches the game another year or two where literally nobody does anything and sub numbers keep dropping because you've all made the game so fucking safe that nothing happens or its dead by Christmas because a little risk got injected.  
---
I like excitement and fun when I play, so if the game must go i'd rather she go out kicking and screaming in a flash rather than kept on some weak ass life support so you can all play space farm simulator.
---
&gt; If you could, for example, rat for 300m/hr in a 100mil cruiser
---
Suddenly I'm concerned about inflation becoming a bigger problem.  We want to afford losses easily enough that we can farm for PvP instead of farming to replace ships lost while farming, but how do we keep ships from becoming more expensive and recreating the problem?
---
&gt;But CCP has had plenty of opportunities to fix things. Instead they opted to pursue boondoggle after boondoggle to develop titles that never made it to market. The time of CCP is over. The Time of Pearl Abyss has come.
---
imagine if the developers actually developed the game over the last 6 years
---

nothing is better than shaming the shitbags
---
Awesome video! 
---
So question and this may be frowned upon by some but can someone put some videos with hip hop over a fight like this? I rarely if ever have seen any rap used for Eve engagements (yes I know copyrights etc etc) and some wouldn't mind seeing  oh I don't know maybe A$AP Ferg, Kendrick, or something hype other than EDM over it. I love EDM don't get me wrong but I figured for those that have quality recording programs/skills to be maybe toss some rap out there!
---
Just a request, Thanks.
---
Well it's obvious that you want the game to die sooner, and I'd rather it die later. Maybe dynamic blackout would work better. Not sure how it'd work.
---
Like...
---
&gt;...because you went to **NULLSEC**. 
---
Are you capable of **READING**?!
---
My comment was *one* line!! Two sentences!!!
---
---------------
---
It's about risk management. All of eve is about risk management. 
---
Risk -&gt; Reward. 
---
 * Highsec: low risk, low reward
---
 * Nullsec: high risk high reward.
---
Highsec is your Call, Nullsec is your All In.
---
Is that such a difficult concept?
---
Its funny and sad to see this. When the black out happened folks expected the "krabs" to just deal with it, adapt and keep playing in null (meaning "sit there and be a killmail for people").
---
Now it's "im unsubbing!!!! Have fun in your mining game".
---
Why not just adapt and keep playing. Or are you saying you honestly can't understand that you are responding like the "krabs" did?
---
You want an ingame memorial to this guy's death but downloading the game is just a step too far?
---
Make a friend, hop on the test server and do 1v1s .
---
How do you gut that which alreay has been gutted
---
Let me put it this way, the chances of EVE getting better with the current CCP is 0
---
The chances of EVE getting better with a top down purge is 0.02%
---
" So many hate blackout and so many hate local. But can’t we have a compromise? "
---
I hear this is like wormholes , perhaps you should check that out
---
Maybe, just maybe, thats on CCP for making caps the best solution to everything.
---
both
---
Definite up-vote for a good story
---
This is what Ratting should be... it shouldn’t exist in its current form imo
---
He might be talking about hi sec. Even so,NO. You are dumb stop posting.
---
Wooo, that was definitely one for the record books!
---
Thanks Knerf, Mercie, and the other directors and friends that set this whole thing up so we could have a party with our brotatos/brotato-ettes. It took a LOT of work and ISK, but 3 hours of ear-to-ear grins and 10 or 11 deaths was so much fun for me. MAHALOS!
---
Just to put this in perspective, EvE Online launched on May 6, 2003.
---
2003.5.06 to 2003.7.30; that's less than *three months* for the first "EvE is Dying" post to grace the official forums.
---
&gt; PvE ships can't fight, relying on either warpout or backup. They take so long to pay for themselves (supers are like, what, 30 hours of ratting? more?) that dying is catastrophic for your efficiency. 
---
That's actually not true.
---
I can rat in a T1 frigate and make back it's cost in 20 minutes or less.
---
But people want big payouts **AND** efficiency. And that's having your cake and eating it too.
---
Space is a problem, because people have so much space to hide in and do what they want. It's cool from a "oh it's so big" perspective, but it doesn't force pvp.
---
I can confirm this. We love to help!
---
what
---
Um, yeah. That's totally me. I've literally done that over a dozen times. Can't dock anywhere. I mighhhht come back later. Just gonna grab a sammich and a quick nap - safe spot &amp; cloak. Done. :D
---
&gt; The question is how does CCP accomplish this?
---
By actually working
---
oh wait
---
They were huge news when they first came out but I haven't heard a thing about them pretty much since, every so often I used to check zkill for ♦ sotiyo kills and they were getting sniped by a handful of supers, looks like they are just getting killed by a few dreads now, barely seems worth planning an op to kill those especially if they wreck subs that badly.
---
I'm not taking the nullsecer side of this, but you're making it sound like farmholes / ratting in wormhole space is risky, when it's honestly probably the most profitable ISK/hr in the game in terms of ratting and quite safe. Yes, you'll be rolled in on now and again but the damage done to you is far outweighed by the ISK gained over the course of the holes life.
---
You talk about logoff traps from bonus wavers: that is exceptionally rare.
---
You've also called out probably the only two corps who have C6 statics who reliably roll it for content - very few people live in X/C6's and/or chainroll them for content because of the threat of HK and the rentee-coalition willing to evict people to defend their renters.
---
Shoutout to Dead Star Syndicate for being one of the few corps living in a C6 who actually do shit there. We should be aiming for C6 space to be inhabited by the strong corps (Inner Hell, HK, etc - the ones you listed) as opposed to 90%+ renter/farmholes.
---
Actually I've been in your alliance for a while. Also don't call people "pubbie" you sound like a massive twat.
---
XD Mr big brain over here can't even catch a super. Get gud lmao
---
You really should biomass irl.
---
Nobody feels “pitty.”
---
Remove names from local but have a player count number.
---
No fuck off
---
Yeah because bypassing enemy space, finding a target, planning an attack, is "cheap free easy ganks" for low IQ retards that can't stay aligned and push ONE button to get to safety.
---
They also fill their games with cash shops with in-game benefits.
---
Post lossmail
---
These people belong in high sec clearly.
---
Too bad these trashy players who aren't cut for being in nullsec destroys the game by crying about great changes because it ruins their ISK printing.
---
It's just to fill empty chatter and keep people paying attention, most people are retarded.
---
All I hear is Rreeeeeeeee
---
I just don’t want to play in a game where the top players are those who have 10 mining account going.  I don’t care to adapt in that way.   Has been getting harder and harder to pvp in small gang over the years due to many changes in game.   I thought ccp was going to change that.  Guess I was wrong.  Just going to unsubscribe my accounts for a while and vote with my wallet like everyone else has in the last two months.  I’ll check back in after a while perhaps.
---
no u
---
Sad days upon us
---
all i hear is "I want to play farmville in space"
---
Says the guy who cant post on his main.
---
Local by itself without killboards or intel tools or other 3rd party softwares? Yeah, pretty harmless. Combine local with zkill, near2, and whatever the fuck else some programmer made to identify neutrals in your space makes local pretty powerful.
---
Who set eso green this time?
---
wow gotem!  
---
its ok i know its not your fault you're too stupid to actually think critically about a proposal/idea and just have to say "REEEEE" to every criticism of CCP
---
There are a lot of dumb posters on here, but you my man, might be the dumbest.
---
Honest question - whats it like when you realize 1) its a tarp 2) you are going to die.
---
Do you get a huge rush of emotion or do you just say "f it, ill buy another"
---
&gt; Hilmar is universally reviled by the player base at this point.
---
Reddit and the playerbase are not the same thing. Most of r/Eve hasn't subbed in years.
---
I do man. I was never on the "other" side. I have always been on the games side. My intention will always be whats best for the game because I myself enjoy all aspects of the game. I want others to be able to feel the same so most def. I will keep what youve told me in mind.
---
Wut
---
I still have yet to see any of these null tears you guys keep talking about. Pretty much everybody likes the blackout.
---
The price dropped that much!!!! WTF IVE BEEN AFK FOR LIKE 2 weeks
---
Exactly no balls to see it through.

oof

&gt;SNUFF spy burned his alt to kill two titans

that's what i call utilizing a spy effectively

Overall the only big conflict is between Legacy(TEST) and Winter Coalition (Fraternity). Which mostly happens in chinese prime time or a bit later due to the fact that Fraternity is a chinese group.
---
Also create social contacts (also called friends) who might tell you about things going down.
---
&gt;Should I connect with big corporations and offer my salvaging runs like I would sell for a business? Like they pay me a certain amount to 'clean up' and I'll be on my way, doing just that, etc.
---
I doubt that big groups will do that with any outsider. They either don't bother or organise that stuff themselves.
---
&gt;I plan to write articles, like a mini blog about my encounters, and, I was wondering how I could get people to subscribe so I can have a few viewers for my first article? It'd have pictures, a sound file and a text body. Is this possible?
---
Just link your new articles here. People are into such things especially if it's well written. You can also submit such pieces to one of the news sites I linked above.
---
&gt;Last dumb question: Old School Runescape has a client you can download for Plugins, like Runelite, is there anything like that for this game? If not dont worry, I wasnt planning to cheat. Just looking for some minor QOL things for my UI/in-game controls
---
There are many third party applications to make your life easier: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Third-party_tools
---
Manipulating the client itself is against the EULA though. This is to reduce the possibilities of cheating.
---
I’m pretty sure Kunmi just has spares :)
---
Are you referring to nullsec incursions and NPC sotiyos? Or did you have something more in mind?
---
Two titans are not worth anything in the grand scheme of things. If his was pulled off correctly a lot more supers could have been killed. 
---
Sloppy job.
---
Delayed local to 5/10min ish would still let time to hunter to go out and hubt will giving locals delayed intel, but yeah the krab won
---
Hey I already did this thread yesterday !! 
---
But hell fucking yeah, this is exactly the balance we need. I started feeling bad for the gilas and myrms one of my t3s would randomly gank..it’s not how the games meant to be. Likewise, going back to the complete safety of sov space is dumb dumb dumb. The naive side of me assumed Blackout was going to lead to something different, a middle ground or such.
---
This. I like this idea alot. Give us observatories that even the best super mega upgraded high adm system gives local but with lets say a 2m delay maybe next level down a longer delay or access to a 2m delay constellation chat. Lowest with upgrade x min delayed regional network. No upgrade black out
---
Weird, cause it looks like a guy discussing balance from both sides of the argument...

Why are you all so obsessed with relentlessly kicking over  sandcastles? Sandcastles are fun to build and create. They are why I enjoy this game. Sure start a war if you want, but be willing to work hard. War should be risky and should drain time and resources. War is not easy. Don't go crying that the devs need to make it easier for you to knock sandcastles over. If you want an FPS game, then go play an FPS game. This is a sandbox/world builder game. No one wants to play in a sandbox with a bully standing over your shoulder ready to knock your stuff down.
---
black was desired, i loved the direction, ccp cannot for the life of them figure out how to implement anything anymore,      all the chaos stuff should of been done with one big expansion sell it to the masses this way,  what we got was some media publication and well wishing..   
---
sad its now a massive miscalculation for stuff that ccp really needed to have been sucessful about 
---
its just all too late
---
Added clarity LOST THIER BALLS
---
Could implement rolling blackouts(blame it on drifters of w/e), where regions(or even better, areas of the map(part of multiple regions) go into temporary blackout.  Different changing areas at random, for 30 minutes to several hours to several days.
---
Ideally, this would block out map info such as active players in last 30, and outside intel like dotland.  Concord simply lost connection with the area and is trying to fix it.  When they do, voila.
---
I think problem #1 and something that as a business CCP cannot fix, is ALTS. Eve is a social game that people want to play alone with alts. Cyno alts rorq alts cap alts on and on. Omega or not, you should be allowed to have 1 character logged in per up, period.      
---
Though completely agree with everything else. Null blackout should have remained. More should be done to shake things up. I honestly did not expect them to end the blackout.
---
probably best idea about null local
---
We have reached the point were warcraft classic players are more hatdcore than us.
---
&gt;Two titans are not worth anything in the grand scheme of things.
---
neither is 50 in eve tyool 2019, it's the fact that they did it to kill them in 1dq
---
and a throwaway spy is ez pz to get in any imperium alliance
---
&gt;http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/The\_Forge#kills map which gives you data like in this case kills in the last hour. Might help to see a big battlefield.
---
this one is really useful
---
There was chat about anchorables that would give Local, Observatories I think - it may have just been player speculation though.
---
I enjoyed the blackout.  But, as a smaller alliance in npc null, our miners docked up.  Before they did, Lowsec people were coming to fuck with our miners with bombers.  At that point we went on pvp roams more.  It...was rather empty.  Very small fights were found, but not much.  Lowsec has more fights to be had, but us jumping into system had people getting out of our way too.  
---
Overall, imo, bring the blackout at random to different areas(not regions) for limited time at random.  THAT would be sweet.
---
Lurker here and former player, fill me up and fill me in.
---
The same could be done to horde, test and any other alliance, because lol injectors.
---
If your game is spiraling downhill, does keeping things the same seem the correct way to fix it?
---
I don’t think Einstein would agree.
---
That just makes everything more annoying, everyone will easily have these everywhere so what’s even the point
---
Yup, this is the truth of it...Eve was always meant to be a hardcore game, if that can no longer be achieved for whatever reason then I’d say it’s time is done.
---
Observatories would just provide local to the sov holders? Serious question, I don’t know much about them.
---
Make local a function of dscan. Open hailing frequencies or ship-to-ship.
---
Make them have fuel, or no rienforcement timer.
---
Yeah i really dont get how people didnt understand that this is the whole point of why blackout didnt stay.
---
Aye, that’s one of the best I’ve heard so far.
---
Reinstate blackout. Local should be IHub upgrade. It should have some substantial trade-offs.
---
Keep asset safety at status quo for everything which can dock in an NPC station. For anything which can't, have it either drop as loot or automatically be destroyed.
---
Rework sovereignty to make it less worthwhile to control huge areas of the map. As an alliance sprawls, the amount required to keep each index up should scale. This should not be the only change to sovereignty.
---
Unfueled structures shouldn't get timers.
---
Resource availability should be redistributed. In general, it should be easier to find the resources to make T2 and capital Amarr ships in the Amarr quadrant of the map, along with the same for other empires (also, capital ships should require more than just minerals, moon goo prevalent in their respective area of space seems reasonable without requiring as much effort to gather as T2 stuff). In order to prevent another Technetium situation, this should not be absolute and you should still be able to find smaller amounts of it elsewhere. Beyond this, the availability of specific resources should vary more widely based on location (although as with resources primarily used for one empire's stuff, should not exclusively be found in any places).
---
Cyno should be available to a few more ships (T3D, combat recon, combat interceptor, for example). Still shouldn't be a ubiquitous way to open the umbrella whenever something rains on your krabbing. Corvettes shouldn't have cyno.
---
Did not know him, but o7 the cyno is lit.
---
Remove rorq mining.
---
I have a titan character I just set up training and left it for a year. I still can’t afford a titan but I could fly one if anyone has a spare.
---
zkill's killfeed is more useful. There are also discord bots which create feeds into discord channels with big kills. So, if you see several capitals die at once you can assume a proper fight going on. A single capital is usually a gank which the gankers loot and then shoot the wreck. I'm not sure if there is some public discord with such a feed setup. Try the talking in stations discord. I think this reddit here has a discord, too. And I think there is a discord focused on role playing. I think you might be into that one. I don't know the link though.
---
PA didn't buy the game eve online, they bought the IP, and the tech/source code. They could care less if the game itself dies. How long do you think it would take to get that investment back from reoccurring eve subs? 200 years?
---
This is kinda cool. Even for an event.
---
You were lucky and you liked BO. 
---
Would be more interesting to see you posting that you were not lucky but still liked BO.
---
Not ratters or DED site runners when I blow them up in my loki...
---
Make hunters install structures to monitor players in space, npcs killed, and other hunting data
---
Time for bomber nerf
---
A Kamikaze class would be amazing. A booster and module combination and you have a time limit to multiply alpha. The booster prevents ejection for 30 mins and you can't warp or cloak after the module is activated.
---
You have the "content" BE the reward (multiple layers of reward).  For "newbies" participating (x'ing up) the reward can be simple cash, or ships/gear/minerals, whereas for the "advanced players" who form fleets, points that allow buying of advanced gear (faction/officer), or coupons on volume purchasing of ships / gear for their members (i.e. the NPCs will subsidize some of the costs, sort of like SRP's).
---
If that is the case.. Then eve is in trouble.
---
wholesome content
---
Nobody gives a fuck you dumb piece of shit.
---
CCP apparently didn't agree with you either because they finally realized their mistake lmfao.
---
BTFO cunt
---
Quit being hysterical, your toy is back on monday.
---
ah right it's the risk averse crabs that are ruining the game. not like they are literally the ones getting hunted the most. with them gone the game would die even faster because the "wolves" like you would die out of hunger for content... but yeah, keep playing eve "as intended"...
---
&gt;I think you might be into that one. I don't know the link though.
---
I don't want to roleplay like that, but, I do want to salvage battlezones and look for undiscovered wrecks and stuff.
---
Joke will be when same carebears who cried about blackout will resume crying about bots and RMT next week or so.
---
THIS
---
AND THIS
---
It's not bravery to continually feed ships for no reason.
---
That's stupidity.
---
post fit I want gong ticks too
---
But total income generated by players also dropped. So the impact bots have on the economy wouldn’t necessarily go down. Meanwhile abyssal bots, mission bots, etc all had their dollars per hour go up during blackout
---
They removed local chat from nullsec. Things got out of hand. People left in droves and full on reddit war for the past 2 months. CCP wanted to keep it but I guess it just became untenable. Falcon on the left wanted it alot from his writings.
---
I don’t really find killing solo miners fun, tbh. Before blackout I’d get solo content by screwing around in Provi near 9UY/Y-M in a Hecate, trying to fight people and then run away when I got outnumbered. 
---
After blackout, I tried the same thing. And spent hours finding no content, until I ran into an assfrig gang from Test alliance and died to them (did manage to take one down with me). Hopefully adding local back will get people out in space again, but I’m skeptical that a lot of people have quit for good, and that there is nothing CCP can do to recover the lost players.
---
[removed]
---
Should just show killboard in local.
---
Null = bubble+hearth paladins confirmed.
---
but then how can I look the player up to see if they are snuggly before I undock!?!?!
---
Your screeching only works if you worth listening to. Try and you will see it.
---
Confirming Horde had a great drunk time.  Thanks for having us!
---
&gt;I found pvp content far easier to find, not just ganks but roam v roam content where neither side was the sov holder. And I am sad to see blackout go.
---
I had the opposite experience, content was HARDER to find because now that local intel went away, space felt and became more empty and less people wanted to undock.
---
I know for a fact I am not the only person who had this experience.
---
Is it that hard to form a few bombers and kill the ratting battleships? You don’t need that many, since you know what damage they’re weakest to.
---
Dont drink and fly.
---
Thank you for the invite and thank you for the brawl. This was fun. Loot bonanza was a good sport and I even got a 1bil isk transfer for final blow. Died 3 times (got bombed / lanced ), got saved by logi numerous times, my fingers were hurt after the brawl lol.
---
Look forward to the 10th birthday!
---
Fly mad 0/
---
I read the title as ‘can I have a fun time without playing’ and was prepared for an entirely different thread.
---
There may be an unmentioned "... and you're out if numbers don't come back up" clause in there, from the overlords.
---
Yes please. Fair should be fair. 
---
But revert the cyno change. Thank you!
---
Also, if you’re bombing run is successful your ship explodes, it’s only fair.
---
Literally what I said in the post above.
---
&gt; Whether you agree with the changes or not is your prerogative.
---
Reminds me of my armor rattle. Still sitting in a station, never killed.
---
https://youtu.be/KJlNbGRaqpU?t=76
---
What overview is that? How do I get all that extra information attached to each ship?
---
Those have been placeholders (on SISI I think) for a couple of years. A dev said it wasnt relevant to this not long ago here on reddit.
---
I always made sure corpies let signal cartel go. They helped some of our retarded members before
---
Stay neutral for sure.
---
Nice stuff Exo.
---
As an easy shakeup with WH's, I'd love to see CCP mess with Shattered WH's a bit. Right now I turn the fuck around and leave when I jump in one as I'm not scanning 20+ sigs. I've personally had one with 60 sigs, I've heard of someone getting an 80+ system.
---
Removing gas sites that clearly don't get farmed from these alone would cut 90% of the sigs out of them. If they want to go the extra step, add a couple more WH-&gt;WH statics to each. A shattered wormhole should be a moment of celebration, more possibilities, not feel like homework.
---
Try Asakai, I moved in there with 50frigs and got endless fights. Some great systems within a few jumps as well.
---
Ye cause we are all dying but not dead yet. Which means we should all kill ourselves today because we are going to die someday. Is it me or do you get better at this logic thing by the day?:)
---
So in the long run all blackout accomplished is shown once again that eve/CCP is a rudderless ship.
---
From now no need to make anything. If they make something that krabs dont like, they just wont log in again for 2 months, making CCP to kneel and CCP reverts it back. EVE is ruined by krabs.
---
Try Asakai, I moved in there with 50frigs and got endless fights. Some great systems within a few jumps as well. The locals and other regular solo pvpers will recognise you after long and know they can come to you for a fight.
---
Ah cool, cheers bud.
---
Do you want battlerorqs dropped on your head? Cause this is how you get battlerorqs dropped on your head.
---
The node does a “Local scan” every 30seconds to one minute. Then ok.
---
Democracy is in action!
---
How does Local effect your last two points (no blobbing by blocs and making a name for yourself)?
---
Doesnt work man. The umbrella is far from fullproof on a good day and it takes time to get ready. If you light the cyno too soon it will die. If you take too long the inhib will go up. If you cyno 200 off the response fleet will get bubbled and never reach the target.
---
FW is mostly dead compared to years past, but mostly dead isn't \*all\* dead. That said, it remains the place to go for the kind of content you're seeking whether you join a militia or not. Threads like this are a perfect example of why CCP needs to give FW some love, not just for the benefit of FW but for the benefit of lowsec PVP in particular and the health of the entire game in general.  
---
My buddy Raker made a particular point that bears emphasis: if you pick a militia you do stand out more to the opposing side as an engageable target. A lot of time when I'm roaming FW systems I don't bother to stop and check plexes unless I see a WT in local.  
---
One common tactic a lot of neutral pilots use is to start a FW plexing alt to help find fights. Can be kindof scummy, but doesn't have to be. Perhaps something for you to consider.
---
Simple change like this would be a great middle ground
---
&gt; Why are you all so obsessed with relentlessly kicking over sandcastles?
---
Because conflict is what allows groups to rise and build their own sand castles.  The problem is right now, the mechanics deincentivize and borderline punish any attempt to build a bigger sand castle.  The expense of the space and diminishing returns on value of taking more space combined with absolutely aids mechanics for taking and defending space (timezone tanking, entosis, citadel spam etc) makes it so no one actually wants to take more space, and in fact will run from it.
---
1. Jumping gives you a local timer - 3-5 minutes.
---
2. After that times runs out you appear in local
---
Effects:
---
- Crabs are in local by default since it takes &gt;5 minutes to finish a site
---
- Hunters don't appear in local unless they stick around in the same system
---
Not at all. Try Lachiesis if the Arazu's tank is not enough. A Jaguar with ADC can yolo into a small nano gang. And may I suggest logi?
---
&gt; In fairness, the previous meta was to wear out your opponent with SBU blueball ops until they gave up. Wars in Eve have always been prosecuted on the level of linemember morale, or titan blob. "Blueballs or helldunks" isn't anything new, and neither is the Great Grind War.
---
And this is what CCP should be addressing.
---
TEST alliance
---
At least ratting that drops end game loot or ISK.
---
I left the game 8 months because it was getting really stagnant, I couldn't find game content, wasn't enjoying the game. I only have so much limited time per day/week for eve online. I came back to play when blackout was introduced, it was fun while it lasted. Its just too time consuming to find game content. I can't afford logging in to join CTA, taking hours to do forming up, waiting for timers and firing a shot in 5 mins per cycle during tidi. It is just not enjoyable anymore, it's not the eve online I played and had so much fun when I started in 2011.
---
That was fun, thanks for arranging the event and thanks for our FC who took us there! (:
---
If you think that the right response to someone trying to kill your space ship is to run away, you've trained yourself in the Pavlovian sense to be a prey item.
---
It is not about cost of the structure but about the timers it can generate and mechanics it implements.         
---
Low cost is also to incentivize people "ah fuck it no worth to defend it" but then "oh shit they replaced with their own now i need to kill this thing"
---
Good comment meeiqs
---
Personal random thoughts about wh space:
---
\- low tier gases could spawn less so there is less worthless signals to sift through
---
\- high tier wormholes C5/6 should have null grade moongoo. 
---
\- sealing whs for farming in safety is cancer , static exit should spawn immediately whether you warp to it or not. 
---
\- C6s should be dual static as a continuation of c2 and c4 trend
---
Even PvPers don't want to PvP when they're making money, because they're making money and losing their ship or even just having to respond to it eats into efficiency.
---
At the heart of this is the same problem that has always existed: the most profitable (in both time and mental acuity) PvE activities are the ones that you can automate or be AFK for, and PvE ships are utterly useless for PvP on a directly opposing scale. The more blinged the ship the better.
---
Basically, Eve is on a death spiral when it comes to this dichotomy and has been for some time. Trying to do something as major as this was always going to have predictable consequences, and now that we know what the threshold is for any such change to be aborted we also know that the status quo will never change  dramatically again.
---
It's all about the Isk and Signal Cartel is about to be very wealthy.
---
Just wait till he attacks you then you will know.
---
That was not CONCORD but the Caldari faction police.
---
so you just want the disadvantage of the opponent, not really ... not risk averse.
---
It's still possible to nanodrake pretty well. The trick is you gotta put a skirmish link on it. If you're concerned about HML application go with a navy drake and you're even faster and have better application. The original nanodrakes died before they added MJD but now, nanodrake with skirmish link and MJD with application rigs and you've got what I consider the best skirmish combat battlecruiser in the game. 
---
Tl,dr: if you do it right, you CAN bring a drake.
---
Make smaller less permanent “nomadic base” structures.
---
Basically an anchorable Orca, with size restrictions. This I think would make lower class WH like ccp originally intended all WH space. Not for permanent living.
---
Also Dark Matter has degenerative effects on structures.
---
I know I know!
---
I thought a show was linked with alliance leaders the other day where they were all saying it was bad ? Didn’t listen to much but maybe I misunderstood
---
So that's why CCP is building that new office building at the moment, to shut it down soon.
---
Like it!
---
Way too big when compared to supers
---
The bots had already adjusted and were returning in droves. The removal of local was never more than a temporary inconvenience for them.
---
This reflexive insistence on shouting "BUT DE BOTS!" every time blackout comes up isn't doing your side of this argument any favors. Everybody knows it's crap.
---
Umbrellas without hard cynos?
---
What you say about pve is a consequence of the competitive nature of the economy : the economy is completely free, so what determines the efficiency of your pve activity is not the amount of isk you get each hour, but it's amount *compared to the other players*.
---
This state pushes players to an hyperspecialization mindset. You can't pve in a ship that can pvp, because you would lose on your pve efficiency, and then your in-game wages would be lower. And you can't have pve be like pvp because an AI will always be exploited, at least for the forseeable future.
---
At least on the pvp aspect something can be done: remove information so people will slowly get the idea that for an engagement to happen in a game like eve there needs to be an uncertain outcome.
---
Thank you for the invitation! We had an absolute blast and happy birthday. I put some clips of the brawl together, hope y'all enjoy it.
---
[https://youtu.be/51unu1RUl28](https://youtu.be/51unu1RUl28)
---
the bots just whined and quited, ccp saw their lovely money go away and rolled the change back. gg money wins over fun again
---
justice? botters will become more active again and inflation will go on with around 30% each year. good luck paying 5bill in 2 years for your plex
---
bots never left, if you think they did then you need a crash course in common sense
---
Civilians in military warzones?
---
Why are they even allowed to enter?
---
That's good to know, though the game is an entirely different beast since I quit around when MJD's came out.  Every so often I get tempted but it's better off just living in my nostalgia with rose-tinted glasses instead of coming back to all the bullshit that comes along with the fun.
---
it would just be for the side with the structure up yeah, which would be dumb and unbalanced in defender favour
---
Thanks for sharing your lesson.
---
Btw, how much tank would be needed to withstand 20 Thrashers long enough for Concord to obliterate them?
---
Would, say, a 300k buffer do?
---
Any battleship burst tank would crumble due to the alpha of the Thrashers, right? Even a pimped Golem, all tank (ie just scram, prop and grapple, the rest of the mids dedicated to the pimped burst tank), say, 10000 EHP/s overheated?
---
fuck off, no one wants extra structure spam, or weighted intel. Full local is good for both, only people who complain about local are low skill nerds who can't outsmart spodbrains
---
Yea that would be laughable.
---
lmao, im almost down for this out of spite in regards to all the dudes trying to make life difficult for only the pve side
---
Glad somebody else has thought of that. No info on the player except the standings until they speak. No longer can you keep track of the movements of individual pilots and no longer can you look up killboards for perfect Intel.
---
Who’s the not-Falcon man?
---
Honestly this helps the hunted as well. Hunters can't easily determine the bears for other hunters so might exactly run into a fair fight. I like this idea, less intel for all.
---
I guess redditting and drinking in prep of SM3LL birthday party is not compatible :(
---
I feel like Faxes should be a little smaller and Dreads a little bigger.
---
Eyes forward, capsuleer, the cyno is not yet lit. Consider your modules, your rigs and ammo before you undock, for the cyno is not yet lit. Break free of the station and witness the universe before you, For the cyno is not yet lit. Set your ship to fly through the vastness while you wait, For the cyno is not yet lit. Pay attention, capsuleer, for those who have gone before you call for you to join them. The cyno is now lit.
---
An injected char with no reputation would get rejected from any alliance that doesn't have policies to mass recruit newbies, they're very obvious.
---
That's not to say that it's hard to get a spy into other groups, but that an injected spy is not the way to go.
---
&gt; Which means we should all kill ourselves
---
You shouldn't promote suicide.
---
So most of this sub then?
---
Tbh it was fucking stupid when there was no local, but you could check how many people were out mining or ratting in a system. That's absolutely broken and was the definition of weighted intel.
---
But that argument goes nowhere. Unless all of those people who felt alienated before come back, mass alienation of your current players is still the way towards the edge of a cliff. As OP mentioned a reasonable timescale with explanation would have probably lead to less whining.
---
This would be so fucking good!
---
In game mechanic terms I think you’re talking about “stabilizing” a wormhole.  I would think it should be an interesting mechanic to have if you can 1) deploy a wormhole stabilizer that extends the duration or fixes the wormhole to the system (i.e. If no ships enter or exit it would be there indefinitely, but ships can decay the wormhole entrance), 2) deploy a wormhole gate that can move ships through a wormhole without decaying it that have 4 tiers (frigs, cruiser,etc) that you can set with a password, or allow certain players/corps/alliances/everyone. You’d need a stabilizer on both ends, but a worm-gate on the end you want to move through.
---
Given that opponents could still 1) pop the stabilizer, 2) pop the worm-gate, 3) decay the hole the old way (if you get past any defences), this would be an interesting mechanic for people to create their own paths through space from normal space to wormhole to wormhole to normal space.
---
As a sidenote, one of the things I see being a problem with the game is how much of a bottleneck the current gate system is.  Would be nice if people could set a path that doesn’t constantly need a fleet.
---
Yea we could have new pirate BCs instead. Though I do love the Trig ships (who doesn’t?).
---
Still gotta fix being able to see how many people are ratting and mining in a system then. Cause that doesn't benefit anyone but those looking for easy kills
---
The bots whined? What?
---
I'd rather Eve die standing than live on it's knees
---
30 seconds when you already have checked how many people are mining/ratting in a system is a long time.
---
You already have a massive intel advantage at that point.
---
Does it matter who unsubs? People who make this argument seem to miss the point that each of those players pays to keep this game alive. Yeah, you could argue that Eve could live of 5k players but good luck with that. I'm pretty sure CCP and PA would pull the plug way before that.
---
Did you win by AFK ratting and going back to highsec like pussies when blackout was in effect?
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
Says the goon
---
You say that but I remember like a year ago one or two goon fcs somehow managed to get bombed like five or six times in the span of a month in unbubbled jackdaws. Absolutely inspiring.
---
exactly man, like I do pvp i don't pve at all but its fucking ridiculous to push for changes  that only benefit me as if that's the only healthy thing for the game. there was plenty of ways to make things  happen pre blackout, small gangers are just low skill crybabies who need CCP to hold their hand into kills.
---
i let autopilot it someone so in worstcase i wont be on killboard
---
Go easy on him, he eats crayons
---
make npc hics evrywhere
---
now do this to carriers,titans
---
Dramatically increasing rewards vs local removal should be fine to encourage people krabbing with the risk, but you have to somehow prevent them from doing it 24/7, or at least encourage to not do it too much.
---
Wormholes are good on this level because you get retardedly good anomaly rewards but you don't have that many.
---
I see your flair is still wormholer. Are you transitioning to becoming more than a GSF line member? I'm cheering for you!
---
For real, this. That playstyle is already a thing. Folks that want no local have freedom to go to j space and do their thing there instead of trying to ruin everyone elses game
---
The big challenge of wh space is you have to scan every gate and the gates change all the time, which means searching active content out in wh space is a fairly significant chore
---
Linemember lol
---
Not gonna happen. Already said too many times, you delete assets people took years to make, you kill your game, end of story.
---
Why can't people understand this, I mean, it's not rocket science.
---
Heh... Reading all of that and then the last words are "when you are -9 sec status" you should have just typed "to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air".
---
I think the people who run bots whined because they need local chat to bot properly.
---
As long as the Umbrellas exist there is basically no way for CCP to end stagnation without killing their game (see blackout as it was implemented). Somehow umbrellas need to be removed from the game without angering the players so much that they leave forever. 
---
The second big thing that EvE needs is the broad introduction of "diminishing returns"-systems across PvE and PvP. There has to be a point where it is no longer efficient to "bring n+1" to win/get more isk. The FAX changes were the first step and they seem to work. That needs to be applied to DPS as well, so that its not efficient to shoot 1 target with 200 ppl  (Subcap logi need to be changed to the FAX system too to make it work). PvE also needs to be changed, one option would be to increase spawn timers of pve-sites in 0.0 after a certain amount are done per day and system, so ppl farming all day have to spread out more or move around to maintain good ticks.
---
cyno cant be lit due to patch
---
CCP always listens to the same demographic. But that's an aging demographic that's naturally declining over time. So they can keep their favourites happy, but that'll never give them the subscription stats they want - it certainly hasn't been great for business during the last 16 years. Or they can abandon their favourites, weather out the storm as those guys unsub, and then evolve the game to attract new blood. Seems like they went for option one.
---
At current rates, between 80 and 100 hours for a 10b rorqual.
---
Pog Champ, 5Head, the pepe is not yet pepeJam.
---
Consider your emotes, your subs and copypastas before you unpog, for the pepe is not yet pepeJam.
---
Break free of the monkaTOS and monkaS the streamer before you, For the pepe is not yet pepeJam.
---
Set your chat to sub mode and Pog the pogness while you HYPERCLAP, For the pepe is not yet pepeJam.
---
KKool, 5Head, for those Poggers have pepeJam before you ppHop for you to 3Head them.
---
The pepe is now pepeJam.
---
have 153  cyno ships leftover,now useless
---
Well I had no idea about this. How exactly does this work? I always get a timer.
---
Your fault for not using them in time.
---
The Drake is an excellent ship. It’s got great tank/gank potential and can be fitted as a decent kiting ship. The navy drake is even better and a legit powerhouse. 
---
The years of “can I bring my Drake” memes have undermined the potential of the Drake.
---
Lol, you've seen the Incursion multiboxers, right?
---
Get off your high horse.
---
When CCP just announced their deal with Koreans, i predicted that in a year or two EVE’s focus will start switching more and more towards pve and constant grind.
---
It actually sad to see my predictions slowly becoming true
---
Heard it all before. 
---
https://twitter.com/evenews24/status/985150267992739841
---
We need a new EVE. This one is too old flawed and infested.
---
You mean, jumping out of a WH, look for a mining/ratting anom, warp in cloaked and gank is difficult?

Yep it would be on the dev team to implement something like this. Supposedly 'Chaos' as it's being dubbed is coming to J-space as well, so I figured maybe throw some input out there for something that could be thought over. Wait and see what's next I guess; at the end of the day they're not gonna please everybody and should definitely listen to player base input to keep the game running.
---
Who wouldn't want big payouts and efficiency. You comparing someone farming a max level contested area in wow to someone doing a full South Park in a level 1 zone. Sure, there no risk, but you become mad in the process.
---
The reason people want big payouts is to do their farming faster so it requires less time PvEing, which is boring. The only not-boring pve is rorqual mining because you can afk socializing/netflix in the process, go figures.
---
People should stop trying to force pvp on people when they go to these lengths to avoid it. Or at least face the consequence of trying to do so, which means getting the hammer. CCP should prevent 24/7 farming so people have to do something else (like pvp, lol), while increasing results to compensate.
---
eve need full drop from citadels like pos, that is will drive nullsec alliance to fight and less reinforce time.
---
To be fair, most of them were saying 'I'm fine with smallgang, just not on my turf : you get the hammer for that shit".
---
Which is... fine ? I mean, you shit on someone's home, why shouldn't he retaliate the way he wishes to ?
---
You really have a gripe against small gang / solo players. Can you link your killboard so I can get a better understanding of the PvP you do?
---
Lost me at the 
---
&gt;But what seems to really not get mentioned enough: Sandcastles, and kicking them over.
---
Cause this Shows you have no idea of whats going on out there in null.
---
Current mechanics dont even incentivise to move your Holdings often.
---
It starts with what is needed to make sure you hold it up to the entire point of whats needed to fully utilize it
---
&gt;Wars and big battles aren't just good for eve for the headlines they generate, they're good because fighting means isk sinks, BIG ones.
---
Next wrong!
---
Wars mean ISK shuffle no sink. CCP doesnt get a serious share out of a buildt Battleship or Titan thats just ISK moving from one Player to another.
---
&gt;There is almost 0 incentive to expand, to go out and fight other groups for space
---
Right because why would i go and kick anyone out of their sov for shit i already have and put up with the pain it is to wait out the 1+ months to use my New gainings?
---
You think they'd throw away a 450m investment?
---
It isn't. Even with your 25038 chat channel open, the space feel empty. Because your channels don't show where people are, just that they are logged.
---
How many times did we have conversation with people in local, shittalking, etc... ? You can still do it, but you take the risk to talking only to yourself.
---
Changes should be incremental and not massive hammer swings in either direction.
---
They damage the economy a lot less in HS
---
And cynos not fitting on ships that have a jumpdrive is perfectly ok. Restricting them to two ships that are either very expensive or ridiculously expensive is retarded.
---
Reminder that some people *liked* Blackout and dearly want to see capital mobility reduced
---
Is it better to make bots and afk farms quit, or keep them around and continue down the road to eventual destruction?
---
WH Incursion when?
---
&gt; You comparing someone farming a max level contested area in wow to someone doing a full South Park in a level 1 zone.
---
Not really.
---
Two expectations here are the problem:
---
 * that "big ships and big money" == "end game".
---
 * that you can and should be able to reach it by design and basically on your own
---
The "I *deserve* to fly a badass ship"-attitude. Maybe you don't. Deal with that. HTFU.
---
&gt;The reason people want big payouts is to do their farming faster so it requires less time PvEing, which is boring. 
---
As I said, I can get ***my*** "farming" done in like 10 minutes. If you can't, your expectation of the outcome is the problem. It's not that reaching a viable goal isn't possible, it's that you expect a certain goal to be reachable with minimum effort.
---
It's literally wanting hand-outs.
---
&gt;People should stop trying to force pvp on people when they go to these lengths to avoid it.
---
No. Eve is a pvp game at it's core. The entire game is based around stuff being destroyed and rebuilt. It based around risk management. If there is no risk, there is no game. You can still mine or pve, but if there is nothing else happening, all you're doing is increasing some number on some server. Maybe you unlock some new thing you can spin your camera around.
---
(and by the way, you can have that with less effort : https://eve-nt.uk/designer/  )
---
Take away the destruction, you don't have a game, you have "watching an inflation in 3d, with a black background".
---
If you don't like that, in your own interest, you should play a different game. Play on the test server. Seriously. I don't get why you're playing this game, but if you don't like the pvp rules, this game is not a good fit for you.
---
Hold my hand Lorenzo lol
---
rreeee much?
---
Haha, thanks man. 😁
---
Glad that you're enjoying it, means I'm doing something right \o/
---
On pc I got dark screen on warp. Re-logged. All sweet
---
cocaine in my brain
---
die toten hosen :3
---
They were actually intended to be much smaller, you can tell this when you look at the windows on the ship and how blurry and pixelated they are
---
&gt;So you think they should do?
---
Limit the max amount of isk you get from ratting. Now isk increases almost linearly when you go from cruiser to battleship to carrier to super. It shouldn't be like that. Isk income should taper of when you go with capitals.  
---
Thats one idea. If CCP want more instructions on how to manage the game they can pay me
---
This is probably the easiest solution in terms of Dev time lol
---
LOL not bad not bad
---
That's true, just look at the amount of isk being printed. It's only dropped by %70

---
I'm sure most of that 75 TRILLION ISK was players actively ratting in supers :D That seems like a reasonable amount for active players to rat in a single month without botting.
---
relog?
---
Correct. He miscalculated space \[on the floating board\] and ended at the bottom of sea.
---
Stop being that obviously biased. He's right when he's saying that it is not perfect intel : cloaky campers would have been way less effective if so. Observatories would make sense, because an Empire having space and no long range sensors to control it would be probably dead in a minute.
---
Is local overpowered against small gang roamers ? Probably so. But here's a thought : Every one of these small ganger posters on Reddit make the point that big alliances kill the game with their umbrellas and that local is too powerful, but well, why should you have it better with your 10 people when you get into someone's territory they spent weeks/months/years to setup ?
---
When I go to Delve to hunt krabs, I'm not expecting my small party to be engaged by a group of the same size and strength. I'm expecting to be helldunked to oblivion, and that's fine, it makes it more of an achievement to kill anything there. I'm not waiting for free krabs kills like a lot of people seem to expect with their "You're undocking in null you consent to die" bullshit.
---
Wanna know why the small gang playstyle is dying ? Lot of reasons, first being the small gang mentality of roaming to kill dirty krabs (which is fine), pushing players into groups becoming bigger and bigger to protect themselves, second is the death of lowsec, prime region for small gang activity, which is 100% CCP's fault, and lastly because this game is fucking 17 years old and they cannot expect people to still be in nano frigs/cruisers and not drop their inexisting hammer on them
---
Everyone could have foreseen this. CCP should have foreseen this. It didn't happen.
---
This unfortunately.. beyond citidels and this new invasion, oh and drifters.. what is really new that isn't rehashed content. Or updated ui style stuff * see crime watch*
---
With all those bad decisions in CCP recently, makes you wonder what pushed CCP Guard to actually leave.
---
Tried that, twice. 
---
  Ticket submitted, DT will probably fix it. Fun bug though!
---
it will fix after DT
---
Everyone says that until its time to actually die.
---
No, please do :)
---
&gt;might
---
  So in other words- A random stab in the dark.
---
  Predictions in this sub are always terrible.
---
When i’m solo its usually when its a weak time zone, when i’m working from home theres 1-2 people online most of the time. In our prime hours we could realistically form for it but its too much to take solo.            
---
           
---
Even 3 bling lokis is going to struggle against 4 bs’s sufficiently that you wouldn’t take the fight as the sole human.
---
Good riddance
---
I mean, doesnt the meme go "Eve is dying"? None of us know when it will expire. But we sure as shit know it wouldnt be long if you had your wish. Thankfully CCP has some business sense left.
---
You say the sweetest things Grath:)
---
Cause alpha bots give CCP money?
---
stop flair baiting idiot
---
if you made it one per system  that would solve the spam problem
---
also if you make it no timer, then it enhances tactical gameplay. IT makes a nice target for small gangs to go after since they dont need to come back later to finish it, and it cant run so the residents would need to defend it
---
furthermore it add a level of strategy for both offense and defense. If these start going down, you dont really know if its a small gang or a forward scout detachment clearing the way for a larger fleet, and from the offensive side , you can send off squads to take down local in random other systems as a decoy
---
ITT: anyone who has an opinion different from mine is a bot.
---
I liked the blackout, but I liked Falcon having to swallow his delusion of being the lead dev that uses Reddit for changes to the game better. They don't have structures ready, they don't have code for a blackout-light. They just flipped a switch because Falcon convinced Hilmar a few vocal multiboxing wormholers on Reddit were right. 
---
When you burn your bum, you gotta sit on the blisters.
---
that's heartbreaking o7
---
True r/eve form: When I can't do it myself, whinge and hope ccp does it for me.
---
PVE has only got safer and safer over the years but one change that favours PVP and you get all upset and unsub. aww poor you
---
You didnt. First weeks they were for it but then it became clear that it wasnt all that great and they changed their minds. The guy that disliked it on the clip I think you are thinking of was Inominate, one of the Imperium CSM members after the week with CCP. I think they heard some things there that quite shook them. Even Olmeca got a bit worried. I guess we will see what it was in time.
---
That will lead to goons destroying even more small alliances to get their space.
---
I mean maybe you shouldn't be a solo player in nullsec. I get you used spies, but people should've been ratting in a standing fleet with a channel for that system and being on comms.
---
But you still see the standing, so you dock up when a neut is reported 10j away.
---
Origin is so hot right now.
---
Your clicking is so slow on your modules I am fairly sure Muhammad Ali could beat you in a reaction speed contest.
---
Are you saying he's wrong?
---
Why live in NS outside of big blocks if you can make more money running incursions and just go to NS when you want pvp?
---
The sad truth is that it was a good idea poorly implemented by CCP and squandered on excavator and sub cap krab kills by the players who held it as the return of the golden age of PVP.
---
what is so overpowered on the trig ships(apart from the kikimora)?
---
Lmao are you comparing loot boxes to skill injectors? I haven't seen many newbros get a fuck ton of injectors and jump into any ship, especially blinged. I have however seen rorq alts that have been around for about 3 days. Injecting to the max.
---
I'll give you a titan of you give me your character after it finishes training.
---
Yes but the question is will the game servive the Storm
---
Just blame the legacy code
---
&gt; they need local chat to bot properly.
---
They really don't
---
See this right here is exactly right! CCP are pandering to people that have played the game for 16 years and are slowly leaving anyway due to RL, nothing wrong with that btw, however CCP need to make and KEEP these changes to improve the game, numbers may drop hard but once the "old guard" have gone CCP need to push to get new blood in with good marketing and continued changes.
---
Why do people keep using 1 point of data, PLEX, as a basis for inflation? CCPs own numbers are saying we dont have any substantial inflation.
---
Another idea, nerf cap repairs in c1-c4 holes. When I lived in wormholes I felt the drop in brawls as soon as FAX arrived. Most cases you could not take a fight in the other guys hole any more because after a minute or so an Apostle or Ninazu showed up and basically made the other fleet go invulnerable.
---
Which really should have been the move to begin with and stopped there.
---
The blackout was never here to stay. From the get go CCP stated it was temporary so they could measure demographics.
---
But I guess the truth doesn't fit the narrative right...
---
Null had local forever, but not every system had a station. You had pipes to go hunting in , it didnt matter if you saw enemies in local, you either fought, ran or bounced untill logoff.  I think the structure spam in null made it to safe, i carrier rat and even i think they need reworking.
---
Any idea on how to change the structure spam? My initial idea would be to have a cap on how many structures an alliance can have, but this might just result in them splitting up their corps/alliance. Maybe a cap depending on player numbers? But that could also be countered by just making alphas on mass
---
PLEX is about the only free floating item that gives an indication of the real value of ISK. Everything else is based on mineral supply - and we all know that nullblobs have also spammed the mineral markets.
---
Those are Triglavian
---
I wouldn't argue it's made by gamers.. more like a group of people whom discovered Pandora's box and can't figure out how to use it lol. Part of it we can chop up to them being small but ChAoS era has CCPs usual shit written allover it.
---
Yeah here
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cwkrbw/z/eycrc9s
---
I'm sure it's not perfect but it seems like a better foundation going forward.
---
No reason for a wormholer to have a -9 sec status, you should probably fix that.
---
I once logged my vindi out in a safe in an incursion system. It didn't end well because exactly where my safe was. One of the most terrifying sites known to man appeared. I escaped with basically no hp on my ship. Be careful boys. Or else a fucking site will spawn on your ass.
---
So CCP gave in to Null sec tears so much for them having balls and for them to creat chaos.
---
Thatd be really fuckin cool i think
---
CCP actually proposed this in a dev blog in 2004.
---
That sounds like a good idea
---
The centiment I agree with but they shouldn't have gotten more rewards there should have been a week or two of blackout then upwells observatories launching to fix this now askewed risk ratio. 
---
Because full local is to strong but no local isn't strong enough.
---
Sucks to suck.
---
If your farming is to get 34 fitted merlins to afk in FW or chase random noobs, sure. We're not all playing to do frigate pvp, which you may or may not have understood yet.  There are very few activities in Eve that allow big payouts in such a short time, and none that can be done by all the playerbase without the efficiency plummeting.
---
You are advocating something which is the reason Eve cannot keep players in : "Go slow, you're not entitled to have big things, farm L1 mission for weeks first". Thing is, we're not in 2003 anymore, MMO are now way faster-paced and you cannot expect to keep new players if they have to wait 10 years to be relevant. That's why Karmafleet, PH, Brave and others are so successful : you can be relevant in a T1 frig and still be able to advance quickly to catch up and do other things.
---
I did the slow start like everyone else, doing L3/L4 in drake for horrendous payouts in a boring hell, because it was the only way, but I wish I could/choose to join one of these at the time, it would have been funnier and more effective.
---
People don't want to take away destruction, but they will go out of their way to prevent you from destroying their ships, be it that you can never again be able to. Is there no risk in the current iteration of nullsec ? No, but there not much in umbrella space as long as the players coming in are 10 men gangs in nano ships. Tell people there is no risk when they get burned by Spectre fleet/Bomber bar/INIT stukas every 5 minutes. Why are these groups successful ? Because they take the time, effort and people to be able to do so.
---
You're not entitled to destruction, you want destruction at low effort. Big alliance shouldn't have to deploy 200 people 24/7 camping gates and systems plus standing fleets just because there could be one small gang roaming somewhere. Instead, they just setup an umbrella, have a FC on standby and ask people to be responsible and come help their friends if need arises.
---
Eve is a PvP game, like you say, and people will choose how they will answer your pvp endeavor, be it with a hammer or a response fleet. You have no right to choose for them, and shouldn't feel entitled to being able to.
---
We used to completely farm small gangs so hard so they wouldn't come back anymore back in the day, does it change anything from today's situation ? No, but you have targets for your anger and I dare say jealousy.
---
&gt; No. Eve is a pvp game at it's core. The entire game is based around stuff being destroyed and rebuilt. It based around risk management. If there is no risk, there is no game. You can still mine or pve, but if there is nothing else happening, all you're doing is increasing some number on some server. Maybe you unlock some new thing you can spin your camera around. 
---
Do you truly believe there are that many people in this game that just want ships to spin around and are playing game only for that ? I'm sure there are like 2 people and a half like that, the rest is playing the game for what it's for, even if for them Pvp in once a year when goons are deployed.
---
You don't understand risk management at all : blackout demonstrated people are not keen on having risk not offsetted by rewards. Almost every fucking nullsec player agrees that there can be more risk as long as rewards follow, because undocking a ship that take 4 hours to even break even with the massive influx of random gankers having a hard-on due to blackout is totally retarded.
---
 
---
&gt;Two expectations here are the problem:  
---
&gt;that "big ships and big money" == "end game".  
---
&gt;that you can and should be able to reach it by design and basically on your own  
---
&gt;The "I *deserve* to fly a badass ship"-attitude. Maybe you don't. Deal with that. HTFU.
---
 No, these are YOUR problem. YOU think these expectations are the problem because the way YOU feel the game should work. Protip : it no longer work like that and even never worked like that.
---
People don't deserve to fly any ship by default. They deserve it because they take the time and put in effort to be able to do so, something you clearly have a hard time understanding, because for you this effort and time is wasted because you cannot kill these people easily.
---
If you have a problem with the majority of the playerbase not having the same goals and expectations as you, deal with that and HTFU.
---
&gt; If you don't like that, in your own interest, you should play a different game. Play on the test server. Seriously. I don't get why you're playing this game, but if you don't like the pvp rules, this game is not a good fit for you. 
---
If you have issue with how the game is played by a majority that does not care about your views and expectations, maybe you should try Hello Kitty Adventures. I don't get why you play a game when you don't like the Pve and Pvp rules that are in place. You have the right to complain and try to make things change, you don't have the right to shit on others just because you're an entitled dumbass that think everyone is playing for HIS enjoyment alone.
---
That rorq save was pretty rough. We should have easily saved at least 3 of the 4 that died.
---
People have been trying to help CCP for ages. CCP just got stuck with the thought that sandbox game meant bigger is better, so the size of corps and alliances got bigger, we went from essentially two structures (pos and station) that could only be anchored on moon or planet.. to today’s nonsense of multiple structures that can be anchored in any number anywhere. And people have been telling CCP that ganking mechanisms was hurting players retention for years. Even real sandbox has better framed rules than the current and last few iteration of EVE. 
---
What was it that brought players in during 2008-9 and has been making them leave since 2013-4, and specially during the last year ?
---
3-5 min timer is the same as blackout, even worse since it would be misinformative and bias intel to the hunter.
---
These are legit good ideas. The carebears don’t even realize that the 2nd suggestion actually helps them save isk.
---
I can't think of a wormhole group desperate enough to accept someone who is deliberately hamstringing themselves to this extent, tbh.
---
Actually the economic report showed extreme decreases in bots
---
It don't work this way.        
---
You need to have cyno ships preffited and ready to go at multiple location.
---
So then you just deserve to die?
---
Woah that's wild
---
For reference, a C1 site is a tiny bit better than a L4 Mission. Most lower W Space corps are single time zone so it's VERY easy to miss someone being online. As far as I've seen over the past couple of years, lower W Space is as populated as it's ever been, though the corps are a lot smaller in size. Cloaked ships don't kill anyone and a huge array of ships can warp off inside the decloak+ lock time of a cloaky. MJD's are already too powerful, they don't need to now be immune to scrams. Isk isn't a balancing tool
---
As for ISK.
---
Right now non-blue loot isn't worth the time of day as T3's are garbage. No one as far as I've heard is running a mainline T3 doctrine including W Space as there's a ton of ships more worthwhile in that size/mass range. Making T3's viable day to day somewhere would be a great start. I'd love if T3C's had an extra bonus that was only active in W Space so they could compete with the other doctrines. Cap recharge, cap resistance, gun cap usage, pure HP, there's a ton of options.
---
If W Space isn't willing to make T3C's the default choice, why even have them.
---
On from that, a T3 Orca would be amazing. It's already got a ton of roles they can be used for so T3ing it and giving it like 2 subs would be amazing. 
---
Finally, Blops ships need a relook, so go all in on that and make Blops T3's. Give them subs and T3D stances, make them ultimate button clicking machines that a good pilot can truly make shine.
---
W Space has the isk potential already there, its just not worthwhile as the ships it's used in aren't built.
---
Elo sounds like an actual frothing retard
---
New invasion contents payout is primarily from salvages. So you can go invasion systems, be a jerk and ninja salvage peoples wreck or make it in to a business to offer your services for a modest fee. 
---
But I would reccomend going to whs or big null fights simply because it would be more interesting for you.
---
Wow classic. Hard core. Choose one.
---
Maybe remove local and remove covop cloaks
---
The premise of this post seems a bit off. C2 space is actually the most popular right now. A lot, if not most, active/relevant wormhole groups live in a C2. The dual statics are just so convenient.
---
The "problem" that you mentioned, that just holes are inhabited by 5-member alt corps that only log in to farm is way more prevalent in C5/C6 space. Almost every hole there is a dedicated farm hole for someone. Probably because they are actually worth farming.
---
That is such a good idea
---
CCP just wants you to be double omega
---
&gt;Yet another Blackout post
---
All I needed to know.
---
Also remove covop cloaks
---
What ships? You wanna sell?
---
Make it so that the higher the concentration of structures in an area, they stress the space near one another, and weaken their defenses. Not sure if this is best done at the grid, system, or constellation level.
---
Remove covop cloaks
---
PVE has only got safer in null due to the players, if we don't police our space it would be as  dangerous as 2003.  sure more people have quicker reacting  ships but if we don't react ships still die can't blame people for not wanting to die.
---
did ther black out giv pvp a small advantage no it gave them a massive advantage, i'm hoping ccp bring back the blackout but a more balanced version.
---
so basicaly you think your playstyle&gt;his play style
---
im pretty sure the real math is who buys game time off CCP and im not sure that aligns with your point of view
---
we all have our own niche in eve and deciding that only one is valid will kill the game and thats what CCP almost just did
---
Deeply controversial opinion here, but I think the binary nature of scrams is a primary cause of issues.
---
If you're scrammed, you're fighting forever. So you either are tanking until help arrives, with super umbrella being a fast way to achieve this, Or you're out fighting them, at which point they just disengage.
---
Putting scrams on a time limit would allow for making it easier for small groups to ambush. Knowing that they would need to break tanks, and allow for solo stalemates to not always just escalate until some blob appears.
---
Yeah, but capital ships can't lock and delete dedicated anti-capital subcaps so clearly the game is broken beyond repair.
---
&gt;If you have issue with how the game is played by a majority that does not care about your views and expectations, maybe you should try Hello Kitty Adventures.
---
...but *you* want the safe space?
---
They all have the same features to a greater or lesser extent. Kiki is the most ridiculous but leshak, arguably vedmak, nergal and ikitursa are all very strong.
---
- Triglavian weapons have DPS equivalent to a full rack of normal guns, but they only use one slot. This means that triglavian ships have utility highs.
---
- They have very high DPS in a brawl or tackle situation where they can spin up on one target - up to double the DPS of other equivalent weapon systems. This makes them particularly OP in 1v1s and small gangs.
---
- They don't have to trade off between DPS, range and tracking. Like lasers, they get to switch range instantly, but even short range ammo is not that short. A large ED has a tracking of 5.45; large railguns and beams are around 1-1.5. Large blasters have a tracking of 5.5, but a tiny range. You see the same pattern at all sizes - triglavian guns get the range benefit equivalent to long range weapons, but track like short range ones.
---
To your post and post above. Fully fitted Hel isn't 7bil it's about 25. 
---
And yes, they are a lot to loose for a single person who is not super rich. 
---
You need to work for months (assuming you also have some Real world life) to get one.
---
And once you have one, it takes about 90 hours of perfect uninterrupted ratting to pay one off.
---
90h if you have 100mil ticks, which means you are flying undertanked setup, and you are not smart.
---
25 bil is a LOT to loose, in the end it's just not worth te risk, the stress and everything involved.
---
Otherwise I agree with your post completely, and pve revamp is necessary.
---
I was actually looking for your daily post earlier. I hope you continue to do them. Cause whenever I say something stupid (which happens more often than I would like) I can just read what youve written and think "hey, atleast heres someone worse than me". 
---
So thank you bro!
---
Massive advantage, you mean like showing everyone in system so you can quickly dock up? You mean programs like near2 that watch intel for you so you can still when enemies are 10 jumps out. PVE players have had it incredibly good for YEARS. I don't think removing local completely was the answer but nor is having it up 24/7.
---
Yea this happened to me and DT did the trick.
---
Yes, however neutrals will appear in a constellation much more often than in your system, so if you wimp out and dock up every time a neut hits that chat, you'll be wasting a lot of ratting time. For the same reason, local doesn't have the same impact in lowsec.
---
can’t updoot this more
---
Ratters stay in system for more than 3 minutes so it wouldn't misinform the hunter.
---
If you think its gonna work that way then well..
---
 Tranquility will soon become the new Serenity. CCP pussied out because of all the whining, bitching, unsubbing and not-logging of all the full-time krabs, spodbrains and bots and now there is no way to comeback from this mess. They just wasted their last chance.
---
wow you really are salty AF.  eve is 16 years old, i've personally played for 14 of those years 
---
Rorquals are OP imo but to blame them for the end of small gang pvp in null is BS
---
Having every single upwell structure self destruct along with every asset in their hangers, no asset safety?
---
No insurance payout either
---
Wish I could upvote this 1,000 more times
---
few cyno carriers/dreads lots of cyno battlecruisers and cyno battleships and plenty of cyno frigates... only one cyno rorqual..now they are relics. ill remove their cynos when have moar time and welp few
---
I have a bunch of those too, but they should not be missed. Quick, easy travel is personally convenient, but a poor game mechanic. The fact that you could not interdict a Cyno Interceptor is very poor gameplay.
---
&gt; why should one side have every advantage?
---
Exactly. So you agree that local is hugely imbalanced and should stay gone, right? The ratter already has many advantages - safe spots to warp onto tether, friends nearby, intel channels, the ability to scout gates or watch for new sigs. Telling them exactly when someone who might be a threat enters the system gives them the immediate intel advantage too.
---
No it doesnt. PLEX can for one be tampered with (speculation), which happens quite often, CCP can give out free SP or have sales. It is in fact the only thing that is controlled more by outside factors than inside so by no means is it an good indicator for inflation.
---
The CPI however is. And not everything in the game comes from Rorqs, belive it or not.
---
Seems like a viable direction to go in.
---
&gt; Eve is a sandbox. I can use the tools at my disposal to pick a pace I like. 
---
Then please do and stop thinking people are playing the game the game wrong because they don't play like you.
---
&gt; But *you* want the safe space, so...? 
---
I don't want the safe space, I stopped krabbing a long time ago and have enough riches to last for a long time. I just wonder why people like you feel like people should not be able to make their space safe from your low effort gangs.
---
&gt; Basically yes. 
---
Oh dear.
---
&gt; Have you convinced yourself that just because the numbers on your ship are bigger, you've somehow progressed to a different part of the game? 
---
Have you convinced yourself that because you think frigate pvp is your endgame, people will do the same ? Goddammit these people.
---
Fix conflict drivers, change a lot of citadel mechanics, remove rorq mining, change sov.
---
Pretty sad to see the same player who whined about stagnation whine about blackout being bad.  Isn't this community supposed to be hardcore? How come a single change results in so many tears
---
Not gonna say anything on citadel and timezone tanking, I think we all agree that it is retarded as fuck.
---
As for krabbing... making the ns anomalies a lot like wormhole would be a start, bigger payouts but more risk involved. Let capitals enter the field with capital escalation mobs spawning (with heavy scram and such) would be more engaging and more risky. Tier the anomalies a lot like wormhole difficulty so some can be done by newbros in myrm, other by groups of people.
---
You cannot do the same as wormhole region respawn because you're comparing a wormhole system where regions exists but are not connected most of the time, with every system habited by other entities or completely empty to a sov system where. But you can prevent the mass injection of ISK by giving LP + overseer/blue loots/whatever instead of bounties, forcing people to move their stuff to HS to sell it, giving people a chance to destroy/loot the hauler.
---
As for mining, reduce all asteroid size by 90-95% and add more asteroids to get the same ore quantity, remove all mining drones and force people to use lasers so they have to change target often, tuned to prevent people to use more than one or two rorquals at a time, like super ratting cannot be multiboxed. Tune all mining ships so they don't feel useless (5b rorqual doing 100M an hour and that cannot be multiboxed is not worth the price, Hulks are already shitty to use, etc) and removed retarded modules (PANIC anyone ?).
---
Stop changing things, this constant need to tweak and fiddle was the most annoying thing for me. Just leave it alone, Eve was supposed to be a player driven sandbox, not a dev environment.
---
i think you underestimate "one thing" .. basicaly it took away subcap money making in null that in turn took away warm bodies in fleet when the FC calls for it. its incredibly short sighted to think that the PVE going on in null is not supporting PVP
---
&lt;3 Lazerhawk
---
Not gonna happen with the current crew
---
&gt; For us to put them in a position where they can't try to fix the game in it's current state is upsetting.
---
They put themselves there by making very drastic changes without gathering player feedback (CSM) first.
---
The list of things they did wrong (non exhaustive), that lead to this:
---
- Skill injectors without limitations, so everyone can fly the biggest toys
---
- Citadel spam with broken safety features
---
- Fozzie sov that nobody wants to engage in
---
- Capital multiboxed mining with complete safety
---
- ...
---
If they had listened to the CSM about these things and if they had put more thought into their changes, it wouldn't have come to the current state.
---
Will CCP be worse off?
---
I'm not talking about actual hunters. I respect them. But most of the leet pvp bois I see aren't that group they are the cloakys or dscan immune ships just hanging out in system waiting for an easy kill. Hell I don't mind being dropped, it means I messed up but when Ive been ratting for several hours or doing DED sites in a combat capable ship no one even shows up but 2 different times that I can think of I have been jumped the second I switch to an easy kill ship.
---
I missed Recons, thanks.
---
Sry 4 my bad eng, but... OMFG First really good post about blackout. It was a really nice idea to drop local in null.
---
1. No bots, cuz bots must die. (It looks like Albion Online, I don't see any of bots there)
---
2. As u say reduce the inflation... after blackout is gone, I think plex slowly be raised up to 3kkk.
---
3. A lot of PVP content. U know, null sec shouldn't be safe. If capsuleer wanna be safe - go highsec.
---
4. If inflation is reduced - farming in null will be more profitable (cuz bounty for pirates head not changed at all and fraction and deadspace modules will rise in price due to its rarity), but still dangerous.
---
5. BIG power blocks like TAPI, GOONS, NC, PL, FRAT etc... they should change their doctrine. No more cap umbrellas in 1 system. Thats why, with local - system renters and bots just farming fully safe. They don't need defender fleet. They just docked when enemy fleet will be at 10 jumps. With local it's probably impossible. It's mean that u need cap umbrellas in each region u own, otherwise the region don't farm at all. No money for rent (cuz nobody rent the systems in regions without def fleet), and limited resources in home region... I think if the big pow blocks don't change their doctrine - they will die.
---
But blackout is gone =( Wellcome back to null bots and crying crabs. And Wellcome back inflation.
---
Why don’t you realise the simple truth, had they held their course they would have continued to lose people and there would be no EVE? 
---
They brought local back because they had no choice, their playerbase was disappearing, ccp are a business and eve needs paying players to exist, when you lose 1000s of subs over 8 weeks what else could they do?
---
You must realise that any successful game must appeal to the majority not the minority!
---
Htfu is not an argument, adapt or die is not an argument the only option they had was to roll back, 
---
I just hope the damage can be recovered
---
Why so you can know my main and where I live . Nope...I don't  dislike blackout. I personally think they took it a little for but I adapted to it. I can't adapt to cloaky ship or dscan immune ship sitting in system waiting for an easy kill. That's all I am saying. So you can take my word or not but I have no reason to lie about it because BO didn't stop me from playing I just adapted and did what I need to do. You know adapt or die/ HTFU. Did that now its back to whatever CCP decides to do again. I'm still in space doing my thing.
---
&gt;I  just wonder why people like you feel like people should not be able to make their space safe from your low effort gangs.
---
​They should, they should just not get that intel and safety for free, which is local.
---
&gt;Have you convinced yourself that because you think frigate pvp is your endgame, people will do the same ? 
---
No. I can respect people picking different playstyles, I can't respect people saying they're entitled to free stuff. Like intel or a certain isk/hour rate.
---
The fact that I'm fine with a frigate and you're not because you've set a different goal, doesn't mean I can't exploit the situation to my advantage because you have the idea that you're entitled to safety.
---
I don't think you're playing the game wrong, I think you're complaining about a situation with no basis to stand on.
---
&gt;pubbie
---
link SA acct
---
&gt; I'm increasingly thinking we should try instanced PvP in Abyssal sites,
---
No, fuck off.
---
The reason we have so many PvP supers is that its much harder to haze a super than just a normal carrier with a ganking fleet, giving you more time to get your rescue in. The cyno changes reinforce that. Rorqs are working because of panic allowing you to get help. On the other hand the gankers adapted by just coming with monstrous bomber fleets to kill supers etc before the help arrives. So its some kind of arms race of who is faster, the 20 help HAW dreads/supers/titans or the 250 bombers. The current gank meta also just favors extreme responses. You need to force off 250 bombers. How do you do it? Build a Muninn fleet? Eagles? Destroyers? Bring 200 dudes? Nah, just drop HAWelations and HAWatars with some supers for tackle, you don't need that many people, deal more damage and have enough range to force them out of their Torpedo range.
---
Like for fixing it how about more incentives to not just sit in a single region? Like Goons literally built an empire without having to leave the super range of their Staging.
---
Elo is 2 weeks from being sectioned due to his playtime. Not sure USA tax payers wanna see him sat on his fat ass much longer tbh
---
I've said in other posts that i don't want free intel for any side. local and the black out give massive advantages thus a need for a balanced version.  TBH making it balanced is going to be hard, i've had a few ideas that i was going to put forward but when reviewing them they where not balanced so i scaped them.
---
That's right. Or even worse a group of people whom discovered The Infinity Gauntlet and keep using it...poorly....stupidly...
---
What? Are you serious? Recovered to what? To steady decline? All the people that quit should have stayed like that. All thaf CCP needed to was to make game more appealing to new players. But they had yo cave in because they are no longer independent company and PA does not care about the health of the game. Black Desert is the prime example here. It is a P2W shit. All they care about is the cash they earn from their game. And people with 50 subs and bots are better for this compared 10 real people with single account each.
---
CCP is fixing the issue and brining back local. Wait till monday and you can tell friends that they can come back to EVE.      
---
Some will maybe do, some don't but at least we will recover some of the lost players.            
---
^(all pun intended)
---
Give us a semi-blackout that will be good for krabs and pve, good for pvp, and that does not give the players in null an impression of emptiness. 
---
In essence a counter that keeps track of the number of pilots in the current system without revealing who they are. Those players who belong to the same corp / alliance should have their own local chat window.
---
Here is my original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d45b4h/how_to_make_a_future_blackout_work/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Retard
---
It's something people don't realize, citadels have added so much safety to every single system.
---
And with them being so hard to kill it's not even like you can do much about them to force an engagement.
---
Look at the bigger picture and not just "krab bad pvp good"
---
- Decloak delay is 5 seconds with max skills, then you have a minimum of 2 seconds to actually lock a target.
---
- Why can't you stay aligned? Your mining range on a rock is big enough to burn towards other rocks, pings, celestials and structures nearby.
---
- You can't fight the loki solo in your barge of course but that's why we play Eve in corps, so you can have friends (or alts?) online in a combat response fleet.
---
We would like to help CCP and a number of us tries everyday to explain why they were not wrong with the recent changes but why it was wrong to do it like this.
---
CCP doesn't know how to balance things, and to iterate on it. They have to learn that first, but they have to be willing.
---
People in Eve don't want new content right now, they want to fix the old one, but CCP is hellbent in sticking to their roadmap, change that. Like one of my colleague once said about the app we were maintaining, this is putting garbage over garbage. 
---
Why did recent changes failed ? Too massive in one shot, for a first, and absolutely horrendous communication from CCP. Falcon said how he viewed the game, and while he is entitled to his views and expose it, some people took it at face value and thought CCP was going in the same direction, which was imssible to begin with.
---
CCP never explained were they wanted to go with this "eRa OF cHAOs", just "trust us we'll shake things up", which is completely wrong to do : Nobody trust CCP with iteration anymore. They have to prove they can do it before we can even think about putting our trust in them, that's sad but that's the reality.
---
/u/ccp_falcon please pass this insight to whoever needs it : Please continue forward with your idea of shaking things up, but please do it in a completely open way, announce what you want to achieve, use focus groups and CSM to help you decide how and when to implement changes when you need it, communicate about it and stay focused on iterating on it instead of letting things rot.
---
People didn't dislike the blackout because they're dirty krabs that don't want any risk, they dislike the way it was implemented. People don't hate the cynos changes because they think it wasn't needed, they hate it because it was done in the worst way possible.
---
If you try to do it any other way, it will never work. Trust me, I do change management for a living (lol trusting random people on the internet).
---
Since CCP had a "Let's remove local and see what happens" moment, how about "Let's halve the amount of anoms/ore" moment?
---
Lmao cause the games in such a good spot to just be left alone.
---
This community hasn't been hardcore in a very long time, as hardcore both takes effort and is hard to squeeze in inbetween picking up kids and mowing the lawn. Ideally the actual gameplay is perfectly balanced inbetween requiring minimum actual effort/risk and still letting you feel how tough you are to get by out there.
---
Yeah I don't see any point in bulls hitting, people tend to see right through it, I also don't care much at all when some nerd tries to put me down cos my killboard isn't as good as theirs we don't all live and breath pvp.
---
I play with a really nice bunch of people so I could not care less what some wannabe elitist nerd thinks.
---
never not blame the legacy code
---
aye p much my exact situation.
---
Yes the statics can be good money makers. But the C2's and 1's sites aside from relic/data are not great.
---
Sandbox without boundaries is just a desert.
---
Delay local by 60 seconds from jump in. Gives the hunter time to load grid, d-scan and warp to a site. But not enough time to set up a bomb/spearfishing run(well, you can get lucky on the initial warp in) or warp in for a fleet following(well, again you can get lucky on the initial warp in).
---
Dont change cloaks. Im fine with getting camped, and i like my own cloaky eyes.
---
Remove cynos from caps and supers and leave them on everything else. Local available only to systems that have some kind of structure that can be blown up pretty easy. Remove the ability to use ansiblex while bubbled or tackled. Remove asset safety. Make blackout a incursion effect. Make nerfs so it keeps a sense of progressive risk n reward from high to wh.
---
You're probably right.  But look around you mate.  The game is already dead, so what's the problem, other then It's still milkable of human wealth.  Because  It's still the best game ever, but it has too many balance problems and uncorrected issues left to fester.  
---
The two most heinous are lack of pvp due to n+1 mechanics.  Alliances and standings lists need deleted too.  Ship balance and the loss of 'T1' pvp are apart of those.  
---
There are thousands of people, like me, who won't play again unless they are fixed.  I have 100 billions in assets sitting collecting dust that would all get deleted and I would cheer, because I know the most fun I had in Eve were T1 brawls.  Once you get into expensive ships, you just get risk averse.
---
Go to the nullblocs and you can get supers stupid cheap. Fit hel for 17bil
---
A structure to disable cloak? No, that's a ridiculous idea.
---
subbed because of blackout..time to unsub again :)
---
Wormhole salvage and T3C doctrines are another victim of the Triglavian OPness, particularly in small gang scenarios. Everyone flies Drekavacs or Leshaks now.
---
Remove rorq mining full stop. They should be command ships and protect mining barges.
---
He's talking about age not IQ
---
I am not saying that though. It is the people who krab with their tens of bots and alts that are bad. CCP can not and will not ever fix botting. If they could they would already have. Blackout extremely lowered the income of bots. There were still there, but their effects was lowered. Just look at the PLEX prices right after the announcement. Inflation is caused mostly by bots.
---
http://www.searivercorp.com/natuvitta/double-omega-3.htm
---
&gt;What would you, as an Eve player, think should be done NOW by CCP to improve Eve's current, and most importantly, future situation ?
---
Maybe it's to admit that CCP has lost control of the situation:
---
 * They can't go forward or back without burning people.
---
 * They don't know what to do, last time they decided on a course of action that sounded promising it didn't work, it backfired
---
IMHO: Fork it.
---
If 10 people have 11 opinions on how it should work, and they refuse to play unless the game is pretty much precisely what they want, let them have a try.
---
Leave the core of it in place. Most of the static values, like drop tables, mission rewards, bounties, skill requirements, invuln timers, etc. should be in some dumb database. There is no reason why we can't fork that and tweek it ourselves.
---
Admit that goons won, if that's something they care about and hit the big red reset button.
---
So people that quit should never come back?
---
ccp hasn't been an independent company for years, if it wasn't PA it was the banks/investors who all want to make money. 
---
they tried something it wasn't working it diodn't bring people in maybe people came back but hey according to you they should stay quitted or are you only talking about those that quit that don't play like you do?
---
Hey at least wow players dont cry about getting ganked in STV without local. Kek
---
Resources that provide new tools are cool in a sandbox. The point is that for the vast expanses of space that there is it seems there could be more unique resources, in my opinion.
---
Just the other day we saw a whole fleet consisting of loki's and stratios with a couple proteuses tossed in. Another group we're close with mainline lokis.  
---
It seems that players like to throw around words such as 'stagnation' but then don't come up with fresh ideas. And with possible changes to wh space coming up now would be a great time to discuss what could be added in the future.
---
I voted with my wallet. Let's be real changes ware too much tooo fast. All here want eve to grow and support CCP but this is not way to do it.
---
Now go and run to your mummy and ask her if you did a funny post &lt;3
---
Anybody who left just because of the blackout/experiment just emphases how bloody soft some null secers can be. Moaning cos they can’t afk their way to statistic fame. Games are meant to be played not afk’d!
---
I'm really sad. As a new player of 2 year experience. I really enjoyed this evolution. Now I'm sad that the game become "too safe" again
---
A mobile structure? Just like mobile cyno inhibitors. Or mobile warp bubble. Don't see how that wouldn't be available lorewise in the far future. Technologically advanced to revive dead capsuleers but damn we can't disable cloaks? Please.
---
[Every day you can learn something new](https://godmodeuser.com/files/2018-05/keyboard-with-printscreen-button-marked.png)
---
Surely they’d just be allowed to die and then deployed again as soon as it was needed. 
---
No thanks this doesn’t sound very well thought  out.
---
Well they've been told way too many times. Citadels - skill injectors - almost unlimited resources.
---
For sure Trigs made certain that T3C's were killed off. But the initial killing was done by the re balance. I get CCP saying they want T3's to be flexible but no one in EVE flies ships like that. You choose and fit for a certain scenario. I'm not going to fly a ship that can do 3 things at 60% (after some in space refit fuckery) when I can own 3 ships that each do one thing at 100%.
---
You could spam POS' the same they spam citadel's only limited by the number of moons in a system.
---
&gt; ​They should, they should just not get that intel and safety for free, which is local. 
---
And I agree with you on local. I disagree that the current implementation is good, that's all. But safety in nullsec isn't free.
---
&gt; No. I can respect people picking different playstyles, I can't respect people saying they're entitled to free stuff. Like intel or a certain isk/hour rate. 
---
People are not entitled to free stuff or isk/hour. You just have to balance things so people don't feel the game like a second and third job, and so people stay in the game when they come in that 17 years old game when there are massive fleets of ships everywhere.
---
&gt;The fact that I'm fine with a frigate and you're not because you've set a different goal, doesn't mean I can't exploit the situation to my advantage because you have the idea that you're entitled to safety.  
---
&gt;I don't think you're playing the game wrong, I think you're complaining about a situation with no basis to stand on.
---
But I'm not complaining, you are. And you're damn right to complain, be it only because I can't take your right to do that away and would never do it, but because this game need change. Not the way it has been done recently, but it still needs it.
---
But you cannot complain saying you think people feel entitled and you are not. Everyone feels entitled to something, and CCP as a game developer has to balance things out to keep their game afloat, that's what it's all about, not petty rivalry between dirty nullsec krabs and psycopath small gangers.
---
Remove nullification, remove warp core stabs, remove warp to 0 while we are at it. Nice and balanced. And increased align time of all ships by 10sec.
---
CCP said themselves they wouldn't care if they lost players in the short term. That they worry about the health of the game in the long term. And they cave in in a month? 
---
Yes all those cancerous people should have quit and new blood should have been injected. They just were not able to wait a few months more because of PA and all the ultra krabs and bot alts unsubbing.
---
My ratting nestor costs over a billion.... it has always cost over a billion and it's always run in packs in C5's. If you triple or quad box you can make just under a billion an hour. Split it with the fleet you're making over 300 mil an hour.
---
My solo gila was 160 million at minumum and ran sites that paid 30 million every 20 minutes... so 90 million. Until it ran out of sites. That respawn over days not minutes.
---
So, yeah. You're right. we don't fly in 100 mil ships and we can make over 300 mil an hour if we either multibox and pay attention or fly in a fleet with others. Our balance system is different then yours and while C5's are too profitable good luck spending an entire day in your home system ratting with 200 other people. The ability to lock down a hole though is something that wormholers complain about and agree is a bad thing.  
---
Unlike Null we are willing to hurt our income in order to get content.
---
I guess I feel entitled to a somewhat well defined playing field, yes.
---
&gt;I'm not entirely sure how to manage it, but we need a PvE overhaul that removes this duality. 
---
Impossible in a sandbox. 
---
The hordes of humans will form a community and always go to its natural state -- protect against it's enemies.  It's a core nature of humanity, us vs them.  
---
So until you remove humans from the equation, no matter what mechanic you make in an open sandbox MMO -- you will always have prey forming response fleets to fight against hunters. You will always have hunters complaining that they have less friends and should be entitled to kill the prey easier who have more friends.
---
Rorqual's are still ships I haven't really faced in all my years in this game. I'm curious though, are they always this fucking hard to down? I mean, realistically, how many ships do you need to bring to down one? This is insane they are this tough as a mining ship.
---
Yeah it reduced botting in null but it also removed legitimate players ability to rat, which CCP couldn't continue along with.
---
Blackout was to extreme but so is no blackout, I just hope CCP aren't just going to stop making changes.
---
Well, when I first got into lowsec I did actually stage a bunch of stuff in Rapakas, just a couple jumps from Asakai. Finding fights in that area didn't feel any different than near Amamake.
---
Perhaps limits on structures in system tied to a combination of TruSec &amp; SovLevel with a Constellation maximum.
---
What
---
Hm.. better fit some tank modules and have a couple friends in comms while you krab. Or you can go to highsec where you can mine to your hearts content and mission run all day. Hell go do some incursions.
---
&gt;This resulted in krabbers leaving a single frigate still alive so that it would respawn at downtime and thus raiders would have to enter your system and do the sites to make them spawn in their system. This created skirmishes, war and such between parties living in the same constellation.
---
Not to be a dick but this was not why that was done.
---
We kept single rats alive in sites at high-end wormholes because it would reload the option to escalate the site with capitals after downtime, for a maximum of four days in a row. These escalations were the 75% of the income, and thus were to be protected.  
---
That they didn't spawn in other systems was important, but not the driving reason behind the practice.
---
I saw once a 62 sig wh, i jumped back
---
it's fake?
---
Constellation based local is probably even stronger then normal local.
---
except all of these things were brought to CCP's attention through the CSM as well.
---
1 - fully agree i don't think anyone would disagree
---
2 - others have posted better ways to deal with this.
---
3 - null sec is only safe due to the players policing it 
---
4 - yes but like in point 2 others have better idea for this
---
5 - doctrines change all the time. also you complan at capital umbrellas then say people dock so they don't need defending what one is it 
---
right now ccp needs to make a balanced intel system and not one that is free for one side or the other
---
Blackout was always a trial
---
  Cynos are no doubt staying put. I suspect they always wanted to do it this way- notice the old dominion trailer - a stealthy cruiser lighting the first cyno.
---
Well I would agree, but CCP is not a non-profit association, so they have to somehow keep Eve alive and going, which is not going to work well if they piss off their playerbase too much.
---
&gt; The two most heinous are lack of pvp due to n+1 mechanics. Alliances and standings lists need deleted too. Ship balance and the loss of 'T1' pvp are apart of those. 
---
That the issues you think are the most important (I don't say they aren't), but probably not the same as others.
---
Also N+1 mechanics exists in every game outside of instanced PvP, and Eve doesn't need it outside of AT (bring back the AT CCPls). And N+1 is not the end of everything.
---
&gt; There are thousands of people, like me, who won't play again unless they are fixed. I have 100 billions in assets sitting collecting dust that would all get deleted and I would cheer, because I know the most fun I had in Eve were T1 brawls. Once you get into expensive ships, you just get risk averse. 
---
Maybe that's you case, but not for the majority of people, which is the whole problem. You cannot advocate for drastic changes in one go, because that will never be accepted by the playerbase (look at blackout and cyno changes for a fine example of this).
---
You need iteration, you need to prepare the players, compensate something with something else, so they don't feel robbed of their money and time.
---
Tbh at this point I wouldn't mind starting from scratch on new server without capitals, citadels, asset safety and other stupid ccp moves in last years. I really doubt current eve could be somehow fixed
---
and people like YOU want content spoon fed to you for no risk, effort, or time involved.  Who is the REAL person wanting a safe space?
---
True.
---
However, a greater amount of destruction leads to a greater amount of resources being needed, which in turn devalues ISK and reduces the practical benefits of certain PVE activities. When I started a PLEX was 300m. But as the ratting improved, the required cash (and thus time/effort) rose as well.
---
Null. Security.
---
Cyno changes will be rolled back? omg no
---
Capital and citadel spam ruins the game. It needs to be nerfed.
---
It didn't reduce ratting for alliances. It reduced solo ratting capabilities. Which should not have been even possible in the first place in MMO. Just group up with other players and rat in PvP fleets or have standing defense fleet. Have scouts and then share the income. And now the income is a lot less you say? That was the point. It greatly reduced inflation because now earning ISK was not easy. It was group effort and that increased the value of it. It also made you socialize in a MMO. Now we are back to farmville.
---
Omg train scanning skills and buy virtue set o\

Ofc whining on reddit is easier
---
If w-space is hard for you, gtfo then
---
A health predator system is already there, change the basic rules of the game is dumb (like local or cyno) because it affects the freedom of each player, which is the only thing important in this SANDBOX game (not pve or pvp game). 
---
Let's look our recent past, how was null 4 or 5 years ago? In the "ishtar online" era?
---
It was before injectors and citadels, rorquals were only boosters, there was local and almost no one was ratting in carrier even if it was a lot easier with the previous fighters mechanics, and every alliance applied fines if you get caught ratting in carrier. 
---
Why? Because caps were precious, they were expensive and there were very few characters trained for it compared to now. 
---
Why spent a lot of SP for something you will use maybe one or two times a year? 
---
If you want to put your ass on a super or a titan there was no place in Eve were you can dock, you have to commit a toon specifically for that purpose, and you have to train for a looooong time to only match the skill requirements, and no one will ever put that investment in danger by sitting in a ratting anomaly or with a cheap fit or without the proper skill level (which raises a lot the effective skill requirements). 
---
Why spend a lot of SP for something which
---
I mean...
---
I want to be able to find a situation where I can poke pve-ers and miners and null, maybe kill one, maybe get killed by their defense. I wouldn't call that no risk and no time involved.
---
The amount of effort it is or should be on my side is debatable.
---
1. Undo rorquals         
---
2. Make industry index constellation wide - so you don't put few structures in every system to have lower tax           
---
3. Undo moon mining change turn athanors in auto mining units with 24h timer
---
Because the first time you made this post went so well? Fuck off retard.
---
That sounds un-EVE but fun as hell.
---
Yeah me two had 3 alts i was going to resub too. Guess they got cold feet
---
Do you think they'll come today?
---
Well maaaaybe if you'd said something before that nonbinary diversity hire turned the thing into farmville and drove half the players away. Whoops. Painted yourself into a corner now haven't you. Too late, only the carebears remain. Congratulations to Hilmar though on scamming the Koreans and offloading this lemon onto them.
---
People forget that CCP had a focus group that they used of people in-game who knew alot about game mechanics. That group told them under no illusions that they cannot release the rorqual the way it was, it tanked to much, panic was retard strong, mined a little to much and was a retarded way that you skilled into from current industrial/mining skill tree.
---
CCP ignored it all and released it in their vision....and we all know how retarded ccps vision seems to be. It got nerfed eventually and again and again so here we are.
---
Fozzie soz was told the same that it was shit but they never listened.
---
Skill injectors were also called out as shit but everyone knew it was a shameless EA style cash grab and there is never going to be anything we will ever be able to do about it.
---
Bottom line is CCP is a company and they want to milk as much cash from us as possible the way every company does untill it hurts their pockets they won't do shit. Blackout hit their pockets hard it seems so they are doing something. Speak with you wallet/purse if you want to change shit with them.
---
To get that tank, they'll be switching to nadoes/talos'. its about the value of the items vs their thrashers/cataylsts.
---
Not a bad idea and step forward. Should be one per type — forts are less important than a tatara in some cases.
---
There's a "simple" solution:
---
1. We remove the asset safety option to be in the same system, OR we limit it to the same time as low-security space. You're ought to defend your space or temporarily get locked out of the assets.
---
2. Asset safety makes you pay a fine to get your items. I propose that we take a percentage of that value, say 50%, to be paid out within a day or two after a structure kill to those who hit it and blew it up. Imagine your structure holds 1T and at 20% tax you have 200b of an "ISK SINK". Now imagine splitting 100B over the aggressors.
---
3. There should be a hard limit to the amount of structures per system, based on an easily understood mechanism. For example; 1 structure per 2 moons excluding POCO's.
---
cursed comment please stop
---
Like highsec isn't dangerous, lole.
---
Also people have friends in comms, that's called the supercapital umbrella.
---
Im saying hes completely wrong!! ccp should mould changes around the majority of your playerbase not the minority(whrs/cloaky campers), its obvious! they lose tons of subs, roll back and apparently they are kneeling? they are a for profit organisation losing their playerbase is not profitable, its the opposite! discuss ideas with the csm or the general playerbase and make changes that the majority will support and that might also benefit the game in the long term!
---
From tomorrow dt, I'll log in all my alpha and omega accounts just to press this button.
---
I liked blackout, but to say that only krabs, botters and RMTers liked local is incorrect.
---
It was good while it lasted. For the 1st time i felt like eve was going hardcore and challenging again.
---
I feel a bit depressed knowing that no more radical changes are going to be made in the future.
---
Maybe its time for the few of us left to follow our brothers in afk hybernation dunno really.
---
This community is full of weak and softcore players that dont satisfy my taste.
---
A kiss with an iceberg.
---
Teabag
---
From tomorrow DT im afraid you go back to school kid... And you ll have tones of homework. Cyu next summer son o7
---
Lol no
---
&gt;Undock, get out, find some targets and start shooting.
---
when ccp make it worth my while, i will.
---
that's literally all they have to do to 'fix' eve.
---
make it worth my time to undock and go and shoot other players, cos right now i can't think of a single goddamn reason why i'd need to do that.
---
I don't disagree with any of that except blackout.  We don't know, but we can be fairly sure all the salt was from null bears, who are the very thing op was correct about.  Elite pve is what Eve is about now.  And for every bear there are multiple pvpers that already quit because the state of pvp is fucked.
---
Going back on the cyno changes will cement the death of the game.
---
I hope so.
---
The same players do not. Different people whine. Also, people who think the game is stagnant might not agree with the exact solution to the problem. I enjoyed blackout, but I always thought there would be a better solution than simply removing local. 
---
Kinda going to miss blackout though.
---
Nobody put them in a position, they did this themselves  — people paid to live in null and not in wormholes. CCP thought by making everyone a wormholer it would be okay for people to keep paying. Bait and switch creates an issue with any consumer.
---
Yes there are always things to do to rile things up but do not remove the product you sold and switch it for another — it’s not an adapt or die scenario, they are paying consumers so the right mantra was actually “give my product back or I will not pay for it”.
---
The way numbers were going they wouldn’t have any players left in a few months! Are you blind to the fact numbers went off a cliff since blackout! Oh wait wow classic back to school.... give your head a wobble! They were in a death spiral, why is that so hard for people like you to accept!
---
this.
---
it's not a fucking mining ship, it never was, and it shouldn't be.
---
Scarcity is definitely an element that drives conflict, but I wouldn't call it kicking over sandcastles as that's an immature act for immature people.
---
Conflict just for entertainment (which is fine as a premise for a game) has to be balanced with the people who do not seek out such conflict (it is a sandbox after all).
---
Then there's conflict based on capturing and harvesting resources, which is a legitimate goal and use for conflict, but isn't enough for the thrill-seekers because it has a lot of boring guarding or patrolling.
---
the problem is you can't pair together a miner and a fighter because their goals are completely different, which means you're just annoying the miner by adding things that means the miner needs protection, or you're annoying the fighter for having to boringly guard the miner.
---
I definitely see resource limitations as an interesting venue though, the question is whether it can be done within the parameters that fulfill the thrill-seekers as much as the castle-builders.
---
Kind of their own fault, it's been going in this direction for years. 
---
They've been living large off the injector and plex sales and only now realise it's killing the game.
---
Idk, maybe this is the wake up call they needed, they'll probably have to cut people.
---
Ultimately it's their decision to make, make less money and focus more on building the game for the people who play it or continue down this path and get as much out of it before it eventually collapses.
---
Weak attempt at trolling but for the sake of others.
---
I regularly scan down 20+ sig systems, I just don't for shattered wh's as there is no point. People straight don't go through these systems so scanning and bookmarking sites for potentially catching prey later isn't worth the time. It's more worthwhile to scan down 4-5 other systems.
---
Removing unused sites makes these systems looks less annoying to deal with and increased statics makes them into neat neutral ground crossroad systems.
---
And from every other place you can imagine. CCP just did not listen.
---
Despite the endless speculation, none of us really know because CCP never actually said.
---
&gt; CCP stated it was temporary so they could measure demographics.
---
I have seen nothing to that effect, and what "demographics" could be measured with removing local?
---
The problem is if the reward is too good, people will just sit around blowing up their alts.
---
i'd love to see reasources change 
---
i have an r64 i've mined it a few time oh look it lost the r64 ores but now has r32, 16, 8, 4 or no moon ores only standard ores random change 
---
Ore sites to respawn slower to  get a small 24 hours then after 60 hour it becomes a med site after 75 hours it becomes a large and after 1 week an extra large no longer do you get all 5 sites in one system just 1 that changes over time 
---
Ice belts respawn rate changed to every 8 hours 
---
NPC changes that a full topic on its own that i'll post another day
---
&gt;If shit is cheap then its cheap.
---
I quit the game ages ago when PLEX went over 1 billion.
---
\&gt; If shit is cheap then its cheap. 
---
Has it come down in price since then?
---
In the next six months? No.
---
In the next three years? Absolutely.
---
&gt;the same they spam citadel's 
---
How is it the same if you in same sentence said that were limited by moon numbers? If you link citadels and engineering complexes to planets they would be even more limited, 1 Keepstar per alliance.
---
Having balls and ride out a wave of negativity, sadly they won't do that.
---
Remove multiaccount.
---
They also don't stay in Stranglethorn everyday trying to defend it either.
---
&gt;I suspect the entire   
---
&gt;premise  
---
&gt; of ratting and mining anomalies will need to go, replaced by some sort of very different activity. 
---
remove all isk bounties and all isk generation from blues/agents.
---
Every people who activates a sub or a skill queue gets 1B isK
---
Im going to go out on a limb and say - Because people would instantly farm their alts for rewards. Eve is an insane alternate character game and any PVP rewards would be farmed to excessive degrees.
---
Yeah let's become Serenity. Where are we gonna go when we get there?
---
Roll back cyno changes. Then put a hard cap on structure count per system (1 XL per star, 1 L per planet, 1 M per moon) Then reduce structure and sov grind. Then actually balance ships and modules. 
---
To be fair, it wasn't the black out shit that I hated as a crab and running logistics and industry, it was the cyno changes. 
---
The blackout hurt my new bro friends more than it hurt me.
---
Well, a lot were bears, no doubt, they are the most impacted by blackout. But there's also a lot of people that understood it wasn't the right change for the game, or at least not the way it was done.
---
I honestly don't care about having local or not, but I feel that's not balanced if there is no other changes to compensate. But I shouldn't care, I'm not ratting or mining. But I still do because I understand how people works.
---
Goonswarm Keepstar Alliance 1
---
Goonswarm Keepstar Alliance 2
---
Goonswarm Keepstar Alliance 3...
---
Most of the bots left. A minority moved to high sec where they were *much* less relevant.
---
It's up to ccp to create a game that people want to play, im not going to force myself to play something that isnt fun just so they can try to fix things.
---
Sure you could, but you only had a max of 24 hours to respond. Unlike citadels. How many hours do you get max to respond to a citadel bash before it is destroyed again? I forget, can you tell me please?
---
I honestly think that every time you push the thumbs down button, it pushes any active tickets you have open further down the queue.
---
A rattlesnake makes \~70mil isk/h ratting in null. If you have to pay even 1/3 of that for security then its better to run lvl 4 missions in high sec with almost 0 risk. Only big groups can secure their space cost effectively. Thats why NS outside Goon and test space saw big drop in ratting.
---
Uh, you realize we are set red to PL right?
---
You are doing nothing to help this game with your constant negative posts. You expect them to cater to you when there are so many different types of playstyle - it is difficult to please everyone but at least try and enjoy the game Dave.
---
I also like the idea of a compromise. I have supported that for a while, I have enjoyed blackout and will be sad to see it go.
---
easy enough to find mine, havent done shit since blackout killed the shit i went for, I fc medium to large fights its what I do Im not interested in easy ganks
---
Given the OP, that response is truly ironic.
---
Hey,  
---
bombers and command destroyers still exist.
---
fuck off retard
---
The blackout affected both isk and mineral generation. That means you can't really compare isk against minerals to see the effect.  The only other measures I can think of are the MER, PLEX, and AT ships, which all showed deflation.
---
PLEX went back up the moment blackout ending was announced. You think that was a coincidence?
---
not really, bots carried on either with extra bots on gates scraping the intel of people decloaking or doing other things, bots were still there and still are there. most of the numbers were krabs not being bothered with playing the game due to the extreme bias towards gankers
---
I do them in a Drekavac but have also cleared them in a Rattlesnake and Praxis.  A couple pointers: 
---
1) you will need tank, the first two waves are easy but the last spawn can hit pretty hard. 
---
 2) they love to eat drones.  You can still use a droneboat but will need to keep a close eye to pull them in when needed.  
---
3) these things move fast so you will need good damage application.
---
&gt; it is difficult to please everyone but at least try and enjoy the game Dave.
---
i do.
---
i can only enjoy it as much as ccp are willing to make an enjoyable game, though.
---
i can only drink if i'm led to water.
---
either you are for bots or against them entirely, if youre ok with them being in hi sec then shame on you. although many of them just adapted with scout bots on gates to see people decloaking anyway
---
The blackout mostly solved two giant complaints of players, capital proliferation and bots.
---
But players only wanted those problems solved for *other* people.  What am I supposed to do if I have to PvP to get minerals?
---
Why you reposting your horrible photo...fucking hell.
---
It's because the people in nullsec has changed in response to it being the easiest and safest way to generate wealth in the game.
---
Prior to 2016 players in nullsec were invested in PVP, wars, alliance identity, the politics of nullsec and being part of that machine with industry and empire building, even the carebears and industrialists were a crucial cog and part of a bigger narrative. Nowadays the people in nullsec are the people who turbofarmed level 4 missions in 5b marauder fits and incursions. They aren't there to be a part of the scenery, they're there for themselves because its the fastest way to "level up" your character.
---
Few quick thoughts regarding Blackout:
---
How i'd like to see it:
---
* Blackout should be standard in Nullsec;
---
* Structures should be required to create a local (I'd make it 15-30second delayed);
---
* The structures should be one set 24 or 48hour timer with no DPS Cap;
---
* The structures should have a fuel cost, but shouldn't be too cost prohibitive in upkeep or manufacturing;
---
* Cost must be on the side of defenders;
---
Reasoning:
---
* I think this creates more unique differences in the empires that players can create, their decisions affect how their space actually looks/feels;
---
* local was too strong previously and this gives the ability to roaming gangs/interceptors to come in, find a target and create content with targets who aren't paying attention;
---
* No DPS cap should actually encourages caps to be used. These structures aren't valuable to sov/manufacturing/ADMs, but individual bearing. IF they're being attacked, notices should go out and that should encourage krabbers to react. It's a security risk to have local drop, it's a financial risk to players. However, put lots of HP in these and give attackers incentive to use caps/supers. If you have 10 sieged dreads in your system, is it yours? Let's reincentivize capital fights, capital usage and the instances where things can escalate to a "I was there" moment. 
---
   * Conversely, if you look at Delve, this would give their insurgents incentive to individual and selectively incap systems for weekend blops campaigns etc. and forces an upkeep for defenders if you want a fully secure region.
---
   * There needs to be incentive to use caps, but enough flexibility to give small gangs something to achieve. Knocking out 4-5 systems of Local should be attainable with a small gang. This provides an immediate incentive to small gangs who can push for escalations and content beyond killing afk ratters.
---
   * There could be two types of structures:
---
      * 1) Low Cost system wide that can be incapped with a small gang
---
      * 2) higher cost structure that will create local in adjacent systems (high fuel cost/hp)
---
* The goal in most instances is to shut off local to create future content, let these recharge fully if not attacked in their final timer but ignoring them being attacked should result in a penalty. 24-48 with no local if your sensor structure goes into reinforced. Punting these timers makes no sense. 
---
* Ultimately, this should provide more content for both defenders/attackers, incentive some cap use again and hopefully make nullsec more fun.
---
CCP remove excavators and wormholes simultaneously, extreme chemo is needed
---
1: OP doesn't seem to understand how important punctuation is 2: It's a random person, making a random post. Of course it's not real..
---
Its just hard for your opinion to have any credibility. Its like... if the game is not about Cloaky Loki vs Hulk/Bomber Gang vs Rattlesnake then the game is doomed... which is the only thing Blackout enabled.
---
That shit makes zero sense and just seems like you feel entitled to be fed kills by CCP.
---
One day several Gonswarm Keepstar Alliance Ns forget to pay the bill. I am ok with that, make it only anchorable in a capital system, I doubt they would make 100 alliances, but now they can have 1000 Keepstars with 1 alliance even in 1 single system. Improve the game step by step, but in all directions. I love Blackout, but it seems it was too drastic change.
---
&gt;  Now I don't live in NS haven't since just before the black out Im a wher at heart  
---
good your opinion doesnt count, so fuck off
---
First piss off all the crabs. Then make sure to also piss off everyone who liked the changes. Perfect plan. What could possibly go wrong?
---
More transparency and communication with the player base. If they need to take polls to figure out what players want, then do it but transparency is important for people having invested years into the game. 
---
I think for now, instead of making major changes to current features, do minor tweaks whilst adding fresh content to the game as the main package when patches occur. 
---
Players, especially newbros, love free SP. Keep finding ways to give it out to help the newbros get to those ships they sometimes wait months for.
---
CCP didn't think they would have so many players leave i'm sure if they did they would be able to say to PA hey we see a drop of xyz in subs but after x time will have abc new subs and those will out number our losses 
---
did they cave in a month no it was just over 2 months and it isn't a cave in to see your idea isn't working and do a rollback whuile you work on something better more balanced, like i said in other posts local nor the blackout is balanced imo
---
once again you go to insult those that don't play like you do now they are cancerous. You're a toxic player and likely a reason players aren't coming to the game.
---
korea ccp：Daliy reward (Avatar x1)
---
People feel so bad for Falcon. He's the one that made the changes that killed EVE. The blackout and cyno changes were nothing compared to what they could've done not just in the last month but in the last 3 years.
---
Severely restrict skill injectors usage beyond core subcap and support skills.
---
Restrict what citadels can tether and make caps only tether on forts or bigger and supers on keepstars.
---
They talked about having room to increase rewards in null with blackout. Well why the hell didn't they make those changes when they did blackout. Maybe people wouldn't have left the game if CCP hadn't obliterated the risk/reward in null.
---
There are waaaaay too many respawning anomalies in nullsec, especially the colossals and enormous mining anoms. They set up the game mechanics with enough anomalies for like 30,000 players per region, then gave people rorquals that mined ridiculous amounts, then gave us skill injectors to immediately inject more rorqs and supers, then gave us easy mode industry in citadels where a single person could easily build tons of caps, then gave us keepstars with docking supers so it wasn't a pain the ass to own a super. Break any link in that chain and EVE is 10 times as healthy right now.
---
I'm sure everyone has a list of like 50 things that could be changed. We've all been talking about them for years. All CCP could manage was pulling two low effort switches in a database. GTFO. Don't hate  the players, hate the game. CCP, fix the root causes, not the symptoms. Learn to fucking iterate. If your developers hate developing a feature once they've introduced it, fire them and hire some people with passion. Make them play the game.
---
Also, maybe you shouldn't have fired that community team, because you're all dropping the ball hard over and over lately.
---
If only there was like a ship... or even better... a line of subcaps that did a great job of countering faxes
---
Indeed. I think he was the voice of reason.
---
You *could*, but people didn't for several reasons. Not least is that an unfueled POS provides no benefits or protection and is easily destroyed whereas an unfueled citadel provides a free safe harbor and is a royal pain in the ass to destroy.
---
They need to fix :
---
Rorquals
---
Injectors
---
HAW weapons
---
Fighters
---
Capitals should never be efficient in fighting against subcaps. They should used with subcap support against structures and other capitals. 
---
Eve player base has been declining every since the rorqual change and after. Many years of wrong. People leave for other games when they cannot find content. CCP pushed for "strength in numbers" but many eve players are of middle age and do not have time to play whole day of spend hours forming up, waiting for timers and fighting in tidi or getting blueballed after hours of waiting. It is simply not fun nowadays and it gets tired and sick of spending hours  looking for content.
---
Instead CCP should push more for solo/small gang content.  People can have quick and fast fun going solo or a few couple players doing small gang. You simply can't get good content these days going solo or small gang against the capitals spam everywhere. It broken so badly that people just abuse HAW dreads or carriers against solo/small gang subcaps.
---
Sure, people will say adapt or die. People adapt when they leave Eve and play other games and at current situation, eve can't afford this.
---
CCP has been doing it wrong for a long time and I hope they can bring back the fun that made people enjoy playing the game. It is just not fun now.
---
Rolling back blackout with the current cyno mechanics will allow for gathering data on that single effect
---
The way the economy is supposed to be setup is that people who don't like pvp and avoid it do pve to produce things. Meta modules from ratting, modules from lp, minerals and finished ships and modules this sort of thing. 
---
And then people who love to pvp would use those ships modules and things to pvp, blowing all that stuff that was produced up eventually. 
---
The problem arises from the fact that people don't really fight anymore. People used to always be squabbling over something. Today with nothing to fight over they just turtle up and stop fighting through the use of diplomacy. In order to restore the cycle you need to make it so that there are things you need but can't get from your neighbours via diplomacy and a method to attain those things. This means that the defender advantage needs to shrink by A LOT which means a lot less structure grinding gameplay. 
---
This brings us back around to the profitability of pvp. The profitability of pvpers didn't come directly from blowing up their shit. But that will go up too if more destruction happened. But as a war supplier supplying them all the things they need to shoot at. As more shit gets blown up the supply goes down, as people want to blow more shit up demand goes up. And when supply goes down and demand goes up prices soar. This makes producing more profitable and when you do get loot from a pvp encounter its more valuable as well.
---
These parameters are acceptable.
---
So.. here is the risk. 
---
Less people come back because they hear that the blackout has been cancelled.
---
Then those that came back for he PVP centric change now leave and that then cancels out the accounts that returned... 
---
Guess we will know over the next two weeks time..
---
Hey, CCP, listen to this brilliant bastard! Have a damn platinum good sir! Good post!
---
POSes where tied to moons for example and prevented structure spam through this.
---
I envy your insult skills.  
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Blackout was working.  I was super surprised that a company was willing to sacrifice the short-term for the long-term.
---
Turns out they weren't.
---
I would say make it so raitarus and athanors don't allow any ships to tether. Astras only allow subcaps, but maybe not even that. Fortizars only subcaps and caps or only subcaps. Keepstars allow everything to tether. Or maybe no tethering for supers. Or change the cooldown timer on keepstars for supers if they aggress something. 
---
Also, change the timers on astras, they should be like mobile depots. 
---
It still makes me mad that CCP got rid of outposts. I bet people remember stories of dropping an egg in null and running convoys to fill it. All that history down the drain for faction fortizars that mostly got stolen by big blocs.
---
I'm surprised how many people on this sub think someone from outside CCP would run the company and game better than someone who has been with the game since the beginning. We already think that CCP doesnt understand their own game, why would someone new get it? Doesn't seem possible.
---
First of all they nerfed nano! From that point Eve is getting worse and worse, roll back to 2007 post Nanophoon nerf, they can call Eve Classic.
---
It would be hard to make tech 2 ships worth more than the salvage so I dont see that happening.  The real danger would be people getting even more homo about ship losses and tryharding even harder.
---
These guys want what they want and won’t listen to any logic. Blackout didn’t even help new guys at all. With blackout the only real effect was on line members of null groups who ended up feeding cloaked hunters. I love the idea of changes but they need to be less radical more controlled and thought out chaos is not an effective business model.
---
Wrong.
---
POSes needed fuel to operate and setting them up in the initial itteration took long long time.
---
I did setup Strategic POSes during GBC-times and it was a task that took you the better part of a day (on the other side you had something to do while waiting for the next fleet).
---
They needed a lot of management and where points to fight over, so they created content.
---
The carebears won.  That's the reality.
---
Its a magic buttom boiiiii
---
I would actually buy Omega just to see that kind of shit go down
---
The problem is that what is left of the current playerbase is mostly against the changes they made.
---
They did drive the others away a long time ago. So they did shovel their own graves with this.
---
I wouldn't say he's retarded. Just emotional invested.
---
What is it? I can’t find it and have searched for your Reddit username
---
&gt; was it ever meant to be permanent? 
---
* Yes get fucked null bears you useless bots 
---
* Maybe
---
* No it was just a temporary part of the trig invasion story thing
---
* No They are just testing things
---
Pick one. Im not sure, and that might be a problem. It just made me have to go by the worst possibility and make changes accordingly.
---
I was feeling the same. I don't exactly know why but after the announcement I kind of felt a melancholy wash over me. I'm not thinking about unsubbing but my desire to play is just not as amped up as it was. For the first time in a long time the game felt fresh, but now it feels stale again. 
---
I guess it is back to being told to "adapt or die" by Krabs and getting my hardcore gameplay from games like DCS.
---
I'm feeling it now Mr. Krabs.
---
It's not as if Falcon could've been hungover or anything.
---
You literally said that the health of the game was impacted. You then refused to explain how. Maybe having an original thought would be nice but lemmings don't think.
---
That is actually what they are concerned about according to the Berlin meet.
---
Name checks out
---
Thanks for teh post. I think a 2nd account would drive me nuts (part of the reason I am in FW now is because it lets me just focus on one account, after so many years of multiboxing), but I believe I am going to give a militia a spin.
---
you just killed Eve
---
i feel bad for quitting eve when i did, but its far too time consuming to play and go to college. i always loved the dramiel, but solo roaming in null is difficult when you arent great at piloting. the blackout wouldve been perfect for me, and i hate that im one of the numbers in that exodus
---
I look forward to the next dev to take fixing the game seriously. Stop pretending everybody who disagrees with you is a turbo crab. The game was in a shit state and Blackout was just as shit an idea as all the previous ideas that put us here in the first place.
---
Yeah, I play mostly solo now a days and I loved roaming in Null during the blackout, if I saw a blob rolling through and I stayed stealthed they'd never know I was there rather than noticing a neut in local and throwing up bubbles on all the gates for a half hour while I sat there.
---
The problem in my eyes is that players have become complacent in their play style and that was equated to the right amount of fun. Now these have changed, they feel it was an attack on their fun factor and thus decided to Win EVE. 
---
CCP will never get the right balance as it does not exist. If the game is to survive then they need to make Null sec worth fighting for and not building bigger castles...
---
Just my 2 pennies..
---
If FC don't do that most ppl can't follow command especially on multiple language fleet.
---
It's hard to hear on VOD but it's really needed.
---
most people are dumb enough
---
They need to make it so that T3Cs give up a lot more for multiclassing and gain a lot more for specializing.
---
Lol been trying to get that thought out of my head for the last week. It’s like null was turning into a forest full of invisible wolves was how I saw it in my mind but the lion king thing is way more eloquent. Thanks dude
---
&gt;Just group up with other players and rat in PvP fleets or have standing defense fleet. Have scouts and then share the income. And now the income is a lot less you say? That was the point. 
---
Why would anyone do this when L4s, L5s, Incursions, Burners, Abyssals, WHs, DEDs, or literally any other form of PVE exists?
---
EVE is one of the few games where I've actually cried when someone has passed and I've left a few cans in the cemetery over the years so this....gosh...this....the wings and the cyno and the pod with the carvings of people on it the charge effect and then the Ascension of Light...I'm crying just a little because this is perfect.  Thank you CCP for this :)
---
He acts like it's a whole alliance against him when really they're dealing with hundreds of random people twenty four hours a day and there isn't even a centralised PvE strategic asset that they can actually protect. An alliance can work to defend an Incursion fleet. But nobody is going to camp gates twenty four hours a day so somebody else can go and make money. This isn't Jspace. We don't get Jspace rewards.
---
So only 40 account multiboxers could enjoy the industrial path?
---
I suggest another move:
---
- turn injected sp back to injectors, and limit injectors use to less than 5M SP (with a free so remap to adjust sp)
---
- raise rorqual requirements to all level 5 related skills including panic and drone specs
---
- make rorqual unable to dock
---
- remove keepstars
---
If only people didn't focus entirely on killboard stats
---
Yep. Easy solutions are easy.
---
&gt; Random throwaway
---
k downvoted and closed the post
---
TBH, it's a really good thing when a MMORPG game developer tests systems like these and has the balls to take it away after they gather the feedback from the mob. It's hard enough to make such a risky move like this, it's even more risky to take it back after you implemented it in the wild. We should encourage more of these risks because to be honest, so many devs don't take huge risks like these in other games.
---
I say this wishing the blackout stayed, but this was such a huge disruption to a good portion of their game, I completely understand the need to take it back. Maybe in time, they will find a way to make the blackout like a storm that impacts some systems temporarily, but move on to other regions as time moves on. I think that would be a happy medium for all.
---
Ya that’s my point. We just don’t know. 
---
If people make plans for something they know is short term, they can accept future changes a little easier.
---
If you feel like CCP is constantly jerking you around in a game you pay for (directly or indirectly)  then it’s much easier to be frustrated and be done with it. 
---
It’s hArd to hook new players but it’s also hard to convince players that has enough with the bullshit to come back.
---
cause once dps mattered and not just alpha. This is as a result of the size of fleets being able to attain critical mass where things are able to be alphaed.
---
My idea is pretty simple, give cits traget able sub systems for one. Allowing you to knock out tethering, missiles booms and other offensive systems, maybe even knocking out fighter bays to lock out launch tubes. 
---
Then have them only repair able after the structure does, or by logi. 
---
Second would be restrict them to the sub planets and moons, and basiced on the size off the planet. Restrict the amount they can support, e.g 1 for moons  2 for small planet's.
---
4 for the gas giants 5 for the star. 
---
But each structure has takes up more room the the other.
---
Say a keep takes up 5 slots so can only be anchored on a star.
---
A tatara only takes up one and a astra 2. 
---
- numbers could be adjusted just the idea. -
---
Any thing anchored after the limit loses a timer.
---
So low power means no timer full means one.
---
Or at least that's what I would have done.
---
Means PLEX was rapidly on the rise long before supers and Rorqs so it would be in bad faith to solely attribute their inflation to just that.
---
There should be a place for both. I like the HAC doctrines for their speed and responsiveness. BSs just need a buff and a corresponding change to the structure damage cap (the best suggestion I've heard is to make it scale logarithmically).
---
So you are telling me that, people should have adapted instead of not logging in?  
---
Wormholes can be group activity. Much safer that way. So can the DEDs.  
---
Abyssals are affected by the number of people that runs them, more people run Abyssals, less ISK you earn. Unlike null-ratting.  
---
Incursions are already multi-pilot activity.  
---
Missions don't pay much and Burners can be adjusted easily.
---
That is absolutely not what blackout was only about. I mainly found it fun because for the first time in a long time I could scout or hunt or run into smaller gangs that for once didn't rely on N+1 to win. It added variation to fleets. It added another factor, a fog of war, where the speed and accuracy of scouts added variation to fleets fights. I could ambush. I could set traps for offensive entosisers. 
---
All of that is not possible in a world where we have programs like near2 lighting up if you even set foot in enemy territory or having the ability to perfectly know who is in system with you all the time. The access to perfect information makes everything bland. It makes fleet fights less about skill and organization.
---
They need to put a limit on the amount of Citadels, and make resources depletion effect everything... system sec status is increased by killing rats so Ratting is no longer a bottomless ISK faucet, ice and ore belts randomly respawn in the region once depleted, moons deplete after a handful of pulls and randomly respawn ANYWHERE in Nullsec etc...
---
I think that ticks all the boxes, slows down the wealth creation and forces people to move and risk more!
---
That looks nice. Put it up on contracts for me
---
I'm all for CCP being proactive, I'm not for the ambiguity in what it actually was. 
---
They said it was temporary, then some people said we're gonna make it permanent, etc. Noone actually knew. Now some people feel slighted when it never should have been a question that it ends and it's an experiment.
---
I would go for the "you don't appear in local till you break gate cloak" idea. Gate cloak exists because you may have people who take a long time to load on grid. So make it so that once you are fully loaded and can take action (or after 60s) that's when you appear.
---
That's kind of the point. For some people, the planning is just to give up on knowing anymore and quitting the game.
---
Cynos. Roll them back then bring back blackout.
---
Come to Rancer, we are waiting.
---
Why are you trying to mine in NULLSEC without any form of help from your BIG AMAZING ALLIANCE buddies? You do realize that this is a MMO right? Not farmville.   
---
Oh and, nobody cried like the nullbears from the start of the Eve, combined. You people are literally the salt mine of the game.
---
Nobody expected a single loki to kill a super? But instantly dropping your 'hard earned' \*cough\* *skill injectors and PLEX* \*cough\* super across multiple systems on a single sub cap is just straight up retarded. There is no balance on this other than whoever pays the most gets to have fun. By your logic, subcaps have no place in the game. Everyone should have supers and titans if they want to have fun.
---
Seems like it would be pretty easy to avoid this by limiting the rewards to less than the total worth of ship+fitting-insurance. I don’t mean ridiculous levels of payout for successful pvp, just more than now.
---
&gt;The bottom line was affected by the mass exodus of players and further Chaos changes are now undecided.
---
While the blackout wasn't great and arguably an attempt at hurting bots, 90% of players who quit seem to want high sec safety in null.
---
&gt;I suspect the cyno changes will eventually be rolled back.
---
The cyno changes are essential. One could argue there are too many ships able to use covert cyno.
---
&gt;I wish we could help support them in their attempts to revive a game that has been in steady decline for years.
---
Yeah, the community has never proposed a single good idea. Maybe do something about the fucking citadel spam? No? Okay.
---
thats what I mean .. biased towards the hunter, useless for the crab
---
\+1
---
But why would we come? This is the true question!
---
So mixed with info gathering done by player's it's over powered ?. 
---
Delay local and these. And still keep them. 
---
E.G give hunters a 1-2 minute timer after the break gate cloak to fund and tackle there target before local gives them away. Brings back cloak camping as a threat but also gives you some info on lingering people. 
---
Also 1-2 minute timer for them staying in local after leaving.
---
Oh boy.. no cyno on non-cyno ships.. FeelsGuttedMan
---
I'm not sure if your commitment to reposting this absolutely shit pic is admirable or pathetic.
---
I'mma go with pathetic.
---
Attackers can preform. That attacker only needs to form once. Defender is attacked dozens of times a day by multiple entities that only need to form once each. Attackers have the potential reward of killing capitals and supers. Defenders have the potential reward of killing a few dirt cheap bombers. Defenders form again, and again, and again, and again. And they never even get a fight out of it because why are bombers going to stick around to get the shit kicked out of them. It's constant disappointment. And it's not like you can go and attack Bomber's Bar in retaliation or anything. People get sick of it and they're like nah fuck ya it's not my problem anymore. I'm staying docked. Or I'm going to go shoot at someone else's Rorqs. Dropping supers is literally the only practical way to respond to everything and even then bombers can still kill enough to even the scoreboard if they happen to lose the whole fleet somehow. People are not obligated to be another's virtual punching bag. Null sec does not exist to be one's personal game reserve but people seem to think it's their God given right to be hand fed easy killmails.
---
Thank you for this, hope WHs will get some devs love.
---
No no no no no.  You are doing it ALL WRONG.
---
Everyone knows that to get what you want from Eve and CCP you have to come to /r/eve and REEEEEE like your fucking life depends on it.   You must be new here.
---
Literally gotten into debates with people here about how fucking STUPID that is.  Got it rubbed back in my face when it WORKED.  So yeah, lol.  Git gud nub.
---
Oh how I wish I could just insult you cancerous people to quit the game lmao. 2 months is still short term when you are talking about entering the third decade and stuff. The only reason it seemed like it wasn't working was because nullbears were too pussy even give it a try and instantly logged off never to log in again. They straight up left never to return. Did not even tried to adapt, did not even tried different things. It is like all they want to do is rat, like it is even fun.
---
As buffer increases the proportional value of your ship on average also increases. This means that gankers can use more expensive higher damage output ships to gank you.
---
Yes of course. Amazing math right there. Oh no, we lost 2k alts in a week, by these calculations, Eve won't have any players left and PCU will reach 0 the next month. Right.
---
&gt; All that CCP needed to was to make the game more appealing to new players.
---
How was Blackout appealing to new players?
---
God i hope so. I'd come back.
---
There are ticks to getting a real deep safe. I just open dscan choose two points 30au apart with nothing inbetween. Then  hit ctrl+b to make a bookmark mid warp at least 14.7 au away from any thing. 
---
This means you no longer appear on any ones d scans.
---
&gt;If they do decide to make further changes please please work with them not against them
---
We want to but the change has to be gradual and not biased towards any one playstyle. Removing local altogether was an extreme change, heavily biased towards one style of play: Hunting. Now before people fly off the handle and call me dumb krab; I am not. I dont rat, I dont mine, all I do is hunt either in hostile space or hunt cloaky shit in my space. It became super easy.
---
&gt;We all agree aspects are broken
---
Indeed there are broken aspects. But again removing regular cyno from all but 9 ships in the game(4 of which are extremely unrealistic to be used as cyno ships, except in rare situations) is another extreme change and it will not fix any broken aspect of the game. To potentially risk a 500mil ship with mediocre tank, everytime I want bridge something/move capitals, is not fun and not everyone is capable of risking that.
---
PLEX was on the rise, but rate of inflation kept increasing due to rorqs and super ratting and bots running rampart. In just a year we went from 3m to 4.6m per PLEX. Now do the calculation and tell me that inflation rate is good?
---
Well it does does effect the response fleets. You can't just light an wait, and people are slow so if the enemy nukes the cyno as fast as the can you can end up with only half or worse jumping.
---
It doesn't nerf the response because the changes just because people are slow and down dumb.
---
So here is the thing, you re-subbed because of the blackout, and for every person like you there were 40 who unsubbed because of the blackout.
---
Mining anom respawns at the same rate as asteroids, which is every 2-3 days. Solves the problem. Change my mind.
---
flair checks out
---
"For us to put them in a position where they can't try to fix the game in it's current state is upsetting."
---
screw that.  everybody wants them to fix the game.  they instead have decided to either troll the playerbase or use shock value changes.  
---
Two easy fixes that everybody* can agree on:
---
FIX THE INFINITE RESOURCE ISSUE
---
FIX CITADEL SPAM
---
AND then maybe we'd trust them a bit to do the right thing.
---
Yah I know there's a couple of people who run T3, big enyo's and all that. But they're no where near the numbers they used to be and when a lot of WH Isk is based on Sleeper salvage, that hurts.
---
I understand the feeling about that, but in reality EVE has a fuckton of unique resources. It's just that there's barely any cross pollination of them so it feels like there's only the local resource(moon goo, t3 salvage etc) and asteroid minerals. Go break down a T2 ship to its base materials, you'll see there's tons of different unique materials, but they're almost all moon goo typed. If these were cross pollinated around a lot more it'd feel more diverse.
---
I'm also a strong believer that Trig space should have been an addition to wormhole space, not it's own thing. Trig ships needing Sleeper salvage along with the new materials would have been a great boost to W space PvE.
---
Also mini rant, I'm super annoyed that Trigs have a full lineup including advanced versions of ships while T3's are still stuck at cruisers and destroyers only.
---
It didn't affect new players. What I meant , It was one side of the change. It was making all the farmville players leave. And CCP only needed to do other side of the change to pull new blood. Make the game more appealing to new players.
---
No strategy as a company. They have a Corporate Governance Problem. The board of directors seems to be all executives / making it an operational board and not a supervisory-strategic one. This affects the direction and decision-making process.
---
You can't say it never was, it is.
---
Alliances wouldn't be disbanded ratting income would be delayed till you put one up.
---
Screw cynos. Make them schlep through gates.
---
The Arazu is a subcap ;)
---
The problems that are killing the game right now are all 3-4 years old now. CCP received vast quantities of feedback about these changes at the time and didn't listen. Today it's just too little too late because the playerbase who'd have appreciated these fixes aren't the majority anymore.
---
What has been making them leave is... almost every single change they have made.  Fozziesov reduced resource wars, rorquals+injectors made everyone just want to krab, jump fatigue made umbrellas super potent, citadels made space super safe, moon mining changes reduced resource wars, skill injectors made every doctrine accessible to every alliance so all that matters is numbers...
---
And on...
---
I mean they have done some good little things.  And some of the big things on their own were good, like fatigue (in its current form) and fozziesov is a noble idea.  But really, they have not made a single major change in 4+ years that hasn't moved us inexorably closer to death, instilled a mindset of entitlement and safety in players, and so pushed the game into an endgame state that there is no economic achievement left to brag about.  It has to be hard to unfuck their game at this point, when EVE 2013 had its issues but was so far and away a healthier, better game.
---
No no, I’m apologise you are right they weren’t losing players and money they are turning local back on because they kneel to the null leaders, I’m also assuming you a Lee a flat earth believer and think vaccinations are bad 🤣
---
I'm legitimately confused by this.
---
Can people stop advocating for stuff removal randomly ?
---
Remove excavator, put mining power of rorquals into random cycle lasers that don't repeat, end of story.
---
Or rework ore anomalies to have a lot of small rocks and put laser on rorqs, forcing people to change target with their laser every so often that it cannot be easily multiboxed.
---
&gt;Instead CCP should push more for solo/small gang content.
---
Exactly right. There has been a war on solo and small gang for a long time. Look at minnie/amarr FW space, you have maybe 4-5 systems that are active and occupied by blobs and that's it.
---
&gt;Sure, people will say adapt or die. People adapt when they leave Eve and play other games and at current situation, eve can't afford this.
---
Those people are retarded. Notice the salt when the blackout turned off the isk printer. These people want high sec safety and null sec income or they leave the game.
---
Blackout predictably tanked PvE in Null.  Full stop.  The risk/reward was totally wrong and people knew it.  The only places that undocked anything were in Delve and a couple of areas that were supported by big groups.
---
So I brought a domi back from HS to my WH with low sec status and the faction police just webbed me off the gate.  I think I'm around -3.  Does lower sec status  make them scram faster?
---
There was a 300 page feedback thread on injectors, but CCP largely ignored it. The CSM wasn't needed, and it's still useless.
---
I had a friend who mined 400 bil in the first two months of the rorq changes, rmt'd it all and got permabanned.  When I asked him why he did it, he said "these changes are going to kill the game anyway, I figured I might as well cash out."  I don't condone it but it hurts to think abiut how right he was....
---
They were losing alt accounts and farmville players. So yes, they were losing some profit. Not losing money. Who mentioned anything about null leaders though? Are you retarded?
---
Blackout was a one-note meme idea that players seized upon from sheer desperation and delusion.
---
Piracy as a trade is dying (or is currently dead) and here is why...
---
Because people were so used to the idea of ratting safely alone. Just dock up when near2 tells you that there are hostiles nearby. You are suppose to be able to defend yourself in your own sov, you know? Maybe have a few friends in a MMO? Oh I know, the horror of actually trying to socialize in a MMO game..
---
&gt; null sec is only safe due to the players policing it
---
my wife asked me what the laws were in the game because she is a lawyer. i tried to explain it to me, and she basically told me that eve doesn't have laws... it has police.
---
That part is true... and for major combat stuff CCP should come up with a way to shut local down... but Mr Cloaky Loki shooting Hulks still needs to show up in local when its not real Null Warfare going on...
---
Having more fun with games like DayZ and Tarkov and the likes these days. Yeah the stakes aren´t that high but the squeakers who play them have more drive and ambition on a personal level than 95% of Eve player base combined.
---
in black out anything with a cloak could camp a system, pick when they wanted to fight, call in more guys to help, all while the ratter has is none the wiser. sub cap anything was made suicidal and big whaler fleets like bombers bar or stukas decimated rorqs and almost always carriers. all those things you mentioned are player made, blackout is not player made tools that helped them survive, it’s a cloaked hunters easypass buff. before the cyno change a carrier pilot would have minutes to gather some guys to help him survive a drop, now that plus black out and the one minute self tackle meant almost sure destruction. it meant that if wanted a chance to fight back you needed a second account to yolo a half a bill ship that will die. is that fair? nothing could see you, your 80m to 150m ship could easily be replaced while the guy you’re trying to hit has no awareness of you, a self imposed tackle, shitty application that was nerfed and has to sub another account to maybe survive. sub cap don’t even have a chance. in eve if you make the fight favor you then fuck yea you’re doing it right, blackout is starting out a fight blindfolded, out numbered and overwhelmed. null requires player made strength, black out is simply an advantage that completely fucks industrialist, subcap ratters, and small alliances. yea i’m sure it sounds like a fair fight to guys without the blindfold lmao.
---
You're also selective in memory it seems because for the first 2 weeks or so almost everyone, even on this subreddit full of bittervets, was saying how they loved blackout and had so much more fun in eve with it than they've had for years. With such a reception it's no wonder it was considered a good move.
---
Cpu went from around 20k to 12/13k and losing some profit! Don’t you fucking realise they see the mass unsubscribes and know that the road they are on is unsustainable! Look at that prolick falcons face he’s gutted in the announcement but they had no choice! They run a business and if they don’t sell what the people want it’s not sustainable! Why is that such a difficult thing to understand?? And I’m retarded lol!
---
Always wondered, maybe a terrible idea, but what if regions/constellations/systems mineral resources and pirate populations could become depleted if the area's PvE content was over farmed. Something like predator and prey populations where if there are too many predators the prey population dips and the predators die out or move to new areas but once they are gone the prey population comes back to equilibrium with the environment. 
---
Pack 20k+ players into a single region, and over the course of a few months your combat and ore site spawns decrease to 10-20% of normal. Low enough that it can't sustain 20k+ players but still enough to support several smaller groups. As the large blocs leave and smaller ones move in the resources would slowly replenish over time to equilibrium. It would force large blocs to move to new regions regularly and likely fight each other for the most plentiful, while smaller groups would fight each other to take over the regions left behind or defending themselves against invading large blocs making they have to form temporary coalitions. Would probably also deter that out of control spamming of structures if they needed to be moved on a regular basis in the new nomadic organizations.
---
Why are you entitled to safety in null security space?
---
&gt;Blackout hit their pockets hard it seems so they are doing something. Speak with you wallet/purse if you want to change shit with them.
---
Notice how this can only happen when the players are resonably unified on an issue. As long as you have idiots who personally benefit from something, this will not happen. That's why it didnt happen with injectors. There were even total dumbfucks who thought it was the same as the bazaar.
---
There is a really obvious solution: mine in something tougher than a fucking hulk lmao
---
Stop listening to Reddit.
---
Lol, making pve safer is the opposite of what needs to happen. Making isk in Eve should be way harder, the root of the entire issue.
---
All you have to do is swipe that VISA and you will reach the endgame in just a second. Just buy some skill injectors and some supers/titans and voila. You are now respected member of this community. Oh, and be sure to boson some t1 frigates to earn the right call yourself a vet.
---
Probably true as the obvious ways to combat bots are simply beyond them.
---
trololol because we don't need those silly PVE carebears (aka prey) and their dollars right, let's just go black it out and kick 'em out...one month later...next opinion pls
---
&gt; would have probably lead to less whining.
---
Unlikely. This is eve. Whining about any given change is SOP.
---
He can allign all he wants. If i see a barge alligned out ill just bump him first while decloaking.
---
This
---
That's quite a bit of projecting. What you have in this case is a bunch of babies who want high sec safety with null sec income.
---
adaPT OR DIE LOL
---
It depends on your available free time and personal determination.  The more determination you have the less free time is required.
---
I dont know friend, every article i've read and every video i've watched before starting to play the game suggested that it was a time consuming cruel world that didn't care about you and your real life. If that game turned into a smartphone mmo you fire up to pass 30 mins before you pick up your kids from school, its really sad for me
---
ADAPT OR DIE. LOL
---
Exodus of botters, you mean.
---
How is it wrong?
---
You are retarded because you mention something out of the blue. No one said anything about null leaders bro. Also, are you suggesting that Eve would have died if it stayed in 12k PCU? No. Blackout would have made the game healthier in the long run. 2 months is nothing when the game was here for more than 16 years. They could endure it but PA just wants to milk the cash cow till it dies, whenever it dies. They don't care about long term health of the game. CCP wouldn't gone bankrupt just because they lost 6k PCU.
---
So you want a totally broken game where 90% of isk making actitives are totally obsolete in terms of plex? Good balance. Notice the plex price coming down siginficantly when bots and isk printers mostly left.
---
&gt; so you weren't visible for some variable of minutes
---
That's mostly what I've been pushing for. A truly delayed local where neither residents or newly entered pilot would see each other for a few minutes (unless the someone said something in local). the delay blindness needs to go both directions.
---
You do know that Delve stands as an example of folks doing exactly that, yes? Why do people keep saying this like it's supposed to be this novel idea?
---
Alpha doctrines have existed for a decade.
---
Some people have no interest in PVP. NONE! Yet PVPers fail or refuse to understand that. Or accept that! Yet they always seem to be the most vocal people bitching about this or that. Especially some aspect of PVE. 
---
That's why they are always screaming for some nerf or other or some "rebalance" or other. I suspect that's also the REAL reason for the hatred of bots and botters despite the reasons that are publically claimed. "Oh it's unfair" or "Oh it's inflationary" or AFK is "wrong". Yadda. Yadda. 
---
BULLSHIT!
---
I think most PVP lovers are obsessed, consciously or unconsciously with tears. You get no tears from bots and botters. On the other hand it's easy to get tears (and QUITTING THE GAME) from noobs! That's why some pathetic asshat people seem to specialize in shooting noobs who have no idea what's going on! But who are guaranteed sources of tears
---
On the other hand you tend to get no tears from people, especially vets, who are smart enough (or rich enough) to not give a shit if a pixelship dies AND who are smart enough not to spend even more "just pixel money" than makes sense to on a pixelship.
---
Please please work with them. CSM?
---
CCP appears to like the "blob" because it creates "community" and turns the game into a glorified chat players use to hang out with their friends.
---
Listen CCP, can you just add something new to your game?
---
as sarcastic as this sounds it's not entirely false

&gt;People feel so bad for Falcon. He's the one that made the changes that killed EVE. The blackout and cyno changes were nothing compared to what they could've done not just in the last month but in the last 3 years.
---
CCP Falcon is a community manager.
---
“Working” aka tanking the game and making people unsubscribe wholesale.  PCU looked as if it fell off a cliff and I expect that CCP internal numbers were even worse.  
---
While the changes themselves sure started this, the absolutely awful job from CCP in messaging what they were trying to do, and give people some idea of the vision they were going for was the real problem.  All they did was make 70% of NS feel that CCP really did not have a clue where the hell they were taking things and that the player was just along for the ride.  
---
The only advice from CCP was basically HTFU.  Well, there was another option...fricking leave.  
---
Hopefully they will understand that a dialogue and clear messaging is not a bad thing.
---
I need more storage for all this toxic salt.  
---
2 months is short when talking about a lot of stuff, in eve 2 months can be a long time and see many changes sov can change hand, alliances can die and so much more. 
---
week by week drop off isn't instantly logging off. do we know for sure these players aren't coming back no only you wish that. 
---
like with a lot of things some players did try others did and figured the current state wasn't for them. 
---
once again showing your toxic  attitude just cos you don't find something fun merans it isn't fun for others. 
---
So closed minded in a sdandbox game.
---
&gt; I saw it in my mind but the lion king thing is way more eloquent. Thanks dude
---
Yeah people need to think like responsible lions, not hyenas that just simply attack and not look for sustainability. We need the carebears for not only prey targets but their dollars. There will always be hunters, but the moment you kill and go unsustainable on prey, it takes a long time to build that up.

Nerf citadels 
---
1 keepstar per region, 1 fort per constellation, 1 astra per system. Owners wont let you use it? Guess you're off to war little buddy. 
---
Boom no more citi spam and the cap umbrella just got its nuts cut off lol
---
so you’re asking for motivation to do something in game? eves a sandbox, if you want to do something then you have to want it, you have to do it. if it’s not worth it to push in someone’s space and make it you’re own then why bother doing it. it takes effort to hold space, you better be prepared to apply more effort then the guy holding the space to take it. it’s really as simple as that
---
So pvp bad krab good?
---
Probably would have survived with 12k are you suggesting that losses would have stopped there because the trend was down! When would you have suggested they stop? 11k 9k 5k at what point is the point of no return? Ccp obviously know much more than you and knew the point of no return was NOW! And they decided that because they have information you don’t!
---
Falcon, drink... Nooo. 😜
---
very, but there is ppenty of help available ;)
---
Battleships and battlecruisers are too easily tracked by cap blobs, so any null alliance bringing battleships is going to get demolished by fighters and HAW weaponry, not to mention still being slow and vulnerable to bombs. Muninns are valuable now because of their speed, ADC, and sig slotting them into a role that can stand up to cap blobs to a certain point.
---
TLDR it's the cap meta that killed BS and BC fleets.
---
No, but after -5 you're freely engageable by players. And in such case Perimter is one of the few systems you should avoid, since the usual wardeccers camp it all the time for targets of opportunity. And well, if a player can hold you till the police locks you, you're screwed. (Unless you burn back to gate, BEFORE the police shows up)
---
definitely not to this extent. But that could also be a cost factor as sleipnirs and machariels were not common back then
---
it isn't.
---
it's a boosting ship some dipshit gave a mining drone bonus to.
---
quick test for you - does it get a bonus from any of the mining skills. oops, no it doesn't!
---
Why are you entitled to impunity (in MY house)?
---
Did they give numbers on the impact?
---
Thanks seagull!
---
I'm going to be honest, I didn't understand a single word.⊙﹏⊙
---
That shit makes zero sense. In your post the cloaks are the "problem", not the blackout.
---
now the loki has no chance to catch you at all.  Shows up in local you warp out. 
---
Its so onesided. 
---
They need to leave blackout in and implement a null warning system in the form of a structure that whilst fueled and not reinforced or in low power automatically reveals players in local to you if they get within X au.  The range is dependant on the ADM of the system. 
---
Then on top o this they can implement a true scount with a reduction to the range of detection etc.
---
The crab should have a standing fleet to support them. There's no balancing this if your goal is for the crab to be able to warp off - then no amount of local delay would be acceptable to you.
---
i think nullsec is basically mega city one and the players are all judge dredd (empowered to summarily arrest, convict, sentence, and execute)
---
Just remember who used them before muninns were cool
---
I can only play 2-4 hours a day,if I'm lucky that is.
---
Save us Suitonia. You're our only hope.
---
No, it did not increase the value of ISK in general, only with regards to PLEX, because PLEX is tied to ISK/hr. However, Blackout makes every resource gathered more valuable. The value of ISK is actually decreasing, because resources like minerals become more expensive, as well as anything that is built with player gathered resources. E.g. Morphite almost doubled in price because of Blackout.
---
Effectively, every ship becomes more valuable, increasing risk aversity.
---
That is arrant nonsense
---
I am a 2004 vet. I do buy plex time-to-time, but only because piracy as my trade is pretty much dead. Low-sec as a space has become hard to earn income off with the exception of the DED sites we have that can drop good loot.
---
Hilmar wanted the game to be hard and dangerous, as it was intended from the very start.
---
Sadly there are way too many pubbies that can´t handle a little danger nowadays, ruining ANY option for change because they will unsub their 20+ risk averse alts immediately.
---
Here you are:

That was what they said in the initial dev blog about it. And there has been a couple of posts on the forums and reddit saying similar which I have neither the time to look for again, nor the desire to...
---
Nado/naga fleet, drone assisted sentry ishtars, maels, tempests, and arty abaddons
---
Cynos are the problem. Everyone stopped doing anything because nobody had any clue what they were actually going to fight. Oh look, a solo cruiser... WRONG - it's a titan, 4 dreads, 2 carriers and 10 BLOPS. How is that even remotely considered a valid and/or constructive game mechanic?
---
Make cynos a citadel/structure module and force people to build and defend bridgeheads.
---
Among most middleground ideas this is not a good one. It's at the weaker side.
---
The ADC is far too powerful as is. Perhaps it needs a massive drawback such as increasing ship mass (or similar, to stop instabt rolling holes) essentially making the ship drop so much speed that it cannot anchor. Alternatively buff the resists slightly then make the ADC shut off all other active modules, guns, mwds, invuln fields etc for the entire duration of the ADC.
---
They do have a role on assault frigs but currently they're forcing every nullsec blob to use them because HACs have somehow achieved all three of the damage, speed, hp triangle while also being extremely affordable.
---
That's a lot more than most people i've met who say they have limited time to play. It'll be rough getting started but once you are into it that's plenty of time.
---
I am a null line member I was on the receiving end unfortunately I like the idea of change just want more of a balanced approach that actually can drive conflict not shooting fish in a barrel which is what blackout was
---
Ok, thanks. I just couldn't figure out if it was pro or anti pirate even though I know kink IS pro pirate. Lol.
---
Wow, cool idea. But I think to make everything harder, only allow supply fuels for another citadels from the chosen citadel. At certain time everyday (set by owner), npc supply ships will undock from the main citadel and supply fuels for another. Those ships can be killed (even though they drop no loots). If citadels require supply through npc don’t receive supply for 3 days, it will self-destruct. Also limit the amount of npc supply ships, so if one corp setup too many citadels, those ships will need extra time to return and take fuels to resupply another citadels.
---
NEED to do that? For the fun and challenge of it, maybe? Just maybe? I sure as hell don't NEED to shoot players, but I sure like to.
---
If you remove the sp I injected the past two years, I won’t even bother playing then.
---
MuninnBTW
---
shield blaster legion then
---
Totally broken for you bro, many 1000s enjoy the game, who said bots left, the general consensus is they didn’t that didn’t leave they moved to less profitable Notting in low and high sec, 
---
Nothing is worth a lot of money, banning of bots doesn’t mean they are gone they create new accounts and continue,
---
The classic "it was only bots leaving"
---
Do you really think the bots are the ones that quit? They rely on this shot for their income. The bots stayed and just did something else in highsec.
---
My problem with blackout was that it was all stick and no carrot. 
---
It's was a low dev time solution to the problem. I hope they iterate on blackout with something like not showing in local until you break gate cloak or maybe something like combat inties being "resistant" to local in some way.
---
Ah.  Forgot about that part.  Ty
---
This is not the North Pole.
---
EVE devs are a love fest of technology and psychology.
---
Blackout going away. Cyno changes are not.
---
I already don’t feel like logging in but regulate me to just one character at a time? I won’t even bother then
---
There hole point was to be tough. Boost rep and mine. 
---
Though if you ask me that should off been be reduced to. 
---
Be tough, boost
---
Then assist with reps and mining a part off a fleet not the fleet.
---
People didn't spam POS because you had to keep them fueled. POS fuel was tiered in ~100/200/400 million ISK in fuel per month, which was a lot more back then than it is now.
---
The moment they went unfueled, you could say good bye to your POS mods within a few hours. They also lost their "tether" when unfueled. That's why you made damn sure you had one or two POS permanently fueled, instead of having half a dozen flying around.
---
You don't want ratters getting free intel, but have no problems giving that same free intel to hunters.
---
&gt; For the fun and challenge of it, maybe?
---
except it isn't all that interesting, since i have no reason to do it. it just feels like an immeasurable waste of time.
---
if i had a reason to do it, it might actually feel like a worth while endevour.
---
I do agree it's at the weak side, but at the same time it's the easiest to stomach for all parties involved while hurting the bots the most (at least in their current iteration).
---
This.
---
I also drank alot of german beer.
---
You think most isk making activites should be obsolete?
---
&gt;banning of bots doesn’t mean they are gone they create new accounts and continue,
---
So you advocate not banning because they will adapt. Great strategy.
---
See shitty picture telling me to press thumbs down, I immediately press closest thumbs down. Am I doing it right?

i mean, u can name all the random doctrines you want. Doesn't mean they were used regularly or any good.
---

---
Quick test for you, ever heard of the Industrial Core ? You know, one of the ship bonus being "Can fit Industrial Core modules". Yes, the same industrial core that gives Mining bonuses. Guess what, it is a mining skill !
---
Damn useless rhetoric, it IS a mining ship, regardless of you wishing it to be or not be one. It wasn't before, it is now.
---
"Some dipshit", like you called them, are Eve developer, so they pretty much made it a mining ship.
---
&gt; Alternatively **buff the resists slightly** then make the ADC shut off all other active modules, guns, mwds, **invuln fields** etc for the entire duration of the ADC.
---
Uhm...
---
Because if you can't defend your space you shouldn't be living there, and if the only reason you can defend your space is due to having perfect intelligence with little more effort than a script that is a weak excuse.
---
CCP is trying to sabotage the game so we all move to their mobile platform.
---
Heres a great idea, why dont we leave local alone and hunters go back to actual having to use their brains to snag shit
---
Scaling sov upkeep cost based on the number of structures in a system.  Exponential scaling not linear and  all structures, not just yours.  Tie a portion of that cost into an onlineing fee to help prevent that from being easily weaponized. 
---
Even a massive alliance will twitch when adding another structure make the sov bill go up by a few dozen billion a month.  
---
If we want to shoot to limiting it to planets and moons, maybe exempt one structure anchored at each moon, then you can approximately keep it cost efficient to at pos spam limits.
---
I think that is the only real way to do it.
---
&gt;Mining bonuses
---
drone bonuses - and that's not a skill.
---
Doesn't want folks to advocate for random stuff removal, advocates for random stuff removal.

This is the longest most drawn out way of typing "ignore me Im a retard" I've seen in a while. Stop posting

Suck hilmars dick long enough. You too would lose your soul.
---
Where did I say isk making activities should be obsolete? 
---
And no I don’t advocate that at all! Again where did I say that? Are you just attempting to put words in my mouth or lead the discussion because you are doing a piss poor job!
---
Tell ya what give it a month and see how the pcu reacts to local coming back on! But even then I’m sure you will have some other far flung reason for people logging back into the game
---
It'd be a good change though. It's asinine that you appear in local while you're still in a warp tunnel for several seconds.
---
Is it as bad as your neck?
---
&gt; How many hours do you get max to respond to a citadel bash before it is destroyed again?
---
I would tell you, but my athanor is under attack right now. I'll reply in 2 weeks when I get back from defending.
---
I'm erring towards admiration on this one
---
Depends on your goals. Imho you can play the game even if you only have very little time. One good aspect is that your skills continue to train even if you don't play. So, if you only play two hours every week you have some nice new skills everytime you play :) Obviously you will have trouble to do certain things if you want to play the game this way though.
---
well structures cost is, you dont like spam, reinforce alot of them. ya gotta hate that jita spam too
---
No one left due to blackout.
---
Delete gnosis
---
It means that all you really need is real life money. Then time is not a problem. What remains is learning the game mechanics and such, which you can do even when you are not even playing. Just head to evewiki and start reading.
---
You don't live in null. Your opinion doesn't matter. Bye.
---
I'd play it.
---
&gt; like you there were 40 who unsubbed because of the blackout.
---
1 person and 39 alts doesn't count. Which is what the game will be left with if CCP listen to those with a safe space mentality.
---
All you really need to us is get rid of time zone tanking, change the reinforcement timers to 2 from 3, get rid of damage caps.  Do this, and change the current SOV mechanics to not be totally awful and the structure spam will go away very fast.  
---
NS is not LS.  It’s not a healthy place without big wars.  It needs that level of destruction to balance things out.
---
Sometimes you have to remember this is just a game and not real life. I know it’s hard to swallow but eve is just pixels.
---
You need the krab to either feel safe or have the activity be worth it for them to be in a ship out in space making isk. If it's too risky/not worth it which during blackout it was what is the point of being in space.
---
Seriously, if a dread cant lock and track a low sig frig, then what good is it? We should make another set of guns with 0.89x capital gun damage but enough tracking to hit literally anything. That will help the broken caps
---
Randomly removed logic
---
How could you actually think someone was suggesting a wreck be worth more than the ship was before it was destroyed?
---
How could people upvote you?
---
The fuck.
---
'Ohhh a bug in a game??? i better make a meme of it and post it on the internet!! instead opening a support ticket'
---
Ah the old CCP insert 500 more Plex scheme.
---
I am fully aware that you may not enjoy PVP.
---
But perhaps this game isn't the right one for you. No, I am not telling you to leave. But I am telling you to evaluate what this game has been about from it's inception. It has been about human conflict with very limited restrictions on what you are allowed to do. In fact, it is highly encouraged by developers and players alike that the second you leave the safe confines of a station, you will be vulnerable.
---
In the past few years, CCP has consistently catered to a group of players that didn't share this mentality, leading to a never ending debate about PVP and PVE. We can not have both, as without PVPers there would not be an incentive to be a PVE-er most of the time, and without PVE there isn't enough materials to sate PVP-players.
---
Normally, this balance would be stable. It would mean that there's plenty of content to go around with rewards worth your time. But with all the changes in the last five years, CCP made it so that the rewards stack up without an equivalent raise in the difficulty or risk involved. This is what I am personally upset about.
---
I believe strongly that, if you move down to harder space, that your access to information and content should be more and more generated by active engagement of players, both PVE and PVP. It makes zero sense from a balance perspective that a space with zero security measures has unlimited, unrestricted intel through local and other tools. Yet it is here.
---
So what I would like to see, as a PVP player, is an environment where running PVE content is valuable, a little more scarce and a lot more risky. As such, it requires players to be a team to be safe and sound. This is what Blackout forced, if we ignore the bleeding effect. Our organisation lost many players for awhile but those who stayed actually became more closely connected to our entire player base. While they strongly prefer PVE, they also do PVP if it is needed to defend their home and make the money they want to make.
---
I see that in the following way:
---
* **Enemies will not show up in local as long as they hold gate-cloak.**This forces people to be somewhat proactive if there are people around, or risk getting caught if they don't pay attention. It also fixes a fundamental problem for PVP in these areas. Up until Blackout, it was possible to see an enemy player enter local before their ship left the old system. This was done to ensure that the system transfer works smoothly, but it often gave 5-10 seconds of a warning before anything could be done.
---
* We need local to be based around mechanisms that can be interrupted and harassed. It forces content and it also requires players to defend their space in null security space.
---
I do however want to address one fundamental flaw that you make in your reasoning:
---
\&gt; That's why they are always screaming for some nerf or other or some  "rebalance" or other. I suspect that's also the REAL reason for the  hatred of bots and botters despite the reasons that are publically  claimed. "Oh it's unfair" or "Oh it's inflationary" or AFK is "wrong".  Yadda. Yadda.
---
I disagree. We do not hate bots because they are bots. A bot can be caught, can be killed and can be stopped with unconventional techniques. But we hate bots because they often are abused with other tools to report intel to special channels or to alert their owners that they are at risk elsewhere. They destabilize the economy and make the value of sites lower for you as a PVE-player, because they don't have the problem of taking breaks or having to leave.
---
Bots are an economy breaking problem that needs addressing, and by removing bots you do remove targets for PVPers but it also means that PVE players have more wealth to use to hopefully partake in content with us.
---
Another note: A lot of the solutions to structure spam look great if it was that was from the start.  We've already blown past that, and we need to deal with what exists and encourage that to change.  Limit it to only new structures and Delve is still Delve.  Force it and you take agency away from players.  Make it not worth doing, and logistics will eventually take care of itself while giving players "choices".
---
Alliances can die in a single day. What you are saying doesn't make sense. 2 months is too short for game that exists for 16 years and talking about getting into the third decade.   
---
If those players are not coming back, then why go back on blackout. Just keep it? Again, what you are saying does not make sense.   
---
Are you having a stroke?  
---
Eve is largely known for having deadly boring PvE mechanics. It is only fun for those dead inside and have no motor skills left. Mainly the people who think watching Netflix is actually part of the gameplay.
---
You tell them Bruce Kemp
---
Wow it only took 23 batphones for frat to finally kill something. So hot right now.
---
Maels were the common alpha ship.
---
&gt; It didn't affect new players.
---
Before blackout, ramping up ISK income in null as a new player was relatively easy. Salvage wrecks from others until you can afford a Vexor and later upgrade to a VNI, then start working on aquiring doctrine ships. Not much room for error, you can't afford to lose a VNI as a new player. Blackout invalidated subcap ratting and broke that chain. With Blackout, null is not a region anymore where new players can actually live in. For them, it's back to high, farming ISK in isolated instances, with all the boredom that entails.
---
With Blackout, CCP ignored every lesson they learned with Brave., Karmafleet and Horde.
---
This might just create an even greater imbalance between small and large alliances, or even make small alliances/corps completely impossible in null.
---
I did not play eve for some time, so my info might be a little outdated:
---
As I know eve, both small and large alliances can create a perfectly safe krabbing enviroment. Its easier for the large alliance, and the small group might have to stop their activities more often if there is danger around, but both can be perfectly save.
---
Basically the disadavantage is only more down time, so both can earn good ISK/hour. But if you factor the large losses into the ROI, suddenly a change in the risk will mean a gigantic shift in the effective ISK/hour, making it impossible to balance.
---
Example (my numbers might be outdated too):  
---
Assuming a 2bil carrier, ratting for 200 mil/hour in the current system.
---
Lets try to balance this for a 20% chance of loss per hour: 20% of 2 bil is 400 mil, so we have to increase the reward to 600 mil to get the same ISK/hour. But these 20% cannot be constant for everyone. If we assume a large alliance with great intel and supercap umbrella, they probably still can reduce that risk to 10%. While on the other hand a quite small alliance might be more at about 30%.
---
So now we have large alliance:
---
600 mil/ hour - 10% \* 2 bil / hour = 400 mil / hour
---
And small alliance:
---
600 mil /hour - 30%  \* 2 bil / hour = 0 ISK / hour.
---
The large alliance doubled its income, while the small one has no income at all.
---
One could try to change the numbers and try to balance for different loss rates, but that wont change the problem: It can only be balanced if the loss/hour is small compared to the income/hour, (either low risk as it is currently, or low cost), otherwise a shift in the risk will always lead to a large imabalance, forcing extreme risk minimization on everyone.
---
Increasing mass doesn't drop speed at all.
---
All the people in this thread are weird. Most are just botter vets that are stuck in their ways, don't listen tk them.
---
The game has a steep learning curve, yes, although once you find the niche you love to do, most playstyles can be done casually and easy going or hardcore turbo min/max. Although the more you put in, the more you get out of it.
---
I'd highly recommend giving it a try, and there's the alpha clone model exactly for that reason. You can try the game and see if you like it before investing into a monthly subscription.
---
The reasons and means to initiate a fight are watered down. Just wanting to burn the world down at random is the most nerfed play style over the past decade.
---
Hah. And people thought blackout and wow classic hurt thr pcu! This would be like a trainwreck you can't look away from.
---
I think CCP finally gave those people who always wanted to take a break from the game a reason.  I'm afraid this yo-yo ride will have a negative effect overall.  If they had left Blackout as a gimmic for two weeks to get people back to feel that taste of Eve, I think it would have been overall more successful.
---
PLEX is literally the only thing that matters. High PLEX cost means you have inflation. Because ships, ammos and everything else that players build are made from minerals. And minerals have infinite supplies. That is why things will always get cheaper as long as there are people who mine more than who destroy. But PLEX does not work like that. Players have to buy PLEX with real cash. In a healthy game, PLEX would have very low inflation rate.
---
The unfortunate truth is the carebears pay CCPs bills and they always have.  Eve is a much better game with true risk and danger, but risk hurts the carebear isk income, and CCP cant survive without them.
---
I play 2-4 hours like twice aweek if I'm lucky.
---
I consider myself extremely short on time. I play maybe 2 hours a day, four days a week. That’s down from a maximum of 4 hours a day during the week and 12+ hours a day on the weekends (married with children now). There are times when I haven’t been able to log in for long periods of time, but I never quit.
---
The thing that makes Eve great is that as long as you stay subscribed with skills in your queue, your characters will improve. The only reason I’ve never quit Eve is because of this feature. 
---
Eve isn’t particularly hard to get into. It’s hard to get good at. It punishes you for rushing into things.
---
PvP? Can't you read, he only wants to farm.
---
Someones ability to own Sov probably doesnt come from having local chat.
---
Mr. Hulk getting a 5 second window to escape certain death I don't think constitute... "can't defend your space"... I agree NEAR2 is bullshit and should be banned...
---
You want to restart the isk printer.
---
&gt;Tell ya what give it a month and see how the pcu reacts to local coming back on!
---
Yeah, lets give them that free intel and high sec safety so they can print isk. Of course some will come back.
---
It's actually because the game makers have no clue what is going on. Why would a player do activity x if a week from now CCP just changes things for lulz.
---
He was logged out on the keepstar.
---
There were plenty alpha doctrines back in the day. 1400 Maelstroms/Abaddons were really popular for years. Same for hurricanes.
---
Let's not forget that a certain fleet size could always be considered "alphaing", you were never able to outrep 200 apocs/rokhs or sniper hacs. Just like now, except 200 Muninns alpha a lot more shit.
---
He had a bunch of other clients logging in.

right, that was kind of her point. either that or it's lawless like the wild west.
---
How hard did you get bullied in high school?
---
The people who see eve as a PVP based game with a PVE support are outnumbered by the people who see EVE as a PVE game with optional PVP.

Link structures to celestials.  Easy fix . Sun, moon, planets gates

Doesn't want random stuff removal, but compensated removal is fine.
---
All of these were regularly used. Wtf are you on about?
---
delete  all capital ships
---
Nope I want null to be exactly what ccp said it would be, a place that players could build and play the way they want! And guess what they will, and we will hear rrreeee from the minority but fuck em! Ya know what, anyone that doesn’t like local should quit, see what that does to the pcu, but we both know the answer to that, don’t we!
---
you must not be on the eve facebook...
---
It was isolated instances in null anyway. Without blackout, you did not need to team up with other players. Only when shit hit the fan. It was a single player experience in a MMO which boasts about having every player in the same shard. See the irony? Nobody does null ratting because it is fun. They do it because it was safe and it gave better reward than any other place. And salvaging wrecks after a super ratting would get you a VNI or a Myrmidon in a day or two. So, a big no.
---
Hey Exo, are you guys recruiting? What about newish players with stuff to learn
---
It does if you are using an AB/MWD.
---
This looks good
---
Ok bud
---
Ratters have plenty opportunity to see what's moving through their space long before a scout jumps into the final krabbing system. I don't think some information assymetry is inherently unfair.
---
But if you think that, what do you consider the pre-blackout situation where ratters can act while the hunter is still loading?
---
I miss Drakes o.0 \0/

That's wrong on so many levels. Mineral supply is not infinite, it's based on the amount of mining that is done. If less mining is done, supply will go down. And then there are more ships built than there are destroyed. Especially capitals.
---
&gt; But PLEX does not work like that. Players have to buy PLEX with real cash. In a healthy game, PLEX would have very low inflation rate.
---
In a healthy game, players wouldn't have to buy a MTX currency to skip grind in the first place.
---
Yeah. Now watch all the credit card warriors downvote me because their existence is an insult itself.
---
&gt; Maybe its time for the few of us left to follow our brothers in afk hybernation dunno really.

Bye 👋

&gt; This community is full of weak and softcore players

Lmao

There are lots of other things to try and change.  Your post makes it sound like one change and a roll back and now CCP is unsure about everything.  HTFU CCP guys!  Try, try again.  Just because Chaos was a misfire doesn't mean other things wont help the game.  Keep trying and keep listening to the feedback.  Some things fail, some won't fail.  How about fixing structures and system wide cyno jammers.  That'll make it easier for null sec to shoot each other.  Then resources --- a month ago a poster on reddit stated something like:  It makes no sense when you rat in a system and it spawns MORE anomalies.  It should be the direct opposite.  That will make nullsec spread out to seek more anomalies to run and that would be a great change to try.
---
And /u/grathtelkin did it 5+ years ago
---
Yep and even under Aegis changes you could temporarily fuck with outposts with entosis shutting down station services. Now it's ignore the structure or grind it out for a week to no reward.
---
Are we forgetting about POSes?
---
Still got my tempest from 2 years ago that I used in a Provi kitchensink fleet. Lots of our fleet came in battleships for the heck of it and we fought against an enemy kitchensink fleet that also had lots of battleships. We rolled into them at point blank and ships were exploding all around me. 
---
Nothing's more fun then fighting with and against ships people tend to be comfortable with. And seeing so much variety in ships people fly makes the fleet all the more lively.
---
An overall buff to battleship scan res, lock range and ehp would go a long way to bring them back.
---
Mineral supplies is infinite. We don't run out of minerals and we never will. New asteroid belts keep spawning and moon mining etc. As long as there are more people mining the said minerals than the people destroying them, anything that is built with minerals will cost less and less. If something increases in price that is built with minerals, that is because minerals coming into economy is fewer.   
---
This is different for PLEX. If more ISK is introduced to the game (attention that this is liquid ISK, not minerals) through faucets and leaving the game through sinks, then you have inflation. Null-ratting causes this because it's income is through bounties. Not through modules, salvage or minerals. The more bounties earned through botting and such, the less your ISK is valued because now there are more ISK in the game. And PLEX is tied to this equation.
---
I'm not going to play a game that I don't enjoy anymore, especially when the devs treat the symptoms eather than the sources of problems.
---
I'd be 100 % for a non-flat resource distribution across New Eden. I'd be 100 % for changes in sov mechanics. I'd be 100 % for resource depletion and slower regeneration. I'd also partially be for a  complete rework of the caps that is VERY well thought out that include communication with the playerbase (official polls, input from CSM, etc). I'd be for a rework of the current skill system as well (the current one favours alts rather than activity, thus new players leave when they realise they have to spend a lot more than one sub in order to fully experience the game).
---
But CCP has showed that they don't care to do things that requires actual dev time. So, we'll have to see what they put on the table next.
---
i think there was a very good idea about isk sinking. but spodbrains killed it before it got to CCP https://forums.eveonline.com/t/npc-sells-minerals-isk-sinking-idea/121026
---
I can live with this
---
Good discussion on the Malcanis's Law angle. I don't think there's any way to do this in the current system of static K-space anom farming. It'd have to be located in mobile incursion targets, deadspace sites or Abyssal sites to get out of the umbrellas. (Even if it were just "what if ratting gilas made 400m/hr but no local and lots of hunters" shooting red dots isn't satisfying gameplay, and neither is getting ganked with no backup by cloaky T3Cs. We need a *total* overhaul of the PvE system, on all fronts, not just risk/reward rebalancing.)
---
You also have it make it worth their time to go out in space and PVE
---
well bots returning should make ccp happy at least, more accounts buying plex
---
This is so incorrect dude, the hunters life didn't get harder. Carebears are able to farm imbalanced ships that make PvP lack depth, which is why pvpers are leaving.
---
All this does is force people to figure out how to not use the alliance/standings system.
---
Recent population decline is just some bots not logging in and people playing Classic. Not sure why people make a rocket science out of it.
---
Normal gameplay.
---
How about when you load you don't show up until you break cloak but you also can't see local or DScan. Then the timing is the same.
---
I hope blackout reversal is enough to bring subs up. Many unsubbed due to cyno changes, not blackout.
---
Regarding hulk's escaping death: 
---
It's almost as if you should have to defend people who are working your resources. That you should have a defense fleet, or maybe a Rorqual with remote shield boosters so you can keep your skiffs alive while your defense fleet defends
---
Regarding owning sov based on local chat:
---
If you noticed in my last post I avoided using the word sov. That is because what the game says you own on paper is pointless if you can't defend it. If I own a section of space but raiders raid without me defending it, it really isn't my space now isn't it? The extent of your sovereignty extends only as far as you can defend it. We see this IRL too. If you establish a country and you have no means to defend it from another country, it's not really your country anymore right?
---
To be honest I would be fine with that too.
---
FFS Chaos changes have been the best changes to the game in years.
---
Can't imagine there is any legitimate complaints about blackout. Local's just an intelligence tool and anybody who claims otherwise is just trying to hide their true agenda, which is highly likely to be grinding at minimal risk. There's plenty of other in game channels and out of game platforms for chatting. Carebears going to get their way as usual though.
---
The cyno changes were great too. Hotdropping is a crappy mechanic, there's no skill to it, it's lazy and means people aren't out and about looking for fights, they're sitting on a titan/in a capital/blops etc.
---
yep. for sure.
---
Honestly Rick, what happened to you man. You used to put so much effort into getting (pvp) content, now you're someone that complains that it doesn't just simply jump at you on the next corner and parade for the carebear meta in your free time. If that's what *adapting* looks like then i wonder why you wouldn't see that many chose to die instead.
---
OK, if we're putting stuff up wherever we like what stops me from deploying one in Delve with a fake alliance just to troll?
---
That's an intriguing idea. Scale like the triv ships where the longer it's applied the more damage it does?
---
I have a big dick, banged alot of hot chicks, went to war three times; I just like eve... nerd...
---
Any external "reason" CCP specifically could provide would also be artificial and hollow if you feel that way. You're supposed to do stuff because you like doing stuff. Otherwise all hobbies are a waste of time, since liking them is the reason for doing them when you have time from "surviving". I may sound like a bad fortune cookie, but meaning tends to come from within.
---
Because the game isn't only about killing, you have to have something to kill, and I have always understood this. Prey must exist before hunters. Period.
---
Remove, or dramatically increase the damage cap.
---
&gt; The current gank meta also just favors extreme responses. You need to force off 250 bombers. 
---
Definitely, but bringing 250 bombers is just what we started doing to secure kills before the response fleet landed anyway. We're reaching the endgame on the hunting meta in a lot of ways. Smallgang to null is dead; if you wanna PvP in someone else's sovnull, you bring blackops, and *lots* of it. Most good hunters worked almost exclusively through blue eyes pre-blackout, to stay out of intel. So on, so forth. The endgame we're approaching here is a true No Fites Meta: all content is one-sided dunks, including in wars, where "victory" is decided when the weaker side unanchors all their shit and leaves before the attacker even finishes deploying.
---
This is true, the occasional engagement in low sec does keep the sec low though!
---
I hate the idea too but at this point I'd try just about anything. 
---
Remember, you can still have non-instanced PvP on the abyssal trace when you escape with all the loot and half structure remaining.
---
They hurt the bank account though!
---
We were joking on comms later how it would have been pretty fucking hilarious if you guys just warped an Obelisk in and scooped it.  
---
 Like, Exo said "I'd just have to put on the Pirates of the Carribean theme if I saw an Obelisk manage to roll in from warp after, scoop it, and moonwalk out with our fortizar."
---
&gt;They need to fix : Rorquals Injectors HAW weapons Fighters
---
It's a revenue source now. 
---
Sadly, they won't be able to take this back.
---
The game's been moving away from that for, and I'm not exaggerating, years. When I started in 2012 the game was a lot more "hardcore" in Nullsec than it was even during the blackout because you always had to worry about blobs of carriers being dropped on you for lols.
---
It turns out making your game "super hardcore" is less lucrative than making it simpler and easier to succeed in. The later method of game design, naturally, allows more people to succeed. More people succeeding means more people paying, which means more money for the company.
---
depends on how far back you want to go
---
Yea, and hundreds of others since ) Did you have a point?
---
So.... Get out of null and go to FW space. Each Plex has an acceleration gate that restricts ship sizes. Inside each Plex is a rich micro-meta.  If you are tired of the stale null combat then try out FW.
---
&gt; You're supposed to do stuff because you like doing stuff.
---
i like doing stuff that's worth while - the current mechanics are such that there's nothing worth while about wasting my time trying to shoot other players, as there's no reason to so.
---
that's entirely down to the current mechancis implemented in the game by ccp.
---
more space isn't required, and providing them with content doesn't benefit me in any way. i have no reason to go and engage other players in an adversarial manner.
---
Everyone just needs to stop whinging on here and play the game.
---
No you are right you should allways live no matter how unprepared you are an instant rescue fleet should be able to jump to you. Maybe even from the other side of eve as it is clearly the hunters fault as they didn't prepare themselfes to fight off 50 titans, those scrub hunters.
---
Vegan Wormholers : " OMG we need this changes, please Olmeca Thunberg, save our souls."
---
Also Vegan Wormholers: "OMG, we can not find any dank VNI Ganks anymore, why do these Bad Carnivore Nullsec Bears stop playing EvE? "
---
You elite Solo/Smallscale Elitists could ask for Battlegrounds maybe? Oh wait, you have these already. But you dont look for gud fights, all you wanted where dank Kills from Carebear Pubbies.
---
No, logarithmic scaling is diminishing returns on more and more damage. So if 10 dreads took 20 minutes to kill a structure, 50 dreads would take 15 minutes, and 200 dreads would take 10 minutes, and 2000 dreads would take 5 minutes. None of my example are to scale but you get the general idea of exponentially increasing damage to get slightly more damage applied.
---
&gt;My guess: they're doing some testing of how these changes affect the playerbase
---
You don't have to guess, CCP said from the start blackout was mainly to test things. Not sure why everyone didn't get that memo, expecting this to last forever.
---
What is a carebear? Someone who mines and does indy?
---
Anyways, as a newer player it feels like the risk in the game is already super high, I can lose my ship at any moment, I dont know if I would keep playing the game if the risk was even higher. I get that some people are looking for content, but at the cost of everyone else? I dont know, maybe I just dont know enough
---
you really are against putting any effort in at all
---
I agree with this. It's a much less binary change than no local, and it errors much more toward the crab side, so it shouldn't creating a mass exodus of concurrent pve accounts. 
---
Yet it buffs roaming somewhat without being super powerful for cloaky ships. 
---
I also agree that its dumb that someone can respond to your action while you're watching a loading screen. 
---
But hey, we're playing a PVE game now so any change that would minutely buff PVP is bad.
---
I remember when building stations was hard...
---
There's a lot to do in EVE, some easy to get into, others not so much but there is plenty of middle ground. 2-4 hours is more than enough time. It's going to be a bit overwhelming at first and the tutorial isn't very helpful but along with Google and YouTube, you can generally find an answer to your question(s).
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Here's a nice potential careers overview picture to confuse things even more :) and there's no reason you can't do more than one or even all of them. 
---
Take your time, figure out what you enjoy and go from there
---
https://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post_img/eve-career-chart.jpg
---
This is definitely the angle I'd take on it. Encourage people to put their ship at high risk for an hour or two, to make rewards equal to several times the value of that ship. But don't let them do it 24/7 (not bottable anymore!) and leave them some time to go on a roam or do the laundry or whatever.
---
While I know that the book mark database got stupid, warp to zero fucked a lot of the small gang hunting
---
this game is made with multiboxing in mind. Do you expect every jf runner to have a bunch of friends lighting his cynos to move stuff around?
---
Do you have a good group to play with?
---
Yes? Easy to get into.
---
No? Extremely hard to get into.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University
---
I don't like any of it. A lot of MMOs limit you to one account online. But it's not something I expect.    
---
Incursion multi boxing, mining multi boxing, ns krab land multi boxing, all the multi boxing just removes the social aspect of Eve that makes it fun.
---
im prety sure u gona see them back in pb on monday
---
tl;dr - there's nothing worth fighting over, so people don't fight (other than pre-arranged bullshit)
---
For a 12yo kids that play the game 2h/day for 3months, i said its TOO MUCH SALT
---
and CCP call people like you player base
---
WTF
---
IS THIS WORLD FOR REAL?
---
Making a alt is the only way I have found
---
This isn't a foodchain, pvp consists of more than just loki vs nullsec ratting sub/barge. And on the other side people that do pve aren't just lone sheep on a farm that got flooded by wolves because blackout removed the fence. Your view on this matter is way too onedimensional. But on the other hand if that's how the game is seen now, safe farms with some wolves circling around them then go back to the last part of my above comment.  
---
P.S. even if that kind of analogy wasn't utter garbage it would still go both ways. and not just that, it's even more nuanced. I'll leave it to you how you want to interpret my words.
---
 It to mention the effort it took to maintain stations.
---
Lol...or that it’s somehow wrong.  
---
All the recent changes have made this the primary endpoint.  You are supposed to live in your space, build things, rat and mine, upgrade and defend.  If you leave your space for any reason, the ADMs start to tank.  
---
The problem is that this set of incentives does not increase destruction in NS.  You literally can’t leave your SOV for any real time and hence the mismatch between gathering/production and destruction.  
---
Want to decrease ratting/mining...get in a fricking war.  No mining in a war zone. 
---
Too many Titans in game...get in a war and blow them up. 
---
Change SOV, structure mechanics, and incentives to take space, and NS will be ‘dangerous’ again.  Not like a shitty LS version of dangerous, with small gangs hunting ratters/miners, but big fleet dangerous.
---
SEAGULL got the ANSWER im pretty sure...that women fucked eve pretty bad
---
Join a non-wardecced corp
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
This, 100%, as a dirty highsec krab of 16 years nobody ever really cares about my dumb opinion but I'm ok with that, but watching new shiny things get bolted on to a core that's slowly rusting just makes me sad to watch it continue.
---
***&gt;  This isn't a foodchain*** 
---
This is where I disagree. EVE devs have devoted thousands of hours that it is a food chain, starting from that single unit of veldspar and how it helps and produce the thousands of different things that you use to PVP.
---
This statement is remarkably naive.
---
Are you saying that being direct and transparent about your intentions and plans towards your paying customers would've been better?!?   
---
YOU FINKING HERETIC, WHAT MILLENIA YOU THINK YOU ARE LIVING!
---
how about deleting highsec too
---
CONGRATULATIONS, still irrelevant.
---
Munnin was fun when elo came back but it became the go to normie ns ship after everyone copied him. F
---
I can live with that too :)
---
Wrong again you total dipshit, I told you I wasn't going to explain it *directly to you*. Once again, the world does not revolve around whether or not you're spoonfed. You asked, I told you to read it in my comment history.
---
remeber good old days when sabre scout was going to station and buble undock...pretty nice fights was ensuing...i would leave active guns only on athanors to defend miners,for the rest of space dicks ,guns active only on rf timers...also remove thetering bulshit while u got a timer(NPC or aggro player)
---
it's obvious that there was "If you go down this path Hilmar, I will have nothing to do with it and I'll quit" - discussion ...
---
And how in the world did he manage to join a fleet before his client loaded?
---
that would just help bigger alliances though
---
Upwell War.
---
Upwell vs Triglavians.
---
Upwell citadels made the game too safe.
---
"Safety has been in the crosshairs for over a year and the game is trending towards unsafe. (no surprise people who are not subbed, who do not play eve don't know)"
---
You probably dont play for very long, or forgot, that eve used to be way more dangerous before the introduction of citadels. Also, what are the changes, other then blackout and cyno, that made eve more dangerous in the past year? in the last content patch they released the ansiplex gates which you can use while tackled AND while agressed.
---
I guess people voted with their wallet, much like some people told them to do if they didn't like the changes.
---
Personally i quit further back when i saw plex becomming n+1 and ccp did nothing to stop inflation/ moneygrab.
---
I do respect your opinion but, I'm just not convinced that the CSM should be listened to.  The optics are that they are only trying to serve their playstyle at the expense of the game as a whole.  I said "optics" in particular as, for years, the CSM has been dominated my null-blocks and almost all the "changes" over the last 10 years have favored making null easier.   We'll see ...
---
&gt;Also, how much time will one need to put into the game to get better?
---
not much - one of the double edged swords of eve is the training system. skills train in real time, even if you're logged out. (you can make this faster with skill injectors if you want to convert cash (either in-game currency or irl currency). however if you have limited time to play you'll always come back to a "better" character than you logged out of last time.
---
I fear not even James315 can save us.
---
Some people do NOTHING but trading never even leave the station.
---
Some people do NOTHING but PVE unless forced into it.
---
Some people do NOTHING but industry.
---
Some people do NOTHING but hauling and the closest they come to PVP is gank attempts.
---
Some people do NOTHING but PVP, sometimes to the point of stupidity!
---
IE. Using a multibillion isk Loki(I checked his most used fit) trying in vain to kill my 2 million isk Rifter burning over an hour of your life whilst amusing me no end is STUPID sez I!
---
Moving on.
---
Some people have no interest in interacting with others except to the extent necessary.
---
Some people have no interest in the game UNLESS they can interact with others.
---
The whole point of a sandbox is do what the hell you want and or do what the hell you can.
---
Bitching about or trying to get the company to (often foolishly) do something about how OTHER people play the game ain't sandbox.
---
Yet you constantly see people bitch about 
---
I don't like how someone else is playing
---
I don't like what someone else is playing with (their toys)
---
Now on to another point.
---
Interesting comment:
---
"without PVPers there would not be an incentive to be a PVE-er most of the time".
---
Why not? PVPers aren't or wouldn't be the only customers since customers are the ultimate point of PVE.
---
Now as for botters and botting. Ultimately there is NOTHING you are CCP can do about it.
---
Why? I'm not even a botter and or excessively "techy" but just as an intellectual exercise I figured out 7 unstoppable ways around the last bot hunt/bot blocks,counter-measures in less than on hour without trying terribly hard. Don't ask. Ain't tellin'.
---
My point is if I can do that just for fun, what do you think someone techy or who can HIRE someone techy and even more importantly someone who has skin in the game(no pun intended) meaning making money whether its real or just for in game  can do and will have ALREADY done?
---
No one has removed bots. No one CAN remove bots. NPCs are bots. They just happen to be controlled by CCP.
---
Do bots make the value of sites lower for PVE players? Almost certainly. By the way I never specifically said I was..I do A LOT of things. Depending on my whim.
---
On interacting:
---
When I'm doing something that does not benefit one way or another from interacting with other players then I don't.
---
If I'm doing something that directly requires me to interact with other players, like fleet, then I do.
---
If I'm doing something that neither fish nor fowl, I do what I feel like.
---
Lastly for now:
---
The thing that irritates me about bot mania is it reminds me of "The Drug War" Both of which are complete BULLSHIT if you look at the situations realistically.
---
i dont see the ones ratting 24/7 paying any real money on this game
---
I dont think having a 200 man standing fleet for for countering a possible 200 stealth bomber fleet is easily doable. 
---
In any case a standing fleet can operate only if th crab is a rorq or a super.
---
most war deccers hang around in heavily trafficed systems. aka trade/mission hubs.
---
it's hilariously rare to see them outside of those systems.
---
People keep saying this but can you say what actually changed? Only 2 things have changed with regards to resource distribution:
---
-the t2 bottleneck was move from a regional r32 to r64s
---
-highsec and lowsec moons give low end moongoo and null minerals
---
Because you can still have an open sandbox whilst providing incentives.
---
Or at the very least make it so its not an enormous ballache to take sov or go offensive.
---
Even if you disagree with providing incentives and that people should "just do it" on their own (even though there's no reason to)
---
Surely you'd agree that its not in anyones interest to make it extremely difficult to do that?
---
No. I’m just kind of wondering if you need a therapy dog or something.
---
CCP let players down by losing their vision.  Those who left in the past far outnumber those leaving now.
---
So many cool aspects of this game have been pwned by jump freighters, caps and anoms.
---
Are skill injectors such a problem? They give me incentive to grind and acticely play instead of just waiting around for it. Until a few days ago I was at 8mil SP, I spent hours doing invasions, abyssals etc and was able to afford a skill injector! Which made me feel like my work is helping me progress instead of eve being a waiting game.
---
A supply chain isnt a food chain.
---
Well the problem is structure spam, so anything that removes structures would be good.
---
I would say it's someone who primarily cares about mining, industry and ratting. To a carebear or krab, PVP is just a means to take or defend space that allows them to pursue these activities.
---
It is, because my thread is about Lion King/EVE metaphors.
---
soon we achieve serenity status,farmville style gona kill eve anyway
---
Lol wrong without players that do pve your pvp habit would not exist.
---
Delete *.*
---
The problem I have with that is as you are gating you will still get reported in intel channels.  The intel channels / near2 is what really needs the nerf.
---
So you literally want to break the game, and you try to disguise that as "let us play the way we want". You can do that within the confines of balance.
---
I wanna see the bad guys for sure. I'm not sure I want to see how much the number of local blues has changed.
---
Yes, but it feels like the reward system is worthless at this point. Glassing of tribute happened few months ago, something that would have been incredible news, a mighty empire refusing to fight, fleeing their space and several keepstars dying, but it had not even fraction of impact it should have.
---
Titans are still advertised as a catastrophic weapon of destruction that is incredibly rare, but in reality they are used to do PvE(I'm still amazed how these ships are able to do content that was clearly designed for subcaps), this is one of the examples of how worthless the "success" has become
---
Someone who exclusively rats and mines and avoids any conflict with other players.
---
And yeah the risk for an individual player is fairly high, however for a place like Nullsec where that risk is distributed across the organization that holds sov, risk is fairly low. Kind of a power in numbers kind of thing.
---
Uh, I typed his name right in zkill and he came up immediately.
---
&gt; Conflict just for entertainment (which is fine as a premise for a game) has to be balanced with the people who do not seek out such conflict (it is a sandbox after all). 
---
Highsec exists. Why should nullsec, traditionally a high risk area, be tailored for people who don't want to live in a high risk area?
---
Isnt that fine in of itself? Fighting for a purpose instead fighting for the sake of fighting? Why are carebears a problem? 
---
Personaly I spend most my time doing invasion fleets and abyssals, so basicaly 99% content and making good isk at it, if Carebears are such a problem, they could just do that stuff right?
---
ccp just milked the money from ppl going rorquals
---
What changes have I suggested that break the game? The blackout broke the game and was driving away players in the 1000s and you can’t hack that you arnt getting your own way! Go to your quiet place snowflake, maybe tomorrow it won’t be so bad or just quit then you don’t have to worry about how other people all over the planet don’t want to play the game the way you do 😀
---
Not really, it only made it harder for people who can't no-life the game to participate in nullsec wars. Super umbrellas were still there, rich players who were protected before were still protected, only now regular players who wanted to just grind out some cash to do shoot some ships were left out to dry with only "adapt or die" as the parting shot.
---
The only reason I was able to afford PvP before blackout while taking care of an infant and working full time was because I could take care of the little guy while grinding out some anomalies. When blackout happened and people like me asked for help figuring out ways to make ISK all we got was "suck it up, nullbear". So we left because people were acting like assholes.
---
Just because you liked a change doesn't mean you're right, though that fact seems to have been lost on everyone here.
---
&gt;Also muninn fleets actively disencourage capital on capital action since there is no reason to drop carriers anymore really which in turn makes dropping dreads/escalating useless  
---
Yes this is the point.  
---
There's not an overall point where there's really a massive variety in the meta. At one point it was Drakes, at one point Ishtars, and T3Cs, and Slowcats, and on and on.  
---
Right now the meta's at least somewhat varied. You see Jackdaw fleets, MJD sniper fleets, Stukas, Muninns, Lokis, etc.  
---
The big reason I like a cruiser meta (and to be fair Machs aren't that bad in this regard for obvious reasons) is because if you burn 10 jumps for blueballs, it doesn't mean you're going on a fucking 40 minute round trip for nothing. They're small enough to bridge a shitload of for no real cost, and burning back is no big time investment.
---
[Armor Hacs, ARMOR hacs, ARRRRRMOR HACS!!!!!!!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-kGGW0UlPA)
---
So If I was part of a big alliance in null sec right now I wouldnt need to worry about being killed at all? I thought those big alliances like Goons and Test are losing titans all the time? Cant imagine losing such ships regularly is trivial, or is it?
---
&gt; other then blackout and cyno, that made eve more dangerous in the past year 
---
Pay the sub you impoverished scum
---

r/eve is acting angry about this but none of you should be surprised considering the responses you gave to people who didn't agree with you.
---
Blackout only made it harder for people who can't no-life the game to participate in nullsec wars. Super umbrellas were still there, rich players who were protected before were still protected or could tank losses, only now regular players who wanted to just grind out some cash to do shoot some ships were left out to dry with only "adapt or die" as the parting shot by r/eve.
---
Blackout was completely dumb imo. No one of sane mind would keep running worthless anoms in null under such conditions. Massive risk and scant reward. 
---
You cant increase risk tenfold and keep reward the same.
---
I really cant fathom why couldnt there have been some sort of a middle ground. Not perfect safety and neither a total lack of it.
---
Add some sort of a delay to appearing in local after a gatejump. Make the delay longer if coming from a WH. Add more scrams to sites. Introduce capital escalations into them. And most importantly, make them worthwhile to run, adjust the reward according to risk. 
---
If CCP is incapable of combatting botting then make the sites harder to bot. Do away with bounties and place some physical loot into a can. Kill all the rats first, then complete an unbottable minigame to claim the loot. Dead rats could drop clues towards completing the minigame. Or whatever, you have a goddamn spaceship game, anything goes.
---
I could go on and on about site depletion and migration but that horse is hamburger meat at this point.
---
This won't hurt bots, good ones have characters a jump out and use the intel channels to dock up before you even enter system.
---
people don't live in c2s for the isk, they live there because they want to pvp out of the null static
---
Hard no if it involves structures.  I'm all for keeping blackout, but fuck that structure bullshit.
---
You missed a /s
---
feel same...dont play anymore like used to...war thunder is better
---
O7
---
The game would die without miners.
---
And what is wrong with using the local intel that CCP designed into the game?  I personally enjoy mining as a part of my Eve gameplay. I don’t even mind more risk or less yield while mining if CCP decides I can make too much Isk from the time spent playing.  
---
My greater concern is why should my style of gameplay magically be decided as bad and eliminated from the game?
---
Quiet lorenzo. Dave says hi.
---
&gt;We want to but the change has to be gradual and not biased towards any one playstyle. Removing local altogether was an extreme change, heavily biased towards one style of play: Hunting. 
---
This. So many people just don't get it. They want \*their\* playstyle to be more fun at all cost, even if that means making the game shitty for other players. That's just a really egocentric attitude to have imho.
---
Everyone argues that EVE is a sandbox, but at the same time, certain players want a certain playstyle to dominate and even make others leave. "Unsub you noob" they say - without realising that they are pushing "their content" out of the game.
---
Honestly, this community sucks because it's so self-centered and incapable of understanding the "other side", only trying to push for changes that give \*them\* a better experience, while shitting on all the others who enjoy other playstyles.
---
After all these years and plenty of vets in their 30s (and older) one would expect people have become more mature and more open-minded, able to see things from different perspectives and trying to discuss possible changes in a constructive way - but the opposite is the case, both on reddit and the forums.   
---
CCP sure is to blame, but so is this immature community full of manchilds.
---
Nah, I did not.
---
I never quite got this poem/copypasta.
---
Someone is salty!
---
The Killmail is your reward good sir. Treasure, value it and one day you shall be king.
---
Ah right no underscore.
---
Right but humans will maximize results and right now there is no reason to fight
---
No i'm serious, what you described is the supply chain in the industry of the game, and yes there went much work into it. 
---
Even the pvp among the people that participate in it is to an extent part of it as it is generates consumers aswell as reinjecting ressources in the form of loot from dead ship.  
---
But it's supposed to by dynamic and not a vertical foodchain of defined playertypes that are stronger as the ones under them. The leader of an alliance that is basically only widely known for pvp mining barges should understand this tbh.
---
That would be great to find some enemies and start shooting each other. But when CCP puts in a very suspect mechanic (Drifter Invasion) that had the exact effect of ending a major conflict, then what the hell are we supposed to do.
---
Still not convinced that GM/Devs at CCP deliberately targeted specific system to end that conflict.

You want the isk printer turned on. Having it off drove away players who want null sec income with high sec safety. This cannot be accommodated.
---
You first have to solve the problem with mega coalitons. There is no reason to fight as long as the 2 biggest coalitions jerk each other off. Just remember the last tribute war where the defender didn't even show up because it was pointless fighting.
---
Easy ganks - you require safety in numbers. You don’t fight outnumbered and you certainly have the odds in your favour. As a line member goon try and change the goon mentality from the inside starting with yourself. Please
---
Oops, I meant SLS
---
delete frigate wormhole too.
---
Let's not pretend battleships are good even if there are no caps. Their immobility, low resists compared to HAC/T3, and vulnerability to bombs means that people would still bring Eagles/Muninns over them.
---
&gt; this is one of the examples of how worthless the "success" has become
---
It's important to contextualize what "success" looks like. Back in the day (God that's weird, I'm only in my 20's!) Success for CCP was continuing to provide player driven, balanced risk/reward content. Now that CCP is owned by Pearl Abyss, a company with vastly different goals for their products, that vision of "success" has likely changed.
---
You sound very uninformed to those of us in the middle of smaller alliances who experienced what was actually happening.  Most of my corp of pve/builders is gone now.  None of them were bots and none of them went to Classic.  The game was fundamentally changed to their detriment and so they quit.  
---
When blackout made it so that builders with no umbrellas couldn't mine anymore, and they didn't care for the company of the big alliances, there really was no option but to quit or piss away your assets providing contents to the pvp'rs.
---
It's not rocket science.
---
Perfect timing. Chat servers just died. My fleet window won't even open.
---
Deaths still happen but having lived in High/Low*, and Null, I'd say that until blackout Null was the safest place to live. The intelligence networks that are were running pre-blackout meant that you would know about enemies 8+ jumps away, so of you were paying attention, for the most part you could just dock up. The only thing that could really surprise you would be people invading from wormholes. However once they join your system they would appear in local and give you fairly ample time to get safe before they could find you. Ultimately if you payed attention to local and Intel channels you would be very unlikely that you would get into combat unless you wanted to. The risk was low.
---
 Now roll back cyno changes so i can move my shit there and we're talking.
---
The way plex works is that somebody somewhere is paying for that game time.  Dozens of accounts ratting and mining are still being paid for even if it isnt the player themselves paying for it
---
injectors allowing people to inject into capital ships, that is not a catch up it's just P2W. I've said it for ages, Injectors were a great idea but they should of had limitations you shouldn't be able to inject into capital anything. 
---
Jump fatigue - it used to be hardcore if you repeatedly jumped and because of that good planning was required to move a capital. 
---
Citadels - They are awful for the game, they just make safe havens that can be quite easily defended and when people lose their safe space they don't log in much any more.
---
Eve used to be a more hardcore, brutal and unforgiving experience that rewarded you for seeing through the bad times but CCP turned it around to a very safe experience and then when any sort of chaos comes around you find swathes of people leaving the game due to their bubble being popped, vs being prepared for that eventuality due to the struggle of even getting a bubble for yourself going in the first place. 
---
Eve has rapidly changed and lost some of what made it such an enticing world and I can't help but point my finger at some groups for reaping the rewards happily instead of fighting against it.
---
The obvious reason to attack anyone would be to loot their structures. Asset safety is terrible.
---
I have seen wormhole evictions result in a hundred billion isk drops from killed citadels. Thats how it should always be in nullsec too.
---
Consider the fact that citadels take 2 weeks to kill there is plenty of time to move the bulk of an alliances wealth out of a dying citidel. But there will still be some drops which encourage fighting.
---
Vily said of the summit : "it's good that we were there". Another member said something like we dispelled some myths.
---
What the fuck, CCP buys into myths about its own game?
---
Legit question. How does that happen
---
This is one of the better middleground suggestions. Local can actually be a diminishing return mechanism to player groups growing larger and denser, which most argue to be impossible.
---
I think CCP shud take what's good from this . Local not revealing people under gate cloak should be a mid ground and if more so how about giving force recons immunity to local .
---
I don't think it's a problem personally, I've been playing this game for long enough to realize that it doesn't matter if you're a highsec miner, code ganker, wardeccer, wormhole small ganger, cloaky camper, nullsec linemember, or whatever else you want to be. Every playstyle is valid.
---
People who dislike "carebears" usually think that their playstyle goes against theirs. Carebears don't care about "good fights", when you come to their space it's in their best interest to do everything for you to *not* have fun, in order to prevent you from coming back.
---
Definitely part of the decline but not all.  I dropped from 4 to 2 accounts and was planning to drop to 1 if blackout continued.  Why should I keep spending money on accounts when the changes that have recently happens remove the fun from the game?   Not for everyone, but me specifically. 
---
I absolutely love the game, but am not having nearly as much fun as I did just 3 months ago.
---
Lately is seems more like more people who see it as a PVE game where any attempt at PVP is a crime against humanity.
---
Crabs like this are the most boring thing to hunt. At least with bots you have the challenge of figuring out how they work... Here they will just dock when you're 3+ jumps out. The only thing they're good at is when calling in the response fleet, aka the actual fun part (when they don't just cyno supers on you that is).
---
Lets go one step further and delete all wormholes
---
not to mention a cloaky could really ruin your day, there was a chance for counter ops.
---
i mean.... it did happend quite often before the blackout aswell..

this took me like 4 minutes to find.
---
Lol line member ok...
---
It'd need to be limited by availability somehow, so you can't just farm it 24/7. You could also make the rewards available something you have to compete with other players to get; like, there's 300m worth of loot in cans around the site, but you have to either grab what you can get and run, or fight the other people for the best drops.
---
Is this the eve version of being paid for exposure?
---
Thank you for the explanation! Much appreciated
---
&gt;botter vets  
---
Not sure if typo or intentional but i lol'd
---
Also I forgot to the second question you had. To expand on the triviality of losing a Titan. I'm not sure how hard it hits people since I have just started to dip my feet into capital gameplay after focusing on near perfecting my subcap skills. However when I first started in 2015 it was so rare to see titans. Like I didn't see my first Titan until a year after joining. However these days it seems like titans are an everyday occurance. I see several daily it seems like.
---
alt is only option
---
This 100%. If CCP had gone with a local delay of say 30sec-1min, it would of gone down waaaay better than no local.
---
Citadels definitely contributed to the state of things now. They had no system to limit them, made them too cheap, too safe, and not  worth grinding either.
---
Isnt denying others fun kinda a-hole-ish in a game? Like thats the point of the game
---
It never failed because it was too huge. It failed due to being a core mechanic of the game since eve was made.
---
They done it properly before by introducing wormhole space, the lore to go with it etc etc
---
If CCP want to shake the game up properly then they could start with a huge sweeping ship rebalancing that has been badly needed for years and years instead of dropping on us fucking another race of ships. We hear the same shitty broken promises year after year of ship and module rebalancing and it never happens, they choose one, maybe two and then stop. We have whole classes of ships that are in the gutter with no thought or role anymore.
---
Increase fuel requirements for services by 5x. Low 0ower structures get no ref timer and die. Problem solved.
---
In your vaulted opinion it cannot be accommodated, the players of null disagree and voted with their wallets and stopped subbing and playing, why don’t you do the same and see if you can muster enough unsubs to make ccp turn blackout back on? Vote with your wallet bro, take action, and if you fail you won’t be missed and we can continue on 🦀🦀🦀
---
But I love spending 5 minutes to start up my F/A-18 because I had to memorize the start up sequence.
---
So those alliances are simply gaining more titans over time than they lose?
---
Take some friends and kick wardecer’s ass. Then you can peacefully do your hs stuffs
---
The beauty of Eve as a game is the primary reason it is in the state it's in today. As an open sandbox we are given access to components we can put together to make the best life we can. The fewer rules and restrictions the better. We were left to keep ourselves in check. As in life, there is always safety and success in numbers. The entire argument for the EU is that was the only way Europe was going to compete and protect themselves if needed against the "blobs" of the US, Russia, and China. Eve just mirrors that.
---
Other games ward off the n+1 factor by putting hard limits on groups. Teams, fleets, parties can only be x people and every encounter is our best x players vs. your best x players. CCP tried to put a soft limit on groups with corp size limits. I doubt they ever envisioned anything like the coalitions we have today. Beyond Rorquals and Supers, it's the coalitions that created and feed the stagnation. If there was a hard cap on how many could be in an alliance, and a way to prevent alliances from working together, with nothing else changed Eve would be a much more level playing field. And people will take a chance on losing if the fight will be competitive.
---
If the issue is too much mining and ratting income, this makes sense.  Reduce it in many ways that get a balance, but does not eliminate the play style entirely.   Like lower ratting bonuses, reduced yield from all types of mining, slower respawn rates, etc.
---
Each Plex has an acceleration gate and a cloaky Loki that restrict what can enter.
---
Also, FW meta is by no means rich. 
---
Novices are overrun with comets, worms and garmurs.
---
T1 dessies got powercreeped hard by the AF buff, but they still have a place.
---
Now it is either Kikimoras, Retris or Ramjags in smalls.
---
I wont even talk about mediums because recons and lokis exist. Assclapped vexors as well. 
---
Also, T3Ds have no real place in the Plex meta.
---
I did my time in FW, and it is a cancer that slowly rots your brain away. Too few good fights, too much gay cheese shit. 
---
Also, citadels
---
Your idea is bad and you should feel bad
---
Are running abyssals a bad idea if you’re in faction warfare?  I know you are a valid target from other side but is this something I shouldn’t worry about?
---
BS would be balanced with a nice 2-5x increase in raw hitpoints.
---
The hit and run cyno should have always only been a blops-only tool.
---
Having a "small gang" of carriers and FAXs dropped on anything and everything was always total horse shit.
---
The other response had a lot of good stuff in it, replying to your comment just to add a few more points of consideration.
---
* I really recommend that link I put in the original post exploring the leshak's base hitpoints.  That, even more than the dps ramp up, is what makes it so powerful in a mid gang sized battleship fight.
---
* Because of the single gun thing, heating the dps can be done for a sustained amount of time.
---
* Again because of the single gun thing, the way wrecking shot mechanics with them work give them added power in 1v1 fights.
---
some people like a challenge?
---
Honestly the one big problem i see with all these decloak structure suggestions are blops bs. They already get only very rarely used aside from bridging these days because the use they provide for their price is just not worth it. A decloak structure will only make it worse so if something like that gets introduced i suggest they get some form of resistance or immunity to it.
---
It is a game.  Maybe it doesn’t have everything we all want, but it is one of the best I have ever played.   I’ll offer feedback on what I like and hate to help make it a better game.  But I will not feel an obligation to play when it is not fun.
---
A bit ago my idea for rorqs was to change it so that you could compress rocks using a rorq from a distance so as a barge you didn't have to leave the rock.  The compression would leave something like 10% in the rorqs bay so the rorq would passively get minerals from the fleet it was boosting/protecting and not be able to mine itself (-100% bonus to drone mining yield or something)
---
Munins online is pretty boring.
---
Feel safer, not necessarily be safer.
---
CCP didn't cap them, and thats the problem. You can pop out a rorq/super/titan pilot in a few mins instead of months of training. Suddenly everyone wants to know why there are too many big ships in game. Well if there wasn't the characters to fly them....
---
would also see locator agents being used properly again
---
&gt;Yes this is the point. 
---
Everyone is allways complaining about capital proliferation and that there arent enough cap fights happening. To drop capitals you need an incentive and in the current jammer/muninn meta there just are barely any.
---
Some of the best fights (for me atleast) happened under either capital blobs or somewhat even fights between [both subs and capitals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXsiEBAQVz0). There are ways to fight under [capital/super blobs](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003189/201710242300/) with BC/battleship fleets and that makes the fights all the more fun.
---
But you are 100% right, battleships and BC's could use some align and warp speed buffs.
---
its a super cool WoW reference. #WOLTKwhen
---
I mean isnt the issue rather their access to the amounts of skill injectors? A single injector costs 800mil isk, how many injectors would they need to get a day one pilot to train into a super cap?
---
The issue is that "For us to put them in a position where they can't try to fix the game in it's current state is upsetting." is incorrect.
---
They put themselves here, and now they reap their reward, pure and simple - everyone told them injectors were a terrible idea but they forged ahead anyway. Paint it however they wish to it was a money grabbing method pure and simple, and that is fine they are welcome to that, but actions have consequences.
---
Rorqual changes, once again they were told and told it was bad and here we are they did it anyway, now minerals are worthless and T1 ships are stupid cheap. 
---
Fighter mechanics made super ratting viable, couple in HAWs and BOSON and here we go with easy ratting.
---
Then we had the delightful PLEX iteration, which as predicted meant the price went up and up and up at a crazy rate, due to adding more uses for PLEX and making it so much easier to micro-adjust the price. So what happens, of course people either quit, or find even more min-maxed ways to earn their ISK to pay for sub.
---
That is just a tiny sample off the top of my head for some of the major cases of what is wrong, it doesn't even touch on sov or structures which of course are also a huge factor. I am not innocent, just like the major portion of the game I used these to my advantages, because of course I did, I injected rorqual alts, I injected titan and super alts to fly the easily built caps, and I used extractors to farm a vast portion of my PLEX on said alts since they had no need to train. That said, I would not object to them rolling back because while I have certainly used them, it is because what sensible person won't use the tools they are given, only idiots refuse to do that because of "principles" (or of course people who don't like that playstyle which fair play to them).
---
The problem we face now is that the vast portion of the playerbase won't share my willingness to go back, potentially they joined so recently that they don't know what "back" even is. People have gotten used to safe krabbing and vast profits, buying a super with basically pocket change for fun etc. or people were born into that gameplay, so of course when you try to take their toys away they will say "well this isn't fun anymore, I'm out" and they leave,  whether they pay money or PLEX doesn't matter, they unsub that hits the bottom line of CCP and sadly. The other side to this of course is krabbers 1, 2 and 3 quitting and taking their 20 alts with them hurts far more than PvPer 1 through 5 with 4 or 5 pilots each. 
---
So whilst I feel for the position they are in, they very much put themselves in it - I feel like in this case, the milk was not only already poured all over the floor, they've smashed the bottle and left the room, and nothing they can do will put the milk back where it was, not without taking a very big hit in their pocket which as a business, they cannot and will not do. They would have to pull some unbelievably creative changes to even begin to try - track record shows that just is not going to happen, and that doesn't even count for the fact that some changes like injectors are just too much of a money maker for them to consider changing.
---
Of course they disagree, they just want their HS safety so they can keep breaking the game.
---
I'm sorry, who are you replying to and what are you on about?
---
It's not that simple. From the carebear perspective, the roaming gangs are the one trying to deny their fun by disrupting their mining and production.
---
Hmmm I understand, thanks for the insight!
---
&gt; - Fozzie sov that nobody wants to engage in
---
People didn't want to engage in sov before then. It was always terrible to take space.
---
I'm out of the loop on eve recently, what's going on here?
---
I disagree about blackout being a breath of fresh air.
---
CCP needs a new development strategy.  Their approach to blackout has been their approach to most other balance changes.  They implement a single massive nerf/buff and expect results to come out of it.  Iterative changing of the game is needed more than ever.
---
When rorqs making mad bank, its easy to afford, Mate look at the amount of injectors in Jita at the moment. thousands. Now that is serious money to CCP, first for the omega time to train skills to extract and second for the extractors themselves. They should of capped injector use for characters, but less money in that.
---
Just fly like you do in null minus bubbles, havent you learnt how to play during your time there? Are you a nullblob shit stain?
---
This is a joke post, right? 
---
You work with people that work with you. You don't work with people that basically just ignore you and tell you to shove off because your playstyle isint what they want in their sandbox (irony being it's ours.  
---
Their attitude towards the player base is driving away players just as much as their changes. So, no, I'm not going to get out there and revive the game for their sake. That's beyond the dumbest idea I've heard in awhile. I'll continue to vote with my wallet and logins until they pull their head out of their collective arses.
---
Exactly. We need to make it so that there is something to fight over and it's easier to fight over it.
---
What does mad bank mean? Like what is their income per hour?
---
I think a decent compromise would be if CCP delayed local update until ships decloak after entering system.  This way unless someone is watching the gate you could get a whole fleet in and dscanning before the enemy knew you were there.
---
They just keep not fucking listening at all.
---
I've seen *so many great ideas on this sub on how to fix these issues* ignored, none of it all that difficult.
---
Then CCP just throws stuff at the wall to see what sticks, makes it worse, introduces even more broken bullshit without fixing the last broken bullshit. 
---
Remember when they took *6 months* do anything about the injector production bug?
---
I feel all t1 citadels shouldnt get an armor timer.  I feel this would make things better to some degree.  I also feel fortizar and keepstars should cost more
---
Just set your expectations realistically, and you can put any amount of time into eve and still enjoy it.
---
A lot of people see the news about big fights and expect to be able to get into those no matter what.
---
Also finding a good corp to join will help you, as corp mates can help you find content without you having to do all the work for it.
---
CCP knows injectors cause a ton of problems, but they makes too much money for them to get rid of them.
---
Thousands left...
---
&gt; Too few good fights, too much gay cheese shit.
---
this in a nutshell for FW
---
i was there....and it was glorious.
---
It didn’t impact botting as much as people like to believe. The bots just moved to highsec. I swear some of you people would advocate turning the fucking server off to combat bots.
---
While it is kinda the total mining / ratting income, the real problem is that there is no reason to fight other blocs.  unlimited resources in each system means no need to go next door to take more space.  No reason to take more space means no reason to kill shit other than salt mining.  no reason to kill other shit means nothing dies.  nothing dies means that we all have titans and supers because it isn't like they have any maintenance on them.
---
thats overkill... give is wormhole enchancer that will make it infinite lifetime
---
Why? Doesn't everyone have to run to a trade hub at some point to buy and sell things?
---
to be fair, Elo broadcasts in the same manner he talks.
---
Last time I checked its about 130-150mill per hour. Was more before the nerfs.
---
you mean like most of reddit who called for these changes to begin with that didnt end up coming back to the game after cheering and calling for this and they would return - yet looking at the numbers thats not the case at all, you want to blame people you should be looking at reddit and the audience who ree'd for these changes saying they would return then didn't
---
The ENTIRE reason people join corps that join alliances the join coalitions that claim space, build infrastructure and stations, that organize fleets, and  set up intel channels is for increased safety. We are entitled to safety because we built the safety. 
---
We don't expect it to be perfectly safe, but we also didn't expect CCP to come along and leave the front door wide open.
---
Rudderless ship.
---
They are a problem when they are used to make endless cap and rorq alts.
---
How you are using them is fine I thin, and was their intended purpose. Again, a CCP idea that was half baked and never fixed , causing permanent damage to the economy.
---
Again, I'm not 100% because I don't have a lot of experience in it, but it seems so. It seems like capital and supercapitals have proliferated throughout the game.
---
Personally I think it is due to the introduction of skill injectors which let the richer players scale horizontally and allow multiple accounts to be high skilled (very important for quickly creating 5+ characters dedicated to mining in a Rorqual to get the minerals to build a Titan) coupled with the low risk environment of null leading to a farming of resources and ISK. This made it much easier to build capitals/supers.
---
Though, again, this is just based off speculation and hearsay. One of the reasons why I think this is true however is because I have a friend in TEST who was talking to me about how he is building supercarriers. One thing he points out is how easy it is to make capitals. Like to make a Nyx all you need is the right blueprints and the minerals. It is about as hard as making T1 ships. There aren't any planetary resources or invention or salavged goods needed to make a Nyx. It is actually a more complex process to make a Tengu than it is to make a Nyx.
---
Oh okay, I was expecting way more than that, why dont they just run lvl 5 abyssals for double that income?
---
Exactly, FRAT, gained well over 100 ish Titans in a one year timespan. When they dropped on my Komodo I was not expecting to see as many titans as I did. They really stepped up the mining, or as some say, the algorithms really stepped up the mining. They are just pumping titans into the game and so is everyone else, Goons have build cost titans if not less and with a perfect BPO and mineral abundance I’m sure you’re below the 50 bil mark. The games dying because we’ve played it too long, just like WOW this games needs a cataclysmic event to reduce the assets and isk, but CCP will not do this as it’s hurting the Korean’s pockets as the krabs stop playing and instead REE at the screen until their PVE heavy gameplay is back to proper safety once again.
---
Because lots of people multibox rorqs You just add more. Suddenly its 300mill per hour then 450, then 600.
---
Panic pisses me off everytime I see it come on.
---
I NPSI a lot, its beyond infuriating when we finally bag one and it goes into "fuck you Ill just sit here while the umbrella spools up to save me" mode.
---
just because you didnt know what a t2 ship was and probably stuck in highsec with your head in the sand doesn't mean the game didn't know.. they did
---
we need love to battleships,more dps scanres up,tracking and dps range increment,aaaaaaaand more shield/armor buffing.
---
It is a mutual balance. This is what everyone forgets.
---
We need people who do PVE in order to be able to PVP, but people who do PVE need a market to sell their wares. More death and destruction means higher demand. That in turn means that you're going to be making money that is more valuable because the inflation stays relatively balanced. 
---
If you are in a position where you favour one extreme over the other, you're going to ruin the economy by itself. An absense of PVE would mean that there is no products to be sold, but vice versa, if the PVP would be absent then you wouldn't have a reliable market to sell towards. Hence why there is an "unholy marriage" between the two sides. 
---
You can see this on Serenity before it closed. Most of the space was owned by one group or friendlies of that group which enabled extremely safe PVE. As a result, the prices of everything inflated insanely high with PLEX reaching 800m on TQ in 2014, but 5.8b on Serenity. People have too much money in-game so they are selling their PLEX for a much higher amount. As a result, you need to grind more and longer hours and effectively push a botting haven.
---
So TL;DR:
---
PVE is needed to do PVP. In order to make PVE profitable, there needs to be a market. PVP causes the largest demand on that market. Effectively PVE isn't working well without PVP. It's a balance.
---
It’s called wardecs and it means you can’t buy ships in jita without an alt
---
I understand, thank you!
---
In my posts below it shows that I agree with organizing to provide safety. However I guess I should narrow the question to "why are you entitled to perfect intel for safety" shouldn't the quality of your intelligence be based on the skill of your organization to aquire that intelligence?
---
Aww man. This is how I lit a Cyno which brought over 200 dreads to destroy a TRI Rag that detethered. Feels bad man. 
---
I hear this kind of thing all the time, and it just means people are new to the game, or forgetful.
---
There was NO glorious past, just rose colored glasses. It was all "Ishtars online" or "Maelstroms online" or " Tengus online" or "Cerbs Online" or "omg wtf why are Drakes the only things people fly!!1!1! ??? Online". Same qas said about rail feroxes, beam zealots, and the rest.
---
And the same dumb thing is always said: "in the past it was better".  No it wasn't. In the past it was the same, just not muninns. 
---
Eventually it will be some other ship dominating the meta, because everyone only ever uses the current best ship as its ship of the line.
---
They could at least put some restrictions on them.
---
They're firmly in the "throw shit at a wall" mentality now. 
---
The answers have been on this sub for *years* how to unfuck this
---
And add local!
---
Thank you both for the post and clarification. Greatly appreciated
---
I never said that the goal right now is to make Eve safer, of course it isn't. But you cant deny that this wasn't the case up until three months ago. Citadels and ansiplex gates gave Pve players unparalleled safety, Rorquals facilitated the Captial proliferation that allowed a bigger "safety net" for capital ships.
---
 I asked you what the changes, apart from the Blackout and cyno changes were, that made eve so much more dangerous in the past year. Dont you think that the high Inflation shows that eve was up until three months ago too safe for ns ratters and miners?
---
also "Pay the sub you impoverished scum" i dont even know what you mean by this i am subbed and happily playing everyday for years now. I have the feeling i am getting lectured by someone who never hunts, or pvps outside of fleets. Maybe you dont see the imbalance because you only ever seen one side of the equation.
---
Eve needs huge game redesign. Nobody want switch windows in MMO, this make Eve very unpopular. Can you imagine LOL or TES multiwindows?
---
Most "new content" is just re-badged old shit anyway that is boring as fuck.
---
No... Blackout illustrated just how cowardly the Null Sec care bears really are. If they can't see the boogeyman lurking in Local, they're too chicken shit to even bother playing.
---
You can tell how disappointed CCP is, that they have to cancel Blackout just to bring back their income. "Adapt or die" my ass. Too many sissies out there in Null.
---
Paragraphing.
---
Go look it up bud.
---
So instead we report hostiles via other methods.
---
Quit being bad.
---
This is a fact that most of the FPS 360 Noscope microgang crowd seems to miss.  Yes, there are worthless turbokrabs that do nothing else, but MOST of the krabbiest krabs I know are top PVP participation, too.
---
Uhh.. if all the full time miners quit right now, many people who think mining is boring and not rewarding would start mining because mineral prices would skyrocket. So no, the game would continue to live.
---
null bears will just unsub their accounts and cry on r/eve and the forums and CCP will be forced to change it back to instant perfect system intel.
---
any threat to their safety will be met with sub cancellations. the Null blocs are organized enough to insure that CCP will back down.
---
That is the way it is now.
---
I expect a recall on thier cyno changes soon as well. the null bears dont like that one either.
---
1 easy fix, maintenance costs.  Low power was a start, but just make the citadels become unusable in low power (e.g. no tether, no docking etc.) and only have one timer.   that and increase the fuel costs.
---
&gt; It's almost as if you should have to defend people who are working your resources. 
---
Its more efficient to just go mine in low, WH or highsec. Which is basically what we saw.
---
They would need to get rid of local everywhere, heavily nerf Concord and significantly nerf WH space before anybody is going to bother with defense fleets for miners.
---
no tether / no docking at low power structures as well.
---
more insults good for you.
---
i'll ask this how long would you keep the blackout going? 
---
what would make you end it?
---
Do you think ccp needs to make money above a point to keep running, what would you do if incharge and not making that money from one game change?
---
All I wanna know is what you're cooking today XD
---
lol aDAPT OR DIE! chaosssssssssss!
---
Right on the nose lad
---
Being able to say "I told you so" takes a bit out of the sting of the game dying, I suppose. I still vividly remember all the negative feedback to citadels and caps.
---
Don't let this post distract you from the fact that we still need a lowsec gate to Stain.
---
Says the dude to scared to not be cloaked lmao
---
+ refit + fighters if you fly armor super, High grade slave alone sets you back 2.5bil
---
All I'm saying it's not cheap, if you have to put work into it, and can't replace it with your credit card. Hell you can't even pay for subscription. 
---
Well you can rat for one, but as I've said it's become very stressful. 
---
But again I'm not anti change, the dip in overall ISK in the game did put a smile on my face. Maybe we can make EVE healthy in time.
---
Depending on who you're shooting, you can farm kills!
---
Yes.  We don't need to make it so damn easy for them though.
---
no baking this weekend unfortunately.
---
we didn't have a chance to watch this week's GBBO as we were dealing with all the new animals. the two kittens still needed watching while we were trying to get the stuff sorted as 4 ducks arrived on friday and then we picked up the 4 chickens on saturday and today we had other things to do.
---
next week is pretzels though, i've been informed. we may do something else as well to try and catch up though. on the bright side, now there are so many chickens we're definiely never going to be short on eggs!
---
I don't think its appreciated that *so many of their best guys* have moved on now. There is just a handful left while they cash out whats left of the franchise. Seems like Hilmar has wanted to move on himself forever considering his thing over the past several years is dumping millions into failed VR and mobile game trash.
---
They aren't going to put restrictions on a massive cash cow.
---
in b4 EVE Classic
---
Don't worry man, most people's sub didn't run out yet so the afk/botting force will be back in full strength from monday on
---
It's not Ishtars Online 2.0 - yes, Muninns are common, but they're not ubiquitous.
---
The reason they're so good is two things: firstly, ADC is absurdly strong when you have logi, and secondly, a cruiser fleet can dodge capital DPS but a BS/BC fleet can't, so it's another area where capitals are a problem.
---
To be honest the ADC is just too strong. Fitting a module should always be some kind of tradeoff, but pretty much any sane HAC fit will run ADC. It's also dumb for ramming AFs.
---
Lach can't fit cyno
---
lol @ the downvotes you got dont talk about WH isk! its super hard and dangerous in WHs
---
The point is that playing the game is getting stale and boring, and CCP doesn't know how to address any of EVEs huge problems apparently.
---
The whole csm and all major nullbear blocks demanded to go back. It s not a crowd you want to upset when the rest of the game is 5% of pvpers and 40% of hisec pleb who will join nullblobs sooner or later.
---
We just had the cataclysmic event that would reduce the assets and isk, and "ree" on r/eve was so strong CCP is rolling it back tomorrow.  When I started the game, I basically decided I would never own a Titan because it was too long, too hard, and not something that particularly interested me - but I could have one tomorrow if I wanted because of CCP's changes.  That's not right, and it's what's actually killing the game.
---
They just turned easy mode back on, so good time to start
---
&gt; fighting means isk sinks
---
You do know ships blowing up are an isk *faucet* right?
---
T3Cs are still good, even after the rebalance. They were absurdly OP before it. A T3C is flexible which means you can refit it for any of the 3 things and allow it to do that thing at 100% when you need it to - before the rebalance it could do all three at 110% simultaneously.
---
I think T3Cs (except Proteus) are in a fairly good place. The trouble is that Dreks outpower them in almost every way, and with the SP loss, are also cheaper.
---
Oh, I member
---
It's not ridiculous for lore reasons, but for gameplay reasons. Cloaky eyes on your structure grid or on a wormhole are a good and balanced part of the meta.
---
Stop being a sperglord?
---
Uhm, if you have looked up on PA's economic report, you would see that CCP literally earns hundreds of thousands of dollars every quarter. So they are making enough profit. So much so that CCP managed to FAIL 4 or 5 side project yet they are still making money because Eve is a cash cow for them. Any other company would have gone bankrupt if they failed one project after another. It is PA who does want to earn any less and does not care about the health of the game. 
---
Here is on more insult for you since you like it so much: get your head out of your ass.
---
Here you go friend: https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/6864437/
---
Not yet.
---
It's not though, there's a veritable plethora of things to do in EvE. You wanna shake things up. Do something different. Go outside your usual roam path, fly a different ship, do a mission, try some Indy, do Explo, go recon for your alliance, splash a wormhole, go gank in highsec, spin an asteroid, join FW. 
---
Do something different and be the change you want to see.
---
But this seems like it would result in only the bigger alliances being able to deploy and defend these structures, so they would be the ones with good intel, while the smaller ones would face a bigger challenge? Isn’t this the opposite of what we’d want?  Whatever the solution is, it needs to affect large alliances disproportionately more than smaller ones, in order to start to restore some level of balance...
---
But if you personally have no reason too, then aren't you focusing on the wrong aspect of the game for yourself?
---
Yea they want to play the game their way, without blackout they stopped playing, they no longer enjoyed it, why should they pay for something they don’t enjoy? Why should they be forced into changes they don’t want, everyone has free will dude and people used it, cancelled subs and stopped logging in and your mad, I get that, so stop subbing and stop logging in if you don’t like how the game is
---
&gt; all those things you mentioned are player made, blackout is not player made
---
Um, local chat is not player made. In fact under blackout player made organisation and scouting becomes relevant. So once again your argument actually leads to local chat being a bad idea.
---
&gt; in black out anything with a cloak could camp a system, pick when they wanted to fight, call in more guys to help, all while the ratter has is none the wiser
---
To get ships into a system they must show up on the gate grid, and on dscan. This is how we see cloaky ships moving around in J space.
---
Same tired argument again and again. People who don't deal with the overarching complications therein romanticizing a nomadic lifestyle. How exactly would you go about building infrastructure if you had to get up and move after x time? What incentive would you even have as a smaller group to take space knowing a major bloc just comes to take it in a few months not out of boredom but out of necessity? You people that spout this sperm never think about the consequences and fantasize a
---
Bout roaming death fleets. If you want to add real incentives to motivate null blocs to fight each other, introduce asset destruction. No looting, but a guaranteed loss of assets when a structure goes boom. Make it impossible to hide a super fleet. Even make it so that supers can't safe log. You defend your Keepstar or you die trying.
---
Their natural predators (bombers, HAW dreads, fighters) also need to be nerfed. Caps should "counter" battleships no harder than battleships "counter" cruisers.
---
Citadels were criminally underthought. Even when they were released at first it was beyond obvious they needed at least another 6 months in the oven, not even at feature parity with NPC stations. Letting them proliferate all over Hisec was a mistake, tethers were a mistake, asset safety is BS, not tied into SoV mechanics, no limiter otherwise how many can be where or what size.
---
Everything about it was a total fuckup, and still is.
---
&gt; CCP Falcon is a community manager.
---
He's responsible for the message CCP wants to give to the playing community. He is the face and voice of CCP. Telling gamers to HTFU or get out (which is essentially what was said) is the absolute worst thing that could have been done, whether you agree or disagree with blackout and it's ramifications. Players called his bluff and logged off, and now it's going to be a lot harder to get back community trust. The direction CCP wants to take Eve remains unclear, and that's not good for the economy or for new player retention of confidence. It's like the president breathing the words 'recession' on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Consumer confidence is lost, and when that happens, a downward spiral begins. As much as I like Falcon (and I've met him), he did a terrible job in messaging prior, during and even in ending blackout. He obviously needs help, and maybe getting rid of the community 'team' wasn't the brightest things CCP did in the last couple of years.
---
Alternatively, battleships would be balanced with only a 50% or so increase in EHP, and capitals/supercapitals have their EHP cut down to a third and DPS/active rep by half.
---
The tiers indicate which group gives out higher rewards currently. Naturally, people chasing isk are in the higher tier.
---
When the CSM is 70% goons and people wonder why things are they way they are now...
---
I'm  just so excited for all those little guys to start thriving again.
---
change the STUPID mining &amp; farming isk mech.
---
Make mining a 1000 people @ 3 hours task rather than 100 people @ 24 hours one.
---
for example: 
---
new ship---rorq-XL
---
can only mine a specific asteroid only appearing in low sec. 
---
can not be repaired during mining. 
---
10x speed than normal rorq, 20x price than normal rorq. 
---
The asteroid will run out after 3 hours mining, however, only 5 rorq-XL can mine it simultaneously.
---
\--------
---
key idea:
---
you need fleets to protect your mining, you need to fight to save your mining. 
---
Make mining a multiple-player-available-only work, never make it a multi-boxing-available work.
---
and the most important of all, CCP, forget this shit idea FOREVER: PVE must not be the penalty for lossing a fight in PVP
---
&gt;  Everyone krabbing with caps will just reach into their deep pockets and inject a recon alt to sit cloaked nearby
---
That recon alt will get blapped if its on grid. Off grid, and the response fleet is going to respond much slower.
---
Cyno changes give defenders a lot more opportunities to screw up.
---
Only if your 0.0-corp isn't wardecced. Then you can just use a jumpclone to go back to High-sec and do anything you wanted.
---
The downside to this is, that you can't join your 0.0 corp/alliance activities for \~1day until you can jumpclone back.
---
You can do abyss in 0.0 aswell; just use the filaments in a safe system with eyes - use a JF service to get filaments to you /loot back to Jita.
---
Usually it's the easiest to just train up an alpha clone for highsec activities and if you want to do more skillpoint heavy-activities there aswell, upgrade it to Omega.
---
You need more reason to kick over sandcastles, but also some mechanics restricting how easily big blobs can kick them over and how many they can build, because otherwise what happens is that the blobs kick over everyone else's sandcastles and drop their own all over space. It needs to be difficult to maintain control over large parts of the cluster, and to deploy hammer fleets around quickly.
---
This means a big nerf to cyno transport, it means capitals shouldn't be allowed to take Ansiblex gates, and it means there should be a significant cost (in time and effort, more than ISK, since the blobs have infinite ISK) to owning large numbers of structures.
---
Stops the mwds being so effective, reduces turning circle etc. Sure, could just disable all prop mods when adc is active similar effect and prevents rolling holes
---
This needs to go viral
---
So mean... :(``
---
:D :D :D
---
where to begin with that. Logins are down  So CCP had to unfuck there shit. Perfect intel should not be a thing but neither should no intel .  Dont know how many peeps are going to be coming back after the whole we dont givea shit if you dont like the changes attitude from CCP anyway
---
I'm sure nullsec won't be dead, there will be plenty of fights, and people that krab afk will surely die!
---
The only issue is a ‘forward operating fortizar’ would be in competition with the defending group’s setup. 
---
Might make for some more meaningful fights though.
---
The thing about giving into this mass retard exodus is that it now encourages the same group to do the same exact thing, every time a change comes their way that they don't like.  
---
It literally validated unsubscribing as an effective method for getting CCP to do what they want, whether or not it's good for the game.  
---
Like blackout or not, it's irrelevant. Any momentum CCP were trying to stir up by making bold, aggressive moves to improve the game has been completely washed away. At this point they are legitimately crippled by years of bad game design choices and have essentially no way out.
---
I can only speak for my own wormhole experiences but we are probably wardecced for something like 2 or 3 weeks out of the years. So it is a complete non-issue.
---
He is not a nobody he is a ceo and a elite  fc for the welp squad which anyone can join and be an fc in day 1.
---
Highsec exist...
---
I hope the decline leads to a sort of spaghettification of the game at large. And maybe, just maybe, all the players can be sucked into the black hole too.
---
Tuesday realistically as it will take them most of Monday to move back from hi-sec.
---
Well because realistically speaking there is no way to catch the little bugger. If nullsec dwellers are making 10 fold the amount of isk per hour they currently making you'd have huge amount of  players log in and be in those standing fleets or if there is a minimum 15sec warp fatigue and no cloak you'd be surprised how eager those  nullsec dwellers are in defending their own space.
---
Neither are as fun as sitting in a little skipper in NullSec and letting people blow you up.
---
You poor bastard, you need to get you another even if it costs every other ship you own.
---
Your gameplay style hasn't been magically eliminated from the game
---
You can mine as you were before, but clearly aren't interested because of the greater risk attached. You could try and mitigate those risks by using scouts or having response fleets. You could also mine in low or high sec if you want no/reduced risk. 
---
But no, there is a sense of entitlement among miners, that they should have access to high end mining while under more or less zero risk.
---
It is what it is, the carebear accounts add up to way more than the players who want a healthy pvp based game. But the game's been in a steady decline for sometime now and business as usual is going to end up with Grinding Online going out of business eventually.
---
Just sad that snigg has fallen so low. It was fun to fight you guys in the past, now it's just like shooting retarded fish in a barrel.
---
They could start with actually trying to fix the game, implementing a retarded idea pushed by selfish interests is not that.
---
If we don't get another crucible patch soon the layoffs that caused crucible the first time will start again.
---
HAHHA LET THEM ALL ROT IN HELLLLL
---
things do need a reset basically. Trouble is CCP is more interested in milking the player base they have left at this point for daddy.
---
I was really hoping CCP had the balls to actually start reformatting the map with Trig/Drifter lore stuff...
---
It's the serengetti, the pvpers are the lions and the carebears are the gazelle. Sometimes  the lion makes a kill and eats, and sometimes the gazelle gets away. The circle of life.
---
I heard some other Goons say it was Russians
---
The CSM told CCP that bringing the Rorq out of the POS was one of the worst things that could be done, and by all accounts, the first iteration by Fozzie was even worse than what we got. Player reps, who had every reason to benefit from the Rorq, told CCP is was a bad idea, so this idea that CSM serve their own alliances is frankly just bulllshit and needs to be put to rest.
---
Sir the krabs that have no PvP modules fit  that have braved the depths of space are the true heroes of eve online. You risk averse PvP cowards are a cancer that must be destroyed at all cost. Adapt or die............................................................................bitch
---
Well... Characters are for free, getting in most alliances is easy... There is worse ISK/hr-jobs in EVE ;)
---
Reinstall should fix it
---
Why, you didn't.
---
On your point of the ganking mechanism, I agree. I have been saying that for years and it just now seems to be taking effect. If you discourage new players to grow and make it too hard then eventually the game will die out because there will be more outflow of players than inflow. And the whole “adapt or die” or “get gud” saying is all jokes until you get a situation like this one where ccp is bending over backwards and spreading cheeks by all of a sudden bringing back local and introducing “industrial cynos.” Because the player count is all of a sudden low. It shows a lack of strength by ccp.
---
You wanna make this game survive? Make it easier for new players to play and grow. Yes, yes i know.. “when i started it was tough and i had to accept losses and man tf up” ... same here.. i remember loosing my retriever to Code ganks many times.. but guess what.. the 5 other players i was playing with quit because of it.. We all gotta adapt to a new reality that the game needs new blood.. I.e. new players... first and foremost.. and they have to keep playing. Give them a safe(r) place to be carebears in hisec. To grow big and feel tough. Then when they go to lowsec, nullsec, or wh space they get introduced to another level. But they need more incentives (in hisec) to feel like they can grow and develop and make mistakes without it costing them everything. They barely got something to begin with lol
---
The veteran players gotta look at the future and longevity of the game. Stop bitching about cyno changes and black outs and rorqual nerfs.. this game needs new blood in it and diverse groups. Otherwise it WILL become just another serenity and then poof.. gone.. by the way the player base is reacting (like whiny bitches i must add) to the recent changes that can be quite easily adapted to makes me believe for certain that this game wont survive much longer. Which is sad.  The veteran players should be the adults and be willing to take hits for the game and give the new players a easier time and faster way to grow. Otherwise the veteran players will eventually die out and with barely any new player retention... done and gone eve online. 
---
And the black out was the best thing ccp ever did for the health of the game. Its the best thing that combated the botting ratters that stay hours on end just grinding combat sites. For example, I’ve been in GOTG for some time and when RR came it was absolutely clear that these boys were heavy on the bots (seen it myself and took screenshots and sent to ccp multiple times).  Now that I’m hunting them in their space they are barely active (due to blackout). Im pretty sure when Monday comes. It will be back to business as usual .
---
in my opinion lowsec specifically FW lowsec is the most fun place to be right now, it has a decent concentration of players and there is constant fighting at every ship level from frigates to capitals.
---
the age of the little guy has started
---
With their infrastructure the blocs should have been able to adapt immediately. They chose not to.
---
Its simple, stop giving olmeca whatever he wants
---
&gt;Its more efficient to just go mine in low, WH or highsec. Which is basically what we saw.
---
Agreed
---
&gt; They would need to get rid of local everywhere, heavily nerf Concord and significantly nerf WH space before anybody is going to bother with defense fleets for miners.
---
Not necessarily, typically alliances have standing fleets. Like I will usually hang out there and come to people's help when there are no fleets up. This is something groups already do. Especially if a Rorqual is on the line, that standing fleet will absolutely jump FAXs and carriers in to save it. 
---
Secondly, it doesn't have to result in nerfing everything else to make it worth. With the isk sink/faucets more balanced it, that would give a lot more room for increasing rewards in null to make it worth defending. 
---
&gt;How much time do you spend mining a week?
---
When I started in early 2015 that's all I really did up until late 2016. Every 2 years or so I change my focus. 2017-2019 was Lowsec PvP, now it is Null sov warfare. But I probably spend an hour a week mining currently.
---
&gt; they're too chicken shit to even bother playing.
---
why would you participate in content where the risk/reward balance is so retarded high sec is literally better isk/hour and lower risk?
---
You could try making something non-Eve related so you can get better/kinder criticism. Other Eve players are sort of (definitely) cunts. 
---
 Honestly looks like a lot of work and I think you've got something going here. Have you tried doing Warhammer minis?
---
lol how fucking disconnected are you?
---
I do different things. What sucks is whenever I roam each "different path" is 40 jumps through systems with fuck all in them.
---
I find all PVE in EVE so stagnant and boring I'd rather mine my ear canal with an icepick.
---
I mean honestly then stop trying to catch them if it's so bad. You just saw what happened when the game tried to force people who don't want to fight to maybe fight, they quit. So instead of that, go find people who want to fight and fight them, or find a way to make the ratters want to fight instead of making them. Because as you just saw, they'll just leave.
---
Best post you made all week.
---
This isn't a DM but nice try with the shitty excuse for not actually having an original thought.
---
Seeing that you've ignored most of my post, I'll only respond to two things.
---
&gt;The whole point of a sandbox is do what the hell you want and or do what the hell you can. 
---
Agreed. But that also means that I am more than allowed to hunt you for an hour and wreck your ships if I want it too. If you don't want me to do that, you're basically telling me I can not do what I want in the sandbox. In other words: You are contradicting yourself by calling someone's play style stupid yet you get triggered if these people speak up about their way of playing.
---
Further more, let me respond to the next thing you say:
---
&gt;Why not? PVPers aren't or wouldn't be the only customers since customers are the ultimate point of PVE. 
---
You are correct that they aren't the only customers out there. But they do represent a significant group of buyers that regularly needs to buy new ships and modules. Especially when we look at the more expensive ships like Muninns, Eagles but also interdictors and interceptors. Mind you, these are not the sole ships carrying that value or the market, but there absolutely is a massive effect on your income when things die.
---
The other day NC. lost a sizable Leshak fleet. In order to rebuild that, the materials shot up in price by marketeers who want to profit from that. As a result, you gathering materials will also earn a significant increase of income for a while. But once ships don't die, people don't buy.
---
Myself I rarely lose ships in fleets. As such, I barely need to make any effort to keep fighting because it's too easy to replace them. But now imagine thousands of people in that situation.
---
&gt; No one has removed bots. No one CAN remove bots. NPCs are bots. They just happen to be controlled by CCP. 
---
This is so dumb I am not even going into it. Automated gameplay needs to be curbed to a minimum and can not be an excuse to allow other changes that make your life easier. It is irrelevant what CCP controls, that is not what we refer to.
---
Wormhole corps almost all have their structures on an alt corp for exactly this reason, so you can't be wardecced. I'm surprised if nullsec corps don't do that too.
---
there were pos towers long before outposts.
---
Simple farmers would certainly like this idea, lol
---
39 alts  equals fuck ton of plex to buy or  39 accounts to sub. Seem to forget CCP run a business and the numbers dont support continuing this expirement
---
This is an absolute minimum level of sanity. It's not really even a 'compromise', it's still 95% of the way to the free intel krabbers' end of the spectrum.
---
They should have buffed the reward with blackout.
---
Never fit true T1 modules. They’re (almost?) always worse than the meta4 modules with the same or lower fit requirements. Like the ‘accommodation’ report the guy below suggested. To find a meta4 version of a T1, show info on it and look at the variations. For easy comparison to see what’s best, hit compare at the bottom of the variations window tab.
---
The reward I get from pvp is knowing that they are salty and crying over the loss of their ship. As well as knowing they will have to krab to make the isk back after buying a new one. Which can get dull at times.
---
Dude....when is the last time you've seen the sun? A game that has you this anxious to be AFK is not conducive to being a parent/pet owner/significant other/ happy human. My recommendation is to begin to not care about your ships and those delicious numbers going up up up. You'll lose everyone physically around you for the sake of voices and pixels on a screen. Yeah, Eve people are real people, but your dog is far more real and definitely more important.
---
The reduced passive resistances on the ADC are probably meant to be the tradeoff, maybe they are to good.
---
It doesn't matter how much brain you have, if the ratter sees you enter their system and presses 'warp to structure' 3 seconds before you even load system, you have zero chance of catching him.
---
The game is really simple.  the hard part is finding something to do that is enjoyable and then finding other people to do it with.
---
has to be done in a way that doesnt make industry Aids.
---
Lol... I’ll be fine... just trying to make conversation
---
They are a problem because whole generation of new players is put a gameplay loop where you constatnly farm to progress and progress to farm faster. And as a logical conclusion PVP is an activity that obstructs your progress. So people join the environment aka nullsec blobs where they can afk farm their character up  using almost decade old, endless content or mining in  perfect safety with out of game intel tools.  Will you ever try to fly ships you are skipping with injectors? Doubdt it. Why should you learn to fit and fly what you skilled when you could be half way farming your next skill injector? Why should you go and try PVP when lost isk=lost sp? 
---
CCP basically built in opportunity cost as SP loss in every vessel ingame.
---
Just look what happened when CCP tried to take steps to combat botting and inflation. Endless tantrum and hurt feefees by people thrown from their small hamster wheels, deprived of their free intel and safety with no other gameplay experience or ingame skill.
---
You don’t need a Freeport to drop your shit into any citadel. Find the closest empty cit, drop off everything except your ship and fit, then find some locals to fight and go down in a blaze of glory. Once dead, asset safety the shit you dropped off.
---
there are counters to fighters and bombers. HAWs are still problematic tho (or even long range gun tracking titans).
---
But what would that solve? What do you hope to accomplish with such a feature? My paranoia tells me that you just want raiding out of wormholes to be more convenient, but I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you are trying to address a glaring issue.
---
10x the profit? Are you nuts? Everybody and their brother already has a Titan or two. Rorquals and Carriers are out there AFK mining and ratting Billions of ISK per hour. And you think they deserve MORE money?
---
Null care bears won't defend their own space unless they can Cyno in a thousand Capitals in 6 seconds. That's why there's so many tears over the Cyno changes, b/c it means the Cyno ships will die faster and it'll prevent them from bringing in Trillions of ISK to the field. No, they don't need more money. They need to suck it up, like they pretend to tell everyone living in High Sec.
---
"Oh, you cowards in High Sec relying on Concord to ~~protect you~~ avenge you after you're dead. You should be cool like us, and have a Bot that immediately initiates warp to your Citadel as soon as a strange name enters Local"
---
I would argue that asset safety is what breaks the game, not citadels on themselves.
---
That's just bullshit if you read past CSM minutes, and you should be ashamed of yourself for blaming Goons - or any large bloc CSM rep - for the course Eve has taken since 2016. CCP did this themselves and many times were told by the very Goons you disparage that these were bad ideas.
---
Oh look, it's your pants.
---
So... they can't be fueled if they're low power?
---
I'm not super familiar with managing a citadel (never owned or anchored one) but don't you have to be able to dock to deliver fuel/put it in the fuel bay hangar?
---
When the twiddle waddles down to a twig can you really say you've done the jig?
---
Uhhu, so to counter the fact that invulns and other active resistance increasing mods are switched off, the ADC gets a slight resist bonus. Not enough to completely make up for the invuln fields etc.. But enough to balance the fact that active resistance enhancers are turned off
---
YAS LET THIS PIECE OF SHIT BURN TO THE GROUND, FUCK THIS GAME OMG.
---
aww kitties! So cute :)
---
Amarr and Caldari are very farmer heavy. This is kinda complicated because there are alot of folks NOT currently in FW that were in recent history and still live around FW and influence it without being part of it. Minmatar has some ok groups that pvp alot. They probably dont want to spend time floating around beacons and just hold a few systems. Galmil is probably the strongest and most organized militia of the four as far as pvp strength goes. And they are actively pushing the caldari back now after they allowed their tier to tank to cash out on LP. Galmil also probably has the strongest relationships to allies of the four.
---
Eve needs a new culture of players. Namely loud and obnoxious teenagers.
---
Its not necessarily about encouraging a nomadic lifestyle, its about NOT encouraging the biggest alliance in the game to cram into a small space.
---
Alliances should be made to expand, not necessarily move altogether
---
Eww
---
I cant speak for everyone but for me thats not true, I am not a machine that wants to do nothing but the most efficient way of gaining isk. In my corp we also do different stuff. Invasions for one arent even remotely efficient when it comes to isk, invasions are just to have fun with your friends in a fleet.  We also do pvp sometimes, so I dont think your argument holds up there.
---
There is no "their" way. It's balanced or not. You shouldn't be able require imbalance and bitch when you don't get it. You know they have been catering to you for years, and now when the number of abusers has grown large enough, you can ask for imbalance and get it since the game depends on it. Very immoral of you, and horrendously managed by CCP.
---
Going onto the Eve sub is sort of like going onto Bronies. Like, wow, this is cringe as shit but man these little dudes sure are INTO it.
---
Oh god you are such a fuckin piece of shit, mate. Not your fault of course ccp need your money, enjoy the fuckin android games.
---
Pity he didn't spend more time with him.
---
Fair - that is a lot of stuff that the delay would help with.
---
https://images.app.goo.gl/wsDe5JGjvcEmoMH17
---
Images of bots queuing as they return to their isk making activities.
---
Yeah, I've never been a fan of what this has done to industry.  The whole "choose what type of production your station is decent at" concept leads to too much structure spam and added tedium.
---
There are a lot of things that need to be addressed in the big picture.
---
sigh... the point is that highsec numbers did not fall as much as everywhere else.
---
Lmao stay mad
---
Fixing the ability to see ratting and mining stats doesn't benefit anyone but those looking for risk-free PvE.
---
Yeah that's not the point?  I'm not saying specifically nerf near2 or whatever, just that this does nothing to impact them.
---
Imagine your only source of content being rando pve fit krab ship.
---
Where's the part about abandoning all you know and love?
---
Lol would do nothing, you underestimate the carebears.
---
Yes I remember all the null blocs just screaming to change all the stuff that benefited them for years and let them have unassailable wealth...
---
Oh wait
---
Holy shit, you really take yourself seriously.
---
If ya don’t like it ya know what you can do bro, nobody is forcing you to hand over cash for something you don’t like 👍
---
I remember getting ganked on undock in a fight up in vale of the silent.lost like 15 ships, but it was a blast.
---
I puked in my mouth.
---
 **Local scanning structure** sounds like a good idea at least to try and then get data on it.
---
 **Pinpoint scanner structure** I would add a requirement for fuel, and the structure should use a lot of fuel, requiring a re-fuel maybe ever 48 hours or so.  Another option would be to make the pulse RNG and by constellation.  Maybe once every month to three months, cloaks won't work for up to an hour or even longer but it's part of the environment, not a structure and totally RNG.
---
The ones that shoot men in red
---
Yes. Uninstall Eve.
---
T3Cs are used plenty, and are quite strong, particularly the loki. The problem is moreso an oversupply of parts, not an underutilization.
---
Thats very easy to say when you can just order CCP do what you want. It is really you who sould stay unsubbed since you are not liking it.
---
So the positions are very different here, but of course this is inconvenient to you.
---
&gt;pretending that they ever stopped
---
lol.
---
With blackout it’s not if but when you got dropped. So ratting in a Super was still fine under an umbrella but it had real impact on subcap ratting.
---
&gt; Everyone argues that EVE is a sandbox, but at the same time, certain players want a certain playstyle to dominate and don't care if that makes others leave. "Unsub you noob" they say - without realising that they are pushing "their content" out of the game.
---
I'm honestly kind of shocked how prevalent this attitude actually is, not just in EVE, but PVP centric sandboxes in general.
---
DUDE, DID YOU EDIT THIS IN FUCKING WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER?!
---
You can drop off stuff without having to dock currently.  All CCP would have to do is allow access to the fuel bay.
---
&gt; For us to put them in a position where they can't try to fix the game in it's current state is upsetting 
---
We **want** them to fix the game, but to do it they need to actually fix the problems- which will require them to a*ctually spend some money on dev time to fix them...*
---
Flipping switches on and off and calling it "chaos" isn't helpful.  
---
Local in null has never been the problem.  
---
Citadel spam is a problem, lack of incentive for null groups to fight is a problem, supers and titans becoming the de-facto best ratting ships is a problem, roarquals bloating the mineral economy is a problem, skill injectors are a problem.  
---
They **could** fix these problems, but they'd have to spend some money and dev time to do it, (or in the case of skill injectors, lose some money). Instead they embarked on a half-brained attempt to put a band-aid on the problems by doing minimum-effort things like turning off local.
---
Stop trying to blame players for a problem CCP caused, and that CCP should be the ones to fix.
---
&gt;it did reduce the inflation we see today.
---
how did it reduce inflation? i mean BC went down in price from 80mil to 50mil. and everything else that capsuleers need for day to day life went down in price over last years
---
with a single exception of PLEX, which IRL term i would describe as "Picaso painting doubled in price, hurry up central bank we have hyper inflation here!"
---
PS: everytime when people cry about deflation i say this. the one industry where deflation is common place is the most innovative one of all. the IT. how much does you pc from 2000 cost in todays dollars? but how far did the industry evolve in last 20 years?
---
My recommendation is to join a smaller corp. They are less likely to be war decced and as a bonus are often a  more close knit community.
---
I’m loving it bud, will resub all my accounts again tomorrow! The game I enjoy playing will return, it’s called consumer power! You are just mad, it’s normal, next you will try to bargain, and when that’s done you will come to accept things how they are, it’s ok don’t fight it 🤣🤣
---
This is a reminder that Eve's UI is utter shit.
---
so so funny project much? your heads so far up your own ass. 
---
you couldn't even answer the questions.
---
Unless you are planning to bot do not bother.
---
Put down your keyboard and walk away. This community is toxic as shit, find a better game. 
---
Also fuck you.
---
&gt; TLDR it's the cap meta that killed BS and BC fleets.
---
More like it's the Mach nerf that killed BS doctrines. I was there in Hakonen in the summer of 2017 helping keep Goons from killing Horde Machs. Then CCP took away a low slot because reddit was all "Machs OP, Machs boring."
---
The whole nerf/buff cycle in games is cancer.
---
We all know minmitar ships are trash anyway. :)
---
sad to see your idea of "small gang pvp" is to just gank defenseless pve ships. so elite.
---
Jump clones
---
Go back and look at the minutes and stop making yourself look bad. CCP made the choices, and the CSM, en masse, gave them warnings.
---
Doesn't something like 85% of the player base pretty much never leave high sec anyway?
---
How do you nerf an out of game tool?
---
If a "specialist" ship requires so much investment into covering it's easily exploited weaknesses, it's better to just run with the "jack of all trades" so you can reship the dedicated support into mainline ships and end up with a stronger fleet overall that's also easier to FC/keep stocked/for members to skill into.
---
When you start throwing up from the chemotherapy you don't stop treatment. You still have fucking cancer.
---
nullbitch apologist is what you are
---
[deleted]
---
So now we've resorted to name calling without checking the FACTS. I'm done.
---
DON'T DO IT. DON'T DO IT. DON'T DO IT. Do you have family? DON'T DO IT. Do you have a lover? DON'T DO IT.  
---
This game has a culture of "you must play around the clock as soon as you get home from work, your dog doesn't need walking, YOUR TEAM NEEDS YOU." You need multiple profiles and you need to burn your PC to keep up. The game has dopamine releasing incentives to keep you coming back and playing until 5am when you have to get up at 7am. Go on a date? Better endlessly scroll through r/Eve to make sure you don't fall behind. Better have your discord pinging you around the clock with other people throwing their lives away for numbers and pixels. 
---
Please find something better. Life is short.
---
Ahh for the good old days.
---
What kind of fucking name is "Smoke?"
---
Are you a stoner or a dog named Smoky?
---
Of course you do. You are the traditionally immoral player. You want what is good for you and it never occurs that it might be bad for the game.
---
Why should I bargain? I'm correct from both a moral and balance standpoint.
---
&gt;Yeah 3-4B/hr once or twice a week, maybe a total of 8B a week. You need 4 dreads on grid to make that isk/hr plus maybe a rorq, probably around 3.5B a piece. So you are placing 15-20B on grid. 
---
Risk/reward? I have to put 20 bill on the field in hopes of making 300m/h super ratting. The isk you can make in a wormhole is fucking stupid by comparison. Not to mention the safey that comes with it.
---
Here's the spring update to nerf fax
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pobbb9/spring-balance-update-incoming
---
Insurance, carriers, supers and rorquals all targeted in the same update. It didn't blink into existence that next month; months of development went into formulating these nerfs. The design direction and goal is reducing safety and faucet/economy and has been for quite some time.
---
The fact that complete and total asset safety and other dumb stuff happened in eve doesn't refute the development direction.
---
For the record, I've liked the idea of constellation based local since it was proposed. But I completely disagree with your ideology. Creation and Destruction are two forces eternally struggling against each other to maintain a balance. Too much of one or the other causes a deteriorating state. The intrinsic problem is that creation has always been seen as 'good' and destruction has always been seen as 'bad'. No one wants to be on the receiving end of destruction. This leads to a risk adverse mind set to avoid losing everything. And because this is a game, people can just quit instead of sitting there losing everything.
---
&gt;Stop trying to come up with ways to hurt ratters for ratting, work on ways to convince them to pvp instead.
---
ding ding ding, we have a winner.
---
if you want people to do x instead of y, make x a better use of their time than y.
---
making y shit means players leave, making x more worth while means people do x instead.
---
&gt; Rorquals and Carriers are out there AFK mining and ratting Billions of ISK per hour.
---
ಠ_ಠ  K.
---
Listening to the big alliances (with their good lobbyists) only brought the game down. Titans online is no good game.
---
T2O all the time. CCP didn't learn anything.
---
CSM looked good on the paper - in reality it was truely a Big Alliances lobbying game.
---
Loggin in felt never that worthless.
---
You shouldn’t bargain, you should quit if you feel so strongly! Vote with your wallet, you are so moral, I suggest you take a stand, stop playing and biomass! Can I have your stuff though?
---
It would be ok if this mobility for carriers was their speciality but they combat abilities were not higher than those of subcapitals.
---
But since capitals and in this context especially FAXs are way stronger and only have the drawback of on-grid mobility...
---
It is safe only if enough people work on to make it safe. It is funny how people cry constantly that they cannot surprise some pve guy and kill him, cause they got reported from far away.
---
The problem is much more the blue donuts. But seriously, why would people wan't to keep enemies near themself? Nowdays there are zones, where you probably get fight.
---
&gt; They have to learn that first, but they have to be willing.
---
its not 2013 anymore.
---
&gt; They just keep not fucking listening at all.
---
&gt; I've seen so many great ideas on this sub on how to fix these issues ignored, none of it all that difficult
---
You are describing removing local. It was talked about on forums for ages, it wasnt that difficult to do. They *did* listen and made a change many people had been asking for. It might not have been the change you were asking for, but every big change like that is contentious. They are doing exactly what you are asking, making changes people have been asking for. Not all of those changes will work out, most ideas people have sound great but are actually awful. If you want CCP to make more changes you need to be prepared for some of those changes to not work out
---
What 10x anything? I don't even know what that means. And yea, surprise, people want to defend their space and make sure they win, not engage in some kind of honor duel. And to be honest, the people we're talking about aren't a threat to the space. None of these hunters are going to hurt any structure or sov, they just want to gank people who aren't intending to fight back. So I'm going to ignore them until they leave. If I fight them, they'll just come back.
---
Imagine if there were an iskmaking method where you could PvP in order to earn money. 
---
There's only one way around the "isk versus content" debate, and it's to find a way to integrate them so they're no longer entirely competing goals.
---
The biggest issue is CCP are looking for quick fixes to a very complex problem.  Essentially they need to stop rolling out yet more features and actually look at what they have and fix a massive chunk of it:
---
* Missions need a massive overhaul - refresh them, move them into something like the abyssal framework, make them interesting but not stupidly dangerous.
---
* Anomolies need reworking - ditch mining anoms totally and move totally to refinery moon mining, move ice to planet mining.
---
* High Sec ganking needs addressing so its only exceptional cargo's that make it worth doing
---
* Cloaking desperately need some balancing that allows active gameplay to remain roughly as is but inactive camping to be less
---
* New players need a safe and simple introduction to the game.  At the moment they bombarded with every choice they can make in game and then they have the arsehole element of the community screwing them over to add to their issues and it is scaring them off
---
* Rorq mining needs to be totally removed - one of the worst ideas every brought in
---
* Capital and Super PVE should be removed for current PVE maybe create a new "cap anoms" if people insist on using them
---
* Capital and Super PVP needs to be addressed and proper roles embedded for each class - and get rid of the stupid 1000km+ engagement range for carriers/supers
---
* Titans need to be a dedicated role in combat but excessive numbers become detrimental
---
* Mega-alliances need to be discouraged, the main reason nullsec is so stagnant is that the mega-alliances dominate and new entities simply cannot compete
---
* Structures need a massive overhaul, especially the rig system.  Limits should be placed on number deployed per system/constellation
---
* Structure deployment should be tied to sov ownership with new "Forward Operating Bases" taking on the role of aggressive structure deployment
---
* Corporate and alliance membership management needs a massive overhaul
---
* Personal and corporate hangers and asset management in general need overhauling badly
---
* Corp and Alliance security, eg BPs, structure gunning, needs looking at.  I want to allow corp members to use the corp assets but with the massive risk of some asshat stealing everything
---
* the list goes on.....
---
pretty much this
---
Here's a solution.
---
Change free SP so the effectiveness of Free SP is affected by the training multiplier of the skill, bracketed into x3's.
---
Skills with an x1 training time multiplier receive free SP at 1/(roundup(1/3)) = 100% effectiveness, this is things like light missiles, capacitor management, sharpshooter.
---
Skills with an X6 training time multiplier receive free SP at  1/(roundup(6/3)) = 50% effectiveness, this is something like, Logistics ships.
---
Skills with X14 training multiplier receive free Sp at 1/(roundup(14/3)) = 20% effectiveness, titans and capital industrial ship go here.
---
&gt;This is a point I'm increasingly hammering on in my push for a total PvE system revamp.
---
I think PI-ifying all mineral related content would be a good move. Mining asteroids is too passive, too slow and too inviting to scale up with multiboxing to stop people just botting it up instead of actually mining.
---
So rather than automated mining (via bots) being a case of breaking the rules, make it the new norm. Hire/build NPC mining fleets (like those in some highsec belts) which are set up similarly to PI. But of course, these are assets in space, and therefore need defending from attackers - but in a similar way, you can venture into enemy space and attack their mining fleets in kind.
---
The AI mining logic already exists in the game (they'll warp off to safes and what not) so they won't be entirely clueless, but nothing a dedicated attacker won't be able to hunt down. Evasive enough for (player) backup to arrive, at least.
---
It's a big change, but it seems the players who mine/pve the most, also try to automate it the most. So why not actually do that, while providing content at the same time?
---
Ns has just become boring. Structures are too hard to bash and have to many limitations. Asset safety makes even trying to destroy a POS pointless. It's impossible to unseat any major coalition. Cap umbrellas make living in null safer than mining in jita as you can at least get suicide ganked there.     
---
Null is most of the systems in the game and it's badly broken. Lot of stuff needs to change.
---
Plenty of ways:
---
* Blackout did
---
* Constellation / regional chat would
---
* Delaying local by a few minutes would
---
* Removing names and just showing total people in system would
---
I'm not specifically saying any of these but something to limit the usefulness
---
They should nerf the ranges on munins tbh.  The ships are too light on grid for the amount of output and survivability they provide.
---
You can assume that all you like.
---
There isn't an infinite galaxy out there. I can't tell if you just are Grr gooning or if you *want* the Imperium to just conquer the galaxy? What issue do you think this magic bullet will solve?
---
As opposed to feeding kills to those looking for risk free kills? 
---
Why shouldn't you have to actually put effort into finding people to kill? Having them handed to you on a platter as you complain about "perfect intel" is hypocritical.
---
Make pay to win great again. And yes dont forget the bots :)) what a joke.
---
Yeah thats a pretty good solution.
---
Yeah, no you won't.
---
Seriously you think only those would rage? Some people play and pay for this game more then a decade. Most of them work hard, to earn what they have. And then one they all of it is gone for "fun". It is nothing about safe pve. 
---
Nothing will be fixed, until people willing to join to the bigger force. And why they would like to be on the wrong side of a dick?
---
This is not a family member or a friend who runs a company that we support.  This is a company that we pay for a product for.  This company has had the ear of our player representatives for years.  They have known what we are asking for and what we want, and they STILL refuse to do what the players think is good for the game and decide to just push through with their own series of changes all the time.  I certainly don't think that players are the end all be all game designers, but it's time they start to listen and stop trying to destroy communities that play this game.  It's pretty sad when a CSM member pretty publicly states that he only plays this game for the people and not the game.  We have a systemic game play design problem, because the game play in this game is not why 90% of the players stay here.
---
Simple question: why do people (not bots) do PvE if not for money to PvP?
---
&gt;Undock, get out, find some targets and start shooting. Larger alliances/coalitions, please do your part and destroy this blue donut. Make enemies again, bring back the wars and bring back the content this game needs to survive.
---
Next time Goons move north, join them with an alt and understand why no one is doing war, it's the most boring thing ever
---
Please tell me that's a parody account.
---
Yeah. We should loose those player, cause eve would be better with less players.
---
The people who will say "carebears will never pvp" are the same people shocked and amazed at the results of the blackout. I'm sure I trust their judgement. 
---
At this moment, I am a carebear because there is no war on and I'll be damned if I'm going to go out to someone else's ratting space and try to catch a ratter/miner "just cause it's fun!" 
---
And I've already said elsewhere, it makes more sense for me to ignore the hunters and dock up because otherwise it encourages the behavior. Right now there is no upside for me to do so.
---
can you people make up your fucking mind then? crabs are bad, crabs are good, bots are bad, bots are good. what the fuck do you even want? boo hoo, I can only play against basically an NPC because human players are too good at avoiding me. Tell me who's playing PvE then? because that does not sound like PvP in any shape or form...
---
because there's more to eve than pvping, and all of it requires isk.
---
I was merely pointing out the hypocrisy in complaining about too easy intel for risk-free kills when you would prefer risk-free PvE.
---
Yes I fucking do, and I'm the god damn Lord of Hillsbrad Fields.  Come at me horde fucker.
---
&gt; And I've already said elsewhere, it makes more sense for me to ignore the hunters and dock up because otherwise it encourages the behavior. Right now there is no upside for me to do so.
---
same. right now there's no reason to go and engage in pvp with in eve. which is obviously a huge fucking problem that nobody seems to want to admit or address.
---
In 2006 if you wanted to chat to your corp or alliance, you had to log in.
---
Now you just need a discord tab open.
---
Seeing your wallet tick up, buying new toys, shooting spaceships with lazors....
---
Exo and eisu are kindred spirit, losing freighters at silly times.
---
I (we) will wait until we are proven right again and again.
---
CCP seems to back down because of the indirect cost of krabs quitting and not because the result of BL is bad. It's telling that despite knowing this, you still want what you want.
---
yeah, but 40 people that contribute to stagnation, vs active pro-content players.
---
They will reimburse you for the lost training time, just include that request in your open ticket.
---
It's not just this, but CSM don't hide the topics they cover or goals, knowledge of any area of this games development or happenings. The narratives people try to push because their identity is wrapped up within is bonkers.
---
awesome, this shouldn't be possible
---
They do, but maximizing your PvE income means minimizing PvP exposure. (Intel channels, standing fleets, super umbrella, blue donuts and no-camping agreements, etc)
---
Eventually you reach a point where you're making amazing isk, *specifically because* there hasn't been a kill within 3 regions of you for 48 hours except the time you dropped smartbomb titans on a rifter.
---
Whatever dude you are the expert
---
The issue is they have no want to risk their ships. They are only worried about making isk. Eve is game where when you undock you are consenting to pvp. No matter where you are you are at risk of another player coming and knocking over your sand castle. One of the largest issues is the disparity in skill right now. 
---
Small hangers generally have a better understanding of pvp mechanics than your average null dev ratter. They ratter relies on their space being safe due to other people defending it. Though I think the cyno changes are a step in the right direction against mindless defense. 
---
My biggest issue is that people like to say eve is a social game and it is. But it’s getting lost in these mega corps/ alliances/ coalitions. Their main interaction between each other is accidentally warping into each other on an anom. 
---
Near2 is also a really big issue in my opinion and tools like it. It is a tool that makes it basically impossible to not know something is coming towards your ratter unless a wormhole pops up in your ratting system.
---
The problem isn't so much the specific ChAoS eRa changes.  It's that they were random changes that were not part of a larger coherent plan.
---
The lack of larger plan means they can't give anything in return for what they take away.  For example, the carrier changes that brought about fighters took some and gave some.
---
You can't do that sort of give-and-take by pulling a single random suggestion off r/Eve.  Especially because there's no single change that could actually fix the game.  They need to rework sov, citadels, and infinite scaling of Rorqals, and they really should be doing a larger design that fits those puzzle pieces together into a coherent "this is how people should be playing in null".
---
And that vision can't be something as supidly-short as "be dangerous".  It's what a krab does every day, what a hunter does every day, how do sov wars and battles actually happen, and so on.
---
Hilmar’s alt
---
Normal caps ehp is fine you can burn through that pretty fast, but supers should only be 2-3 times the ehp off there counter parts.
---
Why not just try it, instead of asking the question, which has been asked multiple times before.
---
Compared to you, yes.
---
Personally I find nothing wrong with HAW dreads, they are stuck in Siege and present a nice KM if killed, and more importantly have a limited range (out to about 60), but the long range fighter-bombers and similar doctrines, that have an engagement range of 200 to 300 km is the bane of battleships. They mostly can't lock that far, don't have the scan res to do anything to fighter-bombers before it's too late, and have to little EHP to survive them.
---
Piracy is a side effect of PVP for me :D
---
Some people like owning ships. Some people just like to build. Some people just like to explore. Some people, I know this sounds weird, don't like to PvE at all and just want to PvP. Why do people play games like Sim City or whatever and just build with no conflict. 
---
Also, a lot of these ships are effing expensive. My hangar of PvP ships is in the billions, not including the titan. I have a shield and armor fax. Different dreads. Logi, support, mainline ships(from frigates to battleships) inties, hictors, dictors. It adds up.
---
This is how you get things like power creep.
---
"Don't make X worse, make Y better. Never nerf anything, just buff everything!"
---
&gt; "just cause it's fun!"
---
Why don't you want to have fun?
---
Lol so much salt! Brilliant! You really are quite the snowflake, brilliant 🤣
---
But they all pretty much make a cycle of isk where they make more isk than they lose
---
I also recently lost a ship on a shopping trip, but I didn't leave null sec.
---
Our coalition allies have a dank market, ours....is ok. Actually, ours sucks. But theirs is only a few jumps away with jump bridges.
---
So I run over there and fit up a T1 hauler. I think I may have needed some small amount of minerals, so it wasn't so bad to have to use an item hauler instead of a kyros because none were on market.
---
I needed to make two trips, first was uneventful, but as I headed back, my main screen heated up, our fleet wasn't just humping gates, we found targets and were warping in. It was go time.
---
While we slipped in, popped some nerds, and slipped out again, I heard myself being locked and looked over at my other screen to see myself, sitting 10km off gate, with maybe 50 reds appearing on grid.
---
At least they caught me empty. Didn't want that T1 hauler anyway.
---
&gt; We also do pvp sometimes
---
Not blaming you.  But if this is the attitude of the average new player sticking around in Eve then Eve really IS dying.  You came in after this became the norm.
---
Eve was supposed to be the toughest game out there, (rock-paper-scissors)^3 or ^4.  But now log on, find some guides, join a big-bloc newbie corp, follow the skill plans and then "sometimes engage in PvP".  
---
Sure, that "sometimes" was in some big war.  But the big wars are over.  They will never happen in this Eve environment.  No one wants to fight when they know they can't win and even a lot of Goons don't fight except if they are either coerced or want to see what it looks like to shoot their shiny new toy.
---
FW is the only thing.
---
And only if you keep winning.
---
A krab quit and now calls other people salty. The projection.
---
No I mean like getting together, taking out a few caracels and looking for some content. 
---
I myself am not about PVP, I enjoy PVE more, I like to min-max and try out different fits and ships. However I can appreciate the occasional pvp fight. For me thats a good balance
---
When I first started EVE I was fascinated by the concept of stacking penalties.  It's a shame that diminishing returns isn't used to balance more parts of the game.
---
this
---
I found during blackout that a lot of ratters were smart and were on comms/standing fleet - made for some great fights. It really felt like people were rallying together to help their own, even the lowly Vexors and myrms. 
---
Now I feel everyone will dock up, with knowledge of what ship I’m in, quickly check zKill to get an idea of my fit or if I like to jump alts in, and then undock with EW, BCs and BSs to kill my Kiki. 
---
With the surprise granted by Blackout, they didn’t have time to do all of the above, though many responded well - rip my Legion the other day :(
---
CCP killed another playstyle
---
Selling single bookmarks for escalations
---
It was told to them, they didn't listen - as always.
---
The big picture for EVE is dark, finally
---
You have no clue do you? You are advocating for something that KILLED fights, all so you can go after PvE players that data has proven won't be there.
---
LESS ratters died under Blackout, but that is your solution? Just...wow
---
moving systems in battleships and battlecruisers is genuine aids
---
You couldn't even cope with the answer and just trying to avert the topic to your meaningless question. Guess you don't even know the history of CCP and the pile of failed projects such as DUST, Valkyrie and so on. But I am gonna go ahead and answer your pathetic little question so you can feel like you are not completely out of point.  
---
Permanently. It should never have ended. Instead CCP should have focused on highsec next and ways to make new players keep playing.
---
It's not that we're trying to disencourage people from PvEing, it's that we're trying to introduce reasonable risk to people living in nullsec. As long as local exists, risk for the vast majority of people living in nullsec is easily managable by simply being active at their keyboard.
---
It needs to be balanced and reworked so that there is more risk, and in turn, the rewards need to be tuned up. It shouldn't be the case that people can manage 20+ ratting alts without so much as a fear of getting ganked since they can warp out of an anom the instant a target enters local.
---
I wouldn't prefer risk free anything.
---
If I want to find who's ratting or mining. I have always had perfect intel for that. If I want to find who's come to my system uninvited (maybe to rat or mine, you never know) I should also be able to do that too, in terms of balance.
---
Having local and getting rid of the ability to see who's ratting or mining would be a step too far in favour of risk averse PvE. 
---
Blackout getting rid of local and still allowing people who rat or mine to be seen was a step too far in favour of risk averse "PvP". 
---
There needs to be a balance. PvE players dont play the game to feed kills 24/7,  hunters don't play to be stomped by response fleets 24/7. There must be enough risk and reward for both sides of the coin.
---
That is fine until they feel so entitled that they rave and rage at everything else.
---
Well, really there should be some battleships that are viable in numbers other than machs.  You want more rock-paper-scissors than just everyone in machs all the time.
---
&amp;?
---
Tbf even if caps were never fielded a munin fleet will vaporize a battleship fleet no issue
---
supercarrier and titan nerfs hurt you, please, biomass. You were losing a war you blobbed AND NEVER EVER EVER EVER COMMITED SUPERS OR TITANS cause raiden outnumbered you so badly and freaking destroyed your drake fleets with titans, you cried and won a war that way, you are the only entity in the game that has pushed for nerfs in active wars and got em. You then cried about casinos(all casinos not a single bad one and sites like evebet or eveopoker paid the price for no reason) cause you were so butthurt you got evicted from all those regions and to this day you cant get over it and call it "casino war".    
---
BPOs, plural?  
---
Also remedial/mittani/dbrb should have been banned from the game years ago, fofofofo/kys/i'm a jeep.
---
Fozzie gets told a lot of his ideas are game breaking. He never has and never will listen and just moves forward and ignores input until the community screams loud enough. It's a pattern with him and one that can't be ignored for the health of the game.
---
I remember when we'd provoke fights from TEST by bubbling the warp from their jump bridge to 6VDT station. We'd constantly catch people that didn't read intel and they'd either have to come out and force us off the bubble, or continue hemorrhaging ships.
---
Now? You can put an ansiblex on the same grid as a Keepstar, and good luck keeping a bubble alive on grid with a citadel. Residents can just ignore harassment.
---
To me it feels like that isnt specific to them then, as everyone seems to rave and rage when a change is being made that they dont like
---
yes because if you weren't then why would you do it at all?
---
if you're breaking even or making a loss - you're just wasting your time.
---
Fake news.  Nah maybe half but I doubt it is even that much.  Much of highsec are alts anyway.  Jita is ~ 825 normally it is ~ 1000-1200 I suspect that difference are alts not being logged in.
---
Again, why are you against the idea that BOTH parties shouldn't have ANY intel AT ALL ? Blackout only impacted PVErs gameplay while it reinforced PVPers gameplay.
---
You can try to defend the PVP gameplay as much as you can, as long as you don't see any problem on the fact that only PVPers had all the intel they need, everything else isn't relevant.
---
You are delusional if you think you CCP is ever going to touch local in anyway ever again.
---
No one wants to risk their ratting ship, because it's a ratting ship. It's not fit to fight back. People didn't undock with the intention to fight. They know it can happen, but if it does, whether they survive or not depends on the fleet response. 
---
My ratting ishtar or domi or whatever can't fight off a small gang. So I'm going to die unless I get help. And yes, the person who PvPs all the time has a much better understanding of PvP than someone who doesn't. Okay.
---
So again, yes undocking in space you agree PvP is possible, but if you're ratting, it is not desired and people will actively avoid it. That this shocks some people is weird.
---
wrong!
---
then get a better pc
---
Lol I didn’t quit, I kept my pvp account subbed, I played every day! I had fun but not as much fun as before blackout, you see I tried the gameplay, I didn’t like it but tried it, I prefer how it was, local, now that its coming back ccp will get much more real money from me because I will pay to play and I will play more hours, 
---
Why are you so offended by local? Why does it make you so upset? If you don’t like it just go, like the null players did, Unsub all your accounts but one like I did, grow some balls and don’t be a cuck all your days
---
I take it you have forgotten what it was like before the blackout. 
---
Ships still died, your argument is only for easy no risk hunting. Man up and grow a pair of capsules.
---
that's a risk you have to run.
---
nobody has to play eve. nerfing shit so it's worse is just a way to get people to play other games.
---
if you want people to play, you have to make it good - pve is already dogshit in eve, lets be honest. making it worse just makes it easier for people to fuck off to other games. especially when you haven't given them an alternative activity to do in eve instead.
---
They can't fix the game if whenever they try something a large part of the player base starts cancelling their subscriptions and stops logging in because their favorite things get nerfed back into not being overpowered. It's as simple as that.
---
Now to be fair, some of their recent decisions have not been very elegant solutions, in fact they were quite ham-fisted. Not so much because of the changes themselves, but more with regards to communicating the need for the changes and letting it sink in so the playerbase can understand the necessity behind them. It would built a little more consensus on the subject, although there are always people that will throw a tantrum no matter what you do.
---
As someone else said, null had local forever. But it didn't have the amount of citadels and capital ships we have now.
---
The combination of citadel mechanics with the pre-existing cynos has made the physical geography of the game largely irrelevant and exploiting geography is a huge deal in any kind of warfare. This is a big part of certain strategies and tactics being killed off over the years. Heck, alliances would go to war in subcaps and could force the enemy to surrender by hitting their miners and ratters long enough to make them run out of money for combat ships. Good luck with that now. The only similar thing we have is booshing bomber fleets and it becomes boring because it's a single fleet composition to counter a single thing that everyone does all the time. It's all about n+1 or hard counters nowadays.
---
But how could you try solving such issues?
---
Hire a military historian to help you copy how things work in real life and tell you how to make the battlefield more fluid, spread out and with more varied fleet compositions being necessary, instead of having 4000 people on the same grid every time in pretty much the same 5 types of ships (capitals, some BC/cruiser sized wing, a bomber wing, etc)
---
For example:
---
1. Rework citadel mechanics, make them easier to kill with capital ships, get rid of most functions on low power structures and nerf asset safety.
---
2. Turn capitals back into what they were, strategic assets  meant for territory capture (aka structure wars) and anti-capital platforms, not solo ratting ships, ships that apply perfectly to frigates without need for escorts (hello HAW guns) or ships that make other ships impossible to kill without (predictably) bringing a ton more bombers (hello FAX). 
---
3. Add an upkeep cost for supers. They are the equivalent of nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered platforms but have no periodic upkeep requirements whatsoever. "The power core for these massive ships has to be periodically replaced/taken out and refit/etc because of \[insert lore reasons\]". Similar to how a nuclear powered submarine works, they get taken into dry dock every now and then to have their reactors inspected, refit, replaced or decommissioned. Make it a flat tax, a fuel tax or a module/subsystem that decays over time, cannot be repaired, starts giving penalties after a certain amount of degradation and needs to be built from scratch to be replaced (material sink).
---
4. Let people extract their capital skills with a special, one-time extractor that is given to every player. This single extractor can only extract capital-related skills and creates an amount of injectors depending on the total SP extracted. These special injectors don't have any penalties, so that people who don't want to fly capitals and supers anymore can either redistribute their SP by reinjecting them, or sell them on the market for a nice profit.
---
5. Reintroduce the ability to disable station services but not with entosis links or timers. Let people roll in with a kitchen sink subcap gang of 50 or less, lock and just shoot them. This forces a reaction from the defenders and the more structures they have over a wider area, the smaller and faster ships they have to use in order to counter it. If they want to counter it by dropping caps on everything, they have to have a really low number of structures otherwise the interdicting subcap fleet can just get out and hit something else as soon as caps land. Give the defenders 3 distinct repair options: get some logi on it (puts a fleet on the field), deposit materials to help accelerate repairs (material sink), both of the above or do nothing (services repair slowly over time on their own).
---
6. Iterate on cynos. Find a balance between making logistics too hard and making travel too easy and in-game geography irrelevant. Spool up time, an inaccuracy factor depending on skills, range and mass going through the cyno (aka you don't land directly on the beacon anymore unless it's a single JF jumping or something, so you'll have to assemble your fleet before heading out). To compensate, make freighters and JFs proper ships with battleship-like agility and warp speeds, medium and high slots and enough PG/CPU to fit useful stuff. Give more agility and a higher warp speed to tech2 haulers (mainly DSTs, BRs are mostly fine already) so that they don't become totally obsolete when freighters and JFs get buffed. Congrats, you now have capable hauling ships for all size classes that don't have to rely exclusively on cynos to get things done, so you can make cynos a bit harder to use in order to make geography matter again.
---
7. Rework anoms and minerals to reduce endless farmability of space. It's completely counter-intuitive that the more you farm a place, the more benefits you get.
---
Points 1 through 6 make it harder to hold and lock down large expanses of territory and place down structures everywhere. But point 7 makes it necessary to spread out beyond your immediate area of complete safety and comfort, even if it is only for a krabbing deployment to a neighboring region that you'll have to do as a group. There's your incentive to play as a group, your risk and your conflict driver. Large groups will have to choose between spreading out in more fleet of smaller sizes or keep turtling (but in a much more confined space that cannot support them anymore), small groups get some room to split through the cracks and cause some damage. Even big groups could do the guerilla warfare/roaming strategy tbh. Puts the chaos creation in the hands of the players and it's much more organic and fun.
---
No, my argument is that we forgot how  broken local chat was when they moved it over to different chat servers. They hid this fault by just removing local in null but I promise when it comes back itll still be broken and not work as intended
---
The current situation reminds me of what happened 10 years ago when Freelancer mod makers with best of intent gave players the ability to fly battleships. 
---
Every mod patch soon began to alternate between battleships getting buffed or the fighters and bombers getting buffed and one would just dominate. The administrator realized that adding battleships had basically killed the game and turned it into battleshipfest, but the player base was so ingrained into them that removing them would cause the entire player base to quit. Eventually he pulled the plug on the server after players kept continuously bitching at him.
---
A similar analogy can now be drawn with Citadels. They had unintended consequences, but it's too late to get rid of them now. Maybe debuff them, but...
---
It’s an alliance in a video game. You seem the like the person that would purposely stop being friends with someone irl if they joined goons. 
---
Get a life kid.
---
How is wingspan doing these days in light of everything that's happening? Are you still playing?
---
You don't think it's a problem being able to spam limitless asshouses that cost as much as a faction BS and take a dread 5 cycles and a week to kill?
---
Can I have your stuff
---
OOF
---
You have endless sites in null with pretty much 100% safety with cap umbrellas.
---
There isn't unlimited site spawn in WHs.
---
If it's so easy/safe/lucrative as every nser claims, you'd think they'd be trying it out for themselves.
---
First get rid of place anywhere mechanic, either it gets get placed on a moon, planet, or at the sun, or it doesn't get placed at all.  Also only one thing can get placed, as you now have to think about what you actually need/want.  Is it a good moon to put down a refinery to frack it, and do we want an Athanor, or Tatara, or do we need more manufacturing capabilities,  do we need PI from that type of planet, then a customs office, or can we put down a Keepstar, or would a Fortizar be more practical.  Have the leaders and the logi guys make decisions about the structures they place down, how best to utilize the space, what is needed and what is necessary.
---
More decisions about how to use your space that also cuts down on the structure spam, because my next idea is going to give the logi guys an ulcer.  BRING BACK THE FUELED 36 HOUR REINFORCEMENT TIMER for structures.  Yes, like POS of old, a fueled reinforcement timer, and you only get one, that can get kited into a TZ favorable to the attackers, or have the fueler possibly screw up the fueling, so that it comes out of reinforcement where everybody has to alarm-clock for it.  With the current system there is no counter play for the attackers the structure comes out about the best time for the defenders ***every*** ***time.***  There is no way for the attackers to influence it in any way other than having a high level spy get burnt to change the time it exits.  I am tired of getting up at New Zealand prime time on a Wednesday, to bash some structure that the defenders don't care about defending, because of asset safety.
---
Total asset safety is the Devil.  Why fight over something when all your stuff is going to get moved to the closest low sec system anyway?  Ooh a 15% inconvenience fee how inconvenient.  50% drops as loot and to give those "winners of Eve" a bone the other 50% actually goes into asset safety, unless the structure gets un-anchored, only then do you get 100% asset safety.
---
That is how I would change structures.
---
It takes some time to learn but if you read and try new things you'll figure a lot out in your first month or so. Asking in this sub is a mistake though because there are a lot of dipshits who can't read and don't try new things and so are very grumpy with how their eve experience has been.
---
How about some of that old-school Nano that made roaming gangs fun, and made it so the blob wasn't all deciding..
---
Maybe as a module giving 50% less overall HP, and DPS, but boosts speeds massively, and grants bonuses to snake sets - LIKE IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN EVE WAS GREAT!
---
Didn't ignore. Time is precious. Dedicated as much time to you because I felt like it.
---
I didn't bitch about other peoples play style. I don't give a shit!
---
I DO dislike other people bitching about other people's playstyle and
---
I dislike EVEN MORE CCP stupidly LISTENING to other people bitching about other people's playstyle.
---
I don't give a shit if you're stupid enough to hunt me for an hour in a billion isk ship! If you think doing so makes sense or is fun, that's your right in the sandbox. Just I for one will be laughing my ass off whilst you do!
---
"Funny how? Funny like a clown?" Goodfelllas
---
YES! Funny EXACTLY like a clown!
---
Actually other people being fools AMUSES THE FUCK out of me! Both in game and IRL! Especially when I tell them to their face what they're doing and they still do it! 
---
At some point both in game and IRL I figured out since people are going to be damn fools regardless..I might as well ENJOY IT!
---
The only thing that sort of thing "triggers" in me is amused astonishment...actually now that I'm older it doesn't astonish me anymore although the amusement has increased enough to comp for the loss of astonishment.
---
Re Bots again
---
How is botting "making my life easier" since I don't? Don't give a shit about botting either that others do it or the interest in doing it myself.
---
Now I do give a shit that CCP fucked up one of my toys to an certain extent. I was fond of my VNI as it was. Still useful in other ways but as I've said before and I'll say FOREVER I will NEVER like ANY of my toys fucked with for ANY reason. EVER!
---
Like I said elsewhere. There was a particular high end car I was thinking of buying UNTIL I found out the manufacturer had AFTER PURCHASE remotely chip nerfed the damn thing! FUCK! THAT! Apparently that was in the equivalent of a EULA when the buyer bought the thing but as I said. FUCK! THAT!
---
Oh please. since you think it's so dumb..maybe you're more techy than even me but I doubt it.
---
Eve operates on repetitive movements over a limited field. The field will ALWAYS be limited by the screen. Always has. Always will. Even with primitive tech from 10 years ago it is possible to replicate repetitive movements over a limited field. Always has, always will be.
---
What to do what to do? Captcha maybe?
---
Captcha pisses people off AND some techies figured out how to make AI solve that shit 4-5 years ago. I checked. Captcha would lead to more quitting. Guaranteed.
---
Just 'cause you and CCP don't like it doesn't mean it isn't true.
---
Can't beat bots. Bots will adapt.
---
Can't beat botters. Botters will adapt.
---
It may not be true for you, but that is what CCP designed for players. Farm as much as you can, as fast as you can so you can buy them sweet injectors and farm faster.  Before you bought injectors, somebody directly gave CCP $$$ for extractors. This is a fucking mobile korean/chinese grind mmo feedback loop built without second thought into game that is all about steady progress and adaptation. It has artificially progressed game age about 5 years or more within months from introduction. 
---
For you as a new player, catchup mechanics are really nice. But the way they were introduced truly benefit only older and wealthier players and are detrimental to game long term health
---
Oh look another blackout post
---
CCP should probably develop a new game and gradually ramp down EVE. Have some cross migration of characters or something. 
---
The goal would be for existing EVE players to gradually shift to the newer game. Plus, get new players for the new game.
---
meh, ferox meta wasnt fun
---
Without playing, yes.
---
Remember that the Glassing of Tribute was followed by a massive propaganda war to either upplay or downplay the effects of said glassing. The real issue is the inability to do serious damage to a group due to effects like asset safety. This is why I wish there was at least a partial destruction of assets in a citadel upon its destruction, instead of 100% asset safety. I would perfer 100% destruction, but we'd never get that. Until a group can do serious harm to another group's super fleet, we will never get out of this rut.
---
Any increase in risk is going to met by an attempt to mitigate that risk. People will do whatever they can to avoid dying while making isk. Yes, the end result is not dying, ever. 
---
There seem to be two camps that kind of co-mingle. Ratters aren't dying, and ratters make too much isk. If ratters made less isk, but basically never died, are we ok with that? Or can ratters make billions but lose a ship every now and then? No one seems to have a hard amount of how much isk a ratter should make and how many losses are "acceptable". 
---
If you make it possible that I can be caught ratting even if I do everything correct, then nothing stops anyone from catching me today, tomorrow, the next day and the next.
---
Bye, can I have your stuff
---
I was in the Phreeze PL fleet when he took like 40 Hellcats into 300 drakes.  It was an absolute slaughter that I'll remember for the rest of my gaming days.
---
restart client
---
&gt;Also I think there should be a battleship sized logistics hull.
---
there is?
---
Yes but we already saw lots of people just stopped playing. The people left were smarter but some weren't (the KBs are littered with them) but also enough people quit that CCP had to bring it back.
---
They still pay the same amount to CCP, from a business standpoint your argument is mute
---
That's not how I have fun.
---
EVE has always been unforgiving. I remember messing up in a Ferox waaaay back in 2007. After losing that ship I literally had to borrow and claw back. 
---
I really jives when you don't have a lot of obligations and you are willing to swallow what CCP puts in your mouth.
---
But when you have responsibilities like - insert any functioning adult stuff - EVE's hardcore nature is its own worst enemy.  Most people WILL go " F' it! " if the ship they catered for the better half of a year suddenly blows up in their face.
---
I for one really like the idea of blackout but alas, I don't really play that much so who am I to say that is the solution? :-)
---
They are fine in a hundred man fleet scenario, not fine at any smaller scale.
---
A non-bling lif (2B) can tank 26k cold, a heated one can tank 38k. A blingier one can tank 40 cold and 70k heated. Subcaps are not breaking those.
---
Horde fucker. That's worse than sister fucker, right?
---
Ccp vould reduce size of high sec, remove incursions there, make it way lrss desirable  put some love to lowsec and some limited ressources for region it woukd be great, now it just bacj to krabland with few content wars per year
---
Trying to profit through PvP should always be sub par to prevent canabilization
---
Yup, subfolders exist within shared and personal folders and work like current folders :)
---
CCP as an organization is decrepit and completely out of touch with their own game. They did this to themselves over the course of three years by slowly driving away content creators/FCs, leaving the mess you have now.  If they truly cared or had any balls, they wouldn't have reverted the changes.  Expect to see an exodus of whatever remaining PvPers are left.  Enjoy Serenity 2.0 :joy:
---
You don't need reasonable risk if the stuff that the ratters/miners are producing is destroyed at a reasonable rate. If a miner is producing enough ore to make 10 ships in some amount of time but in that time 9 ships are destroyed then things are ok. If in that amount of time only 1 ship is destroyed then you have a problem. And it doesn't matter if those are miner ships or ships produced. As long as the net production is close to the net destruction things are ok.
---
You are going for the miner's ability to produce ships instead of going for the rate at which ships produced die. Killing the miner's ability to produce ships makes people quit because their investment is now dead. But getting more ships to die means that you have more active people out about and blowing up and being blown up.
---
Same, this flip flop can't be healthy to anyone.
---
A nestor is a battleship that can rep somewhat, talking about a battleship sized guardian.
---
Shit, u/falcon they're onto us.
---
Maybe they did so wherever they got the software from, but hardly where CCP might listen.
---
Except the damage is already done.
---
"somewhat"
---
Drakes and Canes, only meta worth reminiscing about
---
The only thing I would argue and agree with you is that we see the item( citadels) as an item that isn't well polished in its implementation.
---
What I would do with citadels themselves maybe would be change the cost of maintaining one, changing the materials required etc etc BUT....
---
You must not forget that CCP conceals it's weaknesses by hiding in plain sight and what people say about asset safety is basically this;
---
It doesn't matter what people will deploy..if it's worth the risk to get the loot, then destruction will ensure. In other words, having 5 cycles of something that is there to defend your hard earned assets is fair...not getting any of the loot because of space magic called asset safety doesn't. 
---
So imagine how much less destruction would occur if asset safety was implemented when you destroy a ship....
---
the problem with ccp is that they have neglected the destruction part of the game.
---
So you arent just ignorant. You are willingly ignorant choosing to overlook hard facts. If you had played at all, which it sounds like you dont because you're one of those "reeeeee blackout reeee give back local" you would know that it was actually hard to find bots during blackout.
---
If you want to trade bookmarks it will be a little bit more difficult, but you could do it by selling access to a shared folder containing the bookmark(s) you want to sell. You can provide specific access so that the buyer can copy the bookmark out of the folder.
---
There are other BS than Machs...
---
Yeah, &amp; there's no reward for the actual *pvp* part (technically you get a trivial LP bounty but it's almost nothing). You can make the most isk by *avoiding* fights and just afk farming undefended plexes. 
---
I'm thinking of something like a 'competitive dungeon' where there's a bunch of loot cans, and you and a bunch of other nerds compete to loot them as fast as possible, and you have the option of mugging another guy for his loot if you think you'd win. Or a "real fleet pvp plex" that rarely spawns but gives out a giant LP reward if you cap it - could be added to ihub bashes somehow. Or juicing up facwar LP awards for kills to roughly match the hull value of the destroyed ship (to prevent abuse while making it worth killing bigger ships).
---
I was talking raw ehp, not reping fax's should go back to the old carrier balance.
---
You can't be fucking serious
---
If you want to make null not stagnant. Dont change cynos dont remove local. Just bring structure timers down to 1 timer for fuled and no timers for low power. Everyone wants to smash their spaceships together, not alot of people want to orbit a station for one hour listen to people do dumb shit in mumble.
---
Life has been fantastic without Eve. I see no reason to come back to Hilmar's personal playground where he can take the toy truck I was playing with because he wants.
---
No shit the change is biased towards hunting. You make it sound like krabs haven't got it good with years of uncapped skill injectors, capital buffs, rorqs and citadel spam. CCP's gaping faucet of isk must be tightened one way or another, or else the economy will be even worse than serenity. They accomplished it with much less game mechanics than what we have here, and their botters have joined us.
---
Local hasn't even come back yet and chat's completley fuckered for me.
---
I d love if the concept of doctrines d get dropped and we d return to the very, very oldschool "bring a ship with THAT tank-type and at least THIS weapon-range". Its been more fun than the uniform "bootcamp online" we re playing for yrs now.
---
&gt; It shouldn't be the case that people can manage 20+ ratting alts without so much as a fear of getting ganked since they can warp out of an anom the instant a target enters local.
---
Sure okay.
---
&gt; You can make over double that doing highsec missions.
---
So why use the space you hold instead of doing highsec missions that's lower risk for higher reward? Why stay in null?
---
Yeah a balance is needed but i think no local is a over correction.
---
There are other BS than Machs...  
---
Machs were great because high warp speed, tank that doesn't need cap (void bombs from structures) and you had utility mids for ECM, combined with damage bonus.  
---
These days, the new battleships are HAW dreads without siege.
---
Strength in number as CCP envisioned, now that every null bloc is on the same side of this issue :)
---
Tie it to gate cloak and disable local view for the hunter while he does not appear in local, and it seems fair.
---
local wasn't a conflict generator anyway here some ideas  
---
remove asset safety  
---
make sov much easier to invade  
---
remove "structure attacked" and "sov entos" alert  
---
remove low fuel structure timer and the armor timer on every small structure +reduce the struct timer duration   
---
bring back automated moon mining  
---
probably need to do some other change, i think the biggest mistake of CCP was to release the blackout alone AND without increasing the reward soo if CCP make the NS more dangerous (and we need that) then they have to increase the reward but for that they have to "break" the umbrella meta before'  GL CCP
---
It's not so much that they would need buffing it's that the safer alternatives also need nerfing to stop a migration of the risk averse. Some people would accept a little less isk for less risk. The risk-reward tiers are broken across the whole game.
---
You must be on double secret probation.
---
Not efficient to shoot one guy with an entire fleet? Yeah I've actually seen that done quite well elsewhere in Sins of a Solar Empire.
---
The shield mechanics there were such that even when the shield is exhausted its damage deflection was applied against damage being dealt to armor. And the resistances scaled upwards based on number of ships shooting that one ship. One on one? Shield scaled up to 40% resistance or so. Small gang? 60%+ resistance in effect. Getting designated as primary by 300+ ships? 95%+ across the board resistance profile.
---
It didn't let \*small\* ships live too much longer but certainly made heavy cruisers and caps last amazingly long times under concentrated fire. They'd still die, but it took far longer than it would if you were working over at least a half dozen different targets to also force repairs to spread out in addition to lower max damage deflection.
---
That’s amazing!  So the acl on the shared folder controls the access to to all the subfolder?   I’m very excited for this feature!
---
Why won't they just undock in the cheapest possible ship with a single gun and pvp themselves to the keep their rat rank low?
---
You shouldn't be mining in null without protection? Move to hs if you want to be a care bear? There is nothing wrong with that, hundreds of HS corps.     
---
Null pays a lot more, it's supposed to be a lot more dangerous. Right now it's a joke. You are safer krabbing in your main umbrella systems with your capital alts than a newbro is mining veldspar in a venture in jita.
---
Maybe they shouldn't have fucked over the hardcore players so hard over the past decade, All ccp did for the longest time was cater to carebears and ignore and hurt solo/small group hardcore dedicated players.
---
aka They would of had a loyal group buying a massive amount of plex (pvpers) had they not went down the road they did sadly its ccps fault with the path they took long ago.
---
So much salt, did you even think about the changes before crying 'cause CCP removed your "Hop in a cloaky ship and get free kills" gameplay ? Do you think all these people that stopped playing are only little children crying and that you're the macho man hero of Eve ? Grow up a little.
---
Local obviously needs to be balanced, but not a blanket, random 1-week warning removal.
---
Cynos obviously need to be balanced, not a "please use only these 2 lines of ship almost no one use, else you cannot cyno, but covert cyno is fine".
---
Balance my dear, balance. Not the "hammer swing like a drunkard retarded manchild" CCP just dropped on Eve.
---
&gt;Any increase in risk is going to met by an attempt to mitigate that risk.
---
don't pretend you can't make things riskier
---
&gt;No one seems to have a hard amount of how much isk a ratter should make and how many losses are "acceptable".
---
double anom payouts, remove local
---
&gt; Assclapped vexors
---
What is my Assclapped thorax a joke to you?
---
Make it like bounties, bigger ship,  bigger change. Ratting in a carrier or something for hours won't be undone with a frigate one time.
---
This. Both sides were just too polarized. 
---
There is a middle ground that can be found. But CCP needs to do their due diligence and take their time with a solution. Maybe stop the monthly updates for 3-6 months and work non-stop at a better solution taking feedback from the last 2 months.
---
Completely destroying one type of gameplay that people have invested literal years in to developing, and spent who knows how much money on, was obviously a terrible idea. Hail Mary’s almost never work, so I’m not surprised this one didn’t either. 
---
Too many people have pointed out CCPs unwillingness to make deliberate attempts to make changes to the game and mechanics. They’re doing the quickest and sloppiest changes they can to try and get the biggest return they can. And unfortunately it reminds me of SWG in the last few years before it fails.
---
THIS is an underrated comment.  
---
IMO we do NOT need more tools to make the governing( is that an english word? Hm...) of player-groups of infinite sizes easier. We d need the opposite. Split all that giant groups( Yeah, not just Gewns, ALL of them) down into their corps. Make a Corp-boss a frikkin CORP-BOSS again and not just a muppet that an aloft alliance-leader talks through.
---
&gt;So why use the space you hold instead of doing highsec missions that's lower risk for higher reward? Why stay in null?
---
botting/mass multiboxing of ratters
---
I'm not really talking about the citadels that people actually use, though asset safety is a problem, I'm more talking about the infinite spammability of cits; they cost, in the grand scheme of things, almost nothing, require almost no effort to set up, and are extremely annoying to remove.
---
Many people PvE on one character in order to pay for the PvP habits of another. Your plan is a misguided idea and you should stop throwing shit at the wall hoping to see what sticks.
---
Yeah, you just added even more griefing and tediousness into Eve. I don't like timers, but you have groups on people just shitting on these structutres 24/7 because they don't have to come back later.
---
Larger fleets don't care about local structures, you have to consider they're spotted as soon as they undock.
---
Lol, why is that dude so mad?
---
Once I put the first coat of paint on it I may post a giveaway thread for it lol
---
I love how people are looking at this news. There is a large group of players in eve who LIKED mining and ratting in relative peace, who found it relaxing. When they started this blackout and cyno changes that made those tasks very stressful, to the point of being unenjoyable (for some of us, obviously other people enjoyed the chaos). 
---
You cannot just sit here and tell us we are wrong for enjoying the game though and quitting when they take that enjoyment away. I personally said this would be what happens when the blackout first rolled out. I and many others just unsubbed and left. Numbers declined. Space was fine for a bit but rapidly went back to being dead.
---
From that prism I completely agree with you. The macro side of citadels should alter from its original design.
---
The access to the parent shared folder will also give access to all the subfolders. You can have multiple shared folders with different access setups  :)
---
You make a lot of assumptions, and logical aerobatics, to support your position. - Also not entirely sure why are throwing charts for January 2019 at me. What does that have to do with anything? Hard to take you seriously when you're chart-reading skills are so bad you don't even realize you are reading data from months before the blackout lol
---
&gt; To be fair bots do exist, and make around 50 mil an hour! WOW!! Although, the bots used to be in supers making 300 mil/hour 
---
Problem here is that super bots had no reason to stop. They kept on trucking as if nothing happened. - Blackout didn't affect supers, or other capitals, ratting under super-umbrellas, as they never really *needed* local for protection in the first place. The supercap umbrellas served that role just as well in the blackout as before it.
---
The bots that *did* have to pause for adjustments (or get sent to high-sec in the interim) were the subcap bots spread through the rest of null, and those were already returning to their null farming. Once the strategies were conceived, and the software adjusted, it was only a matter of time before it spread.
---
PVP should pay out isk. Say the amount of the KM. Insurance should be lowered as to allow people not to insurance fraud them.
---
True, some people left, there’s been a couple of exoduses since I start in 2005, but I also believe the drop in player count had to do with bots to quite a large extent. I’ve some alts in botting corps and not many were logging on. It will be interesting to see the player count come Monday, but I wish there was a way of knowing the real player count.
---
I’ve seen those but I’ve never played so I don’t have a lot of interest in them. I have made some dnd charters for friends and those turned out well, but I’m always open to suggestions!
---
Normal ships using cynos is no longer a thing. Cov ops ships or some type of industrial now. The days of copters hot dropping caps, or gate camping in a tanky bs just to drop a cap swarm on someone are over.
---
That’s excellent!  Thanks!
---
Yes and I mentioned that. If they want to have two accounts, they either have to pvp on the pve account or just accept the lowered payouts. Some people have a character with low sec status and can't enter highsec, so they make another character to do what they need to do there. Each of those accepts the limitations put on them.
---
So what does it say about battleships in general when the machariel was the only viable battleship doctrine?
---
Don't know the guys but sad none the less, thoughts to the family on such a terrible thing to happen &lt;3  
---
The industrial cyno is lit o7
---
&gt; Undock, get out, find some targets and start shooting. Larger alliances/coalitions, please do your part and destroy this blue donut. Make enemies again, bring back the wars and bring back the content this game needs to survive. 
---
Okay so when you put jump fatigue in the game groups like Rooks and Kings and PL could no longer suddenly drop all willy nilly.  So content dropped off, no one wants to travel to the ass end of nowhere if its going to take you a month to go somewhere else for 5 minutes of shooting.
---
When resources got evenly spread out across null a reason for conflict disappeared.  Even under economic agreements like BOTLORD not everyone was apart of it, and when opportunities to claim moons through thinly veiled pretext was required there was your content.
---
Now you only have a few ships that can light cynos, and that means less of a chance for escalation.  There is some more content lost.
---
There has been an idea floating around that small gangs and small alliances should be able to easily disrupt larger more organized groups.  That is not how things work.  Highly dedicated groups in the past had the organization and planning to drop and kill a target.  Groups now lack that and just demand content and kills without putting the work in.  Before Citadels there were still stations and POSes that allowed players to find safety.  Citadels now just have guns, but players still have to warp there to get safe.  Hitting a rorqual living under an umbrella and being surprised when an organized response shows up is not the fault of game design, its the fault of who ever failed to take that factor into account.
---
The "blue donut chokes all" is a myth.  It is almost as bad as "Null Sec is safe."  Null is only as safe as your alliance and line members can make it versus how hard everyone else tries to not make it safe.  Plenty of former BoB groups have and had blue standings to each other and still farmed each other for content.  Plenty of diplomatic agreements only prohibited attacking SOV.  For years Goons and PL saw eye to eye on these matters, and plenty of times large battles happened.
---
I think getting rid of whack a mole SOV and revitalizing low sec will reinvigorate the game.  I think those are two big floodgates of content waiting to break open.  I just don't think with the current team at CCP that we can get those gates open.
---
Agreed. Citadel spam made null to safe
---
But they didn't.
---
Yeah he means like chat windows literally taking a shit and that dreaded red text saying "Failed to connect to server" repeats over and over.
---
are you suffering from hypoxia your stupidity is shocking.  i'm starting to think an amoeba has more intelligence then you.
---
you stated eve is ccp cash cow but you fail to see that this version of the blackout was bleeding that cow. My hope is still that ccp makes changes to the game where intel work is balanced and not one sided. Also fun and enganging that inject growth hormones into said cow but that can only happen if we stop the bleeding.
---
If you like "mining and ratting in relative peace" go back to high sec.
---
Battleships should be the peak of subcap fleet pvp, they are fun to engage and be engaged in. If you commit to a grid you usually are committed. With hacs you just burn around with 2.5km/s and speed/sig tank everything while medium guns still have decent tracking, just feels like pussy mode.
---
I mean, it's a very rough draft of an idea that's never going to be implemented anyway.  It's mostly just an example of a hypothetical change that can be tuned to break Malcanis' law.
---
The other thing is avoiding the standing system under that proposal basically turns your structures into destructible npc stations, potentially with free tethers for your enemies, which should be pretty obviously unappealing if you are involved in any conflicts.
---
Oh you can make things riskier but people will still strive to eliminate the risk. You mention doing things to mitigate the risk and that's my point, if people do that and no one gets caught because they do all those things are you ok with that? 
---
Is the end goal a 0.0 of players who never get caught because they are the best at avoiding risk for PvE? It's just odd that people are demanding more risk but saying "Don't worry, you can eliminate that risk"
---
There's also Battletech minis!
---
Well your a pleasant one aren't you
---
no way to stop a 30,000 man alliance seeding enough men and materiel to evict anyone they please from a wormhole that has no asset safety?
---
sign me up.
---
Lmfao high-sec was even more dangerous to mine in then null. This is exactly the mindset for why the numbers are plummeting though, it's still the miners fault that they sent logging in anymore to be murdered left and right by "pro gankers" who won't do shit if there is a possibility of actual PVP.
---
Eve has been dying for a long time. and i think the death blow was being acquired by Pearl Abyss
---
Actually I live in this world of new Eden so yes my opinion is some capacity matters. Just cuz I don't live there currently dosent mean I haven't spent time there.
---
People have been "working" to protect EvE from CCP for years now. At some point enough is enough.
---
CCP also don't give a fuck anymore, when the October deal with  Pearl Abyss comes Hilmar will most likely get fired/leave with a fat paycheck, and we will most likely see more "restructuring" in the CCP ranks...
---
It’s perfect intel in the sense that it doesn’t matter what they’re in. The ratter or miner will dock up regardless. Cloaked and afk is more spooky to them than knowing it’s some fat battleship gating around. The problem is getting he engagement in the first place. They don’t need to know what ships u are in.
---
The logs show nothing.
---
Yeah.
---
Also no way of rolling shit chains.
---
They just want people not to log in.
---
What made me leave Eve was that i could never just log in and have fun it was always a multi hour affair and fun wasn't even always guaranteed
---
I LOVE LAMP
---
except for ships warping to your site cloaked, other than that they show nothing...
---
You are discounting the fact that his titan disconnected and when he logged in it was an auto-reinvite from his own account which had fleet boss. This guy runs titan ops every day. It was clearly a mistake, but it happens. 
---
Stop being dumb globby.
---
The hunters are just eating and eating and they think the prey is whats hurting the game. Dumb.
---
His alt had fleet boss and he was relogging after a dc.
---
Please this. 1-2 minutes would be fantastic. On a side note, I’ve been hearing players bring up a way this could be abused. They’d need to make it so u imprinted on a system, so like if u re-entered that system within 3 minutes of leaving it, your two mite timer would still be counting down. This would protect it so you could just jump back n forth and not show up. I personally don’t care either way but some krabs were worried about this.
---
Can someone help me with the source side?  What was posted by Olmeca?
---
&gt;You don't need reasonable risk
---
stopped reading there, nullsec should be dangerous, not safe.
---
I agree, perfect Intel should not exist. But in glad it's not one sided perfect Intel anymore. 
---
People do forget that hunters use perfect Intel like dotlan or in-game map to see where ADM are being raised or npc kills are to find where the crabs are. Both are non player tools used. 
---
At least with local I as a player have to report it to Intel channels given people a heads up that a small gang/etc is x amount of jumps from where they are. This even allows us to Inform our PvP oriented folks where you are so you get your good fights.
---
I love how you don't understand anything i said and just keep repeating your narrative. You are the one who is failing to see here. You are literally the most retarded person i have ever seen on this sub, and i see many retards here everyday. You failed to to come up with any arguments to what i said, everytime. I am not gonna bother with you anymore. You are a lost cause.
---
Change to Wormhole timer system.  A powered station then only has the initial vulnerability window, armor timer, and hull timer.  No more week-long grinds.  
---
Low power you blow through shield and armor in one timer, and 24 hours later is the hull timer.
---
When your alliance has reimbursement, there is almost little to no risk to the player.
---
Eve's cancer is overgrown, and the chemo hurts probably too much for the playerbase to allow it anymore.
---
&gt;auto-reinvite
---
that you have to accept you mongoloid
---
have you ever played eve online?
---
he is very clearly being dumb, and so are you for not knowing basic eve mechanics
---
well all you realy want is for krabs to not have a counter - thats just blackout lite
---
pvp should trim the weakest but a proper counter should be in place for it to be fun for both sides
---
tale one sides fun away and you get a dead game
---
CCP needs to rework asset safety on wormholes but yeah.. thats the idea..
---
That's not what I said, and trying to take what I said to the extreme only makes you look foolish.
---
EDIT: Also your grammar and spelling are terrible.
---
Thanks for the input, you’re the first toxic person I’ve seen.
---
&gt; Oh you can make things riskier but people will still strive to eliminate the risk. 
---
overall creating a net riskier environment
---
&gt;if people do that and no one gets caught because they do all those things are you ok with that?
---
but it wont, and if it does, then good because it's done through player interaction and not LOCAL CHAT BEING 24/7 perfect intel
---
Nah they don't *have* to give in to the demands of those customers who leave the game, they *want* to give in since they want the money of those people.
---
You can flag exempt before you undock...
---
Won't make a difference you will still get slaughtered by capitals, that's where the problem is for battleships.
---
What is invasion?
---
I was right again...who knew.
---
Think about why you want risk and then get back to me.
---
Yes, it's a parody account. As the name should tell you.
---
It has popped up for me before my client had loaded my ship/space and i’ve been in a warp tunnel. I was in a subcap.
---
Still lots of herons and ventures in jspace to hunt.
---
Insert that meme where the nullbloc groups shoot Eve and then complain asking why CCP killed Eve.
---
and the "chaos era" still continue without sacrificing local in k-space right..
---
Working as intended
---
Why not just go for activating local in systems where mil or indy index goes over 3 but reducing payouts / mineral spawns?
---
What, you mean 1-ship surpreme leader isn't fun?!  So ungrateful, CCP ain't got no time to balance more than one ship a year\~!
---
So 1 minute before you can tether once landing in range? I don't want to touch the maintenance costs because the little alliances. And maybe no tethering at all if in low power? Of you can't dock you can't tether so making ratting a more isk required thing to do "safely"?
---
I dunno just thinking out loud. It is a complex game with no perfect solution.
---
[https://gph.is/2cbpPfy](Omg, thank you.)
---
I only disagree with you when it comes to carebears trying to make eve less hostile to protect their style of play.
---
I dont mind industrialists whatsoever, but eve needs conflict to function.  Making nullsec space safe enough to constantly grind isk is good for those players but bad for the game
---
There were alpha maels, boosh rokhs, typhoons, nightmares...
---
No asset safety in l jspace is fine.
---
Yur idea is just pure garbage and shows the world how little you know about wormhole life
---
It's true. Few people were calling for the outright removal of local. And this fed into the niche elitist HTFU attitude of a few devs.
---
Many, many more predicted exactly what would happen. People left the game.
---
Good riddance and all that, sure. But you can hardly have a game with only 3 leet pvp players left. 
---
Instead, he about some nuanced, thought out design from CCP after listening to more than what they want to hear?
---
&gt; hese players who quit may never come back and if then, only some will. 
---
Same goes for PvP players that stop playing because they get "hurt" for PvP'ing. But in this case its adapt or die I guess.
---
Yes yes Vladimir undock the rolling alpha army we must spend an hour rolling this connection
---
eww.. a wormholer just got pissed
---
well OK citadels in null have proliferated. But so they did in wormholes ... maybe they could start by dissallowing any kind of structure WHs before they take their shots at null sec.
---
Which is still relatively irrelevant. It means more ambitious changes are unlikely to happen, and the game will more than likely stagnate even further and for a more significant period of time.
---
Rage, rage against the dying of the fight :-(
---
now its back to "infinitely generate isk while having perfect intel" 
---
definately balanced!
---
the truth is as i mentioned. the null blocs are organized enough to hurt CCP's bottom line if a change is made to the game they dont like. 
---
Eve online will continue its slow stagnation if the status quo remains. eve has been in constant decline for the last few years. 
---
CCP will not be able to act to remedy eve's issues because it by nature, must negatively effect null. and since null can and will use their organization to hurt CCP's financial interests. nothing can be done to address eve's issues.
---
sad state of affairs really. CCP cant save their product because some of their customers would rather the product go defunct than to suffer some inconvenience.
---
I can post it later but someone made a graph showing since olmeca got on csm and blackout started his post decreased.
---
and you fail at basic business understanding or you're just a stupid little troll so good day to you
---
That's a pretty big misunderstanding.  You do both, but avoid making a legitimate piece of gameplay complete ass to the point no one wants to do it.  It's particularly stupid if that piece of gameplay is something that supports people doing what you're trying to encourage them to do.
---
I was super pushing for it, but the logistics of getting a freighter in undetected was weighed against a guarantee kill. 
---
There was no way we would ever get it off, so we opted for the kill instead. 
---
We had a lot of fun with it and I'm really glad in how you guys handled it. Props to Exo for handing it with class.
---
I have yet to see the same level of eye gouging waterfall of tears that nullkrabs displayed during blackout from people who dislike the removal. It's just being disappointed that ease of hunter playstyle where you could achieve kills with a single account is being removed because you people feel entitled to be safe.
---
gotta go back to having 15 alts to stand a chance I guess
---
This is the bigger one. As much as people roll chains to hide from people, PVPers roll chains to LOOK for people. When I get a dead chain with terrible exits, and then I can't roll? Guess I'll log off? Seems pretty lame.
---
The Little Astra That Could in O3-4MN begs to differ. Bubble camps are churning out plenty of kills there despite having an ansiblex on grid with keep.
---
That said, yes. Citadels need a rework.
---
yes and there still is in many cases(just not in big fights). Im just hinting at the hipocrisy in "zippy"s statement.
---
Can confirm. Actually unsubbed due to cyno changes
---
But it takes them some time to change, and by that time I'll be gone...
---
If people want to play your way, they can by going to WH space. It is the least populated space simply because people don't like that playstyle, but yet ignorant folks such as yourself still believe that people not interested in your way of playing should be forced into it. Blackout happened, and CCP saw it was an unmitigated disaster. Yet here you are advocating for more.
---
So no, your opinion doesn't matter
---
Only way to change this is make pve and PvP interchangeable, so your basically pvping against NPCs as practise and isk.
---
That would mean stronger rats, and less off them. As you don't normally kill 28 bs, 14 bc, 4 cursiers 12 frigates. To 0 in a battle ship
---
Two months of fun for who?! Hunters or hunted??
---
This means that the various functions of refineries, indy complexes and citas have to merged someway. I'd opt for one structure per moon(M or L sized), maybe an additional refinery which can only be placed at the mining beacon of any give moon. XL like keepstars and Sotyos only go on planets, forcing an entety to choose what to plop down. FLEX can be place on any celestial body. (FLEX should inlude a forward operation base which can be deployed by corp who don't own the system as a bridge head.
---
I will type slow so that you can understand. You are you a moron. Your idea is terrible. Please stop posting.
---
not in the video, but I was in an apoc in the roua structure fight, got tackled by a goon when we were getting ready to pull out, then he got bombed by the structure
---
had a good laugh

Don’t gaslight me, bro. It’s not the players’ fault that CCP made bad decisions. Yeah, CCP is trying to make the game better, but they’re starting from a very warped mentality about what’s beneficial for the game.
---
Wow did big daddy ccp touch your the wrong way Mr nullbear?
---
There are far more than just local that makes whs different I'm not advocating for MY playstyle. Ifni was I would be advocating to remove gates moron. I'm asking why you hated blackout so much but it's clear your just a carebear who's interested in vni ratting till he can afford a Titan to afk rat in. People like you are the problem with this game not CCPs chaos.
---
I think fair and balanced would be if a neutral comes into local the sov holding players could type /destroy in the chat and the hunter just explodes. So the hunter is fucked but the krab is safe and had some action.
---
Sarcasm btw.
---
nice name
---
Stopped reading right there.
---
Not really, you make it out to seem like all the scanning is on one person. Join an active Corp.
---
But when you destroy blingy ships you get sweet faction loot. 😁
---
Okay, have a nice day.
---
bot online +10000
---
I'm not saying that's a bad idea overall but that doesn't really help the problem.  You need to get the losers back on the field, the winners already stay out.
---
Oh no, you cannot bother a multiple thousands people organization that set up a defensive position somewhere with your lone omega pilot, that must be so unbalanced...
---
Do you not see your argument of "bring friends to defend you" a little hypocritical there ? I would said bring friends to help you hunt.
---
Agreed. I'm not saying its a perfect fix, but if you can make money while doing PVP, I'm sure a lot more people will do it.
---
The farmers follow the tiers. If you want to shoot farmers, join the militia that's down on influence. Right now this would be Galente or Minmatar.
---
Have a high sec alt.
---
Yaaaaas
---
Many nullsec systems had outposts. Provi had like 1 every system. The citadel problem is that supers can dock there, piloted by people who crabbed in rorq or carriers for isk to inject skills and buy them in the first place, all while never having to park a permanent pilot in them at a POS.  
---
Citadels exacerbated the problem but they are not the cause.
---
....and? If you dc you automatically leave fleet and to rejoin after relogging even with the auto reinvite feature you need to accept said invite first.
---
Eve pve is set as single player content outside of incursions due to how payouts work. Mining, frigate abyss, incursions, and invasions are the only group pve that gives raw isk or blue loot.
---
Relog.
---
tbh i don't think CCP can afford in losing any more players
---
Yeah it could be as simple as the timer doest stop counting down, so if you jump back in it's still sees you as in system and reveals you any way.
---
&gt; carrots &gt; sticks
---
Maybe so but when you're already giving people 100 slices of cake a day, it's going to take a lot of carrots, and maybe you should take away some of the cake.
---
In which organization did you see the leadership ask people to stop login in and unsub their accounts so they could force CCP to rollback the changes they just made ?
---
Ah yes, none. You saw Mittani on stream talking about burning highsec for the Drifter retardness which is his only way to negatively impact CCP. He would never ask people to unsub because he has no right to ask that.
---
And because you're biased you think every change should negatively impact nullsec player because they are dirty krab F1 pusher that doesn't deserve what they got. That's far from the truth and that's why you're mad.
---
You need to balance nullsec, not blanket nerf it. Make it riskier but more rewarding, put some limitations in some activities (rorqual multiboxing, mass cyno ships, etc...) without completing fucking hammering it like they did with the cyno changes.
---
If your idea of balance is for CCP to actually say "FUCK YOU BITCH" to every nullsec player so the 0.2% of the playerbase can hunt in peace, well you just saw what happened.
---
Stop crying on Reddit (you're not alone, there are on both side mind you) and start being useful.
---
It did this to me when I resubbed a bit back for some reason it resets after downtime. A sync issue or something just sent a ticket in.
---
I mean they are always doing that.
---
So more isk isn't really enabling much of anything.
---
&gt; made a significant change to structure timers.
---
Yes please.
---
hmm I think defensive position needs to be.... you know.... defended?  And groups who communicate and  [Defend](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78268011/)  their shit actually succeed at repelling offender.
---
In that Stratios I killed 3 Vexors, you know why? because they were people who didn't talk to anyone to join the corp, they simply put ESI into third party website, get "verified" within hours and join right away to print isk in highsec with red 0 number.
---
I did die when they set up a trap for me and had a fleet ready
---
And the loot, not just the LP.
---
CCP is as usually lissens to the wrong people.
---
Today:
---
1. Complain about very expensive ships to get them "nerfed" to the point where you have to be protected by a super umbrella to take them out.
---
2. complain that everyone join a alliance with super umbrella....
---
Remember to encourage change. Above all else please give CCP the benefit of the doubt for that. Regardless of outcome and regardless of the details, they chose to take the risk and try to improve things. Better to try and fail than to never make an attempt at all.
---
What killed the BS meta is the Mass Bomber epidemic.
---
thats a lot of words i didnt bother to read
---
Hi, I don't rat, I don't mine. At all. I have a titan. I have a  Super. But certainly, keep attacking what you do not know. 
---
CCP made a huge error with Blackout. They realized it to not have the desired effect and walked it back. But here you are wanting people to continue to unsubscribe from the game in droves. Why is that? What makes you this utterly stupid? Too much krabbing in wh's? WH space is a HUGE portion of krabbing in game, even with lower player counts and harder logistics. It is actually safer per capita than Delve, which is the most heavily defended and krabbed space in the game.  But sure, keep telling us all how you guys are the elite PvPers and we are the Nullbears. I always love a good laugh.
---
Is it because you are incapable? I'm sorry I didnt mean to offend if you have autism
---
The thing is, you can clearly see from the economic figures that nullsec ratting (with local) is too safe and too lucrative. So you absolutely do need to either make the reward lower or the risk higher - and making the reward lower doesn't make the game any more fun for anyone, so it seems obvious that it's the risk that needs to change.
---
Your proposal effectively reduces the reward, by requiring you to spend time doing other activities or accepting a lower payout.
---
It's also extremely gameable - just have out of corp alts that you can 'PVP' against to whatever the minimum level to maintain payouts is.
---
What we need is for PVE to be
---
- Engaging, and requiring the pilot's attention. This makes it more fun, and also harder to multibox or AFK. A simple adjustment to achieve that would be to make rats aggress drones and fighters, particularly if the main ship is out of their range.
---
- A source of PVP content. If you're out doing PVE then you should be a legitimate target for PVP, because that's the only way organic fights on anything below a strategic level happen. This means that PVE should lock you down (scramming rats, deadspace mechanics delaying warp, the same disruption you get for shooting a structure, bubbles in the site, whatever works) - but the same mechanics would lock down someone jumping you, so you'd have the chance to escalate on them.
---
- Runnable with a sensible PVP-capable fit. Why haven't the Sansha worked out that they need to fit a mod to close that resistance hole yet? You shouldn't be running sites with a single damage type, minimal tank fit, not only because it damages you if you get jumped, but because it's dumb that it's the most efficient approach.
---
Sleeper sites in wormhole space do this quite well, so they'd be a good template to start with.
---
Group PVE, like incursions or high tier wormhole sites, are also great because isn't playing together what a social game should be about?
---
Switch to what, genius.
---
Yet lack of reason to fight is often cited as a reason people leave. Give the ratters their local but give the fighters something to shoot. We all know what people SAY they will do without asset safety. Let’s see. If it ends up with a drastic reduction in structure usage, isn’t that what people said they also want?
---
I mean you just autistically screeched at me, thats about the crux of it
---
QQ
---
&gt; For us to put them in a position where they can't try to fix the game in it's current state is upsetting... If they do decide to make further changes please please work with them not against them.
---
I basically came in with the Blackout (coincidence), but it's not reasonable to expect people to keep playing when CCP makes the parts of the game they like unenjoyable.  While the game may have problems, there's enough going on that "fixing" part of the game for you has a very realistic possibility of "ruining" the game for someone else and the worst consequences of that are pretty obvious.  At the absolute least, if you don't want people to speak with their wallets you have to make "working with them" feel like a two-way street.
---
Local Idea: Fuck off
---
Throwing facts in your face isn't exactly artistically screeching lol
---
It's a bad idea because minerals are at the very core of almost everything players have to build. If NPC's can supply them you might as well seed everything directly from NPC's since you've effectively removed the changing market with the exception of a few things. That's not a case of "spodbrain", it's a case of not dumbing the game down even more. You have an ISD member explaining it just fine in the thread I'm not sure why you think this would be a good idea. There's a lot of other places you could implement isk sinks than at the very first step of the whole industry segment of the game.
---
What’s been done to help PvE players that’s hurt PvP? I’ve only barely ventured in to PvP so it’s likely I’m missing some context.
---
both!
---
the memory is starting to get more and more blurry
---
Years ago I posted about CCP painting themselves into a corner.  Their favoritism for a certain group of players chased all other groups off players away for a very long time and left CCP with essentially 1 specific group.  I said this meant the game would slowly coast through a long death because if they made any big changes they'd lose the only group they had left.  Well, you guys told me I was full of shit but here we are.
---
&gt;Throwing facts in your face isn't exactly artistically screeching lol
---
you're right, its not "artistic" its autistic
---
&gt; If ratters made less isk, but basically never died, are we ok with that?
---
Sure, you can go and rat in highsec for this experience. But it's important that there are PVE experiences that actually have risk of PVP - because how else do you get organic content? - and those have a high enough payout to attract some people to do them. And the higher the payout for the risk free site, the less possible that is.
---
&gt; If you make it possible that I can be caught ratting even if I do everything correct, then nothing stops anyone from catching me today, tomorrow, the next day and the next
---
You can be caught and still win the subsequent fight. Ever heard of baiting?
---
If it isn't possible to catch you if you play correctly, then soon enough everyone learns to play correctly, and nobody can ever be caught. We're pretty close to that situation with local chat, and it makes for a boring, bad game.
---
I totally agree but not by 'Chaos' that annoys people.           
---
Game should be fun not annoying.
---
That's so skilled, you used a cloaky Stratios to kill pve vexors. After 3 kills, they were mad and formed a fleet to gank you.
---
What did they do wrong then ? Not fit a triple tank from the start so they could live if the HYPOTETICAL random in a cloaky came and tackled them ? Nothing would have saved these vexors outside of a fleet ready to undock in the same system. That's also why people were docking before local was removed, they cannot fight you, why should they stay ? You want them to form a fleet to chase you, maybe ? You don't have that choice.
---
&gt; hmm I think defensive position needs to be.... you know.... defended? And groups who communicate and [Defend](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78268011/) their shit actually succeed at repelling offender. 
---
We call that the standing fleets and supercap umbrellas. But unless you're goons before cyno changes, nobody fit a cyno on pve vexors.
---
&gt;The downside to this is, that you can't join your 0.0 corp/alliance activities for \~1day until you can jumpclone back.
---
Set your home station in whatever system your null group lives.  Jumpclone out to high, when you're done deathclone back to null.
---
didn't you hear? Armor HACS, ARMOR hacs, ARRRRRMOR HACS!!!!!!!
---
If minmatar and gallente are more PvP focused, would I probably get more fights by joining amarr/caldari? Or is most of the stuff the former military are doing in gangs that I couldn't tangle with as a solo frigate?
---
Removal of Blackout.
---
how do I reset the chat window?  I had to reinstall Eve Online.  Now local and Corp chat (Center for Applied Science) tabs are empty.  The Rookie Help tab doesn't blink.  I assume that I accidentally deleted the settings folder.  I do see people in Rookie Help Chat talking.  I'm stumped.
---
I want fights. If I catch a farmer then fine, but what I'm really looking for are people to have good ol frigate 1v1s with.
---
No. this is a terrible idea and every way. Do not support terrible ideas.
---
But that really only makes it so PvE players don’t have to participate in PvP if they choose not to try and beat a BS in a Skiff..... If the BC wants to fight a Loki they’re still able to do so.
---
If you can't roll wormholes it will only be bubble fucked static chains, no dynamic movement in wormholes.
---
Yes, people roll connections for safety, but a lot of groups roll wormholes to roll into other groups.
---
If you ask me ratting in supers should not be a thing. That in itself is a huge problem.
---
Is it worth to skill up for FAX these days, but going through all "tiers" (so logi cruiser t1, logi cruiser t2, and finally to FAX)?
---
Well if you want to help CCP and ot hurt the ingame market, go do your part and buy PLEX to spend on SKINs (but make sure to activate them). CCP makes money off this and the economy remains untaintented.
---
Yea.  I just look at my PvP record and, to put it bluntly, it's not going to save me any time ratting.
---
Structure spam even just on its own merits is a huge problem. It takes such minimal effort to build and place a structure compared to the effort of destroying it. Most of those spammed structures don't have any assets in them anyway.
---
Every single large organization suggested to their people that if they unsubbed some alts and/or did not plex their farms they could effect ccp's bottom sub numbers enough to reverse the change. goons, NC, INIT, test all of them. 
---
they did. and it did.
---
that is the lesson here. 
---
that Null players will simply unsub their alts when a change is made they dont like. their leadership will endorse it and spread the message for others to do so. 
---
ccp will cave and the game will continue to stagnate and PCU's will continue to drop. 
---
but hey i could be wrong. the thousands of bots that return to EVE on monday could totally be healthy for the game, maybe i dont pretend to know everything.
---
ill repeat my statement because i feel its important.
---
CCP can no longer make changes in eve to save their game. full stop. 
---
their players wont let them.
---
CCP cant really fix making people want to fight each other, thats down to the players, any meddling is just going to rub people up the wrong way and cost them over time. Instead when big groups pussy out of fighting this subreddit should do what its best at and deride the other side so much they'd be too ashamed to back out of fights.
---
or maybe we should go and do more exercise instead of just banning cake?
---
another good wormhole change would be to add local "indefinitely" to shake things up as things are too stagnant there ofc
---
more isk = more options to have fun.
---
Gut artillery. It can still have the highest alpha, but not so damned much more.
---
Meanwhile, this enables fixing falloff-based guns like ACs and railguns.
---
PVPers also use local to LOOK for people and coerce people into fights but you guys seemed pretty against that
---
&gt; It is safe only if enough people work on to make it safe
---
This is absolutely not true of local, no player has to make any kind of effort to have a neutral appear in local.
---
&gt; No, asset safety in  jspace is fine. 
---
here you go buddy I fixed your mistake and added the comma you surely meant to place there. hope this helps.
---
Bots use lesser used systems so as to lessen wait time between anoms. This will not impact them as only 1 or 2 blues in that system will keep prices low in your model, giving them near free intel while helping them escape from hunters who don't have access to local.
---
So where are your bots you are trying to protect located?
---
I'm not advocating for blackout, I'm saying that was a way to do it, I'd much prefer some of the other ways I listed.
---
&gt; You could spam POS' the same they spam citadel's
---
No, you absolutely could not. You can't have more than one POS on the same grid, for a start. And POSs are far easier to destroy, if you're a big blob, than a citadel (although shooting down POSs is a pain for small groups, it is true).
---
The stagnation of null will eventually lead to the end of eve. That is bad for WHs as well. So the problem of null sec perfect Intel and perfect safety needs to be addressed. Your comment is very closed minded and shows a true lack of understanding of the game.
---
Fucking 15km
---
&gt;Botting meta is not efficient (low isk per hour); raising fixed cost will harm botting more so than players
---
it really won't.
---
literally people running accounts 23/7 are going to have fist fulls of isk to pay trivial isk bills.
---
people who aren't are either going to get a strained wallet or fucked by no local. congrats on another short sighted and idiotic idea.
---
Those were the good days.
---
Don't lie. Did you eat shit to an Arty cane while approaching it there after the video ended?
---
eve was never a pvp game, it has been a sandbox for the last 16 years.
---
I just unsubbed yesterday because I realized after 1.5 years of playing, Skilling into "better" ships wasn't actually bringing me any more fun. Trying to play my particular playstyle wasn't fun, and on top of that, I have been paying CCP about 20USD month for the privilege of playing a game that honestly wasn't bringing me any enjoyment.
---
People WANT to like EVE. I tried VERY VERY hard to like the game, to tell myself if I kept playing it would get better, I'd have more fun. But in this blob or be blobbed meta, there's no room for a casual 10 hr a week player to roam around lowsec and pirate, or make drugs in relative peace without constantly being evicted from my refinery.
---
Inb4 "Get gud", "adapt or die", or "find more friends to play with".
---
EVE 2 is long overdue. EVE 1 will die off eventually.  They can talk all they want about never making a sequel and continually "improving" EVE online but it's just not realistic.
---
I mean the changes they usually make have been marginally incremental. 
---
They need to bring some excitement back to large battles. They need to make players want to work together towards goals. 
---
Why don't they take some of that VR tech they've worked on for the 1st person shooter EvE Valkyrie tech and use it in EvE? Like, let players dock in carriers that are in fleet and let those players fly some fighters or something. Or let them man turrets on titans. Make it so a titan can fit a module that allows 5 or 6 players man turrets instead of a DD.
---
Guarantee you'll see more of these deployed for smaller gang stuff WITHOUT A DD. How fun would it be for a 20 person cruiser gang to be dropped on by one of these and try to fight off piloted fighters? 
---
Titans will see more realistic use instead of just standing by 99% of the time and then when they do drop on small gangs, they'll actually give the gangs something to fight...
---
How fun would that be?
---
What are the engine limitations that are holding Eve back, in your opinion?
---
I was expecting this: [https://youtu.be/WciZBu7U7io](https://youtu.be/WciZBu7U7io)
---
Not sure fixing unlimited resources would be viable. I suppose youd have the same issue with krabs quitting in droves because krabbing just “isn’t worth it anymore.”
---
Thank goodness. I was suspicious of the name but I wasn't sure.
---
Really nice video updooted
---
perfect intel is a dumb meme, stop using that. as for lack of understanding of the game doubt it friend theres little i havent done in this game, and i can guarentee you, local didnt change anything for the good and nor would it.   
---
actual problems like people being able to afk and have near2 ping them yes its an issue, no its not a local issue, its a chat logging issue, delay that to a point that it would be useless and thats that issue sorted.  
---
the cyno changes are shit because it fucks with more than just krabs, and is a blocker to the large scale fights y'know the ones that actually get the game publicity. the issue is people being able to drop supercapitals on everything that moves.  
---
 instead of nerfing huge swathes of the game they could just make it so supercapitals can only attack structures and other capitals, meaning if theyre tackled a subcap response fleet will have to come save them, which I'm sure we can both agree upon that, that is the goal here? actual fights? unless you are a supporter of the cyno changes because you want easy ganks, because as fun as that might be thats not healthy or balanced.
---
abyssal space is: risk 15 bil in ships and implants to make 50-75 mil. if you get unlucky with rooms you loose your 15 bil. if you make a single mistake, you loose your 15 bil.
---
But if they just keep doing the same thing....
---
&gt; We are entitled to safety because we built the safety
---
TIL players built local
---
They need DPS more than EHP I think... right now they trade a ton of mobility and take an order-of-magnitude reduction in tracking in exchange for a marginal increase in DPS over a HAC. The EHP isn't much of an advantage because HACs and T3s have way more ways to mitigate damage.
---
If they actually did significantly more DPS than cruiser hulls, there might be a reason to bring them to the field. Also, right now they need more support to apply their DPS than HACs do, so you might as well just switch to HACs, put those support ships in more DPS hulls, and come out ahead in damage.
---
So I can obviously only talk about my standpoint here but the problems are the players. You can't blame people for not being in space when doing so is most likely going to end in no fun content for them and losing isk in the process aswell. But when a 30 man fleet comes to shoot your stuff just to have a brawl freaking undock and have a fight. Noone reasonable tells you to go 20 vs 200 but running when you are 20 vs 30 is just being a pussy. Everyone complaints about not having content but when it is at their doorstep they don't undock. People don't want to have fights they just want to kill stuff and that is not going to change with any change CCP makes. The only thing that CAN change it are the players themselfs. 
---
Oh also yeah it did combat inflation because noone logged in...
---
REEEEE adapt or die...I guess.
---
lmao you do realize there are game mechanics retard that affect the sandbox in which way it tilts.
---
amen
---
BS EHP is fine, they need to do more damage.
---
That's my whole point. People want to introduce more risk while saying "don't worry, you can mitigate with skilled play". If that's the case, what's the point? 
---
So if you increase the risk and the payout, and everyone adapts to the risk so they don't lose ships anymore but now make more isk, how does that help? You just saw what happens when you add risk but don't add payout.
---
Centralize the meta around battleships. Looking back years ago battleships were extremely fun and seemed to be a catalyst for escalating content.
---
Problems now:
---
-current doctrines are so fast and nimble that they just run away from any fight that does not look like an easy win killing the chance of fights escalating.
---
-defaulting to dropping the “content-killer-I-win-super-blob.”
---
Currently BS are too susceptible to bombs and caps.
---
The big bad strong null bears couldn't adapt. So they did the next best thing. Cry
---
&gt; double anom payouts, remove local 
---
I would say it's a good idea, but doubling doesn't even offset it. Let's say you double the value of a haven, that goes from 30-35M to 60-70M, That's half an hour on average to clear the site with a myrm while being at much more risk than a wormhole that pay 400M for the same amount of time and 2 people if not using a herodread. 
---
See the point ? Nullsec is only viable isk-wise because of multiboxing and infinite respawn. You have to farm longer/add more chars but it comes with less risk.
---
Address the fucking multiboxing-able PvE, buff rewards, and you have way fewer problems of inflation and stuff. The risk is just another variable. But that will never be done because CCP needs money.
---
Yup. If anything they can get a little more action from mulitboxers as 500 plex is $20, the cost for a sub in game, vs $15 for paying for it outright.
---
The way I see it higher plex prices means more people are going to buy the $20 option and sell it vs Farming for multiple hours a day, seven days a week. Which in turn means more money for ccp
---
That's not a player problem. That's a CCP problem. Players don't undock because they don't feel the fight is worth it...
---
So, CCP needs to find a way to make those fights worth it... it's not the players fault they don't feel like some small gang fights are just boring and not worth their time/effort/ships...
---
1) Resource Scarcity (Number one conflict driver)
---
2) Resource Dynamics (The old moon system was fine if the moons could deplete and shuffle around the region.)
---
3) Imperfect Intel, and mechanics to govern the availability of information.
---
4) Short term (something relevant to do in a 2-4 hour period) and Long term objectives. (Something relevant in a 1-3 day period)
---
Most Large objectives are long term resulting in a hurry up and wait scenario, there are very few relevant "small objectives" overall the list of "impactful" things to do is very small and lacks depth.
---
5) Advantages for holding contiguous space. (Perhaps constellation based, perhaps cap related.) As it stands putting a flag up is not very exciting nor very advantageous, and often quite costly.
---
6) A Place for the crab-bear (High sec), a place for the non-crab-bear (Low - null), and sandbox opportunities to mold space to the needs of both. (Crab-bear, and PvP security guard ops)
---
7) Further Region differentiation. (Some regions are more attractive in different ways than others, this should be emphasized.)
---
8) Supers to null, or more ways to pin them in Low.
---
9) More ways to Harass, Subvert, Disable, or otherwise perform annoyance to existing infrastructure. That don't involve outright destruction. Things that disable, disrupt or reduce the flow of work, and require a response, a waiting period, or active action to remedy.
---
Cynos are fine, large organized groups should be able to support restrictions, and limitations. Smaller groups should weigh their options more carefully. (Stop trying to play the mmo by yourself or solve every problem with a capital drop. Can't escalate and too lazy to escalate are different complaints)
---
Perfect Intel like old local allows for pilots to be risk adverse, which results in stagnation, and non content.
---
Blackout local removes the option to be risk adverse and as such ships are lost, that would normally have been docked up. (hence the complaints)
---
If you don't want to travel for your kills you are missing out, and lazy, IMO.
---
RnK was pushed out of their nitch not by jump fatigue but by overwhelming number. The quality of their piloting, equipment, and tactics eventually couldn't overcome the blob. The success of 1 v X  breaks down at high values of X (The reason blob is used)
---
Blue Donut mentality pushes available targets further and further away from staging. Leaving room only for organized alliance extended ops, and casual smaller skirmish ops require more and more jumps to be fruitful.
---
then they'll get more isk, which will give them more options.

jesus grow up. they (ccp) ran their business into the ground. when hilmar announced sale to PA, that was the end, that so many of you refuse to acknowledge. If eve is going to be revived by anyone, it's not going to be the people who are leaving in a month, after having a decade+ to work on the game.  you guys are so naive, if you think hilmar and his team are acting in good faith towards the players right now... like it's just beyond me how foolish some of the expectation you guys have.  read the fucking writing on the wall, for fucks sake
---
You're telling me no one from your corp/alliance tries to help you?
---
no shit, game mechanics affect the sandbox?
---
who'd have thought?
---
Removal of null sec stations/Removal of blackout/Removal of offgrid links/Removal of passive moons/Current carriers/supers being useless in pvp and only good in pve/Lots of changes just cant get them all off my head right now.
---
Did u start playing in 2017 by any chance
---
With local back finally the newbros can take back Tribute, Syndicate and the drone regions from the horrible blobbers who have moved in recently.
---
People only like pretending Eve is a hardcore game. They turn into WoW players they make fun of real fuckin quick when they can't be assured total safety
---
Stop lying, Bruce.
---
Mining op is go.
---
lol have fun shooting rats
---
No they don't and they never will. Unless you kill any kind of logistics with it not even removing asset saftey will make people undock for a fight. You can't complain about not having content and then not taking content when its there thats just stupid. 
---
Also 20 vs 30 was just an example. It can be 50 vs 60 50 vs 70 100 vs 120 doesn't matter people dont undock if theres the slightest chance of them losing a fight.
---
let me check it out :)
---
hi, my myrmidon is tackled in an anomaly.
---
can you get here and kill who's attacking me in the next 60 seconds, cos if not then i may as well just open the market window and hit the multibuy button...
---
I don’t venture out into null. But it’s not PvP to pop a miner with a BS. It’s curb stomping. That’s not a fight. It’s a public beating. I get that most people who play games like that kind of thing. But, it’s not hurting PvP for those ships to run away. It’s just making it so the easy killmail isn’t easy anymore.
---
Or, you could become a better hunter.
---
Unless you're having fun in the process... Which is ostensibly the point of games. Eve can be so all consuming this point is sometimes lost.
---
Yep, but it's something. Better than nothing is what all entry level hunters should be crossing their fingers for at this point. Sad but true.
---
Thank you
---
Been adapting for 5 years but now its just pointless because there is no light at the end of the tunnel
---
Easy answer:  Pretty easy to play, just don't trust the tutorials (they aren't great).  Use Rookie Chat (it will be open when you start the game) and get into a player corporation as soon as possible.
---
How difficult to get *into* Eve...  there are only a few thousand people in the world who are actually into the game and we are a weird and deeply troubled bunch.  You'll know when you're into it.
---
&gt; people paid to live in null and not in wormholes
---
Removing local did not make null wormholes.
---
&gt; Psychologically, you need to let PVE prey feel safe
---
In nullsec? Supposedly the highest risk space? Why should you feel completely safe there?
---
&gt; to stop a migration of the risk averse
---
why?
---
your argument falls on its head like you as a child
---
it doesn't matter if you're having fun or not - if you're not making isk then at some point you'll run out of it and have to go and make some via your preferred method. making isk isn't optional, even if it's opening your irl wallet and buying plex.
---
Send an application to off-target
---
We are a Caldari FW corp pvp focused. 
---
come on a few fleets and see what you think.
---
Yeah, why does it bother people that krabs get to dictate balance that breaks the game? Let's think about it.
---
Won't disagree with the overall point, but I think it's range that is the issue, not overall dps, in a brawl at 0 you want battleships over HACs as it stands now. 
---
Problem it's just pointless to bring battleships, because they'll get dropped by doctrines that melt them at engagement ranges were battleships are utterly useless, and they are way to slow and sluggish to ever close range to get into useful engagement ranges.
---
Notes from an average normie in EVE , I played for a few months and EASILY the biggest turn off were gate campers in hisec that abused wardeccing... I can completely get behind getting ganked in null but getting dunked on coming from and going to jita was just some bs. That and the game is about crap when teaching mechanics... Coming from an avid tarkov player that's saying something. I'm sure I'm going to get downvoted into the depths of a blackhole but that's just my 2 cents.
---
No that’s not what I want at all, and as we all know there are plenty of counters that would still be in place if there was a delayed local. 
---
Counters are being discussed in other threads, such as structures, and I’ve voiced my support in these. 
---
As for taking one sides fun away, well..CCP have been pretty prolific taking away the fun from a lot of the pvp players, up until the Blackout.
---
I would agree to remove asset safety if everyone in PVP fights had their stuff in destructible stations in NULL. We cant have 1 of 2 group sitting in high sec completely safe and the other risking everything
---
if you're going to die instead of adapt, can you please die quietly?
---
dood!
---
I guess just enjoy being mad at everyone in literally everything thread here. My idea is awesome :D
---
&gt; Every single large organization suggested to their people that if they unsubbed some alts and/or did not plex their farms they could effect ccp's bottom sub numbers enough to reverse the change. goons, NC, INIT, test all of them. 
---
Citation needed. I know for a fact that it didn't happen in NC., and I'm pretty sure nowhere else.
---
&gt; that is the lesson here. 
---
The lesson is don't piss off a good portion of your playerbase with heavy-handed changes and start thinking about it a little, and start thinking long-term iteration, too.
---
&gt;that Null players will simply unsub their alts when a change is made they dont like. their leadership will endorse it and spread the message for others to do so.  
---
&gt;ccp will cave and the game will continue to stagnate and PCU's will continue to drop.
---
Let's say you remove concord in highsec. People will start ganking everyone. What do you think will happen ? Highsec people will unsub, forcing CCP to revert the changes.
---
There is no concertation needed here, and this blanket blackout was kind of the same thing as removing concord from HS. If you're mad at nullsec for this, you may want to trigger your neurons a little and think again.
---
&gt; but hey i could be wrong. the thousands of bots that return to EVE on monday could totally be healthy for the game, maybe i dont pretend to know everything. 
---
Here we go, the bot argument, as if 33% of Eve playerbase was made of bots.
---
You ever played any other MMO/Bottable game ? They never left, they're just gone somewhere else in New Eden. You cannot stop botting for long, as demonstrated in every MMO on the market.
---
&gt;ill repeat my statement because i feel its important.  
---
&gt;CCP can no longer make changes in eve to save their game. full stop.  
---
&gt;their players wont let them.
---
You know repeating false statement doesn't make them true.
---
CCP can and should make changes to Eve. CCP should think about the short and long term consequences of their changes before doing so. CCP should communicate about what they are trying to do with the game, and commit to it, not drop some random big changes and never iterate on it.
---
I feel the reason the numbers plummeted that fast is partly due to the abysmal communication CCP had on this occasion, too much uncertainty, not enough respect for players feedback, and changes were announced ONE GODDAMN week before. With all due respect, Falcon didn't help much either because people took his views as CCP's dogma instead of his own.
---
Change management is a real job, guys. And it's needed.
---
And CCP just had to come out hat in hand and say they were rolling back the blackout so can all the ratters please stop quitting. I'll let you guess who is more important to the CCP wallets.
---
There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with quietly unsubscribing from the game if you don't like to play it. You don't have to be held hostage by it, just move on. The problem is with an organized, disruptive effort by a significant portion of the remaining player base, threatening the entire revenue stream of the development company simply because *they don't like a change*. Not because "it's good for the game" or "it's bad for the game", but because they don't like it. The key words are organized and disruptive.
---
The problem is that we already taught botters they can easily park an alpha pod on a gate and control the dock-up function of the botting ratters. 
---
We will now require granular control of a local module (disabling temporary via entosis, permanent via shooting) in order to properly combat bots.
---
Then dont fly a myrm. Myrm is the optimal ship for ratting for example but if you are willing to sacrifice tics for a ship that can do PVP/PVE you win. You just have to think outside the box
---
See this is where you nullbears get it wrong. Yes c5 space can in theory have the best isck faucet in the game it also takes time and effort to set up. Takes alot more than undocking and warping to a haven. It's only safer because we take the precautions. You nullbears think your safe as long as no ones in local with you.
---
Ccp made an error yes I'm curious where exactly that error was as blackout as a whole isn't the issue it's how they pushed it. Local is to strong of an Intel tool for residents of NS. Simple as that. Yes there is less players but they are individually more active.
---
But sure make it seem like I'm here to scream for more blackout and unsubbing you've got some issue with reading comprehension maybe you should get back to grade school?
---
So I ask again in the clearest way possible to get a straight none insulting answer from you. WHY DO YOU HATE BLACKOUT? Cuz I simply don't understand why there was such an overreaction to it. It only changes weather you see a cloaky loki trying to kill you or not. Not weather he's actually there. I've talked to alot of cloaky camping supporters on this SR and most say the reason it's busted is local not the cloak... I think this proves otherwise.
---

---
Which, again, comes down to players not feeling it's worth losing their ships... which comes down to a CCP problem where they don't give people a reason to fight.
---
Simply showing up isn't always a reason to fight. 
---
Go ref a structure and see if they form the next day. Maybe CCP needs to get rid of certain structure timers and allows the gangs like this to put 30 min into bashing one in an attempt to get a fight out of it.
---
“Not far enough in the direction I want.” This is how every progress stops.
---
Breaking even is infinitely sustainable by definition if growth is not the goal. Otherwise I agree that with regard to isk generating activities, the point ia to be net even or positive assuming your isk generating activity isnt fun in and of itself but a means to facilitate fun positive activities.
---
I'm gonna have fun being able to pvp in an actually populated nullsec again and be able to bait out subcap response fleets again :) you have fun with your tears though :)
---
Because as a hunter who snags plenty of shit the barrier to entry to catch anyone other than complete fuckups is too high. It means we do shit with spys and multiple cynos and log off traps and super expensive fits and pods just to have a chance to catch something. 
---
Some poor guy who joined the game with the notion that they can just go out in their lone assault frigate and try to catch something will rarely even see a hostile ship. They won't see another person until the blob is on their head. That's bad gameplay because it means only really dedicated people get to play on the hunter side of things successfully and any moron can play on the prey item side and almost never lose. And guess what? That means most people end up in the big safe groups doing the safe activities where they are less likely to lose.
---
I can agree that ALL capitals apply damage way to well to sub caps. Cynos are a problem,but I don't think the cyno changes are the right changes. If you ask me cynos need a spool up timer. As far as the cyno changes be a blocker to large scale fights, I don't see that as the case. With a little prep it will it will still be easy to get on grid.
---
and what do i get by feeding bigger, more expensive ships with a longer payback time, to hunters instead of a myrm?
---
a bigger loss mail and... what?
---
I think he edited your dna via your mom with his huge drake cock
---
Don’t forget the absurd range.
---
Lol crying about losing offgrid links... might be why CCP ignores you
---
&gt; Removing local altogether was an extreme change, heavily biased towards one style of play: Hunting
---
Any good change has to be heavily biased towards hunting because the status quo is incredibly biased towards safe krabbing.
---
It’s not a matter of free intel. It’s the matter of perfect intel with no delay.
---
Balance is your opinion! I’m bored of this, find a safe place bro, and have the last word too I’m way too immoral for you 🤣
---
i need isk to do x, if i'm breaking even i'm never going to be able to do x because i'll never be accruing isk.
---
Dude....but...how on Earth did you know?!
---
Can’t speak to Carriers and Supers. Only ever seen the ones in Amarr. Blackout is not directly hurting PvP, just making it so PvE centric people (miners are my focus here) don’t have to spend most of their resources replacing 3 ships every day. 
---
When I do PvP which is admittedly infrequently, I look for a fight. I usually lose and pretty badly, but I’m hunting something that can fight back on an even footing. Not me and 8 others stomping a skiff into its asteroid. Not even alphaing at1 frig out on an explo run. I get that most people get off on being op and punishing another player for not being equally op. So, if by catering to PvE and hurting PvP you mean “I can’t smash the faces of weaklings with ease anymore”, then ok yeah I agree.
---
And again with the circles. It's riskier, unless it isn't and then it's good there's less risk because we used a third party tool instead of local! Yay!
---
I love that line of thinking "We'll do this thing, there is no way people will get around it, but if they do, good, we planned it that way"
---
I don't know either. All I know is I watched the numbers drop during blackout and CCP had to reverse course. I'm not a betting man, but I'm I would say it's pretty likely the drops were subs, not bots. Otherwise, why reverse course?
---
There are no targets or fights to get anymore. Miners are collateral damage because nobody undocks for a fight.
---
Thats what PVP has turned since stations were removed and citadels were introduced. Back in the day you would take your 3 dudes in nano ships and force the crab into actually undocking pvp ships by sitting on there station undock. They wouldnt use super to kill you because they couldnt have them docked so they didnt actually have them.
---
&gt; It means we do shit with spys and multiple cynos and log off traps and super expensive fits and pods just to have a chance to catch something.
---
I mean yes I did these things, that was the fun and the allure of it, blackout was lame because it was just rock up completely invisibly only show up once im ready to tackle the dude and by that point theres no fight no challenge its just an easy gank then off you fuck. no challenge no fun and no balance.
---
Guess who will quit anyway when pvp starts decreasing and nobody is buying shit anymore.
---
Yeah, exactly. For you, you generate isk to do something else. My statement was supposing the activity you do that isk isk generating is fun in and of itself. Thus if you are net isk even but net fun positive, then it is not a pointless activity. It's cool though, many people view eve as though their purpose was a common purpose to all players, and are thus blind to any other objective, so you're not alone.
---
Well triage module requires logi cruiser V. So you more or less have to go through all the tiers. 
---
Fax is nice, but it’s gonna depends on your alliance. If you have an umbrella and stuff it’s certainly nice to always have one, but if you don’t do capital stuff there’s not a reason to.
---
&gt; Some people have no interest in PVP. NONE!
---
And there is a protected area of New Eden where these people can play that way: high sec.
---
Null sec is not supposed to be protected space where you can undock and not be at risk of PVP.
---
This comment didn't age well
---
local wasn't "broken". it was only "broken" for a small minority of the eve small gang care bear population who believe they should be able to kill titans with impunity with a small frigate gang and every possible advantage and no risk. Well guess what, the numbers \*resoundingly\* proved you wrong. Move on.
---
Nestors are amazing for small group JSpace combat. However their price point (especially after blackout), abysmal speed (with prop off), and still having battleship scan rez makes them less attractive for larger fleet work. (Also one of the big defensive selling points of the other logistics cruisers is their nonexistant sig radii, which is not an advantage the Nestor has.)
---
Then any faction will do.  Luckily there is more to fw than this
---
Go to Solitude. I’ve had 0 issues there
---
why would pve not be worth it anymore?
---
See that's the thing, I feel like lately kills in NS eve are all based on the person that dies being an idiot, blackout changed that but then it became insanely easy to catch people (to the point that it was idiotic to undock in some cases).  There really needs to be something in between.  Something where there is a skill matchup / counter-plays.  Baiting is always a good tactic which people like Slyce became known for I think that's a good example of counter-play.
---
Now we have to see who there are more of, ratters or pvpers. I bet I know which one there is more of!
---
So, I would argue in that case that the issue isn’t with the game catering to PvE and thus hurting PvP, but moreso not incentivizing PvP. But how do you do that in a sandbox when all you get for rewards is your name on a killmail?
---
&gt;This also affects people who have ratting/mining alts. You either have to get out on those alts and pvp or just accept lower payouts. 
---
Doubt krabs would like it, so CCP apparently can't do much.
---
so take out a battlecruiser fleet.... what's stopping you?
---
My question is if player numbers will increase starting tomorrow since it seemed like the blackout drove some people away.
---
&gt; Go ref a structure and see if they form the next day.
---
Thats exactly what we have been doing since the "war" in the north. With small fleets just looking to find a fight somehow and noon freaking cares at all. We come again for the armor timer and again for the final and noone shows up. It's not even because they would just get blown off the field by our fleet vs what they could bring it's just because they don't WANT to fight. 
---
I don't want people to feed me kills I just want freaking fights. And if anyone comes along with a fleet in our space and all I get is a fleet thats about even I will undock it instead of being scared every single time. If you call yoursel a PvP alliance and don't think it is worth a couple of T1 ships to have PvP then you might aswell quit the game.
---
A lot of ransom betrayals by pvpers hurts too.
---
Nailed it on the head, small groups like that pose no threat other than annoyance, all relevant objectives involve timers, which means numbers superiority wins the day.
---
This is ofc possible as long as you have an additional JC available to avoid losing your highsec clone
---
&gt;You can make the most isk by avoiding fights and just afk farming undefended plexes. 
---
Not only that, but missions are totally retarded for PvP and they pay even more given how quickly they are farmed. It's as if CCP is actively hostile to PvP.
---
Tackling the skiff is whats supposed to cause the escalation into a fight, and I currently mine in null sec in a rorqual outside large umbrella and I have never lost one. If anything the blackout made it safer for me to mine because I was in a random null sec system outside of an umbrella that people wouldnt expect someone to be there or care. They also couldnt tell because there was no local. I got tackled once and I counter escalated to fight the horde fleet that tackled me and killed them. Thats what eve is supposed to be.
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/t/improving-on-nullsec-blackout
---
So, this argument I get and agree with, again, admittedly I am not a Super pilot nor do I live in Null. But having massively powerful assets that are completely safe yet readily available at a moments notice detracts from the want to fight.
---
Warp to me is one of the most popular group for them this is their ingame chat channel  Warp To Me Incursions. And this is the fits they use [https://wl.warptome.net/fits/](https://wl.warptome.net/fits/)
---
Things I don't feel: Sorry for CCP because they have made bad design decision after bad design decision, instead pushing plex sales, skin sales and extractor sales. It was a bubble. They were told it was a bubble. They chose to believe it wasn't a bubble. Now the bubble has popped, by their own hand, and all the problems that actually needed fixed are still there.
---
"wah let me rat in peace"
---
inb4 "ACTUALLY I don't rat and haven't ratted since 1869"
---
Agree. I do think though that balance has always been off in EVE. 
---
I think there are 2 ways to go about balance, 1 super had and one easy.
---
1. Super hard - Make a fleet more powerful if it has a wide range of ship classes. Maybe introduce a synergy that increased stats or something based on fleet composition.
---
2. Balance on cost, a BS fleet should "most" of the time be better then a BC fleet that should most of the time be better then a Cruiser fleet.
---
So much to write, it would take me hours to give you a full response. Short answer is it's not just about the engine.  EVE has a deep history, hundreds of mechanics and design choices that are set in stone and CCP will never change them. Why does the typical ratting fit have zero chance of killing the typical hunter fit? Is that good game design? Just ask any gamer who has never played EVE before to sit down and try it for 20 hours, they can give you a laundry list of problems, reasons to play something else. Why are my guns tiny and silly looking? Why are the sound effects so bad? Why do these NPC "battleships" do so little damage? Wait so EVE is a "pvp game" but there are no abilities or gear unlocked by doing PvP? And I can make more ISK running missions or ratting than doing PvP? Hmm kind of a strange game. 
---
Obviously EVE has been very successful in its niche, but it doesnt have any real competition. There are lots of things I love about it, but a lot of the fundamental game design has never made any sense, and at a basic level the PvE combat is extremely boring compared to what today's gamers expect, so I think it will slowly dwindle in popularity as the player population ages out.  Only a clean slate new release can really bring in a new playerbase.
---
cyno spool up fucks with the larger fights as much as sticking them on a expensive fragile ship currently does. the instant cyno needs to be a thing. getting instapopped means you will never be able to get the subcap fleet in a reasonable position or the cap fleet, they will just see a ship land, they'll target it and they will blow it up long before it spools up.   
---
I don't doubt you mean well but I'd much rather they dealt with the actual issues than going with whatever the scapegoat of the month on r/eve is. and they sure as shit need to move the fuck away from trying to balance the game around the ganking game play. I mean fuck if you read this sub you'd be convinced there is only two types of people who play and that they solely exist to either be krabs that ought to be killed or the elite hunter whos sole purpose is to shoot krabs.
---
I am not crying about it just removing gave power to the PVE blob. I am just naming ways PVP has been rekt.
---
What they could do? Maybe uhh I don't know, inform others that they have been attacked and there's hostile in space? What I showed with my stratios death was that people who COMMUNICATED managed to kill me, all that vexor pilots had to do was say in comms "hey guys there's this stratios in system, I'm gonna go out and bait him so standing fleet be ready"
---
also, I'm not proclaiming I'm skilled friend, I'm literary 50% dangerous on zkill, I'm far from elite
---
Unpopular opinion: fitting cynos on ratting ships was a great way to encourage ratters to engage in PvP.
---
This guy gets it, we need to hit the ratters where it hurts, it's not like they'll just quit and CCP will have to panic or anything...... oh wait.
---
Probably not if they in turn slaughtered cruisers
---
That’s what that aspect of us should look like, yes. So, is it the helping of PvE players or giving the players tools so powerful that such things as umbrellas can even exist that hurt PvP. As part of a smaller Corp, I will never propose that we even try to function in null space because we’ll never gain a useful foothold. All of us out together along with our entire alliance could be wiped completely out of the game by one of the blocs, only because we were trying to play the game.... The fun phrase is “you win eve by quitting”. The only reason for that is the few people at the top are now so far above everyone else they cannot be broken using the game’s mechanics for PvP. They are invincible and enduring.
---
If you can't avoid a suicide gank, in high-sec perhaps you are doing something wrong.
---
At the very least they knew staying and fighting as is was an option.
---
I agree, I was very sad to see the AT go.
---
See thats the path you choose to take. When I ratted in null I used a single rep scram nuets in the highs and I have killed a blackops that way and many hunter lokis. Its easy you just need practice and if you choose to never try then you will never know.
---
They are certainly harder to avoid than a gank in null is my point
---
They don't which is the issue.
---
While I agree that nearly no one enjoys orbiting a station for an hour listening to people do dumb shit in mumble. I think cynos and local are separate issues from that reality.
---
You still don't get it don't you? :) This kind of attitude brought you in this particular spot. You got cocky, pissed off the wrong kind of people as a result you got stomped and lost your home along with months of work, citadels, cap ships and tens of billions in juicy loot (which by the way we thank you for - DO YOU THINK THE DROP COVERS THE COMBINED LOSSES?).
---
We can actually insta replace our losses no matter how high they are. Can you? https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99002974/reset/group/902/losses/
---
More importantly Vendetta is not just a name. It is OUR way of playing Eve. We are a bunch of mean and vial shitlords, we scheme and plot, we have lots of patience to wait for the decisive moment and we do not hit people for fun. We always go for the jugular. Our hits are meant to kill swiftly and decisively. You have experienced it first hand. It is a lesson you will not forget anytime soon.
---
My advice (for the simple fact that you fought well and I do respect that) find a way, and I'd suggest diplomacy, to shake off the big target that you have on your back now (the beef is not only with VMG). Continue with shitty remarks and stupid things in game or even look at VMG and allies in a funny way and you are in for round two. We are more than willing to wait months or even more until you rebuild and we will hit you again, harder this time. Do you want that to happen again?
---
If I have fun messing around in a t1 battleship, or roaming Provi in my hecate (assuming provi comes back on monday, and doesn't just stay dead), then I need to get money to pay for those things, because making money while doing that relies on finding someone in a blingy ship that is both killable and willing to engage me, which doesn't usually happen. It would happen more if I was super careful about choosing my fights so that I always won, but that's boring.
---
So, I need to krab to get isk. I don't want to fight while krabbing, I just want to get it over with.
---
buffing dps would be definitely good as right now nightmares are the way to go for small groups when fighting around something with high enough damage cap like a fort. But outside of small groups it won't increase battleship usage much because once you hit damage cap you will always prefer skirmishing with mobile or jumpy hacs rather than commit slow ass battleships.
---
if you are concerned about a single ship loss you are not making money in the right way, nor fast enough.

Here's the last boring part just for you.
---
Machs weren't the only viable BS doctrine even in their day. Horde more often flew Tempests after the Hakonen war, and had flown Maels before adopting Machs. Goons have flown Megas and Ravens, and TEST has a Nightmare doctrine that we dust off from time to time plus a Megabhaal doctrine we use when we need long-range firepower. 
---
The Horde use of Tempests was partly a reaction to a bad feed of Machs, and partly a reaction both to the hull costs and skill requirements of Machs. Save for the Bhaal (thank you, Goons), pirate hulls are 400M or more a pop and you don't lightly throw them away.
---
I agree the BS tree isn't balanced properly. One wishes CCP would adopt the thinking behind the [old Royal Navy "rating" system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_system_of_the_Royal_Navy) for ships of the line and put the fleet issues at the top, the tier 1s as the equivalent of a 3rd or 4th rate that can fill out the ranks of a fleet led by 1st rates, and somehow give the pirate hulls a fitting tradeoff between firepower or other characteristics that lets them flex between being up to 2nd rates and down to something like a heavy 5th rate.
---
Edit: Or maybe buff Marauders and make them the 1st-rates?
---
i'd rather just make more isk so i don't have to endure the pve for as long.
---
which means there's also less chance to have to deal with pvp i have 0 interest in.
---
This has never been a PVP game, its a sandbox game. PVP is actually a small part of the game.
---
Asset safety removal would be the nail in the coffin of 0.0 space and I absolutely believe CCP is dumb enough to try it and then get all shocked when people quit in droves again.
---
"Ok fine guys, we let you have your local, but now we've removed your local markets and all your stuff just goes poof now. Hey where'd everybody go?"
---
I don't hate Blackout. I hate anything that drives away players. Blackout has not affected me personally other than fewer folks to shoot at as, again, I don't krab.
---
All I see from your response is someone that doesn't understand what makes it "safe" to rat in Nullsec, nor what it takes to maintain that safety, while talking about how hard it supposedly is in WH space.
---
You would be suprised most of null is empty and as long as you dont go shooting any moon they mine they wont care.
---
Combat interceptor - "Micro-warp Injector." might be neat. Put the claw back on the map.
---
A comprehensive look at speed creep and on grid combat too, is needed for balance purposes.
---
Once again pirat shows they really are a pathetic pvp group, getting their shit pushed in by a bunch of lowly wormholers. Not so easy when your enemy has a modicum of competence eh?
---
You are the type of Player that has started the game in the past 2 years and never actually experienced eve. I feel bad for you.
---
This is a sandbox game, meaning it dosent reward you for what "you" want to do. A player ship dosent drop loot, it drops whatever he was carrying that was not destroyed in the fight.
---
wrong.
---
It’s very possible I might be, but then again, why go out there if I can’t touch the resources that are there? For clarity, I’ve been in one null sec system in the last two years and that was just fiddling with explo. I’m mostly concerned with getting my Corp wardeced by treading on someone’s turf. Still though, positioning ourselves so PvP was a daily part of our experience out of necessity means fighting coalitions that may decide we join or die, or possibly just die.
---
you're crying about ccp ignoring you and other pvpers yet you can't be bothered to filter through which changes to pvp were good.  Off-grid links is one of them
---
Go to Geminate, horde has citadels on literally every gate. Their only purpose? As gate pings. That's how broken citadels are.
---
You are on drugs.
---
The doctor should've put you back inside your mother to finish off growing, you clearly weren't finished.
---
So how it works in WH space, except with a cyno.  I fail to see the issue.  Or are NSers just allergic to risk?
---
:)
---
Same :( CCP fails again
---
They don't need to make such extreme changes is the problem. Again everyone predicted what would happen and again ccp didn't listen.
---
Look at lowsec where you live right now. CCP has deleted any source of content in that space. All that is left is run-down low sec and the dwindling numbers hoping ccp will make a change.
---
&gt; Supposedly the highest risk space? 
---
Nah, high sec is the riskiest space in all of EVE not null. It has permanently removed players off EVE than any other type of space. It killed so many new players. Frustrated new corps with war dec mechanics. You never know who your enemies were (e.g. ganks).
---
&gt; Why should you feel completely safe there?
---
Not completely safe, but null with local is what people paid for historically; hence, it is very easy to explain why people drop off when the product they paid for no longer is functioning.
---
can't say i have.
---
isn't it still invite only, anyway?
---
Is WTM the only surviving incursion community? I tried joining TVP sometime ago, was closed.
---
I'll just repost the comment I posted below, because you're basically expressing the same fallacy as the poster I replied to.
---
&gt;Yeah, exactly. For you, you generate isk to do something else. My statement was supposing the activity you do that isk isk generating is fun in and of itself. Thus if you are net isk even but net fun positive, then it is not a pointless activity. It's cool though, many people view eve as though their purpose was a common purpose to all players, and are thus blind to any other objective, so you're not alone.
---
Removal of off-grid links benefited the blob and if you cant see that then you never really pvped back then.
---
A lot of wormhole corps are now war ineligible, due to the fuck up from CCP over the new war mechanics meaning they all ended up permanently at wa,  most of them moved their structures into holding corps.
---
Here is my idea for anoms: 
---
* payout scales with numbers, so that it is actually more profitable to rat with a small group of 3 to 5 people vs. solo - encourages groups rather than solo targets that have no chance against another small gang
---
* rats warp away when in hull, so you have to tackle them - forces pvp fits for ratting
---
* rats aren't immune to ewar, e.g. you can neut them or tracking disrupt them - encourages pvp fits
---
* spawns have a few different comps, that get selected at somewhat random - that way there is no single optimal fit with a huge weakness that roamers will know all PvE'ers will have
---
* then finally adjust anom payouts so that it is worth if after these changes
---
* while we are at it, make the payouts dynamic so that they can be increased/decreased as needed to keep inflation in check
---
Or, more simply put, bad hunters.
---
You say help CCP like they don't have a group of volunteers that actually play the game they could have asked for advice on changes.
---
1 Citadels are too pervasive I agree, perhaps consider a hard limit on the number of them per region.
---
2 I agree that capitals are far to strong and have few counter measures, they have become the solution to nearly every problem.
---
3 Upkeep for supers is an interesting idea, they do have costs for operation (Jump fuel, bridge fuel) but they are pretty minimal.
---
4 I doubt anyone with any sense would participate in a mass exodus of capital capabilities, for most capital ships are their end game.
---
5 Yes. Short term small "impactful" objectives are severely lacking.
---
6 Logistics lines are by nature very hard to disrupt, very few points of vulnerability. (Looking at you JF's)
---
7 Resource Scarcity drives conflict.
---
This post was well thought out.
---
Christ you euros are dumb.
---
Why train skills when you can inject, haha
---
but i thought the PvE content was so boring that is was only bearable and worth you time when you can be afk while doing it.
---
its simple, either do region local so space doesnt feel empty or remove standings from local chat, let them check manually or even better you cant interact with the names in local
---
I dont know man you dont seem to know anything i am talking about. Either that or you a pure-bred carebear retard.
---
Dude, I will say the forbidden word: "Arenas"
---
X players enter paying X isk or X Plex (low end entry price could be like 1-2 Plex) only 1 player leaves.
---
But eve community: ewwww arenas ....
---
Or some alike feature
---
You can PvP anywhere, in 
---
MMO terms that would make this a PvP server. If it was a PvE server/game you would be able to make yourself immune to PvP.
---
Stop sending the data in a way 3rd party tools read?
---
Sure PvE is boring as dirt but I still don't have fun shooting a ratting ship that can't shoot back. That's basically the same thing to me. One just happens to pay out isk. 
---
Now like actual fleet on fleet combat? That's more fun.
---
Amd rework LS as a whole and FW in particular.
---
bye
---
Just because you don't know the plan doesn't mean there is not a plan.
---
You can register for Alpha access, but when I try to register for that, it says my account already exists.
---
depends on what you want. WTM is still active and runs shields. If you want armor TDF is the go to armor fleet for incursion running. Then for vanguards there ssome smaller groups running around.
---
I mean, I'm on caffeine right now but your post history is just you berating everyone in every post. So good job, I guess.
---
The reward should be the satisfaction of beating someone else, I do it because I enjoy blowing stuff up, the more expensive the better. Loot and rewards don't matter.
---
Exactly, you know what's a great isk sink for null blocks? War, srp drains funds fast. So instead of changing cynos and doing a black out. Just make going to war less of a tedious shit fest. 1 reinforcement timer and 0 reinforcement timers on low power, this would make taking space and killing structures way more streamlined
---
The people carrying this game have always been casuals who do pve. You thinking that there was a majority of mostly pvp players at any point just shows how much bullshit it posted here.
---
Citadels are fine duders. Makes resources deplete where big entities need to move to survive and citadels won't be an issue so much.
---
&gt; These players who quit may never come back and if then, only some will. 
---
I have three active subs, and for the most part I've just been high-sec mining and fooling around a bit with PvE and PvE.
---
I'd like to get more involved in a big corp, but the recent jacking around with the rules has left me at the point where I don't know where to start... and my RL time available is such that I'm not interested in investing hundreds of hours getting set up for a way-of-life (WH, Null, Lowsec, whatever) that might go "poof" at the whim of those that run EvE.
---
I get that EvE should be complex...  But I can imagine how I'd feel if, for example, I had spend countless hours and real money getting to the point where I could fly a Rorqual and start doing some serious mining, and then had the rules change so the risk/reward equation means I'll never be taking that Rorq out. 
---
I've queued up skills and cancelled the recurring renewals of my three PAID accounts.  I'm logging in every couple of days to see how things are going, but other than that... I'm playing WoW Classic. 
---
They're making it too easy to win EvE.
---
Removal of off grid links benefitted everyone cause they were fucking stupid ya knob
---
You were doing so good until you said remove asset safety. Asset safety in some form has always existed, not saying what we have now is the right idea but a hard removal is not the way to do it.
---
There are opinion groups that hold vastly different ideas on "what is good for the game"
---
Being the largest group and holding a mentality and pushing an agenda will only result in a game that only that group wants to play.
---
If the game reduces to one group, it ends in that group winning.
---
We don't want the game to "end"
---
It's the people with 10-20+ mining bot accounts that left which is hilarious as they aren't even the "real" players of EVE, yet they're the one that consume the most plex so they drive subscription basis.
---
Thats pretty much trying to teach a rock to swimm
---
I’m actually the lowest of the low, a carebear. Low sec sounds like a place for players to make a change. Take over the turn (I know it can’t be sovereign). The blocs could exert their influence in these spaces and the push into high sec and wage war with CODE.... but that means sub caps... that’s the problem. It’s not that there’s nothing to do it’s that many battles are cap/super battles. 
---
I think the point I’m trying to make really is, it’s not PvE that’s the problem. It’s the way PvP is played by the players. Which translates to, it’s not CCP trying to screw players. It’s players expecting their play style to be THE play style of the game for everyone and anything that has the slightest impact to that is unfair and catering to the “other” group.
---
But they just continue doing the same thing
---
smh think more then you are told by your fc retard. Used to fight 25 vs 3 with offgrid links with tinker setups. That style of gameplay died with the removal of offgrid links. Blob will always have links but you wont because they always have numbers.
---
You see stuff like this suggested a lot.  CCP can't get local chat to be turned off correctly, how do you think they will be able to implement ANY new working gimmick with local chat?
---
1. What is the range for a keepstar DD?
---
Because r/eve thinks there is no one else in the game and only their opinion matters
---
Is it because armor hacs have a longer range and shouldn't have been fighting on top of maelstroms or the opposite?
---
Shit I'm a bot?
---
The problem with battleships isn’t that they don’t do well against HACs in a straight up fight. That is a problem, but what really puts the nail in the coffin is their vulnerability to both stukas and dreads. HACs can go up against stukas and win, they can sig tank haw dreads and kill an objective from underneath them, they are fast enough to disengage pretty easily,
---
G O D  B L E S S
---
I'm missing the part where you reinforce your idea that you can't chill in your own space. But you literally just proved my point for me, thanks
---
Uh yes they do, massive reduction in capacitor usage of large reps.
---
I agree it was imbalanced being in complete blackout but putting it back means exactly what I said, the barrier to entry becomes too high.
---
The happy thought of never seeing falcon again. Don’t tease me.
---
This salt was summoned in 2 minutes after thread creation. Need grade A salt with rapid delivery? Call PIRAT today!
---
No kidding they only want the perfect change for them and they want it at once.
---
Yeah sure that's why PC Gamer are writing articles on the daily about some guy's big tick and literally every person I've ever talked to rl about EVE is like "oh yeah that's the game with the really cool PVE right?". It's a big part of the bread and butter gameplay but its never been what attracts people or keeps them here.
---
if they remove the freakin timezone tanking from structures and make sov-warfare semifun again, respectively finally add a reason to actually go to war over besides "i want this particular system" then we can talk :(
---
Big words kid, or brain dead adult
---
I am not wasting my time to play chicken and mouse for hours in a excel video game.
---
Some people aurally have real jobs responsibilities and kids.
---
Reality hits you hard when you realize there is more than just pixel points.
---
I had an argument with another guy where he pointed out PA bought CCP for tech reasons, not the game EVE, but the tech behind the game.  The game is an added benefit, but not one worth sinking shit tons of money into if you really just came for the tech.
---
becasue what reason do they have to do anything else, given eve's current mechanics?
---
Try cloaking up a single ship in a wormhole, and just log on every few hours to look for targets, and let me know how many kills that gets you.
---
 Camping a wh doesn’t work because there isn’t a reliable time for when krabs come out, and because you can’t easily bring in reinforcements, at least not without launching probes and splashing k space holes to scout them in. Which obviously spooks your targets.
---
Liking mining is fine. It’s those that like mining and expect to do it in relative piece, in nullsec, that’s the problem. Might as well just remove security status and concord
---
So then we start there, and then if it is still to strong we iterate on it. The problem was making a massive sweeping change.
---
This is a valid point and should be a consideration.
---
Good call!
---
Can we has their stuff?
---
I can fix EVE in 2 steps.
---
1. Get rid of super capitals. Self explanatory. (Or at the very least revert them back to Bridges and Clone Busses and take them out of the combat hierarchy)
---
2. Introduce resource depletion and reduced anom spawn rates.
---
I.e. the more you mine from roids or moons or the more you rat the less they spawn forcing people to contest others for more usable space and fan out.
---
The game is dying because people can sit under their super umbrellas and harvest unlimited resources and rats. There is zero incentive to engage other groups for space. The "farms and fields" initiative and making resources available everywhere always was the biggest mistake CCP has ever made. Period.
---
Dude I’m a trillonare like I know hand over fist what it is to “work hard” to get what you want. I own so much shit it’s stupid as fuck, AT ships, Titans this is my second komodo and, I would trade it all if we could get something that would blow up titans easier, if we could make them a lot less viable. They won’t, cause guess what hits the news? “1k sub caps fight over a I hub” or “1k titans worth over 1 million dollars stare at each other menacingly” CCP eats that shit up cause every major battle brings in new blood that eventually quit or join a null bloc to make cannon fodder for the RTS strategy game that the top 1 percent of alliance heads are playing. Wars don’t matter anymore, imagine this, Test is deployed to Frat space mining and ratting in FRAT space to force them to fight. Imagine that shit. I’m so distraught with the game that I just couldn’t play it anymore. All my at ships my new Komodo my titans I would trade it all away for something meaningful and impactful to happen to the game. But CCP has to look at the bottom line, and I get that, it just sucks.
---
Well it's something. Full blackout and full local are both bad choices. They need to make some middle of the road change but pvpers don't want middle of the road.
---
It's not that you can't mine without an umbrella it's that it's less profitable and efficient to mine in other ways.
---
&gt; I mean, doesnt the meme go "Eve is dying"
---
3 years ago we'd see 40k online, even before the black out we were hovering in the mid 20's, its not a meme when its true, and considering the frequency of wars declining the games health under the "Farm Simulator In Space" model isn't anything to question.
---
She's dead Jim.
---
typical hisecer btw
---
I would also reccomend deleting your discord img cache, if you get effected. upon deleting them from all sent metheods aswell. seting dms to friends only and the like. hopefully this will get fixed, but i have already had most of this inplace its just something to remember. 
---
and hopefully discord will implement better bot removal. love the servic but even after 4 years shit like this gets annoying as all hell. discord is great but it has a lot of creeps, sadly.
---
The thing that confuses me the most about this is how you managed to even get them to stay undocked long enough to fight and die
---
remove anoms and make incursions default type of PvE, sans the multiple rooms (So no safety behind gates). Also fix Scout sites to not suck in rewards.
---
Want solo combat PvE? Keep it as either belt ratting for faction/officer battleships or run scannable combat sites. Want more reward? Go run incursions with either a small group of pilots (Scout), medium sized fleet (Vanguards/Assaults), or large fleets (Headquarters). Mothership sites shouldn't allow capitals in it.
---
Tie iHub upgrades to types of sites you "detect" and quality of belt rats (More upgrades = higher chance of a faction battleship spawing in a belt).
---
I dunno, just my dumb idea.
---
Im okay with this if they put a timer on cloaks
---
High ain't safe Hoss
---
POS were a much different beast than citadels.
---
* Smaller timer windows
---
* Timer windows based on stront
---
* No damage cap; bringing more friends helped wipe it out faster
---
* Tethered only to moons, so there was a hardcap on them per system.'
---
The POS system wasn't perfect, but for attacking/getting content, they were much better than citadels are.
---
price point is not solved by introducing new ships, its solved by tweaking the costs/drops of the one already there
---
&gt; abysmal speed (with prop off), and still having battleship scan rez makes them less attractive for larger fleet work
---
so they are a battleship and have the same characteristics almost all other battleships have?
---
The base sig thing is a negative compared to regular logi cruisers but then again the thing keeping them from being used really isn't the inability to sigtank
---
Search help
---
alot of HICS to hold them down once they undocked :D
---
&gt; That this shocks some people is weird.
---
It doesn´t shock these people. They´re used to getting contested while PvEing. From their standpoint exclusively fitting for PvE while gimping your fit just to increase average income by 2-5% is a dumb thing to do because when you have to run every time someone looks at you funny or have your sites stolen because you pussy the fuck out you fuck your income way harder in the long run.
---
&gt; We need local to be based around mechanisms that can be interrupted and harassed. It forces content and it also requires players to defend their space in null security space.
---
Original comment is about having a safe spot for carrier ratting and other activities, not strategic timer generation.
---
Thanks but...
---
&gt;I'm not interested in a corp really. I come and go to Eve too much and  prefer rolling solo for convenience sake. The most 1v1 frigate fights I  can find is my goal, and I'm hoping being a militia member will help  goad folks into fighting me if I pick the right militia maybe.
---
It's an old copypasta from when Vendetta Mercenary Group was a thing.
---
a pve pilot made every ship you have ever flown.
---
You have his eyes 👀
---
You want to be in gal/cal warzone.
---
The changes they are making mean nothing to new players. Someone who has no idea what Eve is isn't going to sign up because of blackout or cyno changes. They need a marketing push, a working NPE, and plenty of actual fun PVE content if they want the game to grow. 
---
A niche game doesn't get out of niche status by appealing to the niche players.
---
Didn't we have that pre and mid blackout and they still threw a fit?
---
that only applies to incredibly high tidi slugfests, which this was not
---
you're wrong.
---
&gt; I would say it's a good idea, but doubling doesn't even offset it. 
---
it would, according to the MER
---
so there something to do
---
to encourage pvp
---
That is what I am saying! We need the pve guys
---
As long as the goal is to do solo/small group CONTENT and not encourage solo/small groups, it should be fine.
---
The Blackout was supposed to encourage solo/small groups. It only removed "content"...
---
you're retarded
---
It's already broken in Providence - can see people from other systems in local :-/
---
Hey buddy
---
I dont know who you think you are? maybe you are some big shoot in eve or maybe not....Listen very carefully to me PAL this advice is free and I will only say it once so listen good....if you even look at those pocco's again you your corp buddie's and anyone else you know will not be able to undock from station you will spend your days in a NPC corp. hope you get the message PAL
---
Regards
---
**WOOLF BLOOD RAIN**
---
There are like 10 people doing solo PVP in FW. Stay neutral if you want more fights.  
---
If you join a militia you end up being blue to 5 of those 10 people.
---
At the same time it was really fun going 15 km/s in a dramiel when nanos didn't have that stacking penalty.
---
At no point should you gain boosts from a ship that is not currently on grid. That was the most risk adverse bullshit this game. Im on your side but like the dude above said, you actually need to select points that make sense for your argument.
---
That's worrying
---
Wonderful to see 😂
---
If by "engage in PvP" you mean "drop 30 supers and fax on a 10 man phantasm gang and sit there impotently for 10 min waiting for the cyno to go down" then sure. But nobody with a brainstem thinks that that is PvP.
---
we need short term objectives that are relevant to sov warfare. We have enough timers.
---
Yes but I am saying these huge alliances are just maximizing their returns based on current game mechanics the only way to change hat is to change some aspect of the game so it’s not lucrative for them to blob up
---
There is also that you do not need to fit MJDs anymore but can just bring a few ships with you that do it for the whole fleet, not relying on everyone to hit a button.
---
The only people who think skill injectors are a problem is those who think their investment entitles them to an additional margin of security.
---
All skill injectors do is highlight fundamental problems by bringing them to the fore.  The only thing that was making broken content work before was that many players were leaving the game before getting to the broken content.  That's not much of a fix.
---
&gt; in an actually populated nullsec
---
you mean the delve krabs are logging back in?
---
The upside to baiting out and engaging pvpers would be to spank them and send them home in pods. Guess where they won't be hunting next time?
---
&gt;Krabbing isn't fun
---
I mean this isnt wrong. Otherwise you wouldnt see AFK(insert subcap) ratting.
---
Move supers to null, or establish more ways to push them around, pin and engage them in low.
---
Resource Depletion, is a very important conflict driver.
---
Can spawn is the key there. All that needs to be done is have those be the only thing that capital ships are allowed to rat at
---
now you've changed from "pve-ers" to "blobbers"
---
Another reason why CCP will never listen to you
---
That's how I always viewed it. After being annoyed at how quiet it still could be sometimes, I was just trying something new. It seemed to make sense when some people said "being a war target will get you fights that would ignore a neutral." I think for now i'll stay neutral and spend more time in black rise area instead of Heimatar area. Earlier this year BR didn't seem busier than Heimatar but maybe it's not the case now.
---
I pvp with my limited play time. It's not a waste of time to me despite only losing isk
---
that is true, I was just thinking of remote cap reduction
---
f
---
What do you mean they added emerging conduits that need to be done in battleships.
---
By GF I assume you mean Get Fucked correct?
---
More Relevant rewards for holding contiguous space. 
---
Objectives that are relevant to Sov but not based on timers.
---
We have different opinions on the matter. But I do agree on one point, you cant have 2 conflicting philosophies as we have now.
---
Alright, I'll move back to my staging in Black Rise. Earlier this year when I was first trying this, I set up shop near Amamake and near Tama, but neither seemed to really have more activity than the other and I got more used to Heimatar and Bleak Lands. It looks like Black Rise and Placid may be noticably busier these days though. Thanks!
---
Why should there be safety? Babies cant handle their risk averse gameplay being taken away :'(
---
Would you prefer everything stayed exactly the same? That would get old so fast.
---
They need to add a storage tax to stations.
---
That would just have the same effect.  People start losing ships to PvE they stop PvEing and they stop playing.  You're just going right back to what he said not to do and that's to hurt ratters.
---
Infrastructure isnt what causes adaption, people do. And bureacracy is thing.
---
To his defense, there were times when alliances could not bring alpha doctrines because they lacked the numbers in that fleet. Now there are often fights (ok, were) in which you could bring enough destroyers or even interceptors to alpha a BS.
---
The problem is d-scan.  D-scan should help the hunted as much or more than it helps the hunters.
---
People talk about local delay, but nobody talks about d-scan delay.  If d-scan were passive, or the settings affected the scan time, it could be easily reshaped to ration the amount of information it gives out.  
---
There are also ways to make the information it provides less precise, and the possibility of making natural phenomena mask the information provided.
---
All a scanner really needs to show is sites, or general information about places players can go.  It doesn't actually need to give any information about the players or drones at all.
---
great, but we're not talking about pvp.
---
we're talking about pve.
---
He chatted in local then logged off
---
On posts that are advocating for things that have proven to drive players away or have no basis on reality you are damn right I'm gonna berate you.
---
People write articles about tiger woods yet the average golfer is a 60 year old dentist. You have to get out of your bubble and see the game for what it is.
---
 stop having bad ideas Lorenzo... the proper response to a bad idea isn't another bad idea. p.s. stay the fuck away from my rorquals.
---
No, but you should always live if you are prepared and active. Always. 
---
Nobody is forcing hunters to chase bigger prey than they can handle. And those that do know what theyre doing. I mean Ive seen plenty of shit die under umbrellas. Its right there on zkill. Join a bloc and be a part of the umbrella and see for yourself.
---
Because most people that claim to be pvp players are just null sec carebears that don’t actually pvp unless the odds are well stacked in their favor.

---
i mean its fine to make mistakes, everyone is shit when they start and even experienced dudes sometimes fuck up pretty bad, it happens. What is truly scary is when those fuckups with blatantly obvious solutions turn into a balancing issue by people that somehow can't just keep burning foward or switch to sanic mode and warp out with 3s align
---
&gt;so they are a battleship and have the same characteristics almost all other battleships have?
---
Yes. They are a battleship and have the same characteristics as almost all other battleships have. So this one isn't so much an issue with the Nestor itself as it is a blanket issue with the ship class.
---
&gt;price point is not solved by introducing new ships, its solved by tweaking the costs/drops of the one already there 
---
Yeah the Nestor's in a weird place, price-wise. Where the Nestor is now at 700mil is where you'd expect the price point to be if you were buying them off the SoE LP store. Where the Nestor was a year ago at 350mil is what they were brought down to by dronelands ratting and getting that one item that you can trade in for them...
---
So yeah if we don't get a better supply of that one Rogue Drone Nexus Chip, or some other way of getting BPCs that's cheaper than their (current) LP store price, the Nestor hull's gonna sit there at 700mil

Although even taking the hull out of consideration, most Nestor fits I see (wormholer^(btw)) easily approach or pass 2bil, just off of the rest of the modules fit to them. When you can rig up a FAX for 1.6bil (and get 400mil back in Insurance), and get greater tank and repair output (and cycle time and lock speed) out of the FAX because Triage, it takes a bit of the wind out of the Nestor's sails as a logi platform...
---
Not all bots are alpha VNI toons - look at the recent “transport to highsec” super events for example. 
---
And yea, a lot of normal players quit - again, CCP need a balanced system or it’s obviously not going to work, I know too many great pvpers, and entire groups, who have quit due to game changes.
---
Thats the thing, the people arent against major changes if its done in balance. @CCP\_Falcon and his team ignored the players and just did what they wanted without taking advice into account. Hopefully CCP will learn to listen to the players as well
---
So instead of typing my intel into an ingame chat channel I just type it into a Discord channel.
---
Ratters will still play because people like seeing a number climb.  People will always rat to get more ISK just to have more ISK.  Look at clicker games the literal only point of those games is to make a number climb higher and people download and play those like crazy.
---
If the PvPers all quit that doesnt really affect PvE at all.  They can still make their ISK and build their ships, miners will still mine to get more ore to drop more structures.
---
Just look at renting corps, they rent systems to PvE in they almost all do close to no PvP they just have fun mining and ratting.
---
Look at how many people just stay in high sec never getting into a PvP engagement their entire eve career and just do missions to buy faction and deadspace mods to run more missions faster.
---
PvPers are not essential to the survival of the game get over yourself.
---
Sort of meta question here / idea
---
I hear that there isn't enough wars going on in Null or w/e, and there's too many structures and cap dropping, etc, no reason to fight.  AFAIK there's no mechanic to actually make people fight...
---
I'm a very strong believer in the risk/reward model as a solution to create gameplay however
---
That's why I think w-space was one of the best designed things ever (high risk high reward encouraged people to explore and not sit in their POS or home system 24/7)
---
And so along that line of thought, why not design an area of Null with very good sites or rats, but where you can't have any structures or stations, sort of like a no-mans-land, and cyno range is decreased or removed. 
---
Like W-space, but all the routes are all permanent with no mass limit, you can bring any capitals through, etc. And you dont need to scan the gates obviously, they are on overview.
---
I imagine this web of static routes to connect opposite sites of K-space null.  Like a permanent web of routes, superimposed on top of where empire space is. Except it doesnt appear on your normal system map (or maybe it does but a different color/layer? idea)
---
Just a thought to move the gameplay away from structures and cap dropping a bit
---
Lore-wise:  It could be a network of wormholes that the empire engineers figured out how to keep open permanently.
---
Edit:  The lame thing I realize about this is nothing stops an alliance from logging off a bunch of caps in one of these systems and just waiting for some juicy targets to come through. Somehow barring this,
---
yeah soon they be 20 bil
---
Fix the bounty system so that pvp players actually get a payout for killing.  Remove the need to loot wrecks automatically give the killer the loot. Let every player pick a station that the loot goes to so that there is a way to make isk pvping.
---
I agree, however, I also think injectors where a really bad mistake by CCP. I would be 100% ok with the complete removal of injectors.
---
But that just furthers the point that they don't feel it's worth it. What good is reffing a 1 bil isk athanor when they don't feel the 3.5 bil worth of ships to defend it is worth it? Go ref more and start showing up for timers. Either force them to fight or force them out. That'll get you content, one way or the other.
---
Or, CCP could alter structures so an athanor isn't so cheap and people feel the need defend what they have.
---
v0v
---
Delve was always the most populated, what are you even trying to get at here?
---
HACs and T3s shouldn't get any range bonuses.  
---
Application, damage or less general bonuses are probably fine.
---
remove weebs whilst we are at it
---
Fair enough.
---
Really good idea
---
“Carriers beat frigates use dreads”
---
Approved
---
I feel you, I personally am in the minority of FW pilots because I've never run a defensive plexing alt, as I've never been particularly good with one account much less multiple.  However, basic idea behind it isn't to necessarily try to play both accounts well so much as it is to have a character floating about in disposable ships who attracts fights.  
---
Anyway, if you do decide to give the militia a spin Moira is always recruiting competent solo / small gang pvpers. Or training incompetent ones with good spirits. : )
---
1/10, i actually clicked in to the thread.
---
the same as always
---
You could have just did your usual ratting routine in low sec for almost the same results you know...
---
&gt; I'm thinking of something like a 'competitive dungeon' where there's a bunch of loot cans, and you and a bunch of other nerds compete to loot them as fast as possible, and you have the option of mugging another guy for his loot if you think you'd win.
---
so kinda like how it was in the Aether Wars demo?
---
No, that's if you make the rats to hard, if you just make the more PvP like and slightly harder. It shouldn't hurt them to bad.
---
Why do you want to fix what is not broken according to CCP?
---
Another utterly retarded suggestion on WHs, we've had a glut of them recently.
---
Or how about....hear me out....they rebalance the shit they have right cause you know....it's long fucking overdue, but sure...lets keep adding retard shit to the game.
---
No, you don't give a fuck. You are not everybody, you are just one guy and some guys agree with you, cool. Plenty of other people did give a fuck and agreed with me. Deal with it or don't come to the internet again, ever. People often disagree with each other here you know.
---
CCP didn't make a mistake by trying to shake things up. They made a mistake by showing their hand too early with sweeping changes that were hard to swallow, giving all you chickens a heads-up to mass-unsub, not login in protest and hold the game hostage in the process (yes chickens, for example you were waiting for the blackout to be reversed so you could come here and safely gloat after the fact, lol).
---
Well, if things keep going like that, enjoy your barren nullsec wasteland circlejerk in a couple of years, where you all playing with each other and yourselves, and nobody else from any other part of space interacts with you, save the occasional gank, lol.
---
The longer you keep throwing insults around, the longer i will antagonize you in a non-cursing manner and provoke you to throw more insults. So you can either stuff it and stop trying to force your egotistic, ill-argumented opinion down everyone else's throat, or escalate until your posts are ban-worthy and i report you. Also, check your blood pressure, all that salt must be driving it sky high and i wouldn't want you to have a stroke over a video game. "Here lies X, beloved friend, who couldn't handle random strangers on the internet having a different opinion so he had an aneurysm instead." It would be quite sad and unfortunate.
---
Bye bye sweetie.
---
A player from my alliance said that he had 20 members in his corp chat at one time. And nobody on Mumble. His corp has 1200 members...
---
It would be fine to just remove ships and drones from d-scan results.
---
If there is a need for a more nuanced approach, make anomalies, ore sites, moons, buttons, et cetera all incorporate scan inhibitor zones.  
---
Players know they can go to those sites, but they don't genuinely need to know if they will get a player encounter in them.  If sites proliferate, then that is a kind of camouflage in itself.  People that are warping around can be seen.
---
Realistically, the d-scan should be passive and slowly update over time, proportional to range or other settings.  If it is nerfed appropriately in some areas, it can even be buffed in others, such as automatic distance estimates.
---
Buff the NPC stats and behaviors so that pvp fits are most effective, and so that squadrons of NPCs require squadrons of players to challenge them.
---
Awww, and you almost had a constructive argument going with your first sentence there.
---
Too bad you had to turn 12 years old for the closing part and make the whole post unworthy of taking seriously again.
---
You'll do better next time without having to resort to "shit" to prove your point, i'm sure. Keep trying, it's not that hard.
---
Trying to combine pvp and pve doesn't work. They are best kept separate. It's better to concentrate on pvp if you are doing pvp and pve if you are doing that. Trust me.
---
This attitude that is the problem, you accuse everyone of being a baby for not liking those changes. Try being civil and not start with name calling.
---
It might be a good idea to join a losing side.  
---
I switch warzones every few days, black rise has more people but also more blobs.  
---
To find fights also use the FW thing and sort by capture status. People tend to be around the high contested systems.
---
im pretty sure triage outclasses all logi in effectiveness for the price if you don't use no tank gimmicky t1 logi, so v0v, more an issue with triage being too powerful than with the lack of bs logi. 
---
You may be overestimating their prices however, a quick look at zkill show only a few passing 2b even post blackout prices(https://zkillboard.com/ship/33472/losses/npc/0/), and the ones from goryn that, while a bit old, were used exclusively for high end null pvp(https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98567606/losses/ship/33472/) never really reaching that point. Although to be fair with the deadspace prices hike it may be a bit of a different price and go over
---
ps:i mention the goryn ones cause some losses, even with no npc interaction were krab fit so yeah
---
I approved of CCP's changes, except for the nullsec blackout. The blackout was a constant blackout, what would have been neat (and better lorewise) would be a randomised blackout, for say, two hours randomly. Or even three. Or a proper delayed chat.
---
Blackout had good PVP opportunities theoretically, but quite honestly i just saw less activity during the blackout.
---
I dont disagree. But you cannot, and I cant stress this enough, cannot use 1 point of data, specifically niche items to talk about inflation/deflation. Isk value is a question of purchasing power. If you wanna measure your ability to purchase things in comparison to another era you have to look at the whole picture.
---
Lets say you buy PLEX which went down lets say 25%. But all other products went up by 50%. If you spend the same amount of isk on products as you do on PLEX that means you have less purchasing power, lower isk value, more inflation.
---
This is how economy works my man, its not up to me or you to suddenly change the rules because we dont like them.
---
By no means, its speculation. Which is what I wrote earlier. This happened to recons when the cyno change was announced as well. This happens everytime a change is announced.
---
And heres the problem with PLEX. CCP didnt have a PLEX sale for quite some time before the BO. I dont really keep an eye out for PLEX sales but according to many others it was an unusually long time between the sales. Then I think they did 2 sales during the BO and SP was given away. These things affect the PLEX price but it had nothing directly to do with players or the game itself. Do you see the issue of using it as sole indicator?
---
It is a new pve activity. You can see invaded systems in your agency menu. In the invaded systems jump gates and stations might be camped by NPC enemies. There are also combat beacons that players can warp to and engage waves of NPC. The thing is profit comes from salvage of these NPC. The combat is not suitable for a rookie pilot but you can make a business out of it if you build trust and if you charge cheap.
---
Idea is to talk to people who run these sites and convince them that you can do salvage behind them and save them time for a cost of.....
---
I dont know if its a common practice but if salvage is your drive, its worth a try.
---
truly a piece of art
---
\+1000 HS coins added to AFK
---
For a visual if you look at the graph of y = ln(x) you can see the trend pretty easily. Still increases but more and more but slower over time
---
No. But you still cant use just 1 product. Everything else went down in price during that time, far more than what PLEX would affect players. You have more isk value now than before.
---
Honestly the farm heavy side usually flips with the warzone. When I started doing FacWar in 2016 minmatar were the farmers that held most of the Amarr/minmatar warzone.
---
I know you said you weren't looking for a corp but regardless I'd recommend just picking a player corp that sounds interesting to you. I really enjoyed running Amarr with Dirt 'n' Glitter. It was the most [glorious shitposting](http://i.imgur.com/lE43yy8.png) in the game I've ever seen. Though if that isn't your speed there are plenty of other groups like Templis CalSF for Caldari, kill em all for minmatar. Etc.

There already are systems like this in place in the game right now. Both sec status and faction status follow this general idea and do not drive people away. Or if they do it wasn't enough to make a blip. 
---
To be fair, I haven't seen one idea from your recent posts. I'd love to know what ideas you have to solve the issues plaguing us today.
---
They made hunting so easy only idiots pve in ways that risk them.
---
You used to have time to finish your current site/mission when you started seeing combat probes, now you have 6 seconds.
---
Because those babies pay the bills. Did you not see what just happened when they tried to take away the blankie?
---
After insurance you maybe feed a couple hundred mil at worst. SRPing a couple of Ferox wont hurt any alliance at all. Also it's not about forcing people out if it were theres a supercap fleet that would handle it not 30man for fun fleets. Also the same people that don't show up to fight come into Fountain 30min later feeding a couple bil there but you know maybe they can catch a ratting ship before that because it won't fight back. It is not about the ISK it's about just not taking proper fights because you might lose them also known as being a pussy.
---
We don't want to catch them, we want them to leave our game and play hello kitty online where they belong.
---
Low power (after a week of it for instance) means imo that it should die right away. If you cant be bothered to fuel your structures then it should die right away.
---
Eve is not fixable without pissing off players. period.
---
Either eve will shrink to irrelevance within 4 years.  
---
Or CCP will have to live with losing 50% of their paying customers over the next 2-3 years due to massive neccessary changes to the game.And be able to grow again after that.
---
Uh, we have ganked several hunters. If killing the hunters stopped them, there would be no hunters. We've counter dropped them and wiped out their dreads and such and they're still back because A. they still usually catch more than they lose. They catch 1 carrier or rorq and they're isk positive for a long time and B. they want the activity.
---
*bye
---
CCP tried that and it turns out they are more important to the game than you are.
---
If you really want to dig down into the details then yes, i can concede a point there about the umbrella, but not about the plexing of accounts. So, in the interest of making a correction:
---
The more people krab to plex, the more demand and higher prices for plex. So you either need to rat more, or you need to mine more. And in the case of mining it's even worse, because the mineral oversupply tanks their prices already.
---
As for the rest, the overall theme remains the same. I don't care about prices because i don't make isk that way.
---
All i care about is margins between buy and sell or different regions.
---
And since there is almost never a time where all possible items in the game are equalized and unprofitable across all of the map, i'm pretty much unaffected in the short to medium term.
---
Long term? Sure, if mega-krabbing coalitions kill off the game entirely then yes, i would be affected, but at that point it wouldn't make much sense to debate if my playstyle is effective or not in securing my independece from being a null line member and doing my own thing, because there would be no game to play in the first place.
---
Always crying on reddit.
---
Eve is a very deep sandbox. If they want to know why the game isn't working for them all they need to do is look in the mirror.
---
or find other activities on that terrible exits? looks a good idea to thinking out of the box!
---
Whilst I'd change the detail, the high level idea of a local module that fuctions as an ESS is excellent,  madness that StainGuy said something I could get behind to any degree.
---
Thing is that all the fuss over local is basically about giving small gangs something to hit.  The original farms &amp; fields idea was fine, but as it has developed there has been no fields to raid and pillage for small groups.  This idea with some tweaks could provide exactly that (I wouldn't have a reinforcement timer though, unless it is 15/20 mins or so) as it would be something you could "bell ring" as a roamer to get the sov holder's attention.
---
P.s. can't be anchored with 5000km of any citadel.
---
It is exactly the same kind of PvP as warping a phantasm gang onto a myrm...
---
I think we're talking about both. Making money to fund pvp does sometimes mean you are at a net negative if you lose those ships in pvp.
---
Full local needs to go. There's no question about it. At the very least they need to implement a constellation local. Full local or full blackout was the extreme and people fled. 
---
Cloaks need changing. T3 cruisers need changing. Cynos are fine now. Station spam and alliance sov need tweaks. The blue on blue wave needs to be controlled. Implement sov changes in a way that space can only be gained if attached to current space. 
---
Listen to the community as a whole. Give feedback daily. Don't cater to the loudest whines.
---
If you think there are uniform resources across the map, you have been listening to too much hlimar.  The only resource available in all regions of space is t1 minerals.
---
There is no counter to fighters other than constant mjd at which point all you can do is sniping mjd cancer because if you do anything else people can just shoot your mjds and draw your bs fleet into fighters. You can defend against bombers more easily as long as it’s not 4+ bomber squads
---
If you think that in any way what happened with ransoming CCP to maintain the status quo is good for the game you are legitimately mentally ill.
---
Yes, i know. Sad day for me and for CCP.
---
Good Job efeke:) Nice dicking:) [https://zkillboard.com/related/30000142/201909151700/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30000142/201909151700/) F respect:)
---
Pointless. If they hurt the krabs, krabs will protest not log in again.
---
make a group that actively looking for good chains instead of lazy rolls then..like INIT
---
I mean last time they tried risk/reward balancing a third of the game unsubbed. So when simple solutions (with what we have right now) don't work for whatever reason, you have to add complexity or leave it unfixed. 
---
Sov was tuned, and is still considered cancer. Citidels were tuned but are still considered cancer. Blackout succeeded in its goals but was not well received. 
---
This adds gameplay, variety and addresses (not solves, but addresses) some current problems in a way that isn't that heavy handed. Its gimmicky though I'll admit.

What needs balanced, specifically?and what solutions do you have?

like nerfed 500mn HIC? lol...imagine what nul guys just had
---
Pve is too attractive.
---
A ratting Dominix has about the same chance of beating 10 Cynabals as 10 Cynabals has of beating 10 supers, none. If super on Cynabal action isn't PVP then neither is Cynabal on ratting ship.
---
Make Jita 0.0 for one day without an announcement.
---
Not if the rewards are worth it. People do lose ships to burners and high tier abyssal deadspace. They continue running it because it's profitable even with losses.
---
That must be coming from a murican.
---
They can't fix their playerbase. Different than not being broken
---
He said great ideas, not retarded ideas that the majority didn't realize would fuck the PCU. When the idea of blackout was first aired back in 2013-2014 basically all of the null sec living CSM predicted exactly this would happen, yet a majority of the CSM who were dankmeme 420 PVPers or even high sec residents said hell yeah.
---
Basically what I'm trying to say is that the vast majority of players in EVE are fucking retarded and should never voice their opinion because they are completely unable to see the long term effects and broader picture of what they are suggesting. As long as it benefits them in some way, fuck the rest and don't listen to any counter argument because by God, I don't want to be fucking wrong on the internet. Some posters on this subreddit is the perfect example of this.
---
Today there are people who argue that blackout was a good idea even though the player count went down significantly (and supported by numbers posted in threads here!) and it, by CCPs own admission, caused mass unsubs.
---
The last hope is that they never come back and CCP can be brave to add some more balance to the game. If what you will be implemented, krabs would just shoot each others in cheap ships to get the standing.
---
Yeah, mate, its just my opinion that dropping a ton of caps on a cruiser is a problem.
---
I have to stay still to mine. Unless you think a proc  can fill it's ore hold in 1 cycle. (It can't btw)
---
Genuinely agree with you and I'm really bad at Eve despite playing since beta. I still struggle to make ISK as I won't get myself into to Meta.. I like your idea of constellation chat, say 5-6 systems but to go along with that. Make it so that ships can refit in an instant by having a dual loadout mode.
---
With one click the PVE ship and switch to a PVP loadout aslong as the modules are in the ship and can fit. 
---
One means the price of a ship kill goes up with more modules inside but you have a fighting chance to get away or fight.. this encourages people to think about a fight and have a semi decent chance to do it..
---
That’s not a new thing
---
You say that and yet here we are, CCP caved to the people whining about ganking requiring even the slightest bit of skill and now numbers are collapsing and everyone is scratching their heads. No one is out in space and whaling is dead because no one is willing to undock those juicy targets with the game the way it is
---
That is completely false. The vast majority of this subreddit was ready to burn The Mittani on the stake when he predicted this would happen on the metashow or whatever they called today because hurdurr you're just trying to protect you Rorquals in delve.
---
It shifts over time, but also... You're looking in some of the more meme-y places where it can be hectic for a solo guy to operate.
---
I really like the gal side of that warzone. Quieter but still nice fights....
---
How about ratters and miners are the backbone of eve and just leave them alone to have fun the way they want.
---
Killing ratters in 2012: Head out in a thrasher and be good at dscan (wheniaminspacethrashervideo2.mp4)
---
Killing ratters in 2019: Hundreds of accounts to cloaky camp the region, multiple dread alts, multiple spy alts. Still only kill the bottom of the barrel retards who can't do something as simple as light a cyno and be on comms.
---
&gt; From their standpoint exclusively fitting for PvE while gimping your fit just to increase average income by 2-5% is a dumb thing to do because when you have to run every time someone looks at you funny or have your sites stolen because you pussy the fuck out you fuck your income way harder in the long run.
---
Lol nobody does this.
---
Look at people who die to burners, the most "PvP" like of the PvE activities. The common ships don't have props in favor of dual web, don't have scrams because burners don't warp, don't have damage controls because they know they can tank the burner rat without one. These ships get annihilated in PVP so the person doing burners has to run at the first notice of someone showing up. Even if they "PvP" fit they are half dead from the burner while the ganker is 100% healthy, it's not a "fight".
---
The only way to make people truly "fit for PvP" is to have the PvE content be so easy/not DPS based that you can fit for PvP and not gimp your income. This happens mainly in 2 places; FW plexes because there are no rats shooting at you and draining your tank, and supercarrier ratting because anom rats are a joke to supercarriers and they have plenty of room in their fighter bay for sirens/dromis.
---
You are not alone. Blackout was fine and the original cyno change proposal was okay. The half-assed industrial cyno addition is what does it for me.
---
My experience with wormhole predates HK and other entities, around a year after WH was released and I remember when we opened a wormhole to another C5 that had the same constellation, we'd go out and clear the sites so there was a chance of it spawning in our system to, as you say, do capital escalations.
---
it wasn't a huge driver, but the fact that such a simple mechanic motivated players to do PVE in a PVP setting is note worthy.
---
Its already the preferred site for most cap ratters, there just aren't very many of them.
---
^^^
---
IRC aside, I'm fairly certain almost no one has ever heard of any of those, lol. Not saying they're bad but you shouldn't be talking like it's common knowledge. It'd be nice if something more protected took off, anyway, but as an MMO guild leader I doubt I'll be able to get people to jump ship any time soon.
---
500mn HICs were retarded and thankfully nerfed.  No Local helped restore a bit of the risk null is supposed to have.  Your suggestion here nerfs PvP more than anything else.
---
there's a difference between hard, and building game mechanics designed solely to add tedium to every single thing in the game. Hilmar doesn't understand this because of how little he plays.
---
&gt; I think we're talking about both.
---
we wern't.
---
From CCP's behavior, it's obvious there is no plan.  Otherwise, they wouldn't be backtracking on one of the changes.  They'd be moving forward with the plan.
---
pvp is the same as pve to me in terms of enjoyment. similar thing except one pays me to do it.
---
I've been watching this latest "chaos" saga happening in Eve with a sort of morbid fascination these past few weeks. I barely log in anymore, maybe once every 6 months to take a quick look at changes, eve-mail a few old friends, and then log out again for several months. I basically that asshole slowing up traffic while gawking at a flaming wreck on the opposite side of the highway.
---
I can understand how some people would be sad; "the poor devs." "They're suffering from all the negative backlash." "The bottom line is hurt." "The game is taking a nose dive." Here's the problem with "working" with CCP. 
---
Some devs, like a CCP Rise for example, will actively solicit feedback from players and CSM. Devs like this take feedback to heart, and will adjust their ideas and design to make meaningful change that will have less negative unintended consequences. These guys are easy to work with, and generally their design ideas don't break the fucking game, or if something does, they're willing to work with people to make them not suck.
---
Then you have some other devs, like a (former) CCP Greyscale or a CCP Fozzie. These guys think they know what is best for Eve, and to hell with people who think they could be wrong. They are nigh impossible to work with and only learn by getting emphatically faceplanted by the community, and usually the "bottom line." They also seem to hold a certain disdain for Devs from the previous category as people who 'enable' the player base.
---
These "chaos" changes have been wrought, seemingly, by devs from the latter group. The changes have been rammed through, regardless of warning from the CSM, and community leaders, and much like the old Monoclegate of yore, are having to face the difficult reality that some of these design ideas were probably ill thought out. Unfortunately, this group also generally lacks the humility to admit they might be wrong, and if an apology is forthcoming, I'd imagine it'll be written by someone in the fiction department again, assuming there's anyone left there that hasn't already been laid off.
---
So, unfortunately, if you guys want changes rolled back, and things fixed proper like, about the only way it's going to get done is if CCP is facing a severe financial setback as a result of these decisions. Remember, Hilmar justified the monocle changes because several dozen people were dumb enough to buy the damn things.
---
I can tell you first hand that this game is more than functional with only 4-6k concurrent players at peak. Oh, there'll be a few less devs to run it, but it's a sandbox (or it was supposed to be) so it's not like huge teams are needed to crank out content. Hopefully they keep more of the devs from group A than from group B.
---
The worst thing you guys can do if you are unhappy with these changes is to keep buying subs, undocking, and playing as you have been in hopes CCP will come to their senses on their own. All that will do reinforce is their belief that they've been right all along.
---
No they really weren't go back and read through those days again. There are tons of threads and comments complaining about it being a bad idea, but the l33t lord downvote brigade did their best to bury the. And the official forums were FULL of people saying it was a shit idea. It was a VERY small group that thought blackout was the best thing ever that would solve all Eve's problems.
---
I'd rather people that just want to collect isk all day be involved in a tragic car accident.
---
Unfortunately what you describe isn't really in line with how eve damage works canonically.  If you pump 2000 dread pew pew into a single point, it would obliterate the object and anything around it.
---
Because eve only has a passing acquaintance to modeled physics, what you suggest would be difficult to implement.  They attempted to do something similar to what you suggest with passive shield tanking.  It gets stronger as more damage is applied until it gets overcome, and the system collapses.
---
If they gave armor a similar mechanism it would be closer for some applications.  
---
Another idea is to implement damage saturation, or angled deflection but those require an overhaul to the physics engine.
---
One deals with a historic disaster of epic proportions.
---
The other dealt with a ship sinking.
---
Tell that to a certain big bloc fc who moved a dread cache 30 jumps from home and actively patrols our area for something to drop on after one good fight.
---
imagine calling yourself a pvper yet only ever seeking out pve nerds, and not trying to bait out actual response fleets for brawls.
---
God you are a fucking idiot.
---
23bil nice

---
Wtf kind of ship are you flying? Nothing that can rat can take on 3 lokis and live.
---
No offense but when people demanded station defense timer, doom was on the horizon. UO did it right, don't build it if you can't defend/lose it.
---
Cry more and go back to your wormhole dude. Just because not everyone plays like you doesnt make their playstyles invalid. You’re not an elite pvper for going out to hunt ratting myrmidons.
---
Personally speaking, citadels in WH space killed it for me. I lived in null but I did most of my messing around in J-space. They just turned it into null with moving gates set on ‘random’ mode. POSses were a pain in the ass to live out of but it SHOULD be a pain in the ass to live out there. It’s way too easy now.
---
Regarding the game as a whole, I don’t think it can ever be fixed as there are too many people who want different things. And when significant changes *are* made the supernerds figure out how to min/max it in a few days (if not hours), and then complain that it was not enough. It seems like the endgame for some players is to actually bring about the end of the game itself.
---
Tbh it would screw over smaller alliances
---
Magically teleporting super capitals against subcaps is noteven remotely comparable to roaming into hostile space with a gang, but OK.
---
why i said spodbrain is bcoz they usually comment negatively before read the whole points. what you miss from the story is :
---
1. the minerals is limited as NPCs have to mine it first. if you want NPC to not selling minerals then make a fleet to wipe the mining fleets (content)
---
2. minerals is huge in volume, its not easy to haul them and bring to your sotiyo elsewhere. you need a gating charon with webbers and supports to bring 1mil m3 of it. or worse you can use a rhea and got your production cost exploded so its not efficient in any way. (also content)
---
&gt;It is a new pve activity. You can see invaded systems in your agency menu. In the invaded systems jump gates and stations might be camped by NPC enemies. There are also combat beacons that players can warp to and engage waves of NPC. The thing is profit comes from salvage of these NPC. The combat is not suitable for a rookie pilot but you can make a business out of it if you build trust and if you charge cheap.
---
This sound exactly like what I want! haha thank you!
---
There's three main Incursion communities.
---
TDF: An Armor fleet currently top dogs at contesting and are usually taking all the best sites (fastest) most of the time. EUTZ mainly but expanding. 
---
chat channel = TDF-Official 
---
NGA: Used to be they we're the Russian version of TVP (topdog of shields). They're still are very good now and have opened up to English and German speaking players. EUTZ mainly.
---
chat channel = New Galaxy Age 
---
WTM: They run the closest to 24/7 but they're fleets tend to be heavily shit fit and tend to run very slow. They also have a none contesting rule which forces them to run the worst sites (longest) most of the time. USTZ they're light on numbers but the fleets tend to be better as no one is around to contest them. 
---
chat channel = Warp To Me Incursions 
---
There's also the F.I.N. community which is mainly German i think they don't run all the time but are getting more regular.
---
Chat Channel =  **F.I.N.**
---
Not so much rudderless as poor navigation. 
---
The original devs had the vision and Hilmar was the guy in the office wearing silk shirts and shiny shoes. When shit went down and the original devs left the ones remaining had at least been exposed to the original vision. The newer devs, not so much exposure. They had their own plan in mind. Over and over they implemented those poorly thought out plans leading to today-ish.
---
Hilmar, after watching the devs do their thing for years, said to himself, "Hilmar, you sexy bastard, you can lead Eve into its final chapter and make a lot of isk in the process. Then you can retire to a place that doesn't smell like farts."
---
Now we're at today without the -ish.
---
Or something like that. IMO anyway.
---
when did you start playing this game
---
&gt;and not trying to bait out actual response fleets for brawls.
---
I almost exclusivly do just that when out in null, but that's beside the point.
---
bsbbtw.
---
Good riddance.
---
that's only true if your ratting ship lives long enough for people to jump to it... which rules out everything smaller than a cap.
---
I agree driving away players is bad but how many were bots? How many were the 12th alt of Mr rorqual army. Neither of those are great for eve either so I'm happy to see them leave. Now legit players I have an issue with leaving which is why I'm asking. Because I believed it was good for the game as a whole and still do with some changes to counter the negative effects. Such as perma cloaky camping as this is a problem in whs also just more potential counters.
---
But I can agree blackout wasn't handled the best by ccp. IT SHOULD have been the introduction of upwell observatories.
---
Local is what makes NS safe. Simple as that. The fact you can see everyone in system before they even load grid and report it to your friends is why NS is so safe. It shouldn't be, there needs to be danger to eve and local has given us free infinite Intel for to long.  Cynos get a foot note here but are less a problem. There is no counter to local.. it's just free infinite Intel for the residents.
---
stukas, bombers, capitals, the fact that taking muninns is just straight up better and a multitude of other issues.
---
"you can't bring an overwhelming force to counter me, despite me using an overwhelming force to kill you".
---
CCP once implemented something like that in FW. It turned out (surprise!) that in the world where your characters can count as enemies of your other characters this stuff is highly abusable. The result is known as "FW LP Forex" and it was so bad that CCP had to revert not just the change in question, but even state of wallet / assets of players involved, never to try something like that again.
---
I'll keep saying that alts is one of the several reasons sandboxes like EVE are doomed to eventually fail.
---
Both parties had access to dotlan and zkill. The fact that you are incapable to use those tools for yourself doesn't mean it was unbalanced. But if they took dotlan and zkill away or put them on delay I wouldn't really care either.
---
Minus the 'goons win' I agree, I think it's too late now and we're on the slow path towards what happened with serenity. If the game is to survive you need drastic changes that'll lose a lot of players, it's like chopping off a limb to save someone. The alternative is keep the higher yet slowly dwindling population in a game that is getting worse.
---
Simple. Don't force people into putting up so many due to mechanics.    
---
Discourage people from anchoring to many, not promote it.
---
TDF is still around as well
---
121% Nope.
---
If anything I am having an easier time hunting in jspace.
---
Edit: not in wingspan but almost full time solo wormhole hunter atm so I have a similar playstyle to the wingspan life.
---
lol thought so
---
or we just go back to what we had before the black out and you can adapt or die?
---
not like you really need to even adapt since that was the reality a mere few weeks ago, just carry on as you were.
---
Who are you talking about? Which "leet pvp boiis" do you see?
---
Listen dude, we told you when all the BO bullshit was kicking in that it needed balancing. That it wouldnt work and that it would slingshot back. This is very much on you guys for not engaging in healthy discussion and rallying behind your fellow players.
---
If you had, and CCP has seen that the playerbase is saying something in unison, something they can all agree too....
---
that'd be great too
---
Yes please. We have every single major size of logi (frigate, cruiser and capital) except for battleship. Bonus points for adding XL-Shield Transmitters for these new ships (like the XL Shield Boosters we already have).
---
because local is cancer
---
ADCs are a cool idea, but like many things that CCP has introduced, they need iteration, which just never seems to come.
---
ADCs could be balanced somewhat by just making a cruiser sized version and a frigate sized version, and having the cruiser sized version require 600-800 cap to activate.  Then cap warfare would actually be a viable counter vs. Muninns and Eagles, and hitting a Muninn fleet with a wave of void bombs would fuck them up royally.
---
That still makes them tough to counter but it helps, and then maybe there could be some other change later down the road to tweak them more, but we'll never get there because CCP never iterates on the fucking changes they introduce.
---
the risk only exists because you don't know how to avoid it though, ie the hunters are just better than you. if the hunters are better than you you deserve to die. Theres so many mechanics that pvers can utilise to make it borderline impossible to gank them efficiently, but they just dont use them, and then demand they are relatively safe regardless. thats why people dislike carebears. FYI this has been the case since the game started, miners in hulks that dont even fit defensive modules complaining that they get suicide ganked etc
---
Small gang pushed people to make groups bigger and bigger. That's nonsense. And taking away local doesn't "make it better for the 10 man group than it does for the bloc."
---
16h connection between Fountain and Esoteria (direct or via wh) is not nerfs PvP at all mate :)
---
Boosh BS fleets and anti-Muninn Megas/Bhaals were the last gasp of the BS era.  They were the only possible niches left for BS to really fill in large bloc warfare, with the possible exception of providing an immobile cover fleet for your supercaps when you hit the "All-in" button.
---
Obviously you've never actually done anything but shoot rats and mine because that's not how it works.
---
Woukd it? Smaller region to control, less spread, they can focus more on keeping it up.
---
I don't think it's the players who are the problem but rather CCP itself. 
---
CCP has a track record of shooting itself in the foot on a regular basis. 
---
For example, you mention stagnation, the last big conflict got actively grinded to a standstill by CCP itself deploying Drifters all over null-sec then introducing blackout which no one can even hope to break up stagnation between the big power blocks.
---
The only thing that did was giving small gangs and bomber fleets an advantage in raiding. 
---
Now they further cemented this stagnation by complicating the move of caps, again a change that will not further real conflict between the big blocks but rather making the life of small raiding parties a tiny bit easier. 
---
If CCP really wants to undo this stagnation they have to redo resource distribution, sov, citadels and the process of acquiring supers and/or their importance in holding/ acquiring sovereignty.
---
Then why were you guys, and I remember you especially, being such big cunts in the past 2 months? Why did you refuse to listen to any reason?
---
We tried to engage you guys more times than I can count to get something what would work for all. You shot yourselves in the foot with your toxicity prompting this situation.
---
contain your autism you clown.
---
Ooorrrrrrr they could not blue everyone either side of them and be able to pvp without needing a direct NS to NS or through WH.  Keep in mind NS to NS got nerf batted after people cried about T3 fleets using them.
---
reasons please so i know how to respond :)
---
I still have a tristan with a missile launcher equiped to it. How time flies.
---
There's certainly a problem with the composition of the CSM - though thanks to organised voting and good campaigning, we've got a hunter and a wormholer on the CSM this time, so it should be better - but even the nullblobber representatives have told CCP that some of their changes have been too krab-friendly over the last few years.
---
See below and work on your reading comprehension.
---
This is a huge fallacy and so wrong.
---
If if you use 300m plex vs 1.5bn plex, then income should have gone up 5x, but it did not.
---
It was possible to get 90d gametime for 280m in the day
---
Corp window wouldn't open on any characters except 1.
---
Ah dont listen to him dude. He still hasnt received the news that overpowering hunters wont work.
---
A timer 15-30 sec or until gatecloak breaks. Some adaption for bigger systems is needed tho.
---
You can't because there is a larger growing segment of the game who simply want to play farmsville casual eve online with as little pvp as possible.
---
I kind of disagree a single tower can let you build a titan in a single place for like a 1bil.         
---
Now you need 3 structures to do it if you don't want to overpay ... but it still cost you like 60 bil?            
---
What structures ?        
---
1. Sotyio      
---
2. Azbel (part production)             
---
3. Tatara (refining)                
---
Like wtf          
---
In the pre citadel era you didn't have indexes - you didn't have to spread out but you could use a single system for every thing.          
---
Yes earlier was better (aka before unlimited lines) because it limited how much you could install in a specific place.
---
&gt; I don’t even mind more risk or less yield while mining if CCP decides I can make too much Isk from the time spent playing.
---
So wait, why don't you like the changes?
---
More risk - nullsec with blackout should be fine then
---
Less yield - mining in HS should be fine then
---
Cloaked cowardice doesn't need to be buffed.
---
Sigh... you do know that even before the resources being all in i e region, no one actually fought for the rare stuff right?  the alliances just made OTEC to share technium resources. alliance dont fight for resources. they fight for personal reasons. ALL eve history proves this. 
---
nothing ccp does will make null fight. your leaders need to want to fight, but atm they are fine sitting on there asses milking tax money or running a news site and hardly log in.
---
thats the basic fact.
---
Back to your spod fuck face
---
Wait they left the safety of undock?
---
The new modern eve player started post 2012 and doesn't understand or care about game mechanics.
---
Site farming over downtime was so common everyone fucking new it.  Mission guides would even list the missions worth DT farming, and the in-game system would even incentivize with with the payout  scaling system.
---
&gt; It didn’t impact botting as much as people like to believe. The bots just moved to highsec.
---
So you're saying it impacted botting to such an extreme degree that they stopped doing the thing they were all written to do, and went to do something with much lower payout. That sounds very positive.
---
True that. Yet, going for FAX or logistics in general is around one year journey and you dont skill anything else to be useful in other roles (apart from typical support skills like CPU/cap/grid, you dont have any gunnery/missiles skills etc), thats why I wonder if its worth to go that path?
---
MVP Comment. This is one of the core problems the game is suffering from.
---
Cloaked ships regain their honor the sec they decloak. Thats a fact.
---
I don’t know man.  If you can manage to get such an emotional response as what is flowing in this thread you must be doing something right. 
---
If only we could get the rest of Eve could care about something, or hate another group, as much as some people do PIRAT and we’d probably have solved much of the game’s issues. A return to the glory days when people we motivated by an actual desire to beat the other guys.
---
I used to take on full fleets of Ishtars, by myself, in my rookie ship. 4 large Nuets in the highs, 4 1600 plates AND a passive shield tank. I didn’t need a scram, just my one hobgoblin and civilian gun! It was easy, you just have to practice...
---
At a certain point I just stop listening to these kinds of people. They’re only hear for one reason, and it ain’t constructive discourse.
---
Na, we dont need to accept any middleground. You guys had your chance and you proved once and for all how you cant handle the burden of balance.
---
there is no account, if u are registering and erroring odd are u already registered your email.  only thing i can think of.  or someone regd for u
---
They spend more time cloaked than uncloaked, thus they remain dishonourable
---
Pre-blackout: adapt or die noob!  
---
Blackout happens: REEEEEE UNSUBBING ALL ACCOUNTS REEEE CHANGE  
---
After blackout: aDaPt Or DiE nOoB
---
I didn't play it myself but if you wanna tl;dr how the mechanics worked I'd love to listen. 
---
My actual point of reference is the OSRS Dungeoneering skill. You go to a place and hit a button, and it drops you into a dungeon full of monsters loot chests. You can go as many levels deep into the dungeon as you want, until you either pull out &amp; cash out, or die. I'm imagining a multiplayer version of that but in the wilderness where other people would frag you for your items, and even if you didn't ever encounter another player, you'd still be competing with them to find and empty the loot chests first.
---
I get it is better to deal with the devil you know than the one you don't.  However we are hitting a breaking point where keeping Hilmar around is creating a certainty the game will be shutdown.  When you have such a high probability of total failure, making a change and embracing the unknown because the only realistic option.  I wish it wasn't that way but here we are back at the same issues that made Incarna the debacle that it was.
---
as someone playing the alpha, its linked to ur google or itunes account (i think u can use fb too) if ur just registering then see my above reply
---
Nope.
---
Not true carebares used to stay in high sec. Ore was mined in hi sec and imported to null. Only after rorquals and citadel spam did you see the players that were risk adverse moving from hi sec to null sec because of the new mechnaics making isk/mining ridiculously safe. This in turn ruined the null sec pvp landscape and caused most of those players to leave after years of waiting for ccp to do ANYTHING to balance them.
---
this common, happens offten in alliance chat, esp if they talk n log
---
&gt; high-sec was even more dangerous to mine in then null
---
Which is exactly why something needed to be done and why CCP shouldn't have caved in to the crying. Do you not see how ridiculous it is that null (with local) is safer than HS?
---
&gt;WTM: They run the closest to 24/7 but they're fleets tend to be heavily shit fit and tend to run very slow. They also have a none contesting rule which forces them to run the worst sites (longest) most of the time
---
I've won a fair few contests as WTM tbh. They don't go looking to contest, but they don't usually back down when others show up either.
---
This guy gets it huge time and energy invested in citadels and they ruined the game. Krabs being able to see you coming 10 jumps out just dock up in a structure that takes a week to kill. Fast forward a few years and the universe is littered with these structures. Null and low sec are just about as safe a high sec.
---
Blackout was a failed idea, let it go...
---
I played EVE for 10 years, what made the game fun to play the first 5 years, is gone.  The last 5 of my 10 was hoping they would fix the problems CCCP made.  Finally it was not worth subing 4 accounts and my time.  
---
EVE is dead.  Just let it end
---
Explaining why blackout is a good thing and why the sense of entitlement associated with expecting to keep local is unreasonable is not being a 'big cunt'. You don't get to claim your side of the argument has been the reasonable ones when your version of "what would work for all" keeps the biggest problem entirely intact.
---
This fish has fermented several times over.  It is time to get a new fish.
---
none of those things actually help anything, for what you want here, to nerf near2 and the like they need to either ditch chat logging or find a way to delay it so that third party tools like near2 can't scrape the logs to work.
---
It is for a basic PVEer or a DED site runner.
---
mlyp
---
There is no need to fight if a big alliance has everything they will ever need within a region.
---
THere doesn´t need to be new things to fight about, there need to be less rewards for the overfed people in those alliances. You don´t go hunt if you aren´t hungry and your fridge is allmost exploding.
---
Asset safety removal is not a reason to fight. We already have that in k-space, industrial citas, and nobody is in a rush to kill them. The entire discussion of asset safety is yet again a vocal minority thing and its so obvious because "big" thinking wont result in "hey lets shut down our entire isk making apparatus at home and pay countless billions in deployment costs so that maybe we can get some loot from structures we shoot at". 
---
It wont work. Instead whats gonna happen is that you can kill off entire alliances that were unprepared for an attack just to kill the alliance. Guess which ones that is? Long term you will only strengthen the biggest guys and once and for all end the chances of smaller groups to enter NS.
---
It simply will not work just as the BO didnt work and I sincerely doubt the cyno change in its current form can work. If you want more reasons for conflict, which we all do, create new things for us to fight over. Dont just delete mechanisms in hopes of us all just losing our minds and start behaving in a strange manner.
---
You should be able to mitigate but not completely remove the risk of PVP.
---
o/ All!
---
A week ago I made [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB4D_hP-R4g) after having talks about Planetary Production with people who said it's too hard, confusing, or too time consuming to set up/maintain. I finally got around to this part of it where I show what to do with basic materials that you extract, and how to make higher tier stuff! Hopefully this helps people get into PP. It's an awesome source of passive income that doesn't require much out of you. Ironically the last thing any PP'er wants is more people doing it but eh :P
---
I do see your point and it would be better than today. The trouble is if people support that, CCP will do that and never iterate again.
---
None of these were viable in the days of guided void bombs, which is when the general consensus was that Machs were the only useable doctrine.
---
You're really raking in the downvotes here, but yes, I was basically suggesting some kind of freeform arena concept with abuse-prevention mechanics. X players come in, X-Y players come out, but the total value of isk in players' wallets increases due to loot picked up from arena rats, prizes, etc.
---
I still cannot fucking believe battleship scan res is directly comparable to dreads and carriers.
---
ur a retard
---
I can't imagine what CCP looks like to the rest of the game developers out there.  Multiple failed and unrealized projects.  That is not to say that every company churns out sure fire hit after hit, having a clunker every now and then is a give.  But CCP has had a running set of failures, and at no time were the people in charge of cultivating these failures ever held responsible.  
---
After the second failure someone should have said "we need to reinvest in EVE to replenish our income stream and ensure the longevity of our company."  That didn't happen and here we are.
---
We have plenty of reasons to kick over each others sand castles. Nobody wants to though because it's a huge pain in the ass. It takes over a week to kill a single astrahus. Seriously? Have fun grinding through 20+ citadels every system just to burn an empire. Even with 200+ man daily fleets, it would take months.
---
God save us from what we have already.
---
It is also free, infinite intel for the hunters. Stop being bad at Eve then crying for CCP to nerf everyone because you can't kill them enough. Others are getting plenty of kills. Why don't you look at what they do and emulate that?
---
Local went away, kills did not go up. You guys cried about the umbrella, so cyno changes come on. How much more hand holding do you need?
---
Newest example: 
---
Fatigueless jbs that are safer than taking a normal gate. This kills what used to be hostile camping in enemy space and roaming opportunities.
---
If you rebuild it they will come.  Field of Dreams joke aside, having the Alliance Tournament was just another source of content and an engagement point for the player base.
---
That makes no sense either, both are good and need to be balanced.
---
lol this is retarded go away
---
So are you saying that they up the difficulty and also up the rewards?  Or are you saying that the rewards in nul anomalies are so good that there could be a slight difficulty bump without making them not worth it to run anymore?
---
I think that has its problems also, Its basically an auto dscan.
---
I think either remove player names in local and just have the player count or remove local and also remove covert cloaks.
---
Delve isnt what null sec pvp used to be and if you think that then you are blind
---
we will see this in 2025?
---
Asset safety.... you're talking about different things.
---
There's nothing stopping you from setting up your own arenas without turning to instanced content...
---
&gt;damage saturation
---
Definition please? Like, "if you shoot at one specific spot too much you don't do damage anymore because there's literally nothing left there to hit" or something?
---
That's like asking why is CCP developing other games and then a few months later announces the project is shutdown.  It would not be the first time a company has grossly over extended itself, shutdown and left a construction project halfway finished.
---
You're right, I mixed up the comment you replied to with another one.
---
I'll delete.
---
If you are big enough for someone to take the time put a dreadbomb next to you then you are part of a large entity and not a small one.
---
I never made that argument bud, might want  to get your own eyesight checked out there
---
Is this yet another elitist post? Has it ever occured you to be a grown up? To actually engage the other side? Cause reading your comments, I cant see that. 
---
So I dont really get what you want, you want changes that cant work, you refuse to listen to the other side and then you bitch and moan when the inevitable happens.
---
Assets have always been safe in outposts, I think the issue is that every single citadel has asset safety whereas it should be limited to certain ones that an alliance sets as staging structures.
---
If a ratter is paying literally any attention at all they are guaranteed to be uncatchable, unless they happen to be in warp to the anomaly you randomly pick and warp to.
---
People die with local because the risk level is so low that they are not paying any attention.
---
&gt;  Adapt, you're doing it wrong
---
Funny how this doesn't seem to apply to krabbers and miners
---
Yeah there's no good way you can get directly paid enough for *killmails*. You can have a competitive moneymaking scenario that involves PvP, but the profit can't be sourced from something players can directly manipulate like that.
---
No
---
&gt; Lol nobody does this
---
how would you of all people know? 
---
&gt; Look at people who die to burners, the most "PvP" like of the PvE activities
---
Nothing about burner missions is in any way, shape or form PvP like. The reason why you have to run 100% of the time is because the ships you are allowed do them in are so limited in their scale and capabilities that you just can´t compensate for another factor on top of that. They are pretty much the only form of PvE where this is true. So good job for picking that strawman to fight against, i guess. 
---
&gt; This happens mainly in 2 places; FW plexes [...] 
---
It happens mostly in exploration based activities like escalations and DEDs and some forms of low-med WH farming and, yes, anom farming. Also null/low missions. It happens in FW as well, for obvious reasons, like you stated correctly. 
---
&gt; there are no rats shooting at you and draining your tank
---
who said rats shooting at you equals them draining your tank? 
---
&gt; anom rats are a joke to supercarriers
---
anom rats are a joke to everything. that´s their whole point of existence.
---
I don't see what you claim to be an issue as an issue. So why would I need to propose a solution to a non-existent problem? 
---
The problem is there is nothing to fight over. My solution is to kill Fozzie Sov and region lock ore again.
---
Your idea is easily exploited, does not hash out what constitutes PvP, how the rating would go up or down, nothing. You literally threw shit at a wall and prayed it would stick, then bitch when everyone doesn't suck your dick.
---
Who cares about wormholes lmao
---
I wasnt able to kill 3 lokis at the same time and sometimes I wasnt successful successful, but I made more isk killing bling t3cs/blops then i did ratting lol.
---
Yeah i cant believe i stopped playing eve 2 and a half years ago and everyone was complaining about the same  things we are now. Conflict drivers, Sov being aids and Citadel proliferation.
---
Somehow I come back and everything is exactly the same, its like CCP hasnt even touched their game.
---
Lol. They literally pay people to think about how to fix the game, and they can't so you're asking the people who PAY to play it to have solutions?
---
Damn it's easy ! Nerf damage cap on stations. Reduce number of anomaly per system, or make the -1.0 exponentially better than the 0.0, reduce asset safety and citadel's still drop a percentage when destroyed.
---
Ahhh, Jabber?

Tried actually getting into a fight before and you will see what I mean. Its not i stopped listening to these to types of people. I wasnt killing multiple lokis at the sametime, but I could kill most lokis on a 1v1 because they dont have the tank, and since you are in a ratting ships most people dont actually think you will fight back. Try undocking and playing the game and you will know what I mean.
---
/s what you say is REALLY funny /s  
---
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT FOR ALL THIS TIME!  
---
thousands of words spilled over how to better FW mechanics, and some were really GOOD ideas, same goes for WH and 0.0. Did they ever listen when we told them "rorquals will be the death of 0.0 and will inflate the market?" nooooooooope, they just raked in on the amount of injectors needed to push pilots into rorqs and now that the flow of cash is reversed, guess what? guess what?? just let it die ffs.
---
Guess I'll let you get back to your autofellatio. o/
---
&gt; I still don't have fun shooting a ratting ship that can't shoot back
---
Nobody but bottom feeder gankers has. Go shoot ships that shoot back v0v.
---
Losing 80mill isk bcs isnt the disaster you think it is.
---
Goodfights that end with a loss are a hell of a lot better than optimizing the fun out of the game
---
Refusal to engage in conversation and going "adapt or die" for 2 months most def isnt "explaining why something is good". Obviously it wasnt as good as you say it was right? We wouldnt be in this position if it was right?
---
Which is exactly what we were saying. This was predicted 2 months ago, how did we know? Are we magical beings that can see the future? No we actually know the people around us in the space we live in. We knew it wouldnt work but we were willing to compromise. I remember how cute your side was with "just let it happen".
---
Atleast take responsibily for the fact that you guys were utterly toxic, more so than Ive ever seen this sub be. You felt entitled to changes that benefitted you over the majority and you are paying the price now. 
---
So no, we dont need to compromise at all. Get that through your head. When things were in your favor you had bargaining power, you currently have none. If you want people to accept a compromise then you need to get off your high horse and engage without being the same toxic cunts your group has been.
---
And please educate me, what is the biggest problem?
---
wtf are you sm0king lmao. Use your brain sometimes and stop trying to shut down the otherside with words like "elitest" or "bitter vet."
---
I mean the blackout def did, pre blackout we would be pegged on intel 5+ jumps out of deep ratting pockets.  During black out we only got pegged on intel once or twice.  I'm fine if perople report to intel channels using overview, that actually requires attentiveness unlike ctrl+A ing local and waiting for something non-blue to appear.
---
Jesus Christ, this guy is an idiot.  
---
OP: just create an alpha account and try it for a few weeks. I love this game and have been plying it \~7 years. There are up's and down's like every other game has but overall it's still the best game ever made IMO.
---
Has enough time really gone by that people don't remember shadoo?
---
It's [Bo Burnham's Lower Your Expectations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xag8rrbUKU)
---
&gt; to pvp in an actually populated nullsec again 
---
 nice
---
How about PvP Bots?
---
Thanks for that XD
---
Which has fuck all to do with delve kiddo. Maybe go back and read this thread again.
---
Alright I'm done with you your putting words in my mouth I'm not even a hunter ffs. I'm looking for a conversation and your doing nothing but being a troll. 
---
I said it was the wrong implimentation. But your just dead set on having your local be perfect free Intel. It's fine have fun playing in NS I'll stay in whs space it's not worth the TIDI bullshit anyways.
---
Dude what? Stop drinking whatever youre drinking. Carrier ratting is by no way billions isk/hour. Superratting isnt even a third of that. And if you think carrier ratting is afk then it just goes to show how little you actually know of things.
---
We defend it on a daily basis and you dont understand why people have issues with the new cynos just as you dont understand carrier ratting isnt afk or billions of isk/hour.
---
Yeah.  I don't have as much free time for playing games anymore, so sitting on a tower for 2 hours only for the fleet to stand down made me quit.
---
Seeing the average players logging in down to ~25k now, seems a lot of people agree with that sentiment.
---
Didn't get to see any WIPs or any of the footage until now - turned out awesome!
---
yea like I personally would like something close to local delay being gate cloak + 15 seconds, not too far swung in favor of the krabs nor hunters, and as someone who is west coast US it would be slightly more rewarding to try and hunt things without having to try and setup drag bubbles off citadels, or an insta lock log off trap. and for cap escalations in NS sites, have rats start using those meme tanked SISI warrior HIC fits (the ones that can face tank 5 application supers no issue) and spam spawn dread rats
---
You get that its 300m/h right? For something that requires maybe 50 hours to breakeven. And its potential prey while it does it.
---
And that you have level 5 abyssals which can be done in HS with the same income? Or incursions in HS with close enough income. Or burners for more income? And so on.
---
&gt;10x the profit? Are you nuts? Everybody and their brother already has a Titan or two.
---
I don't. Nor does my brother.
---
&gt;Rorquals and Carriers are out there AFK mining and ratting Billions of ISK per hour.
---
Collectively perhaps. Nobody is doing this alone. Also you don't afk rat in a Carrier lmao.
---
&gt;You should be cool like us, and have a Bot that immediately initiates warp to your Citadel as soon as a strange name enters Local"
---
Thing is people cry about player intel channels too (all big alliances have these). Player made intel isn't gonna disappear and make stuff safer for the lone Loki who wants easy kills.
---
What are you talking about .. when was the last time you actually saw munnins .. its the bombers and command dessies these days .  No one flues cruisers or bcs
---
Are you blaming technology now?
---
So why not keep black out and adapt or die?
---
in this case the opposite.
---
It illustrated how organization between null sec alliances is vastly different.  Some groups lack the ability to organize or may not even want to.  At least local kept them viable.  A Null Sec under Blackout conditions would only further encourage smaller groups to fold into highly organized ones.  The fewer groups pursuing their own agendas, the fewer chances for conflict and content.
---
Look at it this way with local plenty of players relied on it thinking "eh if someone shows up I'll see it in local and figure out what to do."  Of course sitting there for a while feeling a false sense of security they stop paying attention and suddenly they are tackled.  Now in Blackout there is no false sense of security, you know there is an unknown, there is more of a reason to pay attention.
---
In Blackout out the attacker is invisible but the danger is clear.  In the previous system the attacker is visible but the danger may not be clear.
---
Basically there were these black clouds that if you flew into them, you'd get points. You could find these clouds by using a sonar pulse. You would also get points if you dealt the killing blow to another player (or bot when the devs started throwing those in). If you died, you were supposed to lose all those points (it didn't happen sometimes though as the demo was a buggy mess).
---
the first
---
Seems like definitive proof that CCP was just throwing shit at a wall to see what sticks.  They had no actual substantial changes planned, just a bunch of low effort Chaos bandaids.  This worries me more than anything announced.
---
EVE BATTLE ROYALE
---
The blackout should have been applied to lowsec and/or npc null, if it had to be applied anywhere. Lowsec is SUPPOSED to be dangerous space - it's controlled by the empires and they "consciously" choose not to have Concord police it. 
---
Sov space, on the other hand, is supposed to be as safe as the entities living there choose to and are able to make it. The blackout would have been much more tolerable if it had made the transitional space that is lowsec more dangerous, rather than turning our homes into a ghetto.
---
I dont need to try and shut you down, you are doing a perfectly fine job doing it yourself. And I wouldnt call you a bitter vet, thats actually a positive thing. I am calling you an elitist who thinks he knows much more than everyone else and has no issues pointing out your supremacy.
---
But as it turns out, you dont actually know much more since you and your group were obviously very wrong.
---
Lol pirate is such garbage
---
remove capitals problem solved
---
&gt;when was the last time you actually saw munnins
---
today
---
You arent very familar with bloc level warfare are you?
---
local in whs okay... no local in high no local in low... dscan interdiction aswell
---
If you aren't a hunter, what difference does it make to you? How is NS having local detrimental to how YOU play? I'm betting it doesn't, you are just screaming about local because you either are a bad hunter or are just jumping on the bandwagon.
---
I can't find a post of mine where I said 'adapt or die'. And in fact 'adapt or die' is a meme because nullblobbers (like you) unironically used it at any PVPer or small gang player who didn't like the many changes CCP has made to make nullblobbing ever safer.
---
&gt; we were willing to compromise
---
Lol really? I don't recall you making any suggestions that meaningfully reduced the risk of isk printing from its state with local.
---
The biggest problem, obviously, is local (though cynos came a close second). Local means that you get instant, perfect, uncounterable intel about a potential threat, and that means you are absolutely guaranteed to be safe if you're paying attention to local. And guaranteed safety in nullsec, in a supposedly PVP game, is death to the game.
---
there's no clear meaning in "two-sided coin", and that was the point. take it like you have a pair and move on.
---
It is, because of their activity. By essence big fleets don't require permanent turtling as they have to be answered with an equivalent one and are seen way before they even reach your space.
---
I don't blame them, just stating the obvious fact. You don't try to protect your ratting ship for something else than solo guys and smallgangs (unless you're in a ratting super and they have blops/dreads at range, but w/e).
---
&gt; And taking away local doesn't "make it better for the 10 man group than it does for the bloc." 
---
It obviously does, else they wouldn't all be saying it's the best thing that ever happened to Eve according to them. And if you fail to see why, you have an issue.
---
In fact i got a cool idea. We can take local out of hi sec and make it have sites that only drop loot no bounties and add drifters. Low sec can have sov and local. Null sec should have faction warfare and local and wormholes should have concord.
---
A PvP server isnt the same as the game is PvP. WoW has PvP servers but its hardly accurate to call it a PvP game. 
---
Instead you can put it like this. Will the game survive without PvP? Yes, its not really needed. Will the game survive without PvE? No cause everything is interconnected and without ships to fly there cant be any PvP.
---
So it is a PvE game. But will it be fun without PvP? Na, the game would be a farming simulator and well shit.
---
Remember when it was widely accepted that Eve was a universe and society sandbox in which PvP, PvE, economic, and cooperative elements were inextricably intertwined, and no man was an island? I remember.
---
We won't ever get that, so let's focus on battles we can maybe have a tiny chance to actually win.
---
Lmao, the game would not survive without PvP. There would be nobody buying the shit you mine.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/btl3z8/ideas_on_improved_lowsec_and_npc_null/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share. I actually posted this a long time ago . Which was basically an idea to integrate PvP into pve and a way to move LP with the idea of loyalty to an NPC corp. Also ppl think this will make ppl not undocked. But when a structure mechanism is to self repair without anyone on grid why should aggressors waste time as well . It was one of things I put in.
---
Gallente activity against Caldari seems to be heating up lately.
---
I explained how to use it as an hunter or in a navigation objective, because it is so easy to use it this way.
---
So then, please explain us how to use Dotlan/Internal Map at a defensive way against wormholers and solo/small groups while ratting or farming.
---
I don't see the connection. 
---
You think that because we at 50% of bounties from previous months, magically multiplying it by 2 will do the trick ?
---
That's kinda nonsensical.
---
How many "delayed local" threads do we need here?  The mods should merge them.
---
Holy crap dude. You've got issues.
---
'Blame' doesn't come into it.  I'm just observing a difference between then and now.
---
No, everybody going ape-shit, and un-subbing while going ''RRREEEEEEE, because they cant rat in there titans or supercapitals,  is effecting the health of the game.  Those players have all put CCP in the position where they can't fix the game in its current state.
---
Jump clone and go to an area of high sec not inhabited by hostile parties.  Everyone hangs out at the big hubs so you are just asking for trouble if you think you can roam around there and not catch trouble.
---
Admittedly my interaction with hi sec these days is to go to my private dacha, pull out a gank fit nado and randomly ruin someone's day.  But I did see plenty of people from Null running around the more rural areas of hi sec with no problems.
---
Its the Rorq man. If that goes many many of our issues will go away. It needs to be a booster so remove excavs and just allow one sieged Rorq per cluster. This will force it to become what it was meant to be, a support ship and not the premier mining ship (but reimburse people having them, atleast a portion of its value).
---
And if alliances dont need to expend resources on defending Rorqs then much of the other stuff will fall away I reckon.
---
classificate wormholes  to secure wormholes,dangerous wormholes.. secure wormholes = only police ships no concord. dangerous wormhole = you can pray for quick death from smartbomb machariel.
---
yeah like wtf pirat never undocks at all , no idea how they have top 10 recent alliance rank ??? anyone
---
I remember!
---
Which would only show him to people that saw him speak. If you leave system and return, local should be empty until someone speaks again.
---
&gt; You guys had your chance
---
? You think I designed and implemented blackout?
---
You are arguing that the wave would somehow end.
---
&gt;Why does CCP cave into the demands of PVE'ers everytime and not PVPers. 
---
Because the other group pays the bills
---
I don't know, chilling and getting ganked by 10 invisible psycopaths you can have no prior warning about it's kinda not possible.
---
You intentionnally ignore that you cannot ever survive against a small gang unless you fly a capital/supercapital. You will be dead way before anyone can try and save you.
---
After that you need to try to bait someone you're not even sure is still in system, cause cloaks.
---
Anyway I don't think you're seriously trying to discuss anything, so I don't even see the point.
---
You sure as shit promoted it.
---
Or (and i know this is radical thinking but please stay with me here), you let people play the way they enjoy?
---
1. Use the regional tab on zkill to show you who the most active people hunting in your area is.
---
2. Look at their information and what they are flying.
---
3. Use dotlan to figure out what the hotspot ratting systems are and use something else.
---
You know that is if it's too hard to click warp or light a cyno and have supers stream in to save you.
---
Fair enough. I think I misunderstood your point but chose not to delete the post.
---
&gt; At no point should you gain boosts from a ship that is not currently on grid.
---
100% correct.
---
Dude says: 
---
&gt; Removal of OGBs impacted small gangs on a vastly larger scale than it impacted blobs. 
---
100% correct. 
---
I don´t see the issue here.
---
The Abysal 1v1 room is kind of like this, no?
---
PvEers would do it. You can build a KS in every system if you want. You can build the Palatine. You overestimate PvPers ability to actually impact things.
---
Really? Where?
---
Big fleets are irrelevant unless they hit your structures. Nobody can maintain a huge enemy fleet in your space without content. In the past we had food supplies to keep people on the field longer. In Eve we have "fun" that needs to be done. Take a 100 man fleet and accomplish nothing a few times and see those numbers dwindle.
---
They had a plan they just didn’t expect the players to unsub at the rate they have been doing.
---
Asset safety is a bad design for kspace and just plain stupid in jspace
---
Buh bye.
---
How about a pernament bounty like thng on everyone? You kill someone you get x % of thier ships worth and this is not tied with bounty so you could get player set bounty plus some iskies for killing someone
---
but it checks out
---
You over estimate the amount of wrinkles in your brain.
---
Didn't start getting really widespread until a few years later.
---
This is what I thought
---
&gt;CCP aren't sure what direction to now go.
---
If CCP arent sure what direction that they can now go, thats very fucking concerning.
---
Arguments are moot, people are mute.
---
Nicely done
---
Maybe those PvErs that quit were the small guys.  Sometimes quietly walking away is the loudest sound you can make.
---
There were so many cool things that you could do to fuck with big alliances and yet CCP removed them all and made everything even safer. and people for some reason blame the big alliances when they just use the tools that CCP gave them.
---
You don't get the point, do you ?
---
You got free kills on krabs that were probably not attentive enough, I believe in the same system, the first being a total no match with you being cloak and people having no ability to see you coming except watching gates entrance 24/7 because cloak is balanced.
---
Maybe they weren't on comms because they didn't wish to ? Maybe they were just idiots that are in their alliance just for krabbing and don't care about others ? Or maybe it was three times the same guy and he was afk ? You'll never know. If it was the same guy, you would have killed him with local too, near2 doesn't help when you're not on your computer.
---
You cannot take an example to prove a theory, it never worked like that and never will. You have to take all the facts, all the data and prove it.
---
The recent events sadly prove that probably most people are either so risk and effort averse that they simply stopped login in, or maybe it was simply not worth it ?
---
&gt; the most glorious shitposting
---
Maybe I do need to join a corp.
---
That's what is concerning is I havent registered. I guess I will just keep an eye on my gmail account. Thanks!
---
It was always based on the idea that PVP would be the foundation of everything. That changed along with its player base
---
Well,  you can have the dankest 120m+ ticks,  but a super loss is still going to be painful.  And the question is not if but when you'll lose it.
---
This is why people would watch netflix and chill while they PVE. Take away the option to have fun while doing something really boring in the game and of course people start to quit.
---
edit: This is why i starting doing reactions as my sole isk generating activity, a) it can be exciting move a ton of isk worth of materials through space, and b) I can just let it sit and cook while im off doing other fun things.
---
Do please do it
---
It is, but it's borked because of 2 issues:
---
1) Running the initial abyssal site requires like a 2b isk cruiser. Unless the site can pay out 5b on a combat victory, it's not worth risking the duel. (iirc you'll be lucky to clear 250m + the other dude's loot.) We need something where you can reliably make a profit even if you only survive at an average rate, and preferably with a sub-200m buyin for people who don't wanna risk billions up front. 
---
2) Problems with instanced PvP in Eve: if you know you're doing a cruiser 1v1 you can fit a ship that, say, has so much passive regen it's impossible for any cruiser to break it. Any sort of mandatory 1v1 has this problem; **PvP in Eve normally has a lot of balance-by-asymmetry,** where the counter to a guy in an officer fit ship is to bring two t1-fit ships and a falcon. A 1v1s-only round would probably quickly be dominated by elitist pilots in maxbling ships. I'd rather have a "free arena" where you drop 10 dudes into a large complex/labyrinth and let them duke it out; individuals can choose to avoid fights and try to evac with some loot, hunt other pilots, etc. And if you go in with a 5bil megabling boat you can't guarantee you won't get ganged up on by 3 randos and killed. We'd have to solve the teaming problem (or just embrace it and run a teams mode) but that's easier than balancing pure guaranteed 1v1s.
---
Sounds like people should adapt or die.
---
plus a good flair bait :p
---
That wasn't risk/reward balancing. That was yoloing an easy coding that required no dev time and hoping it would be the glob of shit that actually sticks to the wall.
---
Tweaking anom respawns, barring supercaps from anoms, adjusting anoms so they are good to run in a pvp-ish fit ship, scaling ore belt rat spawns based on the ships present and giving them tackle, nerfing asset safety, tweaking moons, etc. Those would be balancing of risk/reward.
---
The tunings you list didnt fix a problem, and instead of further tuning until fixed, CCP just stopped like they tend to do and started grasping at unrelated jesus features.
---
What needs balancing? Some combination of cluster-wide risk/reward, citadel tether and timers and asset safety, and unlimited resource availability (especially in null) would be a good start, besides minor number tuning on many hulls and modules.
---
*vile shitlords
---
Yeah maybe you are being willfully ignorant but I'm talking about capital application to subcaps which is broken. If you have something to say on *this topic* I'm all ears.
---
Isnt this how this already works? A x16 skill takes that much more SP per level to train than an x2 skill. 
---
So that should scale even more for applying SP?
---
If going by the sheer definition of PVP, it would count, but i know what you mean.
---
Ya, but hey, a man can dream. :)
---
r/im14andthisisdeep
---
Im not going through your post history. But I sure as shit know you werent willing to compromise. According to you. But it doesnt even matter. Did your group say these things or not?
---
Oh we sure as shit gave tons of suggestions. Nobody was listening. Thats what all the "stop with the heavyhanded nerfs and give us good changes" was all about. 
---
Youre not getting rid of local. Thats a fact, it got tried and it got kicked. End of story. Its not perfect and you being safe if you pay attention is exactly how it should be. I dont get what the alternative is? You play the game correctly and you still get punished? Why the fuck would people agree to that? Thats what you dont get. I get that afk can go but I will never agree to people who put in effort should be caught. 
---
This is not a PvP game. This is a PvE game. You can remove PvP from the game but you cannot remove PvE. Thats a fact. The sooner you start accepting this the sooner better solutions can be conjured. You need PvEers but the game wont be fun without PvP so its highly recommended that they are around aswell.
---
Now work with these prereqs and you will quickly understand why the blackout would never work. And why the cyno change is also shit and will most likely also be reverted or heavily iterated on.
---
Is there a middleground? Sure as shit, alot of suggestions have been given in the past months. But none of them will work as long as its only one group, us, promoting them. You guys straight shut down any form of cooperation because you thought this would last so you didnt bother to see the whole picture. 
---
That changes that we can all agree on are more likely to get implemented and work than onesided changes.
---
I don't know how great a job they did at hiding it... Chat channels aren't even working atm.
---
Didn't they say months ago that they would revert to the old system if they didn't find a solution?
---
That's sadly the state of Eve where you have no way to get content that is not completely boring (citadel bash, gates bash, cyno bash, whatever bash, entosis).
---
That's CCP's fault and job to fix this mess, blackout was ironically one of the worst content driver for nullbloc warfare (because good luck scouting in blackout).
---
Nullsec blocs are tired of structures bash warfare, with gazillions timers and people blueballing most of them. It isn't content, it's a chore, a necessary one sometimes, but still a chore.
---
Good talk brother.
---
Okey dude.
---
I made this suggestion in CSM 12 &amp; 13, with the argument of both gameplay benefits, and also the increase in fairness around internet speed. CCP was not interested in discussing changing local in any regard at that time unfortunately, but I think you could also have some fun with a flat delay, so groups of fast moving ships (Interceptors/Bombers/Destroyers) could "Stay ahead" of local and not show up, whilst retaining it as a more strategic intel tool/social indicator. 
---
I know a lot of people kibosh any point that comes out of The Mittani's mouth, but I think what he talked about in his Fireside with regards to seeing that there are people around you geographically - even if only friendly ones are shown - is something that contributes positively to Nullsec.
---
The worst part about the complete blackout repeal isn't being harder to hunt/roam, it's that without so much as a middle ground between perfect instant intel and blackout, they caved to carebears and the crying masses who's small leadership group told them CCP was out to get them.
---
But people can easily just blap them according to you
---
//So I had a wet brain fart in the shower... 
---
this is it.
---
I think the blackout was a GOOD change, at least it was interesting to experiment with. The cyno change is dumb and just causes tedium and monotony. I'd be fine with a middle ground on blackout, but they should roll the cyno changes back. They are mondo bad.
---
This.  Citadels ruined this game.  And there is literally nothing they can do about it now.  The genie is out of the bottle.
---
PvEers before blackout: ADAPT OR DIE MOTHERFUCKERS
---
PvEers during blackout: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
PvEers after blackout: ADAPT OR DIE MOTHERFUCKERS
---
We've seen your posting, we know you are 14.
---
I know you've seen it, but have you *seen* it, for what it truly is?
---
You think there is balance when they are as safe as high sec while making 10x the isk?
---
"Good luck scouting in blackout." That's exactly the lazy entitled attitude that fills nullsec right now. I was excited for black out because suddenly your scouts matter a whole lot more. F1 mashing is boring for me. But for nullkrabs even this is too difficult to do. Most people just seem to want to follow FC warp, anchor on FC, press F1 on target. Like I wrote in the OP, our player demographic has shifted from combat focused pvp types to entitled krabs that see pvp as a nuisance.
---
glasshouse
---
No idea what you are talking about, being -3 you were safe from other players, because it was a PIRAT Phobus that pointed him.
---
Yeah idk what they are going to do. It worked before the changes but put more stress on the game servers. Spamming local with a full fleet could literally lag people to disconnect from the game lol. So a separate system is much needed.
---
Cyno and super / Titan fleet coming? Are you goon / test / WC? Because other alliances don't do that lol.
---
7Bil fitted hel? We don't play the same game?
---
They appreciate the game is dying but fixing it could kill it quicker. They are a company with a bottom line and if the player base don’t support them then they have few options available to them
---
Thing is, it was clearly stated and reiterated that the blackout was a test. Now was CCP way too biased and expressed said bias on numerous occasions? Yes, they fked up on the PR side of things cause they clearly wanted certain things that would never come to fruition. 
---
But it was a test. I agree that CCP needs to convey plans and thoughts better, I love road maps personally and it allows us to feel excited over whats coming. I would much rather that becomes more commonplace and detailed than reddit posts.
---
But it was a test. People assumed way too much and most should have understood that it wouldnt last when the PCU went into freefall. You cant blame CCP for player delusion levels being all time high blaming the drop from bots to school season. We as players have a responsibilty to behave somewhat mature as well.
---
Tbh, the only good thing that came out of citadels were supers being able to dock. But everything else about citadels were bad. I felt the game took a complete 180 when they launched. Made wormholes stagnant, you can undock and sit on the citadel and not give a care in the world. But there is no chance of them fixing citadels.
---
Too lazy to watch the video, but the best way is to extract and refine the most basic element. 1 per planet and then move it all to another planet for production. I did this with 2 characters, 10 planets and made some good income with Integrity Response Drones.
---
I mean, I'll refer you to the comment I made to other replies, but the reality is that for *you* (and tbh me when I played), making isk funds the thing that's fun for you. There is, however, a subset of players who find that mind numbing (for us) stuff fun. Those players can run more simultaneous accounts than we do when we're pvp'ing, even if the most hardcore of pvp'ers (at least back in the day) probably had more active accounts than the majority of krabs. That means that not only have CCP's actions catered to those players more and more, but those players are more financially valuable to ccp, so on multiple fronts, they're now at the mercy of players who have found fulfillment in making isk primarily.
---
&gt;Blackout did  
---
&gt;Constellation / regional chat would  
---
&gt;Delaying local by a few minutes would

&gt;Removing names and just showing total people in system would
---
\- So blackout, which didn't work.
---
\- Sure, so people start docking once anyone enter constellation or region that isn't a known JF alt/exploration bot. Way to go to have even more people in space.
---
\- I don't get it, numbers alone =&gt; So blackout, which didn't work. Seeing only standings only remove some intel (zkill paste) and doesn't change a damn thing.
---
Think a little.
---
Remove covert cloaks
---
When did I say that lmao what are you talking about?
---
This. Near2 is only one way, there will always be another way to share intel inside groups. And I prefer near2 which is not fail-proof (people not reporting, and that happens A LOT) than intel bots on gates automatically reporting neuts entering system on every channel on Earth.
---
Hunting by implication is asymmetrical combat. Asymmetrical combat is boring. I would rather watch netflix while i mine than spend 2 hours trying to find a covetor or ratting domi to kill. There is just no point, its boring AND it isn't making me isk, so why bother. I would rather roam in like a battleship/maurader/BC solo / small gang and have fun by actually being engageable and getting GFs.
---
There are so many changes that need to be made that the playerbase has been saying for years now. Its not like they have ZERO options. They just dont know how to balance the game, they only know extremes.
---
Panfam, GOTG, Legacy, Imperium, basically covers the majority of nullsec.  
---
You can get a cheap fit hel pretty easy in a nullbloc.
---
Don't forget the faction bs hulls that are actually worse than the t1 hulls because "balance". Also there is, its called a Nestor :P . BS just need a buff across the board
---
I do this with 5 characters, yes I am a masochist.
---
Useful.
---
7B? Come on. Check contracts before saying random numbers. Even hulls at cheapest are not 10B. And I'm part of legacy, capital drop is the last solution we have if we cant fight with subcaps
---
I'm a quite new player (2 years old) and I'm also very sad because I start to understand how things works, I saw ccp tried something with the blackout but so many dude just started bitching... I really think the game is not dangerous anymore, too safe, nobody wants to fight, every body seems to just want to farm to build ship they will never dare to commit
---
Sad.
---
Machs are a battle cruiser doctrine, change my mind.
---
Yes, i definitely agree. Not only the turbo krabs leaving, but also all of the pvp'ers who decided its not worth it to keep those 3 or 4 mining alts around anymore and unsub them.
---
Afk brings a good game; in j and k space. Nicely done!
---
Ok, so you are telling us that people should migrate all the time when the situation requires it, a few like animals in reality when there are too much predators in a specific ecosystem. Yes, I said people, because I wouldn't be the only one to do that.
---
And so when the hunters will see that we migrated in the neighboring constellation as it will require them only minutes to find out with the map, they will come and so we have to repeat the moving barges and others ships process again and again which requires HOURS to do. That will amplify the Citadel Proliferation as we will need all necessary installations everywhere, if not make people leave at the end.
---
And this don't compensate the fact that hunters can use the internal map to get systems of interest with a delay of 30 minutes if not immediatly (using ADM) with only minutes of processing, while your solution requires days of waiting or days of corpmate feedbacks to get usable statistics, and a serious amount of logistics.
---
And it don't give a way to compensate Terran wormholers activities.
---
Your solution is doable, but it is not a game at this point. It is also not enough and definitively NOT FUN for the targetted ones.
---
Don't ask others to do what you would refuse to do yourself.
---
I really hope that &gt; IF &lt;  CCP do a "Blackout v2" one day, that they will remove the intel of EVERYONE. Only then will it be fair enough.
---
I can understand what they were trying to achieve. it was defiantly needed. 
---
I'm not a technical person in any way but its been well over a year and I kind of expected this to be fixed a year ago.
---
The issue wasnt due to cloaky campers. They actually became less of an obvious threat. Rather everyone became a cloaky camper. Thats the issue. Before it was only a handful of individuals that would camp entire regions but the blackout gave everyone the chance to become "invisible". And people took it too the max by just going cloaky ships and doing stupid shit like bombing excavators all the time. Whilst saying they only want good fights.
---
You cant have it both ways. You cant be destructive in a "pad my KB" way and yet argue that you want the BO cause it gives good fights. If people really wanted a fair change then they shouldnt all have gone cloaky ships and bombed the shit out of shit that doesnt really make any sense outside of griefing. Its the griefing aspect that drove people away, just in the same way that the retention rates are shit. The difference is however that we could right away see the reductions in players due to the BO but we cant really see it amongst new players.
---
So tldr: anything that will allow for more griefing will backfire. Anything without proper counters will backfire. People will not accept paying to play for a game in which they merely are content for others. And as soon as CCP understands this and starts making changes in HS accordingly we will get better retention rates.
---
Like the tedium of gating 30 jumps?
---
Blackout was good, fuck them and their reversal
---
I concur. Do they get so much hate because they are a war deccer corp that targets noob corps or is it something else I'm not getting?
---
No one wants to play an outdated MMO in an era when MMOs are dying. There are no new MMO players to draw to Eve or anything else. The next generation of gamers will all be quickmatch e-sports type games while they suck down their monster and tweet their insignificant thoughts, or post them on reddit much like this.
---
Wasn't the whole model of nullsec originally supposed to be that you fight to hold space, and the winners hold the space and therefore get isk passively? eg. Money moons of the old days. This isn't what's happening, because there's so much space that anyone who wants some has it, all space is basically equal, and the isk-making is (relatively) active, in the form of mining and ratting, not passive. So the barrier to isk making in nullsec is not the ability to pvp successfully, it's the willingness to pve for lots of hours.
---
If you are talking about trade goods/and rig components you are correct. However, there are multiple regions that have every single moon goo, yes there is a weighting system depending on the space you live in. but all are available in various quantity's for the most part.
---
I like the idea of not showing until you break invul
---
Politicians use single point data all the time.
---

---
&gt; Killing npcs (mining?) raises it, killing players/player structures/dying lowers it.
---
This works out one of two ways: either A. it's possible to lose a cheap ship (value X) and then reap rewards of &gt;X in increased ratting income, or B. it isn't.
---
In case A, people just abuse it by killing eachother with their out-of-corp alts to keep the bounties high, then they dock up when pvp comes because they are already reaping the rewards of the new system.
---
In case B, nothing changes from the status quo. Hardcore bears know they won't win against the elite pvp roam in their space, so why bother undocking just to lose on net? They'll leave sooner if you blueball them.
---
I still think tying ratting's "straight to isk" reward is a bad idea.
---
Remember when rogue drones dropped alloys? Those alloys then needed to be either sold or refined into minerals then sold. Those resources then went into production of new stuff in industry. I'd propose moving more into a loot and salvage mechanic.
---
With the new cyno changes, it further encourages local industry instead of shipping it all the way to Jita and back. For bots it creates more actions raising the bar, for newbies in corps it creates new low entry roles (salvage and hauling behind ratters), and for PvPers it creates more rewards for hunting.
---
wew got got them for 7 in ncdot. In any case it's irrelevant if it's 7 or 10 or whatever. Point is they're stupidly cheap because of how easy mining is now.
---
"We drop caps as last resort." Do you tho...
---
So basically “ultra crabs” did what you want them to do (quit) and they are to blame for that? Are you serious? 🤔
---
Most of those bots switched to higsec mission runners.  There was a large spike in mission rewards and highsec rat bounties this last month.
---
So why don't you just...I dunno...pvp them then?
---
im assuming the awnser to this is no, but has anyone ever treid a doctrine involving 2 FAXes as logi to a subcap fleet?
---
&gt;Lol really? I don't recall you making any suggestions that meaningfully reduced the risk of isk printing from its state with local.
---
I can assess a number of us did. This blackout was a shit iteration compared to what good changes could have been, and CCP paid the price for it. Damn look at the defeated face of Falcon when they announced it, they weren't happy about it. Let them think about WHY it failed.
---
We care about Eve, and while we're not on the same side we know things cannot stay forever like this. But everything is in CCP's hands.
---
&gt;The biggest problem, obviously, is local (though cynos came a close second). Local means that you get instant, perfect, uncounterable intel about a potential threat, and that means you are absolutely guaranteed to be safe if you're paying attention to local. And guaranteed safety in nullsec, in a supposedly PVP game, is death to the game.
---
It isn't. Small gangs were starved from content for years and greeted theses changes like a goddamn gift from god, ignoring the repercussions behind it, making it "THE BIGGEST PROBLEM OF EVE IS KRAB SAFETY".
---
The problems are numerous : the prime source of small gang content, lowsec, is dead. Nullsec is too safe because the different empires made it so, and they aren't waging war much because of the retarded sov system and citadel timers, so they krabs instead, with every assets at their disposition in standby to protect their farming grounds while waiting for some change in mechanics or some dumb reason to go fight someone else. Wormhole content is not that great anymore.
---
Cyno on every ships was clearly too powerful for the current state of Eve (but having in on two of the most underused, most inadapted lines of ships in Eve is clearly dumb).
---
Nullsec safety is adapted for alliance vs alliance fight, not 10 drunkards vs goliath, so that led us to the current state. Which would have been fine if lowsec wasn't dead, mind you.
---
I cant believe I am upvoting a RiotRick post, what the fuckin christ.
---
Well said, this is (among other things) why I am unsubbed.
---
That's because CCP aren't good at balance. Yes meta/counter meta will establish itself. But, some ships are laughably more relevant than others. Look at faction BS many are objectively worse than their t1 counterparts. Look at t3cs, the Proteus is a meme (outside whs because those guys are weird), and the Loki is the lord of everything.
---
PVEers consolidated and moved under close capital support, switching their rorqs to not use excavators, fleet mining, ect and on top of that subcap ratters kept going but capital ratters mostly took a break. 
---
PVPers just warped around cloaked, which they already did before hand, and still found ways to complain about less risk for easier kills. 
---
But post whatever you need to post to try and convince yourself the blackout was going to fix the problems it wasn't going to fix. I'll be mining tommorow.
---
Depends on if you're in a null corp or a wormhole corp. In a null corp, you'll probably need an out-of-corp alt. Just make your own corp and don't join an alliance or erect any structures. If you're in a wormhole corp, 99% of the time nobody's going to bother wardeccing you so you should be good.      
---
Though if you're looking for content, why not embrace the wardecs? They bring content right to you, for free!
---
you should check out [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/d48ipt/sad_truth_revealed_by_blackout/f0cuh4y/) below you. I did live in whs for a while and often day trip into whs cause they are some of the best isk/time investment when you find them. Tell me is there any other isk making opportunity in the game aside from botting that has as perfect control of who is in their system when they decide to bring out their blingy ratting ships? I understand living in whs is risky but lets not pretend that any competent whing group doesn't close their wh connections in their ratting holes.
---
Every once in a while I am smart and seed my main a ceptor or hyper-nano frig in my home school system. Just set home, die back, zoom around, create new clones, buy small stuff, and zoom home.

But munnins are the meta because carriers were too opresive for anything larger then a cruiser

---
You "piratz" are funny.
---
Lazy shitposting, quality over quantity please. If you smear shit everywhere no one ends up caring that much.
---
&gt; get out on those alts and pvp or just accept lower payouts  
---
or I can just farm some my neutral alts
---
What if **nobody** could bring an overwhelming force? What if the amount of mass that could warp (or jump) onto a grid in any 10 minute period was no larger than 200% of what's already on grid at the start of that period (or like 3 battleships' worth, whichever is larger)? Lore reason: error, navigation failure, too much warp signature pollution is present.
---
Obviously this is horribly abusable (just use up the warp quota with friendlies and the other guys can never get in), but hey, it's the start of an idea.
---
Or just make them take cap boosters.
---
CCP just proved that isn't the case
---
That doesn't really solve the crux of the issue here though.  Like I'm sure you're aware of just how many supers are ratting in our space.  Unless CCP wanted to like spawn 30 dreads in a site the increased rewards are just going to get them even more than the insane amounts they're making now.  All making sites harder would do is punish the newer ratters while leaving the caps unaffected and only boosting their income.
---
&gt;  both are good and need to be balanced.
---
Blackout was some kind of balance.
---
You have very clearly never lived in a wormhole.        
---
Stop while you're behind.
---
the fuck you on about? Small gangs kill caps all the the time in WHs and now in k space too after cyno changes. bhalgorns leshaks guardians. A 20 man fleet will totally murder a few unsupported caps. Capitals are only good when you have enough support not to get fucked. Ive killed a pvp fit carrier with 5 domis before.
---
This *has* to be a troll at this point. No way you aren't fucking around.
---
&gt; Nah, high sec is the riskiest space in all of EVE not null.
---
actually, unless piloting a retriver or a covetor, highsec is laughably safe when it comes to ganks.
---

It absolutely fucking was not, it was the opposite of balanced it was another extreme.
---
I actually really like that.
---
"nullkrabs, nullkrabs, nullkrabs". You people only have that in mind, spitting on perfectly good players that don't play the game like you want them to. Guess what, they do the same.
---
You convinced yourself Eve is full of krabs and you're one of the elite of Eve, right ?
---
You ever scouted for alliance fights ? You know how many people that required before blackout ? Please wonder of many more alts we need to even scout properly now. While big alliances have manpower, you cannot have 57 people always ready to do the FC biding 24/7, reducing the available content even more.
---
F1 mashing is boring for you ? Nullsec bloc people are mindless drones only following FC orders ? Well who the fuck cares about your opinion on how they play the game ? Play your game and stop treating people as inferior beings just because they don't like YOUR way of doing things.
---
You people just don't know how much work needs to be done by people just to keep some level of organization, you just think it happens magically like the unicorn of free killing you got gifted two months ago.
---
" For us to put them in a position where they can't try to fix the game in it's current state is upsetting.  "
---
WE the players didn't put them in any position, THEY (CCP) decided to start making rapid fire changes while ignoring feedback and telling players they are not supposed to like the changes, and hey what do you know that blew up in their face. There were plenty of things they could adjust and received wide spread support, addressing the citadel spam and related issues, finishing the ship tieracide they started and just never got around to completing, finishing any of the dozens of things they added to the game over the last decade that they promised to follow up on and never did. Instead they decided to make changes they KNEW were going to anger large parts of the player base and then outright told players "Your opinions don't matter, we know better, HTFU" That particular approach has never once ended well for a company.
---
So if there are so many better options, why do people still do it?
---
Yeah CCP uses NPC taxes etc to help offset inflation. Thats not really the issue. The issue is accessibility to larger ships and the knock on effect that has had to cap production. Rorqs only made that worse because now you can mine faster inject more and scale it up as big as you like.
---
Things i think they could do. 
---
Increase capital production costs by makimg them require PI you can offset that by making citadels require more mined minerals.
---
Rolling region wide shortages of certain ores to increase scarcity of certain minerals. 
---
Ban certain skills from being able to use free or injected SP. Cant inject capital skills for example. 
---
I cant speak for the viability of all this but i do think it needs to explored as it has been in the eve echoes alpha.
---
balance it, give them a role bonus that reduces damage taken by capital sized weapons, then Nerf their non capital ehp to what you said.
---
No sabres were harmed in the making of this reddit post.
---
What is the point of ratting if you never have to risk it? Where is the game then?
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Their financial head took a look at the figures and said "oh shit please stop this madness". They don't need Reddit for that.
---
This is why you make Eve 2: The Undocking
---
If you think eve has 2 years at this rate boy do i have some news for you
---
Because CCP boat currently has too many leaks, they needed to plug them.
---
&gt;Not true carebares used to stay in high sec.
---
Not true, my time from 2009-2013 was almost entirely spent in nullsec in what most people would consider a nullbear corp. Plenty of groups did large scale mining in null as well, it just wasn't as obvious because it was all done in hulks and barges.
---
uncontested structure bashes
---
Says the crab bitching to no end?
---
I would actually expect more targets out and about.  People will feel safe enough to undock, but much more vulnerable given the cyno changes.  
---
Time will tell.
---
Fun night!
---
I'm not talking specifically about the types of changes, I'm talking about CCP's willingness to try *anything*.
---
I wouldn't let supers/carriers into anomalies to PvE at all.
---
Yup. So many options they could try, and there can definitely be a fair balance pvp &gt; pve
---
&gt; When did I say that lmao what are you talking about?
---
You implied it before, and now you said it.
---
The only time it's "balanced" is when its as safe as HS but you make 10x the isk.
---
you're asking about an offset, doubling it would offset it from pre-blackout eve.
---
Before the gang disengaged from my rorq, I was thrilled at the content, not knowing what was going to happen, if there was escalation if help would arrive in time. Mind you my fit, while poor fit, was still correctly fit to defend itself...
---
Nergals are awesome !! Nice fleet comp.
---
Yeah. That + the fact that actual success in null isn't determined by "pvp skill" or "morale" or "dedication to the cause" anymore;^1 it's determined by "who got more titans" which itself is a direct product of "who rorqmined more". This is part of why nullsec has a conflict between PvE and PvP; if you wanna win wars, you need to rorqmine safely, and the best way to rorqmine safely is to hole up in a corner, blue the next six regions, and never fight wars.
---
1. Not that it ever was, since like 2010 or something, but rorqs made this worse
---
X16 takes 16x skill point to train for, I would apply an additional penalty on powerful high multiplier skills just to prevent them from being injected for. You can inject support/prereq skills up to like capital ship, but things like Capital ship itself, doomsday operation, JDC V, and racial titans have to be train for the normal way.
---
"obviously wrong" and tbh probably know more then most people. Whats your point? What do I not realize that i am wrong about?
---
The thing is, like pretty much every major problem feature CCP has introduced, everyone TOLD them it wasn't ready and pointed out the obvious flaws.  They just never seem to really care, are content to push out broken shit and bandaid it occasionally.  The current state of EVE is the culmination of that strategy, yet their solution is to...put more controversial bandaids while still ignoring the core problems.  Honestly, I'm not sure there's any hope of things getting better because they seem completely incapable of sitting down and actually looking at the core problems.
---
This sub has been a whirlwind recently )
---
Free intel. Free isk. Horrible balance.
---
Fuck you, you stinky krab.
---
And fuck CCP for bowing to krabs.
---
I truly think that all citadels, keepstars included, should only get a single (Up to 36 hour) timer. Similar to POS's
---
No your wrong
---
You're right, it didn't make null wormholes.  Wormholes actually have profit and mechanics to support no local, null doesn't.
---
PvPers before the blackout: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

PvPers during blackout: ADAPT OR DIE MOTHERFUCKERS

---
2008-11, right?
---
Money stopped being an issue for the large blocs a long time ago.
---
It would be cool if the end of Blackout was the introduction of something new, rather than just back to the old stagnation we had.
---
Fuck you krab
---
I was one of those two deacons who didn't get booshed and when I saw their entire group redbox me I thought I was dead. Thanks Cap and 34m sig radius!
---
No its not balanced on either side lmao they are both extremes. Stop reading into things when you cant read.
---
* Delayed hotdrops by requiring that we light a covert cyno to bring in a recon to light the real cyno, then bring back local so the targets get warning that you're coming. Delayed warning, sure, but as soon as "hotdropper so-and-so" appears in intel they're all going to dock up, just like the old days. You've got 10 minutes to find your target, get set up, and light the cyno. Use it well.
---
* Changed all mining to capital ships that have an invulnerability window to give the defenders time to ping a super fleet to drop on you.
---
* Nerfed the VNI so that ratters are pushed into either DED sites (which is an okay change) or carrier/super ratting (which, combined with the above cyno/local changes, is very definitely *not*).
---
* Put an instant safe spot in every system (citadel tethering) so that your enemies can warp off and be untouchable if they don't like the odds or the fight isn't going their way.
---
* Introduced Assault Damage Controls that give HACs and AFs the ability to be damn near invulnerable long enough for logi to catch them, making those the dominant ships for both fleet fights and a lot of small gang.
---
* FAXes. Fuck them and whoever came up with the idea.
---
* Introduced jump gates that let players bypass the isolated pipes where a lot of gate camps and small gangs thrived, which are placed within range of citadel weapons, ignore jump fatigue, and allow players to use them while being tackled.
---
Dont do it.
---
CCP is a clueless company with no long term plan, and the game is slowly droping off.
---
Discouraging ratting and mining does not encourage pvp. They are two different things.
---
Well yes, that's what I meant when I said I didn't want to haul ass to shoot someone's ratter.
---
This is a balanced view. I supported blackout because I am a PVPer through and though. But I have to acknowledge that it must have been hurting CCP too much.
---
So I don't know what the answer is but it is somewhere in the middle.
---
luckily [i have protection from this sort of stuff](https://i.imgur.com/yXEiYQ4.jpg)
---
Are you asking me why people behave in a certain manner? Usually because its the simplest route to achieve a certain goal. Said goal differs from person to person. 
---
Basically, because people prefer it over other things. Does not make it universally better which people are arguing it is. Its the same shit of nerfing playstyles that people on this sub seem to love. 
---
Honestly, at this point Im starting to think people just hate when others like the game and constantly want to shit on them for doing it. Cause there are no logical reasons behind most ideas.
---
And raise the risk to attract more of them because we make a glowing red circle on the map ?
---
It is always a matter of intel. At this point, only denying content for the hunter was the way to go to compensate their free intel. It wasn't hard to apply, as many left the game...
---
you see... ive been around for a few years and saw quite a bit of new eden but... despite their cool videos ive never seen bergmann.... who are these people? is anyone even supposed to know them? are they some kind of meme? i need answers!
---
Gotg could never defend anything on their own
---
Oh the list is too long.
---
How much would you like to nerf the isk making for you to consider it balanced?
---
I recognize the name but have no idea of the context..:
---
Lol you jelly I make isk and uses it to fly fun ships while your stuck in jackdaws? Karmafleet is recruiting!
---
What did they expect. r/eve has taken a shit at nearly every change CCP did with chaos with the exception of the VNI. Sure they may have taken a shot at botters ruining the game but they also took a large portion of the players out of the game as a result as well. (Dont try to argue this point. The Data is there so stfu) What I feel like CCP needs to do is to find ways that better target the botters that doesnt effect the playerbase as a whole. For example a window that pops up every 4 hours that requires you to move your mouse randomly in a box.  Another issue is one a lot of players seem to have a consistent issue that should be addressed. Citadel spam. Its horrible. Even though im in goons I still think citadels should be limited by amount or have or have a scaling debuff. Either way if CCP wanted to appease their audience they should acknowledge concerns rather than have someone higher up call the shots and replace playerbase with skins. One thing I will give to CCP though is they want to nerf the Umbrella. As nice as the umbrella is living under it and providing one for other goons to rat and mine in saftey I do feel it is overpowered. Some others may say people can still die under the umbrella its not very often. Caps and Supers hardly die under it (unless they are tick tanked retarded) The local blackout dropped playerbases everywhere across nullsec, not just under umbrella regions. What I think would be a good idea is to bring back region specific resources and increase the respawn time of anomalies and reduce the total number of anomalies per system. This wouldnt exactly destroy the umbrella but it would nerf/spread it out rather than have the entire defense fleet sit  in a system and jump to whomever. These ideas are not well thought out in the long run but this should be a type of method CCP should be striving for rather than shoot itself in the foot and watching the playerbase goes nuts. What do you guys think?
---
PS. Before you downvote me please think about the following
---
1. I addressed the issues with CCP and the playerbase
---
2. I gave a solution (although basic) to the problems described.
---
3. I gave an idea that would even hurt me (a goon pubbbie who is expert on F1.)
---
4. I still want CCP to be able to change the game and save it from a slow death.
---
And thats why they are universally loved by everyone:)
---
No believe it or not I'm a concerned player who's purely interested in the health of the game but clearly you can see that. Again bye  troll.
---
I fully agree. That's the whole problem with null. It's freaking cancerous to go to war.

---
Maybe maybe not.  Test built a Super Fleet in about 3 years by winning  initial Wars for space with capitals and even more so sub caps.  We went from like tenth in super cap strength to 2nd.
---
Yes, kill fozzie sov and make ~something else~ and then region lock... ore? How is that supposed to work? Am I supposed to like forcibly mine their ore? How do I get their ore? Trade? Trading is not fighting. I'm actually less likely to go fight the people who are my supply of.... ore. 
---
Or is it supposed to be a struggle to control all of 0.0?
---
It’s appropriate that capitals can shoot subcaps that stay on the same grid
---
Especially carriers who cannot beat anything else toe to toe. 
---
That’s balanced and the lazy don’t like it

I was never mad. I was asking questions. But go ahead and think I’m angry, carebear.
---
Well at least now that blackout is gone we can get back to the long decline of EVE. Yay?
---
That look - that's when EVE ceased to be dying and was officially confirmed as deceased. Like a chicken however, it'll keep on going for a while longer until the extremities catch up with grim reality.
---
They were a small group with grand ideas. But it didnt work out in the end. Tried to move to lowsec to fast and got their asses handed to them didnt even really put up a fight. Pen Is Out came in demanded money and they said nope we gonna leave. That's the jist of it. and then poof alliance if no more
---
I've been away for a few years. Is it true that you can jump ansiblex while tackled?
---
Sure, what is your level of acceptable losses? If I'm out in a battleship or BC or barge or whatever, how many ships should I lose a day, a week, a month, a year? 
---
If a neutral or hostile comes into my system to hunt ratters, how many times should I be able to get away and how many times should I die?
---
Yea you would need to be worried about being killed.
---
The super umbrella fleets in big alliances only respond to supers and carriers in distress, they aren't going to give a crap about someones ratting dominix or mining frigate. Local  intel gave the subcap krabs a chance to save themselves, if you look at stats on zkillboard you'll see that it's the subcap ratting and mining ships that suffered the most. Blackout didn't really affect supers and carriers that much at all
---
Yup
---
 This was part of the mail from leadership letting everyone know it was over 
---
The move was a disaster. I truely believe only 50% of you guys read mails fully. Mails that are utmost important. We lost 15b worth of ships in the first two days as everyone knew better themselves. The Bergmann name was already looked critical towards as the goal I had was seen as naive and stupid. Maybe it was. I saw it as a good way to provide content to people and bring them together which I think worked out until now.  But opportunistic people took the chance to prove the world right and followed our actions until we became a public attraction like a petting zoo where visitors get a free shot at the animals who just want to live in a confined space (in low sec.) We literally became a laughing stock and the Bergmann name with it. This isn't something you just recover from in Eve.  
---
From the very beginning to the very end I recieved numerous personal addressed threat letters from people in Eve who hated what I've build up and wouldn't let me have it.  This isn't a game anymore. This isn't fun anymore. I honestly couldn't believe how messed up some people in this game are. People who think just because it's a game, you can personally threaten someone. This combined with the need of micromaniging this alliance to keep it alive, seeing how our name was dragged through the dirt over and over again and countless entities who just want us erased made me realize that it's too late.  My vision has failed, the Bergmann Ship is sinking and everytime we try to fix those holes, two others pop open.
---
[Think again](https://i.imgur.com/JVfYbfy.png)
---
You're taking into account the pure ISK number in the whole of Eve, that's not how it works. You have to raise the payout more than that AND prevent overfarming (I don't know, tie a degressive farming buff to the player IP address, it's not like CCP is already banning for VPN use is it ?), so people would actually risk their ships for a few hours and spend the rest of the time doing something else in game with this isk.
---
Meet dave, dave thought it was a travesty that all the players were quitting because they lost their safety blanket and had to put a little effort in, however, when presented with the same thing of satisfied PVP'rs quitting and having literally the exact same effect on the game dave turns into the hypocrite all of r/EVE knows him to be.
---
Also he sucks dicks at a truck stop on sundays to help make ends meet, mainly the end of his tongue and the end of a dick.
---

---
Well obviously it would scale. Killing a newb ships would be like .0001 or whatever.  Killing a BS or something would be way more.
---
Kind of like the game? Do you think the trajectory of the last few years is healthy? Change is clearly needed.
---
You weren't. Everyone else was. It doesn't make sense to examine one without the other in this game.
---
Link your zkill and we can see who's the bigger carebear lulz
---
bring back the old days with no warp to zero... and maby remove the ability to make bookmarks in a ceartain range of jump gates so we dont get the shit from old days.
---
Because the last few years of safety have driven away the latter. The decline started long before blackout. Change is clearly needed.
---
Alright, so these points don’t strike me as specific to PvE players but, I am seeing a pattern in what everyone has said so far: Supers and Capitals having an impossibly powerful fleet that can just appear, and then run back to safety. There’s no good way to do it, but by the way everyone talks, the only way to get eve back to a PvP game where people get into fights is to get rid of Supers and Capitals. Delete them, give the owners isk and return all the SP specific to those ships and be done with it. It’s not fair and it would piss a lot of people who worked hard, waited, or spent RL money to skill into and/or buy them, but Capitals and Supers are what is killing Eve, not players (they’re using the tools they have to get ahead) not play styles (you get the Capitals from the ore and materials PvE players mine).
---
I would remove rorq mining completely and remove names in local but keep player count.
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't be able to shoot subcaps. I'm saying that their respective application to each class is greater than a polarized Serpentis ship with void at 0. A non-pvp fit ratting nid does more dps to a cruiser than a polarized vigi at 0 and more to a battleship than a polarized vindi at 0. 
---
That's not balanced that's just retarded.
---
Here some details for those that want to read it..... 
---
**@everyone** Bergmann Empire: End Of The Line.  Ho, Berglets.  After much internal debate, assessment of the Alliance, what we did right/wrong and with valuable input from our diplomatic allies we have decided to close down the Alliance.   I know this isn't the news you wanted to hear. It's not the news I wanted to give either. But managing the Alliance has become too much for leadership. Several CEOs and other members have already been chewed up and spat out over how much micromanaging ended up being needed. Up to and including Jon who had been working himself sick trying to keep every running. We've lost a lot of good people and the remainder have hit a point where they needed to reassess whether or not this was even fun for them anymore and whether or not it had begun to affect their real lives. The answers were no and yes, respectively.  Before I get into the next steps I want to do a kind of post mortum on this whole experience.  First of all; This wasn't any one person's mistakes or actions that brought us to this point. It was a collection of circumstances beyond our control alongside things not functioning as they should within the Alliance itself. There was little we could have done about all of Low Sec coming to put a foot in our ass for having the "nerve" to bring a "high sec" corp to low sec. It was a storm we ultimately weathered better than was expected of us and in the end we are managing to get out with the major assets we put in. Our Fortizar is being unanchored and our cap fleet was not lost. Our only damage to the Alliance itself was the loss of a Raitaru.
---
**@everyone** Second of all; Despite how this ended up neither I nor anyone else in leadership regret having tried. I am still proud of the work I put into this Alliance and and don't regret any of it. Even if it ultimately was not sustainable it was still time well spent and I will look back on it fondly. I hope you will all be able to do the same either now or at some point in the future.   I understand there will be hard feelings over this. From the results we got from the survey there were to be hard feelings no matter what decision we made. There are also, admittedly, hard feelings on some of leadership's side as well. Neither side's feelings on this matter are invalid. It's the nature of the beast and of having a social group this large. There will always be differing opinions and motivations. There is no way to please everyone.
---
**@everyone** Third of all; I have heard some the comments and complaints about leadership. Typically pertaining to a percieved lack of communication or a lack of content after we were essentially put under siege by our various neighbours. I apologize for this and would like to explain the other side of the coin here. The overall situation required a tremendous amount of work behind the scenes for leadership. The more things happened the more time we had to devote to them and the less time we had to try and play with you all. The more time we had to devote to not playing the less we wanted to log in in the first place. As the moment we did we were inevitably bombarded with everyone else's problems. Leaving no room for our us to just have fun ourselves.   It was an unsustainable situation and, ultimately, simply sucked.   From leadership's perspective the move to Low Sec was an unending headache. No matter how hard we tried to get people to listen and use basic EVE common sense there were some people who kept on ignoring us. Losing a wince inducing amount of ships in the process. These are rudimentary basics of EVE and we tried everything we could to get people to pay attention. Yet some persistently did not. No matter how hard we tried some cats refused to be herded. Even if it meant wandering off into traffic.
---
**@everyone** As we tried to reorganize things and get things running smoother we also had people who persistly bucked our attempts. I created Internal Affairs for example to help manage our HR and get people to come to me with things so that I could filter them and get them to the right people. But despite my best efforts some corp members would still routinely go around me and directly email or message Jon with minor problems that could easily be handled by their own CEOs. Or even just by asking in Bergchat.   This is also partially our fault. Jon is a big ol' softy and the Alliance was built on an idea of folks being largely free to do what they wanted. When in truth we should have begun handing out some warnings and taking action over people that were becoming a problem to us or to other corp members. There were buttholes both within and without that we needed to content with.   Please understand I don't mean everyone when I talk about these things. I don't even mean the majority. But a few persistent frustrations can take up a lot of time and energy if they're determined enough. I am not trying to blame anyone or everyone. I am just trying to explain some of leadership's side of things so you have a better understanding of just what is going on overall.
---
What mechanic do you have against cloakies that cannot be seen by dscan and that don't appear in local ? None.
---
Watching gates ? You cannot be here 24/7.
---
**@everyone** But, I digress. I'm sure everyone has 100 questions ( and 99 of them will be emailed to me or sent to me on Discord in the next hour ). The most important question you're going to ask is what happens now?  Well, here's what happens now. The Bergmann Empire will be winding down for the next week. After which point it will close and Jon will resign as Emperor. Everyone will be removed and the corps turned back over to Jon's alts. During that week, those who want to leave for whatever greener pastures they see are welcome to do so. Many of our leaders also wish to step down and return to just playing the game itself without all the stress.  That aside, we will be setting up a new corporation ( not an entire Alliance this time ). This corporation will be based in a High Sec system but on the border of Low Sec Faction Warfare. In order to cater to both playstyles or just for people who like to pew pew but don't want to live in pew pew 24/7. It will have a small industrial base for indy guys with structures held in a holding corp to avoid war decs. While the pvp/pve guys can do their thing on whichever side of the border they perfer. Trig fleets will return as a source of ISK. We may even set up a dedicated pvp corp branch that enters into Faction Warfare itself so that we have some clear allies and enemies in FW space. While making some ISK off FW loyalty points.(edited)
---
**@everyone** The purpose of this corp will be two fold: First, it will be a restructure / regroup for the members that wish to apply to it. Second, it will be in part focused on training and getting people pvp experience so that they're next move to Low Sec won't be quite as harsh of a wake up call.  This corporation will focus on establishing itself and building both isk and experience. With no timeline nor obligations to move anywhere. That will remain so until such a time as people are good and ready to do something else and only if they want to do something else.  It is our hope by doing things this way and investing in setting up these new corporations that we can offer an enjoyable option to as many people as we can as the Alliance shuts down. Based on the survey results we can't please everyone. But this is the best of all the worlds we can provide. The new corp will be built on the lessons we learned from this whole experience.  All that said, not everyone will be coming with. The Alliance right now has a fair amount of dead weight, inactive people and even a few spies. I would ask that you only apply to the new corp if you're actually looking to help the corp and be active. Not just show up now and then to free ride some ISK and hope other people do fun things for you. We can't keep being responsible for everyone else's entertainment all the time. You don't need to sit around and wait for an FC to show up in order to go out and do something.   Also no spaiz plz.
---
**@everyone** I say this all because our engagement levels were not what they needed to be to live in Low Sec. Even this weekend when I offered SRP for pvp only a meager handful of you took me up on that offer. I likewise had to cancel a major fleet op for tonight because not enough people were interested in going out and pew pewing stuff. Obviously, we can't survive living in low full time like that. We need to go back to the drawing board and build a better pvp core if we ever want to try this again.  ( Seriously though, no spaiz plz ).   Anyway, that is the basic plan going forward right now. Further details on the new corp will be forthcomining in the next day or two as we start to get things set up. But I'm sure you still have 99 questions left and I will try to answer as many as I can over the weekend.   Welp free o7, - STV

**@everyone**  Hello you old Bergers       So this has come as a shock to some of you, and to some maybe not so much. We all have a feeling that we’ve let Jon down on his dream. At least I know I have felt this way now for a few weeks. This is truly hard for me to take in as someone that has worked closely with Jon since I joined.  I have annoyed him from day one. I will say I see him now, more as a true friend in Eve than just my Alliance CEO.  With this annoncement, we are moving on and going to try to do something a little different. Onasha Katr and I have started a new corporation “Of Tears and Isk”, this will be your new home if you choose to follow us on this new chapter. There will be some of you that wish to leave and go do your own stuff. We understand and wish you the best and thank you for your time. Some we hope will join us and move on with this new start. Some will not be welcome.  We have lots of dead weight dragging us down, and even some of you that need to take a long hard look and check their ways of playing. This as you might have gathered, is just my opinion, but I am sticking to it.  We are taking this new corp to a High sec home and will live next door to a FW low sec system. We hope by doing this that you see this as a chance to unite both main playstyles within one corp. This will give you the ability to mine, rat and pew pew, all nearby and without too much hassle. A Raitaru and an Athanor will be placed and set up for low cost research-copies, along with moon chunk, ore and Ice reprocessing.  I’m delighted to announce that Onasha and Arko have taken this new challenge onboard and will be assisting in leading this new corp. They will help with training everyone in preparation for greater things to come. This will all be explained in due course.  So without further ado, please join me in Berg chat on TS3 and I will try and field any questions you might have.  I look forward to taking the next steps with some of you.  G5
---
Yup. I won in 2016, came back for a couple weeks of blackout and dipped again. Honestly think that'll be my last go at it unless something drastic happens (e.g. Universe reboot with a coherent design revamp). Unfortunately I think the interested forces are more likely to sell the IP and be done with it since decision makers no longer have a de facto interest in the game's design philosophy, but an investor interest in ROI
---
Good for "the game"? The game is just a thing. There are only 2 big groups here: the people who play the game and the people who run the game. If CCP wants to kick out all the ratters and have a game of 10k or less people playing "the right way", great, it's their game. If CCP wants to make more money by letting people rat away all day and not shoot anybody, who cares, they make their money. 
---
I'm sorry the game doesn't seem to be funded by hardcore PvPers. They are a business and will do what they can to make money.
---
[How about](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71%2BhOOt1p7L._SY606_.jpg)
---
You bad bad person..
---
;)
---
I stand by my thoughts that anyone with an actual vision left CCP years ago.  Like, 5+ years ago.
---
Some people obviously like doing that. I personally don't, but some people do and there are apparently a lot of them.
---
if you're wrong, then we are wrong, and they are wrong, then I am right! ..no wait
---
You're joking but... I stopped a few shady pilots in our coalition came to my corps home dead end system. The pilots mentionned were insanely far from where their alliance lives. Now maybe they were ban, but after local is back, I'm so calling my senator. And report them again maybe? Should I? 
---
Idk much about bots but those two are fishy as hell.
---
I dont know if its possible to learn it past a certain age. Think you need to have been dropped in the toilet headfirst as a baby. And a couple of flushes to ensure oxygen deprivation kicks in.
---
They've made it clear that there's no cohesive plan.  Years of bandaids is their plan, apparently.  The sad part is that people (including them it seems) are actually surprised when it blows up in their face.
---
Thats some good shit
---
It was really hairy there for a second, but I'm glad everyone kept their heads and made it through
---
Yes, shocking that a 10+ year old MMO is in a decline. They may be able to turn it around but picking on 0.0 ratters is not going to suddenly bring in new players.
---
It would have led to that even without rorquals and injectors, it would just have taken 2 or 3 more years. Remember that Eve is 17, and in 2015 both goons and NCPL already got more than 300 titans each.
---
The "REEEE" on reddit has nothing to do with CCP rollbacking anything, lost subs are. Stainguy mentioned (oh dear i'm actually quoting him) that as per CCP's own data 3 months subs where the most populars; it seems coherent that they rollback it after 2 months before most of these subs fade away and people leave for good.
---
who's this fucking plant pot. sounds like a massive wanker
---
But thats all info they need.
---
Woooo boy your Grr Goons is loud as fuck
---
It always was easy to make capitals, the only difference is that you needed a POS before and it was way more costly (lol Sotiyos).
---
 Rorquals and injectors only sped the process. Supercapital proliferation was always going to be a thing one day or another, Eve is 17.
---
Because when 1/3rd of your playerbase chooses to adapt by unsubbing, suddenly the game stops being profitable.
---
I’m here to win not lose, so I’m gonna fly the best doctrine I can, not the sub optimal one, and so is the rest of the game. 
---
Putting the ‘balance on the players’ if they want a good fight is retarded from a game design and gameplay pov as players just are not gonna willing put themselves at a disadvantage.
---
Test still runs two BS comps, Nightmares and Megathrons, both are more fun than Muninns... Both struggle big find against Muninn fleets... Unfortunately, we're stuck with Muninns until CCP decide to make them shit...
---
I actually had the same kind of idea, except instead of a T2 attack battlecruiser it was a T2 battleship called the [arsenal ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_ship).
---
My initial idea was to use the Abbadon, Rokh, Hyperion, and Maelstrom as the hulls for them since they're the biggest, bulkiest battleships for each faction and thus most suited for the role. They would get bonuses useful against capital/supercapital ships and structures while being effectively unable to target anything smaller than a battleship: their entire reason for existing is to even the battlefield somewhat against capital ships and structures.
---
As a new player, I have absolutely *no clue* how viable this is, but I figure I should put it out where everyone can see it so I get feedback on it. If you think it's a good idea, awesome, I'll have actually contributed something useful! If you think it's terrible, that's fine too, just please take the time to detail *why* this is the case so I can improve my theorycrafting for future ideas.
---
He's also a mouthpiece that is not above lying to try to tell people what they want to hear.  I don't understand the hardon for him around here when he's proven to flat out lie to the community's face if he thinks its what we want to hear.  He's not even very good at it, usually there's internet proof going against what he says.
---
Whether it's him or his overlords forcing him to act this way, it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.  The end result is the same, and he's the face speaking the words, so he takes the brunt of it.
---
He could be the nicest guy in the world personally, but that is irrelevant.  As a community manager, I don't feel he's done a good job at that.  At all.
---
I would add that unlimited multi-boxing has also exacerbated the situation. I think it's ridiculous that 1 person can be running a 10-20 toon multi-boxed fleet and either rat or rorq mine. This also doesn't help the inflation we are seeing in the market.
---
I understand that multi-boxing is necessary to operate efficiently, especially with caps. But does anyone else think they should put a limit on the amount of toons you can multi? This would also have the benefit of disrupting bot farms.
---
Unfortunately, with injectors and multi-boxing, I don't think we will see a change as they make CCP way too much money.
---
&gt; It happens mostly in exploration based activities like escalations and DEDs and some forms of low-med WH farming and, yes, anom farming. Also null/low missions. It happens in FW as well, for obvious reasons, like you stated correctly.
---
Escalations usually require special fits to do, as the overseer turret fires very damaging torpedos that have to spec tanked with deadspace hardeners. Omni tanked ships will get blapped trying to do escalations, which means they are not capable of PvPing against a prepared opponent. 
---
&gt; who said rats shooting at you must equal them draining your tank?
---
Rats actually hurt quite a bit to non-spec tanked ships. For example, the 8 rats that spawn in a forsaken hub have about 700 DPS combined, which need a couple mods in order to have a cap stable tank against, slots that are effectively useless in PvP.
---
Thank you for a well thought out reply.
---
This I can understand. This is an issue in whs also but we can close our ents and send them home. In NS you can kill them but never truly send them home they know where you live.
---
But it is essentially cloaky camping is the core of the issue as it's the most griefing playstyle short of hs ganking haulers and miners.
---
Again thank you for the conversation.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78965310/ :(
---
what i really want is a link to that video you guys have about the "BRING MORE ABADDONS" the video was name campfire or some shit. but i cant fuckign find it
---
A benchmark of poor game design.
---
I currently have no reason to expand. No reason to expand causes no reason to fight. Going back to regional ore distribution causes fights.
---
and that was even with multiple plex sales and skillpoint login rewards to mask the damage, imagine how bad it really was when you cut those out.
---
I actually don't like talking to people in local because Eve players are more retarded than FPS fanbois. At least they *know* they'd better serve as spare parts. Eve players are dumb as fuck but Google terms before they talk to feel smarter.
---
...is that an ancient Egyptian *flintlock?*
---
...goddamnit I want one. *Frakking Yu-Gi-Oh*.
---
the goal of blackout wasn't to discourage ratting, likewise, my goal isn't either
---
Engage your brain.
---
Skill required to rat in a super versus skill/experience required to run level 5 abyssals maybe? (Ive never ran them)
---
I'll forward this comment and see what I can find for you &lt;3
---
How can you be interested in the health of the game when you clearly don't understand basic fundamental concepts of how people play?
---
When I started playing Eve it would go like this:
---
* Undock from the station, not a citadel, and hope that the undock isn't camped;
---
* Warp to a POS off-grid (which might be bubbled and camped) or start burning down the pipe (which might have a gate camp) to get to the ratting pocket;
---
* The ratting system may or may not have a station in it, so while ratting there was a decent chance I'd have nowhere to escape if hunters came into system;
---
* If I did have a station, I'd have to hope I was able to warp and dock before they caught me, because if they got scram I'd be dead;
---
* Unless I was in a super or a titan, nothing that I krabbed in was big enough to ping a response fleet to save me when I'm caught;
---
Today it goes more like this:
---
* Undock from the citadel safely tethered;
---
* Warp to the jump gate on grid, in range of that same citadel;
---
* Jump into my krabbing pocket, or maybe hop a system or two to get to the jump gate to the krabbing pocket;
---
* If Near2 pings that an enemy has been spotted nearby I just warp to the nearest citadel and tether;
---
* If I'm slow to warp I can always jump to a cyno beacon in range of my keepstar, or just light a cyno for FAXes to jump through and save me, because I'm most likely in a capital ship (rorq/carrier/super) anyway;
---
you are a scholar
---
It brought me back
---
You're back! Hooray!
---
i stole confessor from  idiot mining in lonetrek.  tldr 1 account 2 ships 1 loss.
---
[This aint gonna work on me](https://storage.googleapis.com/ygoprodeck.com/pics/42309337.jpg)
---
If you join caldari, you wont have organized groups to fight along side. If you join Gallente, and get into a decent corp you gain access to alot of side content as well they get invited to by their allies. Up to you though.
---
Alright maybe you can detail how it doesn't do that.
---
I mean it's worth it. but only if you'll actually use it
---
At this point me and my corp have moved to wormhole space and effectively given up on k space.
---
Atleast in W space local isnt a thing and you can in theory do roams with a small gang up a chain and look for people to blap in a c5/6, maybe youll get an escalation and get some nice kills.
---
So let's say I'm in the Vale and I have my regional ore. And say Fountain has different ore. Do I need to conquer Fountain now and hold both regions? Is the implication that I need to hold space in all areas? 
---
I'm not trying to be a dick I'm just honestly wondering how I get all their ore types but also keep my ore? I would assume trading but that's the opposite of fighting.
---
This is actually really well edited.
---
Have an updoot.
---
Mouth Trumpet
---
u got baited
---
From what I gather the initial skill learning phase is already over for abyssals. Tons of guides plus you can run them on SISI. But you dont need to do abyssals, Plenty of other activities for good isk.
---
I wonder if it would be possible to make piracy missions where you get told to raid a faction's supplies and steal their shit. It might be a nice way for pirates to make ISK and earn materials, presuming it was implemented correctly...
---
&gt;but they don't usually back down when others show up either  
---
Makes you wonder how they aquired the nickname "Warp Away" :thinking:
---
Balance that by the number of newbros who've quit because of these jackasses.
---
Well, the hate behind wardec groups like PIRAT certainly does owe in part to suppression of corp growth and seal clubbing in highsec. There's a reason why new players are often told to go to null, where it is safer and fairer.
---
Most of it however is the fact that their playstyle is the opposite of what most consider good gameplay.
---
* In fair fights they are pretty unskilled but rely on sec mechanic abuse (e.g. neutral logi patch was *for them*) and bling tanks to win or stalemate. The fact that they consider themselves to be some kind of elite generates disdain, but the difficulty of punishing them for it generates frustration and loathing.
---
* They're highly risk averse, and while that isn't unique, they are definitely some of the most egregious offenders. PIRAT and other groups have been known to purge people for losses.
---
* It's also fairly widely believed that a chunk of their income came from super botting in rus space and RMT. People hate them for that.
---
Also a reason in common with suicide gankers. Another part of it is that they operate in highsec. In a game where anxiety and paranoia are a way of life, having some space where you can exist safely is important to people, especially casuals who don't necessarily understand the details of HS mechanic fights.
---
basically the difference between you mining and a person mining in large nullsec alliances is that when you get jumped, you either escape or die, wheras when the miners in nullsec get jumped , the fleet commander in a roqual activates the panic module which makes them invulnerable for 7 minutes and then (before cyno changes) , lights a cyno where the alliances standing response fleet drops jumps 15 carriers to the cyno and kills any remaining attackers
---
i never said it didn't do that
---
i have no idea what point you're trying to make, just say it lmao
---
Simple example : every friendly duplicate citadel of the same type raise the damage cap by 25% for every duplicate in the system, and also reduce their resistances. Debuff lasting one day from DT so you could theorically smash all their citadels easily when they spam it. "Friendly" need to be tuned so blue donut don't spam citadels in their allies space (or with neutral corps), like using ACL's to count who is allowed to dock and who isn't (based on a X day history to prevent griefing by removing allies from ACL before DT, or any better idea to prevent it, really).
---
Remove one timer for every non-XL citadel in K-space (I'll let WH people decide what to do with theirs), and make timers for these citadels work like POSes did (24h +/- 4h I think) to prevent TZ tanking. XL structures final timer is difficult to sort, because these are heavy assets but they WILL be spammed if not kept in check, I'll let people have better ideas than me.
---
Also, unfueled citadels (with no module active) have no tether, and damage cap + timer are removed after a few hours without any module running.
---
I'm in Wangs and I didnt even know this was going on lol. Mustve been someones side project cuz we definetly didnt send fully fledged fleets out to you, I'd have known. When you say all of lowsec, who does that mean exactly? I feel kinda bad for you honestly, we always want more PVPers out here.
---
I agree with this 100%
---
A bit of both really. Look back upon how things happened historically. Wars were fought over control of moon goo. Now, that is unnecessary for the most part.
---
hurrayyyyyy
---
What the fuck did I just read.
---
That's just not going to happen and would kill off the player-base faster than any idea posed thus far.  Maybe if that was the way it had been done from the beginning that would be good but we're too far gone now for that to happen.
---
Why does anybody have invalid SSL certs in the era of Let's Encrypt? F.
---
Not very safe if it's public, eh?
---
Yep.
---
In a world where money is infinite, ships can be bought in infinite supply and produced in infinite supply for as long as you have manpower. 
---
If you have infinite wealth and ships the only resources that actually matter are player numbers,so you can +1 everyone, player morale, leadership quality, intell quality and higher ranked spies and the actual space you own so it can act as a buffer.
---
There is no incentive for anyone to fight anyone, holding more space is useless since you cant effectively hold all that space and the corp has infinite pockets anyway. 
---
We wont see another major war till someone really pisses someone else off or someone really fucks up
---
You have 'bae' in your name.
---
My pleasure.
---
Yes, I mean plenty of people had issues with cloaky camping before this. The core of the arguments imo are the griefing aspect. Like they even write in their bios that they will leave you alone if you pay them, they fully understand that the point is to bother people enough to achieve a gain. And CCP has a love for this kind of "emergent gameplay" but everyone who isnt the minority that does these things absolutely hate them. You can find the same attitude in every game and also irl, people hate griefers.
---
Mainly because you lack counters. You cant solo fight groups that live to wardec newbie corps and farm then in HS. You cant decloak a cloaky camper. And you cant d-scan a cloaked ship which might have a cyno gen that will bring in full fleets on top of your head. Lack of counters always kills balance and peoples will to engage in an activity. Imo.
---
&gt; This is not a PvP game. This is a PvE game. You can remove PvP from the game but you cannot remove PvE.
---
You can't remove PVP because then what is the point of your PVE? What fun is there in Eve's PVE? The only thing that gives it an edge of excitement is the chance of being jumped, or the feeling that it's making money to use later in PVP - but where are you going to PVP if the other side is able to hide all its content too?
---
&gt; I dont get what the alternative is? You play the game correctly and you still get punished?
---
It's not being 'punished' to be engaged in PVP, and in fact it's essential for organic generation of gameplay that PVEers *can* be engaged, and are able to hold out or fight back for backup. If a PVEer can completely avoid PVP then of course every PVEer will avoid PVP, and there is no PVP apart from lame arranged fights.
---
&gt; alot of suggestions have been given in the past months
---
A lot of nullblobbers have suddenly found all sorts of reasons to suggest a return to local. For the 2 years before that you've been shouting down all of those suggestions, like delayed local, or regional chat instead of system chat, or cloaks allowing you to evade local.
---
&gt; And why the cyno change is also shit and will most likely also be reverted or heavily iterated on.
---
The cyno change is another one where CCP have correctly decided to address a big problem with gameplay, and nullblobbers have got so used to the incredible convenience of cynos that they're trying to get it reversed. Just think for a moment of how OP a cyno is. If I want to burn a battleship 10 jumps I have to spend 20 minutes gating it, risking 10 gatecamps on the way. But if you want to move a capital you can do it instantly and, even after the tether delay, in near perfect safety (particularly with local coming back).
---
And once again people have proposed lots of other suggestions in this area, to do with making cyno inhibitors actually inhibit cynos for the most part, which nullsecers are quite happy to shout down.
---
FC made dumb calls considering he could've been getting in close since armor hacs focus on being low sig  and hard to hit by the maels.
---
It’s retarded that people think game balance should be based around noob ships.
---
a t3 cruiser does more dps than a frigate
---
Cry about that
---
You just hate carriers because it has the word “capital” and don’t want to use anything that counters the fuck out of it
---
Exactly! 😀
---
That's how i feel about you. My point is clear, that there needs to be a balance between creation and destruction to have a healthy game.
---
I just got settled back in empire and now they remove blackout!
---
Yeah i was the same, with blackout it was basically go do some abyssals, but at that point living in null is a liability instead of an asset.
---
Its all sort of haters out there, the one that posted this was probably kicked out for being a spy or even worse an azz. This obviously a salty post lol
---
It is but you have to consider that a lot of fights happening nowadays would never happen if you couldn’t use non committing doctrines like munins or mjd fleets. Munins online is the consequence of citadel one week in advance timers, fatigue nerf and jump gates that make blobing so easy. You just can’t use battleships in these conditions unless it’s jumpy ones that only really work on defence unless you’re turbo blobing. In hostile conditions if you don’t win with a battleship fleet you just feed the whole fleet, if you don’t win with a hac fleet you just lose your recons, a few dps and disengage.
---
I mean is nulls pve really that lucrative if you look at it on a personal level?
---
If I run a super, which is a huge investment, I get ~350m/hr.
---
That means it takes me two hours just to buy one mainline doctrine ship.
---
It'd take like 50 hours just to break even on the super.
---
I dunno what level you think is good, but even just at those numbers I'm thinking it's just about where it should be.
---
How many hours should I have to do high end pve to afford a ship?
---
&gt;My point is clear, that there needs to be a balance between creation and destruction to have a healthy game.
---
i've never debated this to start with, so why do you keep replying?
---
my point is- you cannot have a healthy balanced nullsec ecosystem with local chat giving you instant perfect intelligence- it's impossible to make it worth a damn for anyone other than bots or mass multiboxers because with a single account you could make double that in highsec with a 3 month old character.
---
₽₽₽  
---
For the Motherland!
---
What if I told you ratters make isk to buy ships to use in pvp... mind blown
---
I remember OTEC. I distinctly remember having tech moons in our space owns by hostiles that we just kind of had to let go because there was a super cartel of crap. PL didn't own space at all because they got all their isk from the moons they defended (and I'm sure other means). And surprise it still had huge coalitions.
---
And almost 8k left, so you know....
---
But new players won't know or care about 0.0 right away. Something else will being them in.
---
https://youtu.be/KThlYHfIVa8
---
Wierd al said it best
---
People want targets, not opponents
---
yikes
---
Tell a bunch of people that because they are convinced ratters rat just to rat and never do anything else (which I'm sure some do)
---
Yeah, nothing extra goes with blackout
---
You literally get an immediate rush upon decent PvP. I tackled a hecate with my ikitursa and got the heart pounding and shakes despite being able to tank it with a single rep. When his friends came it got even worse- faster heartbeat and more shakes. After I killed a few of em and was able to disengage after my corpmates got crushed I took some time to calm down. 
---
There is reward to PvP, you just don't get it in a blob. Theres no uncertainty or sense of risk. Yeah you can lose your ship but you get it replaced easily. You have logi and a cap escalation and are one of several hundred.
---
Ok, so we discussed it this morning. Couple ideas mentioned was a module to 'triangulate' nearest cloaky ships with multiple ships fitted. Another one was a module that maybe 'blinks' the cloak to give a better idea of where the cloaker is. Maybe a 3-5 second duration with triggers every second or second and a half. I feel there should be more to be able to screw with cloaking ships and right now we just don't have that.
---
While sucking goon dick on your way up.
---
&gt;This is absolutely not true of local, no player has to make any kind of effort to have a neutral appear in local.
---
This really is true. Intel channels are actively used by people to stop their allies dying. It requires effort and attention.
---
Would there be a way to do that on the contracts market relatively safely and securely?
---
Tbh theyd pull the plug at 10k
---
Your right that is a dumb idea
---
PIRAT like cocks
---
Eh better rap than that plz XD
---
A correctly fit tackle ship should be able to catch and tackle you pretty much every time, if it hasn't been spotted on the gate entering the system. Then the game becomes who will win the fight, not whether there is a fight. If both sides play perfectly then PVP should happen, because otherwise PVP will never happen, and because hunting involves an awful lot more effort and skill than anomaly ratting near your home.
---
But note that being caught doesn't mean a guaranteed loss, you can bait for PVP, fit appropriately to be able to fight back, or have friends nearby and win the engagement.
---
Lol PvP is the backbone of eve
---
which in your case would only be possible with awoxing or safelogging right?
---
The safety of null is a lot more than just local chat.
---
&gt; the only way to get eve back to a PvP game where people get into fights is to get rid of Supers and Capitals. 
---
No, I don't think so. I think there are some basic fixes that could make a huge difference:
---
* Rorqs need to go back to being boosting ships, not the premier miner.
---
* PANIC modules need to get deleted, but the Rorq will need an increase in tank to a middle point to balance.
---
* FAXes need to get deleted or at least have more work done to them.
---
* Tether needs to be removed from all structures smaller than a Fortizar or Keepstar, at the very least.
---
* Jump Gates shouldn't be able to anchor on grid with a citadel, their range should be reduced, they should cost more fuel, and you shouldn't be able to take one if you're tackled.
---
* High end combat anomalies (havens/sanctums) should be more rare, but DED sites and missions should be more plentiful. This, combined with abyssal sites, should encourage a shift away from ratting supers and towards Rattlesnakes/Widows/etc.
---
* Data sites in low/nullsec should be more valuable to make room for more explorers (there's a bottle neck with relic sites atm).
---
* Citadels should be significantly more expensive to build and deploy, and low-powered structures should only have one timer, with the ultimate goal of reducing citadel spam.
---
* The Blackout should return, but the PVE rewards in systems impacted by it should be buffed to bring the risk/reward ratio more in line. Nullsec should be high risk, high reward.
---
(Sorry for all the bullet point lists, it's just easier for me to organize isolated points/steps.)
---
Nonsense, removing local was only described by a few people, not a majority of people on this sub. Then you had people like /u/CCP_Falcon jump on board with the whole "im a hunter and its epic" mentality, only to see the toxicity of it shoot through the roof. Now, thankfully, they have been shown their shit doesn't work and their idea was killing the game. Sometimes, you need to think a bit more rather than just rationalise an idea because it would be good for your playstyle, and not others.
---
Well why are you entitled to kill someone that doesn't fuck up lol.
---
If a krab is being vigilant and not doing anything wrong, you shouldn't be able to kill them.
---
and Ill be there to bomb your excavs
---
Oh for sure. My issue is when they camp a single spot for ever like.. move do something else for a time but no that's all these characters are built for it's all they do and now they just get extracted to be free.
---
I actually believe the cloaks should take fuel and reload and such giving them a vulnerability some how. I also think there should be an air sonar style thing specifically to find cloaked ships. Again probably takes fuel.
---
If cloaks were addressed and a form of local that's truely delayed and not he who speaks dies. Tie it to gate timer or just give us observatories ffs.
---
But I agree ccp may be a tad to lacking in their griefing rules as perma cloaky camping should be considered. I know a guy from test that got fed up with leadership and  he left a set of toons to camp all there systems and haven't moved them since. And it's been a while.. months and months while. I could argue the playstyle is fine but the permanant nature they have is unacceptable. They can camp with impunity
---
Yeah the dudes with the Kingsguard Video, always a bigger fish. Those vids were dope! I too assumed those guys. Is it not?
---
interesting. Leadership told us it was Did He Say Jump and Pen Is Out or Snuffed out. To be exact the mail said exactly this 
---
There are two bigger Entities trying to get us out and multiple smaller ones. 
---
The Biggest asshats are Did He Say Jump who literally drop their capitals on everything that moves and haver more than a bad image around this region to begin with, and members of PEN IS OUT which will call their alliance as soon as we'd try to make a move (dropping capitals for example) or go right to their parent alliance, Snuffed Out. 
---
We got a lovely blackmail letter from pen is out who want 10b isk to defend the fortizar for us and "any other structures you put up are likely to be killed by myself or others I fly with." Its doubtful they would even care protecting us after they received their money, and even if, this deal would never make us independent and is just ridiculous to begin with. 
---
Bollena sent that mail to them 
---
[https://imgur.com/a/zlnjAuk](https://imgur.com/a/zlnjAuk)
---
At this point they have defended tenal better than ncpl didnt.
---
It'll generate them zero revenue when the game is dead. 
---
Short-sighted greed claims another victim.
---
This right here. 
---
I came back to eve for the last time right after citadels went live and ended up being fucking deployed everywhere like Starbucks trash on the highway. 
---
That and skill injectors were the writing on the wall, ccp will continue to operate the game until it is no longer meeting their profit targets then they will slow development and try to find a buyer.
---
I've been done for a bit but just stop by for the nostalgia and the bants.
---
I think that's right. We need a bunch of solutions tied together:
---
1) New players retained
---
2) PVE that has enough reward to outweigh the risk in null and other spaces
---
3) PVP that is fun in many ways
---
4) Enough targets for the latter
---
Pretending that this is either a PVP or PVE game is misguided I think.
---
In prehistory we used to say: "no u".
---
Weren't they the right size and ccp was going to fix the size of supers when they figured out how to solve bumping?
---
For several of us, the point of ratting is purely making idk to go do other things.
---
can you elaborate on why?
---
I mean, 14 Devoters is kind of a lot at one time.
---
:((((((((
---
I never said anything about gaping.
---
Huh hello? A single void bomb already zeroes the cap of a whole mwd munin fleet and fucks it up quite hard because it loses all range control. Good luck reliably bombing a munin fleet though.
---
No I wasn't kicked out for being a spy. In fact I was invested. I wanted nothing more than to see the Empire successful. I feel like leadership let us down and gave up to easy. I felt like congratulating the people involved in trying to run us out of town. Because they were successful in every way possible. 
---
Now you are correct about it being a salty post. I am salty because I lost cash money. But shame on me for investing and not thinking I would loose it.
---
I think that's kind of the key right there, figuring out a change that brings enough enjoyment to pvpers that they want to come back, but also not being so dramatic that it pushes away more people on the other side. Structure timers are definitely part of that cancer eating this game from the inside.
---
&gt;Everything you think is actually at odds with reality when you look at the **data**
---
shows eve offline graph
---
&gt; if the past is any indication of the future...
---
so is that statistical **data** not data anymore? the bitch is contradicting herself...
---
You could still use intel channels under the blackout and they don't really have anything to do with the changes CCP made.
---
Solid bait @++
---
Sorry to hear that Cuban
---
No, you couldn't. Intel was only possible if you saw the people, rather than seeing them appear in local. Sitting on a gate 24/7 is not a good way of keeping people interested in the game.
---
If a system was in use and didn't have a station it had a POS.
---
Sure the inhabitant had to BM it first but after that a hunter wasn't going to catch you first try.
---
The main different is that the POS was "alliance only" so that people could leave themselves AFK in it. Maybe it's time to add a service module to medium structures to let them run an ACL beyond "Owning Alliance".
---
Weapons timer does prevent tethering.
---
Good point, unfortunately there needs to be more to this game then PvP. A lot of people leave this game because eventually it becomes impossible to resist the bug in your ear explaining how stupid the nullsec based elected reps have convinced the devs to make the game. The PVE is all money based, not story based STILL. The entirety of content changes ultimately just lead to more derp ganking over and over and over. Frankly, I do not understand how some of these hardcore alliances have managed to stay around so long, the game gets SOOOOOOO boring after 6 months to a year and it takes at LEAST a year to forget enough to want to come back again. 
---
I for one HATE multi-boxing and Alts. This crap ruins the game for me. As an employed adult I can easily afford to set up disgusting multibox armies using high end pc equipment but then i think, why would i do that? I can literally just BUY ISK!!! Then as I get close to buy $500 in plex, thinking in my head, this will be great, i will never have to "rat" again... And just before I hit the purchase key, I realize that ratting, missioning, mining, etc, IS the game. The PVP is like an ancillary event you get sometimes and it isnt that fun. If i buy 500 billion isk in Cash, I just wont have a reason to log in anymore and then i realize i need to stop playing immediately. 
---
CCP has had almost 2 decades to change high/lowsec into something fun that doesnt require alts and multiboxing but they didn't. :(
---
Screw you sideways! I just tried to spin it, then tried to click the ok button.
---
For what I know of the actual null sec experience, all of that seems reasonable. Spamming citadels seems like a broken mechanic anyway. No one should have so much isk that they have enough to spam stations into existence during a war.
---
As for tethering, as primarily an indy pilot, having something like tethering for managing PI would be reasonable. It’s a little unbalanced to be the perfect target when with most/all of your screen obscured by the planetary view, but that’s certainly not something that’s contributing to the majority of players’ frustration with eve
---
Well that’s what you get when you put into a game so much aoe firepower and cheap caps that dumpster anything that commits
---
Real wormholers use D-scan. 
---
Please handover your portable wormhole generator and flair.
---
&gt; i've never debated this to start with, so why do you keep replying?
---
You would know if you read my original comment, the one you 'stopped reading' because you saw something that offended your delicate sensibilities.
---
&gt;my point is- you cannot have a healthy balanced nullsec ecosystem with local chat giving you instant perfect intelligence-
---
You can, and in fact we did for years. It was unbalanced by the effects of other changes. People need reasons to fight. And the ability to fight.
---
Not the original poster but yes essentially. World of Warships has damage saturation on its ships. Each part of the ship has a certain amount of HP. Once that "compartments" HP reaches zero anything that hits that does no damage. There is more to it than that but its the short version.
---
In other threads I have supported the idea of names not appearing in local till they uncloak from the gate cloak. Past that,local is either there or not and maybe those living in null space don't deserve "perfect" intel, but they certainly don't deserve zero intel. After all their investment, they certainly didn't deserve an environment where those who would harm them have every advantage.
---
It doesn't take long to recharge the cap to hit your adc.  Like 5 seconds if I remember correctly.
---
Dude... i have no idea
---
You’re missing the point though. The best for the job will always dominate the meta but combat used to be different before hacs rebalance and mjd fleets as you could actually trap and kill the enemy fleet all you do nowadays is dancing around till one party decides to leave.
---
Dudreda is not even in our neck of the woods lol. http://evemaps.dotlan.net/jump/Thanatos,544/Rakapas:Dudreda
---
thats cause youre in goons lel. there are no elite pvpers in there
---
Yes you won’t fuck up more than one adc but the fleet is still sitting duck. A munin fleet that doesn’t move isn’t a strong fleet anymore.
---
You clearly never PvPed in null pre-blackout. Link your killboard
---
do you have a discord I can join
---
It's not just Fozzie, it's the entire dev team. In the entire history of EVE, CCP has never once announced a major change and then not released it. Sure, they have sometimes made changes to it before release but the core mechanics of the change has never significantly been reworked.
---
Tried to gank a dst at the the insta undock shennigans happens
---
Nope not Cuban but that's crazy how you would just accuse some random member. Starting to wonder who are?
---
I've been very direct on my views with regards to the blackout, but feel free to keep trying to spin it to fit your buttblasted narrative :rollyeyes:
---
I dont think the bergmann discord is public anymore.
---
Yeah right
---
PvP is the heart of eve.
---
You fail to realize that the prices of items you trade in DO affect you, since the volume of trade on those items won't magically increase as prices go down. People won't buy twice as many launchers when they're half as expensive, because they can only ever use so many at one time. With how the game is being handled right now, making any kind of economic predictions is pretty much pointless, but I guarantee you - if you think you won't be affected, you're delusional.
---
got a teamspeak then? Something Private
---
You need to think like a bloc when proposing changes.  'Cause they are the ones who will be abusing the hell out of your plans.
---
&gt;What eve needs are incentives for groups to start fighting, expanding, and moving. 
---
Expansion is a bad idea.  It would just result in Goons, Legacy and PanFam owning the map.
---
You need density so that there is space for more groups in null.  The more groups in null, the more friction.  You want Goons to fit in a region.  You want TEST to fit in 2-3 constellations.  You want NC to fit in one system with a Keepstar (Had to get the required "don't undock" joke in somewhere)
---
That leaves a hell of a lot of space for other groups to occupy.  More groups, more friction, more wars.  (And rental empires need to die.)
---
So, crank it up.  Get even more people packed in there so that somebody else can live in places like Vale (had a lovely land-rush when PanFam moved, now starting to get a little friction between the people moving in)
---
"Better" space would give people a reason to fight, but only if it was possible to dislodge someone from that space.  And with the current implementation of the game, that's not gonna happen.  It's not like Frat has actually done well on the battlefield against TEST.  The timer mechanics in the game are just that bad right now.
---
But "Better" is also an extremely delicate balancing act.  You make it too much better and the owners become unstoppable.  You make it not better enough and nobody cares enough about it.  Do you trust CCP to handle that delicate balance when they literally have screwed it up every time they've tried?
---
&gt; Make it so that over-mining causes resources to deplete and you must take other space in order to attain more. 
---
This results in the blocs taking space and leaving it fallow until they "rotate their crops" to it.  Empty space not being used is not good for the game.
---
Again, a bloc's reaction to this is different than your individual reaction.  They've got wealth and lots of players.  "Go take three regions and make sure nobody mines in them until we want to" is actually practical.
---
Also:
---
&gt; Wars and big battles aren't just good for eve for the headlines they generate, they're good because fighting means isk sinks, BIG ones. 
---
Dead ships are an ISK faucet, not a sink.  Insurance adds money to the game.  Any money you spend replacing your ship is given to another player, instead of being removed from the game.
---
So, wars don't actually help inflation.  Remove insurance and they become a small ISK sink due to sales taxes and broker fees.
---
Im just going to say this, if you can post other people game name, why dont you be a man and post your name. If you are a man, but im thinking you might be a a girl or a boy
---
Bombers can't bomb excavs that aren't there
---
1) Keep current, I've been playing again since christmas though my time to play is now suspect as I'm not interested in PVE in EVE its boring as fuck, 2) Fuck you too.
---
Look, I respect what you do, its a hard job to try and please people, however, that isn't what you did here. You helped escalate the toxic bullshit that was happening and that, I am fairly confident, is not part of your job and something that I have lost respect for you over. After seeing the drop in players, the absolute decimation of the player-empires in game, its quite apparent blackout was a bad idea. So how about CCP finally engage with the player base and make some good, worth while decisions, rather than maintain your bunker mentality and the arrogance that you know best, because clearly, you don't.

---
Because ganking miners and ratters is the easiest way to get the high killboard efficiency that the "elite pvp" kids feel entitled to.
---
Their playstyle is dependent on having miners and ratters to prey on - if they fought each other instead of ganking pve'ers, they couldn't *all* have high killboard efficiency. In the absence of easy, low-risk killmails, their playstyle becomes unsustainable, so they "have" to do whatever they can to find ratters and miners to gank. If the free killmails ever dry up, like they started to do during the blackout, these "elite pvpers" have nothing to do and lose interest in the game.
---
What's the word for an organism that is dependent on a host for survival, while simultaneously being harmful to that host?
---
&gt;However, there are multiple regions that have every single moon goo
---
Nope.  On the high end, there is goo only available in the North, and goo only available in the South.
---
You would rather not fight just because you might lose some isk?
---
I didnt say put balance on the players. This post is complaing about how stale the meta is and I’m saying for fun he should mix it up.
---
Thankyou - much appreciated.
---
Yes, but there was things to fight over.  Something we generally lack now.  I'm a GSF diplo, I DON'T WANT PEACE OR A BLUE DONUT!!  I want to fight people.  I think that giving us things to fight over besides Reddit epeen would do the game a world of good.
---
Toot toot clop clop
---
Thanks - excellent write up and much appreciated.
---
Glad to hear bad ideas from reddit will never be used by CCP again
---
Incursions exist already, people anom rat because it's what they like to do in this game, removing what people like to do is exactly how you get back to 11k people online.
---
Eve has a aging population, some people dont have time to spend on doing incursions. 
---
Besides most of the isk people make via anom ratting goes to buying pvp ships that end up getting destroyed so the isk sink and faucet is balanced in that way. What is not balanced is the reason for going to war. When it takes 3 weeks to destroy a 500mill structure people stop going to war unless it's a absolute necessity, then the faucet and sink becomes unbalanced.
---
Imagine not having the ability at all to form at a coherent argument. Thats what you call braindead lol.
---
Not possible with the way CCP decided to break up rigs and refineries for the production side of the game.
---
(I'm presuming you'd have similar limits on ECs and Refineries, since those work &gt;95% of the time as well as a citadel)
---
Change that, and then you could add in severe limits.
---
crazy to accuse a random member but totally fine to crai to reddit w/all ur corp emails? Lotta salt here.

I don't think so as long as the battleship PvE that replaces Super/Carrier ratting pays close to it. Incursions right now pay around 100-120 in highsec when optimally run. Add a 50-100% nullsec modifier and I don't see why people wouldn't stick around for it.
---
Let’s get this party going, 11.
---
AAR?
---
Can confirm. Have been in a few of their wars with E-Uni.
---
Absolute shit MP.
---
OP, both Caldari and Gallente Militias have their fair share of farmers, to argue that one militia has more than the other is a ridiculous suggestion as majority of them switch sides for profit.
---
If you want to join Caldari, look into groups like Red Vs Blue and PANN on the Caldari side of the warzone. They are very organised and have been in the warzone for a good while now.
---
Correction, it will no longer provide bonus damage due to critical systems in that area are destroyed and will only do base damage or overpenetration.  You never not take damage, but you won't be repeatedly crit if they keep hammering an exposed bow.
---
I think a better idea would be to make low-sec have a little more value to miners, manufacturers, hackers, and traders. For example, I would say 90% of the belts are emptied with ore from the NPC's that mine them. Another example is the moon mining system (which is cool) is not really worth the effort due to the low quality moons in low-sec versus the risk. We just need more opportunities to make low-sec the next level before null.
---
wait! Did HIC point block subcaps to dock in hisec?
---
Do they really count as a PVP group?
---
Krabs can shoot back. Not effectively, but they can. Newbro Iterons and Bestowers near trade hubs can't.
---
Oh please, Squids are notorious for farming. And there is no clear Caldari leadership anymore, hasnt been since Templis left for greener pastures.
---
&gt;Always wondered, maybe a terrible idea, but what if regions/constellations/systems mineral resources and pirate populations could become depleted if the area's PvE content was over farmed
---
Then the blocs would take large chunks of space and "rotate their crops".  One area would be the part getting farmed, the others would be left fallow until they were ready to be farmed again.  The blocs would ensure that nobody else got to use the fallow space, since that would interfere with the rotation.
---
Production infrastructure is extremely hard to move - each T2 rig for a Sotiyo cost more than the Sotiyo.  So the blocs can't just wander the map.
---
tl;dr
---
That sounds a lot easier to do, honestly. I think the belts and anomalies in hisec should have a greater NPC miner presence, with lowsec having a lesser presence reflecting how it’s less safe. Maybe have NPC miners turn up at moon chunks that get popped in hisec, too?
---
You really need a real hobby instead of following me around like a lost puppy.
---
I'd rather have a lost puppy, at least they are cute.
---
&gt; **stay** undocked 
---
They undock when they have insurmountable numerical and firepower superiority and when it looks like they won't have that they immediately re-dock. It just so happens that they get a lot of situations where they can catch isolated wardec targets and instakill them, because they're permanently at war with basically everyone and there's a fool born every minute. As a result they continuously attain very high kill totals and efficiency ratings, while causing maximum annoyance for everyone else because it's very difficult to bait them out into actually fighting and losing ships. (And it's also why, when they do lose ships their losses are rather expensive, and it's very satisfying to see them get #rekt as penance for their activities.)
---
That's the problem though. Try and fail is literally all that CCP has spend the last 3-4 years doing with their latest dumb ideas instead of listening to the good player ideas. It gets really tiresome to see them change after change making the game more and more of a dumpster fire without any of it actually being good for the game.
---
Do you think the trajectory of the last 8 weeks is healthy? The game actually needs players.
---
The farmers are on the Caldari side because they currently have the higher Tier, they will switch back over the Gallente sooner or later.
---
As the dude that was having the conversation, when I say we weren't, we weren't. It wasn't an opinion, it was a fact.
---
He is unironically right though.
---
Get an expedition frigate, warp to a safe, cloak up and do your PI.
---
We wouldn't move. We would expand and implement rules to avoid oversaturation.
---
If you think smaller alliances have a hard time now, this is nothing compared to what would happen if resources depleted.
---
You're basically arguing for a system that puts an absolute limit to how many players the game can support. Systems are finite.
---
you have one thing galmil has never had though, "The Russian Horde"
---
&gt; Site farming over downtime was so common everyone fucking new it.
---
As you said, it's certainly not a new mechanic. I started in 07 and often used to scan down mission runners who left the completion trigger on a high bounty mission, in order to farm it after downtime day after day.
---
That would work, but I’m insane and would have to train 9 toons... it’s not a bad idea and I will remember should the day come that tethering isn’t an option.
---
Reroll the server
---
Nice strawman. Thanks for the great discussion.
---
What's above is your opinion on the data points that you have that are publicly available, as is your obsession with toxicity.
---
It's incorrect in my opinion, and that's where we stand.
---
Get over it mate, the sooner you move on, the better you'll feel.
---
I dont disagree, I wouldnt play this game if it lacked PvP. But others would. However if you remove PvE the game collapses that very instant. This games foundation lies upon PvE, specifically industry.
---
PvP has never as long as Ive played this game been organic in any fashion. You engage a PvE ship which is ill equipped to PvP with superiour numbers and you somehow feel this is fair? If fairness had anything to do with the new NS roaming meta wouldnt be all cloaky ships right? People wouldnt be bombing excavators right? This is the BS part of your argument. Very few I have come across actually want a fight, they just wanna kill your shit and then leave. Its nothing organic about it as you are suggesting. Its kill or be killed. And guess what, people dont wanna anyone else content in game they pay to play. 
---
Because local has never been the issue. Most have been trying to tackle the major issues. But CCP just made local into a major issue so they dont need to deal with the real problems.
---
None of that has changed. The only thing that has changed is that its a shitton more cumbersome to move them. Its simply unfun. And not to mention that it renders capitals kinda useless and if you make an entire shipclass useless then people who liked flying them wont take kindly to it. Its the same issue as with the blackout, you are alienating players.
---
Yet again, cynos are not a big issue for the majority. CCP has yet again made it into a major issue so they dont have to deal with the real problems. 
---
If a large enough portion belives these issues to be the problems then fine, we can adress them. But how about we begin by changing the biggest issues that impact the most people first? And just work down the list and see how things evolve. Because I can promise you that when you start that way a lot of other things wont be issues after a while. 
---
Both local and cynos have been around forever, they were never issues. Its the other things that came after that created the problems. Lets fix them first and see what happens. This is my stance and I think many others agree with it. Begin in the right end.
---
That's kind of the point of ratting in a deep pocket. It's not as safe as rolling all your holes to krab in a wh, but the idea behind it is the same. That's why people go through all the bullshit of entosising entire regions and clearing out hundreds of citadels to have their own space.
---
you just need to be the second biggest coalition in the game to do that
---
Liquid ozone actually plz
---
Imagine writing a post bad enough that people dont even wanna take the time to correct.
---
It isn't possible.
---
Baited then with a tanked hauler on insta undock
---
I have several hobbies actually, it just so happens that haunting you on reddit is one of them.
---
Also I'm a man, men aren't cute dave, we're ruggedly sexy.
---
Yeah cause Pandemic Legion often drops on people in Highsec mining with 200 T3 Cruisers and kills 10 Rorquals and a couple of Super Carriers.... damn man... youre right... Highsec is WAY more dangerous than Nullsec...  (You're a highsec miner aren't you?)
---
He says, having sat comfortably under the protection of Snuffed Out's capital umbrella for the past 4 years.
---
Ah yes, I'm familiar with *Warships* damage mechanics. It would be interesting to see that sort of thing in EVE, but... yeah, that would require overhauling all of the current logic which treats ships as featureless spheroids. However it would also open the door for something like a subsystem/component damage system where you could debilitate or disable ships by targeting individual modules or functional regions.
---
I feel perfectly fine. There really is nothing to get over. Working in a medical profession I am quite capable of having a heated discussion based on my rationale without getting offended, upset or angry. 
---
My points still stand, and they have value. Sadly, as a community manager it seems you feel the need to try and belittle one of your community, something which only exemplifies my original point. Calling me butt blasted, saying I am obsessed. My friend, this is called passion for a game I have invested  years into. If you are unable to see that and instead retort without professionalism, then maybe you should question your ability to successfully represent what is best for the game on this sub?
---
It doesn't matter how much a bot makes, as long as it makes more than the cost of 500 plex. If they want more isk they just find whatever pays more than the cost of plex and then add more bots or run the bots a few more hours to make up the difference.
---
Was she actually FEMsplaining this to me now??? :-))))))
---
Nah, the death blow was when all of the talent left CCP.  CCP did the most damage to the game themselves well before being acquired by Pearl Assbyss; a lot of the worst shit came about from them trying to inflate numbers while fishing for a buyout.  That's about the time they started TOTALLY ignoring all player feedback instead of just most of it.
---
Fucking hell, this is so much like 90s They Might Be Giants it hurts.
---
Credits are to Jinnan Wu
---
What ever makes you happy, grath.
---
Have a good evening.
---
As a new player, I havee no fuckin idea what's going on so i'll just be lurkin with smiles until then.
---
Adapt or die
---
Great time to go into Delve with a Hound for me
---
&gt;I have three active subs, and for the most part I've just been high-sec mining and fooling around a bit with PvE and PvE.
---
Be serious when you answer this. Do you pay for those subs with your own cash or in game currency?
---
&gt; Eve has a aging population, some people dont have time to spend on doing incursions.
---
Sure, I agree, when it comes to large incursion fleets (HQs). You can still run a single room 5-man (Scout) in 10 minutes now, less if you remove gates. That's around the same time to clear a T1-3 Abyssal or a low-level anomaly.
---
&gt;pvp ships that end up getting destroyed so the isk sink and faucet is balanced in that way.
---
Ships being destroyed is an ISK faucet as it introduces previously non-existant ISK into the game via insurance. 
---
&gt;What is not balanced is the reason for going to war. When it takes 3 weeks to destroy a 500mill structure people stop going to war unless it's a absolute necessity, then the faucet and sink becomes unbalanced.
---
Yeah the structure grind sucks but that has nothing to do with PvE or the subject at hand.
---
Easy to take space when someone else ties up the defender
---
LOL, we knew it was broken the whole time anyway, throughout much of the blackout 1dq1 had a broken local allowing you to talk with people all over EVE and there were also several days where local was showing but not working properly during blackout all over nullsec. Broken chat never left it just wasn't as visible.
---
"Closing the gate after the horse has bolted" is the phrase that comes to mind. CCP implementing citadels is as easy as opening a gate when you compare it to the task of removing them again. Not because of code, but because of human nature's resistance to change - especially when something is being taken away.
---
To put it in context, i stopped played and unsubbed from the subredit ~2 years ago because of the direction CCP was going in (citadels, HAW caps, carriers, injectors, bugs), which led to the feeling of even getting a titan kill being a mundane achievement. 
---
With blackout I resubbed to the subreddit, to monitor the progress of blackout, but I'm not going to resub to the game until I feel a capital kill is a real achievement, and not just bought with throwaway ISK.
---
That last part is the hard part for CCP to get back, and will take years of blackout-like change to deplete the abundance of minerals and ships everyone has built up. And all the while, new players will not have the benefit of the massive wealth that old players have, making them less likely to stay subbed.
---
Honestly, CCP's only solution might be to just somewhat nerf only the biggest issues (rorqs, HAW caps), and then implement a huge amount of power creep in the form of more powerful ship classes. Then titans can be like the battleships of 10 years ago, and super-titans/T2 carriers/whatever can still be rare. Maybe make super-duper caps uninjectable or something too. Now we have a few problems fixed, but without 'taking things away' from the players.
---
...Well, that was long winded. Oops.
---
Most def most def. Things that prohibit others from doing certain things "just because" are always bad. My biggest hope for Eve is that they do something about HS griefing cause Im certain we have lost more players than we currently have in the game simply because of CCPs love for the "dangerous" playstyle. 
---
I mean, in the end were all nerds playing a RP-based space simulator and spend unhealthy amounts of time on a forum to argue over said simulator. Nobody here is "dangerous" and most are old and have a different mindset all together. The game needs to evolve and adapt to the times.
---
Who said ratters don't want to fight people coming in their system ? If some neutral come to the system while i'm ratting i'll switch to pvp ship and give them a welcome, but those "hunter" only looking for easy target not a fight, and better an afk immobilized target and doesn't shot back. All the time they see me undock pvp ships, they ran. Those "hunter" only pick a fight when they have more number than local guys and they have better combined, in that case why would i pick a fight that i definitely lose ?
---
Because destruction is the beating heart of Eve.
---
NO, U!
---
It's not true chaos until everybody is mad.
---
I mean he can't get around hi sec, coming from null? come on, wake up that lone cell in the smooth peanut.
---
&gt;In fair fights they are pretty unskilled but rely on sec mechanic abuse (e.g. neutral logi patch was *for them*) and bling tanks to win or stalemate.
---
Apparently they aren't even that good at bling tanking. When they tried to structure bash E-Uni a few months ago and got told to fuck off by a swarm of Griffins and Caracals, people said some stuff about how the Guardians (only ships killed were 3/5 Guardians, none of the Leshaks or T3C's, lost a couple of of Griffins, Caracals, other cheap ships in that fight) looked like they were intended to prioritize bling over actually working well in light of today's occurrence, it might be worth pointing out that one of the Griffins was flown by an alt of someone whose main had moved into Ehefkae.
---
Exactly my point lol. They were able to hide it with the blackout for 99% of the time.
---
What can we use DED LP for?  Fuzzworks is coming up empty for any LP store info.
---
if you have only one warpout point in a system you can bubble it to stop people from docking. Gets complicated when there's 15 athanors to choose from, and thats before talking about pds and other cancer
---
Only pay, don't train, only pay!
---
Great idea! Make PVE that requires people to work together for a decent result, that is interactive enough that it cannot be effectively multiboxed. Add in rats that warp off if they aren’t pointed/scrammed so that viable PvP fits are required to run the sites.
---
You're not wrong. Aside from abyssal sites and wh's, pve in this game is actually atrocious.
---
As well as his small dick, damn it.
---
DnG is, indeed, recruiting.
---
As a new player, you should not set foot anywhere near r/Eve. Hang out with people who like the game instead.
---
I think it’s too late. Can’t undo all the damage from Rorquals, citadels, and skill injectors. There is no recovering.
---
You do see that big ass onion logo on the top right?
---
Ccp is a company not a fucking charity.
---
“If they do decide to do further changes please work with them not against them”
---
Wtf is wrong with you lmao.
---
It's okay, dude.  As a veteran player, I feel this video helps sum up the current situation pretty well:  https://youtu.be/Ite6cI7_egg
---
I'm speaking truth. Ask yourself: "Am I getting into this game to have fun or am I trying to get away from something?" Before you know it you're going to be yelling at your kid to not bother you because your buddies "need you." I heard so much shit like that on comms or my fav "Oh shit, my dog shat inside. Why can't he just hold it?" 
---
Some people get protective over their addictions and back-fire effect when someone points it out. I got over mine and I've seen others recover too. So many dudes saying that their so's are side bitches to Eve end up single for life. 
---
Your dog loves you and assholes on comms are not more important than your family.
---
Too late. We're past the point of declaring an attack from a monster.
---
YA BLEW IT!
---
Why can't we have nice things, why do people have to do this kind of shit. Just let us enjoy stuff.
---
Grammar. It's a chore to read anything you write.
---
I am always with CCP. I love their work, how much they love this game and i know how painful might be for them, reading reddit for example.
---
I see too much lack of respect here. They are professionals, people like us. I am SURE that they try their best and they really want the best. People actually hurt them here.
---
They have A LOT of data, they know how to take better decisions than we can think about. Remember, they are also a company, they need to make $$.
---
Eve is literally a virtual masterpiece of mankind.
---
yeah, that was kind of silly actually.
---
spicy
---
I thought the guy that said ccp should change it from jump mass to jump count was a dumb ideabut wow, you're idea is even worse.
---
Where do these people come up with this stuff??
---
