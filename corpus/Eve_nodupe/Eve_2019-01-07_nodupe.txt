Seriously, though, you really have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about, you‚Äôre saying things that are flatly not true and don‚Äôt make a lot of sense, and you‚Äôre acting like the CSM has some special god powers to fix the game that we are choosing not to use because ??? reasons. 
---
The point of this roundtable was to get feedback from this portion of the community to give to CCP so they can use that info in their planning. CCP will make the decisions about how they want to restructure war decs. As for the rest of what you said, that‚Äôs all general nonsense griping that we hear everyday. Feel free to complain as much as you want, but that‚Äôs not the point of what we did here. As for not taking the job seriously, there have been two round tables this CSM term so far, and I‚Äôve been involved in putting together both. This was the only one that was open to the public. I‚Äôve made 95% of the meetings, review and comment on everything, eyd, and I‚Äôm the most visible guy on reddit, the forums, and all the EVE podcasts and twitch shows. I don‚Äôt know what else I‚Äôm supposed to be doing to show I take this seriously. I guess agree with you, but I‚Äôm only going to do that when you‚Äôre right and not being a douche canoe. 
---
With CCReee's recent track record, I wouldn't expect any of this to be fixed within the next 12 months.
---
i would like to pin this on top!!!  
---
I'm not looking for agreement.  I'm looking for someone who represents the community and not his slice of it.  But I guess I shouldn't expect so much from a turd who specializes in giving money to RL politicians who also ignore the community while focusing on their base.  You're a shit IRL and a shit in game.  Looking forward to your lack of employment in both come 2020.  Get at me.

You are claiming I state things that I never did, believing that horde is doomed, and insulting me on a personal level. That truly is embarrassing. It's a video game, mate. You are playing internet spaceships. Don't take it too seriously.

Realistically: you can lose lots doing it if you're a dumbo or you can work your way up to thirteen or fourteen figures. Depends on your skill, the effort you put into learning the market, and your capital (and no small amount on the whims and habits of your fellow capsuleers).

I region trade very casually using the wormhole connections I scout and semi-regularly flip a BR or T3D'd cargo bay worth of stuff for a few billion in profit. If I find a route to NPC null or deep low I'll usually check the area for stuff at historic lows and use a slippery ship to consolidate it for resale. I could make more just station trading, but being a genuine Thukker hobo is fun, I find. Khajiit has wares, etc.

Why would you bother fighting over a kspace fort anyway? Not like you have anything at risk as the defenders, or any loot to gain as the attackers.

Did season get released on prime?

Dscan dscan dscan.  Spam that v or whatever hotkey your dscan button is on.  If you see any probes, just hide, same for ships but you may not see them if it's a big system.
---
So, like a wardec tied to an empire? For example only minmatar space. Would provide an alternative to logging off.
---
But tbh, if these people want to pvp so badly, go to anywhere else than hisec. Ganking noobs to the point of leaving the game is beyond stupid.
---
Wars in hisec should focus on removing citadel spam and making logostics for null/wh groups difficult. And i think the current changes are good
---
 So what if people want to avoid wars? That too is a way to play the game, isk is shit in hisec anyways.

You can cloak as a alpha character? Or did I miss something in your story?

Fish...That is all.
---
You're on the right road, wormholes are pretty fun. When you get that astero fit it to be as quick aligning and fast as possible, to evade hunters. Then, when you have learnt more and want to start killing other explorers you can move to combat refits and such. Wormholes with HS statics near busy hubs are often camped, but if you go deeper into 'the chain' you can be pretty safe. D-scan and proper overview settings are your best friend.   
---

Don't fly an Astero until you're experienced at not losing exploration ships. A 2.5M loss is a lot easier to bear than a 90-130M one. Naturally, it shouldn't be undocked without a covert ops cloak. 
---
The Astero isn't necessarily the best ship for pure exploration - it's more expensive and slightly worse at scanning than a covert ops ship with Covert Ops IV/V. What it's great at is hunting down explorers while also having the option to do sites yourself if no targets appear. The Astero is very tanky for an exploration frigate thanks to its armour resistance bonuses, so if it's fitted with more resists and an armour repairer you can easily tank a lightly armed explorer or even some combat frigates.
---
I'm far from the most knowledgeable on exploration, but I take my exploration/hunting Astero into wormhole space and null all the time and very rarely lose one. If you have any further questions, I'd be happy to answer - the Astero is one of my favourite ships.
---
At least it's not an Erebus this time.
---
It seems NC don't want more. :(
---
Speaking of that, is that the only ship with bonuses to drugs?
---

[Shame mittens didn't realize that before he encouraged the player base to hunt down and harass another player to see if they would committed suicide in real life.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbYNLmtAMAw) I don't care when it happened, it was disgusting and should never have happened in the first place. CCP should have permanently banned him, no question. As long as he is still allowed to play and still running your alliance, it will forever be associated with that. Don't like it? Touch shit. Make him leave the game if you want goons to be known for something other than cyber bullying.

Waaaay back in... I want to say either 2009 or 2010, they demo'd an early version of it at fanfest. [Here's the trailer for that version of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oeghrHk7so); an expanded demo was at fanfest, though I can't remember whether it was before or after.
---
I believe it was Unreal-based, and included things like customizeable spaces for your corporation meetings and an RTS-esque minigame. There was some discussion of gambling via minigame and tradeable assets for your spaces.
---
Why this was quashed and they spent the next 2 years writing their own engine (Carbon) for it we can never know. I've heard speculation CCP didn't like being dependent on an outside license for anything in Eve (as opposed to the separate and licensed-engine Dust), and of course there was the long-persistent rumor that it was meant to be the basis for the World of Darkness game. It may simply have been a victim of CCP's internal "do it again" culture. We just don't know.
---
I roam goon space almost every day. The single.largest.botting.haven in the GAME casting the stone against someone for input broadcasting, largely because that same person has dented their pve operations considerably, is very ironic. It's like I am watching the pot call the kettle black.

Imagine if they expanded on the walk in station and allowed raids mass effect style?
---
So the structure thing is a permanent change?
---
What are we trying to solve then? At that point the reason for a defender to participate in the war is already done: to defend their structure.
---
A reason to participate is only needed if you can't make yourself immune to wardecs via not dropping structures.
---

Do you just go to regions and setup region buy orders?
---
I think most of us that started the game with wh exploration have this exact story, except that we died on the gate bubble :)
---
My tip would be to just keep scanning for the hi-sec wormhole exit instead of trying to go through low-sec because the final gate (the one connecting low/hi sec) is very often camped.
---
No you can't but i have a feeling he probably subbed halfway through this story, probably after the first wormhole when he realized he would need it for a cloak.

My niece spent 90 minutes on the character creation, played for 30 minutes, created another character because she "wasn't feeling the first one", and then never played again. She seemed to enjoy it. 
---
Exactly, very good point. Research your cloaking skills to level 4 so you can fit the covops cloaking device before you buy the astero, because people love to kill an astero if they see one.
---
You say this like daddy NC wasn't there holding Horde's hand.....
---
because what this game needs is more supers. Right.

Scope reports that capsuleers have taken to calling it the "F1 Booster", majority of large-fleet capsuleers report not noticing any effects whatsoever.

I tried to get my wife to play Eve. At about 90 minutes of character creation she stopped, looked at me exasperated and said "Don't you have a bunch of characters?!".
---
"Yeah, a few"
---
"How did you make them all?!"
---
I grabbed her mouse and clicked Random on all the options then clicked Next.
---
She stared blankly at the screen for a moment then said "I don't like this game." and walked away. 
---

Stick an alt in Jita who never leaves (or make an alpha account for this) and do your buying on that character. Contract it to your main character. Then create a courier contract and have it shipped. 
---
If you‚Äôre in low or null sec alliance you should have Corp/alliance shipping options available to you. 
---

Don't panic and keep scanning the chain, always going to the lowest class wormholes so you can find that hisec exit.

---
RvB had so much potential killed by war decs and I truly think bad planning, I really feel like the Devs should take over the RvB as some sort of 6 system fight that is a mini Faction war involving capturing systems by destroying the other sides Citadels. Each side owns 3 with the 2 systems next to each other  having the smallest then getting larger each one, with the last one being a Fort maybe I forget what sizes they are. 
---
Attack only the system next to the one you own and restrict ship size based on what Round you are on. So the first 2 systems you can only use Frigs and Destroyers, then the next size up add Cruisers and Battlecruisers, and for the final system you can use battleships. 
---
In order to attack a Citadel you need to hit some goal of pure pvp, either doing X geld worth of damage in ships or X ships I'm not sure just not how Fac war does it using pvp.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system.

Hey, it took me like 3 hours to create my main!
---
Agreed, mostly goons turbo krabbing out ahead of others.
---
But that's no good reason to play second fiddle. 
---
Haha, hey Brav!!!
---
Mostly because they are either doing it themselves, even though not all the time, but sometimes, and because they directly benefit from it. This is especially true for NS blocks. They tolerate and in a lot of cases even encourage botting / multiboxing (with input broadcasting) etc. etc. because they get direct cut of the resources from it in one form or another (very often rent payments for example).
---
They also basically publicly state that they do not do any of the above, when they actually do and continue for many months or even years at a time until the shit hits the fan and it blows up in their faces in which case they simply use the "we are too large, we didn't know" de facto status quo bullshit.
---
It is also 100% on CCP to remove the above mentioned resources and ISK or whatever else from the game when they ban the bots, but due to their complete and utter failure to do so, the bots / multiboxers / AFK ers or whatever else shit it is simply relocates and restarts, often times having enough warning to drain SP and inject new bots / multiboxers / AFK ers on same day or within few days at the most.

&gt; destroyer size dedicated Triglavian salvage ship
---
None of the dessies are dedicated Salvages. That's what the Noctis is for. Dessies were just "the cheapest ship with lots of Highs" for a long time.
---
They already came out with Trig CovOps and Recon... But they made them Trophy ships. Which means IF they do get around to making a complete line of ships instead of just sprinkling in a few now and then, they'll either have to come up with different stats from the existing ships. Or they'll just be giving away Trophy ships in mass, making the trophy ships very disappointing trophies.
---
As cool as it would be to have more ships, I don't think we're going to see a full line. More likely, they'll tag the ships Faction as they should be, and leave it with just a few.

---
Research...where you go to a building, work in a lab/office, get paid to do the bidding of a master or you're required to get grants for a master. 
---
Then when you ***finally*** win a grant you are required to adhere exactly to the grant contract that you have by a master. 
---
And at the end of the day you have no royalties for your discoveries, no residual earning for not overspending the grant. Those are taken as revenue by the academic institution you work for to by fancy cars for your masters.
---
You know the best part? The whole time you flaunt your Research PHd you will never get tenured unless you are born within the correct families.

I have been a pubbie, in RvB, and in multiple blocs, as well as some time in WH, FW, and some other things, but blocs suit my playstyle best. IMO blocs are easier than RvB, yes you can fail, expectations are low, and it's a mostly safe environment, but that is also super true of Horde. RvB does not keep you safe just because you're in high. RvB at least when I was in it has constant war decs, you would be safer ratting in null than doing anything in high with an RvB toon. Also, it's just easier to explain null mechanics than high sec mechanics. Safety, wardecs, concord, empire standings, gate guns (in low). In null you can shoot each other and that's about it. Explain bubbles, cynos, and that if they're in local and not blue they want you dead, easy, done. 
---
You will have not many people sad in Delve if you banned them all tomorrow.  Many of the massive multi-boxing people, independent of input broadcasting, are unpleasant to have in your system.  
---
It's good for corps yea. we are mainly using it for the roles set up and we can link it all though discord and Teamspeak so it syncs. really good.
---
Hell ya! 
---
rorqs prob don't input broadcast, I don't think it would see them. 
---
I built up a hub once, in an out of the way region. You need deep coverage, good logistics, reasonable prices, and a lot of patience. Took me the better part of year before I saw folks commonly hitting 'buy all'. When it finally came together I could pull .5-1b profit a day with 3 characters and about 100b invested. Advertise when you put stuff on market, be active in your corp/alliance trade channel, and find out what stuff folks want stocked.

Really? because i hardly ever see comments of goons or TEST claiming not to be blue. What i do see is a lot of comments like yours. People who claim that TEST and goons are blue.  
---
  
---
Anyway, it's been made very clear on numerous occasions that when it comes to shooting panfam, Goons and TEST join hands.   
---
The numbers were fine for the north this fight, there is no reason to complain.
---
Being completely serious, I would pretty much without reservation tell anyone who likes RPGs that EVE has *the* best character creator I have ever encountered. Not even because of the options for customization so much as the sheer ease of use.
---
No fucking around with sliders for 900 different goddamn things if you want a pointy ass nose you just grab that nose with your mouse and drag it out so it's as pointy-ass as can be.
---
Seriously that intuitive aspect of sculpting the character (because every other game that uses sliders the sliders are all *fucking DIFFERENT* even between entries in the same series) is so incredible that I wish that more games would make use of the Carbon creator.

That mac UI is super outdated. [This](https://old.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/abm4q5/plasma_yet_another_macos_clone/) one is current.

what?
---
I think the point here was there are moments where input broadcasting is completely fine and people make mistakes leaving it on after character selection. It might be worthy of a ban because it was in local but CCP has the final decision. 
---
Input broadcasting is fine for things that do not interact with the game world however. 
---
Ok, I'm no Goon fan, but why are you guys upvoting this Junk? 
---
&gt;you will instantly get kicked and permanently blacklisted
---
Is the conclusion drawn from [This Mittani fireside chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWCz3BBfmPE). I won't make you sit through 2 minutes of Alex, so here's the logs:
---
&gt;Goon Question: What should we do when we find a blue
---
bot? report to CCP? or report to our Diplo's? 
---
Alex: You should probably not be
---
reporting on your fellow goons because a
---
lot of times.... we've had to deal with this
---
before, people will see someone go 'oh
---
they're totally botting' 'oh they're
---
totally doing this'... 'We had actually a
---
problem and we don't know if we've resolved
---
this yet' But some self-righteous
---
douchebag decided to report everybody
---
that he thought was multi boxing, not
---
even, not even saying that these guys
---
were botting it's just like oh my god
---
they're running multiple accounts that's
---
*bad*, and just like some uppity fuckin
---
Church lady ran around... then petitioned a
---
whole bunch of his fellow goons because
---
he felt that he knew best, and he felt
---
like he could actually just look at a
---
group of people doing something, and
---
judge individually *as-if-they-knew* who
---
was botting, and who was multi boxing, and
---
who was good and who was bad. That person
---
is a piece of shit goon fucker traitor
---
because, you do not know what the other
---
person is doing on the other side of
---
their client. You do not know whether
---
they are using IS boxer correctly, or
---
whether they are actually violating the
---
EULA. You do not know the person who
---
is mining in the belt with you, were
---
ratting in a belt near you, or in an
---
anomaly. You don't know whether they're a
---
bot or not. Don't fucking report on your own people.
---
Don't be a self-righteous piece of shit.
---
Don't be that guy, and I'm not gonna
---
apologize for being a dick about that,
---
Marcus Hayabusa, because that is a very
---
dangerous kind of question that you have
---
asked. You are not the judge jury or the
---
executioner. You do not get to decide
---
what other people in your alliance are
---
doing, or not doing, because you have no
---
idea what's going on
---
TLDR: He doesn't like Goons reporting other Goons, he thinks that CCP can deal with it, without potential drama being formed internally
---
My analysis: He doesn't mention kicking, banning, or blacklisting. He does say, if you do that, you're a piece of crap - and I've seen no evidence for Goons acting out the first claim. From a military perspective, I've seen 'tattling' gravely affect group cohesion, and functionality. As an example, during the Afghan war, an officer was charged for a 'mercy killing':
---
&gt;[a small band of Canadian troops mentoring a company of Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers‚Äîencountered an unidentified man lying on a dirt path. He had been shot out of a tree by a U.S. Apache helicopter, and in the words of one eyewitness, was ‚Äú98 per cent‚Äù dead.
---
Canadian soldiers are bound by the Geneva Conventions and the military‚Äôs own code of conduct to offer First Aid to all casualties, friend or foe. But the senior Afghan officer on the scene decided that the man was too wounded to save, telling the others: ‚ÄúIf Allah wants him, he will die. If not, he will live.‚Äù In his capacity as a mentor, Semrau had no authority to overrule the ANA commander.](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/capt-robert-semrau-dismissed-from-the-forces/)
---
Should he have done it? Who knows. It put his subordinates in an awkward position, from the article:
---
&gt;At one point, Perron(Judge) specifically criticized Semrau for putting his subordinates in the difficult predicament of either tattling on their commander or keeping quiet
---
In the end, a Canadian told, Semrau was charged with murder, people/troops were generally unhappy, and life for the 'snitch' wasn't great. I see some parallels between what Alex is getting at, and this situation(plus I'm sure the botting income doesn't hurt :P)

I've spent maybe three hours total over my ten characters. I have it down to a fine art. I tend to pick during the beginning my characters family to match the one I like the look of best (except the snooty/elitist line, hate them) and then it's as little clicks as possible.

A producer can buy an option for a property's TV rights for very little money when that can be done, and then hold that option for years with nothing but talk and promises. The same producer can buy the rights for dozens of such properties. And then only make the TV series if the property goes viral or something else happens to make it likely that the show will be profitable.

You know what other video game has had its option purchased for a TV show for years? Halo. Want to hear another? Minecraft. Out of those two and EVE, which do you suppose would be made first? Other video games which have been optioned: Little Nightmares, Costume Quest, Megaman, Hitman (this one is actually likely to happen), Battlefield, Vampyr, Street Fighter (again), and, of course, The Witcher.

It is when you have multiple accounts and send the same signal to them with 1 button. It used to be legal in the game but a handful of players were warping the meta of the game too much by multi-boxing 7-21 bombers at once.

#STOP BITING MY SHIT
---
Reminds me of the stories from my early days exploring :) I kept going on mostly the exploration path, so here's some advice from the top of my head:
---
* Like some other guys already said, the Astero is not necessarily the best exploration ship. Don't get me wrong, it's absolutely great (think of it as an excellent combat frigate with very good exploration stats), but it's also an expensive loss (and until you get more experience, you'll definitely lose a few ships to others). A covert ops will scan slightly better, be much cheaper, be more maneuverable, and warp faster (my point of reference is the Helios, I'm not 100% sure about the other covops ships and too lazy to check...). I'd recommend sticking to T1 exploration frigs for now because they're extremely cheap, and training for covert ops ships, which are not all that expensive either. You should have the money to buy and fit plenty by the time you have the skills to do so. When you feel comfortable enough flying around safely in hostile space, you can confidently move on to the Astero.
---
* In my experience, what the Astero excels at is hunting other explorers. Upgrading to an Astero is an excellent time to start learning how to kill your competition while exploring. You won't forget the adrenaline rush from your first kills ;) Having some previous exploration experience will help greatly with that.
---
* Get to know the different kind of sites you could run into so that you know what you can clear and how. This particularly applies to sleeper caches and ghost sites, which are very different from your usual relic/data sites. Trying those without the appropriate ship/fit/knowledge will get your ship blown up, guaranteed. And these can be extremely lucrative, so you _really_ don't want to blow your ship on those.
---
* In low/null sec, always watch local for the list of players. If there are other people in the system, but few enough (let's say 5 tops, ideally less), it might still be safe-ish to explore. You should look up the other players on zkillboard to get a feel of what to expect from them. If they're routinely killing explorers, move the fuck on. If the other pilots in system appear to be carebears, you may proceed, but always with caution. If someone else moves into the system while you're running a site, be ready to gtfo at the first sign of trouble or before if you have a lot of valuables and want to minimize the risk of losing it.
---
* No matter where you are, mash the everloving fuck out of your dscan button. Press it every couple of seconds if you can. It feels like a chore at first, but it'll soon become completely automatic, I don't even need to think about it anymore. `V` is the default keybind.
---
* Read [this](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormhole_Space). Skim through the wormhole related content on the wiki. Get to know wspace mechanics as well as you can.
---
* Make an overview preset to use with your dscan tailored to show only the things you need to worry about. Typically when I'm exploring, I want my dscan to show enemy ships (duh), probes (indicates someone else is exploring around, or possibly trying to track you down), wrecks (indicates recent player activity), drones (player activity also, or stranded drones from a player kill) and corpses which I believe the game calls biomass (indicates a player kill). The rest is noise. You could have an additional preset to show structures such as POSes and citadels to get a feel for what's around when your first enter a system, but when you're actively scanning for player activity, you really want your dscan to only show things indicating player activity.
---
* Always expect the unexpected. Just because you saw no signs of activity in a wormhole whatsoever does not mean that you are safe. There could be a stealthy motherfucker like me who already scanned down the whole system, ready to pinpoint your position with dscan and jump on you without ever giving you a single clue as to my presence before uncloaking. Never let your guard down and always be ready to react within a split second.
---
* While performing the hacking minigame, do not ever let it take away your focus from your overview and dscan. These remain your priority at all times. Why ? Because assholes like me know that hacking is when people drop their guard, and will wait until you've started the hack to attack you as you're more likely to take too much time to react.
---
* Use a tool like [pathfinder](https://www.pathfinder-w.space/). It's worthwhile, even solo, as it gives you a ton of useful information all condensed in a neat dashboard. It will let you know of any recent kills in the system, provide you with quick links to the killboards and other useful tools (dotlan and anoik.is come to mind), and tell you which statics are present in a given wormhole system.
---
* When jumping into a new wormhole system, there's a few things to do before you start scanning:
---
** Bookmark your entrance. ALWAYS.
---
** The presence of citadels/POSes hints that someone might live there, and these people are very likely to have all the anomalies already scanned down. These people will be able to get the jump on you without even having to drop probes (which would show on your dscan, which would tell you to be very very careful). If you suspect someone lives here and is hanging around, be even more on the lookout than usual or avoid the system altogether if your cargo hold already contains a lot of valuables.
---
** Checking the killboards will let you know of any recent kills, and if so, what kind of opponent to expect. They could also help you in determining who, if anyone, lives there and evaluate how dangerous they might be.

Shit, that got long.

Thanks for the treatise Aristotle but you're missing a key bit of context there. You quoted the entire bit from mittani - but you neglected to mention the disconnect between the _action_ he was prescribing (don't report blues) and the _harm_ he was alleging (blue fucking). 
---
The blue fucker Mittani quoted (which, by the way, no one had ever heard of. I suppose he just thinks we take his word for it?) was doing something possibly bad - reporting blues he _thought_ were botting because, in Mittani's words, he couldn't tell who was good and who was broadcasting. Ok. That's not the issue, though. The issue is that Mittani's _own alliance member_ asked what to do when they suspected a corp mate of botting. Not "should I blue fuck my entire alliance based on a hunch." 
---
&gt; My analysis: He doesn't mention kicking, banning, or blacklisting. He does say, if you do that, you're a piece of crap - and I've seen no evidence for Goons acting out the first claim. From a military perspective, I've seen 'tattling' gravely affect group cohesion, and functionality. As an example, during the Afghan war, an officer was charged for a 'mercy killing':
---
What the actual fuck. Mittani didn't _have_ to say "don't do this or you'll be banned" in the same way your superior officers don't have to say "do what I say or you'll be punished." They're _fucking in charge_ so the things they say _carry consequence._ If you needed your superiors to say "do what I say or these specific consequences will happen" you might be a cucumber.

You mean the guy who owns one of the biggest cloaky camper account(s) is using software to automate behaviour in game.
---
Well I am for one absolutely shocked at this rare occurrence. It makes total sense that he alt-tabbed into multiple channels to say the same sentence out of context within said channels...
---
Where is the burden of proof.. screenshots are photoshopped... logs are editable by notepad.... we need absolute proof in that a GM has to be sitting behind him at his desk ... as without that it's just allegations people :)
---
how long are you usually sitting on inventory? I feel like moving to a dead end system would result in you just not moving anything 
---
so that bubble u escaped. you did the right thing. 
---
now a tip to get better. 
---
align out. hit your cloak. immediately hit your micro warp drive. it will put you at a huge speed towards where you have aligned. since you are in a frigate. unless the best of gate camps cant de-cloak you fast enough.
---
now his works on how the server works. in 1 second ticks. no actions matter in-between. 
---
since you are allowed to activate any non offensive module in the fist tick you activate you cloak. you get the use of that module. so now you are moving away faster while cloaked for the duration of the MWD. that is 10 seconds. 
---
remember the first ting you have to do when you beak your gate cloak. when you align out is to hit your cloak back up so you are not targeted. and hit your mwd within the next tick ( second ) cloaking back up. 
---
try it out in hi sec gates to get the hang of it. 
---
now when some one is actively trying to approach you and de-cloak you. assuming you have cloaked back up and hit your micro-warp drive. the people who are tying to de-cloak will assume the location you are moving towards and burn there to de-cloak you, if they know what they are doing they will in-deed approach you in blazing speeds and de-cloak you. now you have one last trick to avoid getting caught. once you aligned out and moving with your mwd. align out in a different direction than of that you initially aligned. thus changing your vector. moving up or down helps most of the time. 
---
learn to use the Q button. instead of double clicking in space. 
---
have fun brave explorer. fell in love with WH's the first time in entered them. still there. and carry a extra set of probes. the probe launcher will auto reload and you don't have to waste time breaking your cloak to reload probes every-time you start scanning and also will help u if you forget to pull probes.

They literally broke some of the most important components of the game and have done nothing about it for almost a full year now. I took a break to let them figure that shit out and since they never fixed it I have had little reason to come back and pay close to $50 per month to resub my accounts to a legitimately broken game.

I run into lots of SoCals on other games. There's actually quite a few Eve players in the PNW, on the discord and such.

Worth mentioning that if you go to the industry window and look at facilities within skill range, it bugs out and displays pretty much every structure in New Eden. I have a range of 15 jumps for production, but I can see stations some 30 jumps away.
---
Find a wh Corp accepting newbies otherwise my advice is not to join a Corp at all. Keep doing your solo thing and maybe look into faction warfare or incursions for group activities. Faction warfare would be more accessible to new players. 
---
You‚Äôre right, null is just a giant circle jerk. The politics suck and the required activities are annoying. Instead you could just cloaky ninja around null and run relic/data while talking shit in local and have 10x more fun.

even if you did he'd just put a new one up the next day

If you want more engaging ratting then you go for burner missions, incursions ams abyssal sights. Some of those are the best ink in the game. Mining allows you to watch Netflix whilst still logged in as long as you have two screens. I do both depending on my level of engagement. Reactions are still the thing you do once you can invest 10 billion. Production is at the mercy of the ore prices and the market price for products but is another long game play style. Exploration is an average of poor returns to Extremely great returns and averages out over time to be as good as mission running. It all depends on your play style what you choose to do. Most of it averages out to be about $40 to$50 million per hour in bullseye once you add in downtime and docking up dodging bad guys etc.

I didnt find it on mobile phone, but this is good to know. Looking for it will entertain me for the week.

This is closer to the truth than it might seem.

Originally The Expanse was a pitch for an MMO designed specifically to compete against Eve.  It was never made.
---
..then it was an unfinished tabletop RPG
---
..then it became the successful book series
---
..and now the TV series!
---
Not yet.
---
Did you just assume my gender?
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Eve-Uni, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on highsec, and I have over 300 confirmed zkillboard kills. I am trained in mining warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire game. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies in highsec and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can mine in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in mining, but I have access to the entire arsenal of ORE and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of eve, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.
---
To a single empire or even a much smaller region of space like a constellation or say 5 jumps around a certain system. That way you wouldn't even need the structure requirement and those who have no interrest in spaceship PVP still have lots of places to go and can continue playing. That way you also wouldn't lose wars between smaller entities who want another competing corp out of their system (if you scrap the structure requirement that you wouldn't need anymore).
---
As for the wardeccers: I don't think they understand how grave the situation really is for them if I look at their suggestions.
---
It‚Äôs why PL have Rate my Ticks, for their alts. Black Legion spends a lot of time doing burner missions and so on. They‚Äôre all krabbing but won‚Äôt admit it publicly.
---
Where's the gate to Stain?
---
For some people their goal or their winning at Eve thing is to get to be one of the richest in game. It‚Äôs a gameplay that for instance many Goon Thetans take as a measure of pride. To blow up a faction capital you own just because you can is pretty impressive. Better than NC. Docked being ordered not to undock them.

Bind mousewheel to focus next window then scoop with alternating steps so each input = 1 action. How fast can you spin the mousewheel? But this would mostly likely go under accelerated gameplay.
---
then if it isn't staying - how are we going to justify a bond system whereby you're looking at astronomical fees in order to 'make it worth it' for the defender if we go with a bond system?
---
There are a few years since i last played, but i remember having oversized tank on doctrine ships, so that would be Large SE on cruisers and mediums on frigates.

how about we just balance the ships we already have?

when i read that i thought to myself so why did i get a hel dropped on my retribution and loki aaaaaaa

It's really sad to sit on the outside and watch CCP slowly strangle this game. I always hoped it would still be here when I had time to play again.
---
But at what cost... I mean those skins are expensive...

It *used* to be like this.
---
OP, the Rorqual uses "Excavator" class mining drones, which let's uit mine at the rate as like 8 hulks, for probably around the same price as 8 hulks, assuming you don't bling it out needlessly.
---
my eye twitched a little too
---
Oh boy, a whole 16 ships/2.8b lost! 
---
If you're doing moon extractions it's very possible to earn 50 or 100 mil an hour in a hulk, with boosts from a Porpoise (cheap but effective mining boost ship) putting you at the high end of that scale.
---
I spent about an hour and 15 minutes mining R32 ore with two Procurer alts and a Porpoise and made 122 mil. A hulk without boosts could probably do 60mil imining the same ore.
---
Says who?
---
After BB got awoxed and smarted few days ago i think he said something about being paid to camp delve and was gonna leave but due to the awox he's gonna bring all his hundred and something alts in.

Trading hubs in null-sec are a thing. Big alliances will have a staging system, and a lot of people who produces locally, or does jump freighter runs from Jita, will seed the market with everything from armor hardeners to faction battleships and skillbooks of all kinds.

When's the last time they won a fight?  Provi?

I'm not even sure Panfam is still capable of winning anything other farming weak alliances and new players.  Let's poke 'em a bit and find out.

@Sibire 34:20 on your video, "Primary at the Beginning" was mostly all me. I agree with your corp mate, I don't like like reactive hardeners on Drekavacs because they are the first to get nueted by the bhaalgorns. But in this fight because most of the damage you took was Thermal &amp; Explosive from my drekavac alone, so the reactive hardener was super useful in this fight. If you look back at the kill mail: Falcon 98,528 damage done (It would've been higher but the reactive hardener mitigated alot of the damage).  The Zarmazd pilot was probably a huge reason you stayed alive through the damage, I use gunnery implants that increase the drekavac's damage to 1,500/sec at full spool with Tech II occult ammo. 
---
Look at you going around this post calling everyone's posting bad. Maybe everyone is not the problem.

1) The warp-in bug has ships appearing at their warp-in point instantly while they're actually still landing (and letting you see them land from a direction). The animation is a mess and broken. Sometimes they come in from the wrong direction, sometimes they instantly appear, sometimes they land normally - the whole process of ships landing from warp is broken since Permafrost.
---
2) Dscan messes up with showing ranges for ships that you have been on grid with. It retains the range it thinks the ship is at. Even if the ship is not on grid with you any more, it will show a distance as if it is - which means it might show a ridiculous 50+ AU range on your dscan window if both of you warped around from your original spots. Dscan results are still accurate, if you ignore the distance shown.
---
3) The sensor overlay sometimes does not load properly after you enter a system. It will half-load anomalies/structures/etc. but you cannot right-click them in space to warp to them. You have to manually disable and enable the sensor overlay to refresh it, then it usually loads things fully.

You get an upvote. All of Signal Cartel want a Sisters of EVE destroyer. Do you know what we could do with an armor resist tanked small laser turret/drone/hacking/scanning bonused  destroyer in C2-5 Wolf-Rayets? Absolutely astonishing things. :)

As a huge fan of yours Omeca you have really let yourself down here. When people cheat they cheat, the fact you even bring up the issue of Goons reporting it is truely pathetic. I couldn't give two fucks who your aligned with, if your that much of a faggot you need to cheat then get the fuck off our game.

All bigger alliances have "buyback programs", where you can sell your ore and ice at fixed conditions - usually a percentage of a Jita price. The exact conditions depend on the individual buyback programs. It's  usually a less than 100% Juta buy price for ore, but there are much more valuable ores than in HS, so you still earn more. Ice prices may even be higher than in Jita.
---
Often the buyback is just an option and you are allowed to export stuff yourself to HS if you want, but some groups restrict exports and expect you to either use your stuff locally or sell to the buyback.

But do you see the issue here? Regardless of who your issue is with we all agree that this is wrong. Regardless what flag we pretend to be part of. We can rip on Goons and others all we want, the issue is that people are using these methods ingame and they should be removed. The fact that an FC of one of the biggest NPSI fleets has to use input broadcasting is pathetic, and he should be removed from the game. Just the same as anyone else should, whether they are just krabbing or autistic enough to own that many accounts.
---
I won't apologize for finding a one time incident much more unimportant compared to all the goon Rorqual broadcasting and calling out the hypocrisy here. My official position has been that if CCP bans this guy they should also check out the activity of all the Goon rorquals we have been reporting. That's how you take a meaningful stance against cheaters.
---
Well that would of taken precedence considering CCP seem to think you can get a chance after getting caught once. 
---
kill me
---
&gt;except that we died on the gate bubble
---
Don't worry. OP's story involves that as well. He just hasn't gotten to that part yet.
---
Its all on the same level. Like you hunt them in Delve, someone has provided very nice evidence for him doing the same. The only difference lays your motive. Considering the fact people like yourself put an entity like goons into 1 playstyle and play type it is no suprise they are jumping on this at all. This is just a prime example where we let conflicts in a game affect our decisions on important stuff like this. We claim Eve is dying but the prevalent issue is people using exploits like this.
---
I know him and why he is using broadcasting. He is doing it to log in the game with 100 accounts. That's actually legal by CCP. He just forgot to turn it off after that.
---
Meanwhile, hundreds of rorquals in delve keep mining despite our reports and serverlog proof that they are broadcasting. And the very same people come here bash mar5hy. That's the real issue here. thanks
---
Yep. But it's also been optioned for a TV series.
---
https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/hitman/268955/hitman-tv-series-set-for-hulu-from-john-wick-creator-derek-kolstad
---
Well then the issue seems to be how a guy is sad enough to have +100 accounts on Eve, at that point your pretty much lost to the world anyway. Good day to you.
---
that was before l played lol, thats why l would like to see it back there 
---
Its more like two groups that have been constantly attacked by PanFam are teaming up to shoot PanFam. That PanFam finds themselves outnumbered just breaks my heart.
---
Afk camping with 100 accounts is a much interesting way to play the game compared to rorqual mining with 15 accounts. And I am not here to judge the way people play anyway.
---
Years ago I made 20. But that was before the nerf.
---
Or you could just go shoot someone and play the game 
---
In my ideal world all broadcasters should be banned. But I prefer nobody being banned over only mar5hy being banned just because goons can lead a strong metagame campaign. CCP doesn't take our reports of Goon Rorquals zeriously but just because you can make a strong Reddit post about it you will get him banned. That's a double standard and has nothing to do with how i don't like goons etc.
---
He is camping to shoot people, which is more than you can say about mining all day
---
Purge Shared Cache?

Basically many people don't do the abyss sites because issues you stated and the fact that there will be no reimbursements like ever.

---
When a corp closes any pocos they own become interbus pocos.
---
I can understand that mate. The issue with this game is either side will use that metagaming to get at each other. But years of ingame conflicts will drive people to that level. As you said everyone should be treated the same, its just a shame we divide into two sides about it. The narrative doesn't matter at the end of the day. The issue here is Mar5hy fucked up in plain sight with easy evidence provided. I'd be shocked if this got very far at all but you are correct with the imperium holding the louder voice here.
---
Again. He fucked up. But if CCP doesnt care about rorqual broadcasters they shouldn't care about him. If CCP bans him then they should ban rorqual broadcasters.

hey now, the endurance and prospect are great... They're just not designed with *m3* in mind. If you're using them in a place safe enough where that matters, then you're doing it wrong and want a barge - at least, IMO.

I mean you're not wrong, it gives some players advantages over others so it becomes an unfair mess. Delete local completely.
---
Trig dread./u/deltaxi65
---
Take into consideration that you're gonna have to watch that Rorq sit on the rock like a hawk. Your most valuable asset is not the Rorq hull, it's the Excavator drones. One comes at \~910m and you need 5 of them. They're squishy. They're slow. And they can be stolen from you by Booshers. Unless you're planning on expanding your mining crew to like 5+ Rorqs or something, you're just gonna hate yourself.   
---
You might as well get a supercarrier instead and make a lot more bank in the same sitting.  
---
Take that from someone who used the Christmas skill injector accelerators to extract Rorq skills from his two alts.

I've actually wanted something like this for a while - I'm pretty good at getting into and out of troublesome spots in my hauling ships - moreso than quite a few of my friends. Been more than one occasion where I have had friends for various reasons that needed to move somewhere far away but were stuck in some isolated corner of the universe surrounded by trouble.

idk if they still are but my corp has been reporting exceptionally-high levels of fuckery in jita /shrug
---
you must not be watching the stream

maybe, maybe not
---
but either way your posting is considerably worse than mine
---
and I know bad posting
---
oh boy is this the part where I tell you that tapi armor supercaps moved with the first move fleet because your alliance doesn't tell you anything?
---
He just wants the delve wormhole generator gone. 
---
All I'm saying. Will cut down on the amount of reporting people do to get their shit back which is less work for CCP total. Either fix local or just delete it.
---
personally I actually gatecamp in tenerifis
---
if your point was that xdeath might as well be npcs then well played but if you were trying to take a jab at rtsq then you're actually retarded sorry mate
---
3\* but as a Rorqual pilot and person that is just bad at organizing and managing multiple things, I prefer to pay more to do in a single account the work of 4.

Shuttles without Doomsdays? Fucking retards everywhere smh

Probably got bored
---
one could argue that the information he provided is not traceable, therefore it is not personal information. 
---
Even though the GDPR is way more harsh on the definition of "personal information" (pseudonyms are also traceable since they are assigned to real personal data), the website itself does not have that kind of data (besides IP-Logs, email address - due to sign-up process).   
---
Therefore it should be quite easy to get out of this.   
---
Just your typical krab drama, they were cherrypicking ores and some half empty paper pusher bitched about it.

congrats on giving the free intel, retard

I think Black Desert Online has been said to have the best character creation. I also heard FF14 too but i dont know?

Without Tri I don't think Skillu have a great content source but probably have to stick around a bit to secure their rental area.
---
Some of them left to make their own corp in skillu (the one that got 3 kills before the Victor loss lol). And Volta are returning to Thera afaik.
---
As if it wasn't obvious enough already lmao
---
Bdo has great looking characters, I still find eve online more intuitive, aion was also definitely ahead of its time
---
Mining drama
---
Make no mistake, this seems to just be someone trying to weaponize GDPR to cause someone he or she has a grudge against in-game a real-world problem. 
---
kind of. skill farming off of 3 chars per account nets at worst 90% of the isk to plex+mct, and is even profitable at times.
---
So once a char is where you want it at skill-wise (rorqs, L5 barghests etc), you have an essentially free account on which you may choose to do pve on at leisure which translates into sp that you can choose to not extract at the end of the month - or spend on ships or whatever.
---
Grinding makes sense if (A) you enjoy the pve (B) make less than about $20/h at work (1.5-2b/h is reasonable income without rorq spamming) (C) would rather grind in eve than be at stressful job. Obviously if you are vni/carrier/super ratting, or solo mining, hands down it fails (B), just buy plex.
---
It doesn't explain the increasing stack of other bugs though. I am pretty skeptical that it's all coming from the service provider. 
---
How much did you have to pay daddy china to be let on this one?
---
Yeah it's a shame cos the abyss sites are the only interesting pve in the game you can so solo. Even the pirate fobs are tedious as you can just ignore the rats and focus damage on the fob as long as you keep repping each other. I've only lost about 600m in abyss sites in total, half due to my own mistakes half due to a socket closure and even that is enough to make me not want to bother doing any more
---
This, ladies and gentleman,  deserves an upvote!
---
eggs tea, notice me 
---
&gt;The most hilarious part of this issue is that it does actually look like the corp may have to deal with it as the request pertains to personally identifiable information stored on its corp/guild website
---
this is literally a legit gdpr request lmao, from the title i thought they'd gdpr'd their in-game shit or something, what a trash article
---
I mean its still fucking amazing.
---
No ship is supposed to be able to fit a full rack of tachyons without gimping itself - they‚Äôre oversized. The mega beam is the direct equivalent of 425mm rail or 1400mm arty, and there‚Äôs no problem fitting that with a beastly buffer.
---
Also, if Machs weren‚Äôt so massively favoured for their warp speed/acceleration, on a cost/alpha basis an arty abaddon massively outperforms them, and they have been flown as doctrine by several alliances historically.
---
Noctis is something of a cruiser / BC size and handles as clunky as a BS, hence there is a very serious spot open for a small, fast salvage ship, one that can use 5 salv drones to boot.
---
And I'm well aware of the trophy ships, but I think their regular counterparts would have some less stats on them or a different stat set, much like otehr trophy ships in the game.
---
Two points:
---
* The Astero is more maneuverable than a T2 covert ops frigate, it can easily get an align time below 2 seconds, without using rig slots. This makes it a bit harder to catch. Also everybody knows he will win against a T2, an Astero might be feared by some and not attacked. I also think that the T2 is more cost efficient, but some prefer Astero for these reasons.
---
* Don't dirscan "every couple of seconds". Hit that V key every single second, no exceptions. First, that's safer. Second, you don't need to watch the overview while hacking, then. Watching the dirscan window is enough.
---
Also, i had a similar problem, turned out to be two routers on the same wifi, with both of them wanting to assign ip adresses. So that would periodicly dc me.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBbwZCRIILM
---
SOE is kinda boring, same ol lazerz on em, though they do look kinda pretty and I do agree that there is a lack of full explo bonused desi in the game in general. I feel they should have made that into another "mode" on the current T3Ds, give em better scan, and hacking bonuses along with more sensor strength.
---
The thing about Trig ships though is the spool up gun. Most fun thing to shoot in the game, hands down no comparison. Although that might be jsut because we've shot everything else for so many years now that it just feels this way, but hey, I'll take it.
---
Still working?

I got back to the game since I haven't played for 2 years. I have a retriever and I'm mining in an highsec island (I think it's called like that). I know the basics of mining but... How should I sell it? Should I reprocess it? Where should I sell whatever I got?
---
If you have a fittings channel in-game, you can set up sales on your market for the complete fit, which then allows your members to right-click "Buy All" the fit. It's pretty convenient for buying multiple fits as well. The thing is to always be stocked. Your customers need to have confidence that you have what they need.
---
Cruiser hull strategic stealth bombers with capital sized missiles! 
---

More of a meme really.

In theory yes, but they have special rules that make them more like a battleship when it comes to traveling and docking
---
Lol never not be a faggot Calmatt
---
Can they argue that all data is related to his character and not the person as a individual?
---
Absolutely true, they spent serious effort into introducing what could develop into the best PVE mechanic in years, then decide to ensure that a large proportion of those who WOULD do it, will not, by introducing a ‚ÄúRussian roulette‚Äù mechanic that is totally dependent on CCP‚Äôs servers having a 99.9999 uptime, and the ISP (good luck with that) And no DDOS‚Äôs, and....and..... maybe in a hundred years, when the internet and CCP are totally resilient, and they have fixed local, then it might become popular.

[ "Ripper" Implant Harvester]
---
This piece of technology was first issued by the Servant Sisters of EVE in YC 119 after as series of discoveries in the wormhole systems [REDACTED]. Its very delicated manufacturing process can only be done in C4 wormhole systems and requires additionally certain environmental effects which affect the capabillites of a finished module. After locking a capsuleer corpse, this module has a chance to extract one damaged implant from the body, should there been one in the first place. The implant can be repaired using additional, rare materials found in Wormhole space. This module can only be fitted on the "Equinox" body barge, issued by the S.O.E. in late YC 119. 
---
whew kid calm down  
---
Large shield extenders are normal for cruisers, battlecruisers and battleships.

Medium shield extenders are normal for frigates.

---
This is the answer to the question above, for anyone who missed it
---
I dunno have you seen how some faggots pvp... 
---
I'm having fun, how about you?
---
There's actually a reasonably extensive discussion in there about the legitimacy (or not) of GDPRing in-game stuff. It was brought about by a statement in the original post saying that the person wanted all records of their existence removed, which would naturally include any character information.
---
Something I noticed was that the first few times I did the abyssals they seemed to load a bunch of resources (the circle in bottom left) could it be this that is causing a problem?
---
If you wanted to try and ‚Äòfix‚Äô it you could run some T1s in something dirt cheap
---
In short, this game is a mess.

thats the point if you join a null bloc you doesnt have to care much.. thats the problem. AND thats the point of RvB to have a wardec In H-sec sooo...

macros are not allowed, binding a key to re-bind itself to another key and at the same time press a key is a macro.

Not if they have his e-mail address or other identifying information about the person behind the character.
---
Taking into account how long this bug is in the game now a better idea would be to just delete the game and forget about it. CCP has reached silly levels of incompetence, injecting the game with multiple bugs at once while doing an "update". The fact that they got sold off ot a foreign company won't make things better in the long run.
---
He's confused by the non-ruse flair.  Don't mind him.
---
It's also worth noting that because gila is the meta and many of those gilas run firestorms, firestorm filaments and loot are much cheaper than say, dark or electrical stuff. So running things besides firestorm might ultimately net you more over time.
---
&gt;This

i somehow thought, nah, thats a joke. but no. trackpants. there you go.

I usually run 3-4 accounts by default, like i never login to a single account after so many years.

I get constant DC, CL and various minor bugs.

I often have 3 accounts running ok and one totally bugged.

Quite often a mouse cursor is getting locked in one of the clients and i need to force session refresh to unlock it.

Rubber banding ... i love landing on the same gate for the 4th time, or getting a warp tunnel between empty systems ... and seeing on 2nd account the 1st account sitting on the gate totally targetable ... i love how i can warp this first account back to citadel (the one in warp tunel) just to dock and wait this fucking countdown there.

No eve is not bugged ... it is bugged as hell.

back then a intact was 16 mil...they switch from magnetometrics to relic sites and got like 3000 intacts sitting in stain,waiting for introduction of t2 capital rigs...bad move, they went down to 2 mil(intacts)....rektttt
---
Short answer :
---
- If you have shit reprocessing skills, you're probably better off selling the ore rather than trying to reprocess and sell the mineral
---
- You need to find a somewhat active market hub in your HS island and sell it there
---
- You should get the gallente hauler with ore cargo to move ore on a not painful way
---
Not direct answer :
---
- Join a corp, they will most likely have a buy back program
---
- You probably should not mine in HS and should head for NS
---
Goddamn, this made me lol pretty hard. Thanx.
---
all about damn miners....everithyng in eve  this days evolve around minning...what a time to be...subscribed
---
So one violation is justification for another violation ? :) The Kenshin Friends needed a few month to realize that they have zero impact, and their salt wont change anything in Delve.
---
NC.'s Pet will do the same.
---
There's also a "Blueprints" channel in game, can be worth chatting there with the volume, price looking to pay, and frequency if it's more than a one time thing. If anyone can meet your criteria, they'll then message you and hammer out details of when/where/how much. 
---
Even just slinging a copy-edited message there when you log in before doing the research against active contract issuers might get a faster result.
---
If I remember correctly it was atleast 4-5 months ago and it got downvoted to oblivion and thne magically dissappeared from the sub reddit. Someone turbo autist will have it saved I'm sure.

My "leader" told us not to report everyone who whe are assuming is a bot, because he maybe warped a second earlier in my next site. But yeah, you dont need bots in Geminate, when ZEBRA is literally raping your VNI Stash on a daily base.

Ah and we also shutdowned your Kalevala Renting Bots. 
---
is dieng for real this time
---
/u/ccp_falcon Enforce your rules, show us that you care.
---
&gt;Don't fly an Astero until you're experienced at not losing exploration ships. A 2.5M loss is a lot easier to bear than a 90-130M one.
---
Great advice!
---
16mil? hmm i remember that i was running those sites in a apocalypse (lol) with a data analyzer fitted (lol^ ^lol)
---
Or you are PH and you're selling an Avatar in O-V for 50 mil via Station Trade.
---
The same can be said for the last time mar5hy was caught doing it when it got downvoted by his turbo nerds and the thread was magically removed from this sub :turbo_thinking:
---
Regardless if it's someone input broadcasting rorqs in any group/alliance or someone camping in any group/alliance they should be banned for it!

The more concerning notion is why are wormhole alliances ironically harbouring bots?
---
Extremelly happy for them - V0LTA belongs in Thera
---
Wormhole alliances protecting bots rofl, 2019 everyone
---
What's the deal with him?
---
Beware high sec slave groups that have mandatory buyback programs and just collect taxes on you.
---
A good alliance will have a Ship Replacement Program, where they subsidize ships you lose on fleets.  They'll have an out of game notification system where they send "pings" when fleets are forming. 
---
I recommend Brave Newbies, Brand Newbros (TEST), Dreddit (TEST), Karmafleet (Goons), Pandemic Horde, or EVE University.
---
All except EVE University are null and own territory and structures for you to use.  But going straight into null is fine for a newbie.
---
Any of those alliances should have a mentor program and chat rooms where you can ask questions.
---
&gt;using laws literally
---
welcome to the world
---
Funny shit where?
---
I don't get it :(
---
Really most people should be able to manage on $11/month (yearly sub), sometimes two.  Most alliances will subsidize your ships if you lose them during fleets, so you don't need *that* much isk to keep running.
---
Was solo blopsing the other day, ceptor warps in, cynos in erebus with carrier/fax suport... not even in delve!
---
I‚Äôm still in a ‚Äúhub,‚Äù it‚Äôs just a very quiet area.  But if you want something off the market, you still have to come to me.  I usually restock once a week.
---
Our corp has been on a steady decline due to being n0funs battered wife, short term our corp application to hard knocks should go through within a week while we prepare to make the transition into a top one thousand raid guild in Kronos WoW.
---
I appreciate the downvotes for sharing my actual experience.  
---
The only thing we can do to send a message is letting accounts go alpha. Those in charge at CCP clearly don't care about delivering a high quality game, so the only way to make it happen is to refuse to pay for anyone short of that.
---
True, there's nothing else like eve out there. That makes it tough. But it just got to the point recently for me that I'm more willing to play other games (you know, ones that don't cost me money every month and that also aren't bug ridden) than let CCP profit off of me.
---
If you find some in ls though let me know yeah
---
Answer to all is: it depends. :)
---
Depending on your reprocessing skills, it'll either be more profitable to sell the ore itself or reprocess to materials. Check out prices for both the volume you'd get by reprocessing versus the volume of ore required to smash into that to decide which is better.
---
If you're going to move it to sell (and generally, yes you will want to), then factor in the risk of multiple jumps. Compressing the ore in system - if that's an option - for transporting should mean you can get more moved in less runs, reducing the risk of someone noticing you moving back and forth and deciding to jump you.
---
Generally, you'll want to figure out when the neighbouring insecure systems are quiet and do a run to where it's a clear run to your trade hub then go back and get as much out during that window as possible. That way you can do the pure high sec runs when it suits rather than worrying too much about local activity. Alternatively, you might want to sell in a low sec hub if there's one nearby, which does mean looking into scouting the route and making sure no one's worked out what/when you're doing restock runs. You'll usually get a better price point in low than high, but it'll move slower, as well as the increased risk, so factor that in. If you have both a low and a high sec trade hub nearby, you may consider splitting your stock to cover both.
---
Bullshit hyping.
---
Article 4(18) exemption under the regulations; they're not a legal body engaged in economic activity (unless there's more in the background that we're unaware of with regard to this specific corporation).
---
This won't apply to the greater majority of EVE corps, don't let the GDPR boogieman scare you.
---
&gt; I also have the right to not be harassed by the laws of a country i dont live in.
---
Very arguable. That right is certainly not unlimited, as is clearly the case with GDPR.
---
A US company with servers in the US will be penalised for mishandling data from EU customers, on pain of being trade sanctioned or banned in the EU, which is obviously a massive source of income.
---
[how i see this thread going](https://imgur.com/a/t30CaKE)
---
For 1B ISK, I'll make the beat
---
I don't think you could reasonably use GDPR to get CCP to delete your ingame name. I think that the argument would be that since characters can be bought and sold, they would not directly constitute personally identifiable information (however CCP may just decide that it's easier to turn them into CaldariCitizen X than argue about it).
---
I wonder what would happen if someone that is on the monument asked to have all of their information deleted. Can they ask to be stricken from the monument as well?
---
it's a salt shaker
---
I had a great warp bug yesterday, moving my JF through high sec. Web my JF into warp, warp my hyperspacial web alt to the next gate to see my JF already sat there at zero. Look back at my JF account, still 20 AU off the gate. GGWP CCP.
---
Heres the best breakdown I can give you on this..

2. The silhouette of a corpse in eve - i.e. the guy got killed and is salty 
---
Welcome to the rest of the world, given EU citizens had to account for US laws for years when it comes to the internet or ICANN will take your domain name, i can't feel sorry for Americans complaining about it now. 
---
There are several international agreements between the US and EU regarding privacy. The main one is Privacy Shield which allows someone subject to EU laws to engage in privacy lawsuits in the US.
---
I assume you don't want to get too specific. But what do you mainly trade in? Ships, ammo, caps, drugs?
---
Jesus r/eve is full of shitbiters these days
---
The obvious EVE solution to this is to hire members of PIRAT to permacamp outside his house and blow him up in his car as soon as he leaves for work. If we‚Äôre going to be sociopaths and take it out of game we might as well go full on. 
---
I don't know much about European law, but in the US a term as broad as "legal body engaged in economic activity" is something that can be argued pretty heavily in interpretation. 
---
As a regional hub? Buy orders. Sure, to start cater to your locals be they bear, pew whatever but once that's rolling Eve isn't short of people who will do that for shit margins. If you actually want to build a market you have to make it a destination point where people can sell, buy and build. A consistent place miners can dump ore, shooty types can dump loot, JFs can dump loads and refuel/buy cynos is way more important than catering to a rando who wants to fit a Drake.
---

get a second rorq.

then you finally train a barge to mine mercoxit.

rorqs make like 2x a vni so they can multiply quickly while mostly afk

Eh, t3c whaling fleets usually have a couple of logi. It's hard to deal with super or carrier damage with local reps on t3cs but you can sustain it with logi.

Have done since 06 mate :)

Am I supposed to know who that is?
---
Not our fault you didnt fight them.
---
Or that you cant be bothered to come up with your own way of doing things.
---
Theres no law saying i dont, so yes we have those rights.
---
they can try, but it's unenforceable here against private citizens. otherwise, the EU can take Canada to the Hague and try to work that shit out on its own. as a private citizen, not operating a business they can't sanction him. they can't send a summons to appear, nor can they obtain a default judgment against him.
---
what should happen is the douchecanoe who sent this to the law firm should be permabanned for doxxing; real world consequences for ingame activity. how he got the guy's home address and sent legal documents to him is doxxing
---
That would imply breach of privacy has occurred.
---
At best, even if the full brunt of the regulations applied, the corp still had an entitlement to hold that information on the play by basis of the above permitted grounds (i.e. consent and legitimate interests).
---
Even if consent is withdrawn, that just means the corp has to delete the **personal indentifying information only.**
---
So, nuke his personal details from services. I'm not even sure IP addresses could be construed as personal information since most of them link to an ISP nowadays, rather than providing any real information about you. If the dude has a forum account, you'll want to check for any threads where he's posted personal information, or just nuke it to be safe if nothing of value is lost.
---
Isn't RvB still in charge of a lot of Pocos in HS?
---
Yes, absolutely. As a private citizen, you can't apply the laws of another country to someone who doesn't live there, do business there or even visit there.
---
get real.

he's not american so get over yourself

The trick against Asteros is that their only dps comes from drones. Once you take out the drones you're fine. Even though asteros can rep a lot eventually they run out of nanite and/or cap boosters. So basically it's a long fight but you'll come on top as long as the astero doesn't have mates with him. Ofc pure pvp astero is a lot more harder to beat than an exploration fit that has hacking modules and inertia stabs for example.

So just to be exact you recommend sitting on the inside of the entrance within the wormhole correct?
---
wat
---
Same story for me 6 years ago. Those moments when you think your heart will jump out of your chest are the best.
---
Yup, 15 is way too much. 5-6 I deem possible. ~3 seconds for 15 isn't really slow though. 
---
Freeing themselves from the shackles of spodbrain and returning to Thera where they belong.
---
&gt;legal body engaged in economic activity
---
So if I RMT but do not declare my incomes from it to the tax man, GDPR does not apply. Easy peasy.
---
&gt; you're gonna have to watch that Rorq sit on the rock like a hawk
---
lmao
---
Yup, within the wormhole, a perch 300km or so off the entrance. Then you get the added intel of knowing who you‚Äôre about to attack. I spent about a year doing this, sometimes you get baited but very rarely, a few jumps further from Jita is safer. 
---
Whether you end up in blocs or not is not the point, it's about where you start your Eve career. And starting your career in highsec is simply a more natural progression for the average newbro.
---
I would have probably taken your advice into more consideration. But judging by your post history you seem to have a knack for just being bitter and calling everything "retarded","autistic","bad" just to name a few. I understand that you feel the need to be totally negative on every post or comment, i feel for you and your evident self esteem issues. 
---
Reply with anything you like really to try and deflect what i said. But your fragile ego and self esteem issues wont dissipate with a witty response. 
---
Lmao I spit coffee out of my arse laughing at this! Anyone else?
---
Definitely worth learning to use tripwire or pathfinder, that way you can go deeper in to wormhole chains and still find a way out. It also helps you find the right types of wormholes for example C1/C2/C3 for the faction sites and not the sleeper ones where you need combat a combat ship to clear the rats. Happy hunting and if you ever appear in J121745 say hello! 
---
It is not so hard to spot. In one case the scoop will be gradual and in one case it will look instant. 
---
my question exactly
---
Null sec Politics has never really been V0LTA's thing, this is the 4th time we have taken sov successfully in this game and every time it gets old real fast. The finns bros wanted to stay with skill so they made there own corp. 
---
You will see us everywhere in eve shortly 
---
With GDPR they do - it doesn't matter where your company is from, or where the servers are located - as long as you are handling data of EU citizens, you can be legally treated by GDPR regulations.
---

---

---
Thank you. So as I'm sitting 300 kilometers off the entrance will I still have visual sight of who comes in even if a clock up right away?
---
You should get that checked out.
---
Yea you‚Äôll see them on overview for a couple of seconds. 
---
GDPR is regulating the way companies/websites are treating data of EU citizens.
---
If he is not from EU - that particular regulation is not applicable.
---
im so happy shipping is so high... else id be broke buying stuff off the store.. i will NEVER pay that much to ship ever.
---
I'm down with that
---
If this is bait, then you already know better.
---
If it's not, then no, just no.
---
I just had a semi-related question. If you have a corp with no structures, but now, you want to set up a poco. Do you really have to anchor a pos/citadel to be war eligible, to declare war to the poco owner to rip that poco down and set your own up? (of course as soon as you set up a single poco you are war eligible)
---
Where is the Precurser mining barge, with a strip miner that ramps up mining yield over time ?  
---
Well it comes down to enforcement power, as long as you never plan to come into the EU or do trade with the EU your technically gonna be fine ( unless you live in a country that will send there own citizens to a foreign country for prosecution ), so really you still subject to Canada saying yeah we will enforce this or no we will not. ( the EU is hardly unique in this )
---
One thing to consider, an astero can chase away a covert ops frig. It easily was worth the money to me to use the astero over a t2 cov ops with the extra revenue from contesting relic sites.
---
i'll gladly take that on a monday.
---
[wat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat)
---
I initially gave them the benefit of the doubt.  But since this bug (or set of bugs) has been around for a while now and I'm also starting to think incompetence is playing a role.  
---
How hard is a chat window anyway?  
---
If only it was as funny in reality as it sounds here... :)
---
I saw the title, yet went into this drinking my tea, took a few seconds but nearly coughed it up lol.
---
I can only speak for the alliance I am in, but there are definitely trade hubs, ours is very well stocked always. We can buy anything we want locally and most of our things are produced locally.  I am sure PH, TEST, Brave and others would also have good trade hubs. 
---
It is also a good way to make extra cash, just import things that are running low on stock from Jita via a hauling service, or make them yourself. Especially if its one of the bigger alliances and their trade hub isnt always fully stocked. 
---
Since there will always be a local market, you shouldn't really need buyback programs. You can also just turn your ore into doctrine battleships or cruisers and make extra profit like that. Remember you can't see the local market if you are in the region but are not in the alliance. 
---
P.S. Rorquals are usually good but not great, if you are't one of the massive 30 rorq spodbrains. However times when you get to mine out moons they become insane and can net you 200-800mil an hour each. 
---
1. Find an alliance that will defend your structures against TEST, PH, Goons and other big players.
---
2. ...
---
3. Profit
---
Cloaky T3 Cruisers have like 3-5 seconds delay (depending mostly on skills) until they can lock something.
---
If you weren't tackled by the Imicus, you might have made it out. When I engage exploration-frigates in an Astero, I always select a celestial while the drones do their thing.   
---
It's always good to assume you prey has friends. 
---
Also fine with me.  I cherrypick Mercoxit.  
---
Is it cool for players interested in taking part to join, or is this for established dudes only?
---
So... those gyrostabs... I would be tempted to say he was fitting them for hauling because he was using his dread as a poor mans, poorer mans jump freighter... but they are tech 2...
---
it's still real world consequences from ingame activity. I would like to hear CCP's opinion on this
---
Yes
---
Find one of the many wormhole corps in low class space. I'm sure some of them are willing to take newer bros, especially if you're willing to scan/explore
---
no mad but your post is just not true at all when honest. iam 4 years+ in NC. and cant remember a single fleetcomp which you mentioned above. Only the Large Shieldbooster BS but there i dont get whats wrong with it.
---
Is there an easy guide on how to set it up as looked into it, but still don‚Äôt have a clue how to start
---
Ah yes, the vibrant and universally renowned Stain trade hub...
---
Not squatting like a Slav though
---
You're a day behind the times.
---
It comes all the way from Jita!
---
Why does a reference to a comment on an already popular thread in the sub require a new post?
---
And where's the mistake?
---
Shock and horror; CCP want to investigate TOS breaches of **their** terms through a proper channel of investigation rather than via trial by spodbrain on Reddit.
---
Best protest is with(holding) your wallet
---
Ironically that Silver miner guy can input broadcast his support tickets.
---
I mean, at the rate you and yours are quitting the game due to not being at the top of the food chain, it seems like an eventuality rather than an empty boast.
---
My GF helped me recently makeover my main. Was pretty happy with thw result. The makeup looks way better than before.
---
Maybe if you're not very good at math, you could pretend that, yes
---
You know... in 2008 this would have been big news. These days I feel like losing expensive fitted Titans is standard operating procedure in null, and happens all the fucking time... 
---
The day market hub size becomes the new "winning EVE" measure is the day that I will flee EVE. "Amount of spod mined" is already a pretty shit measuring stick.
---
Where is the skillu one with all the boson and such? 
---
I guess making fun of this is a desperate way to alleviate the shitty state of things but lets be honest, the game's going down the fucking drain... there wasn't this much lag even when the alpha accounts were introduced and the online counters stayed at 35-40k every day...
---
So you don't orbit the enemy?
---
That scam that CCP perpetuated by being so shit at merchandising that some guy selling t shirts at a show would be better off in charge. But no, it was a this year only thing.
---
Lol he actually can do it ... they are outside the game  :D
---
You know you can hide the passive modules right? Great video
---
dude are you high? 
---
HordeNCPL are one coalition, basically have been for 6ish years straight at this point
---
Don't you have some lowsec gate posting to do
---
Good thing it's an entirely arbitrary and unenforceable "rule". The GDPR is a joke.
---
If only there was a lowsec gate to Stain - they could come here and mine ........
---
Bought tree fiddy.
---
Too many variables, ask a question with specific metrics.
---
Yes I'm sure the guys who are returning to Thera for lack of PvP content would be thrilled to mine in Stain.
---
Here is the thing, it isn't that I disagree; however, RMTing hurts the game no matter who gets paid for it--including CCP. What I get sick of is people who have a problem with RMT--fair--but then plex their account(s), which is essentially CCPs RMT racket. 
---
I've got one on my bookshelf. 
---
/sigh
---
That's cause you aren't into BL culture
---
Can't fix that. 
---
Eve is probably the best MMO ever made, IMO; however, UO is still around and lots of people still play it... just saying. 
---
you sure it was coffee? you never know when diarrhea strikes
---
Lol as if there's an option 
---
I didn't say it wasn't staying, either. I said as far as I am aware, nothing is permanent - we won't know what's in the final product until it's done, and it's not done yet.
---
Why do the fees need to be astronomical? A couple billion isk for a smaller group is plenty encouragement. 
---
pay the russians to cut his internet cable
---
I'm sorry, however... can you just R E A D the ingame bonuses that it has? perhaps do 60 seconds of research before asking questions like this on reddit? every single day this community reaches a new low! fist it's "video guides on using a booster" then "guides on outsmarting a bot 2009-style with notepad typing" and now it's asking how a ship works...
---
what's next? "guys, how do i dock in a station?"
---
Yeah that makes sense, the loss of my probe didn't bother me because it wasn't much of a loss at all. I was thinking about just waiting until I have some skills trained into drones before even buying one? as taking one out and losing it would be a big loss for me at the moment.
---
welcome to pandemic legion

Gates to Stain are in [**XZ-SKZ**](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Period_Basis/XZ-SKZ) and [**3GD6-8**](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Catch/3GD6-8), to name two
---
Report through the proper channels rather than posting on reddit, and it'll be actioned.
---
What if there are multiple entrances?(which is about 90% of the time) No, You scan the hole, check the connected systems for activity, then wait on the relic/data site, smash dscan. Make sure to check Zkill, if your target has kills using his imicus or whatever leave him be, its bait
---
The github page is pretty good but you need a server to run it on, and the understanding of how to run a server side program... 
---
Have two in my kitchen :D 
---
as a content creator, he probably has them up for the audience, not for himself.
---
Plenty of people? Sucks to suck I guess
---
Thanks! Yup I do know that! Only problem is when you overheat and repair a lot your passive mods will die and I won't be aware.
---
There's a Canadian corporation?
---
Or TRI. Or any of the other once powerful alliances run without sufficient leadership redundancy who collapsed due to AFK leadership.
---
Firstly, IANAL, but if the Corp sells any kind of merchandise, memberships, or does *any* sort of "for profit" work, then it's possible GDPR could apply to it. I know of several corps ingame that are incorporated in the real world, and this may also apply to them. This does not constitute legal advise, please speak to your legal council.^^^don't fuck with GDPR lads :(
---
What does Unspoken have to do with this
---
Mining drama after cherrypicking and starfleet wanting more renting money, thats a no go, all loot to big farmer.
---
Weird Elo cultists will take that D no matter what the barrier. "AFK from the game? No problem bro, totally understand bro, will not FC though bro, will allow BL Episode 3 : The Black Shitadel to sink into the mud"
---
&gt;What is the maximum administrative fine under the GDPR?
---
There are two tiers of administrative fines that can be levied as penalties for non-compliance:
---
&gt;Up to ‚Ç¨10 million, or 2% annual global turnover ‚Äì whichever is higher.
---
Up to ‚Ç¨20 million, or 4% annual global turnover ‚Äì whichever is higher.
---
The fines are based on the specific articles of the Regulation that the organisation has breached. Infringements of the organisation‚Äôs obligations, including data security breaches, will be subject to the lower level, whereas infringements of an individual‚Äôs privacy rights will be subject to the higher level.
---
&gt;When deciding whether to impose a fine and the level, the DPC must consider:
---
&gt;The nature, gravity and duration of the infringement;
---
The intentional or negligent character of the infringement;
---
Any action taken by the organisation to mitigate the damage suffered by individuals;
---
Technical and organisational measures that have been implemented by the organisation;
---
Any previous infringements by the organisation or data processor;
---
The degree of cooperation with the supervisory authority to remedy the infringement;
---
The types of personal data involved;
---
The way the supervisory authority found out about the infringement;
---
The manner in which the infringement became known to the supervisory authority, in particular whether and to what extent the organisation notified the infringement;
---
Whether, and, if so, to what extent, the controller or processor notified the infringement; and
---
Adherence to approved codes of conduct or certification schemes.
---
Dam that's very logical! But it's just for when I repair a bunch to make sure my passives don't burn out.
---
Lowsec gate. My bad.
---
Proteus Drone Synthesis Offensive Module
---

Also, reduce the Prot's sig rad by 50 to bring it back in line with the other T3s, and increase velocity by 30m/s so I don't have to creep around the grid at 1050m/s

---
Do everything she says, see what moves more or less in your area, and adjust.  For me, ammo doesn‚Äôt move as much, but I can‚Äôt keep exploration or mining gear stocked.  I‚Äôve branches into ships in those areas.  As an example, the Miasmos won‚Äôt stay in stock for more than a weekend.  Mining crystals fly.  Small rigs for exploration.  But if you‚Äôre in a more PvP area, you might see the opposite. 
---
I'm not so sure it's a "joke".  Anyone who runs a website and collects data on individuals should comply with the law.  Just because in the past things were incredibly lax, indeed nobody gave it a second thought, does not mean new protections shouldn't be implemented.  Politics is still catching up after all (it may never of course as these things are changing so fast).
---
EvE is ded when a 130 man corp is front page news.
---
Let me tell you a secret, many Volta alts are constantly in Stain running missions and mining moons.           
---
If this is shocking to you well ... i will not tell you alt names or alt corporations they use in area, but i guess you can trace some of them digging zkill in Stain as they sometimes also fly with their mains here. 
---
I literally just wrote 3 or so paragraphs explaining why.
---
all of those (some are older):  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/user/oTeraPc](https://www.youtube.com/user/oTeraPc) (mostly blops, some NYX drops, balls of steel, mostly solo)

---
then there was this guy hunting maze runnners in a curse (?). Also good shit. Still on my todo list. Cannot find the video though

all my love to

---
for having the balls to push the edge and showing people what else there is besides max tidi fights, super ratting or rorqual mining. &lt;3
---
The moral of the story is having an escape tactic planned, and yes better scouting. Keep at it you are doing great.
---
 Also take note that while wh's scanned near major trade hubs are full of targets they are also full of bait.
---
Thank you all view all replies and everything has been duly noted you guys are the best thank you. 
---
very cool!
---
Tbf I‚Äôm pretty sure it does list bonuses for both drones/mining and boosts.....its understandable how a new player could be confused. 
---
You mean like the 3 bridging Avatars they brought north or did i miss something?
---
Actually a nice idea to turn cash into isk.
---
Jita without his talos fleet, hunting wardecers T3 cruisers, is not the same anymore. 
---
Checking with my Texas lawyers now 
---
I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs going on with this post, what‚Äôs the problem?
---
Oh so you're talking about activating alpha accounts (upgrading to omega for 20‚Ç¨) and then skill them to 5mill asap, and sell them on the bazaar or start extracting?  
---
I thought extracting is only really profitable when you are an omega on that account, and by my calculations, the profit I make on one account farming SP, would go towards the omega cost anyway.  
---
So it's either very slow going (but truly passive) on low income.
---
Would you mind explaining your suggestion in a little more detail?
---
Titans used to do this in a way and CCP removes them for that reason pretty much lol
---
Thanks for the detailed explanation, to do PI though, those alts will need to be omega accounts, so is the 300-500m a month with the omega cost (~1.5bill) already deducted from that profit?
---
PI seems to be something I can do on my main account regardless, so I'm definitely going to look into this.
---
Even Jita to 16-P isn't that high. Those must be made in China, stored in Iceland, shipped to some place in eastern europe, then sent overnight by DHL. 
---
Like RL ICBMs sorta? Could be fun. Would have to balance it around citadels so you couldn‚Äôt bash from infinite ‚Äòsafety‚Äô
---
How are you paying for the premium subscription for the second account?  
---
I was kind of hoping that I can actively pay for my main subscription with money, and have some form of setup that at least pays the alts sub in ISK/profit and then some so that I can enjoy some activities that cost ISK on my main account, just to avoid having to spend even more cash on the game by doing something intelligent.
---
Lol are there even a thousand guilds with raid teams on Kronos?
---
they look inactive so they probably wanted to make a change 
---
looks like most of their members have split to other groups anyway so it‚Äôll be interesting to see if they do anything 
---
because the answer was "you cant" and you led him on a snipehunt :)
---
I'm paying for a sub, I was looking for some activity I can do on an alt (or passively in the background, PI seems to be a good option I can do on any omega account) in the meantime, like when I'm working (mining) but I found out that it doesn't really pay off.  
---
Let's say I make 100m/h (which would already be a pretty decent/good income for mining) on a single account (I have a miner toon with around 5mill SP skilled in mining).  
---
Now let's say I mine for 6h/week, this way I'd make around 2.5bill a month, this way I'd make around 1bill profit (omega cost) a month, which is pretty nice actually.  
---
I was looking for other options, I might even do PI on the same account too.
---
I just pay for them instead of sinking any isk I make into subs. But far as I know just PIcwill not pay a sub no matter how hardcore you go into it. Think the most efficient ways are ratting, mining, or trading. Of those probably trading being the least time investment. If you don‚Äôt lose your mind adjusting sell orders. I was making 2-5 bil a month with a 1bil starter easy when I did trading in jita. Just got tedious once I was managing 100+ orders and stopped after like 4 months.
---
There is nothing arbitrary or unenforceable about this. 
---
Good point, right now I'm thinking about maybe activating my second mining account as soon as I find a corp, might do PI on my main and alt, and mine on my alt when I'm working or doing something else on my computer besides Eve.
---
Idk we brawl in drake navies regularly I don‚Äôt have any complaints. It‚Äôs be cool if the Widow has a reason to use over a blackbird and the caracal navy had a use at all. Mauraders being a bit cheaper would be nice as well. Give the damavik anotherbslot in mid or low also plz I want it to be strong 
---
what if it's genuine antarctic ice and the only way to get it is $500 shipping? what then?
---
I wonder if you could grief corps by passing higg anchor stuff every two secs.
---
EOL means less than 25% of the max time left.
---
Since each type has a max time of at least 16h, "not EOL" means at least 4 hours left. But an EOL hole may live longer than 4 hours, if it started with 20 or 24 hours lifetime.
---
It should have been a sitting duck. REEEE
---
I left well before he did.  You mad there's less real people to play with or something? 
---
I think someone need to perma afk camp Detroid ... to many miners without sufficient super umbrella there }:&gt;
---
If they are not shooting back, yes
---
Is that a well researched reply? 
---
I dont think think so I think you are committing scientific misconduct. 
---
Its open to all, its a  public pvp community.
---
I mean I guess? but odd way to grief.
---
I haven't checked the link yet but gf goons. 
---
Yeah I've been in E-Uni a couple of weeks now, very much enjoying the experience.
---
Sounds like you learned the right lessons.  TBF, they were probably trying to bait the strat and you were just a bonus. 
---
Thanks for taking the time to type this out in detail! I've been using dotlan but the pathfinder tool looks good, so i'll give it a try and i'm reading up at the moment on EVEuni about customizing my overview too. I don't think i'm using dscan nearly enough, hopefully with more time playing it will just be a natural thing to do.
---
Yeah, structures are really what move this idea from "that might be annoying to counterplay" to "who would implement such madness?"  
---
If Citadels had automatic point defense that would certainly help to alleviate the issue.
---
Interesting, no longer giving ratting bounty numbers.
---
Updoot. 
---
I mean just took us 15 years to catch up to nullsec
---
Until someone ganks you in a Recon ship that doesn't show on dscan ;)
---
This one is pretty good as well https://eveonline-merchandise-store.myshopify.com/collections/eve-backpack/products/gate-camp-log-journal
---
shipping costs are ridiculously high if you order small quantities... if you have a bunch of space friends near you, set up a collective order.
---
It's been a while since i last checked, but back then 1 shirt cost the same shipping as 5 shirts... quite sure a salt shaker wont add much to that... 
---
I'm not the kind of guy who sees high shipping costs and then decides to throw even more money at the shop to reward them, so I never bought anything from the shop (got the books somewhere else)... but it would be an option. 
---

---
Want this item but don't want to pay for shipping? Get some black/whatever color you prefer sticky tape and an X-Acto knife +10-15min of precision cutting, poof you made yourself a cool looking salt shaker/mug/cup whatever. 
---
Alternatively pay for engraving, it will probably still be cheaper than shipping...
---
Imperium, TEST and FRT doing well. God damn that's a lot of production (Secret Santa gifts) in Delve for December.
---
What year will the whole 'salt' thing finally be played out? It's kinda cringe at this point.
---
does the active isk delta increase of 35T mean that accounts with 35T in their wallet started to become active?
---
Indeed, they seem to have gotten very confident after we undeployed from there last year.
---
^(Something something botting and grr)
---
a "new player" shouldn't be flying  those anyway. it's the equivalent of asking if command ships can do damage...
---
That's exactly what they were doing because I had a conversation with them afterwards. Very valuable lesson I learned LOL
---
OP is a fuckwad
---
&gt; this is all a red herring and that law firm should frankly be reported to their regulator for harassment.
---
Exactly this. It's a strong-arm tactic which, while legal, is worse than ambulance chasers. Commonly used in IP and copyright law, these "troll" firms are just looking for a quick, low-effort settlement.
---
Incorrect. The GDPR can apply in other countries, including Canada based on recent decisions. It's even mentioned in the article.
---
also if you use mobile depot to refit (might not be ideal during a figth), you definitely want passive module to show.
---
Everyone has to pay for Icelandic shipping so you can pick up stuff from the cellar without extra charges. 
---
So in 2 months total isk in the players pocket have gone +10% ? But ratting is fine right ?
---
Another month down. Here's to a fine 2019 of sucking crok and building titans!
---
**Don Trolleone again in game, apparently CCP don't give a shit on clear evidence his violations, for them more important that he pays many accounts.**
---
What's the IRL equivalent to Jita where one can smack talk and gossip about others while engaging in bald-faced scams?
---
Church?
---
HEY DON! xoxoxo
---
\-roggle
---
Do you have a link? Not saying youre wrong. Would just like to see it myself.
---
Enforcement is the key issue here. The firm in question is hoping the "data controller" will provide mountains of documents for them to review. In turn, they'll find some technicality that justifies extracting a settlement.
---
They're not interested in due process or diligence. They are leveraging the threat of applying the GDPR - knowing it's a grey area for Canadians - to extract payment. Sadly, it's legal and quite common in other areas of law (copyright and IP mostly).
---
Ratting + WH blue loot, interesting is the fact that blue loot generated 12T in ISK (minimal population), while whole nullsec ratting injected 70T (with thousands of crabs).                   
---
Also i wonder if CCP see effects of the wardecs in the new player retention/returning player count. 
---
[This would be a good start.](https://eveseat.github.io/docs/) However if you don't know what you are doing, don't do it. SeAT is fantastic though!
---
The 8800 was a flawed product and was prone to thermal failure.  There was a class action about it https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/08/09/10/1554215/lawsuit-claims-nvidia-execs-concealed-serious-flaw
---
Wait we can refit from from the module activation panel ?
---
With Russian-Xmas (or whatever the fuck it is) going on, the deplex game in EU and RUS TZ is really strong. We've managed to plex up to 30-35% each night, only to have the ruskies turn it around when they wake up and by the time I get home in the evening it's back down to &lt;10% (currently 0%). 
---
There is so much god damn content it's hard to keep up.

Since DnG isn't in FW yet (we've been living in the station as pirates) we're just using alts to run the plex timers while we defend them. If you're in local and see DnG or TMOC out, just shout out for an invite and get in on the pew. There's always ships to hand out in station/citadels and with Smile n Wave, Schnekt, Jamp, SC, UK, and a bunch of other standard chromosomal deviants near by there's no shortage of engagements. 
---
So anyone doing groceries will fall under this?
---
Just remember that that exciting moment when you're tackling your target is also when people springing a trap will seek to take advantage of your distracted state.
---
Also Id reevaluate whether you really need navy tackle mods. The only real way to avoid falling for bait is with extensive scouting that is often not possible alone. Rather than being risk averse about expensive losses, its better to use a more replaceable fit and let fewer opportunities pass by :)
---
Next years christmas list? :D Would you like some salt with that capsule lol
---
yup. as the other dude said. thats why people dont like you if youre fighting in a WR and bring rapid lights
---
they left out the bountys from rats
---
Came to the thread specifically to see if this was referenced
---
Honestly, if they ever do a show, they should work with Rooster Teeth or the like to do it in this style
---
Glad to have you guys back where you belong.
---
As the scary monster under the bed.
---
I thought that meant 35T isk was the net amount that entered the economy out of this air this month.
---
Hence those NPC bountie$
---
I am a lawyer, and I'd still tell you to take any such threat seriously and speak with a lawyer to discuss your specific case :)
---
That to one side, yes you are right, which is why I carefully caveated this point above; monetization is a grey area with licensed activities are concerned, and it's a question as to how far that license extends as well (my general advice would be all of it is walking a very thin line with CCP's EULA).
---
But it should not be the case with most firms. Also, sometimes it is a specific person within said organization that organizes that 'merchandizing' and not necessarily the organization itself; in that scenario you have a legal divide, but you are correct, it is not clear cut by any stretch.
---
Yes. Let's put every department of development to fixing bugs instead of letting them do their own work.
---
Ah, I was wondering why they said Yoiul CXX instead of CXXI, but I had not dug into it yet
---
risk and invest vs reward. u could always take the initiative and evict me. pls dont.
---
Oh lol. I actually didn't know anything about the mission was just giving him pointers about fitting
---
I don't want new shit.       
---
I want obvious and basic shit working.         
---
* Local ... do i have to say more?            
---
* Market ... i need to sell stuff somewhere, i don't rat.            
---
* De-syncs ... 15 people can generate grid desync ... reduce size of those grids.             
---
* Lags ... 3 clients running ok 4th one for some reason is having 2-3 seconds lags, randomly on the same grid.        
---
* Local/chat ... i love re opening chats every time it dies - aka few times a day.           
---
* Rubber banding  ... replays are fun ... but not in eve             
---
* Lowsec gate to Stain ... like it is time that someone finally look for it in the CCP storage room.                  
---
Nice graphs, but no data to support it. Come on man. You are better than this Stain Dude.
---
Ok time for fresh coffee, just after cleaning my screen. 
---
&gt; evict me
---
Again?
---
Ccpls can you remove penalties from warp stabs thx. I want to relive 2006
---
"it will look instant" 10/10 description. 
---
Just look at the faucets and sinks graph for a moment....
---
That shouts the current state of the game...
---
You could probably fix a lot of the current issues if you revamped how the NPC bounty system works.... 
---
You're essentially just repeating my post dude &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt;
---
dude... like, do you think or read before answering a question?
---
Both what you listed were faucets (Bounties and Commodity). He is taking about active ISK delta which is accounts coming back to the game.

Amarrian designed propulsion module that produces short lively bursts of ship propulsion by harnessing energy from ritual transition of lifeforms to the next dimension. The design uses sonorous carbon-86 pipes which echo throughout the chamber the writings of Pax Amarria before matter is fed through a nosferatu harmonized plasma ring, which produces varying degrees of net propulsion depending on lifeform purity and even the specific phrases recited during transition.
---
To be honest, if one dept adding something will break 3 other depts worth of stuff, then yeah they should calm the hell down and fix shit before they break more shit.
---
Id fit ab scram keep at range at edge of the scram. when you see it was bait burn off with the ab while aligning to an exit.
---
In the same way like your post is repeating what people are asking for few months (over a year?) now ...  
---
Maybe if we say it enough someone from CCP or Pearl Abyss finally notice that bad things are happening ... and it don't getting any better over the time. 
---
They make agreements with every around them not to cloaky camp
---
How much for the salt shaker? Is it on Etsy already?
---
Passive module are not '' offline'' when they are 100 Heat. 
---
Man there's so much fucking wrong with this I don't even know where to start. Firstly, you're both a troll and a mouth breathing retard so I'm purely wasting my time for the unfortunate souls who stumble onto this thread.
---
Now, there's more krabs in wormholes than you might expect, and these people tend to Krab a lot. Go to high class space, c6s and C5, there's bear holes everywhere. And people Krab their statics and shit.
---
And there's the matter of risk versus reward. Wormhole krabbing is risky (with the exception of mjd battleships CCP please nerf), you put a huge amount of isk on field in bling dreads and if someone rolls into you you are stuck. You're going to fucking die and there's no super umbrella to stop it.
---
And in the era where we have fucking invincible super carriers bots running sites, Rorquals that are able to mine 23/7 year round undisturbed with ZERO RISK, eve could use some more risk reward. 
---
So go back to shitposting about a fucking gate. 
---
Wormholers are like feminists, They choose that life style doesn't mean they have to 
---
OK. I have 48 hour lifetime wormholes. I've never seen 12 hour long eol. Never. I've never seen six hours. I've seen 4:15 eol. 
---
So, in multiple years, and currently with a wh that lasts 48 hours, I'm going to say no, you're wrong, and it's not 25% of life
---
I'll even be able to confirm it in two days time. I should have 12 hours of eol according to you. When it's four, then what? 
---
Those guys are a Stain on the name of Volta for doing this.
---
Corrected sorry.
---
Actually, we don't hold any stock in Iceland for the EVE Store.
---
I picked them up at EVE Vegas last year, same as members of the community who have them.
---
That's dirty.... I love it. 
---
Do you remember the last time CCP tried to change something about wormholes?
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes
---
Even that days eol is 4 hours or less. 
---
Mining is down, even with all the time during the Christmas people spent in the belts. 
---
'weaponize GDPR' and that's exactly what everyone running a forum has to be ready for. 
---
Oh, i think running to a law firm over that ist quite petty.
---
I doubt CCP goes out with an official stand on that unless they have to. No one wants to open pandoras box on that i think.
---
What where they broke a core mechanic and told us we were collateral damage? I remember. 
---
&gt; you put a huge amount of isk on field in bling dreads and if someone rolls into you you are stuck. You're going to fucking die and there's no super umbrella to stop it.
---
I know, let's balance it the NS way, let's make like a Panoramic Antagonizing NanoInjecting Curse module that a dread can activate if near a sleeper and it makes him invincible for several hours to late help arrives.
---
All the metrics, gamewide, are down. Christmas doesn't increase player activity, it decreases it. A lot.
---
Thanks :)
---
More pay to progress. sure you can get a titan (biggest ship in the game), but if you dont know what youre doing and get caught your $4k space ship is gonna blow up very fast. 
---
If you refuse  they will just go to your hoster. And all the large global players wont pick you over trouble with the EU. 
---
So now people around need to think what they desire more :         
---
* no afk camp agreement        
---
* FRT growing thanks to the mining             
---
Like letting this kind of mining will backfire soon to groups around - in form of timers and fleets at 3AM ....
---
Only if it also opens a permanent wormhole to a system of my choice with no mass limit. It won't be fair till I can summon my entire Corp at once with no prep required while I'm also invincible. 
---
That is incorrect
---
It is literally just a failure on CCPs part, they are too lazy to pick the right shipping size for it so it comes out as very expensive. 
---
You can ship cross content for less then 8 bucks.
---
First time I 100% disagree with you.  With high risk comes high reward.
---
Aye, the official crusade start is tomorrow :)
---
Glory to amarr
---
 but we'll pretend you were just being mean instead. :)
---
It wasn't for WORMHOLERS. We Just get colleteral dmg cuz of null changes. Cmon. 
---
Man that could be a module, high slot I guess, but put like some fuel to activate, we're not barbarians. Also, you know, would only be fair if WH could build their own supers and titans, but no crossing kspace connections. Only Wh to WH including that now WH instant generator. Now now need to live wspace to get the true hunting rorqual experience.
---
Fek off mexicant 
---
Something something, drifter boss.         
---
But TBH when you compare WH population to NS population and the amount of ISK generated - something is badly broken in the wormholes.           
---
People constantly say about "dangers in WH" but all people know that you just roll/crit all holes before you start to farm reducing the danger to 0 ... then use your citadel to kill all those spawned drifter bosses.          
---
You aren't checking enough StainGuy post then.
---
I have to check it in game. 
---
 Mining is considered a carebear activity. they still have some closet miners here and there.
---
Well; this is eve 
---
You're not salty or anything
---
I was very curious and just did, can confirm if you heat a passive mod to 100 it no longer works 
---
And you're an unimportant paper pusher who gets elected by bloc vote while contributing nothing. Go back to sucking goon dick for votes. 
---
True. Higgs riggd freighters while multiboxing rorqs ice mining. Drive up demand for ozone, make easy money. Not the worst idea tbh
---
A few  random thoughts to possibly start fixing PVE:
---
1. The more you rat in a system the safer it becomes, it doesn‚Äôt fix delve but it‚Äôs a start.
---
2. Eliminate PANIC from rorqs.
---
3. Increase mobile cyno inhib range, possibly make it system wide :)
---
4. Increase aggression timer. Would allow us to counter bots and krabs that just warp to citadels. Have to eliminate POSs first however 
---
5. Increase LS to NS wormholes, the small ship only holes are pointless.
---
6. Increase respawn on anoms
---
Rolling and critting holes before farming ... and killing all those drifter bosses with citadel is risky?    
---
you can be held accountable personally if you fuck shit up on your own
---

---
StainMoron lmao
---
personally i'd like to see frat get swole as fuck 
---
So rolling/crittin holes, farming **and at the end killing all the spawned drifter bosses with citadels is so risky?**
---
what ppl dont know is you put like 50-70b in a proper c6 System before you can use it. then you also need 4-6 alts minimum with proper dread / hic / rorqual / scanning etc skills. most times you do this solo. also you multibox multiple caps in a high apm crabbing session with the risk to loose your shit to someone rolling in / you fucking up / DCs. There is no one saving you. You dont get immediate bounty payout but rather have to sell the blue loot in kspace as in moving it. You can get evicted and there is no asset safety. If anyone thinks the risk + invest vs. reward is out of balance compared to current null krabbing or thinks this needs to be adressed more than null rorquals than that guy is a total retard.
---
I really miss those volta loki fleets!!!
---
Idk if sth changed in eve from the Time i was checking it. 
---
you are a retard
---
1. Make isk grinding more tedious on the low end then it is already.
---
"properly balanced"
---
you realize thats never actually happened right?  ever balance pass just creates a new meta, let that live for a while, balance pass again and new meta emerges.
---
that said i do agree that they need to fix existing stuff.  local, jita,market  (dont care about warping bug as it doesnt seem to do anything negative)
---
heck, FW, resource wars, removing spamability of cheap citadels or making them faster to kill if they low power.    they could create new content by revamping old content to be new again
---
&gt; Increase mobile cyno inhib range, possibly make it system wide :)              
---
Dumb idea is dumb idea - find my inhibitor in a 100AU deep spot.        
---
Have fun probing. 
---
You're not my supervisor! 
---
Yeah, I can verify. I took like an hour and a half on my main, and my alts each got at least thirty minutes. I'm uninterested in any MMO which lacks a proper Barbie simulator.
---
I mean sure, I'm open to that
---
Most people has been asking for the same for a long time now, nothing new, CCP doesn't seem to give a fuck about it.
---
Skill University is where you learn it though.
---
Fine with me :) 
---
Easy fix if that happened: just make it appear on overview like a cyno... 
---
This person should ignore it. He lives in North America and runs a website hosted in North America. He should tell the French lawyers who sent him the request to cross the Atlantic and make him, because GDPR requests are absolutely unenforceable in North America. 
---
The extent to which American and Canadian companies comply with them has to do with their vulnerability owed to doing business in the EU; however, there is a long history of American news outlets, for instance, completely ignoring GDPR requests (just to hit home the point GDPR requests cannot be enforced outside the EU). 
---
Having said that, I typically side with the people making such requests over business interests; however, in the case of a kicked corp member trying to grief the shit out the person who ran the corp he was kicked from--again, tell him, his French lawyers, and EU law to go fuck itself.  
---
Look it this way.       
---
Eve is constantly getting more and more unstable - so assumption that without radical action this trend will not change - is quite valid atm. 
---
you don't have to pay for shipping when you simply fly to Vegas to pick it up... gotcha
---
Low power cits are easier to kill now. In the update before the last one, they decreased hp for it across the board
---
Let's rewind a bit to explain some mechanics here since people don't know wormhole mechanics. You certainly don't.
---
Wormhole sites warp disrupt. If you run them with caps, the avengers basically infinite point you. So with the exception of mjd moon walk battleships which ARE stupid and need to be fixed, you are stuck for the entire duration, even if you kill the drifters with a citadel.
---
Now drifter citadel farming is kinda stupid and if they decided to nerf that I'd be fine with it. But even there you're vulnerable. Wormhole sites don't pay out on bounties. They pay out in blue loot, so when you're killing drifters with a structure you are vulnerable to having that loot stolen. Not the best mechanic but it's still a risk factor MAGNITUDES higher than null.
---
And as for safety, it's clear you're not a fucking wormholer. Ask anyone who actually runs high class sites. This includes the nullbears with farm holes, if they feel safe with sieged dreads in a site. Ask anyone if they feel comfortable getting up and going to the bathroom while in space, because they've got near2 to warn them if a neutral is gettjng near their system. It's absolutely unreal that anyone can claim wormholes aren't dangerous in the era we live in where smart nullsec krabs are completely invincible.
---
Not to mention, because wormhole sites are distributed across constellations, this forces people to spread out. You can't just sit in your corps home hole infinitely chaining wormhole sites.
---
But hey guys. How about a lowsec gate to Thera. 
---
They seem to be the only group in-game interested in building enough shit to bring a fight.
---
If we end up losing space to them, I wouldn't even be mad.
---
&gt; This would cover personal email addresses, yes, but it would not cover character information, etc. It may cover usernames if for some reason those are not standardized to character names.
---
&gt; 
---
2% of 0 is still 0 though!
---
I‚Äôve heard PI can net similar if not better numbers. And you can have three farms under one login. I can‚Äôt confirm because I always forget to maintain it
---
Why not, i love it - will shut down all lowsec JF movement on day one :D         
---
Remove all danger to capital engagements as guy sitting in 100AU spot will be able to lock all cyno possibility before any one can get to him in 10% TIDI.     
---
Have fun warping between cyno inhibs dropped on spots 50-100AU from each other.      
---
8$ plus 20$ shipping according to above screenshot...
---
Yes, any kind of economic activity. Even your best friend's brother who built that bench for you one time could be affected if you sent him anything by email. 
---
Ore is free if I mine it.
---
The Chori rage is strong with this one....
---
Pike Brewing is basically a normal restaurant. We generally have to be seated outside of the bar due to the number of people that show up!
---
You'd think, but welcome to the overreaching bullshit that is GDPR. Let me give you an example. If I'm a small town newspaper based in the US, and I have a website to share my news articles, I could be affected by GDPR. Even if I redirect anyone who has an EU ip address with a warning that I can serve them. If they use a VPN to circumvent my redirect and I happen to collect their information, I could be affected by GDPR. 
---
NPC bounties are an isk faucet.
---
Active isk delta is the change in "active isk." Examples: isk that is removed from the game because it was involved in RMT and the GMs take it would be a negative active isk delta; the isk in the wallet of a player who logs in after not having logged in for the last 3 years is positive active isk delta.
---
Hide yo rorqs, hide yo soups
---
bought a domain? -&gt; economic activity. the good advice is to switch to software that allows you to comply with GDPR requests and not ever get into the spiral of 'do i need a lawyer for this'.
---
Its unfixable. The problem is on Amazon's side with their AWS cloud service, and CCP has a one year contract with them so they can't back out
---
Yeah the blue donut there probably did you guys zero favors.
---
So the big thing I get from this is that while a lot of Eve seem content to whine about how broke the game is and how no one will ever beat Goons/Test, FRT didn't get that memo. 
---
The next FRT - Test war is going to be pretty amazing.
---
GOTG should be taking notes.  This is how you use a negoitated (i.e., bought) peacetime.
---
Well now that that strange AUTZ alliance that was living there has moved into their own hole, is probably time for another group to keep guard in Thera 
---
I am roughly estimating about 12 to 15 people but I will have a better idea closer to the date.
---
Hello,
---
My name is Wallymarts, and this will be one of the most natural things i have done ever in eve, i may even be too easy.
---
God bless.
---
Yet delve has some of the highest loss rate around. Besides what is the % chance of someone rolling into your wh? How long does it take to pay for your set up? What the average isk per hour in wspace?
---
yeah but they still got the long reinforcement timers that make them annoying.
---
compare to a POS where you got max of 36 hours before you can finish it off.
---
plus the damn dmg caps....so caps are relatively useless vs these spammable cheap citadels
---
If you consider doing groceries as an 'economic activity' under the defined terms, then sure.
---
I don't see how that could be relevant to this specific context though.
---
Amusingly, the ratting amounts per region chart is missing.
---
&gt; All the metrics, gamewide, are down. 
---
For once I have to support your opinion, yes all game metrics are down ... across the whole year ... not just around holidays
---
As someone else noted show them on the overview no matter what distance like ESS and make it so only one can be anchored. I know it‚Äôs a dumb thought but I have done a lot of krab hunting and mobile cyno inhibs are already easily countered.
---
ooof. That hits close to home mate, lol.
---
stainguy might be the biggest retard in goonswarm which is impressive if u think about the rest of their posters here 
---
The data subject has to be one to which the regulations apply, not the controller or processor of the data (as defined in the regulations).
---
yes.
---
(to all your questions)
---
You cram 30000 mouth breathers into one region and when idiots die that's proof that null is dangerous enough? Anyone with two braincells is invincible in delve. If you're not smart enough to be in fleet, have a cyno, and have a panic, there's STILL a good chance you get saved.
---
Isk per hour varies widely. Depends on method, skills, class, isk you put on field, and what sites you have spawn. In general wormholes have higher isk per hour than null but no ability to infini chain sites.
---
Odds of being rolled too are pretty fucking high. There's 500 something c5s IIRC, but c5s are quickly chained because the majority of 5s have a 5 static. So you find one you'll find more. Theres about 100 c6s. So multiply the odds of c5s by 5.
---
Nah, my trusty Stabber is already tanky enough with it's default 1600mm rolled cardboard compact plates.
---
nah, i have intrest in flying in gila fleets all day anymore. this isnt 2016.
---
So... is this discord going to be taking over the function of an out-of-game place to show the upcoming fleet schedule? Because that's a very useful function, but if so I don't see where it's at. The various pings channels don't seem to have that information.
---
Constant flow of new shit leads to constant flow of new people.  This happened to war thunder not so long ago and made me quit. And I was a paying player. Sure there's a lot of newcomers now, yet when core problems are left in pursue of more stuff for the sake of more stuff the overall quality of both the stuff and the players lowers significantly.
---
loosing something in delve = brainlet
---
not loosing something in delve = yes i know my right thumb is points left
---
not loosing something while wh farming = maybe it happens next week
---
loosing something while wh farming even with all safety mechanics and preperations taken care of = this is eve
---
Why? Refined minerals sell for more and are less volume than compressed ore. Just gotta have the perfect refining bonuses at a tatara/athanor and perfect refining skills.
---
Hey look it's this thread again
---

Its fine for people multiboxing PvE 90% of their game time and then throw their BigToys (that meant no real accomplishment to them because of multibox pve scalability) into some prestaged fights once or twice a year.

I assume abyssal blueloots also count right?

It has always been this way, you are wrong.

ironically, Volta is the only corp in skill urself to have lost botting vnis it looks like 
---
few jumps form jita always means getting jumped by daytripping gangs of lokis with more support waiting outside. i live in a wormhole and its always the same.
---
It doesn't even need a "revamp" in the sense that the whole system needs to be reworked. Simply bump all anom respawns up by 5 minutes maybe, decrease all nullsec bounties by maybe 15-20%, and that'd probably be pretty close to good. It'd probably result in 20 trillion fewer isk fauceting into the game per month... or if it didn't reduce the faucet by that much, it'd only be because people moved from grinding anoms to other activities like farming in WHs or running incursions, and those things could then be tweaked when there's some more data. Etc.
---
Great explanation
---
The dumbness of this comment makes my brain hurt.
---
Thanks for taking the time to write this up. Very interesting read from my perspective. 
---
go with a tech 1 explo frig to learn the ropes. because you gonna die a lot. 
---
Thanks. U learnd me a lot. 
---
I love TiS, appreciate the extra broadcast per week. 
---
Yeah, people who got titans before rorquals were objectively superior because they suffered more. This is a sane thought.
---
Brilliant 
---
do you know how much isk needs investing in delve to be what it is? fuck you entitiled worm holer
---
just cuz you are homeless....
---
you are exchanging Euro's or whatever currency for food or other items/services. This makes you part of the economic chain. 
---
In other words, unless you live like cavemen, somewhere in the woods in the middle of nowhere, you are active in the economy. 
---
I happen to have inside knowledge that CCP is going to change PI; certain materials are only going to be available in lowsec and be empire-specific as part of CCP's plan to overhaul an alliance reason to own things in lowsec (LMAO POCOS ARE NEW OLD MOONS). Why is this important? Well with the second iteration of capital re-balance (coming soon^TM), these materials will be required for titan manufacturing.
---
Source: Noobman Leaks \o/  Confirm it yourself too, check Molden Heath to see who has a POCO empire now 
---
Over heated my prop and repaired it. The mid slot over the cap showed damage, so I repaired the extenders too but this didn‚Äôt reduce the heat shown above the cap?
---
Increase damage cap when more citadels are in system? 
---
l3l 3v3 is 411 4b0ut the 0p53c. 
---
yes but are linemembers investing said isk? no
---
farmholes are solo operations...maybe to guys...usually linemembers. think of farmholes as in whlers own personal delve. only with risk.
---
Yeah, gonna have to go with everyone one else here. You're a fucking moron. You're working under the idiotic assumption that the only way for someone to get into/be in your hole is through the (not crit, who does that, that literally screams "ratting here, please don't disturb!") static. Either you're willfully ignoring the lack of local/someone rolling into your hole, making you a worthless mouthbreathing troll just trying to stir up shit, or you actually don't know how whs work, in which case simple stupidity is the explanation for your complete lack of understanding basic game mechanics.
---
We're gonna assume option 2 here, stupidity, because it let's me offer an explanation for the newbie folks that actually might want an explanation. There's generally 2 ways of farming a C5. Battleships, and Dreads. If you're in battleships, yeah, you're pretty safe. About the best way to drop on a pair of tinker rattles is to seed an instant scram stealth bomber off scan of the sites, if possible, wait on your target to start ratting, then warp a couple dudes in cloaked to scram the mjd and prsy the rats don't alpha you before the rest of your seeded fleet can get on grid and finish them off. Other than that, yeah, if a new sig spawns or you see the sabre on d or you see any probes you're noping the fuck out. Granted, its STILL more dangerous than carrier ratting because lol instant warp prealigned bullshit before the hunters screen has even loaded as they hit system. Also, keep in mind the isk/hr for the battleships is much lower than dreads, maybe 400 mil an hour before drifter citadel kills.

So let's talk about your real "concern" the majority of blue loot being generated by dread farming. Since you seem to lack basic game knowledge, I'll also assume you don't actually know how dreads work either, given stupidity is the best exolanstiin gor your post. See, dreads have this module called a "siege module" when you activate this "siege module" you can't warp anywhere, or move (unless previously moving) for 5 minutes. Literally all that needs to happen is someone to safely, or he'll just have sitting in system a couple cloaky sabres, a scanner and a fleet on standby. Sabres warp in, keep the dreads bubbled, scanner gets the chain, fleet comes in, boom dead dread(s). If the hole is crit, fine, first wave brings extra sabres, once hole rolled from incoming mass scan fresh chain.
---
Yeah, you're an idiot
---
&gt;Eliminate PANIC from rorqs.
---
I'd rather just see rorqs be the mining fleet support vessel that it seems they were originally intended to be, like the other ships in their class. PANIC makes a lot of sense when you're using it to shield a subcap mining fleet; the problem becomes where you have a ship with a virtually insatiable ore capacity which is *also* intensely multibox-friendly while *also* having mining capacity on par with a group of exhumers.
---
The other problem is that I really don't want to see changes made to Rorqual mining *before* the isk faucet situation is unfucked. Messing with one without touching the other scares me.
---
I really don't feel like that would solve anything. The game has changed to null-blocs with turbokrabs and changing that is inviting more bullshit. They just need to focus on ways for smaller alliances to stay super relevant. Find ways for nano gangs to really be painful and encourage small fleet combat instead of TiDi fights.
---
Time zone tanking means wiill be a boring war
---
Why is silver playing as a female in game 
---
eh, i'd say more increase dmg cap when in low power mode or when no modules fitted.  and reduce reinforcement timer to 36 hours
---
so throwaway citadels can be quickly dispatched.
---
keep in mind newly placed citadels have 3 days of fuel time, so anchoring citadels are unaffected
---
That would at least meet the design concept of CCP for Titans. They were designed to be a very rare accomplishment and getting one was INTENDED to hurt if you tried it alone .... 
---
\o/
---
wait, there was a post ?
---
Okay but what does any of that have to do with an EVE online corporation?  
---
Like I said, it's outside the scope of the context of this case. I'm not going to walk you through every step of GDPR on fucking reddit, go read a slideshow or pay for a LinkedIn seminar like every other punter.
---
I mean I agree with most of what you're saying - setting up a bear hole takes a lot of up-front ISK and you're doing it on your lonesome. But once you're set up, it's probably one of the safest PvE activities you can find. (disclaimer: I'm a battleship peasant, I don't rat in caps)
---
You close all the connections as we all know so the only way anything happens to you is if someone rolls into you. Not only that, but they have to be ready to engage you at a moment's notice depending on your setup and alertness. And after countless hours ratting, you and I both know that's extremely, *extremely* unlikely in a C5. A pair of Nestors pay for themselves after about two hours, and I'm pretty sure caps are not far off (more cost, more isk/h). So even in the unlikely event something manages to snag you, you probably already paid for your loss in that very ratting session. In fact, I think the only time I lost my battleships was to the rats themselves due to various fuckups on my end - this is after a year of owning a C5.
---
So let's not sit around and pretend like farming C5 sites is this exciting, risky deal where anything could happen at any point, it's safe as fuck. Sure, sieging a dread is different, but in C5s it's still reasonably safe. A C6 is a lot easier to roll into, and I can't claim to know how often that happens though. 
---
I too am retarded and can't read basic english
---
Fun fight, thank you for sharing! I suspect your opponents did not see this fit coming :)
---
It is times like these i feel bad.
---
Im sure you are a good person and all, but im a shit poster, i dont NEED facts. Simply stating things over and over makes them real.
---
That is different from heat damage. I‚Äôm not sure exactly how it works, but basically the more you overheat stuff, the more that number increases, which causes overheated items to take more damage. It slowly cools down as you wait
---
No, the risk isn't zero because you can get incoming wormholes and also get evicted with no asset safety.
---
They are currently petitioning CCP to rename the null system in Stain, which is closest to Low-Sec to "G8-2LS", and provide a regional gate their.
---
So you're saying you want a Tenebrex that doesn't require sovereignty and has an anchoring cycle that is something like 60 times faster.
---
/u/Stainguy
---
Show this good fellow your passion.
---
As a very old member of the SA forums, in a lot of games Goons' goal is to destroy the game for other players and generally just mess around, have fun and break stuff. This was the initial approach to EVE as well. Now goons have morphed into a very different entity in EVE, and Jenshae is a little disconnected from that it seems. Although, stuff like high sec ganking and the recent destruction of the north still harks back to the original goon mindset, albeit with a little more organisation.
---
There are very wide ranging exemptions for small enterprises. It really isn't as oppressive as some people say it is, but it does go a few steps beyond the existing regulations that had been in force prior to them.
---
Sure, this can be the thread for complete fucking nonsequiturs.
---
Rofl empty node
---
nah, just make them grid wide, that way you can deal with the incoming caps by bubbling them away on the cyno grid or using a drag bubble on the original grid to catch them. Making anchorable jammers system wise just creates a shit ton of problem and would turn into an exception fest. If you made the jammer system wide you'd need so many restrictions that it wouldn't be a viable tool for hunting or roaming gangs. 
---
Yesterday we talked to Hedliner from PL about the big fight that happened on Saturday. Last midweek show we showed how to run T5 Abyssal sites easily, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd8FY7BLLlb5ZzR0eVdb0Yg

---
Wouldn't that include the European ex-corp member's so-called private data? Presumably that benefits from the GDPR.
---
Yeah, it's everyone deactivating shelved accounts for the Xmas rewards most likely.

Lemme know when you finally pull the trigger virgin

Some people appreciate looking at the female form.
---
Normally I don't care for the word "retard," but in this instance, I'll allow it. 
---
Here is what I have for my spreadsheet. 
---
"Easiest way is to link the structure you want the ID for and put the structure in some chat in game. Then, right click the link, hit copy; then paste it into some out of game text area, (google sheets cell, chrome omnibar, notepad++, word etc).  Will see something like this &lt;url=showinfo:35834//60003760&gt;Jita IV - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant&lt;/url&gt; .  The larger number after the // is the ID for that structure. "
---
how about CCP pause new features for a YEAR and spend that year ENTIRELY on fixing shit, (and yea the designers can spend that year releasing new skins, those dont break things [yet] ) 
---
Remove excavator drones. Job done.
---
I've said it before, I'll say it again. Make ratting/mining anoms respawn like scannable sites/wormhole anoms and you will fix a lot of problems overnight. Infinitely runnable sites are bad for the game. If systems ran out of sites, people would have to move around in order to keep running sites. Moving makes you vulnerable. Groups would have to spread out and claim more space, as the number of ratters/miners that an individual system could sustain would be lower. More space would be used, people would spread out from deep, safe pockets into systems with more risk (and therefore fewer people running sites). 
---
Of course this will never happen. /u/ccp_falcon are you listening? Think about how glorious it would be! Imagine if 2 regions didn't sustain literally 90% of the game!
---
blaster scorp.... I never thought....
---
In a crowded PVE environment like Delve, the members carefully watch for anyone else getting an unfair advantage such as botting or input multiplexing. They point out those who attempt it and they are removed. The Imperium does not condone violations of the EVE Terms of Service.
---
Let's not add any more potential bugs until they fix the ones that are currently in the game, you mean?
---
Do you know how many cynos work in wormhole space?  Guess how many supers there are in wormholes?  
---
Overused meme
---
Sure, discount all the work and pixel cash it takes to build infrastructure and provide for the safety of your krabs. Everybody is just minting titans completely by themselves. If one can't fathom of it, it must not exist.
---
When do I get to replace silver on TIS
---
Yikes, touch a nerve? All he's saying is that it used to be harder to get supers and titans than it is now. Judging by how cheap titans and supers are in Delve, I don't really think you can argue that.
---
plz never get plastic surgery
---
just remove damage cap when in low power mode, if nerds can't be bothered to even fuel the thing why should there be any protection against removing it?
---
Here's why you're wrong:
---
1. Plenty of WH'ers roll into systems that have their statics Critted &amp; find ratters out there.  You can't exactly call your pals to come save in your Bear Hole by lighting a Cyno.
---
2. Local provides a way for NS'ers to rat relatively safe (cyno anyone)? and set alarms using Vintel or Near.  Super Safe.
---
3. WH'ers have no "dank tics" to speak of, as blue loot has to be hauled out and sold and there are no Officer spawns in WH sites (drifter sure).
---
4. WH'ers have no asset safety so, what you invest into a Bear hole can evaporate rather quickly and getting a Dread made (or hope that you get a good connection) or brought back in can be tedious.
---
Your argument is trash.
---
Fix chat and market bugs (two of the most integral parts of the game).
---
Remove citadel reinforcement timer when in low power mode so new Eden doesn't end up like a built up city with 100 citadels in each system (also will go some way to fixing fw).
---
Give cynos a spool up time or make capital ships spool up when taking a cyno. Cannot fit both cyno and panic mod on rorqs.
---
Boom game sorted. At least for a while. Citadel spam fixed, bugs fixed, fw made a bit better, more subcap activity, isk faucets reduced with less safe rorqs combined with slower reacting cap umbrella.
---
Also remove asset safety completely *puts on sunglasses*
---
And bullets points are easier to read than prose. 
---
Nah, you are interpreting it incorrectly.
---
TIL. I thought they just stay as it is until somebody blow them up. That's too bad. I thought interbus pocos one day will be gone forever. 
---
Devil's advocate: There are two of those pilots in the game. Does that make it not very rare out? 2/500,000.
---
Yes but under the regulations, the jurisdiction in which the data controller or processor is located must also be in agreeement with and have ratified GDPR.
---
Most have not - there are some data protection treaty overlaps, but nothing as far reaching as GDPR in place.
---
Yet somehow we already managed to have a pretty fun war with FRT.
---
It's substantially more dangerous that ratting in null.  When you're in Delve, there is no chance a new gate will appear while you're in your site.  You have intel networks.  And if you're not a complete moron, you're in a standing fleet with a cyno ready to go.  If you're in a Rorq, properly fit, you'll have a nice supercap/fax fleet landing on you well before your PANIC ends.  Do not compare C5/C6 ratting with Delve ratting.  It just doesn't compare and you look dumb trying. 
---
This meme is due to BDO's marketplace using an RNG bid system, where each person who tries to buy an item gets a 'lottery ticket', and after 30 seconds a person is selected who gets the opportunity to actually buy it. If 30 seconds after that, the person who 'won' doesn't actually buy it, it goes to open buy phase, where the first person to click the button gets it.

It has absolutely nothing to do with performance issues.

It's cute when a guy sporting CSM flair makes jokes about CCP fucking over an entire segment of the game's population.  It's almost as if that guy doesn't take his CSM position seriously enough to deserve the position.  How's Mittani's dick taste?
---
Da real gigga is the one willing to succ dick for 1 ISK

---
Not to mention, while the "flow of new people" strategy works for a time, if you let your core playerbase erode by not fixing fundamental problems, eventually nobody with interest in seeing your game's problems fixed will be left, and the next time something serious happens all the new players getting focused on will be "fairweather friends" and fuck off leaving you with nobody. That's how most of the MMOs I've watched *actually* die have gone about it.
---
That's not to say "ehrmehgerd eve is dying!!", but I hate to see any game head down that path, it's not healthy.
---
Hulks are 500m a pop?

Absolutely nobody is saying that.

How do you deal with a new spawning hole?  Because we absolutely rage rolled for content with max skilled/virtue fit probers and Sabres sitting on the hole ready to go.  From hole pop to Sabre landing on you was less than a minute.  But you're right, that's not risky.  Fuck off back to Stain and biomass.  
---
Man, as dumb as I am, I still manage to make arguments. What does that say about you?

What do you want, risk ? Content for people roaming ? Na mate all we need is one super carrier group swinging their dick in front of another one and that's all.
---
Seriously? What could possibly be the motivation for such a system? Why not just let the market do its thing? Does getting a lottery ticket require some kind of cash shop currency or something?
---
His only passion is huffing paint before posting, as best I can tell. 
---
Does this not include every region in new Eden? I don't see Cache.
---
They probably wanted to find the worst market system in existence.
---
I would only take the anom respawn lowering honestly. It's the one thing to implement that would have a massive impact on content, the value of NS (which is 3/4 empty right now) and inflation.
---
Um yea...thought that goes without saying, guess not for a ‚Äúbtw‚Äù.

The GDPR doesn't have to be ratified in Canada for it to be enforceable.
---
From [this article](https://www.colinbennett.ca/data-protection/is-canada-still-adequate-under-the-new-general-data-protection-regulation/), it's suggested (but not yet proven) that under the 1995 Data Protection Directive, which Canada signed in 2001, there are cross-jurisdictional enforcement provisions stemming from Canada's PIPEDA legislation and provincial equivalents.
---
The whole thing is a bit ridiculous, tbh. The ex-corp member is definitely using this as a bit of revenge. But it raises a lot of interesting legal questions for nerds like me.
---
I'm pretty sure that's what he said. He said "tried it alone." No one builds titans alone. How the fuck do you think Delve is as safe as you claim it is? It sure as hell ain't happening due to one person. It's the work of hundreds of individuals, all performing different, yet vital tasks.
---
For me, CCP needs to focus on game mechanics and UI before the game can realistically improve by a fair margin - not saying this is easy, just that‚Äôs what would propel it forward.
---
Yeah. I assume its a pun to the film "The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy"

I can't stop laughing, someone pointing to something possibly out of whack with the word "wormhole" and all you see is namecalling, ranting, and serious trolling.

it may not be a whole lot - but hey, free money is free money.

Its not really about the loss of feeling "spethial" in some way, it is the concern of taking out the meaning out of ingame accomplishments, hurting games health

Yes, but mostly to let in more small people.

Stain is huge region where new groups can raise without big blue list.           
---
Now it is a ghost town - while it is the biggest null region in New Eden.        
---
I will never use this gate for hauling - but new people will move in/out to bring some basic stuff even skill books they are missing.         
---
This will also allow to move in external capital force to Stain again from the empire side - letting people to contest sov around Stain.

Yep, it was literally the basis for WoD.  Like everything else it seems, EVE was just used as a testbed for yet another failed project with no thought on how it would affect EVE.
---
With ZERO fatigue, hahahahahaha 
---
I'd come back if they would just fix local. Or remove it all together. It's stupid that it works for some people not others. There is literally no balance to it. Is it too much to ask for a system that works the way it's supposed to?
---
The market system is literally why I stopped playing BDO.  There were other things line it was a bit too weeby for my taste, but the market was the last straw. Especially when you need thousands of some things.
---
speaking of baiting I still remember fondly when we blew up some didly wh-corps tower in C3 and that one guy for a nice amount of isk (enough to buy a new domi with T2 fit) and that the bossman was also a bit of a dick and that he had left all the noobs on their own devices and that the "bossman" had a carrier and had logged inside the field so we set up our own tower in exact same place with without forcefield on and enough fire power to nuke a titan with webifiers and all other goodies -&gt; logged off and watched the kill mails roll ... and then later on collected our tower back and F*ed off.
---
It was glorious. :D
---
Ladies, please... 
---
Nice bait and blob, congratz.
---
I'm quoting you.  You said you were dumb.  I'm not making an argument, just agreeing with you.  
---
Huh? If you want to argue that ubiquitous titans are detrimental to the health of the game, that's fine and valid, but the fact that you think that they don't represent a personal accomplishment anymore isn't really a relevant way to go about it.
---
Rote Kapelle is almost entirely PST guys. Check it out sometime.
---
First off, no, he's not saying that learn to fucking read.
---
Second, the only reason Delve is so safe is because the game allows 30k people to live in a single region, and that supers and titans are ridiculously strong even again cruisers and down. Nobody shit on Goons organization but you might now want to circlejerk your own dick that much since CCP lack of balance is doing half the work there. Remove bosons, remove PANIC, double anom respawn time and your space probably won't be as safe as you would boast again. And it's not like half of space if just completely empty ...
---
this made me chuckle like fuck, nice analogy :D

Outer Ring Excavations, or ORE, is the largest independent mining corporation around. ORE was originally a fledgling Gallentean company, but struck gold when they found extremely rich Nocxium asteroid belts in the Outer Ring region. When the Gallente Federation tried to force ORE to reveal the location of the asteroid fields the company left Gallentean space and set up base in the Outer Ring region. They used their massive wealth to buy protection for their bases and keep their operation secret. Several pirate factions have tried to muscle in on the ORE territories, but with little success.

I imagine it's a desync between the client and the AWS service such that the client thinks the session has changed but the AWS service does not (perhaps it's delaying commit or some such for server load balancing reasons).  The client loads and asks AWS if it's ready (they agree on what local is).  The AWS replies "sure".  Then when Eve queries or gets notified by AWS, guess what... it's still using the old location.

I would think an alliance infrastructure team would figure out real quick who was using an especially large amount of LO compared to others. Including doing mass equations to figure out why so much. While you cant Higgs rig a freighter (or any rigs on any freighter in general) any plates, mwd, etc on say, a bowhead, would be sure to draw attention eventually.
---
At least some alliances would crack down on these shenanigans

^ This answer is an example of someone not knowing what they are talking about. A max skill rorqual mines at a rate of 3.5 hulks and with the fit and drones costs as much as around 30-40 hulks depending on their fit.

worst case scenario, if he did decide to pursue it as the in game corporation being an actual business, he could counter with employment; he was an employee of the company, and therefore all records must be maintained for employment based auditing purposes. i dont know about the EU but here employment records must be maintained  for at least 36 months. anything posted while acting as a representative of the corporation is also property of the corporation, and subject to keeping company records for auditing purposes as well. but then you open a whole other can of worms. just depends on how far this idiot wants to go.

A massive supply increase/cost reduction on the shadow meme fighters. They'd absolutely destroy the meta but the carnage that would follow would be obscene. Watching Titans get deleted by a few supers instantly or rorqs drop full to zero from them would be better than porn.

mate it's querns, why even waste your time, he'll just go on a tangent, create some low quality strawmans and then get the spodys karma lmao
---
When I can't mine spod, at least I can mine salt!
---
Yeah that's not true at all
---
I read just fine.  You said you were dumb.  I agreed with that statement.  No need for any argument or a better one if the original works.  You made my point for me.  I agree.  We both win.  
---
Balance will never exist. Unbalance is what keeps players paying to play. Buff this and nerf this. Sudden everyone has to spend the time to moved to the buffed classes/ships and leaves the nerfed that were over-played by the playerbase. Rinse and repeat eternally. This is the MMO/MOBA Shellgame model. WoW, League, Eve, and everythign in between.
---
He actually is saying that. If you've got a better interpretation of what he said, feel free to lay it on me instead of going on barely related tangents about the thing you're passionate about.
---
Why the hell would I do that?
---
Only turbo krabs would disagree.
---
I'd love to see CCP respond to posts like this once in a while instead of all of the super positive posts.
---
Whiplash was great
---
He litterally said that building a titan on your won should fucking hurt and even as a group it should still be a pain.
---
&gt; They were designed to be a very rare accomplishment and getting one was INTENDED to hurt if you tried it alone ....
---
&gt; The first Bridging Titan of my Corp some 6 years back was a team project of a 50-irl-people corp as we had no R64 pre-Phoebe.
---
&gt; Not to mention that it took you 2-3 years to train your pilot .... Now I see 6 weeks old chars in Komodos ...
---
I mean what do you want more ?
---
This isn't even a bad idea I'd absolutely pay for ship chromas/color palette swap packs.
---
There are two - I'll take down the old one.
---
I work with this, you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs true in 999/1000 cases - so don‚Äôt talk shit 
---
I'm making strides! Thanks for noticing. Let's check my progress:
---
Goons are bad for their game not because they're goons, but because they're a highly insular group with powerful in-group preferences and a huge amount of control over the content &amp; direction of the game. Their leadership are self-important twats who refuse to admit they are playing a game, and instead of enjoying this video game we all play together, they spend their time metagaming &amp; trying to mold the game for everyone else in their image. The goon self-righteousness summed up in "grr gons" is a complete mischaracterization of the problem in an attempt to discredit anyone raising issues about the increasingly stale state of Eve by forcing every issue into a neat box. grr gons is much easier to argue against than self reflection about whether your actions are having a negative impact on the long-term future of Eve. 
---
Ah *fuck,* one step forward, two steps back. I'll get there!

The obvious fix that CCP should do is get rid of the Arena damage and Time limit.

If they did that, people would feel safer with bad internet and the historically horrible connectivity of CCP servers.

When he says "building a titan on your own," he is saying that such a practice is how things are today. It is not; it takes a village to raise a titan, even if rorqual mining is powerful right now. If he had said "titans are too easy to make," we might have something substantial to talk about, but I ain't about to let some goober pretend like building an empire ain't work. 
---
It's nice that you put this behind a link, so I don't have to be exasperated about what's behind it being of low value.
---
Still downvoting tho.

Well not once a week but it's used pretty often and I'm too lazy to look for other examples

Because then you can actually be driven by facts and not blind loyalty without a shred of self-evaluation instead of just insisting you are:
---
&gt; I don't need to appeal to emotion to do what I want.
---
I giggled IRL
---
When you try to argue with querns remember this is his baby. He has been pushing and lobbying for these changes for years. 
---
A few items to help clarify.  
---
*A rorqual requires around 2b in skill books at a spare 15m in specific skill points.  
---
*A rorqual requires a fitting plus drones and depending on how well you fit it, this will run up to 11-12b including drones and implants.  
---
*A rorqual that you want to survive for any amount of time more than the first time someone spots it will need to have access to a local standing fleet to bring aid when it gets caught while in siege mode.  
---
*A maximum skilled rorqual (closer to 20-22m specific skill points) will harvest a total of 3.5x a well fit AND rorqual boosted hulk.  
---
*A maximum skilled rorqual will use between 11k-12k heavy water per hour and depending on what you are mining will net around 100-140m in ore expected value depending on 0/+5/+10 variety and if a belt is fresh and still has ochre to chew through.  
---
*Moon mining will result in around 100-140m up t o 1b-1.5b an hour depending on what the moon has, R4s being horrible up to R64s (xeno) being worth quite a bit more.  
---
*Short of it being a newly rolled character, you can expect to inject 20-25 injectors to get to a good point on a new rorqual and 35 or so to hit t2 core, t5 cap industrial, and up all of the other skills to max it out at mining.  
---
*A rorqual running with a lot of sub-optimal skills will only be netting half of the income level even at the same price point for fit and drones and it is very likely that running only t1 core, L1-3 cap industrial and other drone skills you will see a max of 50-100m an hour.  
---
*People will very much want to come kill you. You are a big shiny fun kill mail. They will also be bipolar to a degree and hate the fact you are in a dirty rorqual and even though you provide content, you are the entire problem with all of EVE.
---
could also make it so that anoms don't give ticks but some sort of blue loot like in whs, that way the hunters actually have an incentive to kill the ratters and get the loot for themselves. As it stands there is zero incentive to hunt ratters, unless you enjoy killing vnis all day I guess.
---
And it would be boring.
---
if it's a business sure, with an economic presence in the EU. That's different from this case where it's just "this guy" who made up a site for an entirely fictional group of people in an online game.
---
there's a difference between a business and just some guy.
---
one is "sanctionable" one is "unenforceable". sure anyone can sue anyone for anything. look at the us legal system. but the GDPR system getting a 20m euro judgment against "bob from windsor, ontario, a private citizen without two dimes to rub together"  is another.
---
hahahaha reading is hard
---
All bullshit aside, I didn't even know he was a goon. Seriously?
---
Article 4 (18) defines an enterprise to be "a natural or legal person engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form, including partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity;"
---
The concept of "economic activity" in the EU is used to refer to provision of goods or services, even if it's a free service. And you'll note that the GDPR request wasn't made to an EVE corporation but to a privately hosted website running a forum used by an EVE corporation.
---
As far as GDPR is concerned, that corp website is a free service (an economic activity), run by a legal or natural person, directed at people inside the EU and which captures and stores some elements of personal data. EU users of that forum have a right to exercise the GDPR Right of Access and Right to Erasure on it.
---
What he said about the current accessibility of titans :
---
&gt; (that meant no real accomplishment to them because of multibox pve scalability)
---
Which is true
---
&gt; Now I see 6 weeks old chars in Komodos ...
---
Which is true because lol injectors and safe krabbing
---
Sooooo her can you please link his comment where he talked about building one on your own because I cannot find it.
---
Kinda stoked to see VOLTA still around. SFC is a solid dude.
---
They've lasted a lot longer than a lot of other wh groups that's for sure.
---
Keep it up dudes
---
Yeah, no one has ever acted in the "best interest" of the game at the cost of their own power. 2016 is the best non-GSF example of this. Pretending like Goons are going to drive the game into the ditch is papering over the real problem -- CCP.
---
That doesn't explain why they couldn't just revert the system and write it off as a loss.
---
Im one of the two fresh komodo pilots (Komodo Please NoticeMe). I run my own brain farm, i don't rat for income.
---
Opinions and memes aren't facts, friend. 
---
It would change the format, not the concept. You would have to rent constellations to people for the same price if your renters want to rat/mine. If they want to build/research/do anything requiring stationary structures, they can rent a single system - meaning if you want a rental empire, you better get more than one region or expect a precipitous drop in income.
---
Also, I'm not so clear that renting is good for the game *either.* It reinforces the same 23/7/365 isk-printing that is the core of so many of the game's issues right now.
---
The single biggest threat to eve IMO is a _lack_ of scarcity. Space is essentially worthless - If you can sustain the entirety of Goons mostly in Delve, and the entirety of TEST mostly in Esoteria then why the fuck do we have all this space? Stop infinitely respawning anoms and all of a sudden space matters a great deal. It's no longer about how many good pockets you have and what their truesec is - it's about how compact and easy to move around your space is. You want to keep 10,000 pilots happy? One region won't do it. You have to spread out. Spread too thin, you're gonna get your heels nipped at. 
---
But, we're pissing into the ocean. No one at CCP will notice this thread, and nothing will change. 
---
Upper management's vision is based on numbers.  They are blind to things that can't be quantified, like player goodwill, rate of old player retension, amount that players advertize their game.  This issue is conpounded by the sinple fact that the industry trend in videogames is to maximize $/player rather than number of players, player satiafaction, demographic diversity, and so on.  In short, you couldn't ever put this argument on a graph or attach a $ value to it, so they won't ever receive it.
---
you're fucking wrong.
---
You can roll better stats then officer mods. That is why some weapon mods are going for 10+bil
---
What is the logic on cyno spool up? Cynos have always been like this and never been a problem.
---
I have a weird kick about arguing with retards.
---
stop projecting :&gt;
---
"CCP, please make less money on purpose"
---
There is no money in fixing stuff, at least not short-term, put-a-fat-number-on-projections-money. In fact, you could spend hundreds of thousands and not see any significant uptick in revenue. 
---
"No real accomplishment to them" is just, like, your opinion, man. It isn't objectively true or false. When you scope the accomplishment at the personal level by including "to them," you're abandoning the social evaluation of the accomplishment, and thus excluding it from scrutiny. To use a metaphor, I might feel accomplished when I take a huge shit; the fact that you (reasonably) don't care is irrelevant.
---
"haha jokes on you I was only pretending to be retarded"
---
how would it change your playstyle in the abyss?
---
Currently my setup running Tier 4 and 5 (only did 4 tier 5 so far) i can finish the abyss with 9-7 minutes remaining. If the Timer went away i wouldnt SLOW down, i want to get in and out ASAP to get the best return of isk on my time.
---
This change would allow people that get socket closures more regularly to experience the abyss more frequently.
---
Self reflection appears to be a strong area for you. Quotation mark use, however, needs work.
---
Most people enjoy killing shit, killing small size ratting ships compared to bling rattle or carrier feels low those days because of how many you can find (but not kill because lol CCP), but it's always okish to kill VNIs, because hey at least it's not a bot. Don't need a reward.
---
VNIs aren't the issue, sure PvE need to get away from speed tanking passive regen drone boats, but that's another issue that is far less detrimental to the game. 
---
This was my mistake, missed it out of the image upload, but it's in the data download.
---
I've added it to the image upload now, so it's displaying correctly :)

Volta are good dudes, plz no disrespect.
---
Ron you are a beast! We love you Lewbowski!
---
Can never be too careful lol
---
&gt; Even if consent is withdrawn, that just means the corp has to delete the personal indentifying information only.
---
Bingo. The guy is probably scared because he's been sent a big scary 50 page legal document, but GDPR isn't actually that scary. All he needs to do is figure out what data they're holding is considered PII, write queries to delete or scramble them in the database, and send the person the output from those queries as proof.
---
And yeah not everything is personal information. Email address would be, any photos they've posted of themselves, maybe posts with details of their life if there's an off-topic forum. IP addresses matched with time logs can also be used to identify people under certain circumstances and I believe they're covered too.
---
No, but it makes it so that you can't really transfer items in a guaranteed way between specific players (direct trading is also limited, you can only consumables), which really stops RMT/cash trading (people still sell/buy actual accounts, and lately there's been some stuff with guild payouts, but it's certainly less common/rampant than other similar MMOs).
---
It also makes it so that for very rare items, which normally would be insta-purchased by bots off the market (or other players with lower ping), all players get an 'equal chance' (albeit, a very low one) to buy it.
---
You wrote three paragraphs explaining your own personal circumstances. Your circumstances aren't the same circumstances as everybody who has the potential for being war decced. 
---
There are plenty of folks who make far less than you in a week who would find the chance at 1 or 2 bill for something different to do enticing. 
---
Remember also that this was a holiday season. If next month is just as bad then it is cause to worry. Otherwise lets just relax.
---
Hey you fucking tard, you said :
---
&gt; When he says "building a titan on your own," he is saying that such a practice is how things are today
---
And you were wrong. Stop dodging arguments here. Is he devaluating the value of titans ? Yeah, but maybe he's not wrong in criticizing how much easier it is with hundreds of rorquals mining in almost absolute safety compared to how it use to be or how it is for smaller entities. And he is not wrong, not that I really care about the accomplishment of "owning a titan" if it's all to use it once every 6 months again something else than a frigate roam but hey, you all set the bar where we can reach it right ?
---
But you're just keep moving the argument for a certain reason.
---
Then theres SirMolle, the guy who lost like 5 of them, back when they were rare.
---
lol what, where
---
Rorquals
---
Cynos
---
Supers
---
Intel bots
---
That is all
---
make sure you also have show empty slots , and you will be able to easily drag drop from cargo to module activation panel . very useful during c5-c6 dread anoms etc. 
---
the show on Sunday was great and i think Elise and Ron on the show help balance it out much more which is opens up the possibilities way more.
---
In some null regions where most of the stuff is hard to come by nd is in big demand you will most likely be a solo monopoly with ridiculous margins and profits. You can either import stuff altoghether or import certain components that are missing and making it yourself. Im pretty much holding a monopoly in Missile/Projectile weapon upgrades and rigs + a huge chunk of shield/armor mods/rigs (t2). 10b net profit a month super easy with \~50 market orders
---
Oh no :(
---
Delve price Avatar 45 Bil vs. ISK per hour in a rather small 4-Rorqu-Multibox ... yes this is not an accomplishment compared to the time a titan did cost 90 Bil Hull and the ISK per hour were lower.
---
The infrastructure you built in Delve is impressive, nobody denies that. But this would not have happened if CCP did not change the game in the way they did ...
---
I think it's a great idea.
---
Pre-phobe small groups could support themselves with carrier logistics.  Stain was a lot of fun.
---
Since then, it's been a ghost town.
---
True, the reason behind it might be different. I was just more so playcating about how the outcome was similar. As if it was pearl's attempt at making our market experience just as bad.
---
&gt; Their leadership are self-important twats who refuse to admit they are playing a game, and instead of enjoying this video game we all play together, they spend their time metagaming &amp; trying to mold the game for everyone else in their image.
---
that's one way to look at it
---
another way is that we think we're playing civilization, and have been going for the cultural victory all along
---
having a metagame is one of the things that defines eve. if you don't want to meta that's fine, but being against it's use is kinda like the people who get upset at non-consensual pvp. that's what eve *is*, man.
---
your the scorp pilot? if so , nicely done bud! keep up the good work!
---
I really hope it‚Äôs true
---
I'm not even arguing that titans are too easy to make today, FYI. Never was. If anything, I'd prefer for it to be harder; right now, you can actually catch up to our titan numbers by doing what we do more effectively. By choking off the intake rate for everyone, our advantage is baked in forever and becomes truly insurmountable, instead of merely insurmountable according to the memes of those who have learned to feel completely helpless instead of actually putting in work to change things.
---
What I'm arguing is that one shouldn't discount the work of the empire that makes building those titans possible. I am allowed to criticize the candor of the argument while not explicitly agreeing or disagreeing with it if I feel it's in bad faith.
---
Sorry to take so long to get the screenshot to you, but here it is:
---
https://imgur.com/a/vl1oaGL
---
Imagine if stain has a constant wh static that went to a wh with a ls static. Stain would then have a LS gate 
---
It's hard. It depends on how many stagings your alliance as. In INIT we used to have 3 or sometimes 4, it doesn't really help having another clone and risking missing a fleet because of jump clone CD. That being said, most alliances have less, so you could work toward finding a nice NPC NS or LS sport where to roam from.
---
Also, maybe try and find a smaller corp with small projects up, like blopsing or small sized content. It's always good.
---
killing shit is not its own reward, otherwise everyone would be a hs ganker or a tama gatecamper, its having an interesting fight/hunt and actually having agency on the sucess of the fight/hunt that drives nerds to actively pvp after the first month doing it (like most activities really). Its unironically more complex to fight incursion rats than 99% of vnis and the hunt is not that much different, if you introduce a reward for doing it people would have an extra incentive and hell maybe even do it for a decent living.
---
If just killing shit was enough to sustain a pvper the wz would still be alive, ther's plenty of shit to kill in the plexes, ventures ofc but its still a kill.
---
I would prefer we get new features at the same time as fixing everything that's broken and balancing things. 
---
The fact that your opinion of the accomplishment is low is irrelevant, and doesn't actually argue the point that titans are too easy to get. It's an emotional statement. I actually agree with you, FYI -- titans are too cheap. However, saying that it isn't an accomplishment is not how you argue that. You use facts and data.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/90919062/
---
No Quafe Zero?
---
My question is what the fuck is near and vintel????
---
Completely agree. Imo overhauling the UI would revitalize the game astronomically more than any gimmicky new feature they could come up with. I know it's tall order but it needs to be done.
---
On a related note, people like to shit on the 'lazy' implementation of first person mode. It's ofc useless for actual gameplay but I'd like to invite anybody who hasn't to try and hotkey it and use it anytime you don't need tactical view (together with hide ui). For me it was quite surprising how such a simple feature can enhance immersion that much.
---
The point is that the game doesn't need much to enhance the sense that you're actually piloting a ship. It just needs creative presentation and UI. To do it in a way that's both immersive while staying at least as efficient as the current ui, is ofc a creative challenge. But I'm sure it can be done, and very much worthwhile undertaking.
---
POS was up to 41 hours in your sov, IIRC
---
shut up tard
---
If they are, I can't find them.  I thought they all got reffed (and eventually replaced) within a few hours of RvB ceasing operations.  If you know where some are, let's talk joint-venture.
---
That wasn't my personal circumstances, at all.
---
I think it's more just because of all the things to pick this is probably one of the dumbest, there are a ton of factors that he's just totally ignoring to suit his argument.
---
The thing is there was never as many caps as there is now either, so it couldn't have been a problem in the past.
---
I use the word problem but what I essentially mean is that capitals (imo, obviously) shouldn't be the biggest thing you can bring as a response while also being the most powerful. Obviously they will be the most powerful thats their role, so making them slower is a way to balance that.
---
I think a lot of pvp activity - as well as other activity, such as logistics, scouts etc, that would be required if supercap umbrellas weren't such an iron fist - is lost due to instant cyno-ing in 5 titans and superscaps being a viable counter to a 5 man cruiser gang
---
and I declare that is a terrible idea and should never happen.
---
I'll concede that it's substantially more dangerous - a rorq mining under a super umbrella has to be either AFK or terminally incompetent to lose his ship. However, that doesn't make C5 ratting dangerous. It's still 100% safe 99% of the time, as opposed to rorq mining which is 100% safe 100% of the time, in theory. 
---
Killing as a reward is fun. Many people play eve to see pixel explode. Sure a actual fight is better, but you don't get response fleet if you don't threaten anything. The vast majority of people roam and do not really case about getting isk from it, people check and see if they have destroyed as much as they lost during PvP. Because it's fun, and it is its own reward by itself.
---
We're TEST so we have plenty of stagings. It's mostly north these days though, as you might have heard. But we seem pretty good at notifying in advance, so being too far away when there's an op and not having a jump ready is the least of my problems. What I'm asking for is fun things to do solo in the meanwhile
---
Everyone in the game that doesn't have a huge cap umbrella?
---
The meta is 1 cheap fit rorq and as many subcap accounts as you can control.
---
Use my astero fit
---
Makes sense with the possibilities CCP implemented (skill trading). I was thinking of a SP farm too, but the margins diminished that much and also my hate boner for this whole mechanic kicked in ;-).
---
But this could be the passive income they took away from us with lifeblood, as our group only consists of PvE allergics, I cannot even  think of mining without getting Herpes and as a pretty old fart i am too casual to spend daily hours grinding anoms. 
---
Go to thera or camp the k-space side of one of its wh entrances. There is alot of traffic through thera. You might be a little fish in a big pond though.
---
You're basically just throwing yourself flowers man. Can't really argue against that.
---
100% agreed. Bug and performance fixes only that includes the development of the 64-bit client. Once new features are opened back up, I'd like the Q&amp;A team to specifically test server lag of each new feature. 
---
There is a difference between acting in the best interest of the game and _not_ acting against it. CCP is responding to player demands. The players asked for farms and fields; they got them. The players asked for space empires rather than space wars; they got em. Saying CCP is the problem is pretending that the players haven't asked for these changes, either directly or via their wallets.  CCP certainly makes their fair share of fuckups but we can't pin our choices on them.
---
What ever staging you have in the north, go from there and go roam. take some nano ships and you're good.
---
also, "highly insular"???
---
have you *seen* the people we recruit these days?
---
hes quite the prolific lying cuck.
---
youll see him eventually.
---
&gt; I get mad at disingenuous shitheads trying to push an agenda.
---
but this is what you do since you are in this sub ?
---
I fully agree that it may apply (one of my other comments covers in full the corps position should the regulations be applicable) but it remains an untested provision, and, in so far as the IPO is aware in the UK for example, one that they don't have ready guidance on.
---
You will note however that Right to Erasure fails at certain junctures, based upon the purpose for which the personal data is held.
---
As to the ISP; as the hosting service surely under the regulations they wouldn't be a controller of the data, but rather a processor, even if their storage services were being utilized? That has a significant effect on their obligations under the regulations.
---
Warping bug cuts out information.
---
It's pretty important to have some visual warning of approaching ships, or where exactly they are coming from. 
---
Right now it gives aggessors an edge since one has less time to react to some ship popping up on grid.
---
I had to look that one up; it's a French idiom, yeah? It doesn't really translate well to English.
---
And yeah, sure, it's a bit of a brag, but it's still the truth. When you have X+Y number of titans, making it so no one else can meaningfully approach the Y value is absolutely beneficial to our security and power, things which are extremely my shit.
---
Yyyyyyyes, as I stated in the next two sentences. I don't need to hide.
---
There's clear botting going on in most sov nullsec regions. Isk is near worthless now, but it's slowly going to become Serenity with how little it matters.
---
Ah ok that makes some sense I guess. Still a weird convoluted and inelegant way to address these problems though.
---
ah thanks !
---
I do dual nestor and always refit from the fitting windows 
---
Covert ops ships need a rework. Pg and cpu on a couple of them are so bad it‚Äôs hard to use all their module slots with decent fitting skills. And, it‚Äôs silly that an astero can simultaneously do their primary job as well as they can, instawarp (if you sacrifice a little tank), still tank better, and be pretty decent at pvp with less than half the training time ...even if it takes an extra relic site or two to pay for it.
---
Well i can give you the correct numbers of ISK/hr --&gt; hours needed to buy Titan when I am home from office, it will support all I say and make you look stoopid. Facts and data have never changed your agenda pushing since you are here ...
---
yes, yes they have.
---
At the same time, we can't pin the health of the game on players. Players will always optimize for their own benefit. The concept of sustainability or health of the game, in a fiercely competitive player vs. player game (read: more than just molasses submarine jousting) is a **liability.** This shit ain't the World Wildlife Fund. The only people who can affect change in this area is CCP.
---
That‚Äôs a fresh idea. Probably will get killed more often than get kills, but never been to thera, could be fun. I get a feeling that most of the ships there are out of my engagement profile though
---
ok
---
Did you not read where I said I agreed with you, and only take issue with the tone of your argument?
---
Its now a meme but it was once a valid request.
---
Stain is a bit odd its one of the few npc areas of nulsec not to have a non-sov nul connection. To get to stain you have to go through sov space.
---
anyone wanna rp in goldshire traps only
---
So I'll ask:
---
You're a small town newspaper based in the US.  Your offices are only in the US, your employees are only in the US, you accept only US credit cards, and your money is located only in US banks. Your website is hosted in the US, and you conduct no business outside of the US.
---
Someone in Europe claims you're subject to the GDPR.
---
So what?
---
Head to wormholes, if you find a nice c3 with a lowsec or null stat, you‚Äôll often find plenty of targets. C2‚Äôs often have even more targets, but some of them are bait ) 
---
Also, being only one static in c3s means it‚Äôs easier to keep an eye on who‚Äôs coming and going, what the other connections lead to etc. 
---
Use zkillboard to look at the data for the WH you end up in (and any connecting holes - is there an astrahaus next door that belongs to an active pvp corp, and such), and use this to get intel on whether there‚Äôs other potential gankers or baiters hanging around. 
---
When I was semi-afk for about a year, I left an astero and a DST in a WH and occasionally logged on the scan the sites / connections and then wait for targets while catching up on work, watching a podcast, or getting yelled at but the sweet woman who one day moved into my house. Made 10s of bil in loot and ransoms, never lost an astero but got my pacifier baited and killed once :) 
---
Edit: praise bob
---
Me too. What a shame it would be if making titans was harder, and our current lead on titan count became actually insurmountable instead of only according to memes?
---
Thanks. I am kind of blown away actually. Not sure if it is because he is a goon or I have played this for about two years and never knew that.
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I'm not sure what you mean when you say the concept of sustainability is a liability. Many of the changes CCP has made (following the desires of players) seem directly geared towards keeping people playing the game longer; in fact, they explicitly make PvP harder on any scale by reinforcing the ability of empires to defend their space. 
---
Saying the only entity that can change the game is CCP is wrongheaded. CCP isn't operating in a vacuum. They are responding to players. Of course players are only one of the influences on CCP's choices - but they're a pretty big one, and always have been. We wanted these changes; we got them.
---
I'm just here to say I've had an active skillqeueue on at least 1 character since 2009 almost continuously. Even when I am on a break, a few months here or there, Eve Online becomes Skill Queue Online. I have retired now to just being a soloer in highsec these last couple years after being a bad highsec miner, then serious lowsec guy and later a wormholer but this last week I finally let my queue go. Uninstalled my apps!
---
I loved the old lowsec culture when blogging was cool and solo roaming in a Frigate was a thing. I had like four accounts then. I could run static 1/10 or 2/10's in my Rifter (which btw rebalancing the Frigs was a great idea) but the roaring screams and shrill of highsec removed that static stuff. I was left with being a neutral in FW but Citadels and the T3D kinda killed the rest of being a solo lowsec guy. OH and that medium dscan proof cruiser was annoying too, but you could kinda live with it.
---
Seeing a dozen Citadels in every empire system and nobody in lowsec I just realized aftera  while there is no point in grinding if you can't blow stuff up with the profits.
---
I almost like where they are going with the instanced PVP but you sort of had that when we had static DED sites. Maybe the sites don't need to be static like in the events, you can warp right to them. Would get moire people out wandering around in their PVP fits and going to all the dead ends and odd places looking for either a fight or a consolation sweet prop mod. Citadels need to have some sort of limit placed, seeing some of these systems that had no station before and now have like a dozen safe places to jump to killed the people's game above my level. My Rifter was usually just a splatter on their supercarrier windshield anyway so don't really take my opinion on capital ships seriously.. 
---
Good luck 
---
Haha what a stupid fucking economy.  Empires paying out their ass on bounties that occur in NULL SPACE and not even taking half as much as taxes.
---
They are programs that read your intel channels and alert you when a hostile is so many jumps out. They can be set for however many jumps out and I believe warning sounds as well.
---
Try running loglite and send them it after each socket close, I get socket closed after a citadel gets rfd/explodes and ships like rorquals and bigger, ccp sees that there it fails to create a texture file and it keeps sending errors till I get socket closed but so far hasnt been able to fix it for me
---
Goon leadership doesn't have any choice in the matter. They must provide content for their members or the members will become discontented. Absolutely nobody is sure what would happen if that occurred.
---
So Goons have spent the last six months or so eating the seed corn, probably with full understanding that they are wiping out the chance of any future great war, but lacking other options.
---
Once all the seed corn is eaten, we'll see what happens then. Should be interesting to watch.
---
And thats for the 1st or 2nd?
---
Maybe in lowsec, but POCO's in highsec are essentially 100%-owned by alliance-backed corps with big-time mercenary protection.  So unless you're tied to GSF or PL or something like that, destroy-and-replace isn't an option.  Try popping a POCO owned by Omega and Friends Medialabs and see what happens.  Three guesses as to who "*and Friends*" happen to be.
---
&gt;This would cover personal email addresses, yes
---
Yeah that's about the only thing I can think of that applies as PHI and even that is kinda grey.  Plus with Eve's SSO you don't even really need email anymore.
---
I hope we get another WWB situation. I mean goons probably have more Super Caps than the rest if Eve, but they probably don't have the people to fight a multi directional war. 
---
By "sustainability," I meant solely the actions of players operating inside the established boundaries of the game, not player retention, nor players' attempts to influence CCP in a particular direction for game design. It means "choosing to pull one's punches because they think that performing a particular action in-game is going to negatively affect the game's ecosystem." No one does this and stays a viable entity; you can't expect players to do this in a full-loot, consequence-rich PVP game. Shit's on the line and weakness is to be excised.
---
Players may ask for X Y and Z, but CCP is obligated to evaluate whether or not X Y and Z are actually good ideas, or good for the game. They can't just blindly accept whatever players ask for. They have a responsibility to filter.

So if it goes without saying, why do you tell the dude to sit on the entrance?

Holy shit... TIL

He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours.  "Burn them all".

Yeha well too bad for you, this sub is turning into shit and you're in the middle of it. Not apologizes.

Also most  vets are ready to explain this to newbro, we literally have hundreds of comment on the no question is stupid threads every week so no, vets do not ridiculise new bros for mistakes they made themselves.
---
Right
---
He asked if sitting on the entrance was a good idea, I said Yes. Implied there was only one entrance in his WH to me, but if there were multiple entrances, then yes, I believe it goes without saying you scout those out and act accordingly.

&gt; I fully agree that it may apply (one of my other comments covers in full the corps position should the regulations be applicable) but it remains an untested provision, and, in so far as the IPO is aware in the UK for example, one that they don't have ready guidance on.
---
This is one of the big complaints about GDPR, that it appears to be an overly broad law and there has been insufficient advice given to certain industries to allow them to comply. But the truth is that where GDPR falls down most is enforcement. There's only been a handful of cases so far and they're all big companies worth fining, they're never seriously going to go after a small private forum for non-compliance. Loads of people in the UK have contacted the ICO to report non-compliant sites and they don't give a fuck.
---
They're far more likely to take action on a forum if it doesn't update its security and it suffers a data breach and doesn't report it immediately. Which is incidentally why I recommend that people switch from self-hosted databases to running their forums etc through third party sites. No security issues to worry about, no liability for breaches if they do happen, and you don't have to deal with GDPR bullshit since you're not even the data controller.
---
&gt; As to the ISP; as the hosting service surely under the regulations they wouldn't be a controller of the data, but rather a processor, even if their storage services were being utilized? That has a significant effect on their obligations under the regulations.
---
I was just using buying webhosting as an example of how it's futile to claim running a website isn't an "economic activity." While your point wasn't relevant to what I was saying, you are correct that a webhost counts as a data processor and it's the people collecting and storing the data (the website owners) who are data controllers and must respond to requests.
---
People use it to move goods (and themselves) around new eden. If you don't have jump freighter access then it is the next best thing imo.

That‚Äôs really good to know. Thanks!
---
If you're having trouble finding targets, consider your blue list. Not preach, it's an issue for anyone in a null block, but if solo is your vibe, might be worth looking at a smaller group. 
---
Hah, reminds me of my first Astero loss. Saw sth flash on the Dscan briefly, but thought it must be gone. (duh)
---
Sabre came in, bubbled me. And that day, I learned a lot.  
---
Just yesterday had me and a corpmate escape last second after seeing sth flash briefly on the D, and against my corpmate's doubts decided to warp us off.

Turns out I was correct, and a stealth bomber had attempted to go for us.

---
Yeah, that‚Äôs pretty much what I came to as well. But still interested in an input of someone who tried both wh and null and can compare. I don‚Äôt have that much experience yet
---
Because Eve online is an MMORPG (mostly men online roleplaying girls)
---
&gt; Also, I'm not so clear that renting is good for the game either.
---
never liked it myself, 
---
&gt; If you can sustain the entirety of Goons mostly in Delve, and the entirety of TEST mostly in Esoteria then why the fuck do we have all this space?
---
because at the time the current design was laid down, eve was still growing or at least not shrinking and lack of space was a major problem. for several years there were zero new entrants in nullsec and the map looked [http://www.verite.space/maps/influence/20141111.png](like this).
---
having more space than is fully being used is a good thing. limiting the amount of space a group can reasonably control is a good thing. both together means that nullsec should err on the side of being a bit too rich than a bit too poor. right now there's a good argument that we've overshot, but the people proposing major nerfs need to know the history to why it got this way.
---
Progod said it‚Äôs ok ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
&gt; Enforcement is the key issue here. The firm in question is hoping the "data controller" will provide mountains of documents for them to review. In turn, they'll find some technicality that justifies extracting a settlement.
---
You can't think of this like a legal case with discovery and damages and settlements. All GDPR entitles the guy to is a copy of his personal data and then for proof it's been deleted, there can be nothing incriminating against the site owner in there to leverage. And they can't use the threat of GDPR fines since the fines levied (if they even somehow get to that stage) must be proportionate and the organisation has no money or profit.
---
The law firm here is almost certainly just making its money by drafting and sending that ridiculous 50 page document on behalf of the client.
---
And the problem is that the definition of what is "worthwhile" is subjective and is necessarily going to vary by each individual and each corp.  
---
Is he though?

Awful lot of whining you do, compared to how easy it is to just keep scrolling.

I am again and again amazed by how unable bittervets are to understand the concept of "Not everybody has been here for as long as me and seen everything I have seen".  
---
So you've seen this multiple times before, simply by virtue of having been around long? Cool. Scroll on.  
---
Does that mean everyone and their mother has seen it before? Nope. Got a lot of laughs from fellow newbies when i showed them this, and I am pretty sure this reddit also has a fair share of new people that have not seen every EVE related post in existence.  
---
So just go on with your day, and hide the post if it bothers you so incredibly much. Fly safe o7
---
As far as pvp / ganks then you‚Äôll get way more in WHs simply due to no local. In my opinion, that is. I would only leave my WH (c3, null stat) into null to pvp in frigs / t3ds and lokis. But yea WHs mean more camping one WH while watching joe rogan, where as you‚Äôre roaming in null, so really up to what suits you. 
---
Hope you find what you‚Äôre looking for bud, astero is one of the best ships in the game, and hunting in one is so much fun. 
---
I miss the rolling holes monthly report.
---
Neat. How does that work in WH though?
---
So basically I'm OK just paying for my account with rl money so I can use my isk for pvp. Got it 
---
Not likely. New stuff that is broken apparently means more to the bottom line than old stuff that gets fixed.

Anyone developing systems that interact with EVE data should probably use the SSO and access data through APIs as this would make CCP the data controller for GDPR. The person hosting the system would just be a data processor and would have a lot less to worry about.

This has to be a shitpost but I'll take a nibble on your bait.  Random holes can open whilst ratting.  If you're not paying attention to your sigs you could have a gang on top of your ratting dread with the quickness.  Large groups in this game have an easier time at security whether in k-space or in w-space.  Small groups have a harder time.  Changing how much can be made will just hurt the little guy every time.  If you attempt to marginalize the larger groups money making you're going to hurt the small guy who will eventually quit playing out of frustration which means less people in  the game and less content to be had.
---
Instead of linear solutions, what you need is something exponential, more you krab, less the yield/bounties in a given system/constellation/region. So more you expand and hence more pew pew.
---
give me money and i'll ban stainguy

Or you could just fix the issue instead of making the game a care bear Pac-Man simulator

Yes 3k+ people that a major bell curve of people‚Äôs experiences and knowledge meaning to someone like me delve is fairly safe providing I‚Äôve done my homework as I would equate similar things done in wspace.

Based on that, I should infer that CCP has no way to self-detect even this most obvious example of input broadcasting in order to enforce its TOS/EULA, and is entirely reliant on player reports for such identification/notification/enforcement?

Well it was maybe hyperbolic to say they weren't a problem in the past exactly, but I just believe having a spool up for caps taking a cyno would create more content.

I think this is by far the safest option and there's no reason to not get started in it right away, unless the only thing holding it back is the backlash from angry krabs.

No I didn't factor that inti cost since I already pay for the 2 accounts that had pi toons.
---
I know many people will skillfarm on their PI accounts to create purely money making accounts with 3 chars
---
Personally I wouls just use any alts or chars who are in 1 place most of the time.
---
So was the other one.
---
&gt;Groups would have to spread out and claim more space
---
This is how you get Serenity.
---
Goons/Legacy/Panfam would just stomp some smaller entities and take over larger chunks of the map.  Which then means any "new" alliances can't find space to compete, and get killed before they can grow to the point of being able to defend some space.
---
Yes, we'd need more than one standing fleet due to jump ranges, but that's really not hard for the big groups to do - we already have to yell at people on comms to *not* jump.  Spreading out would give those people a chance to jump while still having a main fleet close enough to counter-drop an escalation thanks to the recent fatigue reduction.
---
To get conflict, you need alliance churn.  Someone has to be the little guy growing into a powerhouse (Hi FRT!) or you end up with stability and only "content" deployments.  That can't happen if the existing blocs have to consume the map.
---
Even if a way to finance such a war materialized (unlikely, given that Delve mining/ratting is now very close to 50+% of *all* null-sec mining/ratting), there isn't enough power or leadership left in any alliance not run by Goons to successfully lead or provide the troops for such a war.
---
Put another way, even if every non-Goon low- and null-sec alliance came together to attack The Imperium today, The Imperium would win, and win easily.
---
Op was multiboxing chars I believe

That's what I like best about him. He's kind of like Chevis except more talking and less time spent eating paste.

Yo ron what was that song at the end of the christmas podcast?  And congrats to test.  Not the theme song,  some sort of christmas song.

No, you're just being dense on the internet. 
---
We have proper policies and procedures, plus the correct channels for reporting stuff like this, so that it reaches the teams concerned with it.
---
Reporting it through the proper channels by filing a support ticket for instance, under the handy EULA/TOS breach category, will allow the relevant team to pull chat logs directly from TQ which validate the accusation, rather than relying on a screenshot posted on reddit and having to sift through mountains of information to locate evidence.
---
It's not rocket science, use your loaf.

Damn only took me coming to reddit to find a decent astero fit.

Maybe. Multiple front wars are hard to win. You need to stage in multiple systems have multiple FCs in each front plus logistics. If Goons overstretch in any upcoming conflict it could hurt them.

Also I'm realizing that boredom is as much of a factor as industry. Tidi and structure grinding can wear out people fast. Giving small engagement groups an advantage because of the lack of Tidi. This could open up insurgent style tactics if Goons overstretch. 
---
The main advantage goons have right now is that they created a safe space for krabbers and spodbrain. If they overstretch and that place loses its safety goons lose a key advantage. I can only speak for Horde, but we really like Goons and Test being in our space. We still make plenty of money with both alliances here and the content they bring is a lot of fun. I don't think Goons would appreciate Horde or Test in their own space as much as Horde does.

Yes, the Omega/Alpha distinction is a property of the account, not the character. So you can have an omega account or an alpha account, and all the characters on those accounts will be omega or alpha respectively. Having said that, you can't train more than one character per account at the same time, unless you buy an additional 30-day license that lets you do that (look up "multiple pilot training certificate").
---
Omega is account-wide, not character-wide, so yes if the new character is on the same account, thigh you won‚Äôt be able to have both characters training at the same time without a Multiple Character Training Certificate.
---
 **The most original Post of all time**

It's going to be Omega, but you will need MCT (multiple character training certificate) to be able to train skills for both at the same time

---
That‚Äôs funny cause I‚Äôve done that in every game ever.
---
Also make sure to check the structures to see if anyone is home. Warp to them, click on the station and you'll see a number in brackets in the station text. If it is anything other than [0], then bug out and look for quieter pastures to set up in.
---
I mean its basically gambling that nobody will roll into you while you are farming. 
---
Other point is that for dedicated farmholes you will quickly exhaust sites even when chaining them over three days. No shortage of spod.
---
I would love to see the rage of gradually depleting resources forcing people to move every few months.

Also makes logistics and "geography" more important, as now you'd need to ship that stuff into empire. More movement means more opportunities for content outside of/adjacent to null
---
&gt; The vast majority of people roam and do not really case about getting isk from it, people check and see if they have destroyed as much as they lost during PvP
---
the **vast** majority of people don't roam, and that's hardly because they are krabs(a large part may be in spite of it however). 
---
See how you yourself refer to the killing of VNIs as almost a necessary evil, because "you don't get a response fleet without threatening anything", imagine the guys who can't really take on a defense fleet or just don't want to have to go time and time again until the defense fleet isn't an unengageable capital blob. I also never really met a single small gang pvper who really cared about destoying more than losing, they were just happy to get a good fight. Being able to do it for profit just gives another vector for enjoyment if all else fails.
---
I'm not going to say you finding somethign fun is wrong in some way, but you may be underestimating the weight of interesting gameplay on it.

Your rorquals can cyno in an entire 40000 alliance to help fend off attackers. Wh dreads can't. Your rorquals also will be given to you in case you are evicted. Wh dreads wont

Hey! Is my submission valid?

https://reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ad69vi/the_shit_i_do_for_isk/edfdx2g
---
I disagree. If 2018 taught us anything it's that groups that spread too thin will lose their space. TEST and Goons are extremely powerful right now because, among other reasons, they did not spread out and claim a ton of space for renters. They live in single, defensible regions far from empire space separated from enemies by buffer regions. The groups that fell in 2018 were either relatively small (Tri, Provi, then later not Provi) or spread very thin (DRF). Panfam is a bit of an anomaly in this sense - they are spread very thin and maintain large rental empires. 
---
Goons/Legacy/Panfam already could stomp most entities in the game, but (especially in Panfam's case) only if they aren't stretched thin. If Goons suddenly had to maintain direct control over Delve, Querious, and Fountain - they probably could. But would that be enough space? If they start needing more, where do they go - Period Basis? They have to eat into TEST's buffer zone. Catch? Same problem. 
---
Legacy would have similar problems. The situation in Impass/Catch where you have lots of small groups owning relatively small chunks of space would be untenable. Impass would have to go to Brave, meaning DW and Requiem would have to go somewhere else. Catch is already a shit show and has always primarily been a PvP zone, but the many small groups splitting that space up would find themselves unable to reliably rat without more strongly trying to control their space. The southeast and east are already quiet, and mostly unoccupied. The groups living there (except for Frt) can't really hold them and are maintained by their alliances. 
---
My point is that this would be a major point of conflict for the game's larger, more stationary alliances. The Northern alliances and the Southern alliances are both extremely crowded together, with the only space remaining largely unused being the far easy (Look at Etherium Reach for god's sake...Kn33l still holds systems and they've been dead for months). Forcing alliances to spread out (and be more vulnerable) or cut back on their production will necessarily lead to conflict. If an alliance starts stomping smaller groups for their space, they leave their more valuable central regions vulnerable. 
---
no bet no care
---
not completely useless, but hugely nerfed

we use one for home defense with a guy who cant fly most our doctrines, with low grade centurion pod (theyre really cheap because nobody uses them) you can have optimals exceeding 100 km easily even with mid level skills and then you just jam logi, if you start getting focused you can just mjd out
---
&gt;I mean its basically gambling that nobody will roll into you while you are farming.
---
From my experience, this is a very good bet
---
&gt;Other point is that for dedicated farmholes you will quickly exhaust sites even when chaining them over three days. No shortage of spod.
---
This is true, and site spawns present a very hard cap on your isk per week, so to speak, which is why they don't work for people who have the time to farm every day, but are perfect for someone like me who is happy just making money every week or two. But I fail to see how any of this pertains to the risk of owning a bear hole. 
---
I, too, would like to see more resource scarcity in nullsec. 
---
Except my rorquals get dropped on significantly more often than wh dreads will. Also yes when 100 SBs hit you that cyno is super fucking helpful. I bet most WH ratting dreads make back several times their value before coming even close to getting killed. Face it WHs are way too safe.
---
That's a fact, not an opinion 
---
You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs NOT rocket science. It‚Äôs frankly shocking that whatever triggers your security team has in place to detect input broadcasting are so ineffective as to miss such a blatant example of it as this, that you require reporting under the ‚Äúhandy EULA/TOS breach category‚Äù in order for it to even be noticed and investigated. Thus my point and implied question: if your crack team cant detect this, what CAN you detect?
---
Perhaps I‚Äôm not the one here not using my loaf...
---
Things aren't any different right now. If you aren't allied with one of the big guys you become "content" for them. Meanwhile the big guys are immune to the little guys, because a supercap umbrella from 1 or 2 staging systems can cover all the space for 10,000+ alts to krab in.

Getting sick of people like you resisting literally any change because it's gonna "hurt the little guy". Stop talking shit.

I remember a certain CSM member was appealing to how CCP did not intend people to live in wormholes to justify a bad CCP decision.

this thread in a nutshell
---
I played on the other side of that bullshit. Cynos were the thing that made that stuff viable and possible, because titans/caps couldnt take gates and there was no fatigue, and no one ever complained about cynos being the problem is my point.
---
Better make it a faction Sansha ship so people can use them. 
---
Thats a horseshit copout. 
---
I don't think mining value scales linearly with power though.  Up to a certain point, it definitely does, but I feel like after a point, you are getting diminishing returns; people are mining up shit like second and third Titans that would never see the grid in a big fight.  I think that's where Test is.
---
Also, there is a bit of ramp up going on.  When dudes get their first rorq, the first thing the save for is either a second rorq, or some sort of super cap.  Then, if they bought a super, the add more Rorqs, or if they bought another rorq, they get a super.  I feel like this is where FRT is.
---
Eventually you hit saturation, and I think that's where Goons are.
---
Aye it's a good chance of safety (except maybe Fri/Sat EU-US) but at the same time when you are the 1% that's your farm fleet wiped.
---
I mean the only real risks are getting caught (yeah 1%) or some nerds come and decide to evict you. Not exactly difficult to do to a farmhole, then again I guess you should be able to log off most assets in your farm caps.
---
It took me 6 months to get a titan (after several years existence to even contemplate beginning the journey to a titan), in your eyes this mean its simple and easy to earn a titan, right?

With the current system, botting is a 0 risk, high reward system. If I bot I can leave my bot running all day and go to work. When I come home even if someone managed to trick my bot and kill it I've still made money because whatever bounties I acquired before I got ganked are deposited directly into my wallet.
---
By changing the bounty system to something similar to WH blue loot you add in a profitable opportunity for bot hunters. Instead of just feeling accomplished for ridding New Eden of the botting menace, you could get paid out too if you're lucky and the bot hasn't emptied their cargo recently. 
---
You're going to get all sorts of sperg about how bots will just add a line of code that drops the loot off at station every so often....
---
Yes, but this opens up more opportunities to gank the bot as well as some loot for gankers if they catch them at the right time. As well as requiring bots to perform extra steps, every extra step a bot has to do is more chance to catch them slipping. If you change direct deposit bounties to blue loot now a bot has to drop MTUs(opportunity), they have to empty their cargo regularly (opportunity) they have to transport the blue loot to market(opportunity) 
---
Then you have the people that sperg about punishing the real players just to make bots lives harder but you could compensate for that and the effort required to bring the blue loot to market by making the overall payout slightly higher than the current bounty system, thus compensating for the extra work required.
---
Sounds like you need to get into trading and manufacturing. It could be something you do once every 30 days or once every day. I prefer to update my orders while having a cup of coffee and a sandwich before I go to work. My manufacturing jobs vary from 12 hour runs twice a day to 7 day runs every friday or saturday. I extracted some of my rorqual pilot and left it a fax pilot. And don't rat. 
---
The reason I can do this is because goons are filthy krabbing blobbers who put structures up for members to make money in, and goons even put modules in place in these structures and name them uniformly so I know at a glance what to produce where, with a uniform tax structure to boot. All under one alliance ticker so I can easily see all the structure available to me in the structure browser. its amazing what empire builders can do. 
---
No one has mentioned the fact that a problem, if not 'the' problem, is printing ISK out of thin air, e.g. the Federal Reserve.  Among other ways, this happens by the bounty system.  Rats pop into existence out of thin air, and killing them creates bounties out of thin air.  Whenever you have money being printed out of thin air, whether in real life, or in a game, you will always have problems.
---
there's this thing called local for free intel on wheter you'll get killed or not, no cynos in hs even so just go try it and gtfo if you feel threatened I guess?
---
It still takes a lot of time to get 4 rorqual pilots and rorquals and then earn the isk for the titan and the titan pilot. You can't say "Oh, this car company is making one car every 30 seconds, that means having a car is as unimpressive as owning a piece of paper it takes 30 seconds to print". 
---
The active isk delta isn't even that high, it has been over 40T before IIRC.
---
I actually don‚Äôt find that many blues outside of our borders. And having seen how well our intel works sometimes, I feel that I would need way more experience to be comfortable roaming catch or eso anyway, even if they weren‚Äôt blue

How much SP can u typically get after one month of Omega training? Also what's a good consistent semi afk way of earning isk? I have tried a vni with 4 ddas and 5 faction wasps but unfortunately due to me only have 3 mil SP I only get 10 mil per tick. Right now I have 2 skill injectors ready for a new source of income. I'm thinking of doing industry as a way of passively make isk. Any tips?

The reason hunters don't hunt VNI's is because it's fucking hard. You have to hope the dude is 1) not a bot 2) not using near 3) generally afk or just bad.  I still hunt and kill VNI's, on average I can D-scan one down in 45 seconds to a minute and 15 seconds and even that is too long to catch 90% of VNI's. 
---
Edit: near should be an exploit. If you use it, fuck you, you worthless crab go back to high sec. 
---
Let's be honest - the only way CCP will set a focus on fixing bugs etc is if player numbers start dropping explicitly due to that. It's a company so ultimately it exists to make profit, and profit being impacted will cause a reaction. 
---
That said I'm convinced any reaction to player numbers dropping due to bugs, even if explicitly stated for that reason, will just lead to CCP going down the Blizzard, EA and Activision route of milking the remaining players for every penny they can with flashy new novelties rather than fixing bugs and keeping more players

"Must be able to own and anchor our own structures &amp; POCO's, and as we generally suck at PvP, would like not to have to participate in PvP fleets if at all possible."

you are basically looking to be a renter.   I know you don't to rent, but if you aren't going to pvp, very few alliances will take you and give you space.  
---
One of my first pvp experiences was stalking a mining barge in a wh with a bomber, when another bomber decloaks and attacks it. I think bonus I'll just kill the bomber then the barge and brag to all my friends. I decloak point the bomber and a proteus decloaks and kills us all.  I laughed and wondered just how many people were watching. I still don't know why none of us warped off, we were probably all to noobie to think about it.

Delve is the most populated region in the game, is heavily industrialized, and densely populated. People whine for bounty pay out nerfs because they either want goons to not make as much money krabbing or they dont want to put in the effort of securing the space that they own to the extent that goons have

I am not part of corp compliance in gsf but last I heard you do not meet the minimum 200 member requirement to join as a member corp so your only option in gsf proper would be to fold your members into an existing member corp and reguardless they would be required to go on fleets

Can someone explain like I‚Äôm 5  the significance of moving to a 64-but client, what it is, and how I might be affected as a player?

Used to be hard? Here's some of the popular ways people used to earn titans: 
---
* Embezzling money from their corp or alliance income (taxes and moongoo). 
---
* Importing stuff from jita and simply jacking up the price to whatever profit margin you wanted because no one else had JFs and cash on hand to import (note you demanded that you only import their stuff with no collateral so it was a HUGE risk to them if you got ganked, so few imported). 
---
* Exporting the moongoo for your alliance, charging a fat fee because no one really wants to run JFs and refuel POSes and whatnot (or you volunteer for free and just skim your fee). 
---
* Running alliance "buyback" programs where you "kindly" buy all the stuff people gather in loot, salvage, ore and whatever, for less than jita prices. What you did with it afterwards almost didn't matter because tons of different ways made money. 
---
* Borrowing money from someone you then claim was a spy or traitor that you then kick out and don't have to pay back. 
---
* Using the fact that you're a leader of a corp/alliance to threaten other corps/alliances to pay you in order for you to leave them alone. 
---
* Inventing elaborate drama that stirs up your members into fighting with all their vigor to defeat your enemy (who you picked based on how many R64s they had). 
---
* Selling your members imported stuff at jita plus profit margin price, but only SRP-ing at jita value (and of course, the SRP is based off member taxes anyway, and you the leader(s) don't rat so who cares about that!). 
---
* Beating everyone to the first belt spawn of the day after DT, because officer hunting stuff. Sucked to be in a timezone where you can't be there at DT. 
---
* Get money from other alliances to have your members spend their days grinding structures (instead of isk) to take moons for that other alliance. 
---
After you made a titan with these methods it weren't nearly as special as it was for the members who imagined ratting or mining to get a titan. 
---
I was not trying to be harsh, but just stating that your requirements are basically those of a renter.  If you dropped the "must be able to own and anchor" aspect you might be able to join one of the larger alliances that doesn't require as much pvp.  But i doubt you will find a decent alliance that essentially lets you own space without paying anything for it (either in rent or pvp).

I understand where you're coming from.  Is there really no currency or value at all in adding friendly traffic and support infrastructure to an underpopulated/underserviced region?  If we were to bring a market, production capacity, and JF service to an area, that isn't value in and of itself?  I'm not being sarcastic, I genuinely thought it would help our case.
---
There's some truth to what you say, but there are elements to this that you're not considering, too.
---
First, the geography is very different. Goons aren't in the north which is nearly completely indefensible. They're in the southwest, which is *very* defensible and doesn't have very many good access points, the biggest of which (Fountain) is held by a strong buffer state. In WWB, Goon attackers were able to hit on many different vectors, including from within their own lines thanks to the Co2 defection. In a theoretical future war, there would only be (at most) two.
---
Second (and this is really two points but they're strongly tied), Goons's supply lines would be *much* shorter than they were in WWB (where their cap fleet had to cover three regions simultaneously), and the number of hard points they have in their space is vastly higher than it was in WWB. I've lost count of how many keepstars there are in Delve now. Virtually every system in Delve is militarized today.
---
Third, there's a massive logistics problem, and it comes in two flavors. For WWB, not only did the attackers enjoy hard points to stage in relatively close to Goon borders (the low-sec forces, for instance, by and large staged out of Mercenary Coalition assets), but there were lots of medium-big alliances that could help with material and super-cap logistics: jump freighter runs, stocked markets, replacement ships, and POSes for supercaps to stage safely. None of this would exist for a theoretical follow-on war. A beachhead would have to established in Delve NPC space, and that beachhead would have to be established in the teeth of an incredibly strong Goon defense.
---
Fourth, a lot of the alliances and groups that spearheaded major attacks and solved a lot of the logistical problems for smaller groups in WWB are either dead (example: Mercenary Coalition) or have literally switched sides and would be fighting with Goons in a follow-on war (example: Snuff Box).
---
Fifth, the heaviest hitters that would have to take the brunt of losses in the war (NCdot, PL) do not have the financial resources for a major conflict and most likely never will again. In addition, say what you want about the "casino war" aspect, but a lot of the medium-big alliances relied on that cash to offset losses.
---
Sixth, there was a lot of internal rot behind Imperium lines during WWB that their attackers were able to take advantage of. It's not impossible that such a situation could come up again (particularly as more and more of the Goon "middle management" realize their situation vis a vis lack of targets is not sustainable), but there's certainly no evidence that such problems exist yet today.

Seventh, WWB itself was launched thanks to a number of failures on the part of Imperium diplomacy that either could have been resolved peacefully (the Viceroy program, the IWI theft) or would have at least burned themselves out if given a chance (the Kickstarter). These diplomatic failures went a long way toward motivating a lot of different groups that *never* would have worked together to do so. [This article](https://www.pcgamer.com/how-a-failed-kickstarter-sparked-eve-onlines-second-largest-battle-ever/) does a great job of summing up a lot of the mechanics of these failures. Wars in EVE have to have this kind of motivation to work. My gut feel is that there's far too much apathy about the Imperium's position for a war against them to get started.
---
It's not impossible that some of these problems could be solved in the future. It's just a *really* heavy lift.

I think this is the dude you mean :)
---
TL;DR: Less crashes during big fights, possibly better performance overall.   
---
32-bit architecture can only use \~4 gigabytes of your computers RAM. Big fights in EVE often need more to do all the stuff, and the client will crash if it tries to render too many things at once. 64-bit software can use much, much more RAM, and won't have this particular issue.   
---
That said, switching to 64-bit is a big technical challenge, and we'll probably get a bunch of bugs for the first few iterations.

Falcons like i got better shit to do than this today...

its about 1m sp and some change per month without any implants. 10m ticks is about right for someone with your sp and honestly in a vni it wont get to much better than that with higher sp. you can make decent passive isk through pi or pp as its now called i guess. you could also do ns or wh gas huffing which can be pretty semi afk once you kinda of understand what to look out for. and finally there is ns and wh exploration which isint exactly an afk activity but i always liked it cause with a cloak you can go afk pretty much anytime and anywhere you need to.

Thanks matterall!!  You guys are great and I thank you for hosting the podcast.  Great job.

The way I understand it, the GDPR protects the data of EU citizens wherever the data is stored regardless of jurisdiction. Meaning it has potentially a global impact.
---
The 1995 Directive gives Canada and the EU the ability to enforce privacy and data regulations in each other's jurisdictions provided certain "adequacy" measures are put in place and maintained. PIPEDA is the law which applies to Canadians, but its very existence means that using the 1995 Directive an EU citizen can theoretically enforce EU law (the GDPR) against a Canadian citizen. At least that's how I understand the situation...
---
Yes, in a way, but most alliances already have this setup.  What they want is more pvp capable and willing pilots.  More industry is always wanted, but I don't think it is enough draw to give you what you are looking for.  Goons has been mentioned several times and they always appreciate more production.  But you will be a little fish in a huge huge huge ocean.  I'm also not sure if they will let you drop structures and pocos.  
---
As another example, part of the problem is that plenty of people can fly rorqs, but you need the super umbrella to use them.  If you are providing the rorq pilots but not the pvp support to back them up, you aren't really adding much.  For someone like goons, they already have the umbrella so they might be more than willing to take you on.

Honestly, every time I see one of the ‚Äòfirst node‚Äô posts, I get a warm fuzzy nostalgic feeling in my belly remembering my 3 weeks old magnate explo days. I wasn‚Äôt on r/Eve back then but if I had been, I would have made the same post.

It's always the last 4 hours, same as "on the verge of collapse" is always 10% or less total mass remaining, regardless on how much it started with.

Sov Nul or NPC Nul? Those are two different kettle's of fish to consider.

Are we talking about Init or Evictus or something?

Is Avaren Dias still around and FC'ing for PH? I always watched his coverage of battles and quite miss his streaming. He's a really good guy, and always tried to be balanced in his reporting. Think he would be a good fit for TiS.

Thing is there are loads of ways to stay within the EULA while inputting quickly. Whilst Verisimidude found out binding more than one action to the mousewheel is against EULA think about how quickly you can type 2 keys for a focus window and input when you use 2 fingers but have one slightly lower than the other.
---
I counted 120 character in 10 seconds on my trial run, so that could be inputting lock on 60 toons within that same time frame.
---
Another way I want to experiment with is setting your max fps to 0 (Or doing a framelock)
---
Since EVE can only processes inputs within a frame if you freeze all your clients input lock across them then unfreeze you can make all your gank alts lock at once
---
You had to take the full time to do the inputs just they were interpreted at the same time.
---
This game isn't for fun...

Guess that's why you gave up on girls and a life outside your mom's basement?

See my point exactly Yuri - We are never in comms and when we are we are shit talking our own members.  But I do have comms and they will be uploaded soon. So no worries.  
---
Someone (prob Alliance holding Corp) will already own the POCOs
---
As the querious fight club is almost dead (imo) and the market horrible in querious, you can probably apply to one alliance in the querious fight club (alliance in querious except goon and init)

Maybe you shouldn't have destroyed 90min of perfecting the characters face

I completely agree with you, which is why I pay the subs for both of my accounts. I'm a filthy poor in game, but I'm not stupid enough to pay money for plex to sell for ISK.

Your terrabad english made me think they'd modded stainguy. For one, brief shining moment, i'd thought that the gates of hell had been flung open and the rivers would run red with the blood of the innocent, the weak would perish and the strong would be laid low. 
---
But then i checked the modlist and all was good.
---
We aren't blue. It was a complete coincidence that the Goons showed up at that location.

Goons are a special type of retarded.
---
for one person/rolling you are right. but its not one person/corp rolling it is all c5 wh rolled while you are ratting.
---
If you can afford it. Not going the pub for an hour is going to save you grinding for hours on end. Then you can go blow shit up instead of exploration

I actually find StainGuy entertaining.

turns out the rest of eve is just space-poor people who happens to have some space money, because they can't seem to get richer than they are.

I definitely think there is a point where Test will experience a large degree of diminishing returns in the value of ore mined to supercap ownership. But I don't think we're there yet, there are many people still working their way up to titans from supercarriers and caps. Plus titans are probably the easiest cap to multibox in tidi. Their are many people across eve who multibox more than 3 titans. I actually multibox 2 titans and two fax and it's very low effort, and that's with a pretty average gaming rig other than my ram.
---
On top of that Brave, Evictus , Warped and others are all just beginning to really build supercaps at a competitive rate. There was a br a couple days ago where the Impass standing fleet fielded 29 supercaps just to dunk some small Goon fleets a couple times which actually kind of impressive from them. So even if Test is close to topping out, our coalition definitely isn't. 
---
&gt;  people are mining up shit like second and third Titans that would never see the grid in a big fight
---
You better believe those motherfuckers are gonna see the grid
---
I doubt an established alliance is going to just let you park permanently on their couch and not participate in any mainline fleets. To help them what they can offer you for free.
---
Your excuse to not want to pvp because you suck at it doesn‚Äôt fly either.
---
They‚Äôre not called F1 monkeys for no reason. You anchor and shoot what you‚Äôre told to shoot at. Not trying to be rude FYI.
---
My bet is you won‚Äôt be allowed to Own pocos but can own and anchor your own citadels with permission that doesn‚Äôt impede  said alliance Alliance.
---
I can see your argument being that you can offer a bunch of amenities of trade and and services but again. Established alliances have that nailed down already.
---
Either have a good vouch, participate in fleets, or rent.
---
Cheers and good luck!

Hey buddy, appreciate the kind words.  I haven't played Eve in quite some time, because I got a full-time job and I'm going to school in my off time.  Sadly the only games I've played in months have been mobile games while taking a shit.  If be glad to take a break to hop on a show if it calls for some PH historical perspective, but I'm not super current on PH right now.
---
Haha and you mine. 
---
Also let me tell you a secret...I'm not in Anime Masters.... ü§£
---
....is .... is it because there isn't a lowsec gate to get there from?
---
It's all good man. You brought back some good memories to be fair. Thinking of Grath yelling at someone and Jeff Raider laughing, just warms my heart, lol.  The circle of Eve always turns in crazy directions. At the time of UALX we were 50/50 going to be evicted. The day before it was all gloom in the comms channels. Not even kidding. People were talking about moving to low sec. Some had already started asset safety-ing stuff. We won that war and now we are a force to be reckoned with. It's a new year though, who knows what will happen.
---
It seems like you‚Äôre describing the Open Comms show...
---
it might just be that your 12/30 show is the most recent uploaded.  I thought maybe something changed when you left INN
---
I like that.  So if I warp into a system with a bunch of boots, they all warp off, but you can still steal their shit.
---
Won't stop boots from bottom, but at that point you can start farming someone's bots...
---
Encouraging small fleet combat is like trying to encourage young men to get a bicycle instead of an SUV, its never gonna succeed. 
---
Even WHs. 
---
As someone who has been in several regions of Null and dropped structures and stocked markets/doctrines I can tell you that you aren't going to find what you are asking for in most regions in Null. The only people who would have u join where you wouldn't have to PVP, rent or contribute directly would be those that couldn't protect you. So anything you drop will most likely die in under a year.
---
If you want to just produce goods and make $$$ without the hassle of defense and pvp participation then renting is your best option. You are either going to pay for space in isk or in pvp activity. 
---
If I were you I'd try and determine where you are flexible as it will open more opportunities to you.

Malcanis' Law is fully in action here. They thought it was a good idea and a way to revitalize lowsec without reverting back to AFK moon mining. Instead its gonna make the gap larger :D
---
And lowsec will still be dead. Shadow Cartel wont undock to save their POCO empire.
---
Because industrializing to that degree means sculpting your entire gameplay style as an alliance around it.  You can't deploy away from it because your ratters and miners will get farmed.  You can't allow fleets to come into your space to bring you content because it disrupts the ratting and mining.  You can't pick up and move because content in an area has dried up.  You're anchored to your industry.
---
That's simply not a fun way to play the game for many of us who are outside the TEST/Imperium coalition.  It carries penalties from a strategic perspective due to the way CCP has buffed the empire-building playstyle over the last few years, but we're not willing to sacrifice playing how we enjoy for the sake of space pixel strategic power.
---
Just stay in rsnge for your point/webs

Shhhh, dont take away my leverage.

So you want to be rentners without paying rent? okay cool

This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.

lol this is pretty great. Let's go in order:
---
* be a director/corp leader/alliance leader of a moderately wealthy corp
---
* have a lot of isk already
---
* be one of a few people performing a time-intensive and risky service
---
* having corpmates with 100b or so they're willing to loan you
---
* be a corp/alliance leader
---
* be one of the handful of people who find an officer each morning
---
It sounds so simple! Why didn't everyone just become a corp or alliance leader, or simply hunt officers right after downtime? God we're all so _stupid_
---
Naw I left them out on purpose because they have become the corruption of the old barroom podcast.

I mean, this is the very height of chutzpah. A nullsecer, the source of all the AFK farming and free ISK in the game, claiming that wormholes, not null, is the place the nerf hammer needs to fall.
---
Yeah, wormhole ratting can be high reward. But (unlike nullsec) it's *also high risk*. It's nullsec that needs rebalancing, maybe not in ISK terms but certainly in risk terms.

Eve TV would be terrible. Eve is only interesting because of what real people do to each other over a video game. I don't care about rando amarr slave #127567 cleaning toilets on a Avatar. Now the story of some nerd no lifing it 24/7 to steal 400 billion in Corp assets after two years of deep cover, somewhat interesting. For 15 minutes.
---
And they don't join fleets fuck them!!!
---
and now here we are. Eve is a very old game; it will change many times, sometimes circling back and going back to the way things used to be as the situation warrants.
---
No. You are mearly competition for people who are paying their dues or their rent. There is no such thing as a free lunch.
---
Being able to blow up asteroids (without mining them) would be pretty good tbh.

Where the fuck does any of my messages implies that ? If you played for 6 years and farmed a lot by today standart it's more than doable, especially if you trained a cap char early one. The issue is how one groud pop them like crazy while in a super safe disposition.

Good news. I‚Äôve spoken to my good friend The Mittani and he‚Äôs prepared to support you. What you need to do to proceed is contact any of the GSF directors and contract all your corp belongings to one of them so they can go through proper Delve customs clearance. You also need to pay a security deposit of 10 billion isk to Goonwaffe which will be returned when you vacate Delve.

Is this another post about Goons being Elite while they are just 20 times more than everybody else ?
---
no, it's not subjective though.
---
i've literally outlined what they already earn - anything that earns less won't be worth it.
---
"do you want to earn less isk? no thanks" having the value of their time reduced is worthwhile in literally no situation ever.
---
You need to watch Open Comms. We had Grath calling Dirk a piece of shit like two weeks ago. 
---
It doesn't, really, because there is no 'so many jumps out' that's consistent and intel channels don't get populated so easily (a cynic would say, doesn't get populated by local-reading bots).

You want to be a renter dude. You just dont know it. 
---
If you are in Null you are going to be hunted (esp if you are using rorqs) So PVP will find you even if you dont want it. 
---
No large alliance is going to take a 40 man indy corp but thier renters might. Something like Living Breathing fuel blocks might be a good idea. Not sure if they actually take corps but they try to help each other when hunters are about.

My advice is to just avoid dropping your own POCOs. you will rarely turn a profit from them and you will be wardec'd right away by someone who just wants to kick over your sand castle.  Join a nullsec coalition that has little to no taxes on their use.
---
We at Smartbomb Syndicate would like to offer our condolences to these novice experienced t3c smart bombers. In the future what we would suggest you do is have your Blops ships do the smart bombing with the panther since it has 8 slots.

You micro jump drive as ships hit the grid, and then bomb as they land, your spool timer should go off a second or so after they land and you bombed, then you can cloak or warp off effectively.

Everyone has a sabre alt. If you want to know how many real people are in a WH fleet just count the sabres. 
---
Can't, not until i've got my mortgage sorted. No extraneous transactions on the credit report and all that.
---
So every single person in high sec who could be subject to war decs is making 900 mil a week running incursions?  I don't think so. 
---
Further, the whole idea that the only way to make something "worthwhile" is through isk is simply not true. People are willing to engage in mechanics that generate less isk if the content is fun and interesting. If your attitude is correct, nobody would undock a titan anywhere unless they could be sure they would make more money than losing it would cost them. 
---
The determination of what is meaningful for somebody is subjective. There are things I do in this game daily for free, and things that make large amounts of isk that I simply won't do. The determination of what makes something worthwhile is up to an individual to determine. 
---
In this instance, having some kind of reward beyond personal satisfaction may (note the MAY) help get these folks to undock. You don't think it's enough to get you to undock, that's fair. But I don't think it's a good idea to assume that your opinions are simply "arithmetic" when they are wrapped as much in opinion and personal pref

this is why many US-only based websites who do not want the overhead of GDPR compliance are blocking EU ip addresses until the full scope of GDPR is worked out in the courts and internationally.

This idea is actually really important because one it makes it so gate campers and lowsec/high sec gankers can potentially steal this loot so it brings more content, it also punishes stupid botters, and it makes all of new eden more active in terms of travelling.

I was busy with real life for the last 10 years and couldn't start playing before 2018 so can I please get all the skillpoints I lost in this time?
---
However you nerf "that one group popping titans like crazy" will just nerf smaller groups to a greater degree (nerf rorqual yield by 10% then with 1 rorqual you need 60 hours extra mining for a titan, or there about, but if you have 10 rorquals then its only 6 more hours to get a titan). 
---
The problem is one group is efficient and the others are less efficient. If goons collectively quit the game today suddenly you'd be crying about the second place efficiency group being more efficient than the rest. 
---
How about people instead started running faster instead of trying to nerf the fastest runner? 
---
A drone-less Astero is much worse than flying a Probe - you are worth 20-50x as much, so effectively have a target on your back, and you can't defend yourself (drones are the only weapon for an Astero).  Stick with the Probe until:
---
You get most drone skills to IV, light drones to V, and at least one faction drone skill started up to I/II.  Get Cloaking IV so you can use the covops cloak.  Then buy your Astero.  (Put the T2 tank skills in queue too, they help a lot - especially Hull Upgrades V.)  You also want to make sure both frigate skills (Gallente and Amarr) are up to IV at least, they help your damage and tank.
---
One other thought, with the Astero you might have 2 or 3 different fits (one for scanning, one for hunting, one for actually running sites), so you probably want to think about carrying a mobile depot to refit based on the situation, if you are out for a lengthy roam.  It can be really annoying to be in the wrong fit when you happen to find someone to hunt though... so there is some give and take there.  There is no "perfect" Astero fit, it's all tradeoffs based on what you want to optimize for.

WH Isk is burst ISK. WH sites don‚Äôt instantly respawn. This means you can make a load of ISK/hr for maybe a couple of hours then potentially have zero sites to run for days.

Thank you for agreeing with me? I've lived in wormholes for years, I'm pretty sure I know what eol means.
---
I have seen wormholes live beyond four hours of being eol. Or my computer clock and Tripwire, or now siggy, are in kahoots. I've never seen it five hours. Only four and change. Can't tell you why, or even if the wormhole still works, I most certainly don't jump a hole that's beyond four hours eol 
---
&gt; However you nerf "that one group popping titans like crazy" will just nerf smaller groups to a greater degree (nerf rorqual yield by 10% then with 1 rorqual you need 60 hours
---
What is ridiculous in the current situation is the current situation is the ability to park hundreads of rorquals in a single region safely behind supers. Nerfig rorquals would not hit the small group more, just equally, but people aren't asking for a rorqual mining amount nerf, they are asking so that a single region of space cannot hold 30k people without much issues. Goons sure are organized, but it sure a lot easier to be the "first runner" when the game super heavily benefit turbo krabbing in turtle position while not doing anything except light harassment while others people, you know, want to have fun, how dare they.
---
Congratz you have the strongest most empire in a now very boring game.
---
They are very different kinds of games, but they have many of the same difficulties. To be honest I think eve has aged better than WoW. WoW's playerbase is just suffering endlessly because they are 100% dependent on content. Eve content creators are players; CCP just has to not fuck it up (though on this point CCP is borderline...)

Well, having had a second look, hull is close to 300, sooner then it depends on the fitting. Without blinging, 3 Hulks are quite close to 1 Excavator in price.
---
&gt;And you're also operating under the assumption that they'd be making 900 mil a week with an active war dec - they'd be making zero.
---
i didn't say 900 at all, but that's besides the point. and no shit they'd make zero - because it wouldn't be worth logging in to participate unless they were making an equal amount.
---
Why join our shit alliance 
---
Who knew old fogies in the retirement home weren't that good. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
No idea about big stuff, I can‚Äôt fly anything bigger than a cruiser.
---
I think you are trying to be funny but that was the reality of the game ten years ago. 99.9999% of players didn't have a chance of getting a titan. 
---
Now however, hard work equals a titan for anyone and everyone who wants one. 
---
So I guess you have to attract players willing to put in that effort to your alliance, if you want to be a major player a few years in the future. 
---
FRT has a big future certainly, NCdot is also getting into manufacturing and mining, TEST and goons are already known to do mining and manufacturing, but the rest are still on the individual member level mining and manufacturing. Which isn't very efficient. A structure costs as much fuel if two characters build in it, or twenty. 
---
It's unfair to lump spod brains in with Stainguy
---
know what'd be more risky than having excavators out? having to mine in a fucking mining ship.

---
This is a good post and I thank you for it, but my main thinking isn't about an assault of Delve. That, as you said, is a fortress and would be pointless to attack. However, my main thinking is if Goons begin to stage their assets outside of Delve in a significant quantity. This opens their supply line up for attack. The systems that they stage in won't be a fortress. 
---
If say Goons do something stupid and take on rest of Eve they would need to stage up North to fight NC., in Geminate or near to fight PL PH, and then they would Beed to stage down south for TEST. This might not be winnable. But I don't think Goons are that stupid. 
---
Anyway, I'm having fun fighting TEST and Goons in Geminate.

O.o I'm out here trying to come up with bc/bs solo pvp fits, getting info from someone who can only fly cruisers. How you know your game has way too much shit to learn. Skill queue remaining: forever

Look at r/evejobs for a C2 or C3 WH corp that accepts newbies.  Most corps will be happy to have another person scanning/exploring the chain, and you'll have an Astrahus/Fortizar to call home, makes exploring a good bit easier.  You can train into other things as you build up your wallet exploring.
---
Who cares , Stainguy shitpost
---
&gt; This won't apply to the greater majority of EVE corps, don't let the GDPR boogieman scare you.
---
So that GDPR notice I sent via EVE Mail last year was really just trolling after all?
---
&gt; right now, you can actually catch up to our titan numbers by doing what we do more effectively
---
&gt; What I'm arguing is that one shouldn't discount the work of the empire that makes building those titans possible
---
get the "work of the empire", divide it by 40k chars, it suddenly looks like jack shit. Smaller groups work far harder per individual than these nullblocs, the difference is that you have 40% of ns or some shit

You can't fight game mechanics that are geared towards the Goon industrialization gameplay. While those are in place, or without other sweeping changes to titan blobbing, yes, other people that don't want to play that way can't be bothered to try and win on those terms.
---
Be careful for we have no less then 12 spies in NCdotte who can do the same!

And this has to do with what you said... how? You're still nerd shaming. This is Eve Online. Don't be dense.
---
No this is my thread, and all about me. Stop being negative you fascist shit.
---
Um, math is hard I guess. 
---
You are not rolling for one wormhole when there's dozens with sites being run. You're rolling for any of them. 
---
Ayyyy
---
&gt; they leave their more valuable central regions vulnerable.
---
it would be not nearly as vulnerable as you think it would be, given that with the new jump gates you can cover 2 regions in about 5 minutes travel time with a full fleet. All that would happen is several new keeps would be placed to baby sit new jump gates and imperium would hold 3-4 regions instead of two and likewise with legacy any attempt to invade would be met with a response that takes minutes due to the jump bridge highway, its nice to think a nerf to anoms would help the north but in the end it would cost them part of their space.
---
No keep them alpha until they hit 5m training for free.  Then activate the galaxy pack and train for the 30 day omega. So you should be close to 7m. Extract the 2m sp and sell everything then flog the toon on the bazaar. 
---
The last barrier
---
Not really. You remember the mackinaw multiboxer (Silverminer - has 45 mackinaws per system in 2 systems) who regularly got bombed? I bombed him twice. He learned how to deal with it and does not get bombed anymore.
---
Risk also has to do with how much money you have on the field. A few barges don't cost that much to be risky unless you run at the Silverminer level.
---
Rorquals in themselves aren't a problem. Nor Excavators, nor PANIC. The fact that you can stack so many of them in a single capital umbrella, and the fact that you can multibox so many of them is the problem.
---
I'm sure Provi will take you in, just message someone from -7- or CVA to get your process started!
---
Tell that to the Hawks guy who fed three nags to hk less than a week ago. Zero risk, unless someone rolls in to you 
---
It helps that Ron is probably the nicest dinoposter in the known universe.
---
For the record, we dont control our FCs. We let them run around screaming like the autistic eve players they truly are. And we love them the more for it.
---
TEST is almost permanently deployed away from Esoteria, yet we're doing just fine. You say that you want people to bring fleets into your area, yet just last night Horde rage formed 110 man Muninn fleet while batphoning a Sleipnir fleet from PL because there was some Goon Jackdaws roaming their space. You know who actually has literally never deployed away from their krabbing space? Horde lol. Just because your leadership has literally siphoned trillions of isk instead of attempting to build a functional infrastructure for your alliance, or pay out SRP, doesn't mean the system is broken, it just means your alliance is shitty.
---
Playing field's even, friend. We did X rate of work time Y dudes. Eve patches X to be a tenth of what it was. What happens then? That's right, our Y is uncatchable, because we're still doing the same magnitude of work, even if the multiplier from game mechanics is different.
---
&gt;given that with the new jump gates
---
&gt;new keeps would be placed to baby sit new jump gates
---
&gt;met with a response that takes minutes due to the jump bridge highway
---
its almost like those problems are tied to something other than anoms and therefore should be changed separetely
---
hmmmm
---
i'll be honest.
---
i don't give a fuck about risk. i'm just salty that mining ships actually suck for mining and if you want to mine you buy a boosting ship with some dumbfuck drones.

I'm sorry that you think exceptions to the rule mean anything. Your argument is trash and so is your attitude.

Thanks for your honesty. Yeah I can see how it can be a bad experience from a game enjoyment perspective. Rorquals are not so bad for the game ecosystem itself except some particular aspects of them.

Additionally, there would be an incentive for krabs to join different alliances. krabbing space might be in short supply around delve, but plentiful in the east.

This might even out the membership count amongst alliances.

A few months ago I posted a middle ground solution to this problem. Basically it is possible to motivate empires to spread out, yet leave space to smaller entities. Here is the link.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/

The current path actually brings us closer to Serenity. Because it provides the coalition with the largest capital umbrella with further exponential growth unlike any smaller coalition.

Just get a cloaky Epi and pop out to low sec.  the only thing you need to undock for us using the spaceport/customs office and the initial command center placement.  
---
Set your pi in station while watching local then when you‚Äôre comfortable you‚Äôre alone or the others in system are harmless (takes some scouting and recon but doable) undock; warp to customs office &amp; cloak up.  
---
Once you‚Äôre at station manage your import/export.

The low sec customs offices are like 2-5% with skills.  Don‚Äôt pay the high sec extortion.  It‚Äôll only take a few weeks of t3 production to save the taxes to cover your fitting costs.

---

---
Yeah a dread just makes sense here.
---
Imagine if all games gave you all the stuff even if not playing
---
What are you even saying? These mechanics weren't tailored to goons. Every single proposed "solution" in this thread has been something that would cripple everybody but goons. Stop being bad. 
---
&gt; securing the space that they own to the extent that goons have
---
People need as large a capital umbrella to secure their space as goons have. They don't have that. So they need to be blue to Goons like TEST. If they aren't, they can't do what Goons have been doing. 
---
It's not like other people are lazy. It's just a game design issue. There is only one slot for a single coalition to do Goon style vertical farming in this game, because it requires maintaining the largest capital umbrella. For everyone else, Goons can come and mess up their ratting the moment they recruit hundreds of Rorquals and go up in MERs. This game design lead to every person into Rorqual mining eventually joining Goons. For other alliances, there is no PvE'rs to recruit to even start mining as much as Goons now.
---
So people point out these problems. But Goons like to proudly reinforce their space cult myth of "other people are too lazy".
---
concernedeve - you are correct to an extent - I did bitch at him for whelping the fleet because I could not have attended his fleet. Its fun as hell. You should join next time. 
---
Wow's player base is suffering because of the class design, the content is perfectly fine tbh.
---
What i was talking about tho was cries to bring back the 'the old ways' of doing things and how they were just better and would still be better than the way that it is now. For wow i know that's almost entirely untrue and rose tinted goggles are at play there. 
---
Which makes it a bit odd looking at eve doing the same thing, because i didn't have enough experience with the old system to know if it was better or worse i only have the mirror image of the same thing happening in wow to go by. my gut instinct says no the systems aren't just better.

Does it matter what filament type you run? What do you prefer for this fit?
---
you need to press what? one button per hour on the tidi shitfests in a titan? it scales to the number of accounts your pc can handle. Also having more titans does scale linearly because once critical mass is achieved what matters is how many titans you can replace, not how many more you can field, unless you can double the critical mass and make two volley squads I guess but at thst point..,

Ps, what thread are they referring to?
---
So maybe second or third Titans was a bad example.  Maybe dudes get AT ship habits or something.
---
My point was that after a certain point, more mining does not equal more power.
---
Also, there's a limit to how much shit you can get on grid before the node crashes.  You'll eventually hit that limit too.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;ok
---
Truth hurts and doesn‚Äôt care about your feeling. Sorry bud.
---
I'm sure you believe that. But at some point, the truth will start to gnaw around at the edges of your mind.
---
At first you might be able to ignore it by spinning up the 8th Rorq toon, or ship spinning your Avatar AND your Erebus at the same time. Maybe calling out some whiners on r/eve because they can't compete with the industrial might of the GSF, fuckin' LOSER nerds. But soon, not even trying to fuck your August Ames (RIP) model fleshlight is going to distract you from thinking about why no one actually cares about you.
---
The astero is an odd ship. PVP is a bit of a game of cat and mouse and the Astero doesn't really seem to know if it wants to be a cat or a mouse. If you want to explore, a covops is better. If you want to hunt, a Stratios is better. You can hunt other explorers with an Astero sure, but you're not guaranteed to win.

---
No argument here that some of the changes proposed in this thread would go against the Goons play style. I'm all for that.
---
With CCP making no meaningful positive changes to faction warfare in the past few years, how will this campaign differ from previous bang-head-against-FW-mechanics campaigns?

Have you ever even looked at the victor in pyfa?
---
Have s good fit for 2018/19 meta? Also, is it worth it to also leave one relic in a stratios, for when you‚Äôre out of luck and have nothing else to do?
---
Usually when I look at variations for a mod I see a bunch of meta mods. Which ones are the best or are they all have different perks?
---
That is a painful way to lose a ship.
---
&gt;Also, there's a limit to how much shit you can get on grid before the node crashes. You'll eventually hit that limit too.
---
that's irrelevant, both sides will always bring as much as they can regardless, worst case scenario you just shut down the opponents staging.
---
&gt;So maybe second or third Titans was a bad example. Maybe dudes get AT ship habits or something.
---
doesn't that applies to both sides? also the type of player who is turbokrabbing his third titan doesn't seem like the profile for AT ships eh
---
Agreed. Shit on kugu was peak podcasting

It's well known that /u/machinum_corp which is an alt of /u/en_bludclart (the CEO of Machinum) is an autismo sperglord of the highest caliber. What makes it even funnier is that when he's not trying to flex so hard on reddit and call other people retard faggot cucks (his words not mine) is that he shows a completely different side to himself on /r/evejobs, where he excitedly tries to wrangle people to join his little fief. Obviously, [he's been called out on this before](https://www.reddit.com/r/evejobs/comments/a2gyrf/returning_100_million_sp_player_looking_for_a_home/eb02fn0/?context=0) given that people can look at your post history and see what a massive fucking tool you are, but that hasn't stopped /u/machinum_corp / u/en_bludclart from being such an idiot.
---
I was going by the numbers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5bp0sm/mining_yield_with_the_november_update/), which lists a max skill Rorqual as doing 891km3 an hour, while a hulk does 116k. So assuming the Rorqual hasn't had its mining ability nerfed to a third of what it used to be, it should be about 1 hulks to 8 Rorquals.
---
if you give the hulks max Rorqual boosts as well, then you are looking at about a rate of 3.5:1 for Hulks to Rorquals, but since we're putting one ship up against another, it doesn't make sense to factor in Rorqual boosts for the Hulks.

1. problematic, in some countries it is illegal to employ activity tracking software like keyloggers and would have legal consequences for CCP. In order to circumvent this, they'd have to lock out entire regions, which would ultimately kill their business.
---
2. I can agree on that one. At some point I'd hold corporations and alliances accountible and eventually seize any ISK depending on the weight of the case. This would be a measure to incentivize bot intolerance.
---
3. This would only lead to an "evolution" of bots with lightly randomised move directions and click times.
---
4. There already is a bot police, it just needs to be more than just two guys.

Somebody say free faxes?!??!?

All of the changes proposed would hurt people who are NOT goons.

Being Organized and actually supporting your line members isn't every-bodies cup of tea but it should be. You aren't paying attention or you are trolling.

Oh I guess you are right I guess it was easy to find the originality in your broadcasts.

Unlike other entities, the goal of protecting the base line members and helping them kill baddies, particularly those that follow some super simple guidelines and fits, comes from the very top to the very bottom of the leadership base.
---
Test operates in a similar vein.
---
If we look at the MER delve has a huge amount of shit getting killed, removing panic is a terrible idea, 
---
Bosuns while I dont really do titans, used carefully and strategically can be a bonus to the little guy.
---
&gt; Now however, hard work equals a titan for anyone and everyone who wants one.
---
Is it hard work, though? Or is it just time? The game is not well-balanced for massive supercap vs. supercap fights. They were never designed to be mainline fleet doctrines. Arguing that somehow we're better off now because anyone with hundreds of hours to multibox ratters or rorqs can get a titan seems like a particularly narrow-minded viewpoint.
---
Eve has never been a theme park. It's been a sandbox. You aren't supposed to get a titan just because you want one - and this is by design. It was never meant to be an attainable goal for everyone in the game to have one. It's like the Jedi class from the old Star Wars: Galaxies. It's not _supposed_ to be common and that's why it's special and powerful. You can argue until you're blue in the face that we *can* all get a titan with just "hard work." But that won't make me believe, after playing this game now for 14 years, that we *should* all get titans.
---
I'm only downvoting because that's what everyone else is doing and I fold easily to peer pressure and for this, I am ashamed.
---
I don't get why it wouldn't be worth logging in to make some money rather than not logging in and making nothing.  That doesn't make a lot of sense to me. 
---
My point about the titan wasn't applying null sec logic - it was applying basic logic.  Why undock anything of value if there is more risk it's going to get blown up than isk you'll be able to generate with it?  That's the attitude you're advocating, and I think it's proven wrong every single day by players in every area of space. There are things that motivate more than simply isk. But in the absence of those things, isk is also a good motivator. 
---
The most extremely risk averse people who do not want to PvP and don't want to be war decced at all already have two options. This idea is not for them. 
---
And how many kids do you have that will be sponsoring this dad joke today?
---
They've been undocking a ton actually and ganging up with Horde too
---
Them and all their skill farmers.
---
Ok.
---
None I know about and have to feed. IDGAF about the rest
---
well fuck... there goes my Eve is dying theory.
---
This conversation is in the context of if anom respawn methods were changed to be like WHs - i.e., when a site is run, it respawns in some system in the same region after a delay. As of right now TEST could double the number of toons, sure (just look at Delve). If such a change were made (lol) that would absolutely not be the case.
---
So pointing out obvious things...
---
You're going places kid maybe you can co-host with Artimus Albosa that will be amazing content!!!
---
&gt;This is a fairly detailed fantasy
---
I mean you're the one admitting to living, for the most part, in a digital fantasy world. I put it in to terms you could relate too.
---
Do you have any data on the new jump gate usage or lo burn?
---
just general overall stats would be cool, regional might give to much data.
---
No, that's you projecting. I said nothing of the sort. 
---
fun fact, stain guy rarely, if ever shits on goons directly, its mostly the north.

Quit during Burning Crusade so I would have had to be ten shots deep to be in ICC as well so I get that point.

Don't worry about it; Doom's not exactly known for the accuracy of his predictions 'round these parts.
---
You're making crabbing look fun. Stop.
---
I live in WH but love roaming null. It's hit and miss but after doing it a while you'll see improvements in planning and pilotting
---
I like to fly my Enyo and occasionally a T1 ship on a roam, ganking miners and ratters is a good way to provoke the local bees nest. Then you just bait and fight what you can

Funny line, coming from the guy who's so insecure that he projects his private life on others in a sad attempt to assuage his broken ego.
---
I actually thought the Bhaal was there as a great counter to the Dreks. Break ramp up dps and shit all over any active hardeners we had. Against regular passive armor fleets, yeah not too useful. But against 1/2 our fleet, great :D
---
No problem we understand how much time it takes to provide the perfectly formated and polished edition.

Nobody would ever mistake Open Comms for TIS, lol.

Totes projecting, you caught me!
---
One is faster at chasing people in warp one is faster at chasing people sub warp.
---
I take it you're basically still a newbie. So here's my two cents;
---
1. Try mining last of anything. Somehow I think mining is sort of an early dead end, it's dull and repetitive, especially in highsec. Explore the other gameplays first, there's exploration, pve, pvp, trading and a lot of other things to explore. As long as you are in highsec, you can still "waste" a few SP left and right, because usually content has a fairly low bar of entry. You'll find what itches you at some point, and that's when you can specialise.
---
2. Don't be scared of lowsec, nullsec, wormspace. Yes, certain risks of dying exist, but the rewards might be worth it.
---
3. Look for a corporation. It's important to note; you pick your corp. There are plenty of large and small corps to choose from. Depending on the game you want to play, you can either join one of the large corps or a small corp. It all depends on what kind of atmosphere you prefer. Large corps can be quite impersonal and hard for you to make a name, while small corps can have more of a family type of atmosphere.
---
4. Eve Uni Wiki is your friend.

Truth be told, I thought really hard on what Stainguy imagery I could toss on the label. But I came up with nothing, so I just tossed some "Grr Goons" and a Dickbutt for good measure just to make this look even more low effort.
---
Could just leave the siege core off as well... or not use both mining lasers. Anything else you want to leave out when posing the absolute maximums of two ships?
---
who's your favourite raifu
---
For an auditory learner like me there's is always a clear...difference. 
---
Wait tri was there???
---
What is a "raifu"? 
---
I thought so as well at first, but only the Claw the other ceptor of its race. All the others are roughly the same and the Ares is even faster than the Taranis.
---
wtf I love gobbins now
---
It likely won't differ, but its 2-3 weeks of constant logging in, getting in ships, warping to plex, killing shit, dying, reshipping, going back etc.
---
Fast paced, super fun dank pvp where all the content is within 20au. We had huola at the most violent lowsec system the other night whilst playing around with the minmatar to feel the resistance, so expect alot more of it.
---
Point is that you can always roll Officer mod for a small chance of getting better stats. And that small probability is why they cost that much, not the stats. 
---
Concernedeve can‚Äôt wait for the audio. Hopefully its not one of Francis‚Äôs fapping sessions that he blames on his mic/fan combo. You should solicit the opinion of other Evictus members who can help shed light on the true workings of our alliance. Do we have problems? Sure... Be it our disproportional number of Canadians in positions of importance, or failed programs like our 2018 Free FAUXs giveaways; and  lets not forget the tragic Toronto meet up where we double booked with the Scientologists at the Ramada. We got problems, yes even some big problems but this is still the best darn botting alliance in EVE and I‚Äôll be damned if I let you besmirch our leadership or the names of some of our great VNI pilots like mnjk kjhgfdssffd or qwertyu Jhgfsf121! Have you no shame sir?
---
Never trusted those greeters.

---
I'm not a big fan of Evictus since I had to read one of their members ranting about muslims and immigrants in the German ingame help chat.
---
Yeah I know. I have a tengu. It's just amazing all the little things I forget or never learned on my journey through eve
---
no they just anchored a fortizar and then left
---
just a guess but you peaked in this sub
---
Because CCP is a mess of incoherent game designers.
---
There are 'fleet' interceptors and 'combat' interceptors.  [As Eve-Uni summarizes](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Interceptors#Overview): *There are two types of interceptor: interceptors designed purely for tackling ("tackle" or "fleet" inties), and interceptors designed for  combat ("gank", "damage", "damage-dealing" or "combat" inties). Each of  the four races has one interceptor of each type.*
---
I think you are discounting the importance of a few things: for example, fleet interceptors get a 5% bonus to scram/disruptor range *per level*, are interdiction nullified, and align and warp much quicker than assault frigates.  The current meta is often in a fleet situation, an interceptor gets initial (light) tackle and then hands off to a (heavy) tackle assault frigate when main fleet lands on the target.
---
As for the combat interceptors... well yeah basically what happened to these (the ones you are focusing on) is that **they were screwed recently (interdiction nullification removed) and it seems the developers don't have an idea of what to do with them yet**.  Hence why when the change was announced/went into effect, those hulls dropped significantly in price and use, and more assault frigates (previously often a *'why would these ever be used'* ship class) appeared in fleets to take the place of combat interceptors as damage-dealing tackle.
---
The other one is basically useless now
---
So after comparing the two (Ares and Tyranis) it looks like the Tyranis is supposed to be tougher than the Ares. 
---
It has more armor and more hull. It can fit 3 guns with an extra utility high and 2 drones. 
---
I think they need to take it a lil further though because 25 extra armor and 50 extra hull isn't going to make much of a difference.
---
the sole guideposts for How Goons Play The Game are:
---
1) i win
---
2) you lose
---
3) fuck you
---
people have this silly idea that if suddenly things changed to reward a different playstyle we'd suddenly keep playing the way we currently do instead of develop a new way to adhere to the Three Laws of Goonism
---
&gt;doesn't that applies to both sides? also the type of player who is turbokrabbing his third titan doesn't seem like the profile for AT ships eh
---
No, not at all. Read the OP. You've missed the point.
---
300 billion isk of corp assets says what?
---
Instead of a boosh it creates a vortex to stain, from lowsec
---
It's strange how many think the opposite of Gobbins.
---
has anyone checked if baki yuku and gobbins sound the same on mumble
---
obvious flair bait
---
It‚Äôs not your gut. It‚Äôs the data too. Uncontrollable isk inflation WILL ruin the game. The economy is very different from other mmos. Wow‚Äôs economy (I haven‚Äôt played in years but...) is a really poor thing to compare to - the economy is entirely driven by the developers and players can have little influence on it. 
---
Level = master
---
1 cant be held down by non-targeted interdiction
---
The other we pretend it does not exist.
---
NEAR is good, but a not AFK player can still read a Intel Chat, maybe use the ingame tool to highlight system names 1\~2 jumps out and you are done, not as good as NEAR, but still 100% legal without a 3th party tool.
---
/u/concernedeve is a reddit account almost certainly owned by Evertrader, the leader of Lord of Worlds Alliance. I know this because I was in that alliance. If you don't know who that is, it's a pretty mediocre alliance that hates Evictus. I don't like Evictus either, but this is just shit-tier posting. Especially because everything that makes Evictus bad can also be applied to Lord of Worlds Alliance.

Meta Mods - Generally Meta stuff is better than the baseline, but not quite as good as a Tech II mod.  Some meta mods (compact/restrained) have less fitting/capacitor needs than the baseline or Tech II stuff.

---
I'm not comparing the games. They are completely apples to oranges i'm comparing the communities.
---
A minor nitpick, but some of the anoms do work this way. That's why there are anoms in places like Venal. IHUB spawned anoms are a separate mechanic, and what people usually complain about.
---
Not really, It's not strange at all. Stockholm Syndrome is a very real thing and can happen in a variety of situations involving a coercive power dynamic. 
---
Wow LORDE really who the hell is this fuck.  You are so full of yourself.  
---
&gt; People need as large a capital umbrella to secure their space as goons have. They don't have that. So they need to be blue to Goons like TEST. If they aren't, they can't do what Goons have been doing. 
---
Why do so many people in Eve have goldfish like memories? TEST didn't blue Goons as a requirement of building a capital fleet. TEST did that all on our own. We blued Goons after the west side of map declared war on us. 
---
This is train spotting tier gay.
---
And the first it appears 
---
And that is exactly how I rat/mine/bait. Keep an eye on Intel and have local highlighted, and you should be okay. Near is different. You can be completely AFK watching pornhub, as long as you have near open you're good. 
---
Thank you much appreciated.
---
The alliance may be elite as hell, but this is our corporation Svea Rike [.S.R.] we're talking about!
---
A true fact is that the elite-ness of NC. and the elite-ness of the rest of EVE both sank drastically when Svea Rike [.S.R.] re-joined NC.!
---
So, anyway, Svea Rike [.S.R.] are the oldest, still active and largest all-Swedish nullsec-pvp corp in all of EVE-Online (yes, we do pvp sometimes!).
---
Mining was a thing back in the early days of EVE, when we mined our first Battleships using cruisers. Took months, and then we promptly whelped them in pvp - those where the days when Battleships where the biggest ships, and Kings in EVE; priceless ships! That's how seriously Svea Rike [.S.R.] approached those new powerful ships in those days!
---
And we've been doing exactly that in nullsec for about 13 years now, always whelping good ships while beeing constantly vastly outnumbered by blobbing kids with running noses. And maybe we've been a tiny bit "tipsy"...but we've been part of all the major (and most minor) nullsec wars in the history of EVE-Online.
---
Otherwise, the last 10 years or so, mining has not really been our thing, but the meta in EVE has changed and so have we. 
---
So there we where tonight. Mining.
---
IRL we are a bunch of rather mature Swedish gentlemen (several well over 50 years, some below) with ordinary jobs like ex-army-officer gone international weapons-dealer, truck drivers, teachers, carpenters, prison-guards, furniture sales guys, architects, software developers and doctors that enjoy drinking and playing EVE together. Usually at the same time.
---
Props to the guys(s) that scouted us, you have good intel! We never saw any neut, red or blue in the vicinity of us. Only our own corp members where in local... hmm.... well, who cares, this is EVE after all! Spying is a fun part of the game!
---
It was also spot on straight journey for the hunter up from the WH (?) four jumps out, with no detours at all, and fast action, good combat probing (Rorquals, so...not so tricky maybe) and warping at 100 and quick covert cyno. 
---
We had had intel before on a 100 man Tengu/Loki fleet in Obe forming, so we knew something was about. We talked about it, and when the scout/hunter was pinged four jumps out, we directly de-cycled the Rorquals and most (10-12 Rorqs or so, and some 5-6 Hulks) got off the field safe, but 4 Rorqs did not since they where just in the beginning of their cycles, so 3 of them got killed, one got out in the end (since a 150 man Tengu/Loki-repper/SB-fleet did not dare to take a fight with a 80-man Ferox fleet)
---
We threw in some FAX:es in the fight, to delay a bit while a fleet was on the way up, and for the bloody fun of it (that's how seriously SVea Rike [.S.R.] takes this). It turned out to be buffer armour FAXes (except a Ninazu) and we laughed at that on corp Discord, but we blame that entirely on our old age, bad eyesight, colour blindness, shaky old hands that miss-click stuff, and the booze. Mostly the booze.
---
Svea Rike - clearly least elite in NC. but more elite than the rest of EVE!
---
Also, and foremost, a lot of "espri", a lot of fun together in our small Swedish corp-community! 
---
...but of course, after these really REALLY serious event for our corp, I as CEO need to have a SERIOUS talk to my corpies. Especially to "Johan"....

Even though this was a new alt account I created, I think this is a good step in trying to make the game seem more friendly to newbros. While the gifts aren't magnificent(which honestly they shouldn't be) I am glad to see CCP reaching out in the very beginning.
---
Did not know that it cooled, very great full for the info. Thank you.

IHUB anoms have always been like this? (ie you don't have to scan them?)

Just lurking and curious: what does renting cost a month? Rough estimation? Taking into account small to medium corp size. 
---
no it's not.
---
The more information that comes out, the more it seems that Pandemic Horde has been a massive embezzlement scam by Gobbins and/or other Horde leadership and/or NCPL masters?  All the money coming in but apparently little being paid out in SRP or in establishing infrastructure... ***where did it go?***
---
Or the other way of looking at it... The 1st one is always free, you need to pay for your addiction afterwards, with cold floppy credit cards.
---
eve shop is still so underwhelming
---
Still waiting on those dank leaks you claim to have. 
---
As /u/Stukya said, they used to both be invulnerable to non-targeted/area-of-effect warp interdiction, i.e. "bubbles." Because of that, they were still used in some situations. For example, the Raptor was not entirely shit as a tackle interceptor, and it was certainly better than the Crow. Also, Claws were used as "fozzie claws" to entosis the new sovereignty structures back when interceptors could fit entosis links, due to their mobility, damage, and interdiction nullification. Even after they were made unable to fit entosis links, they were used to quickly move around a constellation and alpha off the field anyone who tried to entosis. But now that they get caught by bubbles, they're mostly obsolete, since that makes them much easier to catch and kill, defeating their main advantage.

from your own link :

Examples of allowed Input Broadcasting and Input Multiplexing are  actions taken that do not have an impact on the EVE universe and are  carried out for convenience:  
---
‚Ä¢	EVE Online client settings   
---
‚Ä¢	Window positions and arrangements (of the EVE Online client in your operating system‚Äôs desktop environment)  
---
‚Ä¢	The login process
---
You were talking about the respawn mechanic, not the scan mechanic, I thought? Re: the scan mechanic, rat anoms had to be probed, but you could generally do this with the onboard 2AU scanner with no probes.
---
The short version is that the combat interceptors have been victims of their own success over the years. In the past seven years, all four of them have been (at different times) the best or among the best small ships for combat (or for specific tactics) of any frigate, which made them the most-used ships in the game. 
---
In practice, CCP will let that go on for a few years, then the most-used sub-caps in the game at that point just get nerfed into the ground in the name of "balance".
---
To use my own favorite example, there was about a three-year period where the Taranis was just a terrifying close-range combat ship, able to do upwards of 270+ DPS in a package that was almost impossible to catch unless he wanted to be caught, but still absurdly tough and resilient. Knock another frigate into hull and that pilot is sure he's going to lose. Knock a Ranis into hull back in the ship's prime, and the pilot knows the fight's just getting good. ;-)
---
No doubt about it. The two links provided are actually helpful unlike fucking Aura in the tutorial.
---
I think i'm not on the same page as the rest of you.
---
A typical system is 3b/month
---
&gt; because a supercap umbrella from 1 or 2 staging systems can cover all the space for 10,000+ alts to krab in.
---
And a supercap umbrella from 3 staging systems is not an improvement.  Especially when that means there's no space for anyone else to "grow up" in.
---
Right now, TEST could easily split the cap fleet guarding Esoteria into three fleets guarding Esoteria, Paragon Soul and Impass, and easily crush any roam.  Someone who managed to surprise us with a cap escalation could be counter-dropped after 1 mid from Esoteria, which is pretty fast after the latest fatigue changes.  Yeah, we'd lose renters, but ratters pay more.
---
Panfam could do the same.  Goons could do the same with 4-5 regions.  There would be an initial shuffle, but then we settle in to the same blocs, now owning more of the map.
---
&gt; Getting sick of people like you resisting literally any change because it's gonna "hurt the little guy". Stop talking shit.
---
Getting sick of people like you unable to think of anything beyond last night's roam.  The coalitions you are attempting to break up are not going to react the way you think they will.
---
Is that an unmade bed in the background?!
---
All renters are bots anyway. Who gives a shit?
---
So, basically bringing back some level of the gun-mining from classic drones. Personally, not opposed.
---
*Not like this...*
---
LORDE are like an angry equally bad Blades of Grass, just minus the values thing.
---
Possible. What the posters up the thread want is for the ratting and mining anoms to be limited in quantity per region, and respawn in a different system inside the same region. This is how wormhole anomalies work, and how naturally spawning nullsec ratting anomalies (read: not IHUB spawned) work.
---
Curious to see what people think a Bomber lobbing that thing is equivalent to...
---
Stainguy is half of the sub now y kill him unless you gun for the entire sub
---
I don't see how that would be better, the large groups that control lots of space will still have huge economic advantage over those who don't.
---
Before tiericide, the taranis was a really hot frigate fighter, with the right fit, the dual prop taranis could put out about 300 dps and control range on anything that didn't fit AB + web and even then with null, it would still come out on top of dps wars. Tank usually consisted of a dcu since it had almost all its hp in hull.
---
I flew dual prop taranis a lot and I sure wasn't the only one it was a blast.
---
???
---
I wish they would bring back the posters and etc they had years ago. I was able to snag a few of them but not all the ones I wanted. 
---
&gt; The current path actually brings us closer to Serenity. Because it provides the coalition with the largest capital umbrella with further exponential growth unlike any smaller coalition.
---
The key is that growth is within one region.  Leaving other regions for others to grow in.  Yes, roams to Delve are suicide missions, but that's restricted to Delve.
---
&gt; A few months ago I posted a middle ground solution to this problem.
---
The flaw in your thesis is the assumption that coalitions will continue to use all of the space they currently own, and then move on when it gets stripped bare.
---
CCP has made moving a pain in the ass once you've built up that much infrastructure.  So you're not going to get the pseudo-nomadic situation you seem to be aiming for.  Instead, the big guys would go grab neighboring regions and rotate their krabbing through these regions, using infrastructure that is left there while the region is "fallow".  Resulting in more-or-less the same result as the proposal above. 
---
 You just used a lot more words.
---
&gt; Make ratting/mining anoms respawn like scannable sites/wormhole anoms and you will fix a lot of problems overnight.
---
This would definitely do something, but I'm not sure it would do as much as you think.  As far as I can tell, wormhole anoms respawn just as fast as the upgrade kspace ones... the only difference is that they respawn *somewhere else in the region*.  The randomization would definitely force people to move around a bit, but it would, essentially, require you to hold a whole region, and then the carrying capacity of the region would increase proportional to the mean of the activity across the entire region.  This is, of course, assuming that each system where the anomalies were upgraded the way they are now contributes to the region cap on total anomalies.
---
On the other hand, it does look like even the goons only use about 2/3 of Delve for ratting, currently.  (However, on further investigation, this turns out to be NPC Delve, a couple of systems next to NPC Delve, and a couple systems next to Period Basis, which is to say, the border zones.)
---
It's one of those paper vs in game things, the extra speed, agility and sig bonus really does help when approaching and trying to get under cruiser guns. An Enyo will occasionally take an unlucko volley in the face from a shield BC, a Taranis never will. Not that it matters when every anti-support ship uses fucking rapid lights but still.
---
Would suggest giving them a whirl and see for yourself, Inty V is never a wasted train. 
---
And regardless of any changes Goons will just adapt to them while r/eve continues to whine about how unfair it is. 
---
&gt;ilimited
---
I would have thought the first one was a typo if you hadn't done it twice. Not sure if English is a second language for you, but that isn't a word. 
---
That mantra won't help Goons if the changes actually require skill to PvP or project force. But luckily for you, I think you guys are safe there with the CSM and CPP as they currently stand.
---
That's a good question because I can tell you for a fact that it isn't going to the enrichment of line members in horde. 
---
The game isn't engineered for massive 5000 player subcap fights either, the game engine doesn't care if its a titan or a frigate (Apart from the darn titan death AOE damage that is a PITA on server performance). 
---
So while you say the game isn't "balanced" for supercapital battles what I think you mean is that the game isn't ***engineered*** for 5000 player battles. 
---
We should be looking into how to make design changes that reduce server load. instead of trying to think of ways of reducing capital proliferation, because if I didn't have a titan pilot (80bn+ injection cost) and two faxes (40bn+ each to inject) then I'd have 10 clients in the X47 battles instead of 3 clients. Would that have helped server performance? No. 
---
Battleships should have just 1 gun and no active tank or prop module ability, but they should have a warp speed bonus so groups can bring them instead of fucktons of ECM burst frigates to every supercapital fight. And dreads should have a built-in cap recharge bonus so they don't have tons of cap charges cycling, and capitals and ships in general should be redesigned so that they need fewer active modules. Carriers should have 1 fighter wing not 3, supers 2 fighter wings not 5. The AOE death effect should be removed from titans ofc (Don't know if its still there, think its just made very small maybe?). The crimewatch thing should be removed as soon as tidi happens. The tether check should be less often (we could see it in the outstanding calls window all the time during the fights), and all the other periodic calls you saw in the outstanding server call list should be changed so that they take place less frequently (like the sov status check which happened every 10 seconds or whatever until CCP finally turned it down to like 60 seconds or something). 
---
If you think it takes hundreds of hours of lame time-expenditure then obviously for you its very difficult to do it. Me on the other hand, I sit here updating orders and build orders while listening to music, listening on comms and chatting on jabber, having a wonderful time. 
---
That seems pretty basic. Double check your registration data and make sure you aren't missing some characters on your data or maybe mixed up the two. 
---
No, it's made. I curl the top sheet and put a little folded quilt on top for my cat to sit on when I am going over the latest Sci Show videos or telling her about eve stuff. 
---
It's fine to not be a fan of us... not fine to be racist. Do you have any screen grabs or chat logs + usernames from this? Shoot me a DM.
---
Some people do it, but it's normally better to have your ship set up for one thing. You can always carry a depot and refit.

The only thing missing in this video
---
Mom walks in: Jeffery make your fucking bed or I'm taking your xbox. 
---
Definitely could use another look then i think. Cus after looking at the stats the Tyranis right now trades nullification for more dps and slightly more health. But nullification is a really strong thing to have.
---
Do I really look like a "Jeffrey" to you? Do I look like a console gamer? 
---
Yeah, that's what I'm going to do. It's so annoying though that we have to go through this workaround to basically get a structure your account has access to.
---
I enjoyed the part where Xenuria tried to articulate how Gobbins was a dictator but did a better job describing the Mittani.
---
Good guy Tri anchors an objective for us to fight over, much appreciated! GF Snuff &lt;3

Goddamn it. And goddamn you for reminding me. 
---
you picked the one and only hour where no-one came on, said hello, then said absolutely nothing else for the rest of the day. When did you record this? EUTZ prime?
---
You can obtain this from the only remaining static 10/10 DED site in the game, Contested Kois City, located in G5ED-Y in Vale. It's currently owned by NC, I wouldn't be surprised if people are farming it still.
---
1 year? Shit man, you plan further ahead than we do!
---
Right, CCP has ALWAYS claimed its OUR fault.
---
no, I get the point, the thing is that there are so few isk places to spend isk and so much isk is generated by turbokrabs that there are really not many places for it to go other than titans. You yourself couldn't come up with one solid example of side activity that would take that isk. 
---
They actually see that as an advantage. By their logic, forcing us to take more space will reduce the power of our supercap umbrella, theoretically allowing them to get dank frags again. 
---
Wow big surprise huh
---
I'm actually sad. I thought it was a scam and got my hopes up but hearing it's legit is a let down.  Lol. 
---
Hi, am new.

Why a venture though? Should‚Äôve given him a catalyst and enough EMP for about 4 volleys 
---
Nerf bastion!

The real answer is that the combat interceptors used to also be interdiction nullified, but that was very strong. CCP nerfed them a little while after the reworked assault frigates, effectively obsoleting combat interceptors. Assault frigates generally do more damage and tank much more. Tackle interceptors are nullified, are generally more agile, and have a bonus to warp disruptor and scrambler range and cap use, making them great light tackle and scouts. Combat interceptors need a rework badly. They don't fit any role that isn't better filled by another ship. Unfortunately they will have to get in line behind T3 destroyers and cruisers, marauders, the Widow, and t1 battleships for reworks.
---
Grr mods, hate mods
---
What a cutie he is.
---
Go back to your tdsin flair idiot 
---
Well if its that fucking boring and everyone seems to think that CCP will never address the issue then why are you still here? This is what I don't understand. If you know in your heart of hearts that the current model of turbo krabbing will never change why stick around to bitch?
---
War surrender and fail cascade are two different things, but I'm assuming you didn't know that. 
---
Oh so it's the whole "we want to spank people without getting spanked back" argument that always seems to crop up around pvp?
---
Then do it already
---
I went back on the LORDE discord and explained why I left, and because someone (presumably Evertrader) kicked me from the discord for explaining, I'll also explain it here. But it's not like anyone cares.
---
* Most of the members of LORDE have a shit taste in memes and are terrible at local banter.
---
* LORDE leadership, specifically Evertrader, like to act like they are something more than they actually are. Sadly, some alliances have to be "pets", and LORDE is one of them. It's okay to be a pet alliance, but it's not okay to act like you're something more. I consider them a pet alliance because most of the fleets I went on in my time in LORDE were coalition (Fraternity) fleets.
---
* Many LORDE members love to act like they're better than the rest, and are very elitist. I can understand being elitist if you're actually a powerful alliance, but LORDE is not. I was given shit while I was in the alliance for pointing out how other alliances were successful, and was shot down saying that LORDE was better than them for some reason, despite the fact that I was trying to suggest ways that we could become more successful.
---
Due to this, I just didn't feel at home in the alliance, so I left. However, seeing the way that they act from a different (out of alliance) perspective, I'm really glad that I left.
---
Because we all know this is EvE mine until you drop Online.
---
Whys that?
---
yeah the title is misleading, everyone who was on grid was there to shoot the TRI fort, we just also were shooting at each other after/during we finished killing it.
---
It's purpose wasn't to just for CCP to give you stuff, it was to get people to log in on the holidays. Sadly of you missed out then it means that CCP missed out too
---
Because I thought the scammers were now using the new player friendly mail as a new scam. I guess I just like watching the world burn. Lol. 
---
The nerf to interdiction nullification knocked the combat interceptors out of use, when there were clear alternatives that would have left them still somewhat useful as some form of heavy tackle frigate or combat ship.
---
Still one of the more irritating nerfs I've seen, along with nuking the Griffin navy and doing nothing about it.
---
This is why we need Ronald Regan and his wife for the next CSM.   
---
JUST SAY NO!   
---
Nobody special, Gobbins is in trouble. 
---
&gt; anom respawn methods were changed to be like WHs - i.e., when a site is run, it respawns in some system in the same region after a delay.
---
I covered this elsewhere, but, to be specific, this is not how it works *at all* in wormholes.  The really dedicated krabbers in jspace have alpha clones seeded into most of the other systems in the region of their bear hole to warp to anomalies that aren't in their bear hole right now and start the despawn timer ticking so that they get a reroll on what system the anomalies spawn in.  If you can just jump drive to their new location that has accumulated the most anomalies in your carrier, this is an increase in operating overhead but not a significant brake on running as many anomalies as you want.
---
Your assumptions were enjoyable to read. Please forward me Horde's balance sheet so I can make accusations of my own.
---
Disclaimer: Talking out ass with no supporting numbers on hand just going off my experience.
---
Both used to be immune. You had one speed demon and one that could kinda fight. The faster ones are the ones with bubble immunity now.
---
What was happening though is that you ended up with entire fleets of Claws, the "combat" Minmatar ceptor, as a rapid response / Sov warfare doctrine. It had/has two bonuses to its damage setting it apart from all the others. 
---
Rather than put thought into it, they removed the bubble Immunity of these "combat" ceptors as a countermeasure, theoretically you get a more capable combat ship that still outpaces most other ships, at the sacrifice of immunity. In reality that jobs already largely filled by Assault Frigates and T3 destroyers. So they're now useless.
---
At least it stopped whole interceptor doctr- wait no, now it's just shifted to Maledictions.
---
Didn't they change it because alliances held massive amounts of space and smaller alliances couldn't get a decent place to live? Also, they came up with system upgrades so that corps could turtle up in a single system or pocket. 
---
No hate, just pointing out how shit you are.
---
Tell TheBluey and Gideon that they are doing a good job, also tell them don't go into dead ends in Detroid.
---
The Mittani is an Autocrat and the figure-head of a Meritocratic Autocracy.  Gobbins is a dictator that can't even make the trains run on time much less lead an alliance of new players. 
---
oh are you still on about this 
---
Importantly you don't get the sites you want even if every system has active ratters. Wanna run Havens? Hopefully by the time you finish running all the ones in your system more spawn in. Otherwise Havens will build up in a system where whoever is in there isn't running them. That's what happens in wspace. Sites often build up in empty or shattered WHs because no one is running them. 
---
Sure, it's possible that by running constantly in every system people could make it so sites are always available, but I think that is unlikely even in delve. 
---
Cringe or not, everything I have said has come true. 
---
I bitch at Nightblade cause he promises us all a glorious death on every roam, and most of the time I somehow end up getting back with my ship intact.  
---
Leaving Fade was a mistake
---
It used to work, but it's possible I set an expiry and then forgot.
---
The bigger issue is that I get this error over and over, so I never get to the point where I could edit my registration data in EVE IPH.  I'm not sure if the retrieval failure prevents the rest of the application from loading (maybe I'm being impatient because there's a dialog box) but it seems to get stuck there.
---
A little history lesson, immunity to nontargeted interdiction is (in my eyes) a new feature for interceptors.
---
But wouldn't the fact that everything in the game is player driven cause this argument to be invalid? If the majority of the players have turned their focus onto a new type of content i.e. mining and ratting vs. pvping that's the new norm right? And I am not trying to troll or pick a fight I am just saying that since this game is player driven mob mentality rules and that mentality is to turbo krab so everyone that wants a super cap can have one.
---
Yep. They're completely blind to the ramifications of what they ask beyond what they think it'll do to enable the risk-free molasses submarine jousting they want.
---

Yeah I warned people months ago and made a thread where people said they didn't care. That thread along with this one is going to age really well in the next few months. I am like a /r/eve cheese and wine connoisseur in that I bait a bunch of people into saying shit that will be hilariously rich given time.  
---
I'm pretty sure that Amarr has more than 10% of Jita's trade value.
---
sure, sounds like a great idea. I'm sure the modelers/skinners/etc pretty much everyone who works on new content rather than bug-fixing (they are two different skill sets) will love being put on furlough for months at a time while the bug-fixing team does exactly what they are doing already with "maybe" some temp workers brought on to marginally increase speeds... its a good plan. the best.
---
Great, I'm happy it's so easy for you. However, I meant what I said, not what you thought I said. The designers themselves assumed titans would be scarce. They intended building a titan to be a corp activity and result in a powerful capital ship. They did not intend for them to be common. We know this because they said so. As for the other changes you mentioned, those are fine for one playstyle - huge, infrequent slugfests - but do nothing to fix the playstyles, namely roaming and small gang, that have been crushed by boson titans dropping with absolute safety under supercap umbrellas to wipe out t1 cruiser gangs just for the kicks. I'm sure some people will read that as whining, but the fact remains that most groups have stopped roaming altogether. It's just not worth it when anything you catch and any fight you get has a high chance or turning into subcaps vs. supercaps
---
We're going to need to construct additional pylons because that just leveled everything.
---
I wouldn't know it appears to have happened while i was on hiatus working on my wow mythic raiding.
---
At this point removing StainGuy would most likely cause the subreddit to collapse, the only way to make him disappear without unpredictable consequences is to give him what he wants, a lowsec gate to Stain. 
---
I'm ashamed were being compared to them. I mean I know we're shit, but I didn't think we let the bar drop that low :(
---
And did Goons have that supercap umbrella when they first started out?
---
&gt; Sites often build up in empty or shattered WHs because no one is running them.
---
Yes, and the thorough people have alphas in all the systems in their krab region to start the despawn timers on sites for a reroll every couple days.
---
In kspace, you don't even have that problem: this handy thing called a jump drive lets you take your carrier to whatever system accumulated the most haven respawns after your current system runs out.
---
Take my upvote
---
Motion denied.
---
It wouldn't even work very well for that, since most regions aren't more than 10-20 LY across anyway, and super staging is usually in a conveniently central point.
---
Im actually curious how this compares to the visuals used for OB's in dust. What would the initial damage from the bomb look like in terms of size to an infantryman. 
---
I have a hard time believing any sentient human being would willingly subject themselves to a tidifest. Maybe that's why wormholers are so much better...
---
Sure but what's the goal, then? As more and more people accrue lots of wealth and supercap numbers grow, people will get bored. Great, you got your nyx. Maybe you got two, and a titan. Now what? Major wars are more scarce now because server load is too high with mega blobfests. Citadel mechanics are terrible. Roaming as a playstyle is dead, meaning not only is it harder for you to seek that content out, there is less content showing up on your doorstep. 
---
Without a cycle of production and destruction the game becomes a wealth accrual simulator. Some may find that fun, but I doubt many will stay long term as once elusive goals like owning a titan become the common, natural progression of the game.
---
Eve has no end game. There are no raids. There are no heroics or dailies (yet...they're kinda here). The content is all driven by players shooting players - even if you solely PvP, you need people who lose ships to buy your products. Without easy and frequent PvP, Eve will become very stale.
---
Yes. The largest group of capitals willing to live in the same region and create a krabbing empire. North had more capitals, but they were not interested in that kind of gameplay.
---
Besides, the answer to your question doesn't matter. If the situation is game breaking now, it doesn't matter if Goons achieved that game breaking status with a fully deserved manner with outstanding strategic prowess. Doesn't make it less game breaking.
---
Voting for Vince Draken was a mistake. 
---
just stop 
---
You're stopping after you drop? Pffft, casual!
---
Thx for answering at the very least
---
I know, I have alphas in my bear hole's region too. If nullsec bears had to jump from system to system to chase sites, that would necessarily put them at risk, increasing PvP opportunities, and drop the number of people a single system could support, meaning alliances had to spread out or lose production.
---
I mean, if everyone on this sub wasn't such a glue sniffer I wouldn't have to call them out on being biological waste so often. I'm toxic, but only to the genome pollution that deserves it.

I heard there was a corporation out there pretty much dedicated exactly to what your post describes.  Their name was CodeSpan Delivery Network or WingCODE Delivery something.  Wingspan, maybe?  Anywho, those guys can deliver... and how!

Eh; I doubt it.
---
In any event, it would make "1 region" the optimal territory size for an alliance, because then you can cover the entire spawn zone for your anomalies, which would make life harder for groups which can't handle that, while not significantly making life harder for groups which can.  For all its faults, the current system is designed to make "1 constellation" the de facto minimum unit of sovholding, and this would nerf that.  (Not to mention it would once again privilege carrier ratting over subcap ratting because moving to from system to system to chase sites wouldn't even require gate jumps by the ratting ship.)
---
