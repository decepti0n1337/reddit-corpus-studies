the sum average of what everyone wants is bland grey mush that appeals to no one. Food companies realized this decades ago and offer a range of very similar but slightly different products as a result.  For some reason in gaming tho companies think the best solution is to try and make a single game that appeals to everyone at once.

---
F.  Can’t wait to hear your next story, keep on flying!
---
&gt; I did everything perfectly
---

---
I don't think you did. I edited my post with more details I think you could improve.
---
It's not hate when calling out cancer to be eradicated when you see it clear as day. 
---
 It's called saving a game, and community from something that could/would kill it. Your devil's advocate attitude to this possible exploit only suggests you want it to be a thing. So you can exploit it, and corrupt the market , etc,etc.  
---
Better be careful when assuming a comment it filled with hate. It could be that you are filled with hate, and you jump at any opportunities to place on someone else to deflect your own brains inconsistencies.
---
&gt; was like fighting NC/PL before their subcap skills atrophied into oblivion. They had seemingly perfect line-pilot discipline, 
---
Nice troll
---
less people were logged in when i started playing and it was fucking GREAT
---
The only thing new players experience in the first 15 minutes of the game is the NPE.  By your own account, that's when they quit.
---
Adding another "EVE is fun" promise on top of the big battles and other stuff just isn't going to help.
---
I was about to bank it but as I said I found more relic sites on my way home and thinking Esoteria is relatively safe and considering I hadn't seen anyone in hours as well as that Dcan was showing no results I was pretty confident I would get out safely.. Guess not
---
So injectors was somehow introduced for our sake? Rorqs werent vehemently argued against by NS? Cynos is for us?
---
Thats BS and it keeps getting repeated until its somehow the truth. And considering the last six months have been straight nerfs not to mention the other nerfs these last years which indeed will amount to more nerfs than buffs but still, "pulls back a little". 
---
If you wanna run with a narrative, thats fine. But atleast be somewhat honest about it. The last 2 changes have been massive and they come on top of a shitload of other nerfs. This is the objective truth. Dont sit there and straight up lie with "few years into the game till today".
---
And if Im not mistaken, everybody could have joined the meta. It wasnt purely for us. You are speaking as if CCP somehow came to us and said "here you go guys", fk the rest. Thats rewriting history.
---
Here we call it Mindflood
---
You definitely did not do everything perfectly. But you're a perfect fit for dreddit :))))
---
Blops is definitely more alive with the changes, it's a lot less aids to hunt under bloc umbrellas now that having blue-eyes cyno5 alts and/or 40 afk cloaky campers isn't mandatory for catching anyone who reads local.
---
Well said friend.
---
Haha. Someone from your alliance just shit on me big time. I hope there won't be a next story soon otherwise I will go bankrupt. Literally..
---
there was never ever anything special about NC./PL subcap skills
---
it was 99% showing up at the right time in the right place with the right comp; all FC and intel prep, nothing to do with the line members
---
the average PL and TEST fleet on an individual level were never that different
---
I won't take offense because everyone here seems to have been playing for over 10 years where as I have been playing for ~3 months
---
So if a ship stays cloaked for too long it becomes combat probe-able?
---
... More than messing up life for the cloaky campers, that sort of thing would mess up life for anyone who tries to leave grid and cloak at a safe. Since covops can still warp while cloaked, they could just start bouncing off of planets when they see combats, and since you don't have DScan to find them you're basically just throwing completely blind combat probes around hoping the target stays still for a while and that the lock you got on them wasn't while they were still in warp.
---
This is devastating for my alt camping corp and would make more sense why it seems magically people know I'm active after being logged off for a day+
---
Welcome to eve, I hope to read more stories about your adventures cris.
---
What kind of answer do you expect? You argue with some not further specified "data" you have against someone who is actively on these fleets almost every day.  
---
  
---
And this degoratory talk about "PvPers" looks like you're not even in one of the supers that fail at aiming, you're sitting in one of the Rorqs they try to defend. So to say it the words of some certain high sec plebs: calm down miner.  
---
P.S. this whole game is PvP in one way or another, even station trading, ratting or mining are in their very own ways.
---
For one, rorqs have been argued against by NS from the start. Dont put the same shit CCP is pulling today, i.e., disregarding player input, on us. We argued against it, we still argue against it.
---
Also, they werent left unchecked, they got nerfed like 3 times during the period you argue "went unchecked" so Im not really sure you were even playing then.
---
But all of this is besides the point. Why are you even arguing about these things if youre not playing anymore?
---
i feel  the loss...but it happens  from time to time and its hard to avoid it. not always prey can escape from hunter..next time  hack cans  being 2300m away  if some1 warps in you can just cloak andmove away/warpout...  all know looting range is 2500m   and decloak range 2000 so stay  around 2200  and when it happens  u can easily get away
---
If I get blown up again with while being on the wrong clone I will just retire from EVE 😂. I won't even have money to buy a new Astero
---
No one is trying to offend you. You're just ignorant in thinking you were playing "perfectly" yet lost an astero full of loot to a t3c and also a training pod. There's multiple things wrong with each of those, that "perfect" play would have kept you safe.
---
But instead you're keen to say you did everything right and argue with people that know better. Hence why I said you're a perfect fit in Dreddit and TAPI
---
I wish you a good farewell, sir.
---
Remove cloak from the game.
---
I wish you a good luck and many good times.
---
Well I said perfect as far as what I could've done after this guy appeared on my overview and how quick I reacted.
---
/u/Cycloidal_Medication,
---
Aneu and I never had a conversation to being with let alone an argument.
---
I think youre missing the point that you need a subcap response. There are options that dont require booshing to counter them but the issue is that you cant manage to get fleets together that fast when there is no guarantee you can actually catch anything.
---
It really shouldnt come as a surprise that PvPers are the most risk averse group in this game. They bail as soon as any trouble comes their way.
---
this.
---
stukas/booshcomps are only op because they are the only doctrine somewhat able to stay on supberblob grids. or are somewhat able to avoid mass fighterblobs.
---
nerf super application to subcaps, lets say cruisers and below and all of a sudden there are other fleets out and about.
---
2200 So I can open them easily? I usually do It at 1000 because I have an anti scramble fit so I didn't think I could get caught.
---
Probably the latter. The former might require watching the screen and looking for a change in the image indicating a gate flash (or monitoring the sound for one), while the latter is just as simple as waiting for a single line from a log.
---
Thanks
---
down-voted, because CCP FIX style be like "delete in-game log" (and they then no care about it can be catch with packet sniffer or so)
---
And yet you're still objectively wrong. But ok dude.
---
You're arguing with folks trying to help you avoid this happening again, after you specifically asked for advice, when you've acknowledged you're a new player talking to vets.
---
You had 4 warpstabs so I think we can assume there is no way this guy had you tackled. Looks to me like he decloaked next to you and simply blew you up before you could warp out. Maybe your ship bounced into the can you were hacking when you tried to warp to a random direction.
---
It's boot.ini all over again.
---
I'm not saying I'm right. I said in the post I'm OPEN to advice exactly because I know I'm inexperienced. I just applied all my knowledge without hesitation. I didn't know I could get destroyed so quickly..
---
I'm not arguing I'm just saying..
---
If we're just now noticing they've been using it for how ever long it's been an issue
---
I keep hearing this but nobody can really tell me any changes except for the Rorq. I do however know its been straight nerfs for six months and I know of plenty other nerfs the last years. So saying something has happened for 3 years isnt the truth. Did something happen 3 years ago? Sure, but the list of nerfs is much much bigger than the buffs.
---
And may I ask something? You dont think the thing that favors bloc playstyle is PvPers? That people straight up hunt everyone thats somewhat weak? That isnt why people join blocs?
---
"I did everything perfect" does not mean "I'm open to advice"
---
A deployment that so far has been toasting space and bashing uncontested structures, the two most boring things to do in eve. Shouldn't come as a surprise people don't go on the fleets
---
Calling people botters dosent make them botters retard.
---
The actual funny thing is how late this leak is, considering this deployment is now a success because they killed some goonie caps
---
I didn't see it bounce but yes he didn't have me tackled. That's why I wasn't afraid at first, I just thought I could escape anyone. Guess he had been camping there.
---
Which is why capitals are dropped.
---
okay I should've said I did everything I knew/had been taught perfect.
---
Do you not see the tag?
---
[https://youtu.be/L8zT5c83TtA](https://youtu.be/L8zT5c83TtA)
---
Lol. Ok kid. Now I'm wondering if I'm getting trolled or if you're just hopeless.
---
Wow this is big. Wonder how long this has been an issue and we had no idea
---
Please let the door hit your arse on the way out... Cheers...
---
Show me on zkill how your fleets get wiped due to the mechanics you argue are counters.
---
Like a said, bitch moves PvPers like to pull, like straight talking out of their ass.
---
Only a moron deals in absolutes.
---
Yeah it should be closer to 71 dudes at 70mil each.
---
Yes I'm wondering the same thing. I said I didn't mean to be rude or disapproving of the other guy's comments. It's about how you read my previous comments.
---
dont worry you'll feel worse once you self destruct your high grades.
---
A cloaked ship can't hurt you though?
---
you used to be able to do it with n00b missions as well when they were dynamic and could be initiated in any system you were in. I got many deep safe's doing that 30+ au from any celestial or gate. you'd just restart it until you got the ones you wanted.
---
and perfect info that helps bots 100x more than actual players
---
well you're being taught by tapi so no surprise its bad
---
FFS why are people downvoting this simple and reasonable question?
---
what's tapi
---
&gt; Recons simply don’t have the staying power to be able to last more than a few seconds before being alpha’d off the grid.
---
While this is true, I've seen a lot of groups use interceptors for in cynos for this and it wasn't a problem. I'd be game for them doing something like removing cynos from overview if you're off-grid, then people could bring caps in somewhere off grid and warp in, or even make them no longer warpable objects, and just cyno in outside of your enemy fleets DPS range.
---
No one taught you to spam warp as soon as you know you're going to lose the ship? There's no reason your pod should have died. He had enough time to wait out decloak delay, lock you with a *cruiser*, kill your max coward fit astero (which means he would have had to use two faction scrams, or you didn't actually warp out), and then lock your pod with said *cruiser* and kill it.
---
No one taught you to spam warp as your ship is about to die? No excuse to lose that pod
---
don't worry about it my man
---
proud member of tapirium of the galaxy
---
Clearly 10 man jackdaw gangs toasting space and not contesting
---
So, there is only one person and his army of thousands of alts who disagrees with you? is that what you think?
---
Hey man! Yeah, i've taken some breaks before and I will do so again it seems. If I make it back or not remains to be seen. 
---
I'm happy you waffle guys like the WHs, I tried it once and it wasn't for me. Maybe some other time I can try it though, who knows.
---
If test wanted to feed I can just start gating titans around
---
All of that was to cater to the ease of living in null, yes. Should we go back to pre cyno logistic convoy fleets? Hell no. But don't beat around the bush and think for a second that until recently, that the vast majority of changes from then till now weren't for nullblocs. Last 6 months vs. over 15 years. The nerfbat always eventually comes back to you. Its just your time now.
---
dumb question, where is this logger tool?
---
WOW and risk adverse deciding to bail, yes.
---
A Loki should never be able to kill your pod barring extreme lag situations.
---
Hahaha. At this stage, why not.
---
I didn't ever warp out, I only tried to - he decloaked and insta killed me and soon after the pod.
---
He isn't the autist we deserve...he is the autist we have
---
Can confirm comrade.
---
See, this is where you're wrong again. You had time to warp out with both, and ESPECIALLY the pod. Pods insta warp, if you hit it, you would have been out.
---
What should I have done, I'm new to the game
---
:pray:
---
*bee points to the ratting income*
---
I didn't know pods could do that
---
don't stop spamming warp so you can try and get it the first tick your ship is dead. pods are instawarp sub 1s align so there is nothing in the game that can lock them and point them in that time only interdiction can hold a pod against its will.
---
mid terms is just a hectic week or two where you might spend 150 extra hours on school work than normal.
---
[removed]
---
Ohh the commentator? You think that is worth anything? Hell I got interviewed by the old Eve magazine, you don’t see me throwing that shit around do you? Temper your ego, it’s unbecoming of you.
---
Usually high mobility in games comes at a steep steep cost. Like, a Mutalisk loses badly to 2 marines, has less range than 2 marines, and costs over twice as much due to gas generally being more valuable than minerals.
---
The combination of high range and high speed is usually one of the most expensive combinations, because once you get a critical mass they are extremely difficult to counter.
---
Proud to fly with these absolute bob damn lunatics.
---
Idk where you got that from
---
That sounds like your agree, not disagree
---
What made you think I was disagreeing with his point in the first place?
---
Where else could I vent about scumbag Hilmar further ruining EVE?
---
I didn't know about that, I just thought once your big ship is dead the little capsule is helpless you know? It makes sense no?
---
Exactly, because you're in an alliance led by retards who are trying to copy goons but do a worse job of it. They recruit anyone with a pulse and hope they figure it out. He also never had you tackled you said, but you still got deleted. You did a ton of shit wrong, which is okay. It's not smart to argue with people when you're clueless.
---
they don't get wiped out. but not because it's not possible, which was literally my point throughout this whole damn argument. like, do you even know what a fucking burst projector does?
---
I got my own drug. Its called fun
---
Okay, sport. Go play in your tiny pond.
---
Happens to us all dude, especially when we're learning this game. If i can offer a wee bit of advice when doing relic/data sites, set your default orbit to 4.5k. This puts you within safe range to crack the can, but also far enough away to cloak. Keep your prop mod off and if something appears on your overview, immediately hit cloak - this will give you a few extra seconds to warp out. 
---
fly safe
---
Some people in our area (Waffles) live in whs but for the majority of us we aren’t into the whole deployment thing. We’ve tried it and with our smaller numbers now it just wouldn’t work. 
---
We used to get good engagements in provi in our TZ but it’s turned into a stalemate so to speak. One side forms and other stands down or other 3rd parties come. To me it’s changed from what it was and I think it’s just been culminating up to this point. 
---
As far as blops, yeah that’s too much effort for any pay off basically the last 3 years unless you use blue eye.
---
My attitude is that CCP should sort it’s shit out and make sure this wasn’t possible rather than toxic numpties like you start “REEEEEEEEEEING” all over the place about other players and calling people cancer.
---
Honestly I’ve been training my hauler alt on this account anyway. Nothing else I need that I don’t have an alt for.
---
your little capsule is helpless, but it's so small and light that its very fast to get into warp and run away.
---
Oh, well I might be clueless but at least I'm not an arrogant asshole just like you are being right now?
---
For me, it’s the people.
---
Okay, lesson learned. Thanks
---
/u/Nimos is the best
---
Update:
---
I logged a char into TQ inside of a wh citadel, while my alt is at a planet and got this:
---
23:53:55    blue::BlueResFileSystemLocal    info    Opening cache:/Pictures/Characters/Chat/21/1064796021_32.jpg (C:/Users/Person/AppData/Local/CCP/EVE/c_programfiles(x86)_eve_sharedcache_tq_tranquility/cache/Pictures/Characters/Chat/21/1064796021_32.jpg)
---
1064796021_32.jpg
---
1064796021 corresponds to the character that was logged in.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/1064796021/
---
tl;dr: The logs show you when a character is logged in and out to the system that you're in, regardless of where you are.
---
Great advice thanks. Any reason it would be 4.5km instead of 2.2/3 km?
---
fuck
---
Interceptors won’t be able to use cynos. Cynoing off grid is an option but once again, once a fleet is on field, jumping to it is already a risk with possibilities of crashing and whatnot without having to warp on grid with high lag/load. It’s a terrible change for big fights.
---
&lt;3
---
I can’t believe you just used your tag to somehow justify your ridiculous opinion. This is comedy gold.
---
please let us set the top color amount arbitrarily, if you compare everything to jita as the high point every area will look dim as hell and the feature will be useless
---
i find the wider orbit mitigates chances of bumping when you try to warp
---
At the end of the day this is pretty much all we can do. 
---
But honestly, this is our fault. We let them nerf us for a long long time since we thought that certain things were OP and should be nerfed. So we didnt ree enough and this made CCP think it was okey for them to go all in. In hindsight we should have fought them every step of the way.
---
And now theyre stuck between a rock and a hard place and no matter what they do they will lose face. I dont envy them right now, I doubt they ever imagined the backlash being this severe. They just thought that we would accept more shit just like weve done for the past year/years.
---
Can you explain how bumping works?
---
Yup, I've had this happen in my clients when multiboxing.
---
I'll be Cloaking as one warps away and then the cloaked one will be showing live on the overview from anywhere in system as if I was on grid.
---
I'm not onboard with this one amigo. I don't see bombers as OP. I see dropping 200+ on someone through a covert cyno as being the OP part.
---
Ya'll think this is a joke, but this is a recruitment thread.
---
in this context it's when you are trying to align prior to warp and hit into structures (cans) in space, breaking your alignment. as your ship tries to realign it can just keep bumping making a 3 second warp initiation a 10 second dance of hell
---
&gt; **players is down -5,910 players** 
---
Accounts not players, I do assume a high percentage are bots honestly. But meh EVE is dying.
---
And CSM tags are "just for show" too right?
---
Oh, well that's a stupid mechanic but I guess I will have to deal with it.
---
Yep 100% successful deployment vs legacy...... killing a goon welp roam
---
Holy fuck the irony.
---
So its theoretical? Not practical. Do you have a learning disability or something? Do I need to explain basic shit to you? 
---
If something can happen in theory but it seldom manifests itself in reality then its just a theoretical concept that gets disproven by reality, i.e., its not real due to certain events that arent included in the theoretical approach. 
---
Which is why I say, its theoretical, not practical.
---
I feel dumber for having explained this. Feels like every adult should know the difference between these two. And that they would argue about it since they themselves are saying it.
---
Closest moon or structure they are near seems like the best we can get.
---
Works fine what I need. I am sure they will build it out more.
---
I will with a alt in my own system if I'm board.
---
I have my alt in D-P - i do data/relics with him sometimes still, i'll message you in game and we can go a run some time. I'll show you some of the other tricks i've learned having been blown up numerous times learning :)
---
very good komred )))))))
---
&gt;More than messing up life for the cloaky campers, that sort of thing would mess up life for anyone who tries to leave grid and cloak at a safe. 
---
Well yeah, that's the point. You can't both remove cloaky camping and also let people afk cloaked in the system. I don't think that 'quality of life of people who need to go afk' should take precedence over balance of a gamebreaking gameplay style that literally shuts down entire regions without much effort.     
---
Yes, it doesn't guarantee a catch on someone camping you cloaked, but I'm of the opinion that bouncing planets while cloaked isn't exactly afk activity either.
---
&gt; Interceptors won’t be able to use cynos.
---
I understand that, but they do it now is my point, and they have way less EHP than a recon.
---
I don't see any Irony really. I may have worded 1 comment bad and you supposedly know way more than me but instead of coming and here and explaining to me like a normal person you called my alliance shit and everyone in it retarded as well as insulted me quite a few times although I said I'm not taking offense and I didn't really respond to your arrogance.
---
Funny how you're posting this as if they're doing nothing. Can't wait for goons to deploy their SIGs down to help you guys ;)
---
Pilgrim
---
Ok great stuff. Would be happy to go for a run :)
---
You've responded *every* time dumby. Like I said, you're perfect for tapi
---
You’re going to push this ego fuelled bullshit even more? You need to calm down. You commentated on ships fighting, well done, now sit the hell down because it doesn’t make you an expert on game design nor does it give you the right to dictate to others how they play their game.
---
I mean. Sorry. And you can downvote as much as you like. But if you think 22,000 accounts being banned this year isn't have an effect on the PCU, you're so salty it's made you retarded. Sorry bruhs.
---
I've met him a few times at meetups. I believe he used to be a member of WHBOO. /u/exookiz would know
---
Wow classic launched last week.  Its at least accounted for my 2 accounts not logging in this week.  It will stabalize once I get bored of WoW.  Ive been playing this game forever but dont mind a break when something new comes along.
---
Would be more fun than fighting fortress dronelands, not being able to jump in caps and always outformed in HACs
---
eRa Of cHaOs
---
Ctrl+alt+shift+m
---
Then log viewer
---
I can also play this game offline waiting for discord pings.
---
There’s a huge difference, interceptors need to get one ship through that has a cyno on it, which can light said cyno and be a safe bridge for the entire fleet to jump to without it dying, that is no longer an option as there are no caps with a cyno ability.
---
ty
---
Da komred
---
Mama dom
---
Same with caps. I thought the objective here was to save rorquals? All you need to do is control the grid and extract.
---
Punishing the attacking force is a whole other beast
---
Thats my issue, i dont really like people lol
---
Uh... sure? I think some of your premises are incorrect, but a "guaranteed" (more than at present) fight is usually what I'm arguing for, so I'm probably not going to object to moves in that direction.
---
Brilliant!
---
Yeah, because they shell out tons of money to just fly any dumbfuck out to Iceland. You have zero clue what you are talking about, good day.
---
New meta will be 4 supers and a titan ratting together per squadron. All tank fit with a smart bomb, link and burst in the highs and each super with 2 remote reps as well.
---
Youre a dipshit.
---
Basil Vulpine went from botting in Blades "our values make us different" of Grass, to Frat? What a scumbag.
---
Just curious, what you did not have trained so free SPs allowed solo pvp?
---
&gt;2200 So I can open them easily? I usually do It at 1000 because I have an anti scramble fit so I didn't think I could get caught.
---
some People do fit 5 points though, and would still be able to get you (faction scram)
---
Real talk: offensive deployments are fucking gay, you will get  dogpiled by hostiles because they can call in reinforcements from 5 regions away in  super mobile hac fleet, spodbless ansiblexes( which take 26min to ref mostly on fort grids and then get reffed for max a day LMAO).   
---
The days of committing a battleship fleet are over.  
---
All the medium nullsec alliances died and only blocs are left.  
---
Nerf hac range, make flex structures killable in less than 20min.
---
Yes, but I assume that's pretty rare given the circumstances?
---
Oh lets go back decades ye dude. You just went back to the start of the game to explain why changes today are okey. What are you, my wife? You gonna bring up old shit and somehow justify todays actions?
---
Stop dude.
---
And the limit was 3 years. In this time its been Rorqs right? Which have been nerfed 4 times since then right? Then what, multiple carrier nerfs, jump fuel consumption, anom spawn timer changes (countless), HAW nerfs and so on. The only real buffs I see since then are jump bridges (which are broken and should be fixed, nobody asked for these, everyone would be content if they were exactly as they used to be), citadels which has improved the QOL of life immensely for all aspects of the game (but NS more than other places) and fatigue changes (which also affects others but NS more).
---
The issue here is that you cant buff anything without NS becoming stronger by it. But that doesnt mean that you can sit there and say that every change is for our benefit. And like I said, everyone could use these things, there werent targeted actions towards any specific playstyles. Its just that a portion of the game didnt want it and got left behind and are now blaming the group that actually followed the meta as being the bad guys.
---
We didnt create the meta, you have an issue take it up with the guys that did. We argued against it and you know it. And we are arguing against these changes aswell. If you are as knowledgeble about the game as you seem to be (far more than me) you should know that siding with CCP will backfire.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
What these "but muh pvp" people dont seem to grasp is that a healthy ecosystem needs a lot more herbivores than carnivores. Petitioning ccp to make rule changes to force the grazers to be more wolflike will just mean a majority of them will seek pasture elsewhere
---
since you seem a bit slow let me explain more detailed: when one super pilot manages to actually aim his neut projector and nuke about half the cap of the whole fleet then it's some scary shit. however it's no crucial threat when it's only that one guy that somehow had a projector fitted and even knew how to use it properly and there is no follow up on it.
---
If there were only like 4-5 supers ina drop of 50ish (so about 10% of them) who can amass the required brain activity for this and they had an FC that can actually plan around it that would pose a serious threat.  
---
that your alliance doesn't teach it's pilots how to use their ships properly (let alone them learning it by themselves), then this isn't an issue in game balancing. just because it doesn't happen doesn't invalidate the fact that theres a possibility for it.
---
Nah, we find a dead end pocket scan all the sigs and watch the entrance. Let them run some sites and kill them once they have some nice loot for us.
---
would have loved to know where these mythical nc supercaps were,   
---
there were dreads and reg caps that moved down, but unless you call the 5 cunts that had supers in lowsec the nc supercap fleet
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I also still don't understand why legacy goes on about that insignificant fight still, even x47's final timer was more exciting
---
I have 4 accounts that - aside from picking up my final reaction runs - I haven't logged in at all. All the changes, coupled with the potential ones, coupled with more RL stresses have killed my enthusiasm for the game. I know that things in eve take effort, and I'm hesitant to put in the increased effort alongside increased RL stressors. So go ahead, CCP. Keep making the game *even harder* for null sec players. You'll reap what you sow. But it's ok right, you'll get tons of new players because of all the hype, right?
---
Like an autistic Tachanka at the end.
---
I forgot, you were flown out to give your expert opinion on how people should play the game! My bad! Jesus Christ, you arrogant numpty.

Tachanka main confirmed.

Defend sov?  What?

Sorry there are no statue of limitations on compounding bad game design. A broken bone set incorrectly decades ago will still effect you today.
---
Wow reading the comments. This is bad. Really bad.
---
Neither can a bot
---
Good. Half the problem down. Printing isk in capitals was fucking stupid.
---
Why would you save the loki? Assist the diamond rats by killing it faster.
---
It just.. kept going... It's.. beautiful
---
blackout, what blackout?  I just mine veldspar in high sec space then sell it at Dodixie.  :p
---
...and mats are free if you mined them yourself.
---
Some people...
---
&gt; We carried this game
---
  You don't anymore

"We ArE PaSsIoNaTe AbOuT ThE GaMe"

Why are you painting a CAPITAL also, why do you have a grapple
---
I’ve met my chuckle quota for the day, thanks
---
Its was also a great source of targets for hunters. The more content you remove from the game the more all playstyles suffer.
---
Because we be the elite pvp reeeeerrs who if ccpee make this one change i will resub an tell you all how amazing it is.... in reality i will just bitch from the sidelines or at best sub for a month an then drop it again just as quick.
---
well, looks like I missed a good fight.  Thanks for the post.  I'll take a look at zkillboard.com

Age of chaos baby!!

  Hmmm

If someone logs in to get points only... he does not count anyway.
---
There was a good topic about how quickly you get into fights: that's what needed more than free SP
---
Exactly! Path of least resistance.

Bug that prevents your entire computer from being able to function
---
vs
---
coding oversight that feeds ship info that shouldn't be fed
---
Hmmmmm. Hmmmmm, it's almost like comparing the two is completely ridiculous.
---
I agree with the pl person. Hacs too stronk. Other doctrines aren't really viable when muninn beats muninn and everything else.
---
He likes making things go boom.  Prettily.
---
The blackout isn't a bug/unintended exploit, no matter how sad you are.
---
Same. I've warped on grid with an alt that was cloaked and could see them on the overview and in space. The alt still looked like they were completely cloaked.
---
Oof, this must have been in game for a long time. I saw behavior from bots/players that kind of fit the bill of seeing this information.
---
That won't stop people from using it. The people that would use (mostly bots) are already going against the EULA. This needs to be fixed ASAP
---
Except Dwayne is talking about legitimate depression. And the other guy is talking about being "depressed" b/c they took away the list of names and faces from his farm grounds chat room. =)
---
Has to feel pretty good that they think you are this important.
---
Oof my feelings :(
---
Clearly never been to the eve gate.
---
i think they forgot - the krabs in null only accept moderate and knowable risks.
---
The Goon super move and the NC. super move was only the most watched move ops in recent memory. If you're too oblivious to keep up then sorry mate.
---
DO IT
---
&gt;2019-09-02 15:04:31 Lean Well the fact they have spies or pay people to lose posh ships to them is enough to say they lack skill in the game.
---
This guy belongs to your side. I know, the shit some people from that side say...
---
I agree but here is the catch 22. It’s hard being a new player because you are really behind and it’s close to impossible to feel like it’s even worth playing because you are lacking skills. I get it that that is not true but I have three friends that basically log on every day to set a new set of skills and then log off. They just think that there is nothing for them.
---
F
---
long range weapons to strong, HAS should not have range bonus and should not be as fast as muninns are. only BS should have range bonuses + maybe assault BC. medium structures+JB+beacons+jammers should have set DPS limit to max 5minutes, large and x-large 10minutes
---
Depending on where you claimed it, the answer is that no one wants that space or the people who do are too busy fighting each other.
---
Don't know if it is still true, but cloaked ships used to trigger the warp in sound effect you hear when something lands on grid with you.  Used that to ninja mine wormholes a couple years ago.
---
Smoothbrain posting in action ^
---
He's *one* of the autists we have.
---
Well I was referring to the ppl who are hunting the capital class ships. Not ppl with lots of accounts.
---
We'll bring this up with CCP tomorrow morning at the Summit meeting.  Thanks!
---
Wait, whose stuff did you RF for good fights? I tried RFing some stuff with a small group but Tribute is basically one big blue blob it seems like. Like 5 diff alliances all came and we just left.
---
Mm no. Sorry dude. Why things were changed in the past is in the past, there has to be a limit for it to actually be relevant. Otherwise why even stop at talking about this game, we can talk about the entire gaming industry and our grandfathers choices that still affect us today.
---
I won't argue about difficulties finding interesting PvP for new players, but new players definitely have something to do. Few quick examples: solo pvp - see Suitonia videos, or join newbie friendly corps for fleets. There is also some interesting PvE content: I've made more than a few billions doing exploration,  was quite fun.
---
So theoretical, not practical. Same ways that titans can wipe an entire fleet but strangely enough they seldom do. Hmm, I wonder if its actually a bit harder than advertised... Hmmmmmmmm.
---
Theoretical, not practical. Make this your lifemotto and whenever you feel like saying something try to apply it. You will do better in life, promise.
---
Ohh you are absolutely right. I am in the Same mindset too. But when those things start to become mundane is the part where you start to lose the new players. Imo you have to get into pvp asap so I do agree with the join a Corp thing, but some people are really strange about corps that are not just a group of their friends. It’s a scary thing for some.
---
This is definitely a game that needs guidance. Some of the best you'll ever get is from bittervets like me and EVE University as a whole since it's dedicated to exactly that.
---
I may be tripping, but in the last few weeks or so I swear I’ve been able to hear cloaked people warp on/off grid from me too.
---
I was being sincere. If they feel you are important that's a compliment.
---
lol adding in station mini games is not going to save eve, if anything it will exacerbate the issue of shrinking player numbers because a a portion of the ones who stay will now be playing games in station instead of being out in space where they can create interactions with other players.
---
I'm well aware, again, there is no upper limit on citadels. If you want five hundred in a system you can have them, if you want a thousand you can have them. Just because when we were bashing dickstars some systems had over a hundred doesn't change the fact that with citadels, EVERY system can have an unlimited amount of them. 
---
On top of that it's not like you can just tower every moon and defend them to prevent anyone else anchoring one, anyone can anchor one, anywhere, at any time. Add in the ridiculous time it takes to kill one for good measure and they are far worse than having to spend two nights powering through the odd +100 moon system in a region.
---
&gt; "we are too bad for this" is not a valid argument in a balance discussion.
---
Oh no, those Cloakybears might have a possible counter too thier elite gameplay.
---
It was a long time ago before cynos became the standard fit on everything. The content isnt getting removed. There are loads of dumb people. I would rather kill subs than watch people mindlessly print infinite isk in absolute safety with near2 and cyno.
---
Its the knowable aspect that bothers me the most. For me this change reminds me of the mutaplasmid introduction. You remember the ree from the PvPers where they stated that it would ruin the balance because now chance got introduced? I agreed with them regarding the fact that introducing chance is a game like this is bad. Not to mention the tiericide aspect.
---
Now we got the biggest chance factor in the game, the blackout, and all of the sudden the same group of people are hailing it.
---
How can you tell people that they should invest tons of time into a game when they can die without even having had a chance. Like the knowledge aspect is just gone and you get fked based on if someone else was in the vicinity or not. I will never agree to something like that.
---
The horror
---
Ah yes, talking mad shit and bragging about dunking on FCON with NC. and PL holding your hand, yet you left every single ally you had out to dry, including your coalition. You talk big about dropping on FCON yet you folded as soon as you faced adversity. You talk big about being elite while you blobbed FCON while being hard carried by PL, NC and Skillu, but as soon as you got to fight someone of equal size and ability, you got hyper dunked. You guys talked mad shit about how you were an elite supercap entity, but got evicted without fighting and then jumped your move op into Uemon like 30 IQ retards.
---
Never change TRI never change.
---
pretty sure that's a buff to subs buddy
---
If nobody is good enough for it then it is valid little friend. And since you failed to show me a single fleet that got wiped then it would probably mean that my viewpoint is a bit closer to reality than yours.
---
This is actually pretty good Rasta
---
It's only game. Why you heff to be mad?
---
Oh hi :)
---
As someone who likes to hop into fw low sec looking for hot frig on frig action.  It’s either v spamming who dock when I get close or brick tanked punishers who hold you till everyone else can warp in and whore on the kill.  
---
I don’t have the answers on how to fix fw.  Maybe make sites so once in can’t leave for 5minutes? Or until a kill is recorded. Cooldown on jump gate?
---
Sorry slightly off topic, but how the hell do you manage to keep finding sites.   
---
I have tried in HS when I first got into game, nothing around except wormholes and combat sites.   
---
On one account moved to Null, open up the cosmic exploration, 1 anomaly in like 8 systems within 10 jumps, go around scanning. NOTHING.   
---
Where are these sites that people talk about. I have spent hours searching and found one data in hi sec. Thats it.
---
And this sort of thing is why you should never post salt in mega coalition discords...
---
Thanks Land!
---
What you're describing has been done for years already. Intel bots have sat at the start of pipelines and auto typed character name and ship callouts in Intel channels
---
Just means I am good at what I do
---
Bonus points 4 it been a white claw u beautiful bastard
---
You can't opt out of changes that effect the game today. POS code is still messing things up today.
---
Go to wspace, if you keep on top of dscan it's pretty safe. Much more empty than null, and gatecamps aren't really a thing. Just don't bother with holes near major trade hubs.
---
This is so specific... And true to a certain extent lol
---
Probably. But now that it's public, it'll get abused like never before, by the people who didn't know anyway. A fix needs to be implemented yesterday.
---
So you go afk pre-blackout and your rorq gets tackled while you're away - you get back to screen and call for help and afk vni dies regardless or you warp it out before going away. How did blackout change that?
---
The thing holding Eve back is its philosophy, its too hardcore to attract casual players. If the game would go more casual in HS it would give new players a chance to learn the rules before realising the knowledge gap. Its by far the dumbest thing CCP has done, failure to adress the HS issue strictly based on a ideological basis. 
---
A player also needs tons of guidance the first couple of months. Like it should openly direct you and give suggestions based on what you like. 
---
But the main thing that needs changing imo is the first few minutes of the game. Imagine if you as a new player gets thrown into one of the big mega battles that has happened. Like in a simulator instead of that crappy first "mission". They can relive a great battle (without tidi though, well hide that tidbit from them) and realise what can happen. The stuff that they have read about is right there. Let them learn the basics in the sim whilst being able to interact with the battle.
---
I think alot just get disappointed when they play the game for the first time. Its just massively boring.
---
&gt; since you failed to show me a single fleet that got wiped
---
how about you grab some alliance mates and go be a rolemodel. l2p and actually wipe out a fleet. CCP gave you everything you need for that.
---
We should have a no TEST posting week
---
Does that have a sound effect associated with it? Over the last few days when I've been in WHs scanning/exploring i swear I am hearing the sound effect of ships warping to/from grid. I wonder if I am hearing cloaked ships coming and going?
---
Not all PVE players are bots. People really need to start learning the difference. 
---
As much as legit PVE needs any advantage it can get these days, this kind of shit is only something botters would try to defend. It's clearly not meant to exist.
---
EVE players are to nerds what nerds are to normal humans. That means we never really "quit", we just take breaks, but eventually our neuroses can only be satisfied by this game, and we return. 
---
I've been on and off for 11 years now. It never goes away.
---
Exactly, he wrote that whole post saying what we all know...
---
Bravo, bravo. Please can we get this made into a song on YouTube? Please?
---
Yo chill I'm just saying
---
Fucking bots dead again sashir
---
Yes, every single krab that hasn't undocked cause no local, can now play as safely as ever, even safer!
---
I actually tried exploring in wormholes, and all I found were "Forgotten" sites, which according to EVE Uni are dangerous because of the Sleepers. Do I just try and find the "Ruined" Relic/"Central" Data sites?
---
Here's the page I'm referencing, unsure if it's accurate still: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Relic_and_data_sites
---
I mean we only need to introduce the AT but in a simpler form. Im certain it would work and abyssal pvp seems to be liked so just a merger would surely work. And it would certainly be the silver bullet for all those arguing that they would rather want to fight PvPers and not to just gank stuff.
---
This would solve so many of our issues and it wouldnt take much dev time since the basics are already there.
---
Damn...  good catch.   I use to the guy that wants to do this kind of stuff but I got tired of being an unpaid beta product tester.
---
That's a two sided coin tho. If they are going to start screwing with the Intel tools being used, they'd have to also nerf the hunting tools. Like, for example, the dotlan ratting heat maps, or even the in-game map stats on player locations.
---
You can't bitch about Intel being too powerful and only expect the nerfs to hit the Intel you don't like.
---
&gt; For one, rorqs have been argued against by NS from the start. Dont put the same shit CCP is pulling today, i.e., disregarding player input, on us. We argued against it, we still argue against it.
---
Congrats that’s not relevant but cool
---
&gt; Also, they werent left unchecked, they got nerfed like 3 times during the period you argue "went unchecked" so Im not really sure you were even playing then.
---
Entirely possible I missed some shit but all I remember is a pretty mild excavator nerf like 1.5-2 years ago
---
&gt; But all of this is besides the point. Why are you even arguing about these things if youre not playing anymore?
---
Cuz I don’t have time to play anymore but I still care about the game. I did sacrifice my social life for like 3 years playing this sonofabitch
---
Delete HAW guns, create a second siege module that gives tank penalties or not ewar immune or something along those lines and gives HAW like tracking bonus and damage nerf to capital guns
---
 probably because I'm not trolling ! lol
---
Yes... Titans and Supers banned from lowsec probably
---
I sang this in my head reading it
---
&gt;You're using nukes to beat annoying bees.
---
I'm pretty sure that the annoying bees are more likely to show up in titans than bombers, though.
---
r/Eve is like following your college football team after you graduate.
---
Fun to see whatever new drama comes up.  Fun to yell whatever chant you used to yell.  Even if it's the depressing expectation that the team is going to choke.  Again.
---
Lol. Ccpls.
---
C1-3 will also spawn pirate sites like nullsec
---
https://i.imgur.com/XXdDQNp.jpg
---
fuck thats funny
---
Bet
---
The thing is, if people wouldnt bother roaming then its because they found something they enjoy more. And thats a good thing. I doubt roaming would stop but I do belive instanced PvP would alleviate much of the problems small gang have with the game atm. 
---
And the thing is, nobody is forced to it. You dont wanna do it nobody will make you. You wanna do it you just click a few buttons and youre in. Could be competitions around it and so on. Allow people that just PvP to make a living of it. Stream it for marketing purposes.
---
I mean I wouldnt go hardcore into it but I would most def from time to time do it. Rather that than having to jump through entire empty regions just to find a ratter thats somewhat afk.
---
This is Falcon's alt account isn't it?
---
Depends on smaller it has been around sub 50man fleets it was less but escalated because of politics in the region. It's like older pure blind though content for smaller groups out there. You just had bad luck it seems Jin taan has some content up from here from his group fighting centii.
---
Yes. Just yes.
---
Great idea but then you will simply have goons tbrowing weight around and no one able to stop them
---
*chuckles*
---
I'm in danger!
---
You need to look for wormholes Class 1-3. You can tell at a glance by clicking "Show Info", "Unknown Space" is what you want. "Dangerous Unknown" and "Deadly Unknown" are C4-5 and C6.
---
wormholer btw
---
Honestly its one of the games hidden gems. But so fked that it might as well not even exist.
---
Fly a heron or buzzard then. They're cheaper and get the job done.
---
Press S to spit on grave.
---
#S
---
man I've been hearing this too. I thought I was going mad
---
Oh god no it's exactly what we wanted to happen how awful.
---
* Battleship Alpha (murders cruisers size up to to caps in high numbers)
---
* Sub cap AOE DD weapon (deletes opposing subcaps)
---
* Super cheap (who cares if you bleed)
---
* Loves chain booshing (engage at your optimal then disengage as you please)
---
* Highly maneuverable (into warp, on grid speed etc)
---
* Can spam through wormholes in max numbers
---
Whats not to love about it?
---
Wormhole Statics have a larger mass requirement to be rolled, non statics have a wider range to be rolled. 
---
Belts have a random respawn timer instead of consistent, and All newly spawned belt have a chance of being 100% ochre
---
Tell that to CCP... They seem to hold PCU in high regard.
---
Double check your d-scan range and angle. If he truly warped in, not de cloak, then you would have seen him on d-scan a while ago.
---
ironic how you have cursed more than a vocal whining shitlord native to this shithole in the span of two comments
---
I see you guys have been doing good whaling in waffles though, Provi has changed for sure but there's still places where you can get those engagements.
---
You can blops without a blue eyes but the effort is a bit much it was like a year and a half now I think last time I went actually blopsing on a deployment. We made like 20bil each the two of us hunting but the effort was pretty big (two accounts subbed for hauling fuel/cap boosters alone) then hunters and time hunting.
---
I did really enjoy it but it would be hard to recommend to anyone because of the changes more waiting so they have to be really patient and enjoy the hunt which most people don't seem to like.
---
Dude it freaks me out every time. Especially because I sometimes forget to cloak due to distractions and I am just sitting at the WH. Would really like for it to stop lol.
---
I love eve blackout or not.  May unsub for a bit but one in a while but biomass is not an option for me.
---
There hasnt been anything noteworthy since lifeblood and that was kinda meh. We need a real expansion, dunno what that would be but something of value that gives us content, not abyssal and trigs. And the new shipline is broken, they even admit it themselves.
---
Is that my Buzzard? Pretty sure I have the exact same fit....
---
I completely agree with this. The NPE is much better than before but could be pushed a bit more and like you and Hilmar are suggesting the challenge curve needs lower lows and higher highs.
---
The claw is the law
---
Laughed very hard
---
Right. Because it’s obviously more effective to join an enemy fleet as a spy and split dps, effectively doing nothing at all except messing up broadcasts, than it is to just join your own side’s fleet and fly properly
---
I'm hoping for an adjustment to cyno changes that imposes the same restrictions on combat drops while making it less aids to JF and move caps around for staging/logistics.
---
How is it not relevant? Everybody keeps talking like we wanted the Rorq. 
---
Mild? You mean the first nerf that was 50%? Or the second one that was about 25%? Or the third one what was about 33%? A total nerf of about 75% during that period is mild? Not to mention the cluster nerfs. Na dude, there was nothing mild about it. 
---
But it was still broken and that has to do with scaleability. And we as players cant fix that, thats CCPs area. Dont blame the players who have said the same thing to CCP for years and have been neglected. Funny thing is, now with the blackout and the cyno changes, guess which ship is the safest to use...
---
No... veldspare.
---
But that doesnt affect null, we can't do that changeeee
---
It does affect null... They won't be able to use lowsec to move fleets to deploy anymore.
---
It does yes. But its ccp, they arent thinking this way
---
Yeah, they have you that change with Indy cyno.
---
[I wish I knew how to quit you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwlYo8EYTWI)
---
Eve is like an STD. You can treat it but there is no cure and it will always come back.
---
I live in lowsec, so I can hope, right?
---
That's not a bug, it's and **Upcoming Feature**
---
Dotlan gone wouldn't be a massive issue tbh, the ingame map has npc kill stats aswell.
---
&gt;How is it not relevant? Everybody keeps talking like we wanted the Rorq.
---
I really don't care whether it was wanted or not it does not matter to me lol
---
&gt;Mild? You mean the first nerf that was 50%? Or the second one that was about 25%? Or the third one what was about 33%? A total nerf of about 75% during that period is mild? Not to mention the cluster nerfs. Na dude, there was nothing mild about it.
---
Like I said maybe I'm wrong it's been a while but I don't remember it being that drastic. Regardless none of those fixed the real problem with rorqs, scaleability, and how fucking insane they were to kill. Not to mention excavators in depots.
---
I don't blame the players for that, there's plenty to blame this risk averse shitshow of a playerbase for but not that.
---
This is amazing
---
The OG botters.
---
I always did look good in corduroy.
---
Sir I don't think you understand that for every cap dropping cyno douche or afk miner that unsubs your absence has literally have no negative effect on the rest of eve. Good to see you go.
---
It’s a shame you had to make a post on Reddit at the same time that you sent a bug report. Could have at least given them a week or two to try and get it fixed. Certain people will take advantage of this now that they know and I don’t see it being an ‘easy fix’
---
think the majority of miners would take veldspar over ochre, seeing as people will avoid that stuff like it's the plague
---
It was drastic. It went down from 400m/h to around 100m during that period. But the issue with it was never really the income, it was that it became the mainline mining ship. CCP wanted titans online, there is no other way to perceive it. They thought people would fight more and it would generate more buzz.
---
Instead it started an arms race and people are more scared than ever to lose their superfleet.
---
Cool - Downvoted you cause I am nice.
---
Its honestly not an awful ore it just has a lot of isogen where other stuff gives a lot of it as well. Its nox and trit ratio is pretty nice.
---
Aww:( I know, it hurts to be wrong. But you will make it through this hard time. Chin up buddy!
---
Are you taking a position of bots being okay for the game?
---
When I first started playing this game I was told undocking means you are in danger. Try imagining your ship as a bunch of pixels
---
The botters just create new accounts with the refer a friend bonus and they're more or less back in business again. It doesn't permanently remove them from the game unfortunately.
---
They didnt apply properly
---
Flair explains it all
---
I just logged this morning to get on an entosis fleet, not expecting any action, and we ended up RFing an entire constellation then dunking 30bil+ of FRT caps.  The feed was delicious.  Literally not a single loss.
---
Thats a totally normal combination
---
Silly tapi :)
---
what in god's name am I looking at, I think I could count every pixel on that picture
---
The word you’re looking for is not “rouges”; it’s parasites.
---
85% of all r/eve residents dont play the game anymore.
---
nah my brain ain't big enough for buzzards
---
Hi, this corp has applied for membership in HYDRA RELOADED. Please convo me to discuss what you know, as this will impact their application.
---
Newflash- Null Players using  narrow view of limited available data proclaim sky is falling during back to school week to cherry pick information in order to present case that their preferred way of empirebuilding is better for the game after years of abusing cette system.
---
This is my *shocked Pikachu* face.
---
I dont disagree. Understanding the past is always relevant. But getting stuck in it is always bad. Todays game is todays game (a relevant timeframe), we need to handle todays issues and not get stuck in how things were and trying to regress the game based on nostalgia.
---
That never works. Like ever. 
---
Mainly because the human brain doesnt work all that great, our memories are always distorted and those tiny details that were the driving force behind changes gets forgotten. Like how CCP buffed NS to get people to actually live there so there would be more content, which in itself was a great change but is getting regressed atm. People have simply forgotten. 
---
Yet the clamor for the "good ole days". I wasnt in the game back then but Im fairly certain it wasnt all that great and people were constantly talking about the "good ole days" even back then. Its human nature. Grass is always greener and all that. 
---
Im a pragmatist, I only care about the past as a learning tool because I know its gone forever. But my main focus is today (a relevant timeframe). And during this period the list of nerfs to NS is bigger than the buffs. And saying "a little pull back and all the PvEers are going crazy" is disingenuous (which was what the guy I replied to was saying). 
---
Its been constant nerfs ontop of nerfs and these last ones broke the camels back. And its showing, all metrics are pointing in the same direction, straight down. No metrics of what we can see is showing any other direction. That should trouble you.
---
GET THIS MAN SOME FREE PLEX
---
I mean, I hate to say I am not surprised. And for sure botters knew about this. And others knew about this.
---
Sashir, bots fixed. Thanks!
---
Not poor krabs. They are rich and continue to make money, just not utilzing nullsec. The reason why I have a slight concern for that, is that CCP is killing null and making it a place that slowly pushes people out, and never rewards them for the increased risk. It has now become the smart decision to mission run or market trade in hisec as compared to ratting/mining in NS. Pretty much the only nice thing about null is supercaps (which are going out of style because of our valued allies CCP), reactions, and t2 production, and maybe some moon mining if you are in a rich enough region like venal, malpais, or delve. Null is slowly losing interest from many players at this point, and that is a problem. Everyone is crowding into HS at this point, and the only thing thats really been happening in hisec is the trig invasion...
---
The game is way more fun to read about than to play.  I don't shitpost too much and am not bitter.  I have too many other obligations and video games with IRL friends to play.  If firefox didn't decide that this would be my default sub on my home page then I would read about it in every few months out of curiosity.  now i read it often mostly looking for good video of fights without the awful music.
---
The OP said (or someone else) said the last time they looked for anything like this was 2012, so potentially 7 years.
---
Yeah I saw that comment by someone else. Be absolutely insane if it's been that long.
---
It’s not a game. It’s a way of life.
---
One of many
---
God bless you
---
I was writing about Jupyter. Have you used it?
---
I wonder what all else is possible :0
---
there's nothing that says "shitposting enough on r/eve will make it fun" though and some people seem to disagree
---
They'd warp off anyway with local, so it makes no difference about 'killing shit'. Do you hear yourself?
---
What it does tho it balanced out the economy somewhat which had gone totally bonkers.
---
There is very much an active blue donut when it comes to kinds of conflict that retains and bring back players and headline making conflicts.
---
I've been using a Drake for some simple combat anomaly sites and missions up to level2. I have all T1 modules, shield tanked, just over 200DPS i think, and around 9k shields. What do I need to do to go to Level 3 missions / sites? I'm sure I went to a level 3 and got my buttocks handed to me. I'm training up to be able to fit better upgrades / some better weapons. 
---
Secondly, I can apparently fit a basic cloak to my Drake - should I bother if I want to do some mid-sec anomalies / exploring? Guides I've read for things like wormholes focus on higher Tier / smaller ships, with T2 modules / [cloak](https://cloak.It). It also says you have to keep it at minimum velocity - is there a definition of what 'minimum' is? I'm a bit confused.
---
That's happening anyway now.
---
Setting up a new region, installing infra and then ratting and occupying a place few regions away from home system, pushing indexes up will become quite cumbersome while their infra gets harrassed back home.
---
Not really, although it helps JFs a bit. 
---
-For JFs, t1 industrials are probably pretty aids to get to every system you want to cyno to, especially if it's NPC null. There's no real reason *not* to allow noobships or t1 frigs for JF cynos; a t1 indy doesn't "generate more content" than a noobship (both are pretty much 0), it just makes logistics more work without adding any benefit to anyone. 
---
-If you're a Small Independent Lowsec Alliance that Don't Need No Cynobeacons, it's now pretty aids to buy a dread 2j out of your staging and move it to staging. (If you're a nullbloc dude, imagine missing a moveop and being stranded 3 cynos out of your home regions; it's 300m per jump to move your caps home if the cynos die.) This isn't the impact on combat drops/rorq saves; it's harder to move from Point A to Point B outside of combat, and it's *specifically* worse for solo pilots/small groups moving small numbers of caps, since you'll be less cost-effective if your cyno dies each jump. 
---
If the main point of this change was to take cynos off ratting supers, then this is all incidental fallout; it makes some people put in more work, but doesn't generate much or any new content. That's not ideal and could be avoided.
---
&gt;When I first started playing this game I was told undocking means you are in danger. Try imagining your ship as a bunch of pixels
---
I would like to direct your attention to the following portion of the comment that you are replying to:
---
&gt; If you don't think about it very hard and just quote the "hurr, EVE is  supposed to be dangerous" catchphrase, that might sound GREAT to you.  However, after a bit of critical thinking, or a lot more time and  shrinkage of the playerbase, it becomes obvious that there's a big  difference between danger that is unavoidable and danger that tests your  skills, vigilance, and/or intelligence. 
---
While EVE is, indeed, considered "dangerous", that does not mean that anything that constitutes "danger" should be above scrutiny.
---
While certain kinds of danger can add excitement and challenge, other kinds simply add frustration and anger. A critical difference between the two is whether or not the danger can potentially be overcome through through one's own merits - being in danger of dying if you aren't careful, vigilant, or skilled enough is one thing, being in danger of dying with no recourse every time someone decides they want to kill you is another matter entirely.
---
Did you ever play Counterstrike? If so, do you remember just how much everyone LOVED snipers in that game? There's a good reason for that, and that reason applies to post-blackout / cyno nerf EVE, too.
---
&gt;Why do our ships begin decelerating immediately after reducing thrust, in a vacuum the ship should continue at the same speed when thrust is removed.
---
Christ. They Tried that in Elite: Privateer.  Combat was an utter shitshow and the physics literally did your head in...
---
It's an opt-in optional deployment sig that goes where content tends to occur.
---
One of the few reasonable statements on here
---
Asher can be mean whilst being nice. It's a rare gift. I heard his words alone can boil water and his glare causes alcohol poisoning without the perks 😟
---
"We want to make things more difficult for more experienced players"
---
This includes not making it trivial to move logistics. Perhaps since it's slightly more difficult now, space closer to trade hubs will actually have more value, and geography will form.
---
You're not getting any sympathy with "but the lil guys!!!" Because those are the guys that adapt best and figure it out without pissing and moaning their gameplay is dead. Caps should take significant effort to use, work with, and move. God forbid people have to *think* and *plan* when using their end game ships instead of treat them like cruisers amirite?
---
When the devs that made the most valuable item randomly spawn every minute on every world and had a bug where when you kill a player for any cash you get max cash stack are making a less abuseable and buggy client uh you've got some problems lol.
---
Well CCP finally listened and is doing something about the super rating / umbrella meta.
---
They are very fair exceptions:
---
Plex is a very special, in most ways ‘out of game’ item for which ‘production’ hasnt kept up with isk production, due to the specific nature of plex production which is the result of converting real money into plex. 
---
Tier 2 items would have become more expensive regardless as a result of fundamental changes in their production.
---
In pretty much all other respects, and in a manner that is relevant for most players, isk buying power has increased over the past few years, not decreased. Ships, etc.
---
😆
---
But but meh legacy code bruv
---
How do I find my way out? Is there a database of current wormhole maps where I can eventually plot a map back to my market hub to sell stuff? I know Pathfinder exists, but it only just tracks where I've been.
---
You keep scanning until you find your way out. It's not as scary as it may sound, but definitely get comfortable with watching dcsan as you fly and hack, and learn to use the mappers. Holes are always changing and moving, you rarely know where it leads exactly
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW3DFyzfEhI
---
Ok. What's your point?
---
[beat you to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW3DFyzfEhI)
---
Same here. Move from having 3 subs for years to 1. I do join the occasional strat op or CTA but have gone a bit more dormant and am mostly a weekend warrior now, playing 3-4 hours a week tops
---
One issue with the dynamic is that if you bring T1 hulls as opposed to T2 hulls, your opponent can completely counter you with T2 hulls. It won't even be a contest, just a one-sided slaughter. Basically, the cost to entry for real war has gone up significantly on the alliance level, which means that risking a full welp is unreasonable for small, independent entities.
---
inb4 nolak ataru goes attention whoring again
---
&gt; another small not: setting log viewer to higher than warning on my device really killed performance.... probably a Linux thing
---
Not a linux thing, if you set it to "info" you can expect 1 fps as soon as anything so much as warps decloaked onto your grid
---
Yeah that was me, last time I dug around for it couldn't have been any later than 2012. When I discovered the log viewer (or rather at that time the "debug" stuff), I scoured through it looking for anything useful and found nothing
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98169165/stats/
---
Brave Newbies was started just after the Battle of Asakai in 2013. Looking at Brave Newbies losses on that stats page, 2014 was the year of the big feed. They were either still in Rahadalon or Barleguet at that time.
---
Is wally still ceo?
---
Then you would expect a rise in new account creation. Have we seen that?
---
You are absolutely right that people will simply not undock and do certain things. People only have a certain tolerance. CCP expects everything to stay the same, and krab and bot behavior to stay the same. WRONG, people change and adapt and overcome. Now people are just moving to other professions, and quite frankly worse ones because they can no longer do what they enjoyed. Enjoyment is key. Without it, people log off and simply dont play. It would be a wise buisiness decision for CCP to appease as many people as they can if they are trying to pump up numbers. NEWS FLASH, r/eve is not an accurate representation of the EVE Online playerbase!!
---
is this isk begging i hear?
---
Alright, just jumped intp wspace; here goes. Thanks for the help!
---
No problem! Make sure you bookmark everything!
---
Intel bots using OCR (image -&gt; text) don't know if you've cloaked, jumped out of system, just come into system, etc. They only know that a player appeared on overview and then left overview, however that could have happened.
---
By scraping the logs, you can effectively know whether they just jumped in, jumped out, cloaked, warped off, etc. It is nearly perfect gate intel.
---
&gt; Caps should take significant effort to use, work with, and move. 
---
I'd generally agree with this except that it's still trivial for goons/test/PL/etc to move 200 of them across space whenever they feel like, but now genuinely problematic for 1 guy to jump a haw dread into npc sov to yolo into a gatecamp later. That seems like the wrong direction to take. 
---
&gt;"the lil guys" ... are the guys that adapt best and figure it out
---
This is usually wrong. Malcanis's Law (bigger, established groups are in a better position to cope with changes than small groups with limited resources) applies to many changes, but *especially* any nerf to logistics. In particular, big sov groups don't have to care about 300m cynos because can use beacons; and groups with lots of forts/keeps can use the citadel guns to cover cynos. 
---
None of these changes are *insurmountable*; as a small-alliance lowsec nerd with no sov/citadels/supers, I've already figured out how I'm going to adjust to deal with the changes. It just makes us put more work into setting ships up, instead of setting fights up.
---
I can believe that.  2014-15 was the best year for lowsec.  Then the jump changes occurred, and capital proliferation took over.
---
People have been saying "eve is dying" for like the past 8 years
---
Can confirm; I gave up after cyno change was announced. Having either local OR an umbrella gives you a degree of control over your survival, undocking something non-cloaky without either is just offering up a free killmail to whichever bomber gang notices you first.
---
Hopefully, things will start getting better after Hilmar gets his bonus and fucks off; at that point he won't be so desperate to inflate short term numbers with zero concern for long-term damage (assuming he even keeps his job).
---
HAW Titan nerf, FAX nerf, HIC nerf, Excavator size increase, NSA nerf, fighters nerf, Drifters, blackout, cynos...  
---
I don't know.  If you whine about something in nullsec enough, maybe CCP will slide it to easy mode for you.
---
The "one guy yoloing a dread" has already thrown the isk for that dread away. Wanna do it now? Potentially throw another 300m at it. Nothing stopping that.
---
I've heard plenty about MaLcAnIs' LaW and more people use it as a cop out than anything. The number of Bloc members screaming about it instead of smaller groups really turns it into Malcanis' Fallacy. People will adapt, and it will be fine. Should it not be easier to use caps with a significant network set up to support them, like blocs have? Sure seems to make sense to me.
---
Null is like driving across the Western US. Sure you have population centers in LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Denver, but most of the rest of it is empty space with no one in it. Delve is like LA and San Diego Area and then they basically control everything around it because it's lifeless desert for hundreds of miles once you cross the mountains just west of the valley. It's blue donut by default. If there were enough people that wanted to live in null to fill all those buffer regions, maybe there would be more content. Right now, Legacy just keeps expanding to fill empty space. 
---
Also, you might note that Legacy is actively at war with Frat and invading them. Is that not content? Where are NC. and PL and skillu and tri and all the Russians and countless other groups? Did they all go to hisec/lowsec/wormholes or did they leave the game?
---
My money's on him quitting; he's made it pretty clear that EVE is no longer a long-term investment for him.
---
about the pod loss- you sank your 0.5b the moment you plugged them in, so no need to worry about the loss there. instead do the +4 ones (around 100m for the whole set, maybe even skip charisma you're enough charismatic as it is). it's only a 1.5 sp/minute loss, +5s take you around 250 days of skill training to net you a skill injector worth of sp over +4s.
---
and if you ever look into spending more than half bil into implants again, check out faction sets such as snake, amulet, crystal, virtue etc. which improve performance in an area significantly (speed, armor hp, shield boost, scan strength for the ones i mentioned) while still increasing attribute values.
---
Will give larger groups more power, not less.
---
What to mean by this?
---
How do you know? What ccp is doing now isn't working. Large fleet fight will be a thing of the past in 8 days. Hating capitals doesnt work in tidi.
---
I guess not that long.
---
There is the bug which ppl can see cloaked ship on overview and I think that bug is kinda associated with this issue.
---
Visible cloaked ship bug occurred like  6 month ago so maybe then I guess.
---
It's even worse than that, I made a script as a PoC that could always uncloak anyone on grid with you with injection, a cute script, and some probes, as soon as they come on to grid with you. 
---
It used something similar to this for triggering it.
---
Uh, no? His semi-afk playstyle generated content for other players, while also generating enough isk to keep himself happy. Can you imagine how much happier everyone would be if there were more people exactly like him, happily krabbing away without botting, and being willing to provide content?
---
Or like, why not both?
---
14 pilots outnumbered the 100 Fraternity pilots. You had teamwork.
---
Provided you are on the proper equipment, yes.
---
They want to think they're still alive.
---
The Grey Eagles did very good. +2
---
Agreed in general.  Start off feeling epic.
---
Is it not more casual in high-sec?  I've always felt like it was.  Like, CONCORD is a pretty strong stick to keep baddies off your back.  Maybe I don't understand what you mean when you say casual.
---
The other thing to consider with "casual" gaming is time.  It takes a long time to do anything in eve; to feel accomplished even if that's shipping goods or finding something to kill.  The other thing about eve vs other MMOs to maximize your time "in the wilds," is that you carry everything that you **are and can do** with you wherever you go in other games.  In eve, it's dependent on your ship and fit.
---
You flew by this awesome wreck site and could have salvaged all these wrecks if you weren't in a travel ceptor to bypass null gate camps?  Oh, sorry buddy.  You're in a neat little frig and can shoot lasers super well, but you've loaded autocannons?  Ouch, yeah, so sorry but that skill that took you 10 days to train has 0 use right now.
---
In wow (plz no rage; it's **the** successful, casual MMO), you are a mage, tailor, herbalist whenever and wherever you are.  At all times.  You take it all with you.  Nothing you've ever "trained" is useless at any time.  Not so in eve.
---
Imagine having to "re-ship" into a salvager, a dps, and a industrial to move things around in World of Warcraft?  Walk the same route three times just to do what you already trained to be good at; just eating more time up.  I guarantee it would kill WoW for all but the hardcore players.
---
I'd love it if I could get on, pew pew in space, and remotely set up builds, hack stuff, do scans, mine, etc as I had the requirements for.  Then I could bring all my skills with me wherever I was.  I can do *most* all of it in WoW with just a single character.  In eve, I need to sub 7 accounts.
---
Imagine filling the eve downtime with something other than Netflix and rapid-fire dscan.  In-game activities that bring your skills to bear!  
---
Oh and then there's the re-shipping.  The buying and moving.  Ugh.  More time.  
---
Give me a ship that I can be okay with losing again and again.  I mean insurance replaces my ship and modules all.  Slap down the exact cost of the ship as insurance and fly it away.  You died?  Cool.  Here's that same ship back exactly as it was and you're that exact amount of isk poorer (you still take it from market so people get paid).  
---
Give newbies a T1 fit frig to continually lose instead of the Corvette for a few months.  Take away the fear and time sunk a little so they can explore without loss.  
---
Will that get abused?  Absolutely. Will it retain new players longer than they are currently?  I'd think so.
---
Good content
---
I don't know about Western US. But Null was always like a city centre and low population around it. It was never full like people romanticise at time.
---
Legacy can dick swing at FRT whenever they choose to, they're just keeping it going at certain pace because there is no other content. 
---
We're talking about headline making huge global wars, Legacy FRT conflict doesn't even has a name. The moment momentum swings around to FRT, they bring in Goons and it ensured that nothing can be done. So when you have 80% of null lined up, it's irrelevant whether Tri or PL shows up or not.
---
Error of chaos more like.
---
This is some dumb shit. Can we just get rid of all the dev staff and hire new ones now? Ffs.
---
But everyone who left was a bot!!!!11!!oneoneone!
---
I know at least 9001 people who have resubbed because of blackout and we are all having soooo much fun eating paste together and bragging for hours on end about how many STUPID KRABS we're going to kill....just as soon as we find some!
---
We don't need those stupid krabs anyways; they contribute nothing of value to the game. My playstyle of roaming around cloaked looking for krabs to kill can only become more successful by the removal of krabs from the game. CCP just didn't go far enough with the blackout; they just need to make it so that every time someone dies in a krabbing ship they get permabanned; then it will be gudfights forever!!11!
---
We've all done it.
---
Almost got me lol
---
Yea, blackout is a great excuse to save some money. Sadly, if they do end, they'll probably be too late, as a new habit will have occurred (take three months to establish a new habit, look at the research), so I'm probably gone for good now, and all my accounts. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Name the non-autist
---
[In less than a month Frat broke the agreement and started to evict the original owners.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3tnH4FGbd0)
---
Because you can’t have an infinite number of accounts running. If you can run a Horde spai in addition to your main/alts in Test, you could also have one more character in the Test fleet.
---
remove isogen from gneiss, spod, and ochre
---
A while back a corpmate and I roamed null in bombers. I could hear the warp in noise as he was landing on grid, cloaked. I thought I was going crazy...
---
Is it still a scam or ??  Havent heard much out of their community these days
---
Wally is our Dad
---
Thanks.
---
But before, there were lots of big blocs and coalitions all across the map. There just aren't any more. There are 40 regions in nullsec. You could cut it to 15 regions and there still would be empty space. What exactly do you want people to fight over? With the way CCP made rorquals, endless anomalies, moons, citadels, and skill injectors, you could fit all of the null population in a single region and probably still not run out of anomalies to mine/rat in. It's just going to keep getting worse, until those things are balanced differently or in some cases completely removed. This game is boring as shit and the mechanics are geared towards megakrabbing. Now with blackout and cyno changes, many of the megakrabbs will leave. But tons of the PVP guys just cycled out of the game, got bored, aged out or whatever. The last 3 years of mechanics changes really put the gameplay into a shitty spot that is going to be really, really hard to undo. 
---
The good news for CCP (maybe) is that most of the playerbase of EVE still lives in highsec and doesn't give two shits about any of this. If they can remake the nullsec gameplay, maybe they can survive long enough off their hisec/lowsec playerbase to rebuild a nullsec playerbase. But many people will have just moved on by then and probably never return too. So they still need to work on their new player acquisition and retention. I dunno, the state of EVE is a mess.
---
I was a sniper in that game. And the point is there are ways to avoid dying as a capital krab - stay aligned, d-scan, have a recon. You are all making a bit of a hoo haa as usual but in the short term you will adapt and in the long term it will be the norm.
---
Eve has sound?
---
I might like meming about windrunners aand shit but i thought i found an exploit with resetting cycle timers for modules when entering warp amd exploiting it for a 40% ROF increase but this takes the cake.  
---
This is on par with the duplicating of reaction material in poses 8 or so years ago.  Crazy shit, good find, hard to detect as no one stops to think about the existing debug tools
---
This is not ok
---
This guy gets it
---
The t1 indy especially sucks if you want to do a single pickup in a spot outside of your normal path. Moving a t1 indy on a cyno pilot 10 jumps in low or null is gonna suck
---
holy shit you beat a bomber fleet with trigs and nestors... congrats on overkill?
---
Countless comments on this and other threads pissing and moaning that they actually have to pay attention to their Eve client now and can't mine/rat with it minimized whilst playing other games, watching movies, etc.
---
What "doesn't add up" is how many people think they are entitled to the ability to "play" Eve Online without paying any attention to it whatsoever.
---
I'm quitting EVE. I've amassed 10 trillion ISK and I'm giving it away! Send me any amount and I'll QUADRUPLE it.
---
Quality shitpost.
---
Those midterms in the beginning of December are super close guys.
---
Oh I 100% agree with you that there needs to be Bloc level conflict drivers.
---
Sounds like a great way to identify bots.
---
CCP purposefully sends fake log data or records accounts that respond to log data.  Then mass bans a few months later.
---
How have you guys not had a coup yet?
---
I make my jf pilots do a lot of shipping to npc null in hostile sov, so I'm really worried I'll have to tip extra because of these changes :P
---
Bitter millennials talking about butter veta...  what a time to be alive Haha
---
Got to agree.
---
No Track suit no deal bud gotta give the down vote.
---
Enjoy your empty space!
---
ISK war won though
---
Have some gold!
---
What a find. Thank you.
---
No - we were ISK-positive over the 10 days we were there and the Citadel loot more than covered the loses.
---
Snuck Fuff
---
He meant the good ones...
---
They buffed inhibs?
---
:) hopefully we will get a free more changes that make it easier for a new Corp to move into null. Love you said I'm also seeing lots of newbros coming in.
---
\^ obviously has no idea how bomber alpha works...
---
And about a year later I'll be half way through my supply?
---
Don't say that word...
---
So , I was hunting explorers in my cloaky Astero last night and exactly this happened to me.I landed on the grid with explorer ( I was cloaked not closer than 2000m to any object ) and as soon as I landed he warped off. And it happened 3 times in the same system with same scenarios. Its disgusting
---
Thanks mate, you have a good one too.
---
You're "bittervet" post nails the very core reason, you just never really quit Eve.
---
Do you not realize how incredibly stupid you are? Is it too much to ask for you to do a bit of thinking for yourself? Why do you even bother posting, much less trying to argue, when you don't understand what you are talking about?
---
Does it not bother you at all that your "contribution" to this discussion consists of repeatedly expressing your ignorance and obligating me to explain things to you that you should have understood before weighing in on this issue?
---
Since doing the thinking for you and handing you the answers only seems to inspire you to further feeble-minded attempts at argument, I'll instead invite you to go rat in a carrier for an hour or so (assuming you live that long) and share the ~~killmail~~ results with the rest of us.
---
I've personally unsubbed all my accounts around the time when CCP introduced the. drifter attacks.  It wasn't for this reason alone and i even semi like the idea of the delayed local, but the cyno changes and other gimmicky ways CCP are trying to band-aid problems instead of fixing the core issues leaves me with no faith in CCP atm.  
---
Don't even get me started with CCP basically lying on stage and in a blog post about the new implants coming in summer 2019.  Not even 1 person at CCP could be bothered writing a quick blog post saying they are getting delayed or they are off the table.  Should of known after all these years CCP take an ice age to do anything.
---
Because they remember how much fun it was back in the day and they want that again so they hope maybe if they complain enough on forums maybe CCP will magically change it to something they like again. Now you could say crying on forums about how a game is shit never made a game better and I would be inclined to agree, but to be fair they did get some reaction from CCP at one point with the Incarna thing where they cried so loud that CCP has been jerking them off ever since instead of innovation at all.

Easier to just have Intel bot on gate closed since no matter what ships will still show for a split sec even if cloaking will show on overview.
---
they dropped the size from 300 something to 50, which means it's easy to spam them. They also halfed the online time.
---
I can say one thing for sure. Subcap ratting is dead to me. I'll see how the cyno changes pan out but if you ask me they're retarded. So I'll probably stop mining too. You can spend hours boson ratting without a single escalation that may or may not pay off anyway. So DED running is not much of an option to me anymore. I only have two accounts so I won't be unsubbing any. But I'll probably get a mission running alt just so I can keep paying for alliance sub cap doctrines and that's it. A lot of people I know have alts who's subs are still cycling down so to me at least it seems like that number will keep dropping. And it's not a threat or anything. They're not doing it in protest. They just don't have a use for those alts anymore so keeping them active is just a waste. And that's taking into account all the alts they're keeping active just so they can have a cyno Rapier on grid at all times. But I can go to Esoteria and kill anyone dumb enough to sub cap rat or mine with basically no risk so it's all worth the trade off right? A lot of people are just waiting around to see if the game gets any better eventually but we aren't going to keep subbing forever.
---
no idea why you got a downvote for that,  it has a startling lack of features so you genuinely aren't missing much.
---
Ah. Didn't know that. Cheers.
---
i'd probably stop listening if that's the kind of pings i got regularly.
---
at least goons try and make their hurfs moderatly amusing, they often aren't but the trying is appreciated.
---
Jokes on you he was using excavs.
---
That's fine. Those people belong in high sec. Null sec was supposed to be big rewards, constant risk, lots of action, constant war. It was for awhile. Lots more changes needed still to get back to what it used to be.        
---
Still basically impossible for a new Corp to break into active null. This shouldn't be the case imo. It was too easy for too long and they farmed to much, and now getting past an umbrella is nearly impossible.
---
I require a 1 bil delivery fee to Seddow's Father.
---
I don't think probes decloak anymore as you can launch probes and cloak on the spot, no need to get moving first before cloaking.
---
In that case, can I have your stuff?
---
Assuming they're being honest and actually did unsub. It's like a self awarded badge of honour or something. Anybody I know who did quit even if temporarily basically went dark. They've either got bigger shit to deal with or better things to do.
---
Once we get wallet and fitting functionality it will be perfect. Optional: ship spinner please.
---
no, not quite sure how much of a run up you needed to jump to that conclusion - guessing it was a fairly long one, though.
---
I expect theta to have 20 people in it seriously trying to help while the rest go play wow
---
To be fair. Most null sec entities don't have the weaponised autism to hole control for a week straight.
---
And they ask us why we make fun of goons...
---
reddit is the true endgame
---
&gt; But I believe CCP is currently working on it, so let's hope for the best least worst.
---
They have been "working on it" for 5 years and only managed to make it worse
---
To be fair we were quite lazy and only hole-controlled for 6 hours.
---
Grey eagles are the best kind of eagles!
---
Every dreadbomb that results in a dead super is successful.
---
Because it's semi-AFK. It should only get you semi-profit.
---
Extreme Angle Guns for supercaps plz
---
that used to be \~180 AU before they somehow fixed the distance
---
One person flies a (super)carrier. For subcaps you need more people.
---
The two biggest problems I see are the cost efficiency and infinite boosh. Maybe bombers themselves aren't OP but the combination is pretty nasty for the investment. They weren't meant to be a combat ship in that sense but they're surprisingly good at it. I mean that's a lot of DPS for such little cost and they aren't exactly soft targets with its sig tank. Find yourself in a fight you can win and you can alpha most subs with just a few painters. Find yourself in a fight you can't win and you just boosh on out. Chasing Stukas off is easy. Actually winning the fight they don't even have to commit to just isn't going to happen unless the FC seriously fucks up.
---
2-3 weeks ago when i was hunting solo in delve people were warping off after i warped cloaked. I tought it was a coincidence but 4 in a row? Knew something was wrong.
---
Why would you replace Feroxes that's a great boat. Best t1 BC?
---
You got me. I don't even have the patience for six hours.
---
PGGB was here!
---
What is it with Tridgit and joining goons.
---
Offensive keepstar drops? Meh, that's so yesterday...
---
They botted an entire empire together in less then 2 years, sadly they couldn't bot experience to run one. "We have enough supers and titans, lets poke legacy!"
---
They’re downvoting because of your flair haha.
---
Its easy Just use longbow corms und feddisch
---
Something similar happened to me before. I think I got ganked in hs with a giant load I got from Null sec to hs via wh. After that I did 3 smaller trips to Jita even if it took longer. I wouldn’t have survived another loss!! Tip for day tripper if you got a good load go drop it off real quick esp if you find super rare bp or high implants. BM sites you find along the way home. You can always come back to do them after the drop off.
---
Lol they batphoned Iron Crown. Those guys only have knowledge how to operate bot scripts.
---
Shush beebrain.
---
Why don't they already do that now if it's better?
---
Hell yea brother
---
Why are you playing a game you don’t enjoy much less spending time on a subreddit dedicated to said game?
---
I can’t wait for the cyno changes and the blackout rules. Hopefully they nerf anomaly spawn rates and introduce scarcity of resources.
---
Yea pretty much, they had a pretty good economic plan. In a very fucked up way.
---
I once tried it, after 15 minutes of playing eve, I switched to netflix
---
Sokay bb

["We Built this city on Rock and Roll"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1b8AhIsSYQ)
---
Apparently logs provide more info, so...
---
Thought I heard this the other day as well, and it had me thinking I was crazy.
---
you lost    
---
**7,194,394,136.02**  to  **3,385,707,301.35**    
---
**32.0 %** effy
---
out of your 47 kills 12 frigates 3 industrials 2 corvettes 2 shuttles and a bunch of other small shit which fell out of the structure you killed. the structure was 1.5bil of the 3.3bil you killed. So did you really win?
---
I was getting semi-profit. 500-600 mil in ore with 3 rorqs when I was able to login was normal income for me that would get blown away the other day while pvp.
---
&gt; More krabs is good. More krabs who get to their citadel before you're even in system is not. 
---
I've had a long day and I've had to deal with a lot of stupidity today, so you'll have to forgive me if I don't have much tolerance left for YOUR stupidity.
---
EVE does not revolve around you - "good", in the context of this game, is not defined by the degree to which something pads your killboards and/or otherwise makes you feel like the most special kid on the short bus. I can't believe that I have to explain this; if you lack the intellectual capacity to understand something THIS simple, how do you survive? How have you not been hit by a car or something by now?
---
EVE needs to generate money to keep the servers running - neither killmails nor the goodwill of retards can serve as a substitute. Those "krabs who get to their citadel before you're even in system" contribute to the survival of the game - probably more so than YOU do, given their tendency to multibox and the fact that, unlike you, their playstyle doesn't revolve around CCP-sanctioned griefing.
---
I realize this might be a difficult concept for your poor little mind to grasp, but CCP can't force people to feed you free killmails - the most they can do is to force those players to choose between feeding you and quitting EVE. What this means is that we have a choice between two scenarios: either the krabs continue to play and support the game while you cry about not being able to kill them because they warped to their citadels, or the krabs stop playing and supporting the game while you cry about not having anything to kill.
---
If, even after having it spelled out for you, you still think that the latter of those two options is preferable, you should probably stop posting.
---
Thanks for saying this. Instead of my trying to type it out. I agree go out in a cheap 1-5m isk imicus. Do a few null sec or wh and GET OUT fast.  If you make it home your loot will cover the next 10-50 imicuses essily. The ship has only a few small drones you won’t be able to kill anything that attacks you. So best to go in and out fast. Also known as ninja exploration. You can do high sec but the money is bad not worth your time. Cuz it takes the same amount of scanning time. So if you spend 4 hours scanning in h.s. Why not do it in null or wh and get much better pay out knowing that you may lose the ship. EvE is about becoming a better pilot. In this game you will lose thousands of ships. Most game operates on the concept of holding or try to keep your ship alive as long as possible. Here not so much. If you get good in EvE you can kill a better ship even if you are in a crappy one.
---
Wow. 
---
Classic wow! It sounds more up your street
---
A. Who the fuck are you and why are you so buttmad?
---
B. I did leave at one point but
---
C. I don't play enough anymore to justify going anywhere else, my friends are mostly still in tikle, and are even still active, why the fuck would I leave?
---
Well: no, it made sense that they didn't decloak each other since both clients were supposed to have no idea that another object was within 2500m. It shouldn't even be a built in mechanic, just a byproduct of the fact that cloaked ships just do not exist from another clients point of view.   
---
If anything it makes less sense now.
---
Frat broke a NIP they signed with XIX within a month.
---
I think you'll find you missed the other structure, and the kills leading up to it over a week. But you're right, we should have done better. If only it was 15 v 100 we would have won the ISK war too. Cheers mate, have a safe one.
---
I’m more disappointed with EvE Gate. Warpped all the way to the middle of nowhere to see basically nothing. It needs a big visually something. Or how’s this is you go through it, it randomly takes you another system. One way only.
---
God, I can't stand this bs test propaganda anymore
---
This particular bug has been in the game for years
---
Whoa, bringing out the big guns already?
---
It's usually best to try the "everyone who quit was a bot" one first, and reserve the WoW Classic excuse for when someone calls you on your initial bullshit.
---
I hope not. The last thing new miners need is to be caught for  only 500,000 isk worth of minerals. We want ppl to stay in the game. Not quit after a few days.
---
The accomplished the objective of evicting Frat. So, op success.
---
you lost
---
**the objective** while bringing a **100 man fleet** vs **15**
---
So did you really win?
---
We have one. The Mitanni borrows us Vily because he wants us to have a competent FC.
---
While it's basically a joke, I like to think that blackout is how CCP decided to finally fix glitchy local thing they had going for some time.
---
F ... but i can say after loosing 180 Bil (no super, titan, jf ...or anything else "BIG" ) in spaceships it is still hurting every single time :-)
---
I can't upvoted this enough.
---
Bunch of people want to make fun of high sec players, play where it's even safer, then whine when it's not safe anymore. If null is too scary, move to LS or HS.
---
It’s currently based on a constant.. I’m going to do the same thing as on the region view where you can adjust the maximum to solve exactly this..
---
Wait he has a third vanq now?
---
At least I was in space and you could do something to my ships. Now you can only deny me internet points. :)
---
Did you ever consider to share this information with CCP so it can get fixed?
---
Omg me tooooo
---
come to wh space
---
1. There were no bubbles, right? You could have still saved your pod.
---
2. An astero should have been able to warp out long before a loki can lock it. Use nanofibres and inertia stabs in the lows and not warp core stabs. 
---
3. Always orbit the can at 2000 when hacking. In reality, you'll be slightly more than 2000 due to inertia so you can immediately cloak up and spam warp when something decloaks on you. If you're sitting at zero on the can, you can sometimes get stuck in the model and bounce off while initiating warp.
---
4. " select warp to something 30km "?? Did I read that right?
---
5. Always drop off the loot at a safe spot (or a mobile depot) when you think you cannot afford to lose it and want to attempt another site.
---
6. It's a game. You win some, you lose some. Suck it up and move on.
---
The statement was that it was not in 7 years ago. So it cpuld have been in for 6 months or 6 years.
---
Turns out the logs show everything...
---
I've spent hours in lowsec and could not find anything except useless relic sites. Senpai please teach me.
---
\&gt;500-600 mil a day basically afk
---
\&gt;has srp
---
\&gt;oh no i lost my t2 fit t3. i guess i have to afk krab for 1 more hour
---
\&gt;wtf CCP
---
1. turn your volume to max
---
2. hears shield alarm
---
3. press cyno and panic
---
4. ping in discord
---
5. get 20 supers to save you in 5 minutes
---
6. go back to afk mining
---
Another week, another gamebreaking bug, eh ccp?
---
Let me explain:
---
* This is a bug, not a counter.
---
* You are retard.
---
lol, me and the boys are gonna have a good chuckle at your little tantrum post. First off, I think I understand the concept of this ecosystem better than you do. Nobody was "feeding me free kills", me and my boys killed PLENTY regardless of the circumstance throughout the time we've played eve. However, those kills previously, (specifically the PVE and mining ones) required way more effort than should have be necessary, and completely precluded casual players from participating in that side of eve. If you believe that it was previously so easy, I would encourage you to attempt to go kill someone's ratting ship or mining barge if they turn the lights back on and end the blackout. Previously, unless you were doing some pretty extreme stuff, i.e. spies, and log off traps, you could only catch people who were making a mistake of some kind a competent well skilled PVE player was almost never in ANY actual risk of being killed as long as they were paying attention. I understand that PVE is a necessary part of the game, and that the production of ships and modules is the basis for the marketplace, but you seem to ignore the fact that if nothing dies, then you have no one to sell too. It's a system. You could make a reasonable argument that the scale has been tipped too far in favor of PVP'ers, but I actually think you're unable to see past your own particular play style, an ironic accusation you've made against me and honestly believe that ANY non-consensual PVP is bad. PVP is not "CCP sanctioned griefing" PVP of every kind including the non-consensual kind IS THE GAME. Even if it frustrates you a lot. Even if you prefer not to participate in it, that's literally the way it's designed, you're able to be pvp'ed with anywhere outside of a dock. The accumlation of ridiculous amounts of wealth in the game is a real problem and CCP may be too late in trying to fix it, but at least they are trying something. I'd love to know your character name so I could match your specific brand of salt with the killmails that have you so frustrated.
---
The most important thing is to remember to bookmark the other side of the hole, as soon as you jump trough. That'll save you a lot of trouble.
---
It was shared with ccp. As we're most of my exploits like jumping to any cyno in the game.
---
I don't think this one was ever patched though.
---
from the people who still mine but for 5 times the price.
---
the past year null has swung so far towards risk-free pve. in 2009 you would have never expected that in 10 years you'd have people afk-mining 10 rorqs in perfect supercap umbrella safety. funny how the triangle never gets brought up when its favored towards bears
---
Support? that's for peasants.
---
Screenshot of how and where or it didn’t happen
---
#notmynsh
---
Here's the data:  [https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility) 
---
It's open to interpretation however 3-5k new accounts per day seems far too high and likely due to ban evasion.
---
What? I thought all eve players were ElItE pVpErS who understand the nuances of "there is no best ship there are counters to everything" as they keep telling all the new players.
---
Alright, do you currently believe that there are more rich people in eve than there were 5 years ago? I mean, I don't have statisticts to back this up but I bet the percentage of people in game with lets say...20 billion, has gone way up. That's inflation duder, more people have more money. I think simultaneously we're seeing most of the ship prices remain static because we've had rorqual producing record amounts of ore. So we see some compensation that keeps certain mineral dependant things from increasing as quickly as they otherwise would but things that are less associated with mineral prices have gone up, in my estimation, at a rate that is similar to inflation.
---
i'm honestly shocked null manages to lose supers. just stay aligned and warp when you see something decloak or see a sabre on dscan. sure you'll lose shit to 50-man bomber fleets but that doesn't come close to accounting for how many supers are still being lost
---
You wanna fix the BR it doesnt make sense.  Theres clearly more than 3 groups fighting here and more loses somewhere than what you stated.
---
Still pretty far away
---
Can you also add there the issue of blue loot faucet ?      
---
TY
---
Finding myself upvoting test posts more, it’s weird.
---
Capitals are dropped so that the bombers have something to shoot? is that what you are saying?
---
Too many players getting richer IS inflation. If you gave everyone in the USA a million dollars, those dollars would become worth less if everything else remained static.
---
I used to have 10 rorqs logged in daily under my supercap umbrella and am afk until I hear the shield alarm. I pull in the big bucks. I'm doing whats best for the game! These wormholers just don't understand man
---
Hi there.
---
Haha well played guys.
---
Yeap, pretty much.
---
Nah, they’ll make a major change shortly after the patch to divert our attention 👌
---
Who would have thought that making PvE a loss making exercise would stop people logging in to do it. CCP are idiots.
---
I made a thread about 4 days ago discussing this exact issue and then what do we see. Just like that, the answer is revealed.
---
The loki likely cycled off his cloak as he landed, saving him an extra few seconds lock time. It’s hard to stay 100% vigilant but sounds like you almost made it. 
---
Btw if you don’t already (and just use the ship for pve), then fill all your lows with istabs over warp cores or any tank mods or the like, saved me a lot back in the day. 
---
"played everything perfectly"
---
admits in other comments he didn't even try to warp pod out
---
?????????????????
---
Holy fuck, this has happened to me a couple times. CCP what the fuck??
---
Ok. Then it's on CCP.
---
&gt;Dear CCP, this is game breaking.
---
Well what can they do?
---
Client has to know when someone on grid uses the gate.
---
Imagine being you and unironically calling other people retarded
---
This but unironically
---
Nice work, cool to see some dudes I used to fly with in WiNGSPAN on that BR going after Frat aswell :D
---
I believe CCP have stated that anyone who has subbed for 6 months or more, if they unsub, is statistically more likely to resub at least periodically than not ever come back.
---
I get the itch every now and then. Right now I've resubbed to fight in null warfare again, and ill be getting at least another month since Ive not gotten as much time online as I need to scratch that itch. I'm thinking of maybe a 3 month sub
---
Ive also resubed before for mission running, exploration, etc. Depends on what part of EVE is calling for me. 
---
It's a game like no other, even with all it's flaws, there's no experience that comes close. Sometimes that's what keeps me away, sometimes that's what draws me in.
---
I wouldn't have shared the entire process if it wasn't that obvious and easy. I'm pretty sure it's already being used, so at least everyone has the same information now.
---
Your fit is also horrible, best way to not die is to not put yourself in situations in which it could happen.
---
4 stabs means it takes you decades to lock your cans since your scan res has been lowered to about a titan's and your lock range to barely in front of your nose.
---
This puts you in danger longer than necessary and allows people a much larger window to find and kill you.
---
Plus I bet you were never checking your dscan for probes, unless the loki had the site pre-scanned (possible but still) you would have seen probes long before and known to have gtfo
---
Not with op. I don't know why replying to op is redirecting to someone's reply. My Reddit app is messing up.
---
All the bots have left though, it said so on reddit. Nothing to worry about
---
@CCP take note, here we have brains
---
thanks for the info so it  can be abused for the next coming weeks/months
---
\- dont post this shit and report it
---
Cat ears.
---
Good story!
---
I love the 2.8k dps leshaks :D
---
It's weird, but I'm *almost* ok with that...
---
Back in the day fleet battles were largely just battleships and supports/scouts/tackle. The good old days :)
---
well in the scenario you depicted the attacker has the time advantage, which is indeed an OP advantage, but the defender has the location advantage, which is arguably just as powerful, as that usually means you can just undock from staging when the ping happens warp to a titan and get bridged right on top of the attackers. I'm not hating on capitals in my post, what i'm saying is they are (quite obviously) not the right tool for the job (as they used to be until the haw and fighter nerf).
---
This came up when CCP patched out the way that the Chinese translation was patched into the game some time ago. The server sends EVERY INFO about ships in system to the client and only the client does the filtering. So as soon as someone hacks their client they have everything they need to safely bot/krab/whatever.
---
hmmm so that time when CCP said to me that the logs show nothing,  they were lying to me and not doing their job? No! not our CCP !
---
I like how legacy now has a panda express storefront in Detorid, fresh fleets delivered every day.
---
lol, subscribers. "dead weight"
---
I really want it to be possible for a new group with lots of dedicated players to move into entrenched null. I have no idea how to do it though. A highsec Corp looking to move into null, I don't see how they can possibly overcome a decade of structures+cap fleet dropping on your head.
---
You should really lay off the weed.  Those brain cells are not replaceable
---
Wow nice quote. As noob that tried to play this year, Eve fails on all points IMO.
---
lol let me introduce you to the old moon mechanics. Why do you think PL failed when they had to actually play the game to make isk.
---
I'd biomass my tauren shaman for this
---
its pretty much a pattern thats showing, i would like to say though deals broken is often Noraus that gladly break any deal as soon as he can see a short term gain by doing so and not Wind Spirits and they have on off been leading the alliance.
---
not carebears, BOTS had the counter.
---
Carebears are real people and if they know so little about game mechanics surely they are too casual for such in depth exploits. Redirect your hate.
---
Now ask yourself what is the real ratio between player and bot on the server now that we have the lowest numbers? And how does that affect the economy?
---
If its not fun to be in null people wont stay. You strip away the decent isk making from nullsec and what are you left with? fozzie sov, timezone tanking, citadel spam. lots of unfun mechanics.
---
Do you think it being economically viable for a single region to house 50k characters is a good thing?
---
Why not just stop constant respawn? I can still remember times when belts respawn after dt. etc. there was no endless stream of resources.... just go back to thsi :-) ( ok and go back to posses because they didn´t have damage cap and three timers !)
---
Probably would have gotten some if he disclosed this responsibly ¯\\__(ツ)_/¯
---
You need to get out more...
---
I'm pretty sure botters know about this already.
---
no, bombers aren't op. 500 man frigate fleets that appear out of no where then gtfo before a proper counter can be formed are op. oh also kikis are op (blaster tracking with rail gun ranges and more dps than any other weapon system)
---
not that often but annoying enough when it happens
---
munins cost as much as like 8 bombers and get alphaed off with proper stuka numbers
---
It's a class 17 worm hole system. it's usually enormous with 50 other worm holes connecting to it.
---
Aren't these drifter holes?
---
ooh, for a minute there I thought there were people who wanted to leave in independent low sec corps and not under a super umbrella.
---
you need more munin numbers than you need cap numbers and you are on a timer. if you bring 50 munins vs 300 bombers/kikis you will feed
---
Yep and then they got -2tril negwalleted by CCP for their trouble.
---
Yep the very same
---
Something tells me some people already knew (read BOTS). Wait bots are not people. kill all toasters.
---
if you are fighting a stuka fleet, chances are they have bigger numbers. sub optimal numbers of t3d will feed. esp, when they go up against an already organized fleet with way larger numbers
---
Few years ago i used to do C5/C6 sites relic/data sites with sig tanked Slasher. Worked surprisingly well even with T1 mods, battleships couldn't touch me and cans were very easy to open (way easier than null). The loot was kinda bad/mediocre tho. There was soft time limit because the battleships would move slowly away from me, and when they reached about 80km distance they could directly hit me and insta-gib me, but i was usually able to clean out most of the cans. 
---
I believe if i had T2 Logi frig (the one with bonus towards sig) i would be able to tank them indefinitely
---
We need more of this, best shitpost/art of the week
---
The fuck?? Why would CCP trust giving that sort of information to clients? Pure insanity.
---
Oh look! its a goon post trying to further goon agenda!  
---
That's novel!
---
Haha yeah there are def a few folks who a quietly cursing that the jig might be up
---
You used to be able to make a bookmark for any players location when you entered a system, I wonder if that was fixed.
---
Ok, you guys literally had 500 people. let me just form up 300 man subcap fleet as a response in what 5 minutes? no, lol the only option is to drop caps if you want any chance at doing anything before the rorqs die. Not to mention the fact that you have to have FAXs anyways or you'll just volley off the rorqs with 300 bombers while my subcap fleet is on field. because bombers cost pennies. You truly are an elite f1 monkey though good job staying on anchor.
---
But I thought bombers were overpowered and needed to be nerfed!
---
From the numbers it looks like blackout just continued the decrease trend. Until then hey do something to increase content generation and ease of content generation I don’t think things will change.
---
Upvote for obese dino
---
It depends, against 500 man stuka fleets you want ideally only supers and master race faxes. The reality though is you cant get enough supers so you need normal carriers too. Dreads are just gonna die when they siege. Faxes are gonna die against 500 bombers too but that's the whole point of a fax.
---
It sure looks like they lost if you look at it that way.  But you forget that OP has developed criteria of his own: "we won because if you look at days 2 through 8 then our combined losses are smaller and don't forget we looted the field."  I bet he's one of those "fun per hour" guys.
---
Then they should give us ways to make money that are engaging and not boring as fuck.
---
Oh okay I wish there was a BR that said so, instead of a BR that said you lost.
---
It’s a great game for students, NEETs and retired people. That’s not a negative, really, it’s just a reflection of the fact that I ain’t got time anymore. At least not for the playstyles I know and prefer.
---
for literally the exact same reason you are here writing this post instead of playing eve. like, literally the exact same reason. so you know why.  why act like you dont? is it because you're afraid of what we represent? like meeting homeless people on the street. bad enough you know those people exist, worse to have to see them. because it's a reminder of what you could become, if what ever happened to them, happened to you.  dont worry though, everything will work itself out fine, just like it always has... with or with out your input
---
Nicely done guys.
---
gate fire audio event?
---
I just really love how worried they are about your tuition lmao
---
Well good luck finding some with elo emptying each coke stash
---
The thing is, you don't get to choose what to drop. you have to drop caps because you are outnumbered and have limited time to form if you want to save whatever they are on. People have cap alts in places ready to go. whereas people do other things with their sub cap pilots. by the time i form 80 dudes in sub caps to counter this 200 man bomber fleet the rorqs dead. Where as i can jump in 30 carriers and 10 faxes and save him.
---
So basically what we do all the time anyway.
---
Mom, you raised me as a Wormholer, and now I am not able to gank the shit out of that dank VNI Kills. MOM HELP ME !
---
Well good look finding some, elo is emptying all of the coke stashes

have you ever tried to hit stukas with bursts?

True, but I'm a dipshit who's right. ;)

yup nerf fighters again! application nerf, nsa nerf, cyno nerf. But i'm still dieing they must be broken! lol
---
You racist! Calling them cheaters is racist.
---
If you don't believe me, ask Shart Dragon.
---
Well... Three is the charm right?
---
Weren't Iron Crown all purged and banned by CCP or it was a temp ban?
---
Not saving interaction in logfiles on the player pc and take away ingame access to this stuff aswell as encrypting the communicated information between server and client would be a few things they could start with. Not 100% reliable but much more than what is happening right now.
---
that's because eve online doesn't deserve any attention when you play it. It's too boring.
---
Of course I am a fun per hour guy, why the hell else would I play a game? I know shouldn't have to say this, but you do realise you can't spend ISK IRL, right? You're not mining Bitcoin here pal, you're out to enjoy yourself - and this was the most enjoyment I have had in Eve.
---
Several years you mean.
---
exactly
---
I’m a new player doing explo in null and some WH space.
---
Is there any good advice for winning the hacking minigame? I have hacking III (IV tonight) and an Astero  and I seem to not blow up 1 in 5 cans?
---
Well, it is not a rorqual, so you can't blame him for not understanding non-rorqual game mechanics.
---
In evictus we call them blades of ass
---
Considering I have been out of the loop 0.0 wise for a long long time could anyone tl;dr what a stuka fleet is/tactics, vs a "standard" bomber fleet?
---
Shut up, and fuck you.
---
That guy seemingly loves killing explorers. It wouldn't surprise me if he had a faction scram alongside a T2 for 5 points total.

Aleks, i like you man, youre a good dude...
---
this was cringey :(
---
its just a coincidence that after all the nerfs, supers are still the go-to doctrine for basically everything that roams through your space....
---
definetly not because fighter application is extremely good and basically deletes everything instantly with very few exceptions.
---
Atm, you bois seem to be out farming provi. RekkingCrew has gathered enough allied players to field equal numbers or outblob the proviblob in terms of pilots and capitals - especially supers. Across all the TZ's.
---
post-blackout and under a hostile super umbrella provi is even a worse place to krab.
---
Alternatively Seddows Daddy has a mere 759mil delivery fee.
---
And it turns out OP had downloaded the old and dead portal app instead of the new one lmao
---
That'd be great. I suspect this is just the tip of the iceberg, I hope they'll investigate more thoroughly. I think there might be more ways to detect cloaked ships on grid.
---
Also [what this guy said](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cyvq7y/big_bug_eve_client_receives_information_about/eyun42r/).
---
This is actually good because a lot of botters likely already have that info anyway but with it being so open out in the public CCP is forced to act on it (or at least this should be the case for any sane business anyway)
---
Is the communication not encrypted?
---
you know I only did it for the karma lmao
---
I've been in stuka fleets that were hit by bursts.
---
As long as there's some code that gets executed when someone jumps through a gate you can't really hide it from the player. They might be able to make that spot harder to find but it'll just take the botters more time to find and that's pretty much it.
---
Saving it to logs makes their life easier, but eve has no cheating protection so the hackers can do with the binary as they please, including looking at what code is executing or has been executed. 
---
Also the traffic is already encrypted.
---
It's not like you have to stare at the hole. Disable music and atmosphere sounds, listen for hole activation, have overview visible somewhere, do your thing. 
---
Source: I did hole control for a week straight once ಠ_ಠ
---
Took me a second, 10/10
---
What *aren't* massed supers the best response to?
---
If you can't think of anything then maybe, just maybe, yeah they must be broken.
---
Butterfly effect.
---
Just needs a cheesy voiceover 😉
---
Tru dat.
---
that's it! plain simple.
---
How can CCP miss that?
---
They have even more data than us to prove it.
---
There is nothing else like EVE .... so wake up kick your masters and free yourselves from the blue-donut you and your mind is stucked in!
---
There should be still some ways to hide it (the most effective i can think of on the spot sadly being something that would generate unreasonable amounts of network traffic)
---
It is, that was a misunderstanding on my part. The other points still stand though
---
3v1 5v2 , it changes nothing. it s almost the same.
---
Stop projecting.
---
This one (this post) has better lyrics!
---
Welp, that was my weekly dose of cringe
---
Bye krab, dont let the door hit you etc
---
"SPARE HIM HIS TICKS FROM THIS MONSTROSITY"  
---
Goosebumps rofl
---
Only do relic sites, get the rig for it, get scanning implants, get the astero setup for run (and as cheap as possible). Get t2 relic analyzers (get the data ones too if you have time to spare).
---
Or the best tackle: one shot the squishy explorers.
---
Disabled ability to roll the wormholes, blue loot removed.
---
I recommend you go to a place with a local chat if avoiding fights by using local is your thing.
---
If you feel that null should be safe without any sort of investment or effort? I say good riddance.
---
The login rewards don't actually require you to select a character to claim
---
so how long till you get hired
---
not its mangos are friends and pandas are food
---
This isn't a bug. CCP does this kind of thing on purpose
---
Still would rather see FRT than XIX.
---
you seem angry.
---
Yeah, maybe they could do that. Swap blue loot to nullsec and give bounties to wormholes.
---
this has been happening when hunting for me.
---
It's mostly that 2b wingspan tengu
---
yeah lil bit, just tryin something different. Good to be back though :)
---
more likely to get fixed (fast) when its made public vs only 40 people know about it 5 of them CCP and 35 bots
---
But now he is getting Reddit karma, which is worth more then PLEX 😉
---
I only mine gas (huff gas every day) , and ice when buddies come and get a real mining op going, any change to mining is welcome.
---
Points are generally a better metric than isk for pilots and fights. 
---
And you're right about the objective, it was not to win an isk war (who even cares about a isk war at that scale?). Frat did not show up to win a isk war either.
---
Drake can very easily do level 3s. Don't worry about cloak.    
---
5 best heavy missile launchers you can afford with scourge missiles. An invul field, 2 large shield extenders, and another hardener in mids. Lows 2x bcu and 2x shield power relays.     
---
Just go up ever university's drake page for the exact fit. The passive tank on the drake is amazing. She's a great ship. I still fly it a lot when I need a massive tank.

---
Well, find ways to make it more interesting without simply increasing tedium and I'm sure they'll take it.
---
[Stop whining you dumb fuck.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6KKGfIlWnQ)
---
Yeah Pyfa for fittings, runs on window and Linux, can autoload your character.    
---
For skills Eve has their own apps.
---
Null sec has been risk free environment to PVE in.
---
People are used to strategies that work in a risk free environment.
---
Adapt or die. There are plenty of ways to work together to make isk, there are ways to make isk while flying solo.
---
While not exactly there are lots of ways you could do something similar. Small gangs of frigates operate like fighters. And you can bring a long range battleship with you but have them warp in on you at max range. You'd be the fighter screen for it.
---
Oh ye most def. Would say that advantages of range and the most important, when to engage/disengage are massive as well. But ye, caps arent really a good tool anymore, its just the "best" tool around.
---
No they are dropped to make people disengage, which always happens sooner or later.
---
Ye it only took them killing of a massive portion of the game. Yay progress?
---
On this case it is necessary that CCP takes swift and quick action. As someone obeserving and hunting ratting bots for the last 2-3 weeks I can say with confidence, that most simple Subcap-Anom-Ratting-Bots do not use this yet. They still use not yet updated old Scripts that just scan overviews and locals. 
---
Atm I am writing this, I am sure that this knowledge gets implemented into updated bots, that will make it near impossible in the future to catch and punish EULA-Breakers by a player.
---
Yeah because that's what happens when you submit a bugreport without any outside attention. It gets fixed in a couple of weeks.
---
 First they came with Jump Fatigue, and you did not speak out
---
Because you did had enough toons flying capitals and isk to ignore it.
---
Then they came for the Off Grid Boosts, and you did not speak out
---
Because boosts was great for small gang pvp and null bears hated 4-5 dudes in T1 frigates wrecking their 20+ man roams. (Who also used boosts btw)
---
Then they came for the ECM, and you did not speak out
---
Because ECM was great in small gang pvp and null bears don't understand pvp or how to use ecm scripts or command dessies.
---
Then they came for you
---
Suck Shit.
---
This one is unrelated and has nothing to do with the exploit shown by OP. It is in game for a very long time. Your covops target gotta cloak while warping out and if you time it right - your client will see all his movements until he initiates the next warp; from there it will say that they are just sitting in place, while in reality they are long gone from there.
---
That's pretty amazing. Like it's basic security to not provide the client anything because even if it's hidden in the client, people will still find it out.
---
It was a 180 member corp of iron crown that got banned. Those were permanent from what I understand.
---
I can't actually believe this fell out your ass
---
The issue with that statement is that EVE's retention rate has always been pretty shit so it'll take a while for new players to come in
---
these guys always are back within days with new accounts ...
---
Then bring a destroyer fleet against them with your own booshers. It's not that they are OP. It's that people are throwing rocks against their paper. Bring the right ship for the job and you can deal with it.
---
u/CCP_Goliath I feel like this post should be adressed ASAP. EBR-181741
---
Complaining is easy. Actually coming up with well-thought-out ideas that hold up to scrutiny and are easy enough to implement is much harder.
---
Put this man in a straight jacket.
---
He’s too busy choking on BBC in Deklein and gurgling noises from around the BBC doesn’t really count as an answer.
---
This guy has no clue at all, I wonder how he manages to breathe ...
---
&gt; They've either got bigger shit to deal with or better things to do.
---
That does apply to very many people. And yet they’ll be back. Circumstances permitting, they’ll come back.
---
Once you found EVE, once you’ve experienced some of the riotous fun and have geeked out with other hardcore nerds, anything less other than childbirth or combat doesn’t come close to the exhilarating fun you can have in the space between the stars.
---
I never thought of that. That is actually pretty legit.

There are many types of bees. You need the right kind of bee for the job. Also, you will mostly just the large bees near their nest in Delve. anywhere else you'll mostly see the herpies bee or freedom bees (I haven't played much the last month so I'm not sure how often moomin bees are out nowadays).
---
It is terrifying in that aspect, that they created a place that has such a strong draw.
---
I see a lot of posts of people leaving. I see more posts of people saying ‘I’ve not been active in years, if I resub, can I get my stuff back? Are we still in region.name? Is character.name still there?
---
It has a near irresistible lure. And it gets prettier all the time.
---
Youre a hero.

You can hardly call it exploit as game simply give you this information in the log tool.

It is bug

Damn you made me sing this quietly to myself at office. Colleagues are scared of me now ....

---
Have you checked both 32bit and 64bit clients?    
---
Maybe it showed up in 64bit version.
---
Meh hunting bots is one gameplay among many. I'll allow them to take their time fixing it idgaf.
---
Someone is mad that he can't turbo krab and cyno for safety ?
---
It's like you listened to nothing I said. We do. We show up. We catch a few. They bounce because they aren't actually here to fight. We use Jackdaws. Like I said. Chasing them off is easy. Actually beating them is nearly a fluke. Whether we win the ISK war solely comes down to whether that had enough bombers to kill a Rorq before we get there. Boosh anything is broken dude. There is zero commitment for Stukas. Minimal cost. And excellent performance. It is by all definitions, too good. If they weren't then somebody would actually show up in something that isn't Stukas for once. if they aren't too good, the let's see somebody start using something else.
---
But they keep feeding to us???
---
UpVote Bigballz ;D
---
Is this happening on both 32bit and 64bit version?
---
How about CCP giving us some technobabble and tells us that the ebil trigs grrr messed with our moons and now Mining Lasers don't work on Moonore anymore. Now Miningbarges have to fit little launchbays to transport 'voluntary' Minmatar Mining Workers to the Rocks to Mine the Goo and you have to constantly move them on the Rock to avoid them getting crushed by Asteroids.

Whats with the recent spike in c1/c2 goles?

So when nullsec is finally an empty wasteland, it will be good for the game?

I had to sell my main character to actually quit this game.
---
I liked the blackout, and a cyno nerf is definitely needed imo (this exact proposal is a little bit insane though of course). But I unsubbed both my accounts at the end of july anyway, because I'm bored of ganking ratters and there's less gudfites now with everyone preferring to go gank ratters with cloaky shit, which is fine and all I'm just bored of it personally. 
---
Playing lots of Albion and Stellaris atm.

The goalposts are moving already I see.

Next you will say that they don't even have to live.

I wouldn't call 2 mins 'considerable time'.

I still remember of what they said people who immigrated from Serenity. They claim that their FCs are experienced and fought in Serenity. Those immigrants think their game progress is ahead of Tranquility. However, two years later, I still don’t see a FC from serenity considered to be top level in Tranquility.(Obviously China’s experience is not counted) The reality is cruel, After two years now, they need to rely on a group of Europeans to live and maintain their Chinese empire. and more immigrants from Serenity became TAPI PANFAM TEST's pet.
---
You have to opt in for it.

Wow!
---
I had no idea this is a thing.
---
I am extremely conflicted about it. I don’t feel I can support it because he’s a very vocal advocate for EVE. I’m not forgetting some of his shenanigans but he’s at the heart of EVE.
---
He’s ‘the devil you know’. Nobody who comes in after him will have the same passion for EVE, will understand it at the same level, will ‘get’ us nerds. To them it will be ‘a job’. Hilmar has hung next in space with us. At first we hung around in space next to him. Nobody who comes in after him, to ‘manage’ EVE, will ever get it at his level.
---
Be very careful what you wish for, you just might get it.
---
Issue I find with HS is that CONCORD only reacts, its a policing force. So the guy that gets ganked is already ganked by one or several cheap ships designed to fulfill one single purpose. Now I dont mean you shouldnt be able to get ganked in HS, however I very much dislike griefing. That always kills players and in Eve one could argue its even encouraged. The issue here is that the new player doesnt understand what he did wrong, theres just a massive gap in knowledge.
---
My approach is more to ensure that HS is a place consisting mainly of new players. If you wanna be a veteran pirat then you really shouldnt hang out in HS. If youre a veteran anything you really shouldnt be in HS unless its to help out new players. Im not saying restrict it to age but rather make sure there is progression elsewhere.
---
Which brings us to LS. I mean its broken. For instance, its hard to make an easy living there (in general) and you have caps/supers/titans that will helldunk anything of value, and even things without value.  Newer players should be able to phase into LS without them first going to NS. Vets shouldnt really be hanging out here either honestly unless they enjoy a niche playstyle which is fine, throw them some isk to ensure they can make a living as well.
---
So its a revamp of the game Im mostly talking about.
---
Most def, I agree fully. I dunno how it should be implemented but like the first thing that I had real issues with in the game was 1: SP, everything takes so long to train, especially when you are new. This could be mitigated by giving newer accounts more SP and to ensure they get more SP from events. Lower the older players SP gains from them so it evens out a bit, cut down the training time by years for them. If the "endgame" (no matter what path you choose you need SP) is forever locked people wont stay.
---
2: Fits as you say. I mean when I started I googled and googled and even though I got some decent answers it took me years to find the "recipe". New players need fits more than anything in the game and I very much like the idea of giving them t1 frigs right off the bat, I mean what do the corvettes even do anymore? They are by far the worst ships to fly in, I much rather use the capsule in pretty much all cases.
---
Just ask the player what they might like. Give them a t1 frig suited for it and guide them towards their goal. They dont like it? Repeat the process. Dont send them to find career agents and shit like that, just help them. Tell them about the game if they for instance pass a system with history. Direct them to Jita or perimeter for market things. Give them suggestions on fits. Try to encourage joining corps based on a premade list vetted by CCP to ensure the new player doesnt get stuck in a shitty corp. Give them a manual with the most important things to watch out for. And so on.
---
When I say casual this is pretty much what Im talking about. More or less the opposite of being thrown into the lake to learn how to swim. Cause in Eve nobody is saving you if youre drowning and the player that went under will most likely never try the game again and they will tell their friends that its a waste of time. 
---
This is in line with Eve being a hardcore game but its also why we are so niche. The ideology of what Eve should be doesnt suit the gaming world of 2019. Today you have so much competition and you have one chance of maybe 1 hour to really convince the player that they should stay. Make it count is my opinion.
---
you're the one who keeps whining "you little bitch"
---
That all depends on what you do for a living.
---
You can keep it, there's much more where that came from
---
You don't need to win tho. If they disengage you've already won. Just bring a couple of hundreds of longbows with boosher support with you when you respond and start sniping. If your strategy doesn't work you need to rethink your strategy.
---
Dropping capitals to save rorqs are a valid strategy if it get's the job done and people who cried about it just didn't want to adapt. Some did tho and now you have a counter to the counter. Stukas is a valid strategy to counter the current meta. Adapt or see your ships burning.
---
Think alot of them got banned in the last wave but they just came back.
---
you surely mean blue loot added to nullsec - this will basically end the bot issue straight away (since they would abandon the mtus while going away, and if not, they're dead)
---
Pretty sure you can still lock people faster than the overview via injection scripts too

You are moving to wow classic next month?:\]

Bud i opted for quite a while to move big part of the ISK payout into the new version of 'drone alloy'.

I don't want people generating more isk just after delay but materials that need to picked up and used locally.
---
You should be embarrassed mate honestly. Sad to see you lose all interest in making the game better. Just another attention seeking cuck begging for attention.
---
Banning bots has almost zero effect. It may last around a few hours as they are very easily set back up again. 
---
If you think hardware or IP banning is a solution, this is incredibly easy to overcome.
---
But it is about making game better.          
---
12T generated by small group of player is similar 'bug' that CCP need to fix.
---
Good luck buddy ! The Cyno will be lit for you to jump to it once the itch will be too damn intense ;)

---
10/10, just blew my morning coffee out my nose.
---
Ok I'll go ahead and reveal a closely guarded init. sikrit, rip our opsec. Every init member is required to have a so called "ghost alpha", which is in fact an alpha account with a toon dedicated to flying merlin / corm / ferox, for home defense and to avoid unnecessary jump clones. As it was stated multiple times in this and other threads, corms in particular make excellent stuka hunters because they can trade so efficiently, and even if they get bombed who cares, it's like 2 mils a pop. A rageping with this system can probably get you some 100 corms formed in no time, there you have a good counter to stukas, just need a cyno and a bridging titan. And this is just with alpha toons, it's not that difficult to imagine a future where we will need subcap fleets on standby while doing pve activities (I think Provi does that already, dunno how it's going for them tho).
---
Personally I think it's the inertia that fucks with stuka response: we as a community are so used to thinking that caps are the answer to anything that most FCs wont even consider forming anything else as a response fleet, which by the way was my original point.
---
You big bully

I am confused, is it Legacy defending Mango/Fi.Re/Fuelblocks et. Botters or FRT defending IronCrown and their own botters. Looking at Nullsec Blocks atm, tbh, I ony see poopturds and not a single mousse-au-chocolat ....
---
-6000 players lost in almost 2 blackout month is huge.
---
Remember : players are content. Less player less fun. Less fun --&gt; go plsy something with more fun.
---
that usually 10% of the members of a corp scan &amp; roll the connexion to find something while the 90% left do nothing but wait for content to be delivered
---
There are no ships that should be able to counter everything.
---
If you can't respond fast enough, use spies. If that's not enough, get better intel of your space. Where are the active drifter wormholes. Teach people to report and adapt. If you can't, maybe you have too much space.
---
You win by driving them off. You don't need equal numbers.
---

I stopped thinking about my ex wife about three days after we broke up. No good or bad feelings, just moved the fuck on with my life lol.

---
For solo player it s yhe same. Before you find vni, it was killable with t3d / Af. Now you find dominix / myrm, it s really more tankier and risky.
---
not 100 only 90
---
that can work as well - \\
---
in my much-fucked-over-by-reddit opinion the concord has no deal paying people via scc in nullsec.   
---
Nullsec loot should be something concord, or other npc corps would buy and it can be traded as a physical object at the respective stations - maybe for LP, maybe straight up for cash. The alloys I guess would work too, just you'd be competing with the miners over the same market.
---
Take a look at Elite Dangerous' "deep core mining". It's actually fun and engaging! You blow up individual rocks by placing probes. Correct placement increases your yield and the explosion makes a phat sound.
---
It's a lot more than 35 bots.
---
have u used kikis?
---
I prefer people in combat ships rather than mining barges.    
---
Like seriously i don't find fun in killing a mining ship that 95% of times is  just AFK guy that will not notice this for next 15 minutes.
---
True.
---
But it would be unreasonable for us to make the pandas extinct. We should keep some around, care for them, and show them to people. Maybe charge for entry.
---
see, previously people like you would mine in high sec, not making much profit. with null becoming as safe (if not safer) as high sec, they all moved to rorq mining in large blocks, creating two big problems: 
---
1. Inflating the numbers of those blocks to the point when they become virtually invincible, and any large scale warfare is pointless.
---
2. Flooding economy with cheap minerals, making the first problem even worse.
---
from your post, it sounds like the change fixed both of the problems.
---
Fuck right off back to INN, you're going to miss out on the afternoon circle jerk session.

---
Thanks! That’s awesome. Appreciate your response.
---
Few 1000 people no longer playing and all I see on here is people blowing themselves... just wanted to give my insight
---
semi-afk -&gt; semi-profitable &amp; semi-secure (just plain logic)
---
How about we dont change an activity that alot of people like, but CCP does something about all the bots that are mining 24/7? AFK mining isn't a problem, bots that afk mine do. Removing bots will increase mineral prices a bit, making mining more attractve. Furthermore, AFK mining is highly inefficiënt. If you actively mine with a fleet, it should not be boring at all.
---
Yeah for everyone trying to make this about nationality, I think it's more about noraus. Dude seems to view agreements as weaknesses to exploit.
---
What part of "There's more important metrics than player count" did you not understand?
---
Im surprised no one from CCP comment  on this post yet. I remember Hilmar saying “we give to much information to the players” seems to me, removing game logs would be beneficial. Keep the simple combat logs etc, but this. Why does a player need access to this?
---
Maybe people could mine more efficiently (or equally as efficient) by sort of salvaging the wrecks (not with the regular salvagers - or maybe make some really special salvaging tools)
---
I keep hearing the same thing parroted over and over - "is this really good for the game CCP?"  
---
I'd rather the game be filled with all 1,000 dudes who actually want to interact with each other, than filled with 10,000 turbo krabs who  want nothing more than to be left alone in an MMO until the servers go offline.  
---
If you're honestly logging out permanently at this point - when CCP is breaking years of silence and hostility with the playerbase - because you no longer have access to the most mindless activities in the game with essentially zero risk then specifically fuck you and stay gone.  
---
The game has legitimately been in the shitter for the past few years. It's astounding watching out of touch krabbici fucks cry over and over again about how CCP is ruining the game right now. The game hasn't been competitive for fucking years, and people are picking *right now* to start complaining about design choices?
---
Yep. Another point that gets overlooked often. Removing local in nullsec is not the same as not having local in wormholes. The ability, to conjure full fleets into existence anywhere, makes a big difference.
---
Disclaimer: I personally don't mind the blackout, but CCP didn't think/didn't care about these implications.
---
Well, if a group of players invests hundreds of billions of ISK to make an area more secure you'd expect that they can reap the rewards. Instead, you want to make the region worse than highsec.
---
And while there is no non-stop respawning anomalies in HighSec, I don't remember mission agents not giving out missions when there were a lot of them being done.
---
But I guess arguing against your own straw-men is easier than actually discussing. So, carry on :)
---
Oh yeah, it's big brain time.
---
me too
---
Join a better or less risk averse organization if you actually want to play the game. Otherwise, play a game you actually have fun with. Eve has always been a second monitor game.
---
to be fair, people think like that often
---
Too high compared to what lol? Or does it just 'feel' too high to you?
---
Total mass for each wormhole type now have +-40% variation.      
---
Each ship passing is reducing the total mass, but the value is randomized each time by +-5%.
---
Unblue them then?
---
Well, that's region specific. Providence and Esoteria have the good stuff. It also takes some time searching.
---
well the curves are pretty direct.
---
Suggest a fit
---
This dude must have power of anime and god on his side
---
As is see it now CCP changed players online number to people logged in to launcher, they did this yesterday. Or they are giving free SP again?:D
---
I used to enjoy hunting but then targets became less rattlesnakes and more VNIs so I just went to blue eyes.
---
Yea, I think a big part of it was the Serenity was quite a different game from TQ in a lot of ways, and also that lack of ISK wasn’t a factor over there, so that probably helped be “good”.
---
And you deleted it damn it.
---
No
---
All people are automatically opted in when they join /r/eve
---
Just go to anything that says faction name and something, they are safe. (ex wormhole BTW)
---
Do you think that has anything to do with the Volition Cult widoting into Test? Maybe it has something to do with the huge circle jerk about "unsubbing because I can't AFK farm in muh Myrmidon without dying to a 100 man fleet of bombers". Provi been a literal shithole for years - a shithole coalition of shit players holding some of the least valuable Nullsec space (which is saying something, considering how valueless space actually is) in the game for no other reason than nobody ever actually wanted it. What a surprise that when faced with an actual threat (that they can't use a third party local scraper to immediately inform one another about hostile intel without even having to pay attention at all) that the entire region experiences mass logoffs.  
---
Yeah, terrible for the game. Super unfortunate. Those guys were definitely contributing to a healthy ecosystem, and not *literally* roaching a dumpster of a region for a decade.
---
Umm, why?
---
Usually intel holds much more valuable than just another DPS toon. Knowing who's primaried, knowing in what manner fleet is going, knowing which links ships provides what boosts. If I were a FC I would gladly swap one dps ship for said information.
---
Implying [weed kills braincells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10863546/) in two thousand nineteen the year of our lourde. 
---
Come on son.
---
It has nothing to do with “risk aversion”  . It has everything to do with Eve has changed, what I used to enjoy doing is no longer a thing and I don’t have the time to put in the effort to make content like I would. 
---
For the record, I’ve had more fun in this alliance in the last 3 years than I did in the whole time in my previous alliance.
---
Imagine being in this mental state and not seeking professional help and simply logging off the internet.
---
Thanks OP for this.  Agree this is a significant bug that exposes cloaked ships arriving/leaving the local grid.  
---
   
---
This seems to explain some weird stuff I've seen over the last several months, first with fleetmates still being visible on overview at an arbitrary distance after they cloaked and warped off and also a very strange experience I had stalking a guy in a Heron hiding in a relic site who seemed to know when I was on grid even though I never decloaked.  (How did I know that he could tell I was there?  Because when I warped off grid he landed in a bubble trap that I had previously set about 30 seconds after I warped away and was off dscan from the site that he was in\\ -- so he somehow knew both not to decloak while I was on grid AND the exact moment that it it seemed safe to decloak and warp off.)
---
Were these tests done with the 64-bit client?  Can someone test with 32-bit clients and see if the same behavior occurs? 
---
The ultimate solution here is probably for debug-level logs to be written in a secure way, perhaps encrypted with a public-private key model so CCP can decode them but players can't.
---
"EvE is the best game you'll never play."
---
While that may have a grain of truth to it, recently there was a post about the player base growing up, getting married, having families, career and social commitments, etc and that's probably a pretty accurate assessment of the player base who were most active 5-10 years ago.
---
It certainly describes me, there just isn't the time to play anymore but I still enjoy reading about the game.
---
Now there's an interesting idea, though I wouldn't call mining in E:D "fun and engaging". The mining itself is decent but there's nothing to really do with the ore you mine besides sell it or use some of it for engineering...stuff. Nowhere near the depth of industry that EVE has. For all its promise, E:D has a lot of missed opportunities.
---
Then why are you stating otherwise? I mean you laugh all you like but parading that shit with a killboard like yours is cringo
---
Maybe you should find more interesting content instead of blaming the "state of the game" on your inability to coerce people into simply walking into your organization based on perceived safety and power in numbers. Or you could also fuck off that works too.
---
whatever
---
its pretty obvious what i was saying even when misunderstanding a joke example on purpose
---
Soz m8. I jumped the gun with the reddit post. They wanted it elsewhere on social first. vOv
---
If u add some zeros.. :P
---
I like the principle, but ofc the values are way too extreme. Setting up group of botting supers in a remote renter space would get much, much more lucrative with increased bounties than it is now. Even a +20-40% bonus is huge when we are talking about botting...
---
How did the megathron and vidicator live through the torps? Firewall??
---
Great, hope they like the Hisec content. Now to go through with nerfs to Hisec income as the Nullsec CSM has been asking for *years* right?  
---
The fact that those individuals feel as though their trust in a game developer is damaged because they can't safely perform the lowest risk &gt; reward activity in the game indefinitely with instantaneous intel using a piece of third party software is the pinnacle of absurd entitlement in a player base. Those are *specifically* the people you don't listen to when making changes to your game. The loudest voices, the lowest interaction with others and contribution to the game's ecosystem.
---
&gt;alot \[sic\] of people like
---
I wouldn't say people *like* mining, I'd say people *tolerate* mining. I mine fairly often, so do a few of my friends, and it's not enjoyable in the same way that PvPing or abyssal sites are. A lot of the enjoyment comes from what you can do while mining, such as listen to podcasts or watch Netflix. And I don't think there's really any way to make resource collection fun and engaging.
---
&gt;Removing bots
---
You make it out as though it's as simple as flipping botsAllowed from true to false. EVE will never be rid of bots, because bot-makers will always adapt their botting programs to counter CCP's anti-bot schemes. And unfortunately bots will always be better at resource gathering than humans because it's a simple, repetitive task and bots don't get bored. All CCP can do is continue to try and hinder bots (preferably without hindering legitimate human players as much as possible) and give players better tools to defeat bots (such as removed local, less intel, etc.).
---
&gt; I’m going through the stage of bittervet syndrome where I want to play Eve and think of things to get content. I get home and then I don’t feel like sitting around my computer for 2 hours when there’s a good chance I’ll get 0 content after sitting there for hours.
---
This. So much this.
---
I after years of subbing 5-8 accounts, early this year I didn't even just unsub all but 1, but I extracted all but 1. I was convinced the game didn't have anything worth the time and money investment anymore, and I was very close to becoming a 500b killmail (or 2 or 3, however long it took for a huge stack of injectors to not drop).
---
I ended up giving fw a whirl, thinking that surely the area of space where people go for quick, painless, fun PVP would keep me interested and having fun. But many days even roaming around warzones doesn't yield any fights. I thought about getting on this morning since I was up early, and realized there'd be like 10k people online with most of them docked and afk... so I went to do something else instead.
---
I've tried so hard to keep playing Eve. But the game isn't helping matters.
---
Point is. When they take a break. They don't normally take Reddit with them.
---
Holy shit stop posting.
---
Probably because you breathe through your mouth.
---
Sure, I wasn't suggesting to replace more stuff with the empty shell that is E:D, but I found the action of cracking the rock open satisfying and it requires more interaction and some skill from miners.
---
Instead of jumpout, just gate use event without direction.
---
You mean all the out of touch mongoloids openly weeping about player login statistics while simultaneously sitting alone in their dead end nullsec pocket having a nervous breakdown about an invisible 400 man bomber fleet about to kill their 40 mil Myrmidon in a Forsaken Hub, privately hoping the game does in fact die so they don't have to worry about being made fun of for their killboard anymore?
---
Same here. It's good to see others reporting this too.
---
Can you normalize the graph against the price of Plex?
---
Weird flex, but alright...
---
Oh definitely.
---
&gt;Haha wow CCP the game is dying less people logging in! Slopes for the slope throne xD!!!  
---
but also  
---
&gt;CCP I LITERALLY CAN'T EVEN UNDOCK IN SPACE THERE ARE SO MANY FUCKING BOMBERS I UNDOCKED MY ITERON AND FOUR BOMBERS FLEW UP MY ASS IRL EVEN AN INCURSUS SUCKED MY DICK THIS IS THE WORST IM FUCKING UNSUBBING FOREVER AND GOING BACK TO GAYSEC
---
I disagree
---
Ok retard
---
I spent 2 hrs crying about battleship meta on mumble yesterday.
---
Too bad, if they don't want to die then they should be able to gather intel. Going back to Hisec is a great step for those guys.
---
ASP never changes
---
Compared to the amount of players normally logged in e.g. 28k today. 5000/28000 = 18.8% of people playing are day old accounts. That figure look a little high to you?
---
The activities are not mutually exclusive. You can interact with the community and still build things. Pretty retarded point all around, but alright.
---
Look at the retard trying to post memes.
---
Batphone Iron Crown? Those guys need a Babyphone
---
VOLT never widoted into TEST.
---
Let's say every nullsec miner quit mining completely tomorrow - do you think for some reason PvP guys would just go, "well shit man I guess we don't have any ships to fly!" or do you think they'd just build some ships because people can do more than one thing in the game?  
---
Never forget that your alliance isn't special. Any other group of roaches can do exactly what any other can, easily. Where today you see barely alive, maggot infested corpses of once fun and active alliances sewn together into these gigantic frankenstein super coalitions - tomorrow maybe you see smaller, more interesting alliances with a vested interest in protecting *their* claim on Nullsec, building intelligence networks, setting up infrastructure and actual, meaningful alliances instead of bluing literally anyone who will subjugate themselves. Or maybe the game will be dead, as it has been for years, and nothing will make a difference. But frankly, the difference between stagnation and stagnation is hardly worth arguing in my opinion.
---
You cannot logically argue it both ways. Either the game is dying, and there's nobody in space, or there's so many people in space you can't undock without dying.  
---
Pick one.
---
But we are social ... ^(well most of the times)
---
This is something that westerners have simply failed to learn about modern Chinese communist culture, despite all the numerous examples of it:  Chinese view this sort of behavior as perfectly natural.  They do not know any "better."
---
The ying and yang of conflict is desirable, and for them, winning that conflict is everything.  A panda mask approach is common, but the red dragon behind it is always revealed.
---
A quick google search of Chinese student cheating behaviors will yield some good results, too.  My sister taught a dozen or so Chinese students at a private all-girls school, and she was completely shocked by all this.
---
&gt; EVE does not revolve around you - "good", in the context of this game, is not defined by the degree to which something pads your wallet and/or otherwise makes you feel like the most special kid on the short bus. I can't believe that I have to explain this; if you lack the intellectual capacity to understand something THIS simple, how do you survive? How have you not been hit by a car or something by now?  
---
Hey I changed one word and it's a great argument for why you're a total dumbass thanks man.
---
Actually larger entities wouldn't have much problems. They already hold large territories and multiple regions. Besides - their infrastructure (keepstar highways, fortizar chains, jump bridges etc) actually helps them.
---
i like mango, but panda is cute. FC, what do?
---
Big yikes.
---
MONTHS later.
---
See, that is the fucking problem in the 1st place! It should be if they respond to fake log data they are banned within the hour, no time to offload arrests and isk over months.
---
Only full realms are experiencing login queues. I'm not sure what EU is like but in NA this is only a handful of realms, mostly filled with individuals from the  WoW community trying to get on the same server as their favorite WoW streamers. Most people that don't  give a fuck about that have been playing just fine for awhile now. 
---
Probably tin foil hat status.
---
google the rule of 6
---
I wouldn’t have thought a jspacemonkey would care so much about the blackout..
---
Totally welcome.
---
Most? Not all?
---
What did you hold back from them?
---
This can be applied to all of PVE in this game
---
There are very few capital kills under super umbrella if on comms and in standing fleet. Stop playing dumb. The video of the last Vanquisher killed was released and the dude literally tackled himself with a cyno and hardly anything even jumped to him.
---
I mean aren't PL deployed doing this exact thing rn? lol
---
That’s the hard part. People think difficulty means adding tedious shit that makes you hate life.
---
Then ban using the client! Simplez
---
Imagine being so buttmad at a spaceship guild you create a Reddit account dedicated to crying about them every single waking moment.
---
Depends what side your on. Judging by the feed by Snuff, RR
---
&gt; How can you tell people that they should invest tons of time into a game when they can die without even having had a chance. Like the knowledge aspect is just gone and you get fked based on if someone else was in the vicinity or not. I will never agree to something like that.
---
Except you can get intelligence, it just isn't instantaneous and immediately scrape-able by third party applications - you just have to pay attention.
---
With the same animation then?
---
Pretty much, people are more likely to get caught and killed semi afk as opposed to constantly playing. But we come back to the age old discussion of eve having monotonous tasks that aren’t engaging in order to make isk. 
---
The afk semi afk thing is just a silly argument since being semi afk adds even more risk to the game.
---
Wow man sucks that you no longer have AFK access to one of the most lucrative activities in the game. There is a place called High Security space that might be a great fit for you. You can fit your ships cheap and make a tiny bit of ISK barely paying attention while you mine there, and then if you have some time away from the kids you can run a few Incursions and make some pretty decent money.  
---
Or you could get a job, work an hour, and make like 1.7 bil worth of PLEX. I don't want to tell you what to do with your valuable time though. Stay strong brother, hopefully CCP will see that you farming AFK in Nullsec is the right way soon!! xD
---
Mining is already tedious and soul crushing as is.
---
Wormhole connections respawn periodically over time or when enough mass has passed through them. They will then re-open into another (almost) random system. So there is no reliable database of connections.
---
Most wh groups use mapping tools to map the chain their home system is connected to.
---
Also wh space = best space.
---
Nah we don’t need the army of krabs that nullsec became. It wasn’t needed ever it was just a consequence of ccp fuckups. That huge nullsec krab and botting part was just necessary to inflate beyond reason the number of caps and supercaps in the game. Even then the production has always been in excess of what massive battles could ever kill just because of the way tidi works. There is no need for easy null rating to produce the ships that are actually used for pvp be it small all large scale. Krabs have plenty of paradises still they just need to adapt and they will.
---
I mean, this isn't 20-50 people we're talking about. It'll more likely be a full fleet since there are way more people who can fly T3C than capitals.
---
I quit last year and moved on to other,  faster games, but i still come for the drama and the stories, was actually surprised that olmeca got into CSM and i wonder how that happened
---
The targets are more then that if you do more then just hunt anom and hunt DED ratters. Sure it's a bit harder but blops is all about the hunt.
---
Thanks, that looks very useful to find items to trade. It doesn't allow me to track my own profits though, does it?
---
no seriously it’s better off you aren’t even logged in rather than be in your rorqs
---
Have you looked at the retention after 30/90 days? The people who even log in more than once or twice are a tiny percentage of those account creation numbers.
---
Just a couple of questions:
---
Is the drop of 2000 guys all from Goons ? You guys are struggling? 
---
Are the NPC bounty's drop all originated in your space ?
---
Seems to me the most vocal guys against blackout are the ones that look at 0.0 like a place where you get rich fast but dont want the risk that should be associated to it. 
---
I can imagine the screams already as soon the cyno changes hit...
---
Just remove bots!
---
The big blocs are just louder and nothing else. In the end the small groups will be the ones getting problems as mentioned above. In top of that, the defender has even more advantages now which will get big engagements even less occuring.
---
You're right - I looked at another corporation wrong. After they left to do their own thing I thought they had been absorbed by a mega coalitions. My mistake.
---
thanks for your input.
---
that was two days ago you're late.
---
Before I respond further - the content you're describing is BLOPs activity and engaging defense fleets, correct?
---
You do realize this is exactly what they are for. hit and run. They use torpedoes because they are meant to attack larger ships.
---
And why are you complaining, if you chase them off you won but instead of getting a shiny killmail as a reward you don't loose an expensive ship.
---
Simply changing how the logs are displayed or restricting access to the log viewer is not going to solve the problem of information being sent that's not supposed to be sent.
---
Having access to these logs is actually a good thing, because it allows players to find bugs like this easily. If the log viewer didn't exist, the network packets that produce the log messages would be sent anyway. They would just be harder to find. A malicious user could still use those (or maybe even some other ways of monitoring the game's activity) to detect the cloaked ship warping.
---
Of course, any malicous user would have to put in more effort into exploiting this information leak. But any "white-hat" user would also have to put in more effort to find and expose the issue.
---
Security by obscurity doesn't work.
---
The more obvious a bug is for the users, the more likely it is to be found and fixed. So in this case, having access to the log viewer is a good thing.
---
(Also tagging /u/O2jayjay who made a similar comment about the log viewer.)
---
swap the word mining for ratting and you have the same situation, the biggest issue to eve is that you have to PVE to some extent to fund your PVP unless you want to swipe the credit card and the PVE is so boring that gouging your eye out with an ice pick is almost more fun.
---
&gt;So you basically go and have a pod (bot) on a gate/nearby citadel waiting for either of these events and you instantly know if someone on that grid has taken the gate/wormhole.
---
Bots can just use audio matching to determine the jump out effects being played.
---
a dark corner in my mind wants to see the epic amount of salt produced after the first major battle. 
---
it would collapse under its own mass into a black hole and swallow the whole galaxy.
---
oh noes, a challenge. pls halp.
---
Woah woah woah, what I said has nothing to do with race or culture or nation or what ever.
---
All I'm saying is Frat leadership has a track record. Imma just pump the breaks on this whole racial thing.
---
I liked TB but if he said that he was wrong. MMOs are supposed to facilitate a place for you and your friends (new or old) to have fun.
---
You don't form 100 players in 2 mins majority of the time. You have hunters roaming around finding paths and targets for hours at times, sometimes the target is a few jumps out from WH exit, sometimes WH entry is a few jumps out.
---
Extremely rare scenario where attacking alliances wh staging leads to targets system. Shouldn't be krabbing with WH sig anyway tbh.
---
so you actually don´t have time to play the game or any game for that matter but expect them to be ubiquously balanced around your need to generate in game currency while not even playing the fucking game. god bless this fucking entitlement.
---
I lived in hisec for 7 months before deciding to either quit the game or go to null. I got hooked on pvp and lived in null in the most shitty for krabbing null places with Brave since they got evicted from YZ-LQL to lowsec then back to various null, I've been a active member and fc (I was one of the first brave fc to be granted access to legacy fc channels) up until IRL prevented me to play the game the way I wanted, and I had to either quit altogether or chose to do what everyone was doing.
---
I'm not crying over the money I payed for 3 omegas for the past 3 years or because my space lifestyle changed drastically. Fuck that, I still love Eve and I had the most fun ever in a video game. I was just explaining how the drop in player numbers was maybe the fact that people adapt to changes by dropping whatever doesn't work anymore for them. For me it was vni/rorqs accounts.
---
On behalf of the care carebears in null: Touché!
---
Told by doom &amp; gloom players who get nostalgic when thinking back to the glory days before the blackout:
---
On pre-blackout: "Those were good times, local told us immediately when to warp to a POS and dock up. It felt so safe and wonderful, I knew that on undocking my super I would return home in my super, as close to 100 % predictable as a game could possibly get. But now, CCP has fucked up and actually nerfed that very predictability!" 
---
On post-blackout: "Space is black, local is black, can't see shit except NPC, veldspar and profitable ice, as far as I know a bomber fleet has me on d-scan, it makes me shit my pants that null has actually become, eh, null security. Reminds me of other games I've played, the outcome is not given... The only predictable thing left in my life is what happens when I play with myself..."
---
Removing a great deal of people back to Hisec who are unwilling to risk ships to harvest mass quantities or ore in Nullsec is a great way to increase mineral prices as well.
---
On behalf of the hunters who've endured the long era of the krab, adapt idiot.
---
Why are you excluding some dev leaving this on purpose and sharing this info with some individuals from the player base?
---
WOOO resubbing and undocking the carrier.. let the isk flow
---
The balance is make something interactive but also have a payoff isk or ore wise that makes you feel like you didn’t waste your time.
---
But my killboard stats :(
---
A bug can also be a exploit, the two terms aren't exclusive.
---
It would be great if salvaging got some love. Just a note that probes that scanned wrecks would invalidate some ECCM fits that are designed to be tough to probe.
---
Amen.
---
Was the method of abandoning fighters of a Carrier and scanning them down removed already or ist it still viable ?
---
Look up what the word 'rorqual' means
---
Have fun. Remember when you come back there will be nothing left.
---
Its kind of amusing (in a really fucking sad way) that CCP has re-made the 30 minute NPE like 15 times in the last couple years, yet PVE is still 15 year old cancerAIDS.  Its even more amusing the CCP seems to be :surprisedpikachu: when retention still falls off a cliff as soon as this shiny 30 minutes is over and they see the real PVE state of EVE.
---
At least he can recognise heavy sarcasm when he sees it
---
nope, the shocker are 3 months old Komodo-Chars ...
---
how does the blackout introduce a chance based factor to the game? im looking forward to the mental gymnastics on this one.
---
1000 hardcore dudes dont keep the lights on. 10000 turbokrabs do, plus they keep the hardcore dudes fed with ships and easy whaling if you get bored with gudfights.
---
ikr? there´s literally no one in space and all these people who are not in space kill me all the fucking time while i try to earn me some iskies. you can´t make this shit up. letting all these smoothbrains in was a mistake.
---
Did you say flesh ???
---
Just use the logs to show who entered system.. thanks ccp for client leaks!
---
It sounds like, for once, this isn't a legacy code issue, but rather something introduced recently.
---
Not everyone lives in places where a McDonald's employee gets at least 8 dollars per hour.
---
Ghostbusters !
---
Not the issue. Although we obviously shouldn't have bots, you can accomplish the same thing with an alt. Wormholer btw
---
well i gave him second life.
---
Subbing an additional Alpha now to move one of my 6 ReconV chars to it to have a dedicated Cyno-Account. Sorry guys, that then still only 4 accounts, as I do not own a PvE-Multibox ... So I cannot make up alone for all that unsubbed afk-near2-taco-farms that unsub now because they cannot watch Netflix anymore while farming, or go red alert because they now would have to inject an additional Omega-Toon to protect their Main that rats in Super/Titan (Thanks Keepstars)
---
What !?!
---
Whoever is feeding Frat grunts these sorts of messages has a sad sad life.
---
Stop, you're going to make me blush, chief.
---
The fuck is tedious about landing next to a rock, pressing 2 buttons, and coming back every few minutes to make sure your cargo isn't full?
---
Mining is like the least tedious thing in EVE.
---
But you need all these injectors to make the ticks worth it for your Caps, FC wat do ?
---
Tackling is a skill you cannot inject ...
---
holy fucking neckbeard
---
Capitals or not. It's hard to counter a known multiboxer blops force that use 3rd party programs.
---
[I bet the numbers will drop even more.](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Rate_My_Ticks)
---
Is this the kind of cpu "players" you're talking about ?
---
purple head snake has moved from where it belongs
---
That aged well:
---
Noooo, Titans should never track and hit Subs (Goons about Raiden Tracking Titans after losing 1k Hurris and Maels to 80 Raiden guys) ....
---
I swear to God, some of you can't even read. I'm not expecting anything. I just took advantage of established game mechanics that were totally legit and used by almost everyone in null for years before I ever got to use them myself.
---
I love how the response is don’t be on 03 ....
---
I have better ideas to spent 1T isk on.
---
I know this might be hard for ya'll self-important NullSec folks to understand, but people who don't live in NullSec don't really care about NullSec, and most players don't.
---
It's pretty bigoted of you to think of the country of China and assume they are all the same race (hint: they are not).
---
I am not saying there should not be rewards for securing an area, only that the limit for these rewards is too high. If you want to see regions worse than highsec, go take a look at NPC null, because that's how it looks if you don't get rewards for securing an area.
---
Mission agents you can run into things like the mission sending you vs the wrong faction and the process of having to travel between systems/dock/talk to agent/mission gates also makes getting your ISK harder than just warping between anoms.
---
As far as I know, only one entity in Eve has a large enough super fleet to field two umbrellas (three, probably).  Hell, even on deployment the umbrella remains up in Delve.  
---
But as this isn't particularly compelling gameplay I'm not sure how it would work.  
---
It seems to me that CCP and Eve are fucked to decline, no-matter what you do.  That's why they cashed in and sold it.  The only thing left to do is extract as much as possible from the playerbase before it becomes unviable as a business.
---
Good stuff.
---
Did I imagine it or was there talk of removing total mass limits on wormholes being a possibility? Surely all that would do is mean the big blocs end up controlling j space as well, since they can bring unlimited numbers (compared to wormhole alliances)?
---

---
Thanks for the ping, it had already been handled by the time I got there.
---
Giant citizen cabuto is an unadvanced way of EVE
---
I actually checked the br to see this wonder :)))
---
Not that I think PVE isn't bad in Eve, but how would you go about changing bit?
---
Prople who hunt astero's fit that way alllllll the time.
---
&gt;&gt;Client has to know when someone on grid uses the gate.
---
Yes, but you don't have to tell everyone by logging it. That seems to me like a pretty basic software thing: "don't log sensitive information. Period."
---
holy shit you beat a drake fleet with dreads and supers... congrats on overkill?
---
Remote assist Nestor's are no joke.
---
Oh god, does this mean Eddz is coming back next?!
---
jk, welcome back. Hope Eve can hook you guys again like it once did.
---
If you dont agree with ECM please go to the forum where under the features section you can raise your case as to why it needs to be removed. ECM is part of the game. Deal with it or simply just not fly it, but dont complain when others use it.
---
He is leaving anyway, either willingly or by force, just wait until October comes...
---
We've all got these kinds of stories. I have found that its much harder to accept ecpensive PVE losses than it is for big PVP losses.
---
You'll always dwell on the wasted time for PVE but with PVP, you're in "expense mode" from the second you undock.
---
So, my advice is to just get back out there and clock a few 100m. Next time you hit a big payout, get it safe immediately,  if you cant handle potentially losing it. GL
---
I half gave up after blackout.  I don't like feeding and I don't fly caps for PvE, so no, I don't want to offer up a killmail as the "cost of doing business".  Fuck that.  After the cyno change was announced that was it.  I'm out.  All 5 of me.
---
or maybe they did and think that this ability is interesting from a tactical perspective.
---
I love mining.
---
I've got 6 accounts for mining (4 miners, a boost orca and a hauler orca). I really enjoy it and I don't "AFK" mine, I just do homework or watch movies and chat with corpies in another window.
---
I've mined over 10bil of Ore at moons since I been back.
---
Would love for mineral prices to go up. Maybe they can double. ^.^
---
Hey doc, I want to get a dude fired through a petition on the internet with the help of an imaginary community that's so bitter about everything but when it comes to signing a stupid call to action they seem to backpedal like it's some water boat attraction...
---
Praise Bob
---
you are beyond help
---
That's not what I said. I said 1,000 dudes who want to interact with one another. By most accounts the game has stagnated simply due to lack of interaction with other players. The game isn't *just now declining*, it has been in decline for years due to poor design choices favoring less interaction between players. 10,000 turbokrabs contribute literally nothing to an MMO ecosystem nor do they contribute to its success. 10,000 turbokrabs that also *want to interact with other players* would be a great addition to the game. Unfortunately, as we see players unsubscribing because their playstyle is no longer 99.9% safe - it's clear that this was never the case. Those quitting want nothing to do with other players and are a symptom of the greater issue of stagnation.
---
So... Bigger numbers win? Is that supposed to be a surprise? Bigger numbers win has basically been there strategy of every major nullsec alliance since forever, why is that a bad thing when it's applied to roaming?
---
You can't make this kind of activity not be boring. That's literally what it is.
---
you see, to "bore" is to drill a hole in something, furthermore,
---
Hunting was fun yes but now my time is more valuable and I don’t see it as a good use of my time for the risk of coming up empty.
---
They widotted into Goons so you weren’t far off.
---
youre a fucking moron if you think thats all i do  
---
biomass yourself goon cock sucking faggot
---
imagine having no idea who the person youre talking about is and projecting your own faggot insecurities onto them
---
I think it's a contest to see how much damage he can do before he fucks right off this time.
---
And yet a subscription costs approximately 15 USD a month. If you're in that state financially, maybe investing in your life instead of an MMO would be a wise choice.
---
&gt; Not the issue. Although we obviously shouldn't have bots, you can accomplish the same thing with an alt. Wormholer btw
---
Its less reliable though, and how many of them can you differenciate? A bot could put one alt on each of as many gates/holes as exist, and perfectly differentiate all of them.
---
Glad i wasnt the only one lmfao
---
CCP is not going to change a core mechanic of the game. There have been only a few changes that fundamentally altered the way the game is played. 
---
One of the examples can be data and relic sites where in the past it used to be just a % based chance to open a container, similar to how salvaging works or one of those incursion sites where you hack a structure.
---
And to be honest... that's literally the ONLY fundamental change  that occurred... Everything else is just minor UI tweaks and skin changes...
---
Blopsing, camping a pipe system, rfing moon POS and engaging defense fleets. It’s all changed in my eyes. I can still blops with blue eyes but even then, targets worth the risk are scarce and Citadels have changed warfare over moons drastically. 
---
From my point, even Provi doesn’t poke our moons anymore so I feel it’s not just my feeling.
---
That's right, thanks for the correction.
---
Here take this ghetto gold from me to you 🏅
---
You can also hear when a ship lands even if its cloaked.  Its been like this for ages.  Turn your sound on.
---
which i dont understand cause frankly there are much more fun games to crab in.
---
open range  is 2500meters decloak range 2000 so stay 2200 or 2300 just dont close to 2000 and dont reach 2500.  minimum distance you need 2100 and maximum 2350-2400
---
warp core stabilisers NOT WORKING when  someone bring  maulus navy issue,sabre or  devoter [example]  also if you have fitted WCS  your lock time is huuuuge  you should get  sensor booster and scan resolution script and tracking computer with optimal range script &lt;i think because WCS   affect scan resolution and locking range&gt; IF YOU want to reduce some drawback from WCS usage.. i have this on stratios  5 WCS  1 sebo scripted  1 tracom scripted relic analyzer 10mn ab scan rangefinder  and ecm burst high slots  i  dont recommend usage of sebo and tracom in case you need these slots for something offer,i never carry data analyzer thought so only relic one
---
tracom tracking computer sebo sensor booster...
---
you saying you are at 1000m --  gods,you are in suicidal range. stay in cloak range  anyhing comes  you cloak  and get out before he decloak you and kill.
---
Could this be.... An upcoming feature that leaked early?  
---
* Make Cyno's only usable from ships that can cloak.
---
* Make cloak useless.
---
= Increased cost to drop (super)caps, excellent new ISK Sink! Mission accomplished!  
---
@CCPLEASE can I get a job now? I've clearly demonstrated that I am on the "same line" now as ya'll for balancing the economy :)
---
Well yes, but this is just what game shows.    
---
Like how you can call something exploit if you can just look at it and see it.
---
lel
---
And the other 5.5b in losses...
---
ok, tnx for your valuable input!
---
Part of the buyout was he's not allowed to leave for X amount of time.  Since he clearly hasn't given a fuck about EVE for years, he's probably hoping he can fuck it up bad enough that they fire him and he gets to keep his money.
---
Hang in, doesnt the gate play a visual effect when it is used by someone jumping in or out anyway?
---
Guilty until proven innocent .
---
&gt;I don't "AFK" mine, I just do homework or watch movies and chat with corpies in another window.
---
That's pretty much AFK mining, my dude.
---
That basically the definition of tedium.
---
Tedious: tiresome by reason of length, slowness, or dullness.
---
These AAR's are pretty minimal, I unfortunately do not have all the info time time around.
---
AAR: Preds, who are based in FRT's staging system O3-4MN, put up a fake FRT standing fleet. After lighting a cyno on a TEST Astra (the one responsible for a Vanquisher death last month) a FRT Ragnarok joins this fake fleet and jumps to this cyno. A dread bomb is quickly put together and the second titan dies on this Astra.

---
Later this day, just before a scheduled TEST strat op, the same Rag pilot is now in Legacy's new staging QPLX-J in a Nag dueling a TEST Nag. FRT brings in a small 37 man muninn fleet which TEST pushes off. The Nag is then DD'edhttps://zkillboard.com/kill/78756380/
---
TEST heads out to entosis a string of Detorid systems. Meanwhile, XiX and FI.RE tackle three rorquals that the TEST fleet catches up with to help down.

---
Thats not different outside wormholes tbh.
---
If a massive portion of the game is centered around ‘99.99% safe semi AFK PvE for the best rewards’ that is a problem.
---
I don’t think it is actually. I think your seeing WoW and knee jerk reactions. Time will tell though.
---
Logs are least resistance? I know of at least one tool that makes screen watching point and click simple.
---
A lot of people have, but I'm sure there are at least as many people still holding out hope before they pull the trigger, that the changes don't actually go live.
---
Then just imagine how many people haev already quit but have active subs (since EVE used to be the long game, I'd be willing to be most people pay in 3-month chunks or more since its cheaper)
---
Its beautyful, but empty and pointless. Thats why it will never replace something like EVE.
---
What happens in October?
---
No it's not, because I'm at my keyboard and I don't put other windows over my EVE clients. Everything is side by side.
---
Simple, you getting ganked is based on the odds of someone being in the vicinity.
---
Yup bot aits on the in gate to a dead end system or pocket and the bot or player can warp off his alts before the hunter even loads the other side...
---
Not matter how you slice it blackout was a mistake and it's made things safer for bots than players.
---
It s not a challenge if you have a semi competent pilot in this ship.
---
You need to be very lucky to engage a very dumb guy.
---
Because they have "unsubbed"
---
I've had 5-10 subs active for the last 5-6 years depending on how active I am.  I'm down to JUST my main subbed now for the first time since like 2010.  I'm having a hard time even motivating to log him in, so I may just let it lapse too.
---
These guys arent content though. They are the highly risk averse and are leaving because they no longer have a near 100% safety net.
---
Less players like this in the game the better.
---
People in bombers seem to care hard enough to get CCP to nerf our playstyle. 
---
You got any numbers on that "most players" claim? Because considering the many alts that we tend to have, I would argue that most players are us.
---
🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺🇪🇺
---
That's something Hilmtard doesn't seem to understand.  He thinks if subs dump too bad he can just revert whatever retarded changes he pushed in X month, and everyone will magically come back.  Once people finally pull the trigger, most of them won't come back.
---
This isn't relevant in any way. If it's happening, it's bad regardless of the client as it isn't an issue with the client.
---
&gt; youre a fucking moron if you think thats all i do
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; biomass yourself goon cock sucking faggot
---
  lolololololololololol be mad bro. Be mad.
---
I see, momma raised a bitch
---
Part of the $ -&gt; "production" incentive is in fact damaged.  Those who convert $ to isk to buy assets don't need to convert as many.  Isk is inflated, increasing what you get for the PLEX, and assets are deflated, increasing the assets you get from those same Isk.
---
Honestly, if Hilmtard continues his crusade, it won't be long before there's no reason to own sov.  He seems hellbent on making sure there's no reward for it.
---
implying the existence of one-sided coins
---
To a certain extent sure, but you cant do anything about logoffs (much less than before) and its not practical that you would have eyes on every gate in your region (which u actually have to watch 24/7). In theory sure but in reality it just introduces too much tedium for it to be worth it.
---
And I dunno if youve been in a bloc since they introduced the change. Intel channels are a clusterfuck. 
---
So ye sure, to a extent. But at some point it just becomes too much work. Eve was already a second job, now it feels like overtime is required without any extra pay. Its not the risk that makes people leave man, its just the boredom got amped up.
---
So did I :-)
---
*Slow clap*
---
That was already the case in WWB when it was all "Machariels-online".  I think we are now to the next level.  It isn't even T2 hulls that make the difference, but caps, super caps and titans.  Those were so rare when designed that counterplay was never introduced.   Now it is all just N+1.
---
I gave another downvote to underscore the irony, perfectly balanced and all that.
---
:)
---
Must be some kind of moron. They're too good. They're not meant to be. And they shouldn't be. You'll learn to deal with it when that balance pass comes.
---
Yes.
---
So you are just gonna chicken? Because risk averse moneymaking in the (supposedly) riskiest space is not an option anymore?   
---
Go to Highsec and do Level 4's if you want security. Thats what they exist for.
---
CCP should just open up the UI for modding. The whole Interface is trash and CCP is clearly too slow/clueless to fix it. 
---
What do i hear? People will find exploits and unfair advantages? Fuck it, put a 'Chaos-era' sticker on it and tell ppl to adapt and HDFU. If things get out of control fix it months later and don't forget to throw the Wormholers under the wheels while doing it.
---
It's easier now to not worry about logging in. It's actually easier now for me to unsub my accounts when before I would just let them stay subbed and keep training. That way if a ping came out that was important for the alliance I could hop right on and pick up where I left off. Now, theres not much going on besides entosis shenanigans.
---
Lets not forget they formed a new corp and were back at it less that 72 hours later
---
I give it a year or 2 at most before the Chinese groups part of the big groups break off and for up in a Chinese only alliance to basically do on tq what they did on their server.
---
LOL
---
Yeah, you're absolutely correct. However, in that case it wouldn't be audio triggers that'd be the problem, but the extraneous log info. With audio only, I suppose the only advantage would be speed in identifying which client was generating sound
---
 Calling it now it will be a Hunger games event.
---
 All assets in Null citadels will be taken out placed at the Sun in 1DQ1-A ( only because 75% of all null assets are here anyway) , every null block pilot will be in a pod 100 km's from the pile of stuffs, flag will drop and everyone will start to slowly head towards the pile to grab a ship and arm themselves.
---
 Imp will plan on grabbing the Rorq's, Supers and Titans and carry on as before building for the return of Bob. ( Init will be booshed farther away by CCP Karma.)
---
 Legacy will be posting middle management dino in local going for the ratting caps and jumping blindly to cyno beacons.
---
 Winterco will be heading to the VNI stash but will be auto warped to safety before the get to them when the first ship gets boarded.
---
 NC. will pause for a few minutes temporarily blinded by the light then find somewhere to dock up.
---
 Simple farmers will somehow still kill legacy haulers in SV5.
---
 PL won't be in pods when this event happens, somehow they got on 15 mins before everyone else and will be of grabbed Chemo legions cloaked 10 km's off the loot waiting for the pods...........
---
No, it went from half of the systems being empty pre-blackout, to 80% of systems being empty post-blackout.  The fail level broke 9000.
---
I hadn't heard that; it sounds like a big mistake to me.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
We need the whole soundtrack in spootify T_T
---
Which is why caps are dropped. Thats literally the entire point. Its low numbers that will succeed in doing what would take much larger numbers to do. You cant just warp in 50 guys against 600, you would atleast need a full fleet if not more.
---
The issue still remains, having to ping for that many. Certain alliances would have to call CTAs to battle those amounts. And in no way will you be able to get enough numbers to land on grid in any good time. Everything you are trying to save is long dead.
---
wat
---
You are definitely correct that, as long as the client knows, the information is there, on a remote machine, and can be scraped.
---
However, saving it to logs makes this task a LOT easier. Writing a log scraper is the kind of task I might give someone as an intro to writing code. Compared to invading the client's memory and reading out encryption keys or other state data...its child's play, almost no effort at all to use.
---
Mostly least resistance.
---
lol
---
I enjoy the fights out of TiDi where escalations happen and now, they seem to be rare occasions. They do take a lot of preparation and time to setup and even then, its never a sure thing.
---
Sometimes after a stressful crappy day and the brain is fried I just want to take three accounts and mine. Watch the pretty lights hit the rock, talk rubbish and not have to think too hard.
---
The chinese that went to TAPI (Mangos) and Goons (PLA) are in fact the former Serenity-TAPIRIUM. The blue donut that held 2/3 of Serenity Sov and did the main part in destroying Serenitys economy with RMT. The people now in FRT are from the literally "last resistance" of Serenity against the full blue donut. It is clear that these 2 groups also end up in different corners of the ring on TQ.
---
We might be using different definitions of "AFK" here, but I've taken the general definition of AFK in this context to indicate you're not actively focusing on EVE but focusing mostly on other tasks.
---
There really isn't any reason to it. It saves some fuel I guess but otherwise, what's the point?
---
Cultural is not racial. There's a big difference. Everyone needs to stop being such alarmists for fear of being called a racist. It's really quite sad the direction our society has turned in this regard.
---
This is a new level of tinfoil
---
Anyone who gave a shit about the actual game left years ago.  They should have killed it while it was good, I don't want to remember a game I loved so much for so long in its current state.
---
&gt;One of the examples can be data and relic sites where in the past it used to be just a % based chance to open a container, similar to how salvaging works or one of those incursion sites where you hack a structure.
---
TBH I'm not sure which version of the mechanic is more infuriating.
---
Basically:   
---
Legacy+Imperium= NATO  
---
pandafam= Russia.  
---
Russia likes to talk tough shit and act like its a major contender in the arms race, but in reality they know they'd get wrecked in an actual conflict by virtue of NATO's obscene defense spending.   
---
Mostly propped up by one country (Goons) whom form the true backbone, while most of Europe (Legacy) is just along for the ride.
---
I saw the trailer for the new PoE league the other day so I've been playing that again plus I also go back to Runescape every few months to tinker around in.
---
This caught me by surprise.
---
May be true if cloaking and covert cynos weren't so fucking OP.  They're only going to be more so with the regular cyno changes.  Bombers Online is a go.
---
How are most of these precurser ships not nerfed yet? I mean, it's silly how stupid overpowering they are with the tank and DPS they shell out.
---
Lol, Injectors were only to cater towards greedy ass CCP's bottom line while they were fishing to sell out.  Literally everyone told them what it was going to do for the game, but they didn't give a fuck about the game's health, just those $$ signs.
---
I'd agree. It's the one place in the game where you can't just blob everything with greater numbers so hopefully it's not a serious suggestion otherwise the game will become even more homogenous.
---
Then again it's CCP so...
---
I kinda wonder if a Titan ever died to this.
---
I haven't even cared enough to get past the launcher.
---
Which is why droves of people, even discussed in this very same thread, are going back to Hisec right? To avoid the *boredom of nullsec*.  
---
So many absurd arguments. If the game is boring, why aren't you out ratting with the lack of activity? Why are others claiming they'd rather leave than pound anxiety meds? The answer is obvious. It wholly has to do with risk.
---
No ships currently do. 
---
Spies only work to a certain degree. 
---
You realise what youre suggesting right? That more do what Delve does. You want titans on every gate? Cause this is certainly the approach. And if you think space is empty now just wait until everyone just packs themselves into a couple of regions.
---
This very approach is why I vehemently argue against certain nerfs, it will bring about stagnation on a whole new level. And then people are gonna sit there and bitch about how NS is OP and how everyone is just living in a couple of regions, just like people are saying about goons atm.
---
Your name, contact details, address and payment details? Oh dear that will really make an impact against them.
---
Don't worry, once everyone leaves Null, Hilmtard will dig his hands into high sec isk faucets.  Wait for the retards crying then, they'll hafta close reddit.
---
Get a covert cyno and some bombers. They're OP, from what I read online. Should be easy counter.
---
#1 problem in the game, not being able to dock without going from rock solid 40 fps to 20 fps is unacceptable.

It's what you get for listening to crisko LOL
---
I need a multiple cancel order option. I use a autohotkey script because it is very annoying to do 3 clicks per orders in a case of evacuation...
---
I want to see the neocom opaque, like the rest of UI once the transparency slider is set to zero. It would make the UI more consistant.
---
I want the RGB sliders back. I am tired of the black dominance with a touch of color. It was really better before.
---
I want to fix the icons size in the Selected Item window.
---
Etc.
---
The UI has become worst with time. I agree, CCP should open up the UI for modding, it will solve everything.
---
Because this WH has so much use.
---
This could be the trigger for, or logging of, the visual itself since the lines call it an "effect".
---
You're right though - the information to show the gate/hole jump effect is sent to the client regardless if it is logged or not.
---
Pretty much, the reward in Nullsec was to offset the last 5 year of shit-tier changed to actual sov wars.  You only put up with that shit to reap the rewards, but where are the rewards now?  If there's no good point in owning sov, nobody is going to do these absolute shit mechanics.
---
Narcissists :)
---
but why would you think that way. Goons will be able to keep their Industry base in Delve or wherever and just roam the countryside for resources.   
---
For smaller entities might be the case you need to move your industry/trading home with the ratters/miners but for larger groups it might be a matter of splitting it, only.   
---
It will also give haulers something to do - moving things about from the ratting grounds to the industrial core regions.
---
Use words that mean what you're trying to say man.
---
AFK is like putting an Orca in the belt with each drone on a different rock and then you go grocery shopping or off to school. Or a Retriever and you're taking a shower while it fills.
---
I'm actively engaged with the client. Just because I have another window open doesn't mean I'm "AFK". By that logic you've got yourself in a pickle because if I have two miners, when I manage one miner I'm AFK in the other. How can I be AFK mining while AK mining?
---
You're making me imagine someone in a capital sized venture again.
---
65% of EVE players have 1 account, 20% have 2. That's 85% of players with 2 or less accounts...
---
I mean they should probably temp ban it now if retards crying is a proper reason to suspend the subreddit.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4eeewi/eli5_the_t20_scandal/
---
It's happened in the past. Pluasthere's at least one csm that got removed and banned in the last couple of years for sharing proprietary information.
---
Why do you think this cant have happened?
---
Solid gold, I'd pay to see that event
---
It is the nature of a game where the mentality of power has for years revolved around haves and have nots. You either have a titan or super or you're a plebian. It could be argued that people get tired of flying subcaps but I've found very few cases where that point is claimed and there is any killboard activity whatsoever to justify it.
---
Actually, bot still has the advantage because it can watch the audio output of each client individually.
---
In theory, you could do the same by having the OS volume mixer up. 
---
I honestly don't see a way around this without either removing all effects of cloaked ship movement, or generating the occasional random flashes as disinformation. 
---
Removing logging raises the bar, but this is a pretty trivial property to work around for a bot. I feel like the answer is multiple cloaky chars working together, maybe including one or two alts each. 
---
I feel like bots must be using d-scan constantly and correlating, I bet messing around with ship names off at a safe could mess with their tracking?
---
Gallio gallio

lol everyone was talking about that before it started
---
So dark.. are u sure u are not from the dc universe?

Less map info...as in no reports of pilots in space or jumps...only kills the pas 24hrs

we'll they have to get those magic 14 to V before playing :)
---
please do it :-)
---
Is there any way I can set my default to orbit at 2250 instead of having to rotate the little wheel manually every time. Also can you suggest an astero fit for relics for me?
---
Ok, thanks for the made up numbers. They also don't tell us where these magic 85% live.
---
On average data is lower, but on occasion you'll hit a super can. Better to do both imo.
---
Tiger Lilies are life.
---
Well yes, but it also tell us if this was due to 64bit rework - so probably whole 64bit client can heavily depend on this data - aka we are fucked up as you need to rework big part of 64bit code.
---
You can absolutely PVP without doing PVE or paying irl money.

someone being in the vicinity isn´t random or defined by "odds". neither are your personal choices to deal with that circumstance.

Did you read about the hemp prosecution? That all its arguments are something in between intentionally false because of economic interests (chmical industry), strictly dumb and uneducated or just blatant racist against Latinos?
---
shitting on generalised groups of people is the root problem with racism… you can do this based on culture, nationality, whatever – it's not better, it's just not discussed as much as racism, which hooks people by the asshole ( i guess people be insecure about race)

Abyssals in high sec is the new cash cow. It's also more money than carrier ratting in nullsec.

* Unable to determine if you are in danger, no local and nothing shows up on d-scan.

* cloaked ship that was there afk all day decloaks and lights cyno.
---
* Get tackled and 100 bombers drop in on you.  
---
* You cannot light a cyno. You die.  
---
That's as complicated as the equation needs to be. Does that sound like something you would purposely do repeatedly?
---
And that takes longer than a Fortnite minute so screw that!
---
I was  wondering WTF when I land with bombers on \*alliance name omitted\* and people immediately warp off.. once is a coincidence, 9 times in 1 evening while the anom isn't finished isn't. 
---
Thanks for reporting this man!
---
You are literally crying that 50 people can't kill 600. Get. More. People. They did.
---
People have been crying here that they can't deal with all the caps that are dropped on them. They adapted. Now it's your turn.
---
They are literally doing what the ships are designed for. To kill larger ships.
---
Adapt or... what was it again?
---
So basically by chastising him you think he’s wrong and he should assume everyone in China, regardless of race, is prone to cheating due to culture?
---
Or were you looking to score internet points despite a massive case of cognitive dissonance?
---
Heresy!
---
You're really not actively engaged though - performing one activity once every several minutes is not active gameplay in any sense of the word.
---
You're not 'literally' away from your keyboard, but in the same way that you're not playing the game (everything is auto-cycling, and you're just waiting until the rock is depleted) you can't be considered that you're playing the game.
---
You're doing something else, and you just so happen to have some Eve clients open that are performing activities. They'd perform them whether or not you were sat there or not, that's the definition of AFK in most normal minds, you're being pedantic.
---
why should some one form a fleet against bombers bar? you and your kids just run away.
---
why you believe you have the right to protest, while all other playstyle get nerfed and your not, kid?
---
From an amateur dev pov: Reading strings from a logfile is way easier than writing something that utilizes point and click, yes
---
When was the last time you thanked helothane and the white van?

I don't have this issue even when quad boxing.

Best comment
---
Probably shouldn't admit to botting on Reddit.
---
I can only say no. I mean, people dont work that way. You want to simplify human behaviour into something concrete which just affirms your beliefs of a certain group. Its not new behaviour dude, this has been reported time and time again about every group which looks down upon another group. Its textbook us-them behaviour.
---
But people dont work that way outside of propaganda pieces.
---
The first step might be risk (which I dont even agree on) but its not that aspect that drives people off, its the effort needed to put in safeguards. Its simply not worth the boredom it brings. I mean the definition of tedious is when you have to put in more work to gain the same results. And you are welcome to show me one single game which has managed to introduce more boredom and in doing so managed to gain more players.
---
And its quite easy to prove, I doubt most people in NS rat because of isk which makes the entire isk-reward discussion irrelevant. Most do it because they wanna chill or its just their playstyle, having to put in more effort to do it is what drives people to highsec as you say yourself are stating. I mean you are honestly proving my point, why would people be willing to go to HS when the isk is worse right? And you are saying you can mitigate the risk in your earlier post which I agree can be done to an extent. That means that the discussion isnt rooted in isk vs reward but rather in something else. 
---
And that something else is boredom, NS was boring to begin with but with these changes its just a massive undertaking to just undock. And people opt out, its fairly simple my man. Its a game, people wanna have fun. If they cant have it they will atleast go along with a certain level of unfun. But if you amp up the boredom it will cost you shittons of players.
---
Now you can go ahead and continue to belive in the "mythical krabber" that is shaking in his boots because of changes or you can actually listen to someone who straight up tells u that I dont give a shit about risk since I know how to mitigate it and honestly dont care about potential losses. Im just not willing to put in the extra work to do it, id much rather just play other games that dont require a shitton of effort to play. I mean, why the fuck would I agree to that? Whats the attraction? So you can have content? No offense but I dont give a shit if you have more fun.
---
Your group assumes way too much dude, you think we somehow HAVE to play this game, and so does CCP. Na dude, if it gets too boring we will just leave. Which is exactly what people are doing.
---
Is closing the browser and not clicking a lot nk that hard?
---
....how can anyone be stupid enough to just join a fleet and jump to a random cyno?!
---
yea, it's annoying that the loot is so bulky as well, but I guess if you drop it in cans along the way, it's not that much of a nuisance.   
---
And of course, data sites is better than not doing any sites.   
---
But what would you say it's in there that makes it "super"?  I mean a sansha quarry gave me up to 130m per site, difficulty I wh sites put out a few mils at least (&gt;10 usually). Data sites I've seen with payouts like, idk, 100k and some carbon peaking at a few tens of mils at most (like \~20).   
---
Am I not doing the right sites ?
---
l won eve along time ago, buddy so lm not sad ;)
---
You know what you're doing when you're mining?  you're boring!
---
Thank you, thank you, I'll be in Rens all week, try the triglavian veal, it's delicious.
---
was the article removed?
---
Mm no adaption isnt the issue. If certain levels are passed then the game just loses its charm. I dont wanna play an Eve where people only live in 3-4 regions and its just PvE and capitals on every gate. Where everyone just focuses on defense and never fight anything outside of occasional roamers which will also dry up since the defense will be airtight in comparison to now.
---
And before you respond, now its not like that atm. And I dont think enough will stick around if it reaches that point.
---
I don't mean pyfa. What do you mean by their own apps?
---
Or maybe nerf the ship that is the reason for the dumpstered ore prices. You know, the one that mines as much as 4 accounts in the original mining ships.
---
Can always count on Banana to turn up the chink spin
---
Are you a retard? I mean honestly? They didnt adapt, adaption requires that mechanics dont change. Instead they cried until CCP changed things to suit them. And they are still crying, every fucking day on this sub.
---
They have ample time to setup their fleets, you simply cannot do it fast enough. Its not humanly possible. Do you understand this part?
---
it's very heavy, consuming far more resources than would be necessary at minimum to deliver its quite small scope of functionality
---
they've built it more like a mobile game than a mobile app, with fancy graphics, sound, other frills
---
skill management is nice, but i kinda wish they would release a lite version without all the junk
---
&gt;performing one activity once every several minutes is not active gameplay in any sense of the word.
---
Sorry, but in EVE?  Yeah, it definitely can be.
---
What do you mean "botting" ?
---
The script don't play for me, it only reduces the number of clicks when I absolutely need to cancel all sell/buy orders.
---
It is like the one who did the F1-F2-F3 etc before we got the grouping feature. At this time, CCP stated that they were legal, as it don't play for us. It only reduce the annoying input.
---
Just try to cancel 600 orders yourself when you have to leave the keepstar ASAP. It is so FUN to do...
---
You do know what risk means right? You should really look it up.
---
I get great enjoyment from mining, but I also have 10 miners, boost orca and a hauler.  Kinda keeps me busy.
---
Not exactly. Inflation is when production/item generation is smaller than ISK printing. Player are getting richer in ISK and Items as well. Its hard to measure inflation in Eve but theres CPI in MER
---
Everything is more fun in groups where you can bullshit around in comms. Mining in Locust fleets for example is a good bit more engaging than mining in a belt or by yourself in an anom.
---
For shits and giggles CCP could make mining open up a trauma center like minigame where you direct your mining laser over a rock and then collect "ore" that pop out with a tractor beam or something.
---
I am essentially new to the game after a 10-year hiatus, I just started playing again yesterday. What's a blackout?
---
The gate effect is coloured depending on the direction. This is a fairly new addition
---
In before hilmar says working as intended, adds something that only lets you see ships when they shoot you *chaos*.
---
I may just have to add this to another screen though to have free Intel about people trying to get into position from now on though. You know ccp can't fix this. They don't even know what to do with Pos's
---
Just wish it wouldnt have all the bells and whistles so I wouldnt need 3 or 4 apps to make one complete app.
---
For what purpose? Plex /30days sub value is changing much different compared to for ex. ships prizes. They arw two very differwnt markets in EVE
---
You are making the same illogical assumption that he is.  Race and culture are two distinctly different things.  You keep harping on race, when literally who gives a fuck.  Why is race so important to you?
---
I am discussing cultural norms and morays.
---
Honestly, best way of avoiding a scenario like this is doubleclicking in space AWAY from the crate that you are hacking, mwd on, and cloak on the second you see the crate being more than 2,5km away from you. then change your direction (if you need a second or your pulse to calm down) or immediately warp to a somewhat safe spot
---
Also: Don't return to a site you've been ganked on. Sounds like common sense but that would definately not the first time I cloak up on a site I almost killed someone on and he reurns shortly after just to die.
---
What's active about mining?
---
There's literally nothing to do until your ore hold is full.
---
Risk has like a bazillion different definitions in at least a dozen disciplines. Which one are you referring to?
---
The one that isn't even a mining ship?
---
Senior GM Lelouch says:
---
..... the player must be manually sending the commands; if a program is automating those commands for you, then it would be considered a breach of our EULA.
---
We have tons of interesting content. Not sure what you are on about. Our inability to get people to join? We are still growing, just slower. My team isn't complaining. But again, the overall numbers don't lie. People are fleeing the game. Indisputable. And that is bad.
---
I think it is pretty much impossible to create a companion app for eve that will satisfy a majority of the player base because of all the stuff that you have to put in it.
---
Skills (preferably editable), Mails, Notifcations, trading tool A, trading tool B, trading tool C, Killboards (of everyone, not just your own), wormhole chain mapping, industry tool A, industry tool B, industry tool C, mining ledger, fitting tool, PI manager ...
---
... and a literal f\*ck ton of other stuff.
---
This thing would be a nightmare for every app developer and you have to bring it to Android and iOS.
---
As there are a lot of different third party websites out there specializing in one of the many directions eve has, there need to be apps doing the same. Simply because you cannot handle all this stuff in one app.
---
All there is for the official app to do is to find its own niche or to grab the absolute basics from the most important directions to be a simple multi tool for the most basic needs.
---
gate effects are distinct in direction. If someone is coming in, the gate fire is one direction, and if someone is leaving, the gate fire is opposite.  
---
Outgoing gate fire

Regardless of what call/name of the term is, people will be able to figure it out. Say that instead of jump Out, you had jump 1 and jump In was jump 2.

Have you informed yourself about the spawnrates of Exploration sites? And how they respawn? I guess not because otherwise you woulnd't be asking this question.   
---
Lets start with a babystep: The less people explore in the region, the higher the chance the site that spawns is actually found by you. Have you tried e.g. coloring your map by people in space and then choosing the region of NS that you wanna explore in by selecting the least travelled region?

\&gt;  If Synergy is used in conjunction with some other program to automate gameplay, it would not be permitted. G15 "macros" which allow you to group different commands into one keypress are allowed. For example, setting your G1 key to press F1, F2, F3 and so on for you with one key press is allowed (although this specific command is not as useful as it was before now that we have weapon grouping).  
---
\&gt; An exceedingly complex G15 macro which would effectively automate gameplay, such as mining, without a need for the player to be present at his keyboard would be against the EULA, regardless of whether the player utilizing said macro is sitting at his keyboard at the time!
---
Now tell me how I automate the gameplay by asking said script to stop my trade orders, because there isn't any "Cancel All" button ?
---
Elite Dangerous got mining right as an active activity, and cracking open roids with mining charges is pretty cool
---
I gave them everything of substance. I did not give them the scripts which would block their ability to stream code to my client (used for anticheat and bot/injection detection).

For technical reasons, we would like you to transfer all of your ingame belongings to Vixxy Koskanaiken, since we cannot remove your information before there are no more ingame items associated with your account (this would prevent us from actually deleting said information). Thanks for your understanding and fuck off already mate, noone cares.
---
Sounds like everyday J-Space Life. Maybe you are just a little soft?
---
I've hit a data site with several ~10m cans and a 40m can. Relic seems to have a much better standard value, but data occasionally gets a bling roll.
---
Yes i agree. Nerfs in excavator yeld like 2 times? ( maybe more dont remember)
---
Anomaly spawn timers. (Killed smartbomb ratting)
---
And a lot more. But this is still only rebalance of game. Blackout is rebalancing too.
---
But is there any chamge that forced players in null to attack each other? No.
---
They can sit as long as they want in their region.
---
For now we would need to have overpopulated regions to get some allianses to push somewhere. But thats never gonna happend.
---
For now every war is ridiculous for ex. Last Tribute burn. What defenders lost? Almost nothingas well as atackers. Why mechanics embrace something like this... I think this is bad for EVE and causing stagnation.

Only small pvp groups now are getting fun but there are no big conflicts.

Nope, last year we saw literally the biggest war eve online had, with 3 engagements that rivaled b-r in terms of assets committed to the field, in two fronts between two giant armadas, yet the media outside of the game gave no shits about it.
---
I stand corrected, thanks!
---
TRI harder.

When nobody deploys nobody cares.

Eve makes their own app on mobile you can use to manage queue. Sure they're is 3rd party one as well just do a google search.

How about the ability to merge used laser crystals when you repackage? It's really annoying to have cans with hundreds of scorch s and imperial navy multifrequency m and what not.

This was a big holiday weekend in the USA. It is considered the last weekend of summer. I don't think you can accurately use these numbers.

The worst example is if your alliance went on deployment, and you missed the moveop home due to real life or something.

I had to drop sub in 2016 because I was broke IRL, and all my stuff was left in Saranen for 3 years. When I resubbed I gathered my stuff into 2 jump capable ships, and burned down to Delve over the course of 4 days with some stuff rather than have to start all over again, which might mean not returning at all.
---
After the patch that action might cost me 2.4 billion in just cyno ships, would have said "fuck that" and never resubbed.
---
I've never seen a cyno light up in jspace. Also, does that sound fun to you?

True but with fully upgeaded sys. You are getting. Like 30-40 ratting anomalies.(sould be enough for 10-20 players to rat a day) + mining anomalies
---
Colossal about 5b isk 5h spawn
---
Enormus about 4b isk 4h spawn
---
And theres large medium and small too.

And you can have it in every sys. 🙂 + Moons.

Even Delve now have a lot more room for more players.

Before titans. My account was created in 2k5. I was active alliance pvp with some breaks in between from 2k5 to 2k11. It was a different game pre-cap. Titans had just come out but seeing one in the field after that first one was downed was rare, and a dread in a fight was still a holy shit moment.

No its not.  Can you do homework while playing COD.  You literally stated the definition of afk mining while saying you dont do it.....
---
This is just humiliating.
---
You don't need a Cyno in Jspace, people come to you the traditional ways. 
---
In general, I have not "needed" a Cyno in my life. You can live pretty well completely without ever using one. 
---
And no, ofcourse it doesnt sound fun to me, just like any other kind of pve doesn't sound fun to me! I'm here for the PVP, which is why I eventually gave up Jspace ratting (before knowing what I was missing out on by not doing Pvp however, I did enjoy exactly that danger. Made things more interesting).

Windows 10 had its audio framework rebuilt, you can easily extract the audio channel per app now.

Eve University

Dark Souls 5 intro?
---
All this whining about no content and here i am in Lowsec finding content daily. Randoms, Wormholes, and other things going on.  This game is quite dynamic but if you wait for CCP to provide you content instead of going to find it or creating your own, you'll forever be bored.
---
This is literally the best part of the game.
---
I think this would have big groups controlling the two surrounding areas and basically doing a crop rotation every month.
---
So you are still reliant on pve players to pvp. Weird how that works
---
Then at the very least it should be an activity that's exceedingly hard to automate.
---
The what spin?
---
This! Should i stare at my mining lasers for hours? Even in ratting you have a lot of waiting time. In EVE PVE you spend so much time waiting for something, that you almost have to do it half-AFK if you dont want to waste a lof of (life)time.
---
I also sang it in my head while reading ;-)
---
This is something we're currently looking at, thanks for the additional heads up :)
---
Dear /r/Eve,
---
this week I logged back in after some long, nice summer vacations. WTF this game is about spaceships?
---
I'm pretty sure I called them out in my goodbye thread.
---
The point is it maybe enhances your Intel not by like 30 seconds and not much more.. its not really a game breaking bug imo
---
The blueprint copies for boosters come from guristas and Serpentis lip stores as far as I know. They are between 5 to 30 mil on the market for a 1000 run usually.
---
none of them
---
go to wormholes 
---
nullsec is fucking miserable
---
Thats the beauty of Jspace, its not just 2 or 3 boring static entries. Randomly spawning jspace holes create opportunities for the exact same end result, a fleet that your ship cannot handle on top of your face, without you properly knowing how or when that happened.
---
Heck, sometimes not one but five or 6 entries spawned overnight, you can never be 100% sure that your hole isn't populated by someone else. Which is exactly where the fun and the risk is at (and why you get way more money than for example in level 4 missions)
---
Nullsec has been way too easy for years, which is why its so hard for you to adapt.
---
Which leads us back to the start. If you don't wanna get dropped by 200 people, move to a region where its borderline impossible. Like Highsec
---
"its clearly not meant to exist"
---
Be careful of what you ask for, again, you may just get it, along with a host of other unintended consequences.
---
And don't tell me you can just put a scout on every hole Hurr Durr. Init managed to smuggle like what, 300 people into a hole? Shits definately possible.
---
In my headcanon Alek really is incredibly intoxicated while he makes this.
---
I mean people do log out in holes all the time. Either they scan out a hole when they log in, they have more than one account/player logged out in system, or they solo drop you.
---
In two of these cases the only warning is a small blip on D-scan at best, and in the other it relies on rolling connection before hand (which does happen).
---
I was in Brave Newbies back in the day, they're bunch of good dudes. I highly recommend them.
---
All of what you said doesn't change my question: Would you personally find it fun if a dude decloaks next to you and lights a cyno and 200 dudes gang bang you? (Bonus points in two weeks when you don't have a defensive cyno)
---
200 people log out in wormholes regularly? Didn't know that.
---
Since when is afk mining against the rules?
---
I'm just going to point at Elite Dangerous, they have conventional mining but also active mining that keeps you moving and engaged with higher paying rewards not to mention explosions. It can still get boring but it is an active process, I'm sure a version can be made for Eve as something similar was demo'd in the past. Take veldspar say you crack the astroid as an example you'd get a more compressed version inside making profits and resource extracting slightly higher.
---
Tbh yeah sounds pretty cool. Atleast more exciting than just 2 or 3 dudes taking forever to fuck you up. 
---
But honestly... I don't really care about your question. It is clear you do not want to risk your ship for making more money, so stop whining and adapt.
---
Bullard was bad enough when it had local. Honestly just sucks to play there atm outside of big groups. :(
---
It was pretty clear from your double wall of texts that you were going to actively seek to not answer in a genuine manner.
---
well if you think about all the people complaining about the afk aspects of the game, this mechanic made it at least a little bit more interactive than just targeting a structure and cycling a module until it succeeds.
---
So, is there really no point in trying to be a Miner without Omega status?
---
I can't imagine I can farm enough for PLEX as an Alpha, but I'm new to the game, so maybe I have missed... lots of things.

200 is not typical, but you don't need 200 people to gank things so that is a specious argument at best. 200 people is gross overkill for essentially all gank targets, and you mostly see it because people like to whore on killmails not because it actually takes that many people actually kill things.
---
By your definition, 99% of so called 3LLT  PVPrs are AFK; as they sit and wait, doing nothing till the FC tells them which key to press, being that F1 is something the FC cannot do for you while he warps you all over the place.  Your just there for the ride until he needs you to lock up the broadcasted target and  press F1 for him.
---
AAR: I did nothing but jump to cynoes and pressed few buttons. Hunters and intel people did the work. Krabs etc dieing in fire. 2/3 main characters ran out of sub today. Maybe something interesting happens that gives reason to sub again.
---
So common speech it is then. Which brings us to the point i was trying to make in the first place. You´re confusing chance (or more accurately probability) with randomness. They are not the same and CCP certainly hasn´t introduced any probability based element to the game by removing local. The probability of someone showing up to gank you is defined by a bazillion factors, the overhwleming majority of those are player dependend. Neither did the removal of local introduce an element of randomness.
---
What is this mechanic change you're talking about? What change happened in the last 6 month that made bombers together with booshers and logi so overpowered?
---
I mean, I'm not disagreeing that fleet PvP is fairly low requirement in terms of skill, but you still have to jump gate occasionally or align. It's not rocket science but it's hard to do it fully AFK but I'm sure people still watch Netflix doing it.
---
The fight itself is definitely not AFK though even if it's just pressing one button and locking targets.
---
Well tbh you would never really know if they even bothered to actually delete all your data.  
---
Anyway...

Then I guess you don't mind if they nerf how much yield you get to about 1/5th of what it is now? I mean, you just want to relax.
---
Those corps you mentioned are so big, nobody cares about you really.
---
Try join a smaller one where people actually can help you, advise you.
---
Fleet Muninns going 2600 m/s with good agility should really not be getting bombed.
---
FTFY
---
&gt; If your in null and aren't happy being turbo dropped when you undock it's probably a good thing you quit TBH.
---
Just wow...
---
good
---
Would be kind of hard to do with how EVE works, but E:D nailed mining imo
---
Scan rocks in huge belts for minerals, aim for weakspots to shoot bombs that drill into the rock (with a minigame where you need to charge at the proper power to not make the whole rock explode too hard and lose minerals), then make everything explode and collect the minerals flying around.
---
The sound, the visual, finding a big haul, so satisfying :3
---
NEET?
---
I see you post here a lot. Your a literal salt mine kid. I mean look at your name for fucksake lmao. Please spend more of your sad little existence crying harder, you look cute with a tear in your eye
---
If you define PvE players as players that PvE exclusively than the answer is no.
---
A few buddies of mine not long ago started Dark Venture Corporation
---
It's a newbro friendly learning oriented group that lives in a wormhole (a C2 with static C3 and HS, logistics are really great). There's some really great people among them.
---
It's a lot more smaller scale and tightly knit in wormhole space, your actions make a difference even at a starter level. I highly recommend it.
---
Its all relative, whether its shooting rocks, shooting little red crosses, or being a f1 monkey, there is some, interaction by the player with the keyboard, none of which are truly (AFK) just degrees of time between keystrokes/mouse movements.  Even in major fleet battles, Agasaki, B-R, MO-, ULAX as an example, there was plenty of time to make hot pockets, order pizza, go out with the girlfriend to a movie, take a dump, and still be considered (active) at the game.
---
Tested, can confirm you hear the sounds of warp in/out on cloaked ships if you're paying attention.
---
Should I avoid anything with integrated graphics?
---
It's just a metric for inflation, you could also use one of the standard metrics given in the monthly reports from CCP also would make more sense I guess yes. It would just show dollar value destroyed instead of idk (ofc it won't account for Plex sales discounts etc)
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
My guess is you spammed the wrong key. The D key is due warping and then docking or gating and will not work if trying to warp to a planet or bookmark. The S key warps you to any warpible entity.
---
So carriers have always been working the same way they are now?
---
I don't use keys, I use the overview. Maybe I should start using keys.
---
Join Eve university or a small/medium corp if u actually want to learn the game.  
---
Join null sec alliances if u wanna be shouted at all day by mouthbreathers and press F1 and call it pvp.
---
maybe try hunting yourself. ofc only pingwarrioring, jumping to cyno and hitting f1/2/3 is boring.
---
I hear Eve will run great on a Samsung Note or a S10... maybe even a LG V40 or iPhone X
---
You guys all have phones right? please clap
---
Because people want to join NOT because they need that many
---
You're in test. Every system in esoteria has at least 59 structures. Drop your loot there before attempting another site. Then pick it up again when moving on.
---
socializing with peoples while mining is extremely fun and relaxing indeed
---
2 days later: loki pewpew op podded back to jita
---
I would suggest KarmaFleet.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Karmafleet/
---
Eve Jobs has plenty of others looking to recruit pilots.
---
You can find some other corps on /r/evejobs 
---
Pick what's right for you and have fun. GL
---
I blame Keithstone
---
You need to experience everything once in life
---
I didn't really think much of it. I was heading towards D-P to drop my loot and I was like 6 Jumps away and I had done like 7-8 relic sites in the past 30 minutes so I thought I was safe.
---
Removal of the overview is a change I would welcome
---
nope its not, AFK is not being there at all. Know the difference
---
None. But if you have to: either Brave or Eve University.
---
meh
---
Hunting krabs for just hunting krabs isn't my idea of fun anymore. Maybe if there's idea as burning the sov as end result...
---
I know my AAR might have come out wrong but I meant it partly as humor.
---
You do realize you are debating with someone that is willfully misunderstanding you, right?
---
Shocking amount of supers. when you consider what the final tier ship class is in a game that's been around 16 years it truly is a shocker
---
AFK = AWAY FROM KEYBOARD
---
he isnt AWAY from his KEYBOARD, so he is NOT AFK.
---
Sophisticated REEEE detected.
---
If you do frigate runs you get 3x loot.
---
That was pretty much my point!
---
or maybe better, make a capital mining ship instead of rebranding the rorqual to be the mining ship
---
Commenting so I can find this later
---
oh i know exactly what OP is saying, and its basically based on his opinion only.
---
Oh wow I always joked that TAPI was retarded but I didn't know they actually had mentally challenged members. Makes sense that a large organization would have diversity. Bless your heart.
---
I'm unsubbed on all 5 accounts, zero to do with Black Out, more to do with personal issues - seeing a number of other comments here saying the same, from a small percentage of the player base - my guess is we are all feeling the pinch of increased prices elsewhere, and luxuries like 50 quid a month on a computer game go first.   
---
First rule of statistics: Correlation does not equal causation.
---
That Panda pilot, probably have more  ISK than Legacy combined :D
---
They can't even run bots well, there have been multiple times when I've encountered a bunch of procurers in their space that don't even warp off when you start shooting them
---
Hilmar made a super vague statement about shaking up wormholes and peoples knee jerk reaction was "OMG THEY'RE REMOVING MASS LIMITS!" There's zero actual mention of that and it's a terrible idea. Plus just because Hilmar says things doesn't mean they're going to happen. If they did titans probably wouldn't exist.
---
You must not be in Goons.
---
you can active mine. Use the ore scanner more often, cycle your lasers more often for maximum efficiency. If you are really, REALLY want the most efficiency out of an account mining, you have to do stuff every 30-60 seconds. In my opinion, that is active mining
---
Nice. Thanks, hope this will be dealt with soon :)
---
This sub is quite fun sometimes, so I won't stop reading it. But test posts really became cancer
---
Just add a minigame to it, like hacking. Perhaps something like the mining minigame in the 4th pokemon game: [Mining minigame](https://youtu.be/jqNkMlASJIY?t=152)
---
Instead of fossils and gems you have to unearth ores/ice. Skills give you more "health" until the whole thing collapses, increase the average amount of ores hidden or the amount of m³ gained for each uncovered ore.
---
Does that distinction change what I said?
---
Oh man, the real QOL change that we all need
---
EVICT SMA again!!!
---
This really sounds like "adapt or die" to me. 
---
*Who's a salty boi? Who's a salty boi?? You're a salty boi!*
---
Look who´s talking.
---
Horde is more newbie exploitative than friendly these days.
---
Exploration bots being more common makes sense now, if this is a newer bug
---
Gatecamping is = AFK Mining. Actually mining requires more active play, targeting more rocks in the same amount of time...
---
And?
---
And what?
---
Done in by the ole BBC
---
Exactly.
---
Using a phone with 5 year old hardware? Not to be mean but you shouldn't be surprised here.
---
This \^\^
---
Pls no
---
I m the FC of Chinese allies at this fight
---
You all are good fighters and you fight well
---
But i think your members said some  politically sensitive topics at local is not honorable

 Looking forward to meet you at new eden next time

O7
---
They’re likely related. The only reason why a developer would choose to make anything client authoritative in any way in 2019 is if they cant/don’t want to go do it on the server side.
---
A thing to note. Classic wow was released last week and it would surprise me if that didn't at least have some impact on login numbers of Eve.
---
No, because you are simply ignoring what I am saying anyway. They could have 50 people or 1000 people and it makes very little difference here.
---
YOU CAN NAME CLONES???  Holy shit, TIL. If this is real, thank you
---
On the contrary, there will always be people to help because there will always be someone online with the ability to help.
---
This Sunday someone newbie asked a question about salvaging in mumble, he got a dozen salvage destroyers and MTUs gifted in staging, then someone else offered to use their carrier to move them to a ratting system where yet another person was super ratting to provide a constant supply of wrecks.
---
1DQ, GE-8 etc offer well stocked markets and relatively cheap and regular JF services where newbies can source their own needs without relying on some else to supply stuff for them.
---
No, they are uncertain whether or not their activities are going to be nerfed, so they are choosing to bail while they can.
---
people use ventures and other industrials in other parts of EVE, it's not just high sec.
---
Out of curiosity what are the SRP rates in GSF? I really don't why people need 15 rorquals  to fund their fleet PvP. Or maybe you do need them to have 15 faction fortizars in 1DQ just to flex.
---
Dear Sir or Madam,
---
Refreshing content. Please accept my courteous felicitations in the form of an upvote.
---
Sincerely,
---
Etc, etc
---
Remove them as well
---
As usual, with CCP changes, they hit the wrong points. Honestly I don't know why people in rorquals give up already. Rorquals are still very safe with the p.a.n.i.c. and you can just use cheap drones to avoid the excavator losses.      
---
What blackout killed was the safety for subcaps, carriers and excavator drones. Two of these are not used by the big industrial guys but by our newbies and people who can't afford a super yet.    
---
The coming cyno changes may kill super ratting, but that's still not targeting the rorquals.
---
Although I'm appreciative of your efforts to bring this issue to light, I think your choice to disclose this on Reddit, rather than privately to CCP, is irresponsible. The proper thing to do would have been to privately report this to CCP with the caveat that you will go public after a certain amount of time. 
---
Now cloaked ships will be useless until CCP fixes this, which means that I'm likely die of old age before this problem goes away.
---
I see people didnt mention this, but seeing as an empty area has a relic site scanned and abandoned 2 systems behind, you could assume the loki had already finished bookmarking the sigs and started hacking them while waiting for a fly to fall. And here you are, flying by carelesly..
---
agreed, not too rare :P
---
FRT doesn't make propaganda and narratives. (Or drop morale keepstars that have no useful range to pretend they made progress in a war that has been going a long time where they have not)
---
It doesn’t need to be “less boring.” Most activities get boring after lots of repetition. It needs to be less scaleable and individually more lucrative. 
---
Excavator drones should have been Excavator Fighters.
---
T2 or faction pulse phantasm. Low grade crystals. 3 or 4 heat sinks. PDU. Blue loot medium shield booster. 2x adaptive shield reinforces. T2 Boost amplifier. 1x dirty little AB.
---
Tracking/dmg drugs if you feel like PVPing (you can kill any Gila)
---
You can't sneakily take the gate though.  You're going to be decloaked, and the gatefire animation is going to play.
---
This isn't nearly as game-breaking as the one in the OP.  It's a slightly more convenient way to get information that the client must have for the game to behave properly.
---
The numbers are from CCP Quant.
---
And 75% of characters are in HiSec.
---
All this information is from CCP and *quite* easy to look up.
---
As a diplo I have found out this the hard way
---
Hey, I lost two 1.2bil RR Nestors in a Trig invasion system today. Don't worry, get back on the horse, it'll be fine.
---
The client must take an action when someone uses a gate - it must play the gatefire animation.
---
Thus it is not possible to hide it from the client.  Putting it in the logs makes it much easier to detect, but it's not possible to hide.
---
That’s such a specious argument. OFC some things require more attentional resources than others. Your point is... what?
---
Well you reduce the spawn rates
---
Since they are different animations being played by the client, the non-log version isn't that much harder.
---
50% of my characters are in highsec. It's the 50% trash alts and 1 Jita trader. That doesn't make me a 50% highsec player though.
---
I will say you are active mining if you:
---
* Are always aligned to a warpout spot at 75% speed and are changing alignments sometimes to prevent getting out of asteroid range.
---
* Keep track of ore quantities with the ore scanner and cycle lasers down for optimal mining crystal usuage (best to have auto-repeat off)
---
* Have auto-repeat off on your boosts and start them manually to preserve charges.
---
Everything else: You are just watching modules cycle and move ore until you leave the belt.
---
While i do not commend such dialog, i still suggest you grow a thicker skin about that. Welcome to the world of freespeach!
---
&gt;You cannot logically argue it both ways. Either the game is dying, and there's nobody in space, or there's so many people in space you can't undock without dying.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Pick one.
---
Its a chicken and egg problem. But generally the hunters come after the ratter. The hunter can see npc kills or mining activity on the map and go roam to check it out. The krab knows this, so wont bother to undock and light up the map if the risk isnt worth it. 
---
Generally this means that less krabs undock, and when they do, its in less valuable ships. If there is no way to avoid an engagement, there is no point in just feeding. 
---
This is the same issue as blueballing fleet fights. Why undock into a slaughter if you can easily avoid it entirely and cut your losses?
---
I’m not being pedantic, you’re just *wrong*. You also sound like you’re offering a criticism of mining mechanics more than you’re making the argument that by actively managing 6 mining accounts, I’m “AFK mining” just because I have Netflix or some reading in another window.
---
&gt;setting log viewer to higher than warning on my device really killed performance.... probably a Linux thing
---
Nah, it's a disk drive thing.  Proper logging requires writing the message and flushing it to disk before letting the client move on.  Otherwise debugging crashes can end up being much harder.
---
Farming ore for Plex on a single account is not really a thing.
---
Always
---
Yeah I Renamed it to TRAINING CLONE!!!
---
if i could bring 500 battleships (and not get absolutly hyperdunked by bosons and haws) i would...
---
Don't join them. Find a corporation that does things you're interested in and join it. Give them 2 weeks. If the atmosphere is cool - stay. If you don't like it for whatever reason (unjustified taxes, toxic atmosphere, incompatible timezone/characters/interests etc.) - leave without a second thought. Even as a newbie you're very valuable and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
---
If you join a large 0.0 corp all you'll achieve is becoming an isk farmer/f1 monkey. Sure, you'll be able to earn enough isk to plex your accounts but this is an excellent way to not ever enjoy eve.
---
Underrated comment. When you're new you log in all the time. As time goes on "playing" EVE more and more involves out of game tools and 3rd party communication software. Eventually you're so immersed in the metagame you barely need to log in at all.
---
 Yep. Too little genuinely fun stuff happening, especially without having to schedule your life around eve in order to be available when something does pop up, to justify much investment in the game.
---
I know that some folks reply to posts like these with, "plenty of content where I am" or "you just need to do _____," but fuck that. I don't care if someone else is content with one good brawl every few days or an average of 2 good FW frigate fights per hour or one super battle every 5 months. Grats to the fee thousand folks for whom that is entertaining enough to stay active in Eve.
---
Nothing about this indicates the client is authoritative; it just indicates the client has access to this information.
---
Now you’re just raising the (speculative) question of how many HiSec characters are alts. I already offered some numbers regarding alts.
---
How do I find good smaller corps to join?
---
We are discussing this in a thread that explicitly states:
---
\&gt; Yes you can mine under the largest umbrellas with the best defenses, but  your rewards will be so reduced it is worse than hi sec.
---
So what exactly is the incentive of conquering space and investing in infrastructure when you have to tear it down a month later or even faster cause you get reduced down to below high-sec?
---
If you had a different idea of the reward-balance then excuse the misunderstanding.
---
The sheer amount of ad-hominem attacks in your "argument" alone ought to be enough to show the class that you're the one who should stop posting...permanently.
---
I dont post. I shit in comments.   
---
Everyone needs a toilet and r/eve is a perfect one.
---
Seems like it was hated more than underrated :P
---
In his 2+ billion ISK T3 with which he'll engage nothing larger than a frigate.
---
Wat
---
Now just picture this but IRL = nine line divide 
---
Good thing we have the god emperor to save us!
---
So, if that truly was no problem for large entities (which I do not believe) then, what exactly is the point of all this?
---
I'm at work, waiting for tests that take about an hour.  Need something to do.
---
Watching the tumbleweeds roll by on the reddits for the games I currently play is not terribly entertaining.
---
Fucking this. So much this.
---
Anyone who pays attention to chinese culture knows that what he's saying is mostly true. Anything is ok as long as it doesn't hurt their own blood (family).
---
Not to piss in anyone's direction, it would be interesting to see how the skill point distribution is between these areas before and after BO.
---
Didn’t that burn tho?
---
Any particular systems this has happened in? For science reasons, obviously.
---
Ram drive you say?
---
No, unfortunately it doesn't. Tough to say what happened there.
---
Yeah that would’ve really interesting. I’d actually love to see some data on that.
---
I'm just mad he didn't let us whore in on the super he awoxed, we would have helped!
---
bigger than WTC
---
Might as well use it to find some boys. Fire this notification at everyone and ban anyone that warps out instantly
---
But wait, I have it on good authority that all bots use local. Are we saying now that this isn’t true?
---
already replaced
---
More spread out, alliances actually using their space, less safety, more initiative to actually own more space etc.
---
Ow.
---
muh freeze peach
---
You'd need a separate process to manage that and flush it to physical disk periodically.  Which increases complexity a lot compared to just writing to physical disk, for a situation that is (theoretically) pretty rare.
---
Not if you lick your fingers first
---
Once they've been used they're no longer identical.
---
Can you even repackage faction or t2 crystals? I expected not.
---
To add, Eve-U is neutral and actually focuses on teaching you the game. It's then easy to pick which group or playstyle to persue from there.
---
We don't really care about our social credit. You better start raising your shitposting game.
---
I would think Wally is more autistic
---
Its fine for me; but putting a lot of people out of the game is really shit... I’m on vacation in Mallorca anyways... was just sitting on the beach and thought... fuck eve
---
If you don't want to build supers or install certain ihub upgrades, sov isn't going to do anything important for you.  So why bother taking it?
---
Eve University. They seem to be the moat independent one. Horde is fun, but they have tons of blues now.
---
Wow, there's a lot of people playing stupid political games in this thread.
---
What do you want to do in eve, medium- to long-term?  The truth is, any of the major newbie groups (Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet, Brave Newbies, and TEST's Brand Newbros) will provide you a lot of help if you're willing to ask, with everything from venture mining to solo pvp all the way up to supers and how to acquire them.
---
The best advice I can give is to figure out what you want to do (for now, you can change this later) and join one.  If you like the culture and system of that group for what you want to do, great! Stick around.  If not, it's easy to switch, especially early on.  No one's going to freeze you out for briefly joining the opposition as a newbie. Every one of those groups will have starter assets available to you, too, so no need to worry about moving/losing all your stuff when you switch.
---
And above all, be outgoing and ask questions.  Eve as a game is far too large for anyone to present answers to all questions at all times, but if you ask, I 100% guarantee there's someone on comms that can answer.
---
I'd say none of them to be honest, at least until you know enough about the game to be able to decide what you like to do in the game for the long term.
---
These groups are efficient and do a good job of retaining players and keeping them playing the game, but they steer you down a very specific direction, the end-game of which is "sit in huge ships or huge fleets and press F1 when told to, attacking a citadel in lag that makes the game run at 1% of its normal speed". If that's your idea of fun (and i'm not being ironic here, lots of people like big fights despite the lag), sure, go ahead and join them.
---
If on the other hand you don't want to deal with drama, politics, mandatory attendance to strategic operations (which may often involve setting your alarm clock for 4am to go kill a citadel) and you want to have a more diverse understanding of the game and experience different playstyles, then make a few friends and strike out on your own, join a smaller group or just join EvE University for a while to get an idea of what is available/possible before you make a decision. You could still join one of the big groups to get a kickstart and learn a few things, just be ready to leave when you need to and be careful about being sucked into a playstyle that might not be enjoyable to you in the long run.
---
Another thing to keep in mind is that due to superior organization by players and quite a bit of negligence on behalf of CCP in predicting and reversing the trend, the nullsec playstyle got too dominant, too safe and too rewarding over the years, to the point that the nullsec game has been quite stagnant for a while. This resulted in CCP now trying to turn things around and inject some volatility back into the system, so the nullsec playstyle is being hit with a series of nerfs to certain game mechanics that affect their ability to remain safe and project power.
---
You don't really care about most of this as a new player in practical terms, because half the stuff that's getting nerfed is quite a long way in the future for you to get to, and the other half is stuff you have no prior experience of, so you lack a measure of comparison and a reason to complain (you don't know how easy things used to be, so you won't be upset they're taking that away from you). The main issue for you might be the vibe you get from other players there. I have no doubts that they will adapt, the ecosystem will find a new balance point eventually and they will keep going as usual. It just might be a bit annoying to join now, at the time where the changes are actually being rolled out, because there is a very vocal part of that playerbase currently complaining a lot and being very negative about the game as a whole.
---
What i would do if was in your place was either join Eve Uni, or try for a small-scale corporation that does a bit of everything so you can sample what is available. Lowsec corps that do a mix of PvP and industry are a good bet, and the same goes for corps that live in low class wormholes (you get both isk making opportunities and pvp) and nomadic nullsec corps who stage out of regions with NPC-owned stations (you get all the combat without the boring parts of shooting structures to conquer space, since it already belongs to an NPC faction and can't be taken from them).
---
The smaller amount of people makes for a more close-knit community because they depend on each other more than they depend on a faceless mega-infrastructure that provides them with free stuff. Furthermore, groups like these teach you to be self-sufficient in order to survive. This means you'll be growing up in a harsher environment but still under the guidance of people who have it figured out to an extent, so you will gain a lot more skills in the long run.
---
The average combat pilot in a smaller group is also much more skilled than the average pilot in a mega-fleet, because they have to be able to punch above their weight if they're going to snag a kill or two in their group of 10-20 dudes before 200 angry guys come to kill them in the biggest ships in the game.
---
Seriously, if you get the chance to join a corp like that, take it, you'll learn so much (grid control, positioning, fitting a ship properly by yourself, engaging outnumbered, estimating which fights to take, recognizing bait, taking the bait on purpose and living to tell the tale, doing recon and surveillance on high value targets, setting up traps and ambushes, and so on) and have so much fun. The only problem might be scrounging the isk to replace ships, but if they have a bit of an industrial side as well or a place to make money in, you should be fine.
---
You can also stay in the starting corp for a while longer and find a few guys to fly around with as a group, try out different things, then you can all migrate into another corp together, or start your own little adventure.
---
I'm going to end this with a few useful links.

Don't post a personal ad there, you'll get a bunch of the biggest groups trying to recruit you immediately to pad numbers. Instead, just lurk for a while and see what kind of corporation ads get posted. After a while you will be able to discern who recruits anyone with a pulse to get more warm, faceless bodies in their group vs who is actually looking for a few good people to get to know and play with. Once you find a corp with a description/ad you like in a timezone that works for you, contact them in-game and see if you're a good fit for each other.

RE: RE: RE: FWD: RE: HILARIOUS MEME
---
Keep up the good work guys!
---
The decline started in January, save for one small bump.
---
You can make boatloads of isk if you go to null but it's maybe not the best way to learn the game. Eve Uni might be great... I certainly got a lot out of it.
---
Oh. As someone who is currently playing during the blackout, I’ve had more fun times and scarier fights since I can remember. Keep topped up with that sunscreen and enjoy your holiday ✌️
---
Nah, working as intended. The client is just detecting small quantum fluctuations in nearby space time caused by the cloaked ship. 
---
Done.
---
Well at least now you mentioned a source for your earlier numbers. Your 85% number comes from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3j7nso/at_least_we_know_how_many_alts_there_are/cun2q2o/) by CCP Quant, that is 4 years old and based on a lot of guesswork by CCP. 
---
What I am getting at here is that only CCP has the tools to analyze the character data, activity, skill points etc, to come to a conclusion about where people in EVE actually 'live' and what percentage are alts. If they even have done a thorough analysis (since Quant left), you wouldn't know the details, because CCP doesn't publish these numbers.
---
Oh good point. They could probably just not surface the log for the noise. I mean sure you could still break open the binary and maybe still find it, but if you are doing that you are already finding all kinds of spicy stuff most likely.
---
KarmaFleet is Recruiting

Yup. When i am exploring and hacking, i have a finger spamming dscan and one hovering over the S key to warp to my perch which i have right above my hacking window. Takes practice to get your method worked out. Also, make the enemies and neutrals have blinking background colors to pull your attention

Just when I was a shitty newbie belt ratting at least I had local; even then I was like it’s fine a nuets here; just shooting NPCs in my drake.... oh another ship and... what’s that flare thing... oh shit where did 20 people just teleport from and I’m dead ... just mega shit for newbies now; good luck on retention now... assholes

Have hacking skills at V, a covops hull, T2 analyzers, and the T2 virus strength rig. Then you can pretty much be "fuck Rule of 6, I'm just gonna click this node" and still win almost all of them.
---
I guess it could be. A lot of us are adapting, ratting aligned, using myrn MJDs and scouts on gates. 
---
I feel in a way it’s great for newbies as it lets them experience how brutal eve can be (it really isn’t for everyone).

40mil SP character coming back after a good long while. Going to spend a month or two just solo pvping while training up for what I have decided will be my next Eve adventure, solo wormholing. 
---
My question is, what are the kind of minimum requirements for wormhole living? I have pretty much only trained armor combat skills for pirate living. What skills should I train up to be successful? Or maybe the better question is, who has links to good guides or WH corporations that can aid a solo player and his questions
---
The general rule is 1 input equals 1 output. I’ve used AHK aswell for trading. Iater on filled a ticket to ask if it was actually allowed. Got a response saying what I just said. So I had to quit it. They might not care too much though.

&gt;But i think your members said some  politically sensitive topics at local is not honorable

Oh boy -- well, politically sensitive topics are discussed as easily and commonly as the weather outside of authoritarian regimes, so you should be ready for more of that.

People take the path of least resistance most of the time. First it's the more casual players who maybe would have formed a micro gang to fight the roamer(s) in their space. Now when someone roams said space there are less fights to be had, so they also queue for matchmaking instead of forming a few buddies to go roam. Now there are even less targets, now even the BSB autists are queueing for solo matchmaking because there is nothing to fight aside from afk myrms and boson titans. Now no one is roaming at all.
---
Matchmaking arenas kill open world pvp in MMO's, no exceptions. The nature of open world pvp in Eve the only thing this game offers imo. Kill that and i will be queueing in one of the 100's of far more mechanically interesting "fair and competitve" games out there.

Rip all fights started by cyno inties
---
The goon slap down horde pulled in M-MD was started cause goons cynoed in dreads from a cyno ares, then horde responded by cynoing in from their cyno ares.
---
Then we had a dread brawl. In 2019! A dread brawl! I haven’t seen that in forever. No other caps (maybe horde had some carriers idk) but it was sweet.
---
So, 50 people regularly camp in a worm hole for days on end to catch a ratter?
---
Why flush, keep it while eve is running, drop soon after - simply stating the obvious.
---
That's AFK mining, Mr. Contrarian. When you focus your attention on another activity. If you really loved mining you'd be paying 100% attention the entire time, as the players who love PvP do.
---
Easy there Satan.
---
How would you adjust the mini-game idea for folks mining in contested territory/wormholes/low-sec/etc. where they're mashing D-Scan, watching for rats,  and the like?
---

---
I will state that I have cut back again, after resubbing a few accounts and buying plex. At this point I am going to keep one account open and see if the game doesn't have major player drops in the next two years. 
---
The reason for the wait is that the next 2-3 years is when all the mmo's that are a open sandbox is going to be in beta or out of beta/released. I am skeptical many people are going to stick with Eve and the developers/community won't be be able to fix the issues by then.
---
is there a recording of it?
---
Unless you're hunting other explorers, you don't actually NEED an Astero. A cloaky Buzzard also works, and has better explo stats when you get the covops skills to 4.
---
I meant hide in the sense of obscuring the data sent to the client so an automatic traffic monitoring software can't easily detect which kind of information is sent to the client. But the first thing that comes to my mind would be constantly sending packages of the same size which get filled up with dummydata to the maximum size it can have so an information about a gatejump can't be separated from anything else happening by monitoring the amount or size of packages transmitted but as i said im guessing that would strain the network traffic.  
---
That said i'm a total ape when it comes to network stuff so i'm sure someone could easily think of a better solution.

whoah there bucko, we have a monopoly on the blue donut and we are not beyond litigation to maintain our status

Nice, just joined and sucking on the teet already. When can we expect him to tripple box rorquals and complain about how his carrier can´t track frigates? Before or after he quits out of boredom?
---
The real question is: why are the TCU and IHUB even different structures?
---
To limit how much RAM is required to store the logs.  Also, you want these logs to persist so that you can use them for debugging, especially when you're trying to debug some customer's crashes.  Dropping them "soon after" is a very bad idea.
---
I hit a ton of ghost sites this weekend while in sansha null. Found an implant blueprint worth 575m as well as some limited sleeper cache with polarized BPCs. Made it out with 550m worth of loot, mostly intact armor plates for a total of around 1b when I drug it all to Jita.

These are some typical Astero fits.  They're fit with a little bit of combat power, so if you catch a covert ops or T1 explo frig, you can pop them.  The sisters probes are generally worth the investment, the sisters launcher is optional.  It'll help you scan faster but is a bit pricier.
---
Other than that, make sure you have probes on your d-scan filter, and if you see any, immediately get out of the site and get cloaked until you can get a line on what's scanning.  T1s or covops you can pop, asteros are a gamble, anything else should be avoided at all costs.  Just move on, it's better to have to look for another site for a while than risk your whole haul.
---
As a general tip, anytime you're looking for fits, search zkill.  Every ship has an identifier that you can attach to the URL that filters for that ship.  For instance, this: https://zkillboard.com/ship/33468/ is every kill involving an Astero.  You can find the identifier by using the search bar.  You can also filter losses only, for a specific alliance, system, or region, etc.  Some newbie-friendly ships can be a bit of a mess on there (Astero is one, I had to look for a good 5 minutes to find a decent fit to link you) but if you can find a fit from a player/alliance with a respectable killboard, chances are good it's at least a decent fit.

No, man, it's the GAME that's wrong.
---
The game literally runs an animation and a sound.  You just need to watch for the access to that animation and/or sound when the client starts playing it.
---
&gt;But the first thing that comes to my mind would be constantly sending packages of the same size which get filled up with dummydata to the maximum size it can have so an information about a gatejump can't be separated from anything else happening by monitoring the amount or size of packages transmitted
---
This, btw, is a very bad idea.  You don't want to take up a bunch of the player's bandwidth with junk.
---
The client must take an action based on what's happening in-game.  So the information must be sent to the client in a way the client can understand.  They have root access to the machine running the client.  Which means they see everything the client does, and everything sent to or received from the client.  And they can literally read the memory of the client.
---
It is not possible to hide this without removing gate fires completely.

We are doing our best to keep ADM low. Bots now have resorted to not running during EUTZ after losing a lot of hardware. Most Fade GWU-Safestructures are reinforced by now, and we try to organize some Kill-Fleet on their shitty final CN-TZ timers
---
&gt;Shunning krabs from the elite pvp crowd, or somehow making a pipedream of a universe of smallgang pirate wormholer (insert pvp buzzword here) a reality would not be fun as it would be harder to get kills
---
I don't know about you, but... uhh... I was actually killing people in null before the blackout.
---
Sounds cool. I can't attack that, but then I can't attack a carrier either.
---
Yup, we're setting up timers / burning anything that falls USTZ.
---
Shit man I think we did. How's it going these days?

With the death of Wormbro (F) there is not one corp in WH space I would recommend to a total newbro. A total newbro is better off in a FW corp, eve uni or one of the blob newbro corps (hopefully leaving after a couple of months).
---
WHbtw.
---
You are on crack. I have been playing this game a long time, and how 'safe' null sec was has always been dependent on whichever alliance I was in. Largely speaking, with the exception of 'getting stuff in and getting stuff out' null sec has been safer than low sec since I started playing in 2005-2006, and safer in a lot of ways than high sec for just the same amount of time, again... depending on the effort the alliance you were in put into defending their space.
---
So.. the solution is to create a bot that just jumps back and forth between common botting gates all day so the botters never actually make any isk? Sounds like fun
---
Thanks! I'll have myself a looksie. Forgot about that sub
---
Pods are helpless if you're in an interdiction bubble. Otherwise, pods have a 0.17s align time and the sig radius of a light drone, and should be able to insta-warp escape any bad situation.
---
Yes, as a low sec pirate for *many many years* I can say with confidence that the vast majority of l33t pvpers *will not* inject a mining alt, start mining belts, then inject an industrial alt, and start building ships.
---
Yeah as i already said i agree it was a bad idea, just one possible thing. Regarding the rest i admittedly have no idea of the inner workings of the client so i had no idea how.... well, deep their access really is. My train of thought was aimed towards simple network monitoring in that particular instance because of another comment in here mentioning it was already detectable through that, which is a bit too easy imo.
---
So nothing they TZ tank au tz despite being a us tz group lmao.

Welcome to Ece. I'm not a newb, but my corp is very newb friendly. Based in Amarr space. PM me if interested.

You wanna know what's not honorable? Breaking agreements like you did.
---
I find all mine in C1-C3 wormholes. Found five in one system about three hours ago. More likely to have not been found and run.
---
Don't warp to the ones named "Unsecured \[whatever\]" though, those are combat sites.
---
Amazing how alpha managed to ping without using an @ symbol. He must have hacked all our discord clients to have that ping us.
---
Id keep it the same as the hacking minigame, it basically is an extra window and you have to keep track of your surroundings while mining.
---
Imagine a game so meta that even the smallest amount of back end data gets seen as an advantage.
---
Mr Drone Wang was too busy buying a new car from his RMT money, later pinging his members he was sorry he couldn't be there but that he was sure there would be plenty of super fights in the future (lol cyno changes) and letting his members know he would write a manual on how to use titans (no joke)
---
On the previous timer he told his members our titans were formed and ready to jump in, after scouting them previously two gate jumps and another mid away, he also blamed his lack of balls on that we batphoned INIT in a stuka fleet, that stuka fleet was streaming on twitch killing test capitals on the other side of the universe. 
---
Before that he just didn't show up to a timer, saying his bus lost one wheel on the way home.
---
Thanks for atleast giving us one titan brawl, GOTG can go back to being shit again and RR to being a renter alliance.
---
There is like one guy who shows up 4 times on that report, another guy that shows up twice. And I don't think the guy who died in a horder was really part of the fight. Still not 14, but they were still pretty heavily outnumbered.
---
This hurt
---
what you mean kiki fleet?
---
BR shows mostly bombers.
---
Any bets that this was something new they added because removing local broke some goofy hack they were using? Timing seems right.
---
Funny that you, in your wormholes, with your ability to roll holes, and krab all day in absolute safety such that your small numbers are generating around 14% of the total 'wealth' generated in the game, are complaining about null sec being so safe. 
---
Don't think that this irony is missed on everyone. Wormholes are super scary on paper, but with just a little bit of knowledge, currently 10x safer than null.
---
Honestly, I would say neither. Try and find a small but active new player corp and join that (sorry I don't have any recommendation).
---
Problem with PH and BN is they don't really do much teaching. BN used to have like dojo classes (might still have them I don't know), but I think a more one on one or small group teaching you is better.
---
I guess you're right, so far 3 total things that have changed in this game that's over a decade old
---
You can however BM and warp to them, so if the trick still works to put a probe on them you can pretty consistently decloak them with a little luck and/or a few people warping to the spot.
---
U-QMOA may or may not have an above average concentration of easy things to kill
---
Haha. I tend to fall back to my formative RPGs when in MMO lulls. Sierra classic adventure/RPG games, Baldur's Gate. &lt;3 90s RPGs.
---
Multiple account instances, then, I take it? All of them funneling their ISK to one account?
---
That... was an extremely excessive amount of words for no reason other than trying to make an inexperienced player feel bad about being inexperienced.
---
I've been running around hacking relics for over a year at this point and I still have no idea what the spawn rates of them are (beyond "the good ones spawn in C1-C3", wormholer^(btw)), so that point's irrelevant as is its associated insult.
---
&gt; The less people explore in the region, the higher the chance the site that spawns is actually found by you. Have you tried e.g. coloring your map by people in space and then choosing the region of NS that you wanna explore in by selecting the least travelled region? 
---
Okay now this is good, this is actual good advice on finding relics. Searching for the least-explored regions, to go explore them. (Although given that "coloring your map by people in space" isn't an obvious button to look for, it might also be good to bring up how to do that. Once again, I wasn't aware that was even a function of the in-game map, and would have assumed that an explanation of Dotlan would also be in order.)
---
Translation: I like it, I was stunned by the reddit. 歪果仁 also likes the rhythm of the teacher, it seems that "many must be stupid" this truth applies globally.
---
TAPIs discord isn't much better. Just a bit more "I was afk and didn't read ping what is going on"
---
Helping newbies is nice. Free ships, free skillbooks are all super useful and both PH and BN do that I think. And having a good market to shop at in null is great as well, but I think what both of those alliances lack is the teaching element. BN used to give dojo classes in the past, don't think they do that anymore (please correct me if I'm wrong). I would have recommended them if they still did those.
---
Otherwise, go find a small newbie friendly corp that's actually going to teach you about EVE rather then just give you free stuff.
---
&gt;Then they came for the ECM, and you did not speak out
---
Hahahahahahaha... don't understand pvp. That just shows you're either ignorant, or have an ideological stance that won't allow you to stop sniffing your own farts.

Hello fellow new_player#52476

Generic response to a generic question here.

Enjoy your stay...

I wish someone with better morals would go ahead and take over Dek already. Kinda like how tribute and Vale are now with a bunch of small alliances. Would make sense to just drop the hammer already.
---
You don't need 50 people to kill Wormhole ratters. That is sort of my hole point here. You are dealing with at largest capital level tank not super cap tank, and often you are hunting subcap tank of things like spider nestors if you are high class or active rattles if you are low. 
---
You can do that with a few people, and I have had 8+ man hole camps that run for months.
---
bring back Sinpwn
---
I disagree, big groups are able to provide you everything you need whenever you need for any objective you need, which could be skill books, market, bpcs, anything.
---
This F1 monkey narrative is stupid, first of all it's not like this, second you'll be part of a team, you will play together as a team, and not like a useless lonewolf or a small gang that in the end is able to only gatecamp or gank some retard or bot in myrmidon...
---
Huge fights could be boring but they are not mandatory and think about it, they are the only things people remember in this game.
---
Nobody cares about fw, or small gang fights, having part in the B-R fight, the siege of M-O, the destruction of Rage... This is history man, these are the events for which Eve will be remembered even after its death.
---
And everyone could be part of it, even a newbie.
---
Entering a big alliance does not mean to being restricted to huge fights.
---
There are many great corps in those alliances that organize great fleets, they organize courses for anything, they have junior FC programs, logi programs and so on.
---
Many of those corps do a lot of things together, like mining ops, ratting in groups (specially now with this damn blackout), response fleets, specialized groups for blackops and many other things.
---
They simply can offer you the most wider spectrum of activities and help, think about it.
---
Replied to the wrong comment? (FWIW, I was killing people in null before the blackout too. I do find the blackout makes for a more fun hunting experience for me though.)
---
There's a difference between shitting on someone and making an observation. If I make an observation and you determine that the observation is something negative, it doesn't mean I am shitting on them.
---
Wasn't it one of Pando's Stuka fleets?
---
None -- join a little one! Then you'll actually make friends with a know-able amount of people you enjoy being with, instead of being 1 in 1000.

Indeed, I find it serendipitous that a whale calls himself a whaler.

&gt;r fewer bots since the first few days of the blackout.
---
You have, not because they left, but because they moved. There are many many ways to bot in eve and get your RMT on if that's your livelihood. There are courier mission bots, there are level 4 mission bots, there are level 5 mission bots, there are faction warfare bots, there are (such that they still exist) static complex bots, etc., 
---
I get it. You want to be right, and it would help if these changes really were 'just getting rid of bots;' however, you fail to understand that 90% of those bots are connected to RMTers who make a living with those bots, and they are not going to just throw their hands up and go 'whelp, my bot army in null sec no long works. Guess its time to find a new job!" ***Especially*** when there are ***so gods damn many ways to bot in eve.***
---
It's not about building ships, I've flown with some amazing PVPers that built ships to fund their explosions. It's about a risk averse majority of the playerbase that propagates a mentality that's unhealthy for the game.
---
Nah my point was more that the people I see in space are mostly real players now, which has been great. Nice effort though 🤣
---
I'll take your word for it, considering I've never been a part of either, and only stopped being a doe-eyed bean after they lost their reputation of being elite.
---
I've never mined much myself, once I realized how low the payout is. So I'm no expert. But my understanding is that it starts to be reasonable when you have 3 exhumers and an Orca and a pilot who can deliver boosts. All 4 characters have to be Omega to pilot those ships.
---
What I hear these days is that real miners multibox Rorquals.

Everyone has an opinion, your welcome to yours. Without a downvote.

You're attempting to compare what could theoretically be done with what was actually done.  I'm talking about what was actually done.

From trying to place my own POS, I'd estimate about 70-80% of the game's moons had a POS.  That's way, way, way, way more spam than citadels, and way more than citadels could reach anytime soon.

There's a difference between saying "everyone in a particular group does \[x\]" and saying something is prevalent in a group. 
---
It's funny how we'll cite statistics to back up our claims about almost everything else, yet when it comes to talking about people it's considered offensive. If 99% of \[insert demographic\] does \[insert behavior\] then we are not allowed to assume it's probable that any one person will fall in to that 99% category.
---
I think of it this way:
---
For better or worse, CCP expended much capital over the last decade trying to pivot to other products. That was capital that could have either enhanced experiences in EVE with new features or quality of life fixes. 
---
Unfortunately for them, most if not all of those pivot products failed to find a lucrative market. 
---
CCP has recently been re-investing their capital into EVE as they realize their core product is aging and losing revenue (linked roughly to the declining player count metric in the OP). 
---
The blackout is a result of a CCP decision point: either experiment with conflict drivers in a hope of increasing the value of gameplay (and revenue), or accept that EVE is EOL and minimize investment in the product. 
---
The risk of pissing off PVE'ers was most likely weighed and found to be one that CCP was willing to sustain if it drove increasing activity (and subscriptions) for other play styles.
---
I personally have resubbed after 4-5 years of inactivity and found the game to be more enjoyable (once I adapted my play-style from large fleet fights and sov to small gangs and wormholes). I can see why others are doing the opposite though.
---
Ultimately, EVE is a game about conflict. If CCP can increase the frequency of player interactions and conflict, then the game's population will increase and they'll have more capital to invest in continuing to sustain this product. If their experiments in this area fail, then the game will suffer. Blackout is one experiment, the upcoming cyno changes will be another. Asset safety, benefits of sov, tethering, and increased isk sinks are all things I would expect to see CCP experiment on in the mid term to drive large player populations into more frequent conflict.

Why was it removed?

There's several different philosophies for Astero fits.
---
* 4x Warp Core Stab. If you're really afraid of getting scrammed, this makes you immune to anything less than a scram and a faction scram, so even other Asteros with 2xT2Scram can't get you. However, this comes at the cost of wrecking your lock time and align time, which slows your ability to run sites and contributed to you not being able to warp out in time. (Also, warp core stabs won't save you from a Sabre bubble.)
---
* 4x Inertial Stab. Insta-warp. This one's probably the best if you're paying attention to your DScan and surroundings, but also really really don't wanna get caught.
---
* The Hunter. This is the fun one, and the one where I'm actually going to drop a full fit. Because this is the one where, when an enemy astero jumps you, you don't run, you fight back. Or on the flip side, if you see a Heron or a ~~Piano~~ Imicus trying to steal your site, you show up and kill *him*. There's a bunch of different variants and ideas for fits, but here's one possibility
---
&amp;#8203;
---
    [Astero, Simulated Astero Fitting]

    Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane II

Also, general principle: stick with the MWD on an Astero most of the time. You can do an AB for certain hunting fits, but if you're going to be doing mostly scanning do the MWD. Much faster for hopping cans.
---
No, mate. You are trying to give me a lot of reasons about things that don't have to do with the question.  We are talking in two different directions and whether it is intentional or not.  As it stands and the nerf to cyno coming, it becomes a question of whether or not someone wants to be out in space randomly waiting for someone to decloak and have a fleet wipe them out. That's not risk aversion. That's just not fun. It's not a case of adapt or die. It's not a case of risk vs. reward. Those are not the statement points. There are merits to all of those discussion points and I'm not arguing it. I'm saying that the notion of sitting down for an hour at the computer and hoping you win the RNG of no one being in system/cloaked/next to you/lighting a cyno and 200 nerds bombing you/haha you can't cyno in reinforcements... that's not really a fun proposition. The merits of it, the needs for change or balance are the side topic. The main point is that if something isn't fun, people simply won't do it.
---
Wonder if this is to do with new visual effects?
---
When was the last time these things (jumping, cloak, etc) were on a patch?
---
Good call. Might be a client ovrrsight
---
I guess they thought they could roll in like it was Tienanmen Square.
---
Well too bad. Your tank/super umbrella can't get in there.
---
You cannot and I would be OK with a very lossy merge and fix. For CCP the biggest benefit would be to allow people to remove millions of un packaged uniquely damaged laser crystals from their DB. That can't be bad for performance. Maybe you'd need crystals summing up to 150% of "full" to repackage and that'd be A-OK. I have hundreds of 0-5% damaged crystals I looted from the corpses of my opponents (with "Loot All" because I needed to GTFO.)

If you've got core probes, you can get out pretty easily. Class 1-3 wormholes always have a k-space connection, and those are the ones with pirate relic+data sites anyway. Bookmark wormholes on the other side as you jump through, and you'll have a chain leading all the way back. In the event something has collapsed on your return, just scan a new exit.
---
Excellent question!  No, I do not believe the earth is 4000 years old.  I am not questioning the validity of the data at all - I am questioning the intentions of the person who posted it, due to their affiliation with a group who has publicly stated their intentions to get people to quit EVE.
---
Thanks for taking the time to respond!
---
Armor doctrines are most common in wormholes, so that works. Train scanning too. Cloaking IV is essential.
---
Goonswarm does fleet training twice a week, supercap training fleets when sisi is open, and has weekly classes on industry/salvage/PI/making money in general.
---
No i’m taking the position of not being a froth mouthing ragelord. 
---
Good or bad is irrelevant in what i’m saying and you know that
---
J-space is my favourite part of EVE.
---
The money incentive is definitely there to go deeper, if ccp fixes this. But it might kill off basic bots by removing the log update
---
Save your current laptop for the alpha alt!
---
Wicked creek panda sanctuary
---
It does, however, simplify programming a bot to look for this.
---
If you get a string output in a log that says "hey, the gate fired" you don't have to teach the bot to watch the overview for someone to appear for a second.
---
The thumping?
---
I’ll help sing backup if thats what it takes
---
Post of the year contender right here
---
Perhaps this is what the log is doing:registering the sound fx?
---
Yes. You can right-click on the Orbit button in the selected object information panel and select Set Default Orbit. That'll bring up an entry box to type in a value.
---
Although, bigger than that: Don't orbit the cans. Use Keep At Range so you get to the can and stop moving. If you're Orbiting the can, you have some amount of velocity in an arbitrary direction, which means that when you want to try to panic warp off your alignment is all to hell and you'll need to waste a bunch of time slowing down and turning before you can escape.
---
And (to reiterate), the reason we say to Keep At Range at 2250m is specifically that if you're beyond 2000m from the can, if someone comes to ambush you, you can panic hit your cloaking device and buy yourself a few more seconds to try to escape.
---
Okay thanks a lot for this will try it out. I've never used drones before nor a warp scrambler/capacitor booster/armor repairer/damage drone amplifier. How do these work?
---
CCP loves money. If skins for stinky capitals make good money, they hold those nose and make them.
---
Captial ships are inexpensive compared to the year 2015.
---
yes they do; they they just want your money.
---
who said it was a ping?
---
Market trader here.  Various packaged tools come and go, but most only last a year or two and then the developer moves on to other things.  As a result, I generally use only the stuff I've created myself (99% spreadsheets).
---
Also, read the Monthly Economic Reports religiously - there's gold in them thar hills, son.
---
So if I have 2 accounts, when I switch to manage one account, now I’m “AFK mining” on the first account?
---
What if the two accounts are side-by-side windows? Now I’m not AFK mining in either one, right? Because I’m sitting there staring at the windows, even if there’s nothing to do with either client for 5 minutes?
---
But add a Netflix window and now it is “AFK mining”?
---
What happens if I have one client mining, but I’m managing PI or browsing the market on that client? Is that “AFK mining”?
---
Large groups don't require their members to alarm clock for a citadel because they have enough in all time zones to cover it.  I mean, you can type all day long and still not know what you are talking about.
---
Good to see that both #ships destroyed and ISK destroyed in WH is reaching HS levels. I wonder if the previous estimate of \~5% of EVE population living in WH is still accurate ?
---
This may or may not be a defect depending on CCP's latest designs and intents. But please do tell, what impact does this "bug" have on end users?
---
Goonswarm has an entire mentorship program.  Your little small corp can barely fully SRP stratop losses, much less ALL losses. Have a question in GSF?  We have multiple ways to ask questions, whether ingame or out of game.  
---
Or, you can join your group and do nothing more than gatecamp because you can't get enough people online to do anything else.
---
I’m glad to see you concede that you have no ground to make any claims about alts and where people live.
---
Couldn't have said it better
---
&gt;ll sec was intended to be a pvp arena? Have fun hunting the 3 
---
Yeah, he's right... university classes starting are totally why this game, whose average player was in there late twenties or early thirties *6 years ago,*  has seen a significant drop in logins starting in *July* and also why those logins were down by more than 5k last Sunday. 
---
I mean just look at me. I am 42 and ~~went to grad school for 7 years, and still finished college 8 years ago~~ definitely still in college!
---
Gooniversity is THE premiere teaching group in Eve Online, filled with actual experts, not just some guys who read from a script like other groups (E-Uni).
---
Can confirm. Is good choice. But unless your favorite thing about the game is keeping your Orcas on a daily 0.5 Athanor schedule, you're going to want to move to somewhere else at some point. I'm currently scoping out other entities to see where I want to go, though I still recommend joining for at least a couple of months.
---
&gt;Every init member is required to have a so called "ghost alpha", which is in fact an alpha account with a toon dedicated to flying merlin / corm / ferox, for home defense and to avoid unnecessary jump clones.   
---
So you basically copied NC.'s Seal Team Six?
---
It´s not empty, it´s fucking big and has a lot of content. But dude, it´s ok, we all have different taste and opinions. I love both, I am just saying that Elite is more like a simulator in many ways and the graphics are awesome.
---
You dont have to be poor due to not krabbing, you buy PLEX and sell them, so you guys can sub your accounts with your online grind, while I can earn this money IRL and concentrate on my RL rather than having to grind one of the most awful PvE-Metas of all MMO.
---
E-uni actually has some people that know their stuff, at least they did 7 years ago.
---
I just needs the functions that we get from neocom. How the heck did they release this without all the existing ability of a old third party app
---
&gt;are pants-shittingly furious that they are no longer
---
Nice straw man. I dare you, I double dog dare you, to show me a post where someone whines about looking at their client. News flash buddy, prior to the blackout people had to actually look at their client to know whether or not a hostile jumped into local or not. 
---
So your argument isn't just a strawman, its also dumb.
---
If the outcome of the E-Uni these days is highsec Orca miners, it has fallen very very low.
---
I mean, this is a small group that directly benefited off of blackout because of this corps gameplay style. Hmmmmmmmmmmm
---
just find a citadel where clone swapping is cheap/free
---
It's frt
---
I'm glad you concede that we both have the same ground on that. This whole shitshow of comments started because you claimed 'most players' wouldn't care about nullsec.
---
99% of botters are RMTers. So your argument is, linked to the argument that botters just don't login anymore despite having dozens of ways to just move their botting operation to missions, the market, faction warfare, etc., is:
---
1. People who made a living botting were banned; AND 
---
2. Instead of just making and injecting a new account, they:
---
   1. Decided to get a new job?
---
big and beautyful is true - but as you say it is more a simulator and thus not compareable to EVE. If you want to see something that has the potential to replace EVE, it would be something like this https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRPE8HHvv1EYu8YwqNgOD8w
---
I think a response needs to be a bit more significant than, “...something we’re currently looking at”. We need a more complete reply as to what happened, why it happened, who or what is responsible, and what is done to remedy the problem.
---
You're a great example of a carebear blind to context who needs everything spelled out in legalese. Always looking for a loophole to legitimize your antisocial bot-like behaviors. The term "AFK mining" functions as a litmus test to detect your kind—because everybody else *gets it* intuitively. The lesson is, if what you're doing doesn't demand your full attention, then you're not really playing the game.
---
9 EUR for party only ticket.
---
I might do that. A bunch of TURN LEFT / Camel / Goryn dudes have a Berlin meetup as well, without going to the G-fleet one.
---
+5 implants really aren’t worth the price. You can get +4 implants for a tenth of the price and then you don’t stress about dying and you don’t have to worry about swapping clones.
---
That would be perfect but whats the best way to locate a citadel like that?
---
Hey newbie, play this game. It costs $12 per month for the sub, and then you have to pay an additional $20 to get some in game money to buy ships so you can fly... hey where are you going?
---
Hilmar doesn't "get it". He plays, sure, but he doesn't understand any part of the game outside the experience of a wormholer with a nullsec static. He doesn't for a second understand or appreciate the work that goes into having a nullsec empire; he just sees the fat, dumb targets and thinks he's entitled to kills.
---
Why else do you think the blackout exists and the cyno changes are coming? They're both attempts to pander to the likes of Olmeca Gold at the expense of everyone else.
---
Floating around a relic site in Null in a paper-thin ship I'd probably still stress about it, tbh.  But thanks for that tip I'll definitely look at +4's
---
This.
---
Delve is pretty much the *only* place where there was an increase in bounty payouts. Like we keep telling everyone, at the end of the day most of these changes are affecting other people in null--not that we haven't seen fewer people in Delve, or in Alliance, over the past couple months. 
---
Its just that, we have our shit together, we are highly organized, and we can respond a lot better to these changes than *many many* other groups of players who lived in null.
---
That is a serious challenge. One of the main problems is finding a corp with enough people to have fun with in your own timezone. So, I agree that small tight nit groups are more fun with I do kinda think a larger group tends to be better for people early on, because when you're new, you don't really know what youre gonna enjoy and places with tons of people around is where you'll get to find out.
---
&gt;e you using? Just throwing words like hypothesis and P and significannce around doesn't mean anything.
---
Are you saying those words and phrases don't have referents or meaning. You are wrong, in absolutely every language model that exists.
---
No! I never said I wanted to replace EVE or eve compare Elite with EVE. Just that Elite is fucking beautiful. 
---
Thanks for that link, didn´t know it!
---
structure browser, sort for only clone bays on cities, show info, services has the clone bay price
---
Tranquility trading tower keeptstar in perimeter has a competitively priced clone service. Consider getting some prospector skill ware, 3% is inexpensive and can make the difference whilst scanning.
---
So you posted about it
---
thank you my dude! hope ccp picks it up
---
Taiwan is the legitimate Chinese government.
---
who said they're op?
---
&gt;I'm saying that the notion of sitting down for an hour at the computer and hoping you win the RNG of no one being in system/cloaked/next to you/lighting a cyno and 200 nerds bombing you/haha you can't cyno in reinforcements... that's not really a fun proposition. The merits of it, the needs for change or balance are the side topic. The main point is that if something isn't fun, people simply won't do it.
---
As to the counter point of playing the RNG game of hoping someone is braindead enough to notice all of the free intel given by the game and you are able to get on grid ONTOP of the RNG of hoping they don't have a cyno ready to light anyway preventing their carelessness from mattering.
---
AND even ignoring the question of merit of these changes which can be reasonably argued in both directions this whole chain section is about people being able to drop people without warning in JSpace which is and has always been possible.
---
TBF that seems more likely to be someone AFKing than botting.  Who would run a bot that fails at the most basic point of botting?
---
No we dont.
---
Okay that's a lot of individual parts you've never used before, have you been doing basically nothing but exploration?
---
Okay, going down the line
---
* Drones: When you have Drones placed inside a ship's Drone Bay (they must be in the Drone Bay or they can't be launched), you get an extra menu window that lets you control them. The bars in the window show the drones' Shields/Armor/Structure HP. Select some drones from that window and either right-click-&gt;Launch, or just drag them out into space, and they launch. Once in space, they'll orbit your ship until you target an enemy and tell the drones to Attack (I think this is the F key by default?), at which point they will fly to that target, orbit it, and shoot it. Right-click the group of drones in the window and hit Return To Drone Bay to bring them home (or there's a button, Shift+R I think? Either that or Ctrl+R?) There's a bunch more things with drones but that's the basics of working with them.
---
* Warp Scrambler: Activate on an enemy ship. Disables their Warp Drive, Microwarp Drive, and Micro Jump Drive. If a ship has enough Warp Core Stabs, they can still escape. (2x Stab will beat one T1/T2 Scram, 3x Stab will beat a Navy Scram.) Use this to hold the enemy on the field and force them to fight you.
---
* Capacitor Booster: Activate to gain a large chunk of Capacitor instantly. Consumes Cap Booster charges to operate. The number on the charge is how much capacitor you get. Use this when you're low on capacitor and need to keep the armor repairers going
---
* Armor Repairer: Activate to, at the *end* of its cycle, restore some armor HP. Consumes a good bit of capacitor, so don't just leave it on.
---
* **Ancillary** Armor Repairer: Same as a regular armor repairer, but must be loaded with Nanite Repair Paste to be effective. Very very long reload time when it runs out of paste so make sure you right-click and Set Auto-Reload Off. Much more powerful than a regular armor repairer, as long as it has paste, but much weaker without paste. Only use it in single cycles when the first armor repairer isn't enough, and *always* Overload it before you use it.
---
* Drone Damage Amplifier: Increases the damage your combat drones deal per shot. Not really a lot else to it.
---
I don't think it was someone who was AFK because after we killed a few of them a couple warped back to the belt in pods
---
Well I started 2007 with 2 accounts, subbed from the start, even when 90d of gametime in ISK did cost 50% of 30 days now. That ISK is devaluated the way it is, is 100 % in responsibility of the afk-multibox-pve meta. In 2008/09 1 good DED-Drop was enough to sub 2 accounts, compare it with today ...
---
vOv
---
Maybe you found the last of a local bots that didn't update for blackout.
---
Yeah the art department doesn’t hate them, that’s about it....
---
YOU ARE ALWAYS RIGHT WHEN YOU USE CAPSLOCK
---
I'd be fine if they moved cynos to structures only with a significant warm up timer to jump. The idea of fleets of subcaps or capitals jumping makes beach heads and gate blockades mean little and a lot of the terrain of space and defense stances or offensive strategies goes by the wayside.
---
This IS defect since I recently saw my own alt on my main's overview while he's been covert cloaked at distance of 27au. If this is not a defect then I don't know what is.
---
It seems weird, so I should re-check - do you really asking me why info in target's game client log about covert hunter landing on grid is bad? Like, really?
---
Damn, thanks a lot. Would you mind mailing me the fit ingame? Also answer to your question is yes and it the drone damage amplifier something that I have to activate and also when Exactly should I use the Armor Repairers? If I get one shot in seconds is there even any point.
---
It's not the outcome. It's just that if you like shooting stuff, you're probably going to want to move somewhere else after a while. A C2 with a C3 and HS connection isn't as good for ISK as a C5 or combat as C2 N/5. Syndicate is less profitable to live in than any SovNull region. Low-Sec Campus has a habit of dying out due to low activity every few months too.
---
So the people who end up staying forever are mostly the ones who own at least one 0.5 Athanor and a couple of Orcas. Because there's no corp in HS where you can do that better, thanks to sheer number of Athanors. So if you're going to do that you're never going to feel like it's time to move on and join a different corp which specializes in your preferred activity. The intended (and usual) outcome is that someone learns how to fly competently, with more game knowledge than just how to anchor and F1 the called targets, before moving onto another corp. That's why, if you look at the people in leadership positions, you'll see that a lot of the ones who focus on PVP have left the Uni and spent time somewhere more focused on PVP before returning and there's a much higher turnover among them as they leave for elsewhere (examples: this year, two managers left for Ehefkae, one left for TGRAD, an assistant manager joined WAFFLES last week), while the less PVP-interested leadership is typically people who have been around for years.
---
This is a super good video ... Nice Work
---
the key is that they aren't different from anyone else, they're here for the same reasons other people are here
---
not all bitter people quit, most haven't
---
Cerb is ok but like you said - it’s application. Then also tankyness. Sacrilege seems to be the goto for T5 dark cruisers. Gila for everything else
---
So I joined Horde as a vet but really like the feel of it, new players (newbeans) are welcome, provided with help and advice and encouraged to come out on fleets and get involved. Lots of people online and specific programs and people to help you and explain things. I am sure the other groups also have similar systems as well.
---
Snuff is beating a dead horse
---
It's easy to call people cheating and that sort of stuff "Communist" "Chinese", until you realise people in Wall Street break rules for their personal gains all the time. Even the US president had some questionable behaviours in the past and they are only barely legal.
---
It's a universal thing and happens everywhere. You are probably gonna say the Chinese do it more than Westerners because it's their culture and you are totally not racist... But to be honest, don't you recognise that FRT has a questionable leadership and they don't even represent all Chinese players? Their behaviour had disgusted a fair share of Chinese players as well, that's why Mango exists and communities in Legacy/GSF exist. Having them as the representative of Chinese players is probably the greatest affront to the players that don't agree with them.
---
As the person making the claim, or observation, as you say, you wouldnt be the best judge of whether or not its shitting on them. That may not be your intent, but intent here doesnt make it better.
---
Petition CCP to get rid of character attributes and skill bonuses.

If you want integrated graphics then a Ryzen Apu is the lowest I would go, it will run a couple of clients at max settings easy enough

Get rid of overview so we can manually pilot our ships like it was meant to be.

What if I want a wet towel tank? Does this require I stuff both ships into a blender?

Ah I never knew CCP added caps to the game for the sole reason that the art department would love em.

Got back into Eve recently and found a nice deserted corner of lowsec to live in. I'm planning to use the local area for moneymaking and use my wormhole connections to hunt. 
---
What are some good solo pvp ships for this?
---
Yes! And please, why is it when I repackage a fit ship do the modules not also get repackaged?! I mean, does anyone ever repackage a ship and not also intend on repackaging the modules???

Yea you just throw all 4 recons into a blender then microwave it
---
Well there is a DJ name and he has a soundcloud. I expect some generic disco electric that most people can enjoy. You have to pay for your drinks and it probably stop at around 0000 or 0100. But that is just my guess.
---
How I tell my pilots in RvB ( shameless advertising)
---
1) Set death clone to citadel of Choice.
---
2) When you log off at night swap to plus 5’s
---
3) Login swap to empty clone and go off on your merry way.
---
4) You should have a route set out if you doing null if not get good and make one.
---
5) Drop off loot at npc stations on the way. When finished,
---
Ether burn home with the potential isk in your hold.
---
Dock up in npc station install empty JC leave your ship there. If it doesn’t have a Medical bay just jump back to your +5. If it does have a medical bay install JC. Self destruct your pod. You now back at your plus 5s.
---
6)Swap back to plus 5s log off.
---
7) log back in ether jump to your clone you left in null or swap to empty clone and go again.
---
You said you were doing null exploration so you spend some isk on astra and clone bay.
---
If you see others out on your route invite them to use astra aswell charge v small fee for Jc. You will make more isk.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Eve online Source - you can find it on amazon by dark horse publishing.
---
15-year veteran here. I have quit the game, I have been banned from the game for a couple years, and I have come back to the game usually within Cycles.
---
 
---
I want to highlight the cycle part. Many of my veteran friends are not active because they are in between Cycles. This means they are unsubscribed, but still follow the game and will likely return to the game at some point during the year.
---
I have no doubt that many other veterans are similar to this and maybe have longer Cycles. During this time they may also follow Reddit and post about it. That's because it's exactly what I do when I'm not subscribed.
---
Is this a bad thing? I would say not. Losing all your experience as likely a very bad thing. For example, even though the chief is not on the hunt it doesn't mean he can't direct the tribe due to his old age.
---
Just pick one at random and join it for a week. Then pick another and join that for a week. Repeat until you’ve made up your mind. 
---
All of them are very good, at least the big ones. People will tell you to join a good new player friendly Corp that is small, but those barely exist and even if you find one it won’t have the resources to actually help you get started. 
---
My advice is to join different big blocs, if you don’t like any start looking at big FW corps, and once you’ve got your feet underneath you then start looking into the smaller corps.
---
Had to heavily edit because my recording software was giving me terrible lag in game and locking both clients up through the 40min fight.

---
GF nerds
---
I thought so too at first. But then I remembered how bad these things are at tracking frigates. If they start moving before you can start locking you'll probably hit for really lousy damage.
---
Hmm, that's interesting, that explains a lot what i was experiencing last weekend.
---
I'm not so bothered about the 'effects.JumpOut' thing, a real person can see that too (gate flash/wormhole splash).
---
It's just a common saying. Comes from people using trick coins, where both sides are identical.
---
What exactly is the problem with that?
---
but the defender is usually on a clock and forming what you suggest probally means no response.     Especially if you have to burn to the system in question.   
---
It been the thing many of the hunters on here forget.   They come prepped for the fight they want to fight.   While defenders have to go what is it where is it and yadda yadda.    All of which takes time.
---
I'd say that maybe we get that later, after CCP has had a chance to review and test.
---
For those not willing to read all of this it looks to be a high-security only ganking guide written by someone who clearly has never left high-security space. The fundamentals of what ganking really means is sorely missed in the documentation mostly because it only focuses on be minority amount of really bad Pilots that only live in high-security space.
---
The fact it's colours is new but in- and outbound gate activation has 'always' (for some years at least) had a different animation.
---
To be fair, that depends on your line of work.
---
Try some t1 cruisers; thorax, omen, rupture are all engageable yet powerful
---
The guide is well written.
---
There certainly is a warp sound, idk if it's that event that triggers it.
---
Hee hee hee
---
oh no my 20 bil ship can kill your kestrel, ignoring the fact that each flight of fighters costs more than your kestrel. It's a really simple fix don't stay on grid with them. A super without support will die to a 15 man ass frig gang super hard (assuming they have bubbles), if they have logi you wont even kill any before they defang and murder you
---
Horde just announced a thing where you must sell ice to alliance at 85% Jita buy and the Alliance will sell topes back to you at 100% Jita sell.
---
EPIC WTF
---
Depends, sometimes they are worth it.
---
Horder pilot here .. I was there in a logi loki I boarded the horder so we could check the cargo then i just left in space which is why it shows up but i was very much there lol
---
I dunno who came first honestly. Not that it matters: Eve is a meta heavy game (my original point btw), so when one entity has a good idea it's just normal other entities copy it v0v.
---
why are you engaging massed supercarriers with a subcap fleet.
---
The DDA is passive. Use the first armor repper when you get low on shields, and then use it as much as you need to to keep yourself near full armor. Only use the Ancil if you're still losing HP with the first one going. Given that the Loki's Drones are what appear on the killmail, you probably actually took several seconds to die and in the (entirely reasonable) panic of the moment it just felt like you got 1-shotted.
---
(then again it was a Loki, so if he was using 720mm Artillery you probably legit did get 1-shotted; and yeah there's kinda nothing you can do about that. This is a fit intended to fight other Asteros; if it bumps into a cruiser it's gonna have bad time, and so against cruisers your primary defense is just to escape before they can lock onto you.)
---
The EULA is (intentionally) super vague and what you get as a response is going to be different depending on who in CCP you speak to and even when.
---
The general idea is that something isn't "botting" if it's doing a series of task a player can do, in the same time, as a one-off or very irregular thing. There's no automated gameplay or advantages over other players involved there, so nobody has any reason to really care.
---
&gt; Can you even repackage faction or t2 crystals? I expected not.
---
You can not, since ammunition doesn't have a "packaged" state. It's always the same item, just most can stack since they're identical items but laser crystals can not.
---
Dankest comment today. Sex me daddy Yonis pls.
---
It's legal in China to cheat on tests in school. It's even hard for me to see that their is many examples of dishonesty in China. They do not have the same sense of honor and morality as we do.
---
What ones?
---
It's not even really the bosons you have to worry about if you have command dessies you just boosh out of it. HAW dread for sure you are right. But i mean battleship fleets haven't been a thing forever (outside of machs/nightmares which are basically cruisers) its not just haw dreads that stop BS its bomb bombers and HAC fleets. BS are just in a really bad state ATM and i wish they could get some love.
---
No more buttons please. Just make this a part of the repackage button.
---
Yeah had this in my head also... 
---
Both are good... However this one might just be better imho
---
This is literally unbelievable. "Don't send information that clients shouldn't have" is like rule 1 of online game design, but *printing the information you shouldn't have in a log accessible without even hacking the client* is a new level of retarded.
---
Yeah I also thought about this song...
---
This one is better imho
---
Except we have never had them in this amount, it is completely unseen before. Also are you really claiming supers/titans should be as strong as when there was only few of them?
---
Depends what you're looking for since smaller corps in my experience tend to specialize more than larger ones. Feel free to pm me if you want to hear my plug for the lowsec pvp focued corp I joined, but look for one that's involved in activities that interest you. The in game recruitment tool is pretty good, and the r/eve discord has a pretty solid recruitment channel too.

Most definitely. They’re pretty good about not turbodunking smaller gangs with caps (unless you’re hitting structures/rorqs/supers obviously) and bring good fights

The gain of 90sp/hr is not worth the investment especially if it’s going to be on a clone you’re not running 24/7. And then if it IS in a clone you’re playing at all times, you run the risk of losing a billion isk over 90sp/hr.
---

Ham-fisted.
---
"who gives a fuck"  I agree with you here.  
---
But know that people who spend their time thinking others are racist, or who feel they must excise any racism in themselves, are FULL of an obsession with racism.  They will in fact point out to people who spend no time thinking about racism that this, in and of itself, makes those people racists.
---
They also have little to no understanding how racist this makes them.

---
"roaming" i don't think that word means what you think it means. Lets not kid ourselves 500 man stuka fleets don't roam. If bigger numbers automatically win is how you expect EVE to be then i'm not really sure i want to play that version of eve, it sounds pretty boring. IDC where you go if you bring a 500 man stuka fleet you aren't gonna get a 500 man response, its just not realistic that you form that many sub caps with no warning in the 5 minutes it takes for a rorq to come out of panic.
---
Someone to compete against code?
---
This please.
---
Dear CCP,
---
Okay so I’m only a small time player who’s been on a break, but I have recently (1 week ago) re-subbed 2 accounts specifically to try out spooky black ops stuff in this new blackout/chaos era...
---
I have just set the skill queue on both accounts with a year and a half’s worth of cloaky type skills..
---
So CCP to my question. It can be summed up thusly:
---
“Why in the name of all that fucking holy am I not un-subbing again tonight!?”
---
I apologise for the language. But I truly felt that my question lacked the honesty of it’s attendant passion without doing so.
---
Have a good day sirs/madams.
---
That's incorrect. You don't have to sell anything, you can reprocess your ice or ship it to Jita if you want. The price offered now is also the same as was previously offered by a private buyback to the best of my knowledge. The only difference is now you can't operate a private ice buyback, which is hardly relevant in a discussion about exploiting newbies.
---
lol fuck off, you're acting like your bank accounts were compromised or something
---
embarrassing
---
&gt;You're a great example of a carebear
---
Hahaha.
---
I don’t think I’ve ever once been called a carebear in my EVE career. Thank you for the laughs.
---
&gt;your antisocial behavior
---
Talking with my corp while I mine is antisocial?
---
&gt;The lesson is, if what you're doing doesn't command your full attention, then you don't enjoy it, and you're not really playing the game.
---
I enjoy drinking coffee. But it doesn’t command my full attention when I do it. Does that somehow mean I’m not drinking coffee??
---
The amount of attention given to a task also involves how much attention is *required* to perform that given task. 
---
Now, do you have actual arguments to present?
---
Please help! I’ve overdosed on cringe!
---
&gt;Sounds like a great way to identify bots.
---
it's not
---
If you bring 100 corms against a 500 man Stuka fleet the corms will die doing minimal dmg to the stuka fleet (yeah ok you might trade positive but it wont matter cause ...) and the rorq(s) will die you don't just have to fight the other fleet in attrition you need to own the field and have faxes ready to rep the rorqs.
---
You aren't rich enough yet! Serious answer though, I have a clone of +5s that almost never gets used. Either because I am doing something stupid out in null sec looking for fights, or I am in my super waiting to drop on someone in Delve (yeah, my main is my capital pilot), or I am flying some nano shit and I need to be in my snakes, or I am flying my active shield loki and I need my crystals, etc. Given that, I literally need to remember something like "I am going away for the weekend, I should jump into my +5s before I go..." 
---
And I am an old man, so you can probably guess how often that happens; that being said, I do not have to be your example. Citadel swapping between clones makes it much easier to jump in and out of implants on demand, and if you aren't like me and constantly need to implant swap based on the ship you're flying, you could pretty easily have your set of exploration implants and your set of +5s and, as long as you make it back to the citadel, just swap right into them when you're done roaming.
---
So the game wasn’t originally meant to have local in nullsec?
---
You are crazy. That's not what either of these bugs are. Go try it using OP's steps.
---
RMT confirmed.
---
It’s a recolor of the capsuleer day XV, even goes on the same ships
---
on the other hand intel let people form to fight ya also.
---
And then you have to look at the XP you’re investing to use that +5 implant. With +4 implants and attributes set to maximize SP/hr for cybernetics V, it would take 10 days and half a million XP.
---
It would take almost 293 days for you start receiving gains on that investment in terms of skill points.

yup i agree there should be no way to save rorqs except by forming a 500 man fleet in 5 minutes. In fact we should get rid of rorq mining entirely. That way no one will ever be a threat to goons because they kicked out the ladder. /s

Then those super pilots got very lucky, or your boosh got scrammed in spool. Aiming bursts is an awful UI which accentuates the inherent difficulty in landing a burst on a stuka fleet. It really is a hard thing to do even if you are good at it.

---
Yep. 4 miners and 2 Orcas here. Lots of management going on.
---
Ore holds fill pretty quick, so moving the ore to one Orca then to the other Orca, watching for Triglavians, keeping an eye on Local for known gankers (CODE. Isn’t a problem for me cuz I have permits and donate Catalysts from time to time, but there’s some edgelords near where I live), ore drop off, engaging in bumpwars... there’s a lot of little things that go into it that constantly call for attention.
---
I don't recommend mining as an alpha. Or even an omega, for that matter, unless you've trained long enough (years) for that.
---
The fastest way to get lots of ISK as a beginner is to explore in null or wormholes.
---
If you join a big enough nullsec corp, ask to salvage behind a carrier. It's APM intensive, but an excellent starter.
---
The following requires a lot more time and ISK, but all are decently alpha-able. In order of preference:
---
- Marketing
---
- AFK Domi-ratting
---
- Incursion running. (you'll be asked to upgrade to T2 guns when you can, which requires omega)
---

I mean, they're fine if you've got the isk (who doesn't these days) and you're not flying with them. If you have the patience to fly to your home citadel and swap in and out of them all the time, its hard to say they just aren't worth it.
---
&gt;s going to be on a clone you’re not running 24/7. And then if it IS in a clone you’re playing at all times, you run the risk of losing a billion isk over 90sp/hr.
---
I am rich enough that this is worth it.
---

no i get that not all bitter people quit. im specifically talking about the ones that quit or made a huge public spectacle about quitting and then continue to post here. like, dust off and move on.
---
i quit playing TF2 but I don't go bitching and moaning about how the latest patch fucks with heavy or whatever.
---
O.. Okay?
---
I made a comment about how it’d take around 270 days to get gains from the SP investment for cybernetics V. Not flying with them 24/7 would increase that time drastically, making them even more of a waste of isk.
---
Kikimora, hecate
---
I was thinking of adding more miners to my setup. Hopefully when I build my gaming PC.
---
I have 32 billion ISK or so in my wallet.  When I explore, or travel outside hisec, I leave my implants in a clone.  When I lived in nulsec, I left my implants in a Fortizar whenever I undocked.
---
Whenever I forget, I get podded.
---
Rarely do I ever suffer a loss of any kind when I'm being cautious, but it is as certain as the sun rising that something will go wrong if I'm not.
---
It is an expensive lesson / reminder.
---
no. it's a weird minigame now, a bit like minefield.
---
There is none so blind as he who will not see. Rationalize as you must.

---
This isn't tinfoil at all.
---
Devs giving advantages has happened,and this is a glaring oversight to the point you can't argue no one thought it could be exploited.
---
Try /r/evejobs and see if you see a corp that piques your interest. Don’t be afraid to ask questions like how many people are on in your tz, what is their balance of pvp vs pve, what kind of support is there for new players, etc. 
---
Don’t feel like you have to settle with your first corp either. Treat it like dating. If it’s not a good fit it isn’t personal. Move on and find a corp you have fun with and get to do the things you enjoy
---
Not sure looking at killmails is the best place to go for fitting advice.
---
So no argument then, and you can’t address the arguments/questions I raised.
---
Nice roleplay tho.
---
I mean if you’re that rich, you’d probably just be better off training biology V, getting the implant that boosts the length of booster, and running the master at arms booster which would be boosting your SP/hour by 900. Which is 10 times the SP earning.
---
Or balls deep, +5 implants, with 50 hour master at arms boosters.
---
I will add the obligatory comment here on not attempting to Plex an account, it’s hard and could become way too “job like” to actually enjoy.  
---
With that said, EVE is a sandbox, try it out if you like and see if plexing an account works for you.  
---
But not mining, please not mining...at 10M ISK/hour (?) you will spend 200 hours a month mining.  
---
So, try Exploration...active, engaging game play as you scan down sites in WH space or Null and do the hacking mini game while escaping the clutches of nefarious gankers intent upon your destruction.  And guess what, if they do catch you you will lose a ship that you can replace with 5 minutes of running sites.
---
Hitting on the fresh meat, eh? 
---
But yeah, the great comment at the top lists the big newbie corps but missed Dreddit.
---
No no no, according to /u/J_Hemphill, doing *anything* else while mining means you’re not giving mining your total attention and thus are AFK mining.
---
Also according to /u/J_Hemphill, you should not be antisocial, because that makes you a bot. 😜 🤡
---
As a hated enemy of PL/PH, I can't agree more with this comment.
---
Agreed 100%
---
Excellent guide! Instead of focusing on blowing up belt miners it's focuses on gate ganking autopiloting transport ships.
---
My vote is for 'Brand Newbros', a corp in TEST.
---
I would add that you will make 5X the ISK in Wormholes, and occasionally lose a ship to gankers...find your acceptable risk level.  🙂
---
Oh now THAT sounds great.
---
Create four extra accounts.   
---
put one in each bloc.  
---
on the fifth day, rest.
---
No, you don't.
---
What you need to know is that it's been brought to our attention, and it's being addressed by the development team.
---
&gt;  Once people finally pull the trigger, most of them won't come back.
---
There's family, kids, life to live. You only get so many summers - so if the games not being developed for them, there's just better uses of time on this rock right. Plus, you'll probably be able to buy subs for $5 a month if Hilmar gets more desperate - its not like he can fire all the employees - since they're gone already. 
---
Hilmar needs to make millions appear or he gets half as much money for his interest in the company. It will be interesting to see him either elevate EVE or burn it to the ground.
---
CCP doesnt hate capitals StainGuy. They just hate you.
---
Don't knock it till you've tried it.
---
I’d like it if when the target is dead, and the turret is still on cooldown, I can still click on the icon to queue up ‘start shooting the next target when ready’.
---
Having to wait and monitor when the turrets are off to click the icon, then wait until they actually shoot to see any change is just a horrible experience and often because of lag or impatience I’ve deactivated it as soon as I’ve activated it, and if there’s a lot of chaos I might not notice for a ling time that turrets are off.
---
Let me click it right away, update the turret icon right away on the selected target, then change it to green or another color or let it blink when it’s started firing.
---
This would make so much difference to me.
---
Which one is the best fit for a generic new pilot? Could be any of them. Next time try including some information about your goals.
---
Not in their *late* 20s. The average age of EVE players in *2006* was 27. So unless the core demographic suddenly skewed much younger in the intervening 13 years, and all of those 27 year olds quit and/or didn't get any older, I will state again...   
---
Saying people aren't logging in because of 'college' given the core demographics of this game is kind of dumb.   
---

---
"Bad" is an opinion on which we may differ. A bug or defect is a discrepancy between the intended implementation and the actual result.
---
Where else would you suggest?  In most cases zkill will give you an idea of the typical fits for a given hull, which are the typical fits for a reason.  It'll get you on the right track at the very least.
---
Maybe diminishing returns on systems controlled, or the cost of maintaining systems goes up as you control more systems?  Obviously though, you could just create alliances to avoid this..

Looks like a nice highsec ganking guide. I did not read most of it, but I'd add to the Tornado description that it allows you to gank in 0.8+ gates (e.g., between Perimeter and Kaaputeenen) which are quieter. Gank Vexor is almost the same I used a while ago.

---
the one line to instantly spot retards... best part is, that its always the linemember crying because they dont want their supers nerfed which they have rattet for hundreds of hours... basically every good fc/super fc is the opinion that supers are to strong.. 
---
so first steps to be not as bad as you are now..
---
- download pyfa
---
- import different doctrine fittings
---
- check how well supers (heavy fighters, titanguns) apply to them
---
- calculate how they apply with multiples on grid
---
- calculate how many logi you would need to catch super-targets, or at what point logis become useless because they get vollied
---
-realize that while able to apply as good, fighters also go 10k m/s while webbing/pointing
---
and after that, hopefully also realize that supers are infact way to strong as they are now.
---
 if you dont. id like you to explain to me WHY supers are used to fight off basically everything that tackles anything in your space.
---
if they are bad they shouldt get used at all right?
---
You need to git gud if you can't do both..

I know that I personally quit a few months ago, even before the blackout. But I will say that I participated in both PVP and PVE, enjoyed the industry aspect of Eve heavily, and have been strongly influenced by the blackout not to get involved again. Shaking things up is a great thing for Eve, but I think it has too heavily pushed the PVP aspect of the game at the expense of those who enjoy industry. There needs to be better balance or you will see more decline in player numbers.
---
They're not designed to do what they're doing now otherwise they wouldn't be talking about nerfing them.
---
Ehh noo. Chance and randomness are too close to eachother to say that. Atleast on the level we are discussing.
---
The higher the risk, the higher the chance of something bad happening.
---
This is on top of the fact that you cannot effectively counter cloaked ships in a no local environment meaning your knowledge is irrelevant. I.e., for the defender its chance based and player behaviour most assuredly have random aspects to it. You take that gate instead of this gate and you end up finding a target. This is what chance means. Its no longer a game of skill, its a game of odds of someone taking one gate instead of another. Odds of someone dying before they can reach you.
---
If it was skill, you could do something about it before getting tackled. And yes I know youre gonna pull the BS about scouts and shit which is so easy to disprove that Im not going to take the time.

A lot of people have asked about what the past of EVE's retention rates looked like in 2010-13, and I can't find any data there, but what I did find was this study which puts the retention rate over 5 months at 25%~ over 6 months.

People believe that CCP is at fault for blackout so they call them on anything CCP may or may not be at fault at.
---
Angry kids are just that stupid.
---
There were a lot of client checks that were used in place of server checks to reduce load on the server.. Such as not being able to start locking while someone was in warp... And if the cyno you are jumping to is valid.
---
I'm fairly sure that 10 years ago multiple big alliances were jumping JFs to convert cynos.
---
Those were all fixed now though, and ccp stopped offloading most of the server work on to the client when they introduced time dilation.
---
Boosh are. I said that. Bomber efficiency is secondary. The glass cannons are no longer glass cannons and they're hyper evasive. Oh. And they're dirt cheap. If they weren't so significantly better than all other options then bombers would not be so prominent. But they are. And people refuse to use anything else. So something is clearly out of balance. They hit WAY above their weight for pocket change. And aren't forced to commit to anything. Even losing the whole fleet is of no consequence.
---
What a bunch of lies! PH is THE place to go! Stop messing with this newbro's mind!
---
&gt; No he can't. Nobody can prevent bugs from happening.
---
Are you being serious or is this a troll?
---
I'm confused by capital parts needed to build capital ships.. using one for example, Capital Ship Maintenance Bay-- a Phoenix blueprint indicates it requires 16 to build the ship, so if we look at the Capital Ship Maintenance Bay blueprint, one run equals 1 part. So that would mean I need to run this blueprint 16 times to get what I need for 1 Phoenix?
---
This question comes from trying to see how many total hours it takes to build all the individual parts and I was amazed at how long it takes to build one Phoenix. 
---
Am I interpreting this information correctly?
---
It can also be something introduced recently in order to debug some specific bug in the client, eg the one that makes ppl lose complete control of their ship.

Down voted, but am I wrong? Did I just not read a slew of threads about removing asset safety and how this is just what the game needs? Did I not argue, you will keep long time break takers from coming back? How would no asset safety have affect the OP exactly? He would have came back to nothing.
---
You raise a good point. I can’t read Hilmar’s mind as it pertains to Hellmar’s motivation.
---
Lol I see youuuu Slynn.
---
CCP's rate of feature execution should be a guide to what you can expect from them.  To wonder at the lack of core changes and slowness of execution while at the same time expecting them to implement a huge new form of game play... essentially a new game within EVE... in any sort of reasonable time frame seems contradictory on its face.    You can't say they are crap at doing things and have the solution be something that they probably can't manage because they are crap at doing things.
---
So you own a toaster?

It's bad bait since everyone knows it's so tanky

[Here](https://imgur.com/torcoZ0) is a nice reference sheet to help you recognize various cannon models.

I’ve tried it. It’s hilarious and if you need a long guide to understand it you need help
---
Well obviously I'm quite happy in Horde, but extolling the virtues of one group only is an excellent way to turn a newbie's question thread into yet another tiresome slap fight about whose space tribe is better.
---
As you are stupid and not trolling I will explain this for you. This is not a bug... This is a design flaw and not a unexpected bug. 
---
A Bug would be if you decloaked randomly without any interaction.
---
Also from Dev to Prod implementation you usually have minimal steps to check for certain probable issues related to the change. 
---
My "ask" was will this be added to checks when anything that involves a change to interactions with cloaking etc in the future.
---
As you are insulting I won't even read your answer.
---
if this sort of shit annoys you dont look up wierd-al. The amount of money he makes doing literally this will blow your mind.
---
Oh hay gurl 😘
---
&gt; In less then 20 jumps I got 3 fights last nigh
---
Do you know what anecdotal means? Because the guys touting the actual statistics and population decline do - that's how they avoided this.
---
You’re reading figure 7 right? If I’m reading that right, an important caveat:
---
The retention rate started at close to %70 in 2003 and over the course of 2-3 years dipped down to roughly %18 (I think).
---
Ahh! Mind tricks! Proceed...
---
Aha, that I was aware of that, I didn’t know end of October is the time.
---
I don’t know whether it will have been as successful as that and whether that helps meet the targets.
---
It’ll be interesting to see.
---
You need Archeology/Hacking V to use T2 analyzers. I'm not sure how viable it would be without bonuses either. I'm not sure how a vaga will fare in C3 sites as well
---
Karmafleet, brave newbie, eve university, dreddit, pandemic horde, the rogue university, are all good choice imo. Try one and enjoy learning eve ;)
---
Everquest did this on their progression servers once. They spawned a rare raid mob under the world, so the only way you could know it was spawned was by using illicit tracking tools, and then kept logs of everyone who interacted with it and banned them
---
Lol funny ;)
---
24Hour clock WHEN?!
---
Well that's one way to deal with astero/bomber gankers.
---
These are really fucking well done. At least the ones that don't use other voice actors... But I do appreciate the effort
---
Greed is going to bury the whole humankind.

Better hope CVA doesn't find out who you are. Are they still anti-pirate?

yeah, but a t1 fit rifter gets old after awhile.
---
link pls
---
None. 
---
There *are* no "noob friendly" big corps. They just use you for a cog.
---
Join EVE Uni, or join a newbie friendly small corp. You'll make far more friends and get a much more interesting experience.
---
Sooo okay, apparently you really are retard.
---
It s just to learn the basis; he wont be married with his first corp ;)
---
All of this corp are used to teach the noob, so why not try.
---
The best way to practise and learn pvp after he knows the basic it s to go pvp alone. You learn a lot ;) and when you see the adrenaline rush of hunting and fighting solo; fleets and small gang looks so boring compare tp that!
---
Snapdragon 808, 4x Cortex-A52 + 2x Cortex-A57 and 3gb ram, makes my phone laggy here and there..
---
Looks fancy tho, didnt find my pilot service/omega expiration date and would be neat to have some indy/pi stuff like some other eve apps but for a beta build, rather nice i guess
---
You are giving CCP Support way too much credit, I literally sent a ticket asking them to update my SISI clone to omega status or at least tell me how to do so myself.  After 2 weeks I got a 1 page reply summarizing why they cannot help me.  All they had to do was tell me to open the PLEX store on the test server.
---
&gt; Ehh noo. Chance and randomness are too close to eachother to say that.
---
They are not. They are completely different things. 
---
&gt; Atleast on the level we are discussing. The higher the risk, the higher the chance of something bad happening
---
Yes, we are discussing probability.
---
&gt; you cannot effectively counter cloaked ships in a no local environment
---
- you can warp off when you are aligned
---
- you can rat in stationary &lt;+/-4 sec align time fits 
---
- you can kill them with anything (even T3s) in scram/web range that delivers enough DPS to achieve 20 mil ticks. (otherwise MJDs are a thing for everything battlecruiser and up) 
---
- you can spot them when they enter the system.
---
- you can rat in PvP capable fits
---
- you can establish warp speed/align time optimized doctrines that cover everything in a radius of 3 jumps from your staging within 1-2 minutes with proper discipline. 
---
What you can´t do though is being afk. 
---
&gt; Its no longer a game of skill
---
wrong. it´s a game that raises the skill barrier in a drastic manner from zero to i need to be in front of my keyboard. Not just for the select few people who run the show but for everyone who wants to be successful in nullsec. 
---
But yes, if they want to keep this up they need to adjust the risk vs reward balance, especially for anoms. And in very significant ways.
---
Goddamn I almost paid real money to buy you gold for this. Sadly I'm IRL poor as well as EVE poor so just have this upvote
---
This is some wierd shit lol wonder at what point he moves from big fish in little pond to your bog standard bitter vet.

It's fun to watch someone talking to his own alt
---
Stay salty Shadea Kavees :)
---
Lmao i purged shadea from my old corp for being a shady fuck. Dudes projecting
---
&lt;3 thanks
---
There needs to be a reward to make taking the risk worth it. As it stands now, there is no reward. You can go to hi-sec with 0 risk and make money easier and FAR safer than you can in null-sec. With the chaos changes they weighted it HEAVILY in favor of the PVP crowd.
---
Most people aren't stupid. They aren't going to risk their shiny toys when the chance of death is almost guaranteed. Adapting to this is to outright not participate in PVE in null. For most people, this means only doing fleet ops/passive isk income or not playing all-together. Most of this is tied to the inherent time commitment that Eve has versus the reward of grinding the isk (which, with these chaos changes, has clearly crossed an artificial threshold to not being worth the risk). 
---
Say what you want about nullbears, the fact is that PVE drives PVP content and without it you are losing a major part of the game.
---
As a native Chinese, I can assure you honesty and integrity are very much valued the same way in our society. It's ridiculous to generalize "all Chinese are frauds" just because some dude went back on their word in a video game.
---
Meh just a few softies with easily hurt feelings.
---
In!!!!
---
I think (s)he meant the plural of axis, which is indeed axes, not the tool.
---
&gt; Loyalty is not a necessary quality for a friend
---
Tell me more about your friendship ideas
---
You can fly pretty much anything sub-battleship in nullsec and make your isk back from loot.
---
Well, i'm not living a life in this game so hot EvE RP you know?
---
Both sound like cretins, id say you're even more of one due to typing /emote
---
How could you use t2 hack with lvl4 skills?
---
&gt; PVE in eve is often quite boring
---
How do they fix this, the game is essentially background wallpapers with an overview. They need to make mining peggle or some shit and ratting tetris and the game would improve immensely. But than maybe there's an argument for immersion or something. If you can play 8 tetris at once and not lose efficiency or score than GG you can "multi".
---
1. they are either incompetent
---
2. they are helping the bots 
---
3. they are on hard ass drugs in there
---
I don't know, either are bad but i lean towards incompetent due to recent decisions. Fuck i could probably program there and do a ok job, all i got to do is cut some code out. Considering i cant code my way out of a paper bag i think its a proper statement.
---
I wonder what drugs Hilmar and Falcon are on.... hmm
---
Looks like I have a LOT to learn.
---
Rasta ditched hull pen and became a Chad.

I'm finishing the Mining agent track from the tutorial, guess I'll branch out after that!
---
Wait, so I can drunkbuy all the skins with my PLEX savings from a bar now? Nice.
---
Works like a charm. Slowish as expected on my old ass phone (Galaxy A3 (2016) with Android 7.0). Cheers CCP!
---
/emote shrugs
---
When is Mar5y running 500 man stuka fleets to kill a single rorq?
---
900,000 and it activates the jump timer in a station.
---
Nice link! i cant believe ccp removed them from their site when they redid it ... what morons.
---
\+1 Zendane
---
you're assuming you make it all the way back to wear you started to actually cash in on that loot.
---
CCP being bad, I'm shocked! shocked I tell you!!!!
---
97% snuggly vs 100% snuggly. Fight of the decade
---
Ahh, right! I keep forgetting about that. So I guess no T2 module. Maybe implants instead. 
---
Also, maybe what I'm reading about Vagabonds and C3s is outdated.
---
And then, I guess I could just go ahead and try it out...
---
Holy shit, those stats...
---
Hahaha yeah, you are looking into it since it was found and posted here by a player....geez instead of breaking your heads over -chaos- you would better work on not letting such BS get into the game in the first place.
---
The only proper response lmao.
---
&gt; \[18:56:03\] Shadea Kavees &gt; not even, where were you with all these ops? where was ur activity while u was here? youll never make a decent member, this may well be a game to you but to millions that play, its a career... 
---
This fucking dude needs to get a grip before he shoots up a mall or some shit.
---
were theran ever alive tho?
---
&gt; CCP are idiots.
---
Whelp the ones who knew better got forced out or fired so whoops. If you don't literally swallow his load (read: falcon) than oops you don't need a career.
---
The best type of good.
---
I thought my stats were bad
---
No the plural of axis.
---
It's showing Eve to be the easiest to learn lol.
---
Its a total of 4 I belive. The first 3 were earlier and 1 this year. Anoms have been tampered with multiple times these past months, mining clusters a couple of times the last years. Atleast 2 carrier tracking nerfs, 1 this year. HAW nerfs this year, NSA nerf this year, jump fuel doubling couple of years ago. Just off the top of my head. And certain things that people think are buffs like cynojammers and citadels which both are broken in their own ways. Those are nerfs imo.
---
I dont mind balance but I dont agree that the blackout is a balance thing. CCP Rise even admitted that it wasnt needed, other methods could have been used. Same with the cyno change. They are chosing the worst options because of bias, they want to punish NS and I dont like that attitude.
---
And most def. This is the number 1 thing NS wants as well, we want a reason to fight. I thought that CCP was waiting so they could actually give us a good expansion that would give us a reason to fight. So Ive waited and waited but instead of giving us that they turn around and smack us in the face with this BS. We need 2 things, a reason to fight and mechanics that allow us to fight without burning us out (like fozziesov, like citadel spam, like a million timers instead of actual fighting, like cynojammers).
---
As long as we dont get those changes nothing will become better as you say. Thats the reason behind the stagnation, people have more reasons not to fight than the other way around.
---
The tribute burn cost Panfam like 3-4 trillion isk. And TEST - WinterCO is a big conflict but its quiet. Its the second most expensive war in Eve history. But its been almost 6 months.
---
[deleted]
---
CRIPPLE FIGHT!!
---
lol, for now, just look into exploration. there's still a ton of content with that alone
---
For the w-space combat "relic" and "data" sites, a T1 module with skill level 4 is probably enough. The penalty for failure is not that the can explodes on the second fail, but rather that it *spawns the next wave* on the second fail. So if you clear all the waves of rats first, you can keep trying until you succeed.
---
You panicked hit your afterburner which slowed your warpout. Not exactly perfect.
---
I hear that stuff all the time from literaly anyone not american that i play with lmao. Toughen up buttercup no one gives a shit.
---
Why is it you listed 3 alliances, then a single corp in gsf? Why not just say Goonswarm?
---
You'd be surprised, it's tough to break away from a corp if you've been in it forever. You have your assets tied up in the space and I found that's why I quit last time. I was in PH and found that it wasn't the style of play I wanted but it was damn hard to forge a new path down a road to flying better as a single pilot. But it's what I ultimately wanted for myself. I quit for a while and came back to push on in that new direction. I doubt your first corp will be your forever home, OP, but if it's one thing I can say it's that if you find your current corp isn't working for you, feels stagnant or you want to discover more areas of EVE don't fear the unknown. Follow the direction you want and move corps if necessary.
---
Are you seriosly complaining about newbies not being able to carrier rat?
---
I reacted to a deleted post. My answer is now out of reference. I see how it sounds strange now.
---
 [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chance-randomness/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chance-randomness/) 
---
You cant be aligned since you will drift out of range. 
---
What numbers say and what happens in reality isnt the same. And which fits are even 4 second? And thats if you are perfectly on the ball.
---
MJDs and scrams, sure.
---
Meh, that would require alts on all gates. Who the fk is gonna pay for that.
---
Sure, wont do shit against a fleet tho.
---
1-2 minutes is more than it takes to kill something.
---
Sure you can, wont matter in reality tho.
---
No what you cant do is anything in any real sense without being at major risk.
---
No it doesnt, nothing of what youve said has been about skill. Its been about alts and not being afk. Thats not skill. Skill is to not get caught in the first place. When you can show me how thats done without alts then Ill agree.
---
That wont work. Because in the end its not a risk vs reward issue. Its about about the lack of counters. I can promise you that even with raised rewards you wont get much of the lost people back. It wont stop the bleeding either. Very few I know ratted for isk, they did it cause that was how they relaxed. Having to use multiple alts and all kinds of shit is simply tedious.
---
WHO CARES
---
2004-2005 eve was a rough place, you can check the PCU charts to see the turmoil.
---
OK BUT OP WASN'T
---
Essentially, yes. Remember that you can parallelize, so instead of running 16 1-run blueprints in sequence, you can run them all at the same time. (This assumes you have the skills to run 16 jobs at once.)
---
I was wondering if you meant all of Villore Accords being AUTZ or just your corp.
---
People in null do not get forced to highsec, they unsub. You'd go lowsec at best. The safety is not the appealing bit, its the reward and there is little reward in null space. 
---
Not everyone is going to buy plex to sell or participate in the sanctioned RMT ccp is peddling.
---
No. Can you read?
---
what about playing a space game seriously leads you to believe this person will become a murderer without intervention?
---
The other responses are a little premature. The first question to ask yourself if you aren't already committed to a particular ship is:
---
What do I want to fight against?
---
This will tell you what properties your ship will need to have, which in turn will tell you what ship(s) are good choices for you.
---
Pillow fight!
---
What a self-important douche. Judging by his killboard, he couldn't drop caps on anything if he tried.
---
Isk per hour increases as your knowledge of how to make isk expands. This happens largely by exploring other methods and playing the game. Made 1.2b this weekend exploring for a couple hours a night. The isk is out there if you investigate how to find it. Before exploration I did high-low sec escalations found a few modules to sell for 100m+. Much much more entertaining than nullsec anom running. Love that EVE provides so many ways to make isk. So much so that I could never really recommend a mega null corp because that's what you'll be doing for hours at a time. To me, that's very boring.
---
Wow 18% is still pretty high compared to where we are now holy moly. If you compound that over the years steady at 20% retention I can't imagine how big eve would still bem we'd probably be hitting 50k log ins on avg
---
They still care. Buddy got a 3day ban recently for having a doubleclick script he used for something mission running related (decline spam? not sure).
---
You can bind any key to any action, you cannot bind a key to multiple actions. Simple as that.
---
Is that possible?! Isn't it limited to 10 on a character?
---
Which NPC relic sites are you talking about? The drifter ones? If so, don't even waste your time with them, they're fairly worthless right now.
---
If it's like the pirate faction sites, then you can probably do it (assuming you train your skills to actually use t2 relic analyzer) but obviously it would be sub-optimal. A dedicated scanning ship would be a much better choice (covert ops frigate or astero, or stratios)
---
this is 2019 he injected those caps
---
Yes he was. "Why do unsubbed vets who have quit eve still post here" was the question. I'm talking about those unsubbed vets that have quit eve.
---
cmon globby
---
Stratop, SRP. Fuck I'm glad I left my mega null corp. Nothing exciting about PVP if your ship is instantly replaced when you lose it. There's a reason people get the pvp shakes and their heart is pumping. It's because the feeling of loss is amplified x10000 when it's your own isk on the line. PvP is also that much more rewarding when you fit your own ship that dunks another ship. No better feeling in EVE for me. Yes, you have 1000 people that want to help, other goonies who see eve through the same pair of lenses. I don't think they'd be able to provide accurate information on things that aren't anoms, super ratting or rorq mining.
---
Can we do an actual real cook off?
---
I'm not convinced, that he could drop a cap on his own cyno.
---
Look at that KB and try to say "playing seriously" without laughing. It's how he's interacting with another human, that gives these clues.
---
I used to live in that FEDMART station for a long time. Got so many assets there
---
You mad bro?
---
I'm not saying he doesn't have the caps. I'm saying he has no idea how to use them.
---
I imagine you're probably right.
---
I think you'll find that it's a 4th century Mohist trebuchet. Basic siege engine history.
---
I disagree. I'm in EveUni now and it feels more like its geared towards intermediate players.
---
It's kind of hard to explain but everyone seems kind of involved in their own thing. There's definitely people willing to help, but you kind of have to always go actively searching for it. Which if you have an A-type of personality and are willing to put that effort in, then you will likely have a great time. But if you are on the shyer side or don't love talking on comms, it's really easy to just get lost.
---
It might just be a symptom of a big corp, or going in with the wrong expectations. (I assumed it was more of a teaching corp vs a corp that has some teaching components - if that makes sense).
---
I ended up creating an alt and joining a smaller group at the same time, so I could test both out and I personally really enjoyed the smaller corp more. There was less effort needed to learn and participate.
---
Anyway if you have any questions feel free to PM me.
---
And just to make sure I was clear, I don't think EveUni is a bad corp at all. I just don't think its a great first corp.
---
**this may well be a game to you but to millions that play, its a career...**
---
bot confirmed
---
I have a pretty low end dell with an integrated graphics card that runs Eve fine. As long as I’m at minimum graphics and have it sitting on top of a cooling fan, that is. Otherwise it overheats and shuts down after half an hour or so. 
---
What I’m saying is it’s possible, but far from ideal
---
I see what you're saying, but this is well beyond the scope of "support". This is a game-breaking "security" issue and should have been kept quiet until fixed, just like real-world security issues. 
---
Security researchers and the like privately reach out to developers and manufacturers to allow them plenty of time to fix the problem before going public. Disclosing the security issue publicly before allowing the developer time to fix it just affords bad actors more time to exploit the issue "in the wild", which is no doubt happening in EVE right now. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry that has laid eyes on this thread has their Log Viewer open in game.
---
If the client logs show 1. Whether a ship is entering or leaving through a gate, 2. What ship type it is, and 3. The characterID of the pilot in that ship, please explain to me how you can possibly trick a log-parsing bot into thinking you are no longer present
---
I am genuinely curious
---
I don’t know who of thoses 2 is worse Oo
---
According to other people in this thread, its happened (and been apparantly confirmed) multiple times. soo.. yeh. take that as you will
---
&gt;19:01:25\] Shadea Kavees &gt; to which ill be using my dear locator agents and my cloaky pals to sniff you out... then, you see that corp that ur in? it will be dissolved. trust me on that note, i have PLENTY of people behind me
---
Dude went full "I know people"
---
If you believe shit you read on the internet without a shred of proof, that's your own problem.
---
Citadels are the easy thing. But, there is a point where you just don't care and screw the plus 5's.
---
As I'm in brave newbies, and therefore apart of the legacy coalition, take my recommendation of Brave and Test with a grain of salt.
---
I personally really enjoy the time I spend with my corp mates, but be aware that a member count of 6k doesn't mean that's 6k active every day.
---
Brave Newbies, Tests Brand New bros, karma fleet, and pandemic hoard all offer different flavours of the same stuff, and depending on your timezone should help you choose where you go of you want one of the big corps.
---
If you want to go into industry, pvp, or just rat, the big alliances will all be the same, doctrine ships, established FC's, super umbrellas, Annd awesome people to hang out with.
---
Jump on YouTube and check out ops from each corp you are thinking of joining, and if they seem like the people you want to be associated with, don't hesitate to join up!
---
I can only vouch for brave and test when I say that the help I've gotten when I have no clue about something has always been top notch, and I can only assume the other big alliances will be the same!
---
Haha the best part is they're talking about caps lmaoooo eve 2019
---
Nice post :-)
---
Ya, I was only thinking of hacking the NPC sites, and just combat in sleeper relic sites.
---
I'm trying to figure out a way to run NPC Relics, C2-C3 combat anomalies (relatively efficiently), with one ship. 
---
I'd like to wander around through W-Space, like nomad style, but I dislike the idea of swapping characters, POSs, or the Orca routes.
---
Also not sure I want to get into the T3C life, I have only hate for the skill loss...
---
Not interested in flying a 1Bill ship around in WHs either.
---
So I was thinking maybe there is a ship that could do it all, maybe not the best, but something that can clear C3 combat sites in 15 minutes or so.
---
I'm starting to think it can't really be done the way I'd like.
---
You don't. What's hilarious is that you think you could previously fool bots by pretending to crash them.
---
I hope you're quitting the game and not just that corp
---
Lol, that's hilarious (I'm a former member of E-Uni).
---
lol  
---
" fighters also go 10k m/s while webbing/pointing"  
---
OK, cause that's totally a thing lol this comment is pure ignorance. It's like me saying my rlml caracal does 800 dps. If you use mwd offensively against small stuff you will lose allot of fighters.  
---
" basically every good fc/super fc is the opinion that supers are to strong.. "  
---
yeah ok maybe against other capitals......... unless you're in a BS/BC or heavily painted/webbed those heavy fighters don't do shit to you and a super without heavies is basically a carrier with more ehp and a little more dmg.  
---
" id like you to explain to me WHY supers are used to fight off basically everything that tackles anything in your space. "  
---
I think your problem with supers isn't them in mass its that you can drop a super and haze off a small gang of like 7 dudes in cruisers. any competent ass frig gang will kite and murder your expensive fighters, any significant cruiser gang with logi will tank your fighters and again de fang you.  
---
Hey newsflash capitals with support are really good because that's what they are supposed to be, if you don't like it go to a different grid, or bait their drop then bubble fuck them and go to a different grid. capitals are really slow and have jump fatigue.  
---
If you ask me its not that supers are overpowered its that rorq mining enabled people to field a shitload of them. But you cant take that out of the game (unless you want to turbo fuck the game like ccp apparently does) because then you kick out the ladder so people can't even compete with your super cap blob
---
The log also shows the shiptype/shipID when they load on grid, as well as the characterID of the pilot. If the pilot has appeared and then cloaked, or decloaked in order to appear, that is also present.
---
So basically you can have a perfect log-parsing intel bot that says "PilotID: 133769420 entered system in Astero, cloaked, initiated warp" or "PilotID: 133769420 decloaked in Astero, activated gate, left system"
---
So am I, from 2012 ish.
---
PI from phone when?
---
Absolutely fucking dunked
---
love you falcon
---
It's higher because Eve was sub only at that time, I'm wondering if they counted the 14-day trials in that?
---
So a guy who loses excavator drones and carriers to NPCs and flies a shit fit cyno tengu, that has 0 history of actually successfully hot dropping anything threatens to hot drop a guy who just joined the game (by the looks of his KB).
---
It's a tough one......
---
I enjoy that as well,  double scram web rocket/blaster nemesis says hello.  :)
---
weird flex tbh
---
I know a lot of derps in Goons that'd do that shit too. A day would not go by without someone bling-jumping to a random cyno and get chewed up by people in Theta comms. :P
---
&gt; You cant be aligned since you will drift out of range
---
changing alignment is a thing
---
&gt;  And which fits are even 4 second?
---
plenty if you want them to be. or need them to be.   
---
&gt; MJDs and scrams, sure.
---
if they are in a scramrange you can kill them no? 
---
&gt; No what you cant do is anything in any real sense without being at major risk.
---
Welcome to Eve? Also getting into PvP scenarios =|=  major risk of losing your ship. 
---
&gt; Skill is to not get caught in the first place
---
Most of the things i mentioned were about not getting caught in the first place. Also: no, that is not what skill in this game is about. pre-engagement decision making is a part of it, yes. That includes fitting your ship according to the situations you might encounter. 
---
&gt;  Because in the end its not a risk vs reward issue. Its about about the lack of counters
---
i don´t hear wormholers complain about a lack of counters. 
---
&gt; I can promise you that even with raised rewards you wont get much of the lost people back
---
i agree. low effort scrubs will be low effort scrubs. 
---
&gt; Very few I know ratted for isk, they did it cause that was how they relaxed
---
There is a place for that. And you know where that place is at. If you don´t care about profit you won´t mind only doing minmal amounts of it. Also i call bullshit on this one.
---
You're using one key press to do 3 sequential actions, it certainly sounds pretty questionable. I agree that the UI is bad and multiselect-cancel would be good though.
---
&gt; What's hilarious is that you think you could previously fool bots by pretending to crash the gate
---
One of the overview-reading scout bots (post-blackout) quite literally had a vulnerability where you could crash gate, jump back through, and the bot would interpret your 3-5 seconds on overview as you warping away.
---
It was posted about on this subreddit and it worked flawlessly in-game for about a week before it was fixed. The bots would return to ratting in 10-15 minutes after the scout bot "thought" you had left.
---
Would love to if my phone was actually compatible .-.
---
That's what we're working on, friend. If this beta still doesn't work for you maybe the next one will.
---
you can asset safety from hostile citadels present in every system
---
I'll have you know I've engaged *multiple* Industrials in my 2+ billion ISK T3.
---
Oh, simple farmers will be killing legacy pilots because we'll be fucking dumb and slowboat through known gate camps when we're being yelled at in comms because we're slow boating through known gate camps
---
This isvlike watching the special Olympics  of eve chat...
---
and that's going to cut into how much you make off of what you asset safety back to base
---
Not compatible to my motorola bag phone from 1987
---
I don't play Eve anymore, but from someone who flew quite a bit in cloaked ships I just want to say "holy crap!" and good find, OP. CCP - you know what to do now... :p
---
&gt; and don't expect to be ISK efficient at the end of it.
---
Yep, with the defending caps always experiencing a few bumps, being  ISK-negative is inevitable. 
---
&gt; Had Goons not been around to take the brunt of the losses, we'd have probably lost a lot more.
---
I was target-calling for most of this fleet and when the goon bomber gang warped to 0 we had a brief moment of confusion before we set the smart bombs off and a good portion of their fleet ate it lol.
---
&gt; And, had the dreads actually coordinated their fire better, 
---
Yes and no.  A lot of the dreads who were soloing ships by transversal were doing quite well. You said it yourself:
---
&gt; I was being targeted by one Revelation, who was able to drop my Kiki down to 25% shield on the first shot, 96% hull on the second
---
Overloading the work of enemy logi is extremely useful in trying to disrupt most fleets and Goku/Stuka is no different.
---
&gt; With 21 HAW dreads on the field, split into seven teams of 3, each team focusing on independent targets, they would probably have been able to split our reps such that they would be able to consistently volley 5+ ships off the field every 4 seconds.
---
I would love this but that would take a lot of work in coordinating sub-comms.  Could be done with experience, though.
---
&gt; And then caught a Nyx and two Nids in a bubble off a Keepstar
---
Man was I pissed about this one.
---
Read/Listen to The Empyrian Age by him.  Soooooo good.
---
I mean even if you count the astra and reitaru you technically still lost the isk war...  I mean good on you for evicting people that broke agreements but....
---
Hes talking about investing in +5s, i think he can still afford it
---
Clearly you should trust in rust and stop flying amarr ships
---
If you want to do it in any way efficiently AND with one ship, no orca or POS, use T3. Skill loss is a small price to pay compared to the flexibility you'd get. 
---
Other than that.. Stratios might be worth a shot, but I think you'd still need to pimp it out to 1B or more for it to tank the sites.
---
Mine now plays eve.
---
&gt;Even our die-hard PVPers are getting exhausted as we ping for a defense fleet several times an hour. We also have not gone on a fun roam in almost a week because the FCs and PVPers are too tired from running home defense. 
---
We have different definitions of "die-hard PVPers" clearly. The kind I'm thinking don't really piss and moan about content being brought to them regularly. Wormholers don't want your fucking space, they want to fight you.
---
pick   hacking bonus implant too and  use integrated analyzer  you can hack with  HAC easy just keep  eye on dscan
---
There is a difference between taking the fight to someone else versus being constantly on the back foot. When you go on a fun roam and whelp a fleet you have a good laugh and say "at least we dont have to burn home". When you whelp a home defense fleet it is a punch in the gut and a huge hit to everyone's morale.
---
C2 is doable in a stratios for sure. C3 might be a bit of a stretch, even blinged out. Now a nestor on the other hand can do it no problem. But it's at around 800 mil just for the ship, so not really what the OP wants if he wants to do it on the "cheap" side.
---
and  your implants
---
&gt; Beamfessors can wreck them
---
A handful of Beamfessors can be an absolute nightmare to no-tank bombers. While the caps are focusing the primary, Confessors can absolutely chew through paper tanked bombers.
---
MotoG5, less than 2 years old, running Android 8. Shouldnt I expect this to be compatible?
---
i just have shiny lif and naglfar..does it mean i should be hated?
---
you cant argue with radioactive man, he's just very set in his ways.
---
Even if the party is meh and ends early, Berlin is a great city to go clubbing and party for an acceptable price.
---
&gt; but you have to accept that due to the innovation of the guys at the top of nullsec they made it too easy for poorly trained, skilled and experienced guys to do well in the game
---
So the ideal situation where we have the highest population. Great critique. 
---
&gt;  The new changes correct that
---
Really dumb development 
---
&gt; shit players out of null
---
Nobody good plays in null with or without the stupid development of null.
---
Making the game more niche and shitty is bad for the game. Even if you think it's "fair" or "equal" or bad players shouldn't be allowed to play or win any video game. It's the dumbest shit you could have written. Profit matters more than your feels.
---
I can give a few examples of 500 man stuka fleets off the top of my head if you'd like? rest assured it does happen, just look at the e7ve fight from a few days ago that v0lta keeps linking because they think it makes them look good. 600 ish vs like 200 ish.   
---
Its about cost and effort relative to performance. First off i don't think bombers are broken yet, if anything its command dessies and kikis that are too strong, seriously kikis are super broken and if you cant appreciate that i don't know why we are even talking. But bombers cost like 50 mil fit, for the cost of a haw dread you can field 60 bombers. If you drop a dread bomb you expect every one of those dreads to die so yeah i do think a 500 man dread bomb is balanced. If you drop a 500 man stuka fleet and everyone dies then you've seriously fucked up, and even then if you kill 4 or 5 caps and some fighters you are still isk positive.  
---
"nullbears" lol i think its funny that you are calling me that since I've spent most of my eve life in WHs and lowsec.  
---
What you are advocating for, a massive NPSI fleet with no real counters (everything that can kill them in a reasonable trade is too slow to actually catch them. Plus no counter for people just cloaking up) and huge amount of mobility (WHs, covert bridges, being frigates) killing capitals that if you want to use them get stuck in place for 5 minutes and take 40 - 60 hours of very boring game play to break even.   
---
Yeah, no i'm good staying on anchor and hitting f1 to club a seal that cant even fight back is pretty boring imho. game play wise f1 monkeys aren't that much different than the people mining in barges, very minimal amounts of effort.
---
Buybacks offered 95%
---
So you want to have your space but not defend it :thonk:
---

Nah Sinpwn came with us when we ditched that sinking ship. He is too deep in the wow classic hole right now though.
---
There's also other routes.
---
Like throwing it at me to raise to CCP privately. 
---
(Ideally with an EBR number. Because that keeps things simple, and means that even if I were evil, CCP would see it. I'm not evil, but as they say, trust but verify)
---
So many salty miners in here, Gankers seem to be doing a damn good job
---
nice guide
---
Hadn't undocked in forever, fun fight thanks for bringing it
---
Pro tip: bring two sets of probes. This way it auto reloads and you always have a new set primed and ready!
---
Frat would disagree with you
---
The benefit is when a player has a bug that CCP can't replicate. Then CCP can get the logs from the player.
---
Can confirm, New beta release is working, cheers
---
Stop shitting on Joifugi.
---
Working for me just fine.
---
Adapt REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
"and you just login out of the blue?" 
---
Yeah how dare you login!? Lol wtf
---
You want to remove capitals from the game? ok cool, im fine with that. Just take precursors shit and covert bridges with them and refund SP. But this dumb shit where they keep buffing one play style and nerfing another is dumb as fuck and tbh is really really lazy game design.
---
Good fight was had. All that matters.
---
&gt;When you whelp a home defense fleet it is a punch in the gut and a huge hit to everyone's morale.
---
Not true. The winners get great morale.
---
So what's your point? "My play style has been ruined"?? That's it? Too bad so sad.
---
I mean trying here.... thats why I'm asking
---
If you instantly ban, then the botters know what caused the ban and can adapt.
---
You ban after some time delay, then they don't know what behavior they need to modify.
---
what? did you even read the post?
---
Well, that's probably why he needs to drop the entire corp on a toon with no kills.
---
Can't Darkness defend them anymore, they only a couple of gates up the pipe in Deklein.
---
No one said he couldn't afford it. What are you trying to argue?
---
11 total, 1 base 5 mass production 5 advanced mass production.  that said I think a lot stop at 4 AMP so they have 10 slots total.
---
You did read it wrong. Thats not the retention rate. That was the player gain.     
---
Retention rate was between 0.8% and &lt;0.2% [Figure 7]

1st Gen pixel xl, no problems running the app since release, but as a feature request can it not be quite so full screen? Hiding the system buttons is super awkward in an app you have to hit back a lot in (while logging chars in at least).

Cool, the tutorials are a great way to understand what you may be interested in pursuing further.
---
give bombers a dmg boost but a nerf to application so they cant hit things smaller than a bs and nerf kikimora tracking, and buff battleships so that they might actually become viable
---
Does it updated Trig HAC? I don ‘ think so....
---
So what you’re saying is
---
Literally everyone hates having to defend BECAUSE “it puts you on the back foot”
---
Your words... the same people say nullbears “cry” over
---
Can someone explain these meme alliance memes? Or is the Dino guys some legit dudes? New player btw
---
Oh wow okay got damn. So we're better now then where we were at?
---
Five on your side right? Because there are three on the Proteus killmail.
---
I don't industry on that scale. I'd assume you would use alts for capital building.
---
Where Sort Dragon? 
---
Why he not defending his shitty meat Shield?
---
Then they are stupid, since ccp is crying about to much power through a normal cyno but doesn't care about stukas through an invisible cyno.
---
I think you may be confused or mislead by old information. If you are trying to kill the sleepers and loot the relic site you will need a bit more tank than what a vaga could provide. Additionally, the scanning in a vaga will be horrible due to 0 bonuses. With that said, I recommend the Stratios with dual reps. You will need good drone skills to be effective but you can definitely tank if fitted right. I would share a fit but currently at work.
---
Well, you can just try it out yourself then! We are multiple people to have heard the same thing.
---
Yes I have noticed more wormholes, no I don't feel bad about it.

Fffffuuuck, you're sad

I'm still legitimately baffled that CCP has never *really* gone hardcore on making a New Player Experience that isn't shit. I've seen so many cool ideas over the years, like starting all new players in a mini-region of "lore" space (i.e. a simulation) where they can experience all of EVE in a microcosm before entering the "real world."
---
Instead I'm still tempted to blow my fucking brains out every time I make a new alt and realize that the game feels entirely unplayable until I use a 3rd party tool to copy my UI/overview settings over from my main.
---
fighter application nerfs, inhib buff, command dessies, kikimoras with op tracking and range to screen fighters/tackle, cyno nerf, rorqual tank nerf, blackout, nsa nerf. It's not really stukas specifically as a doctrine that they've buffed the shit out of but hunting in general.
---
Perfect scanning skills will make for a lot less drudgery.
---
lol bombers bar is a small gang. that's like saying goons have a few capitals. CCP really needs to focus more on forcing fights and less on causing those fights to be one sided. and no 500 bombers murdering the shit out of a rorq with no response is not a "fight"
---
take it back, don't make me cap drop u bruv
---
U wuldnt like me when i cap drop
---
What game
---
lmao. International Universities would like to have a word with you. Also the entirety of online gaming. Also every single volunteer/tefl/etc that works as a teacher in China.
---
Three questions:
---
1. What is the difference between a capital ship and a supercapital ship? I realize that Titans easily qualify for the latter because they're so goddamn huge, but apparently supercarriers are considered supercapital ships despite being only somewhat larger than a regular carrier (relatively, speaking) and unless I'm mistaken they're smaller than Force Auxiliaries, which are *not* considered supercapital ships. So where's the line between capital and supercapital?
---
2. This is probably a "dumb newbro" question, but what the hell. Goonswarm is bored, [they've told us that much](https://imgur.com/gallery/RSFobJx), so why don't they arrange fights with other alliances to give their cap/supercap pilots something to do? They're more than rich enough to afford to lose a few hundred bigass ships in the name of having a good fight, so why the hell not?
---
3. Does anyone know if Gogela (u/gogelaland) plans to revive [his old EvE history site](https://gogela.com/eve/)?
---
Make contracts from phone when?
---
Forgetting to put stuff back in corp hangars is a habit I have that's almost as crippling as my addiction to collecting corpses.
---
I've got mixed feelings about this. Yes, they should have to be able to defend their sov if they want to have any, but I also don't want the blackout to force all small alliances to merge with goons/us to survive in null.
---
you dont see stuka coming. blackout and wormholes. statics need a respawn delay
---
&gt; It's not really stukas specifically as a doctrine that they've buffed the shit out of but hunting in general.
---
thank you for confirming the point you made was completely unrelated to the post
---
Works like a charm on my Moto G7 play, running android 9, unlike the original version.

What
---
Works well on Galaxy Note 8, no issues so far. Octa-core (2.35GHz Quad + 1.9GHz Quad), 64-bit, 10nm processor, 6gb ram, Android version 9.
---
its not even bombs lol torps murder the shit out of subcaps, esp with paints
---
There's plenty of small alliances that are ~~30, flirty, and~~ thriving with blackout. They don't have to form cancer doctrines to deal with "home defense." Wormholers want to get fights like I said, not take space.
---
"leet" pvp is killing people that cant fight back.
---
&gt; Too much effort to maintain space,jJoin goons and just hide under the umbrella
---
Is this the intended result?
---
Crystal use/damage is so fucking wonky. Its a terrible QOL to fuck with. Why not just have t2/faction use charges like regular ammo, and t1 not? Or just have them all use ammo. Crystals are already tiny, you could keep a stash of several thousand with no issue.
---
The hero we need
---
Is this a common sentiment among veteran players?  Why do people not like character attributes and skill implants?
---
Ya, I'm thinking the info I have is outdated. I actually have a Stratios sitting in a hanger somewhere that I could never figure out what to do with. Are you saying that with dual reps, it can take on C3s? 
---
I'd love to see the fit, when you get a chance.
---
idk why people downvoted you, bombers apply too well to subcaps its a fact
---
Fuck it, just delete charge damage and have lasers use charges like every other weapon (except drones i guess)
---
It would also simplify fucking mining lasers.
---
That would be the best bet given the current meta. Not that I think it's good or healthy, but if you burn out from fighting some wormholers who are roaming, lolololol trying to defend your space from someone who actually wants it.

---
QOL, when logging in, the texting UI pops up and covers the password typing portion. Please allow the screen image to "compress" or scroll up to show typing. I'm not software savy so IDK if I explained that right, but hopefully my point is made.
---
Some modules (capital XL size) are way smaller packaged Repackaging the ship only un-fits modules. They may be damaged or something else. Its pretty easy to select all and repackage anyways. 
---
Idk, this just seems not super relavent
---
You guys seeing any issues with the Android 10 update starting to roll out?  I just updated from the Q beta to GA today and so far Portal has been OK since I downloaded it the other day.
---
Also allow swiping right or left on phone to select tabs to the right and left instead of selecting tabs from the top. I know, lazy, but QOL for sure.
---
Repair costs can vary, or the service not even be available, im not sure how applicable this is.
---
No what I'm saying is when you have to defend 24/7 you do not have time to actually have fun in the game, it then becomes a job and then people quit. Apparently thats the end goal for everyone on this subreddit.
---
Repair services can be unavailable, or high cost. Its easy to mass-repair things in the service button.
---
QOL changes are great, im just not sure the use-case here
---
You still going on about that? I know you fulfilled your two-good-posts-a-year quota already, but there's no need to make such an effort on shitposting.
---
Not to sure about the C3’s because the damage is pretty significant. I have done C2’s with a Stratios solo and tanked them fine. The dps on a C3 might be to low which will make the sites take a lot longer leading to your chances of getting caught being much higher. One trick I have seen is blitzing. You take a nano anethema and kite the sleepers off the cans. Then warp back right on top of a can and ninja hack/loot. Rinse and repeat till it’s picked and looted. However the real isk is from the blue loot you get from killing the sleepers so it’s a trade off. The other option is to forget running C2/C3 relics and simply stick to null sec relic sites. They tend to be more profitable and can be done in a super cheap 100m astero. I have day trip through null and came back to my WH with 400m+ in relic loot.
---
TBH if they are a small independent black woman alliance that don't need no blob, the space they live in is so worthless that it's probably not worth taking by anyone. If they leave it will just lie fallow or some blob will take the space and just put a TCU on it and probably not even bother to defend because nobody would want that space anyways.
---
&gt; Personally I haven’t logged in for more than 15 minutes in the past week and that was to redo some market orders and move a super.
---
&gt; I’m going through the stage of bittervet syndrome where I want to play Eve and think of things to get content. I get home and then I don’t feel like sitting around my computer for 2 hours when there’s a good chance I’ll get 0 content after sitting there for hours. So, I unsubbed my 7 accounts for the first time and will let them lapse within this next month. For the record it’s not all because of the BO, I am in a position currently where the money for 7 accounts could be used elsewhere at this time.
---
I don't see any statistics there. Everytime I leave I get content pretty quickly you have to be mindlessly roaming to get 0 content. I can't find anyone thats good at hunting having a issue.

Is it stupidity or insanity

Equilibrium
---
10 bil of bombers can kill plenty of 5 bil rorqs and the defense fleet that comes to save them because you only got 20 pilots that can fly 5 mil corms in the 5 minutes that your panic took to run out.  
---
also, to show how stupid your argument is.   
---
1 trillion worth of supers can melt 10 bil of bombers.
---
Can't buy skins with karma.
---
The only meaningfull downside to using NPC stations is the JC timer. 
---
Not that finding a free player owned citadel is a problem... outside of the risk that the owners unanchor, disable the service, get destoyed, or revoke docking rights to OP and his +5 clone gets deleted.
---
It's useful for bug reporting, giving CCP extra data to work with is never bad.
---
Besides, even if the log viewer was removed, the data is still being sent to the client, anyone with the know-how and patience could figure it out without the log viewer.
---
Any group that small would benefit more from living in NPC since you don't need defense fleets as your crabs run missions, which have an acceleration gate that provides a lot of additional safety. It's not like carriers/rorquals that sit in anoms waiting to be tackled.

it's the end goal for every eve player worth his salt. actually reaching it is the real issue.
---
I wish someone had said this to you before you posted anything.
---
The other thing to note (besides wanting T2 shield tank) is that you need to tune your resists for the mission. Typically fitting 3 damage-specific hardeners is better than using invulns. When I was doing this I carried two of each kind of active hardener, and fitted them according to the rats expected in the mission. T2 heavy missiles are nice but not necessary: don't race to T2 weapons at the expense of missile support skills.
---
how about dont be shit. and just welp a fleet like you mentioned welping while goin on a roam?
---
wormholers live in wormholes. they dont come to your space to ''invade'' you, they come for a fight. give them a fight and theyll leave. doesnt matter if you or they win. and if you are not interested in fights and dont want to defend your ratters while living in NULL SECURITY SPACE then maybe, just maybe you shouldnt live there?
---
Works, but password screen needs some scrollability.

---
Just like you saying I'm arguing against stats when there were none mentioned. Well I guess him saying he just unsubbed 7 accounts could be. 
---
There's no way to argue about time to find a fight unless you just want me to record all my roams duration and compare the fights I find to zkill. If that will make you happy I can do it and forward it to you later.

Anybody that has to tell you he knows people...doesn't know people....
---
Aye that's possible, I might be misremembering the number.
---
Do you really think this?
---
These events brought Eve more players than everything else happened in Eve since it was born.
---
Outside Eve community do you think there's anyone that even know fw exist or any other small gang pvp activity exist?
---
Do the press ever talked about these small events or maybe about the bigger ones and big null "empires"?
---
All these things you Reddit people thrash talking about (F1 monkeys, nullblobs and so on) are the reason why Eve still exists today, otherwise no more "epic" gatecamps or elite pvp hookbill fights...
---
I don't think this dude https://zkillboard.com/kill/77567073/ is a threat to anyone

Did you read [this] (https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Showtime)?

What about my situation? I enjoy PvE, with a itch to learn PvP. But, I don't want to be just another corp number. I'd like to find a corp where I can help build and expand. These already established powerhouse alliances don't seem to be the best fit for me... and frankly, I wouldn't recommend that kind of thing to anyone new. It just makes the journey less exciting.

you know pyfa is a fitting tool and not a battle simulator right? heavy Fighters have travel time and get out run by ab bombers. Heavy Fighters die, reducing effective dps very rapidly and cost as much as a bomber when a squad dies assuming you use t1. But, lets be honest only the galaxy brains like you are shooting the heavy fighters because they do like 10 dps pre resists to an ab bomber (assuming you have enough drone navs to catch them). (ss fighters do way more but i cant tell you exactly how much more because pyfa doesn't calculate the hidden dps penalty ss fighters get when shooting at non drones/fighters) **because yes i did use pyfa even though i already knew you were an idiot**. Tell me more about how op heavy fighters are against frigates
---
We're all so proud of our newest protege ♥
---
dude did you even read? We are giving lots of fights the issue is there are too many. After the 12th defense fleet in a single day where newbros feed and bitterfets get frustrated people get tired and log out and then don't log back in the next day or the day after that. So unless you want there to be 0 fights in the future I suggest you stop being an edgelord and recognize there is an actual problem. Right now the only apparent solution is to join the blue donut and help accelerate the death of the game.
---
My honest answer is there's really no way to defend. CCP plans to balance sov null around the blobs with the level of infrastructure, wealth, bodies, and supers that they have. Mechanically, ratting post blackout is extremely dangerous in isolation. It doesn't pay well so you have to be out in space for a long time, there's no mechanics to give you more reaction time since bombers/T3's can enter the anom cloaked and point with little delay. Thus isn't a big problem in blobs since you are in a 25mil EHP Super, and you can call down additional supers from the umbrella. If you are in a subcap or cap without an umbrella you're just dead. If you fight and feed that just invites more people to farm you.
---
If you don't have the size to scare off attackers, should just move to a place where there are game mechanics to provide safety in lieu of an umbrella. FW and NPC null both have acceleration gates, wormholes have mass limits and you can crit a hole to limit attackers.
---
no it's because whining about being fed content you literally spent no effort getting is the most laughable thing imaginable
---
you should contract all your stuff to Risc Brubal and biomass, you don't deserve the miracle you've been granted
---
null players have grown fat in last few years
---
So just everything in that category that affects probes? Probably won't do many relic sites. More combat stuff if I get my way, even if just ratting
---
ya it seems sad but true, small alliance Null was always the most fun but now it seems like CCP is taking it out behind the barn.
---
You know English is complicated. Specifically they buffed the playstyle which specifically effects stukas, is that specific enough for you?
---
I haven't used lasers much, but I can tell you that from afar they have the appeal of not needing to cart lots of ammo around.
---
Maybe it could be a nice minor isk sink to have an NPC service available on stations to meld used crystals into new ones, at some loss. Or maybe there should be some off the wall advancement industry skill that would let you do it in appropriately equipped stations and structures.
---
Why does this leaked conversation make me want to curb stomp FRT?
---
&lt;Note to self:  Ask shrink about this...&gt;
---
You mean to tell me you dont think the blackout was beneficial to the small guys? 
---
You dont enjoy being over hunted by risk averse cloakies? 
---
The second you log in your show up as a bright light on a map that is largely now dark?? 
---
Leaving the options of disbanding cause of fatigue, or join one of the 4 major blocs?? 
---
The black out is great... great for consolidation.
---
Our policy was always whoever got the initial tackle on a ship got to keep all the loot from it. Plus tacklers were always replaced by the corp. Nano stuff is usually pretty expensive so it's a good motivator to get people into tackling, which is usually the most important part of any pvp encounter especially against nano shit. AFs can work great here and they're easy to fly if you treat them as disposable, just point them at a ship and overheat everything.
---
Besides that people tend to get more invested in actual comps rather than kitchen sink fleets. If a comp whelps it happened for a reason, so you can learn from it and do something different next time. If a kitchen sink fleet whelps who knows why it happened. There's no consistency so nobody feels invested in it, nobody really knows what they're supposed to be doing or how to get better so it's not interesting.
---
If these guys are coming to you then it's pretty easy to bait them into traps. That's not something you can typically do on a roam and it can be a lot of fun. Rather than ping a few times an hour put a guy in a belt, put your &gt;comp&lt; nearby and try to get some loot drops for your guys. One of the best traps I've run into was cloaked sentry drone domis parked like 200km away with AFs close in as heavy tacklers, totally unexpected and really effective.
---
Just some ideas while you wait for the observatories to disappear.
---
Where did I say that at all?
---
But... Isn't buffing one playstyle and nerfing another exactly what you're suggesting they do?
---
You do sound a lot more angry than me here.
---
hey buddy, if you want to do anything that will be relevant and transcend the game, do something that isn't playing the game. Doing something just so you can then tell your friends how much of an 3lite gam3r you are is pretty sad
---
Fuck.. do you think they’d do anything? I didn’t consider that before I posted
---
I mean before this wormhole change it was pretty much 100% positive for us. We took advantage of the blackout which did help us a lot in fighting larger groups. We are too small to get noticed by the cloaky campers and we could defend against roams that did come by. The constant stream of WHs though is just stretching us way too thin.
---
Just put it in the perimeter keepstar. I don't think that will be gone anytime soon.
---
Yeah I don't really know either. I do know lots of corps that would love to go try to carve a few null systems out for themselves but have no idea how.
---
Everything except hacking, archaeology, and survey (I think it's called). That last seems to be of interest only if you're probing moons.
---
I use my old 50 inch and a 42 inch for pc monitors, seemed a shame for them to just sit in a closet
---
Loled
---
Join my corp - I'd love the "content" this nobody claims they will bring
---
Also if you aren't alpha the drake fit with the medium named extenders and everything else t2 will just barely fit a proto cloak in the empty high. But a lone bc isn't very useful in wormholes, you really need a group.
---
DO you know Matteral tho?
---
I dunno man. Been playing eve for 13 years now...
---
I mean, like half the things you listed don't even specifically buff hunting but literally just pvp in ships that arent capitals in general. Did i mention yet stukas are actually a combat and not a hunting/ganking doctrine?
---
What ship are you clearing the sites with?
---
Yeah, instead of % of destruction use 100 of whatever amount of small crystals
---
brb using locator agent on leetmcfeet
---
Moist.
---
Just as people’s most cherished memories in life are rarely remembered by history (your first kiss, your times with your friends, your first day at work, achieving your personal goals), for many players, their most memorable moments are usually not the ones that Eve’s history will remember either.
---
Thanks this actually was very helpful. Ya not just doing kitchen sink fleets we already identified as a big change we need to fix for all the reasons you laid out. Will work on those other suggestions too. Thanks for taking the time to type up an actual response and restoring a little bit of faith in this subreddit.
---
  4. Programming a game is really hard and logging is almost impossible to fully encrypt from players looking to abuse some form of it.
---
Games with much larger budgets and much more robust anti-cheat systems still have cheating problems. Their solution is bannings. You really think CCP can come up with a better answer than studios with orders of magnitude higher budgets?
---
At some point the playerbase has to accept that botting in some form or another is impossible to stop aside from reporting the players and banning them. You can make them less effective, easier to track, but nothing will ever stop them from existing because it is human nature to automate as much as possible of any income process.
---
yeah eve has risks and bad carrier and rorqs died all the time before any of these changes. But, slowly making caps obsolete by nerfing them every couple months is retarded. If you want to take them out of the game just do it and live with it, the fact that they are nerfing one play style to the point of un-usability is a slap in the face to all the people who spent the time effort and money to get into those high sp ships. which i feel is a bit disingenuous since ccp made the problem in the first place with injectors and rorqs.
---
Or instead of wasting dev time on frivolous complexity, they could just simplify the system to work like all the other ammo charges and be done with it.
---
Repackage window may display cost with selectable option to repair damaged modules
---
People? Are there any non-managerial non-outsourced staff left other than Falcon?
---
You can already train skills from the app
---
I really don't know what you're bitching about. The fact of the matter is that stukas are basically the only viable subcap doctrine. So if you think caps are unplayable, how do you suppose everybody who wants to play subcaps feels?
---
open the fleet hangar of that cap and you'll find hawaiian pizza
---
Yeah, same comment for Pixel 2. It's infuriating when apps hide the system buttons.
---
I think you’re a lying sack of shit.
---
“24/7 fights” “non stop wormholes” etc
---
I think you didn’t get to krab the long weekend and this is a tear post about how you can’t be safe 24/7 leaving and how you have to actually fight and defend your space.
---
I bet your a renter.
---
" Did i mention yet stukas are actually a combat and not a hunting/ganking doctrine? "  
---
which is why you see many so many nullblocs running stuka fleets for strat ops /s. Also, i dont think you   
---
know what the word specifically means. The specific way in which stukas were buffed was by several nerfs to the main ships they fight against and a buff to their general style of game play.
---
Great guide, but I don't think the thing about Ship Scanners working better the closer you are to the target is correct.   Also lmao at these comments.
---
Maybe
---
Certainly yes, people still play this game. Is it dying? since ever. Player count is dropping quickly. You can still enjoy it thought.
---
imagine knowing that blackout hurt players more than bots
---
Nah
---
It's exactly why i advocate against joining them. If you "grow up" in an environment where everything is provided for you right from the get go, you don't learn as much as another guy who had to try harder. Obviously there should be a balance in this, and that's why i said "go ahead and join one if you want to kickstart your learning, but don't feel obliged to stick around forever".
---
As for big fights and history, history is made by the people who do cool stuff, but what ends up being remembered depends on who talks the loudest.
---
I was part of the group that scored the first capital ship kill in the game and nobody knows about it, because we were not a megablob. We were just 30 guys (on average) spending every day doing hit-and-runs against an alliance that would consistently field 3 times our numbers or more, and still managing to come out on top in terms of kills and isk efficiency. But just like today, most people in the big blocs were upset that "we were playing the game wrong", we weren't interested in holding sov and we were just "filthy roamers who don't fly big ships that we can catch and kill". Well, sucks for them i guess, because in reality they were just jealous we managed to kill one before they did, lol.
---
Apart from that, your "nobody cares about X" comment is just a common misconception that everyone likes the big stuff. I actually don't care about most of the stuff that you think is cool, it's too boring for me and the fact that it became pretty much mandatory is exactly what made me quit the game the first time around.
---
What i really enjoy is smaller scale fights and smaller, faster but "squishier" ships where individual pilot skill of every person in my team matters much more than having numbers, or a massive logi wing or simply a good FC. If you ever fly in a small/micro gang with competent people that "click" into place like parts of a well-oiled machine, you'll know what i mean, because there everyone is an FC. Everyone knows what their ship and every other ship in the group needs, can and cannot do. They have to, otherwise they don't survive the response fleet (which is the whole point of ganking that random guy in the myrmidon, to force a response and see how much of it you can kill before you have to leave).
---
There are loads of us who care about the things you think nobody cares about and we don't really care about big fights and capital brawls. Give me small gang roaming, ambushes and guerilla warfare anytime, if i had to fly in capital fleet i'd rather inject bleach into my eyes. Anything bigger than a battleship is way too boring to fly for me, because everything happens in slow motion.
---
You could say that the difference between flying cruisers and smaller vs battleships and bigger is just like the difference between riding a sportbike and driving a SUV. There are people who like both and that's fine, just don't assume that everyone likes what you like.
---
why tho
---
This isn't even a good shitpost. Have some shame
---
1.) Supercapitals are defined specifically as super-carriers and titans, whereas 'regular' capitals are comprised of regular carriers, dreadnaughts and FAXes. Etymologically speaking, I guess the wording developed from the name 'super-carrier', and the Titan being the only ship bigger than that. FAXes were introduced later (only a few years ago), and it's a common belief that all capitals have incorrectly sized ingame models (they are too small), besides FAXes and Titans. 
---
The distinction makes much more sense functionally. Supercaps are an order of magnitude more expensive (regular caps are 1-3b for the hulls, supers are 11-13b, and Titans are 50b give or take, depending on the market etc. etc.). Supercaps also feature an order of magnitude more powerful weapons, tougher tanks, strong innate warp core stability and even some unique utility options such as jump portal generators or electronic warfare projectors. So there is a distinct difference in the power of supercaps versus regular caps. Also, supers can only be produced in sovereign space, whereas anybody can produce regular caps in an NPC station in lowsec. I think that covers most of the important differences. 
---
2.) First of all, it is a widely accepted opinion that arranged fights are lame as hell. Part of the beauty in this game is emergent gameplay and having something to fight *for*, and a lot of that gets lost when you generate fights artificially. Second of all, as rich as they may be, nobody really wants to expose their capital assets (and especially their supercaps) without good reason. This is why in 99% of situations, you will only see supercaps deployed into fights which are heavily in their favor, without much risk of death (or at least, without much *perceived* risk). There have only been a precious few battles in recent history where two sides committed a significant portion of their armada, knowing that their enemy would do the same - namely, the battles of UALX and X47, both of which happened in 2018 (someone will correct me here with more examples, I'm sure). 
---
Finally, just because goons are rich enough to care less about their ships, doesn't mean other factions are too. Even if they wanted to arrange supercap engagements with someone, other people probably wouldn't want to or be able to afford to participate. And when they say they're bored (or when they say anything, really), take it with a grain of salt as most of that is propaganda and boasting, rather than truth or fact.
---
Rush B!
---
Thank Bob somebody said it
---
i think he/she is in love with you
---
This is the side of EVE that you ignore like you ignore your drunk uncle at the Thanksgiving dinner.
---
Star Conflict. Went from being a kickass lobby-based arcade flight shooter in space with reasonably good balance and a non-intrusive pay-to-grind-less model... to a balance-less OP pay2win fest where the latest ship that only came in parts out of loot boxes was solely the most powerful thing in the game, completely crushing and invalidating every single other option, until the next one came out a month or two later, which proceeded to do the same to the ship *it just replaced*. And that's just the tip of the sellout iceberg the game has become. 
---
Though admittedly there were still problems, things were more or less great in 2013-2014. It started going downhill towards the end of 2014 as they started rolling out the new business practice. It was pretty blatant and only got worse.
---
It's a husk of its former self, and the only players left are Russians who don't mind being borderline scammed. Peak concurrent was about 1-2k in 2014, and was down to the *dozens* in 2018.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about. Stukas are a hunting doctrine. We are playing munins online for actual fights. capitals never even get dropped in bloc level fights unless they are dread bombing the guy who keeps feeding vanqs/ or in a gigantic fight where half the server is there.
---
Don’t bother. You’ll just end up disappointed when you get to where they basically gave up trying, added stupid magic stuff and then just gave up altogether.
---
I'll have two pieces of cheese and 500 PLEX pls
---
man, who hurt you? why so salty?
---
capitals aren't a counter to stuka they are triage to save a rorq/super from stukas
---
I'm afraid it's gonna be one of those games where I start playing it, like it and  invest my time on it and then it... shuts down. but i think i'll try it out. some even suggest a few have hundreds of accounts online xD
---
Best i can do is 5 Plex sry mate
---
because he's a retard
---
&gt; you know pyfa is a fitting tool and not a battle simulator right? 
---
you can perfectly simulate how well a ship projects damage to another.
---
&gt; heavy Fighters have travel time and get out run by ab bombers. 
---
ever looked at HF range? well.. why am i asking.. you obviously didnt
---
&gt; But, lets be honest only the galaxy brains like you are shooting the heavy fighters because they do like 10 dps pre resists to an ab bomber (assuming you have enough drone navs to catch them). 
---
give me ONE example of a doctrine that gets used APART from bombers that are able to stay on superblob grids. 
---
stukas are only able to do that because they have low sig, ab AND jump away as soon as fighters are on them. ofc they are doing somewhat ok. but not ANY other popular doctrine is able to do that. thats the problem.
---
&gt;Tell me more about how op heavy fighters are against frigates
---
please quote me on that. or well.. since you cant because i didnt say that just stop talking out of your ass.
---
Thank you for the answers. I appreciate it.
---
Need a bell for the best shame
---
The activity itself hasn't been nerfed. Intel gathering has. Seems like a non issue.
---
If you're in a vaga you can't be far from a loki
---
Like if the game is not on edge of diening then this sure did not help.
---
^ this douche canoe holds no punches when letting people know he doesn't like them because they aren't holebears.
---
it's been declared dying for 16 years
---
it's beyond fine. it's the best game there is. the user numbers are hard to properly interpret because thousands of bots have been banned and their old methods made unusable
---
It's showing that Eve players experience rapid increases in gaming skill, and also *go backwards in time*.
---
the ones that use this have an advantage over real players during the blackout.
---
actually he said every 15 mintues      Not a couple times a week.
---
What does that have anything to do with what I just said?
---
And I'm pretty confident he's full of shit.
---
My Moto G Play  now runs it really well.
---
Thanks! o7
---
Bot much?
---
Crit the hole.
---
Ah okay shifting topics,  and how easy is the game for new players? I love space games so that is one obstacle out of the way.  Looks really good in some videos I've watched. Is it heavy p2w or balanced in that regard?
---
No I don’t like people who I think over exaggerate and I think are lying.
---
This whole game is based around combat, you gotta fight to hold your shit, and if wormholes are fucking with your game that much, harden the fuck up and roll them off, bait them; trap them, etc.
---
Null has all the advantages
---
Wahhhhh. That guy on the Internet said things.
---
Same could be said to you.
---
I think you’re a liar and a bear who is upset he has to do anything but lazily farm over the long weekend.
---
If you want perfect safety, go to highsec
---
I literally just had to repackage over 4k hulls+fits for our restaging. Trust me, it's relevant and massively time consuming with hangar item limits.
---
As to the modules being damaged, it's literally in line with what's being suggested to having the option to repair &amp; repackage.
---
I knew three ex-CVA who were kicked for posting similar comments
---
Is there a way to close the app already? Hitting back wasn't doing anything..
---
i would have a blast if ppl BRING the content to my doorstep every 15min
---
Does Steam even show the players that aren't logged in through Steam? I'm a Steam user but my accounts are from way before it was there.
---
dude just read the post before spewing your salt. I am literally asking for advice on ways to fight better and combat line member burn out. Do you want people to quit the game?
---
It's not gonna shut down anytime soon. Eve is CCP's only source of income so they will keep it running as long as they can. At the moment it is in a bit of a slump, because CCP decided to fuck with nullsec. But we'll see how long that lasts and where they go from there.
---
12th defense fleet in a single day because wormholers are roaming through your space? i have a very hard time believing that....  
---
anyways, in the end it comes down to you crying about that living in NULL SECURITY SPACE requires you to undock and defend your stuff.
---
if i dont like trains, maybe i shouldnt move next to a traintrack. if i dont like snow, maybe i shouldnt live somewhere in the north with alot of snow. if i dont like heat, maybe i shouldt live somewhere where its hot. 
---
and if YOU dont want to defend your stuff/undock maybe you... i think you get it..
---
I nominate this post as Post of the Year.
---
we're recruiting lol
---
I don't know. I just viewed steamcharts site.
---
yikes
---
we were doing that at first but new ones spawn faster than we can keep up. We have started camping the holes instead.
---
Anyone got this in a higher resolution?
---
 &gt;risk averse
---
PvP is not a required part of the game. It's not consensual, but it's also not mandatory for someone to seek it themselves.
---
If someone plays for the PvE experience and accepts that sometimes they'll get into a PvP situation, that doesn't make them risk averse. It just makes them different from you.
---
Anyone complaining that Concord should be preventative rather than punitive, or that their Rorqual died to 20 Drekavacs is just as faulty about their case as a PvPer who complains the krabs he's spewing venom at in local who have maybe a Procurer and a VNI in storage won't fight him and his 4 Orthrus/Retribution friends with high-grade snakes.
---
And when a PvPer complains he can't catch krabs, he's not complaining he won't get a fight, he's complaining he isn't being fed free kills. Ganking a VNI (now a Myrmidon I guess) is not a fight, it's a one-sided gank. Real fights went out the window when the small independents got crushed out of existence by megacoalitions and the fighting entities of old got too big and too bloated with supercaps to ever actually go to war.
---
The saying "Eve is a PvP centric game" parroted by bittervet nanogangers on Reddit is a lie. Eve is a game with PvP and PvE elements. Players can choose either but can't opt out of them, since *someone* has to generate the ISK to buy the Plex the PvPer uses to buy their combat ships.
---
Players are surprisingly more willing to go to battle when it isn't a completely one-sided dunk waiting for them on the undock.
---
I thought you wanted constant content? No?
---
maybe not in android, or because I'm Alpha?  I can click on an untrained skill, but it just shows information, no training button.
---
The steam data only reflect users logged in through steam. You'll find accurate data at https://eve-offline.net/
---
spoiler alert: nothing will happen
---
dude did you read the post? I'm literally asking for advice to better fight and defend the space in the new meta without just burning out my alliance line members. Why is this so hard to understand?
---
Was a fun fight! Would have been fun to see how it played out if Snuff hadnt 3rd partied. See you guys at the final I suppose!
---
Very much alive and in a better place than just a few months ago (less bots)  .  Eve is dying has been a meme for 16years. 
---
The Reddit community can be toxic and don’t listen to the negativity.  Just give the game a try, it’s awesome !!
---
I actually got cancer from reading you reply, so thanks. Arguing with an idiot (you) is like beating my head against a padded wall, I'm not actually making any progress and i still end up with a headache. So i think i will just abstain.
---
Am I crazy or is there no access to view wallet transactions in this app
---
(I’m on iPhone btw so I’m viewing that current release and not the android beta)
---
Take care, he'll start using the entire microsoft arsenal soon.
---
Only steam users
---
It's because if they believe you it kills the narrative if the "elite pvpers" on reddit. They refuse to accept test and goons understand what will happen to small groups in nullsec better than the people who hunt them. They think bleating adapt or die will some how fix it when everyone will adapt to high sec or the null blocs. I hate to say it but ccp seems to be making changes that are leading this way and it's unfortunate that your group is a victim of it. You have got some solid advice here, hopefully it gets your somewhere but reddit is probably not the place to help. The people here want easy kills and don't care how many thousands of players are affected to make their game better.
---
So I get the whole “bitter because someone you really like left without saying anything” as a ceo that hurts.
---
This guy didn’t log on for months, didn’t play, why be this salty? 
---
I purge people who don’t play that long anyways.
---
Silliness on both sides
---
Because I called you an idiot? Welcome to the internet, I'm sure you'll do great.
---
Put the effort in and you don't necessarily have to.  Learn the game through just *playing* and check out some Eve videos on youtube like these:

Lol “combat line member burnout”
---
My krabs are upset reee
---
it is not easy for anybody
---
there is no p2w in the sense that you need to spend dollars to get better stuff. but dollars can buy in game currency, and in game currency cha buy anything.
---
anything except skill and knowledge, which are worth more than isk in every single case
---
So when ccp drives everyone into null blocs or highsec do we get to tell all the reddit pvpers told you so?
---
&gt; how easy is the game for new players?
---
it never was easier than it is now. there are alot of new-player corporations that give you free ships, skillbooks, give lessons and teach you. apart from that, you can play for free as an alpha and decide after that if the game is for you or not.
---
&gt; Is it heavy p2w or balanced in that regard?
---
while you can get everything you want with dumping enough $ into it it doesnt make you a good player. player skill and experience count the most. credit-card warriors die all the time and very often.
---
so yes, ill say its very balanced
---
Ya sad but true, we will keep fighting the good fight though and try to make the small null life work despite all the "leet reddit PVPs" accusations of being no good krabs lol
---
I'm not talking about ganking, I'm talking about PVP... an actual fight...
---
When small groups get run into bigger alliances because the big bad boogeymen from the mean wormhole land came to fight them, it's their fault. That's their nature, claim to be die hard PVPers, until you have to PvP. It's a carebear thing, not something dependant on the meta.
---
probably a good solution for the time being. you could roll in and hobo dread or something for a bit
---
Hi bctech I missed you. UwU
---
And he is using window mode... What a filthy casual !! ò.ó
---
There are good people in Eve. They don't hang around here as much and are more difficult to find in-game, unfortunately. As it is for most games, reddit is where you come to post about a.) the cool thing you did, b.) the game-breaking/unfair bug/exploit you found or c.) bitch and moan about things to rally people that didn't even care to upvote you and bandwagon on the agenda.
---
SOME posts are great indications of the fun and interesting things you can do in the game. Some interesting AARs, exploration stories or instances of player kindness. More often than not, you'd find the subreddit for a game as a detractor and discouraging (to say the least). It isn't specific to Eve, and only heavy moderation and a really good game/community keeps a subreddit out of the toilet.
---
All that being said, you ask for it by posting here. It would be nice to get good input (and you got some, like critting the WHs, encouraging PVP with the WH people, etc), but more often than not you'll only see things along the lines of "git gud," because people are jerks. As a long-time WH resident in the past, I can say that if you provide content, they will only seek you out more. However, (most) WHers are appreciative of a good fight and would rather have those than pounce on a lone PVE ship. Give good fights, chat them up and arrange a good battle even, and you'll get respect and good times. If you always run and hide, they'll hit you even harder. This goes for being in WHs as well, and is a source for eviction from WH space at times, not giving good fights that is.
---
Wish you luck and maybe poke whatever Corps are your neighbors in the alliance and see if they wanna take the good fights to the enemy as well.
---
Also, don't feed the ass-hats on here. Ignore their posts and they don't get what they want. Also, as I said, maybe don't post this stuff here if you want actual good responses and try to find out via in-game channels between your alliance-mates/etc.
---
No! Get fucked.

Pandemic horde will be the easiest to join. All the others require an actual application and let noobs slip through the cracks

Living in wormholes (and regularly scanning out chains from 4 separate systems) I do feel that nullsec connections in particular are more common in all classes of wormhole space than a few months ago. Hard to tell whether that's evidenced though, who really knows?

WTB table of contents.

It's only a few thousand "active" players sure, many of which log in multiple characters at once but the game could be functional with one-quarter the players without shutting down due to the barebones configuration of the company (they shuffled around the last 4 years prepping the company for sale)
---
"active" here refers to the amount of people who may have logged in this week. If you want to look at how many people log in once a month to update something or log in just to collect a reward it will likely be a couple tens of thousands unique players per month
---
What's interesting is steam measures actual unique accounts, not players so it offers hard numbers on the actual eve population. When that goes down, less people are logging in accounts - where as CCPS numbers disguise this data - you cannot tell if its one player with 20k alts or not (multiple accounts still only count as 1 when launching the game through steam).
---
Well, i'm still getting into industrial stuff, so i'll decide to stay in hi-sec atm just to get used to this
---
How about an option to repair Lazer crystals, that would be the bee's knees.
---
I'm not sad
---
is that your standard answer as soon as you realize that your shit you made up and threw around doesnt stick?
---
dont be a shitty mouthbreather, use your brain if you still have a functioning one. and learn how the game works instead of just making things up. might help next time
---
For about 10 more days it is lmao
---
Hey, you're right! Who cares if I enjoyed the game for over a decade, the fact that changes were recently made that I don't like means I should immediately quit the game and stop discussing those changes on the game's subreddit!
---
While I'm at it, I should go file for a divorce because the wife annoyed me earlier. She can keep the kids, too; the little shits didn't clean their rooms last week.
---
Reddit has been expousing on how all this empty space in nullsec will let new groups shine. Except here we see any small group that tries to build up in nullsec just gets feasted on by wormholers. This means those big empty spaces in nullsec are just going to stay empty and more people will join goons/test. This isn't good for the game and all elite pvpers cheering as they keep receiving buffs are to ignorant to understand this.
---
Shame
---
There are four places I suggest if you want to learn more:
---
- The [Fiction Portal](https://fiction.eveonline.com/) is CCP's present gateway to all things lore. However, it is still in development - things being rolled out bit-by-bit.
---
- The [Eve Lore Resources Megathread](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/eve-lore-faq-lore-resources-megathread/25814/) on the Eve Online forums also hosts a repository of sources, along with some common FAQs about Eve's setting.
---
- The [Backstage Lore Wiki](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Main_Page) is a mirrored copy of the CCP's old Eve Wiki before they shut it down. Note that some player-created fiction is stored there as well, but is marked as such. **NOTE:** *The backstage lore wiki is currently down due to server failure. The owner is working on getting it back up and operational again.*
---
- Lastly, the [Roleplay is Primary](https://discord.gg/fUJRaAf) discord server. Even if you don't like roleplay yourself, there's a good overlap between "lore nerds" and "roleplayers", and many of them will be happy to answer your questions.
---
Do note that Tony Gonzales tended to play somewhat "fast and loose" with Eve's setting; what you find there might not match the "feel" of the setting his books give.
---
So you verify every buy order. Also you ARE reliant on pve to file pvp. Like everyone else in the game. How about you nut up and post your zkill
---
Game is alive, player count is doing a landslide due to god awful changes sure, but that's just until Hilmar quits in October after getting his bonus, so it's pretty short lived.
---
No one is even trying to take their sov. They're bitching about having to PvP. Highsec that way ----&gt;
---
Tallulah is a hell of a ganker &lt;3
---
Sometimes the play is made at 0 or not at all.  The cyno will always die in this scenario.
---
While your at it, can you have your community team (Falcon) or Rise, look at the unrest over the new, new cyno change on the official forums? It appears as if they just went LMAO CYA and ghosted.
---
That's a bug in EVE. When you type 
---
     /me winks 
---
it displays 
---
    "J_Hemphill winks"
---
but then when you copy/paste it somewhere else it converts to
---
    /emote winks
---
Steam charts are not an accurate representation of the game's activity at all. Try looking at  [http://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](http://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility)  for a more accurate representation of player activity.  [https://zkillboard.com/](https://zkillboard.com/)  is also another good place to look, if you're specifically interested in PvP.
---
Thanks appreciate the advice its very solid. 
---
Ya we liked the easy content at first and always liked giving the WHers some good fights since we are usually similar size with no blobs. Also knew that running and hiding just makes things worse. 
---
I guess where we are stumbling is with the constant stream of WHers coming in people get tired then make mistakes and that leads to feeding. Once the feeding train starts it just starts to snowball and is really hard to get under control without giving the dreaded "dock up" order.
---
So they just want to make their space unlivable? And when this group leaves and no one comes, who will the wormholers attack then. Do you not see the chain of events here? As wormholers drive more people out of nullsec they will have fewer targets and dog pile the remaining ones even harder. This will cause these targets to leave even faster, accelerating the cycle.
---
Turns out reddit doesn't actually understand what it takes to live in nullsec, because those who are claiming to know only hunt there. The people who live in nullsec have claimed these changes will be bad the entire time.
---
ya we were camping in caps for a while but that gets risky when you are too consistent it lets them plan a trap for you. Right now we are seeing if Tornados on the hole will do the trick.
---
I'm The Mittani's alt. Don't fuck with me.
---
Careful you don't get screen burn-in.
---
Are you still using a tube tv?
---
my brain actually hurts, i think you made me stupider. I cant spend all day debunking things you've made up to support your dumb argument i actually have a life the associated commitments. I really hope there wont be a next time as every time i read something you've written i lose brain cells.
---
Industry from phone when?
---
It was an LCD tv, if you look very carefully you can still see the faint outline of the overview...
---
I would prefer it store the logs in ram and flush to disk on client exit
---
And yet, that means that they won't have months of using that way of cheating and making isk which allows them to just inject right away a new botting account making the ban mean nothing to them.
---
Holy fuck you're such a carebear you don't get it. I'll try one more time because maybe you went back for seconds at the koolaid bar.
---
OP says they're a PVP corp
---
OP grossly overstates that wormholers are coming every fifteen minutes
---
OP complains that said content is being hand delivered to them regularly
---
Wormholers don't care about their useless sov
---
OP's krab alliance could just as easily dock up instead of feed kitchen sink.
---
OP's space will still be there because everyone realizes you can support 40k members on one region.
---
They 1v1 at the top belt and get popped by a mercoxit gas cloud or something, I guess.
---
I think you mean PL, NC, PH, INIT., Bombers Bar vs Legacy. Basically everyone on the server except for Goons.
---
okay thanks for the maths lesson
---
Most EvE players have never used the steam client. I promise you.
---
&gt;LCD 
---
LCD has a very rare chance of getting image persistence/burn in. CRT+Plasma it's common - but that's why no one bothers making them anymore. 
---
These days, most garbage TV's have no burn-in.
---
can my leadership contact you as a reference to confirm it was just a joke?? please i just started ratting here i dont want to have to move my carrier right as cyno changes are about to hit
---
I fucking love people who call me a carebear because I literally haven't killed an npc in 7 years and haven't mined in even longer.
---
Maybe you don't follow. If they have to dock up or defend because wormholers are constantly roaming into their space then why live there? And once they are gone as a target where are the wormholers going to roam. Do you people not understand that only so many people are going to put up with being harassed by wormholers for so long before they leave or join null blocs. As more of those leave you guys are all going to be attacking the same targets. Once everyone leaves you will be crying because why wont someone come live in this nice empty space, we have no targets to hunt.
---
Click scripts aren't EULA legal.
---
Careful bear that slippery slope 😂😂😂
---
stuff i made up? you mean things that are written black on white which you could look up and check? also called facts. 
---
you still didnt answer me why supers are used as much as they are since they are so bad as you said.
---
but its ok. retards arent good at putting up reasonable answers and you are a prime example.
---
loosing more braincells is probably good for you. at some point youll forget how retarded you are.
---
But it seems like i've completed the game
---
Because I know how lazy we can be, and typing is hard... Here's a link:
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/EveEchoes](https://www.reddit.com/r/EveEchoes)
---
I will talk to the people.
---
It won't shut down, that's sure. CCP is making huge changes in favor of PvP, and some people don't like it to the point of leaving the game. That's all.
---
This is a thing I've noticed that bothers me, too. I'll pass it up the chain.
---
Praise be \o/ Best Dev ever
---
Why? it's perfectly fine. Checking other stuff while on fullscreen is a pain.
---
Nah dawg
---
You mean you never loot laser crystals?
---
dont defend their stupidity the console should have not outputed that from the start.
---
I can tell you that one of the curators is trying to update the fittings as one of his priorities. I'm not involved, though.
---
How shit do you have to be that you threaten to drop caps for petty bullshit and yet I've seen hauling alts with better killboards
---
Roll the wormholes away.
---
Bads gonna bad kuz mad kuz bad.
---
Factually supported slope. I see you dodged every other piece of that as well. Even assuming I am wrong about wormholers driving everyone out of nullsec, why the hell should null be specifically adapted for wormholers to go hunt in it. Why the hell is wormhole space now safer than nullsec. And why aren't people like you who celebrate making the game harder not saying something about that?
---
Is it because secretly you don't want your play style nerfed and just want easy shiny kills I wonder?
---
they could plug themselves if you dont mind that.
---
Follow-up to the 'tackle game' thing: The number one thing a nanogang ship hates is long-range tackle. Huginn/Rapier/Loki, Lachesis/Arazu/Keres. 30-50km webs and scrams. Toss a few ships like those into your defense comps, and the nanos will either be forced to run or die. (Note that the nanos know this too, and if they see those ships they *will* almost always get primaried. So fit them out to be overtanked to hell, and make sure your logi watchlists them.) Maybe also consider working with the CovOps Cloaking some of these ships have; let the nanofleet start to engage before decloaking the tackler. Make sure the enemy is within the tackle range and so someone gets snagged and killed.
---
I'm sorry, I thought you were trolling with how shit your logic and reasoning is.
---
major props to panic attack instigating all these fights, good to see!
---
Oh which piece of that logic? 
---
You gotta pvp on reddit since CCP isn't delivering you enough free killmails?
---
Lol no dude
---
Problem with people like you is they think making the other side not want to play means they are winning. So we see where this road logically concludes, the weaponization of autism.
---
It's definitely worth trying! You can give it a go for free with an Alpha account. They train slower and don't have everything in the game unlocked, but it's a good way to try it out and see if youre into it. I'd suggest competing the tutorial missions, seeing what seems interesting, and reading more about it on resources like E-Uni Wiki. That will give you a better idea of the next steps to take
---
Noraus is Elo now, didnt you read the leak :D
---
I have full confidence that by the end of the chaos era (ty based hilmar) that I will be able to rake in all the dank killmails I need without even jumping systems. Maybe october pass will come out with a cyno mod that teleports a stupid krab to me and let me kill it
---
"accurate"
---
Correct because you are more risk averse than the average nullsec krab.
---
If you can field "mass" supers yes you should be able to respond to most scenarios with that, you're risking orders of magnitude higher than your enemies in that scenario.
---
I'm afraid of them tho. That's why I exclusively fly cloaked nano ships so I can hide and run away
---
But what if I told you that I don't know people?
---
If you think Brave can form 100 people from a rageping even in optimal circumstances you're vastly overestimating us
---
See you are trying to troll me right now, but that is actually what the majority of pvpers in nullsec are flying. So you stumbled upon the hidden truth that those players wont admit to.
---
For sure you can play and have fun and be useful in many fleets as an alpha player. Of course if you like the game and keep playing you’ll wish you were omega so you could do more and train faster etc. but that’s the whole point of alpha, it’s the bait to get you to purchase omega :) But if you stayed alpha forever you could still have fun in my opinion.
---
My hauler alt is 88% dangerous
---
You get it.
---
Wow, is it really that bad in the other alliances? have to rent the space to mine in NC? No wonder why All the other blocks having mining and ratting alts in goons.
---
Good stuff thank you!
---
You should probably train for the loki anyway because the skills you need at lv5 would help flying the vagabond or other HACs or pretty much any other ship as well.
---
Can you not already mass-repackage ships? What's the hangar item limit?
---
Did you read the post?
---
Since when is a 700+ member alliance holding half a region (41 systems) considered a "small null alliance"?
---
No, I'm not trolling.
---
You mean a game with event sequences shouldn't output a log of events?
---
Do you have any understanding of game programming at all?
---
It's not that I couldn't fly any PVP ships, I just hadn't ever had a strong desire to pursue it before. I have high covops skills from exploration so I decided to train into a stealth bomber / torpedoes. It was just the excitement of getting a new ship that gave me the kick into learning a new play style and just going out and doing it.
---
Shit happens when the developers actively make a gamer harder to play and hard to enjoy for half the playerbase.
---
Yeah, those haven't existed in any significant capacity in a long time.
---
&gt;Real fights went out the window when the small independents got crushed out of existence by megacoalitions and the fighting entities of old got too big and too bloated with supercaps to ever actually go to war.
---
Calling krabs risk averse is faulty. If you want to assign blame, assign it to megacoalitions who screwed over the only people who actually fight. CCP adding PvE capitals made things worse, but the players ruined it first.
---
&gt; his bus lost one wheel on the way home.
---
And Hy Wanto got away?
---
if the ''other side'' doesnt want to play because the game is getting balanced, that side wasnt a great ''addition'' to the game anyways.
---
 i myself have a super. i would ''suffer'' from a super nerf too. the difference from me to a mouthbreather like you is that i rather have a balanced game with multiple relevant shiphulls than just a handfull like we have now.
---
but as you already prooved, game balance and game knowledge isnt really a thing you have a clue of.
---
it is still doable without bonuses. You just cannot spam click everything like you can with a bonused zeguma.
---
Doesn't matter if you see them coming when you're locked in place for up to 5 minutes, a frigate can go real far in that time
---
AUTZ and huge blob means there's no one else big enough to do it, sadly.
---
Another superbloc would have to go in and squish it like they did Tribute/Vale, but... AUTZ, and also which one would bother? GOTG cozied up to Goons, claiming it was for revenge against PL (which is honestly understandable because PL has a long history of seal clubbing and had it coming) but it let them off the wrath-list.
---
This is textbook megacoalition in practice.
---
What timers are we talking here? Like 0600 with the occasional luck into 0400?
---
This is what CCP doesn't understand. People like me and you quit and just aren't content anymore. Period. We not only flew rorqs and traded and ran the backbone of eve industry, some of us pvpd too. Not everyone enjoys or has time for or has the attention to dedicate to pvp when they sit down to play eve. If pvp was CCPs sole intent for EVE, it wouldnt be one ofnthe most complex industrial and crafting games in the world. We enjoyed this play style. We also had multiple subs.  When a majority of us lost half of the playstyle in eve for us, we unsubbed everything - we took our PVP pilots with us too. People can complain about filthy casuals all they want, but were we content, and did contribute to the bottom line and both sides of killboards.
---
Seems like a reasonable counter to the ability to roll the other holes.
---
Nerf d-scan and be get on with it.
---
Implying any landlord would ever defend their renters. Not that it's the implied understanding between the two entities or anything.
---
Pixel 2 XL here running Android 9 PQ3A build. I haven't had issues with either the regular release or this beta yet. 
---
My one critique. The swipe functions on skill queue are too sensitive making it difficult to manipulate the skills.
---
seems CCP took this study for their how much we invest into eve overall to profit. else i can't explain to a normal human being with a half logical mind how ccp could neglect eve so long.
---
It's a jest on the "felty casual" gamer meme bro, do not take it serious! xD
---
The fuck did I just read
---
&gt; But if you are on the shyer side or don't love talking on comms, it's really easy to just get lost.
---
This is going to be every single newbie oriented corp in the game. The reason is because there isn't enough hours in the day to do outreach to every new player who walks in the door.
---
Oh haha, no no, definitely not. AUTZ makes up a chunk, but a rather small chunk, of the alliance
---
I joined eve university way back in the day and I found the classes a little slow. 
---
I learned way quicker being thrown off the deep end in a small lowsec PvP Corp.
---
In no particular order:
---
Eve will run on a fucking *potato*. You'll have to run the 32bit client which I believe is the default right now, and set it to lowest graphics, but I can and *do* run it quite reliably on a laptop that is literally the size of your phone. The game itself is beautiful at max and being able to run on high settings doesn't actually put as much of a toll on your hardware as you may think, but don't let a bad computer discourage you. The UI may be challenging at first, but it's so in depth that you can play the game mostly fine literally without ever actually forcing the game to render anything.
---
The free account is leaps and bounds better than what the free trials used to offer. Despite the issues they may offer in the broad sense of the game (enabling botters, afk intel, etc), the "Alpha" free accounts are no doubt a good thing for prospective new players, and while it *is* far more difficult than it used to be, you can absolutely pay for a premium "Omega" account by doing activities such as exploration using a free one. 
---
Starting out in Eve is, for lack of a better expression, absolutely fucking *brutal*. I can't sugar coat it. When I started out, I spent literally three hours trying to just open a cargo container from the tutorial mission. Of over 21,000 accounts registered in the first 90 days of 2019, only 1.1% were still playing by day 90, with only 10% sticking around by the end of the first week. 
---
I don't say this to discourage you, however, because CCP has done quite a lot (albiet, far later than they should have, given the game is 16 years old) in order to make the game friendlier yo new players, especially the "Pointer Window", which will actually show you where the buttons you're looking for are and what they do. 10/10 addition, that one. 
---
The single biggest factor in keeping new players, in my opinion, is finding someone to help you out during those first few hours. Even just asking around in the public help channels will drastically improve your experience. However, the best option is to have an existing player take you under their wing and give you some guidance. 
---
One of the best ways to do this is through the Referral Link, because registering through that gives you one million Skill Points. These are important, because you do not "level up" in Eve. You add skills to a training queue, and they train in real-time. Some basic skills at low levels only take minutes, while advanced skills at high levels can take 50 days or more. Fortunately for you, the skills a new player needs don't tend to take very long, and with 1m skill points to use (sparingly, I must advise, they're quite valuable), you'll get about a month of training for free, which I *really* wish I had when I started off. It'll also give the person who referred you a little bonus, if you decide to upgrade to a premium account, which is nice. 
---
As for gameplay: Eve is *not* a flight simulator. You do not *pilot* your ship, so much as you *command* it. Aiming weapons, navigation, and so on is almost entirely automated, with the game playing more like a real-time-strategy game rather than a flight simulator. You can still manually pilot, to a certain degree, but I came into the game expecting something where I could board ships, fight crews, shoot out propulsion, and so on and so forth. Eve is less about that, and more about being a true captain, the god of your own little domain, as you putter about through space. 
---
But what to do? There's exploration in small, nimble ships, risking everything for the chance to make a big payday. There's mission running, a fairly mundane but reliable source of income and a good way for new players to memorize the controls. There's solo PvP, small-gang PvP, and even massive battles with thousands of people, all throughout unique areas of space with their own rules and strategies. You can become a miner, a manufacturing mogul, or a market entrepreneur. Scan and map wormholes for profit or for the good of all New Eden as a volunteer with groups like Signal Cartel, or make your living hauling cargo either on your own or for massive freight companies like PushX or Black Frog. Or, do a little bit of everything. Eve is a sandbox, and it's up to you to decide how you play. 
---
But the most important thing, and I cannot stress this enough, is to *have fun*. You are *going* to die. You *will* lose ships, some of which will be quite expensive. It's gonna suck, but it happens. Remember that you should never fly what you can't afford to lose, but that it's ultimately just a game. With each death, try to learn from your mistakes, and let it be a lesson to continuously improve. It might get you down, I know I've been quite salty before, but as we say, [Killing is Just a Means of Communication](https://youtu.be/JSxNW5dDYEY), and sometimes you just need to [HTFU](https://youtu.be/VgvM7av1o1Q), get a new ship, and go shoot back. Yeah, you might die, but it's having a good time that counts. 
---
And, while we're at it, never forget that the *best* ship in Eve is the Friendship. Eve is absolutely a social game, and I can tell you as someone who has spent quite a bit of money on attending EVE Fanfest, EVE Vegas, EVE North, and others, that the friendships you make along the way are something truly spectacular. I like to say that the only way to actually *lose* Eve is to only play it alone, because even if you only have a small corp of 10 people, you're carving out your own niche in a universe that's been running nonstop since May 6, 2003.

---
&gt;Line members have not been able to rat or mine for longer than 15 minutes at a time for the last week and to be honest it is hurting morale pretty bad. 
---
So this is actually a dynamic that gets completely lost in the haze of krab vs hunter and the world of the blue donut: regular linemember financing. If you're in one of the gigaalliances, your alliance has the resources to fund (or at least SRP) just about anything you could want or need to do, supported by the legions of linemembers. But when you're in a smaller group, that's not an option. You don't have the critical mass to do that, and so the line members need to worry more about their individual finances. And so being stuck in a world where extended krabbing isn't safe because of wormholes everywhere... yeah, that starts to get rough.
---
Ideas
---
* More scouts, more eyes. If you can't roll the wormholes fast enough, then start dropping scouts on the inside of the hole and watch when things start to get interesting
---
* Roll Faster. This might sound wonky, but if you can't close them fast enough then you might need some new tricks. It takes at most 7 rolling battleships (and almost always fewer) to kill a wormhole, so if you can get that many on-hand you can one-shot any incoming hole. Hell you can set up low-SP or even alpha accounts to add to the mix. Slap Hyperspatial Optimization Rigs and Nanofiber Internal Structures onto your rolling ships to buy more speed, since the big factor will be warp flight time. Have someone draw up a set of rolling flowcharts to figure out how to roll any hole in 1 shot. Alternatively, for the holes that are large enough, you can roll in hyperspatted Carriers, which will kill the hole in 1 pass.
---
* For income, Exploration. Relic sites (and turning that salvage into building rigs) is basically my entire income right now. There's bank in that scrap, and for a small group it hopefully shouldn't get too diluted. Hell, if you aren't rolling holes fast enough, start sending explorers *into the holes* to dig up Relics in there!
---
Maybe not yet. Unlike iOS there's a LOT of different Android flavours. Thanks for giving us your model number. It's helpful.
---
Yea do this. 10/10 do recommend.
---
Big call big probably accurate.
---
For the %.000001 of humanity that think rock-paper-scissors-with-spreadsheets is fun, the game will live forever.
---
Game recognize game my man o7
---
&gt; and perfect info that helps bots 100x more than actual players as they just have scripts scanning for info constantly.
---
This literally doesn't matter when bots don't damage the game worth a damn but choosing to address bots sure as hell fucks over players. 
---
Botting is personal not business in EVE - its a shit niche unpopular game that pays less per hour than wow or poe. ISK is so damn worthless its beyond belief.
---
So a handful of people bot and get a titan, in a "pay to win doesn't exist game' so they'll get their titan blown up. The bot menace has always been shit and recently CCP has been capitalizing on this as reasoning for change - playing off reddits back in the last year - and it's goofy.
---
The bot menace is fear and how people are so stupid they'll usher in a worse game so that someone doesn't have an unfair advantage. Every other gaming company determined it wasn't worth ruining their game for less than 1% cheaters.
---
Peligros good at his job and considered necessary and he is, one of the few people who didn't get shitcanned. But understand a lot of this plays into player fears and getting unfavorable development decisions done. Decisions I don't think were required for the game. Decisions that favor the much cheaper cloud technology EVE has to run on for the rest of time as Hilmar pinches every penny.

Multiple characters maybe? I live out in JSpace with a bunch of ~~frat boys~~ fine upstanding gentlemen but I have an extra character who lives in hisec and builds rigs. It's possible to, to some extent, live in multiple worlds.

There are still dojo classes. All classes should be recorded and posted as well. Dojo classes are also open to anyone in the alliance and as far as i know anyone in legacy but they will probably miss it because they don't get pings for them. [The videos are also posted publicly on the dojo youtube page.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7h9KiAtmO6Dkl2IK-cCvw)

Wait, is *that* what I was hearing earlier? I had a character watching a gate and two others mining, and I swore I kept hearing gate activations around the time my characters would warp off-grid to unload.

Eve launched on May 6, 2003.

You ever see people say "Eve is dying"?

Eve is dying, but so are we all. After 16 years it's had plenty of ups and downs, and I'll admit to having concerns about *where* the game's future will take it, but I can quite confidently say that EVE Online still *has* a future.
